7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto the King
14000	16000	Tonight, January 3rd, 2010
16000	18000	What could Google be planning for gaming?
18000	21000	A brand new 8-bit NES game is about to be released
21000	23000	And what in the world is a Wiiwa?
23000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
30000	32000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
32000	35000	And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
35000	38000	We are that show dedicated to video games
38000	42000	Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
42000	44000	Joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts
44000	46000	And with me as always, say hello to the one and only
46000	48000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
50000	52000	Always ready and alert as always, right?
52000	53000	Uh huh
53000	54000	Yeah, exactly
54000	56000	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki
56000	57000	Hello
57000	58000	How you doing, Loki?
58000	59000	Doing fine
59000	60000	I see you YouTubing something over there
60000	61000	What's going on?
61000	63000	I'm just looking at an auction for a bar top cavity
63000	65000	Because it's hilarious how much they try to charge
65000	66000	For these things
66000	68000	Like, they want $900 for this
68000	71000	You can get two full-size arcade games for that
71000	73000	These people are dumb
73000	76000	You know, one story that was given to us this week
76000	78000	That didn't make our show roll tonight though
78000	80000	Because I remember bringing this up on a previous show
80000	84000	But the big Metreon in San Francisco
84000	85000	They're selling all their cabinets
85000	87000	And I know that story made gaming blogs this week
87000	89000	But I think I mentioned that on the show a couple weeks ago
89000	91000	When I was, or maybe about a month ago
91000	92000	When I was there at the Metreon
92000	94000	They're selling a bunch of cabinets
94000	96000	Yeah, they also want too much for their DDR machine too
96000	99000	I remember that they're beating me in a three
99000	100000	They only wanted a few hundred dollars for
100000	101000	Or maybe it was, I don't remember
101000	102000	Maybe it was a thousand or something
102000	105000	But I was seriously considering it
105000	109000	If I wasn't a stinking adult with stinking adult responsibilities
109000	111000	I would have seriously considered it
111000	113000	But alas
113000	115000	Another piece of my car broke this week
115000	117000	And it made me realize, you know
117000	119000	Probably before I indulge in the video game habit
119000	121000	I probably ought to get a car
121000	122000	Probably should
122000	124000	Stupid responsibility
124000	125000	Oh well
125000	128000	Well, Rob, you are almost 75% to a new present
128000	131000	Anyhow, let's uh
131000	133000	Yes, that's right, because you're working on an MP3
133000	136000	Yeah, I've since discovered that
136000	139000	The real player converter will convert to MP3
139000	142000	Off stuff off YouTube
142000	144000	There's a lot of websites that do that too
144000	145000	I've seen that happen
145000	147000	This is so much easier because it just runs in the background
147000	150000	And it works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox
150000	154000	So enjoy your gift of Angela Aki covers
154000	155000	Sweet
155000	156000	Anyhow
156000	158000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks
158000	160000	And the types of stuff we've been playing
160000	161000	I know maybe because of the holidays
161000	163000	Not everyone's really been gaming
163000	164000	I don't know
164000	165000	But we'll go around and check in with everybody
165000	167000	Anyway, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
167000	169000	Peggle-rific
169000	171000	I'm playing through challenge mode on Peggle right now
171000	174000	And I've beaten three of the five point stages
174000	177000	It's freaking hard
177000	179000	On the iPhone
179000	183000	And then we had a bunch of
183000	185000	Raiden 4 going on in the house last night
185000	187000	And then they were all
187000	188000	No, let's watch Macross
188000	190000	So they were watching Macross
190000	191000	Macross Frontier
191000	194000	I actually dropped by randomly yesterday
194000	195000	Yes
195000	197000	Because I wanted to show a friend the OLR studio
197000	199000	And we had Sonic
199000	201000	Yeah, you guys were watching Macross
201000	203000	And I was kind of like, oh, anime
203000	204000	That I'm not familiar with
204000	207000	Because I don't follow anime as closely as I think a lot of our listeners do
207000	210000	I don't follow it nearly as much as I used to
210000	212000	But we have plenty of friends that do
212000	214000	And Dan's like, oh, bring it over, let's see what's new
214000	215000	Good times
215000	217000	They had Hetalia, which I love
217000	221000	That's the one where it's different personifications of countries
221000	223000	So all the different countries are characters
223000	226000	And America is trying to solve everything through cheeseburgers
226000	228000	And Japan is very soft-spoken
228000	230000	And never gives a clear answer
230000	233000	Dan's still playing the hell out of Borderlands, out of curiosity?
233000	234000	Yeah, pretty much
234000	237000	But he's actually played through
237000	238000	Ikaruga the other night
238000	240000	I was going to say, when I came over the other night
240000	244000	They were playing some Japanese shooter game on 360
244000	246000	I wasn't sure if it was Triggerheart, Excellica
246000	248000	I only glanced at it for a second
248000	249000	It was Ikaruga? Okay
249000	250000	Yeah
250000	251000	Because they were actually watching playthroughs
251000	253000	Of other people doing tricks
253000	255000	So they decided they were going to do them themselves
255000	258000	I think they watched some guy do a perfect playthrough of Ikaruga
258000	260000	And decided that they wanted to do it
260000	262000	Alright
262000	264000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week? What did you do?
264000	266000	I too played Ikaruga on my arcade cabinet
266000	268000	Because I was working on getting Naomi's stuff
268000	270000	Random, okay
270000	277000	I was working on getting my Naomi and a Thomas Wave
277000	283000	And actually also my Zinc emulation running
283000	285000	Zinc though doesn't seem to run very well
285000	289000	The loader that I have for it sucks
289000	292000	So I have to do it by hand
292000	294000	But I tried playing Urguts
294000	295000	And that's pretty fun
295000	297000	Except I wish the Japanese ROM would work
297000	300000	Because I think the US one doesn't have Cloud in it
300000	301000	Yes it does
301000	302000	It does?
302000	304000	Ask with Cloud and Tifa because I've played one
304000	306000	Do I have to unlock it or something?
306000	309000	I do not remember because it's been a long time since I've played it
309000	311000	But I thought it was either that or time released
311000	313000	Or that it's like some little trick you have to do
313000	317000	But yeah, I've played both of them in the American cabinet
317000	319000	Well then I will have to mess around with that
319000	321000	But in the meantime I couldn't get any of the controls to work
321000	324000	Even though I configured them correctly
324000	326000	It's just being retarded
326000	329000	I did play a little bit of Thomas Wave
329000	332000	Had a little bit of Dolphin Blue
332000	334000	Which for those who aren't familiar
334000	336000	Is another game that's very similar to Metal Slug
336000	338000	Done by the creators of Metal Slug
338000	339000	And when you play the game you're like
339000	341000	Oh wow, this is almost like Metal Slug
341000	343000	Except they're riding dolphins
343000	345000	So that was kind of fun
345000	348000	And then I tried to get Marvel vs. Capcom 2 working
348000	353000	But I think it may be a little too much for my processor
353000	355000	And the arcade cabinet
355000	357000	Because it's only 2.2 GHz
357000	360000	Whereas you probably need a little bit more than that
360000	363000	So I actually have to overclock it since I can do that
363000	366000	So maybe that'll fix it
366000	368000	Because right now the sound's a little laggy
368000	370000	And it's kind of annoying
370000	374000	Then let's see what else did I play
374000	376000	Other than Ikaruga
376000	380000	Oh, Guilty Gear Iizuka
380000	382000	Which is interesting because I didn't realize
382000	384000	That they had a four player Guilty Gear game
384000	386000	So that was neat
386000	390000	Then other than arcade cabinet stuff
390000	392000	I played through the rest of the Little Big Planet
392000	395000	Pirates of the Caribbean level pack
395000	396000	And it was alright
396000	399000	It wasn't as cool as the Metal Gear Solid pack
399000	401000	But it was pretty good
401000	404000	Still worth the five or six bucks that you have to pay for it
404000	407000	But still, how can you top guns?
407000	409000	I mean, it's tough
409000	411000	So it's understandable
413000	415000	Then of course more Grand Theft Auto
415000	417000	Still no Borderlands
417000	419000	Thought about it, but been working on the cabinet
419000	421000	So I haven't had a chance to play anything
421000	424000	I have Borderlands
424000	426000	I just haven't played it
426000	429000	I've been sitting on it for weeks now
429000	431000	Months now actually
431000	433000	I'll eventually get around to it
433000	434000	I'd like to play it too
434000	436000	So if you don't ever crack open that copy
436000	438000	Oh, it's cracked open
438000	439000	It's ready to go
439000	441000	I just haven't gotten a chance to do it yet
441000	443000	When are you bringing Bayonetta over for me?
443000	445000	The damn thing's out this week, right?
445000	446000	This week or next?
446000	447000	Very soon
447000	451000	Hopefully, if your husband knows Jamie
451000	453000	He'll be bringing it home
453000	455000	It's pretty awesome
455000	457000	So yeah, definitely check that out this week
459000	460000	Yeah, I think that's really
460000	462000	I mean, last week we had some pretty epic
462000	464000	Grand Theft Auto games
464000	466000	Because of everybody being off
466000	469000	Funny enough though, we actually were playing against people in the UK
469000	472000	Because I guess it was probably evening over there in the UK when we were playing
472000	474000	I think they're about eight hours ahead of us
474000	476000	Okay, so they are about evening
476000	478000	It was funny though
478000	480000	Because we had some people playing
480000	482000	And we can hear them over the headsets
482000	484000	And they're, I'm gonna get
484000	487000	I'm gonna get the call in the green
487000	489000	That little wanker
489000	491000	No wanker
491000	494000	So I'm gonna get the green fella
494000	496000	I like getting cussed at in
496000	499000	I don't want to say other languages
499000	501000	But other dialects, I guess you could say
501000	503000	You know, getting called a poof
503000	506000	And you know, all those other types of words
506000	508000	It was pretty brutal though
508000	510000	I had 47 kills in 20 minutes
510000	512000	With a streak of 14
512000	516000	And people were pissed
516000	517000	So it was fun
517000	519000	In fact, actually the second player
519000	521000	Second place had half as many
521000	523000	Actually less than half as many kills as I did
523000	525000	So it was fun
525000	528000	So that's what I've been playing
528000	530000	All that fun stuff
530000	532000	Awesome
532000	534000	I'm just imagining all the little talk
534000	536000	On Grand Theft Auto
536000	537000	We don't talk back
537000	539000	Because it's hard to wear headphones and a headset
539000	540000	At the same time
540000	542000	So we just listen to it
542000	543000	And it's funny
543000	544000	Has anyone invented that?
544000	545000	Like a third party?
545000	546000	A headphone slash headset?
546000	547000	They have
547000	549000	My actual new 5.1 headset
549000	551000	Which by the way
551000	553000	And I don't know why these headsets do this
553000	556000	But one of the channels is already cutting out on it
556000	559000	Because I guess the cord is so heavy
559000	561000	That it's pulling it out a little bit
561000	562000	I'm only getting that
562000	563000	One speaker
563000	564000	Which is annoying
564000	566000	But I've had other headsets do the same thing
566000	568000	But yeah, they have Turtle Beach headsets
568000	569000	But they're like $100
569000	571000	I think the cheapest one you can get that has that built in
571000	572000	Is like
572000	573000	I don't know
573000	574000	Maybe
574000	575000	$60
575000	577000	But really what they need to come up with
577000	578000	Excuse me
578000	581000	Is a clip-on microphone or something like that
581000	583000	That you can just wear so you can talk
583000	585000	Because you don't really need the headset to hear people talking
585000	588000	Most games have a way you can listen to it
588000	590000	Through your actual headphones
590000	591000	So
591000	593000	That's all you really need
593000	594000	Is just that
594000	596000	Because it's just really awkward the way it is
596000	599000	Going to the chat room of course
599000	601000	Our always present forth guests on the show
601000	602000	Chat.orangelandradio.com

616000	617000	Chat.orangelandradio.com
617000	620000	SSJ100Matt says I thought Rob's British accent
620000	621000	Is banned from the show
621000	623000	I don't remember that getting an official banning
623000	625000	But fine it'll be my Welsh accent there
625000	627000	Anyhow
627000	628000	Going into
628000	630000	It's not sing-songy enough
632000	633000	I'll work on it
633000	635000	If my Japanese pronunciation got better
635000	638000	Maybe I should resolve this year to work on my British accent
638000	639000	I don't know
639000	642000	I'll have to Skype some of our British listeners
642000	644000	And say please teach me how to say cute things
644000	646000	And you know I'll teach you
646000	648000	Teach me how to speak English English
648000	651000	Yes please teach me how to speak English
651000	653000	I can't even do that on the show
653000	656000	If you've listened to the past two or three months of show
656000	658000	I don't know if it's because I have to multitask a lot
658000	660000	While doing the show or what
660000	662000	But sometimes the things that come out of my mouth
662000	663000	I'm like what did I say
663000	665000	I just totally butchered the English language
665000	667000	I need English lessons from an English person
667000	668000	That's what I need
668000	669000	Anyhow
669000	671000	You know they do have those
671000	674000	I want to say that it's
674000	677000	They actually have like British English
677000	680000	As you know a language learning system
680000	683000	Like is that something I can get the Rosetta Stone for
683000	684000	Yes
684000	686000	I'm serious I think they do have that
686000	688000	I actually probably have that
688000	690000	Since I downloaded all of them at some point
690000	691000	Call it a hunch
691000	693000	But I think that was made for people
693000	695000	That don't have English as a first language
695000	697000	That maybe want to move to London
697000	698000	Or those places you know
698000	700000	But then you pick it up quick
701000	702000	I stopped being a wanker
702000	703000	You can speak like them
703000	704000	Stop being a wanker
704000	705000	Alright let's see
705000	706000	My gaming week
706000	709000	Actually I played a crap ton of games
709000	711000	I know I usually get on here and like
711000	712000	I played WoW
712000	713000	And I did play WoW
713000	715000	I finally hit level 80 on my paladin
715000	716000	Thank you very much
716000	717000	Da da da da
717000	718000	So I did that
718000	720000	Stop sighing over there DarkSakura
720000	721000	That was a yawn
721000	722000	Sorry
722000	724000	Well I didn't just play WoW
724000	726000	I actually played a lot of games
726000	727000	Because here you go
727000	728000	Wake up for this DarkSakura
728000	729000	This is very important
729000	731000	I have a 360 again
731000	733000	That sounds like a personal problem
733000	734000	Shut up
734000	736000	Now after the whole like what
736000	737000	Four or five months
737000	738000	I haven't had one
738000	741000	It was like August 11th or something
741000	742000	That update came out
742000	743000	That borked my 360
743000	745000	I finally have a new 360
745000	747000	And I spent a lot of time
747000	749000	Just catching up on stuff
749000	751000	I just filled up my queue
751000	752000	With like Kix
752000	754000	And Bubble Bobble Neo
754000	755000	And Rainbow Islands
755000	756000	None of these games
756000	758000	I played really in depth
758000	759000	In fact oddly enough
759000	761000	The game I probably played more than anything
761000	762000	I went back
762000	764000	I just had this itching to play
764000	766000	Castlevania Symphony of the Night
766000	768000	It probably has something to do with the fact
768000	770000	That that's like one of the best games ever made
770000	772000	That I wanted to go back and play it
772000	775000	And that I never really played it through to completion on 360
775000	777000	So I've been sinking a lot of time into that
777000	778000	Also though
778000	780000	Speaking of Castlevania and that whole
780000	781000	You know Metroid
781000	782000	And the exploration game
782000	785000	One game that just kind of wasn't on my radar last year
785000	786000	Was Shadow Complex
786000	788000	And I finally took the opportunity to play
788000	790000	And I finally took the opportunity to download Shadow Complex
790000	792000	To my 360 and check it out
792000	794000	And wow
794000	796000	Did I miss that
796000	798000	Like seriously
798000	800000	That game was kind of awesome
800000	802000	And by kind of I mean really
802000	805000	It is like a Super Metroid
805000	807000	Castlevania type exploration game
807000	809000	But a little more modernized you know
809000	810000	And part
810000	811000	I gotta be honest
811000	813000	Part of what kept me away from looking at that game before
813000	815000	Is when I was looking at the screenshots and everything
815000	816000	I was like
816000	818000	Looks like a clancy
818000	820000	Espionage kind of game
820000	822000	And I'm not usually into those games
822000	824000	I don't want to play a gun scope killing game
824000	826000	I don't really like those kind of games
826000	827000	I will admit
827000	828000	That was ignorant of me
828000	829000	Very ignorant
829000	833000	But I finally got over it
833000	834000	And downloaded the game
834000	835000	And I had an awesome time with it
835000	838000	I am really wanting to play that game through to completion
838000	840000	And I highly recommend it
840000	841000	It was fun
841000	844000	I was impressed by how much they crammed into
844000	846000	An arcade download
846000	848000	Because seriously
848000	851000	They could charge 30 bucks for this stuff on Blu-ray
851000	852000	Or I'm sorry
852000	853000	It's 360
853000	855000	They could charge this on a DVD
855000	857000	And put it in stores
857000	859000	And most folks would be none the wiser
859000	860000	So
860000	861000	Yeah
861000	863000	I was very excited to play Shadow Complex
863000	865000	I'll spend a little bit of time with Gyromancer
865000	867000	Which I played on the PC a little bit ago
867000	869000	But one of my friends sat me down
869000	871000	And kind of explained the game a little better
871000	873000	Because I gotta admit the tutorial
873000	875000	The game kind of is very wordy
875000	877000	Didn't make a whole lot of sense
877000	879000	But having it explained to me really helped
879000	881000	Once I'm able to get over that hurdle
881000	883000	Of thinking about the board
883000	885000	Like it's regular Bejeweled
885000	887000	And thinking of it like Bejeweled Twist
887000	889000	The game is very interesting
889000	892000	And I actually think it's a little more accessible
892000	893000	Than Puzzle Quest
893000	894000	Which was just
894000	895000	Battle after battle
895000	896000	After micromanaging
896000	897000	After micromanaging
897000	899000	Gyromancer does feel a little more straightforward
899000	901000	Like there is a start any finish
901000	902000	And yes you have these maps
902000	903000	You can go back and play them
903000	905000	But there just seems to be
905000	906000	I don't know
906000	908000	I feel more accomplished playing Gyromancer
908000	910000	Like I feel like I got nowhere in Puzzle Quest
910000	912000	Because I didn't spend a hundred hours with it
912000	913000	But yeah
913000	915000	I'm looking forward to spending more time with Gyromancer
915000	918000	And you know one thing that a lot of folks asked
918000	920000	When I got the 360
920000	922000	Because I had to do that mandatory tweet
922000	924000	From Twitter on the 360
924000	925000	Where I said
925000	926000	Hi I'm tweeting for my 360
926000	928000	Because I think everybody did that tweet
928000	929000	When it first came out
929000	930000	Didn't
930000	931000	Well those that used Twitter anyway
931000	932000	That's what you do
932000	934000	Did you even bother to look at it on the 360?
934000	935000	No
935000	936000	Well that's why
936000	937000	Because I didn't care
937000	938000	I have it on my computer
938000	939000	I got to be honest
939000	940000	It's really nothing
940000	943000	Like it's a frivolous silly thing on the 360
943000	947000	And probably is something most people look at only once
947000	950000	I got to say I did play with Facebook a little bit too
950000	953000	And I think Facebook looks hideous on the 360
953000	954000	I hate the way it's laid out
954000	957000	Because they try to put Facebook in the Xbox crossbar format
957000	959000	Which the more and more I use it
959000	961000	The more and more I really don't like the NXC
961000	963000	I just I love all the features
963000	964000	I hate the layout
964000	966000	Like what they had before
966000	967000	I honestly think was better
967000	968000	But whatever
968000	970000	The cool thing about Facebook is that
970000	973000	You can find friends on Facebook
973000	974000	That are on 360
974000	976000	And you can find friends on 360
976000	977000	That are on Facebook
977000	979000	Like the gamer tags and names are linked
979000	981000	So like maybe I have people on my Xbox list
981000	983000	That I didn't have added on Facebook
983000	984000	Or like for example
984000	988000	Somehow I didn't have Tiara on my Xbox 360 list
988000	990000	But I found because she's on my Facebook
990000	991000	That she had a gamer tag
991000	992000	So I sent her a friend request
992000	993000	So Tiara if you're listening
993000	994000	Accept my friend request
994000	996000	You're making me cry
996000	1000000	And of course I had to play a little bit of last FM2
1000000	1002000	I had to catch up on all this crap I missed
1002000	1003000	I realized this is like months old
1003000	1004000	That it was all new to me
1004000	1007000	But anyway the Twitter response I got to my tweet
1007000	1010000	About hi for my 360 I have one again was
1010000	1014000	Oh well guess your Playstation 3 is going to be collecting dust now huh?
1014000	1016000	No I think
1016000	1018000	Honestly this little bit of downtime
1018000	1020000	Has really raised my respect for Sony
1020000	1022000	Because I know we've given them a lot of crap on the show
1022000	1023000	And rightfully so
1023000	1024000	Don't get me wrong
1024000	1025000	I haven't suddenly said
1025000	1027000	Sony has forgiven for everything they've done wrong
1027000	1031000	I think they made lots and lots of great improvements in 09
1031000	1034000	And you know there's things I look forward to from them in 2010
1034000	1036000	And in fact there's going to be some cases
1036000	1037000	Where it's 360 versus Playstation 3
1037000	1039000	I'm going the route of Playstation 3
1039000	1040000	For example Final Fantasy 13
1040000	1042000	I plan to buy that on Playstation 3
1042000	1043000	Better controller
1043000	1045000	I think the game was designed for that in the first place
1045000	1047000	That's just where I'm going
1047000	1049000	Microsoft fans put down the hate mail
1049000	1051000	Because there's some things I'm going to opt for on 360 as well
1051000	1053000	For instance a lot of the things that have online play
1053000	1055000	I just know more people on 360
1055000	1057000	That's probably where I'll go with those games
1057000	1059000	Plus I'm still playing a lot of DJ Hero
1059000	1061000	And that's on Playstation 3 for me
1061000	1063000	So I have to throw that out there too
1063000	1067000	I finally got the trophy for playing every song in the game at least once
1067000	1069000	Even the songs I didn't want to play
1069000	1071000	I finally played everything at least once
1071000	1073000	So making good progress there
1073000	1076000	Let's see I'm going to our chatroom again
1076000	1078000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com
1078000	1080000	Some people wondering what NXC was
1080000	1082000	Because I just rattled that off
1082000	1083000	Yeah that's the new Xbox experience
1083000	1085000	That's the new interface they launched
1085000	1087000	When was that? Was that last holiday?
1087000	1089000	That was about September of 2008
1089000	1090000	I think so
1090000	1092000	When they switched from what was called the Blades to this new system
1092000	1094000	That I can't stand
1094000	1096000	I cannot stand the new 360 layout
1096000	1098000	I love it
1098000	1100000	Sony fans, I'll give you that
1100000	1102000	I think Playstation 3 makes a hell of a lot more sense
1102000	1104000	Than 360 does to navigate around
1104000	1107000	I actually think it's really simple how they have it set up
1107000	1109000	There's so much useless garbage in there
1109000	1113000	Do you know how long it took me to figure out how to change my theme?
1113000	1115000	Like something that shouldn't be that hard
1115000	1118000	Oh I have to go into Myself
1118000	1119000	And then it's there
1119000	1121000	Oh it's not in the guide button
1121000	1123000	It's not in these other settings page
1123000	1125000	Oh I have to do this and this
1125000	1127000	I thought that made perfect sense for it to be there
1127000	1130000	I mean if it's my theme it would be my preference
1130000	1133000	But there's nowhere on that box to say my preferences
1133000	1135000	In fact if you hit the guide button and go into preferences
1135000	1137000	You get a bunch of console preferences
1137000	1139000	That have nothing to do with theme
1139000	1143000	But like parental guides and user ratings and things I thought I disabled
1143000	1145000	That's not where I thought to go
1145000	1147000	I like it better
1147000	1149000	I like how it's laid out better
1149000	1151000	I think that it makes a lot more sense the way it's laid out
1151000	1156000	The only thing that I don't like is just the ads
1156000	1158000	I guess for the stuff that I don't care about
1158000	1160000	But really the stuff that I want to get to quickly
1160000	1162000	I can get to very quickly
1162000	1164000	And to be fair Sony has the ads too
1164000	1166000	So if I'm going to hate it on 360 I have to hate it on Sony
1166000	1169000	But I don't know the crossbar just works better for me
1169000	1171000	Than NXT has been working
1171000	1173000	But to Microsoft's credit
1173000	1176000	They tend to upgrade their crap pretty fast
1176000	1179000	And maybe some of these things that I'm QQing about
1179000	1181000	They will fix on the next update
1181000	1183000	Even though I think they're only doing them yearly now
1183000	1184000	I'm not sure
1184000	1185000	Anyhow
1185000	1187000	That's pretty much it for my gaming week
1187000	1189000	I know I talked about a lot of games
1189000	1191000	And really I didn't even talk about everything I played
1191000	1193000	Because I went on a shopping spree on Steam
1193000	1196000	Because they've been having their massive holiday sale
1196000	1198000	I don't know if you guys have looked at this
1198000	1201000	Dude I got Morrowind for five bucks yesterday
1201000	1203000	Just because it was five bucks
1203000	1205000	And I liked Oblivion yet I never played Morrowind
1205000	1207000	So I was like I'm going to drop five bucks on it
1207000	1209000	And I got Luminous last week
1209000	1211000	And I think there was another game I bought too
1211000	1214000	That's the problem with this stinkin' Steam sale
1214000	1216000	Is that yeah the games are only five bucks
1216000	1218000	But suddenly I bought four of them
1218000	1220000	I dropped twenty
1220000	1222000	You've just been friended Rob
1222000	1224000	Yay! Did you get a message from Tiara?
1224000	1225000	She's listening
1225000	1227000	Thank you Tiara
1227000	1229000	Now I'm going to kick your ass in Puzzle Fighter
1229000	1230000	I'm just kidding
1230000	1232000	Alright we'll rock band or something
1232000	1234000	Anyhow that's it for my gaming week
1234000	1236000	So let's go to housekeeping
1236000	1239000	Podcast listeners I know you thought we've neglected you
1239000	1241000	And I'm sorry and that's my bad
1241000	1243000	That has nothing to do with Jamie or Matt
1243000	1245000	That's my responsibility and I've really slacked on it over the holidays
1245000	1247000	But I cracked the whip today
1247000	1249000	I got all four shows from December up
1249000	1251000	And we are caught up
1251000	1252000	And one of my
1252000	1254000	Although I don't like to make New Year's resolutions
1254000	1256000	One of my goals let's say for 2010
1256000	1258000	Is to do Monday turnarounds on the shows
1258000	1260000	So that those are up on the feeds on Monday
1260000	1262000	So keep me on my toes
1262000	1264000	Twitters and Facebookers
1264000	1266000	If I don't have the show up
1266000	1268000	Tell me just quit playing WoW and get the damn show up
1268000	1270000	It is by the way it is not as simple as
1270000	1272000	Just clicking a button that says upload
1272000	1274000	Because we do edit the show
1274000	1276000	We don't say edit, we don't edit content
1276000	1278000	We don't really edit anything out unless there's
1278000	1280000	Like a huge technical failure that causes the show
1280000	1282000	To go down for ten minutes or something
1282000	1284000	But we have to clean up the actual MP3s themselves
1284000	1286000	Take out the little, you know
1286000	1288000	You're listening to all games radio and all that
1288000	1290000	And the little stuff that gets in the master file
1290000	1292000	And all that technical jumbo
1292000	1294000	And then we have to string it together to one file
1294000	1296000	Because we can't put the music break up
1296000	1298000	And put that all up so
1298000	1300000	It is a little more than just clicking a button that says upload
1300000	1302000	Anyhow
1302000	1304000	I'm not the technical jabber behind the show
1304000	1306000	I do want to say one other bit of housekeeping
1306000	1308000	I will not be here in two weeks
1308000	1310000	I have a long weekend
1310000	1312000	Martin Luther King is holiday for me
1312000	1314000	So I actually am taking a long weekend
1314000	1316000	To go to Seattle
1316000	1318000	There's nothing going on out there
1318000	1320000	I'm just going to say hey
1320000	1322000	And be a tourist for a little while
1322000	1324000	I will not be here though because I'm coming home on Monday
1324000	1326000	So I believe
1326000	1328000	One of our long time listeners
1328000	1330000	And listened so long we just made him
1330000	1332000	One that Suya is cooking up a best of
1332000	1334000	That I'm hoping we'll be ready by that week
1334000	1336000	So that's very exciting
1336000	1338000	Also later in tonight's show
1338000	1340000	Listless is coming back
1340000	1342000	We haven't done Listless in forever
1342000	1344000	We're doing one tonight
1344000	1346000	And our old pal Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us
1346000	1348000	Is going to join us
1348000	1350000	Because he always has us on his show
1350000	1352000	But we never seem to get him on ours
1352000	1354000	Because we're on after him
1354000	1356000	So there's no real tease at the end of the show
1356000	1358000	Because we go off air at that point
1358000	1360000	To at least say thank you and let him participate
1360000	1362000	In our silly little game
1362000	1364000	But before we get to the games we get to the news
1364000	1366000	Loki
1366000	1368000	Yes there's a rumor
1368000	1370000	Kind of evolving the
1370000	1372000	Development of the Playstation 4
1372000	1374000	Which you know
1374000	1376000	You know it's coming eventually
1376000	1378000	And obviously they're probably
1378000	1380000	You know they started work on it
1380000	1382000	The day after the Playstation 3 came out
1384000	1386000	So one of the
1386000	1388000	Possible pieces of technology
1388000	1390000	That will be in the Playstation 4
1390000	1392000	And possibly considered for
1392000	1394000	You know additional
1394000	1396000	Units afterwards
1396000	1398000	Would be this thing called
1398000	1400000	Project Larrabee
1400000	1402000	And what it is
1402000	1404000	It's actually a
1404000	1406000	A piece of hardware
1406000	1408000	Developed by Intel
1408000	1410000	And it's kind of an architecture
1410000	1412000	That revolves around
1412000	1414000	A lot of CPU's that's for sure
1414000	1416000	You know the
1416000	1418000	Kind of diagram that they have
1418000	1420000	They have a bunch of different CPU cores
1420000	1422000	Including this picture I think it's about
1422000	1424000	16 cores
1424000	1426000	And each with their own
1426000	1428000	Cache and kind of revolving
1428000	1430000	Around this thing they call a ring bus
1432000	1434000	Very cool looking
1434000	1436000	And I guess it's
1436000	1438000	Supposed to be
1438000	1440000	Obviously very different than the cell
1440000	1442000	Architecture that's available now
1442000	1444000	I imagine since it's kind of being developed
1444000	1446000	Around technology that's
1446000	1448000	Around new multi-cell processors
1448000	1450000	That something like this wouldn't be
1450000	1452000	Too
1452000	1454000	Too hard to develop or too hard to
1454000	1456000	Manufacture
1456000	1458000	And this is coming from
1458000	1460000	PC Watch's
1460000	1462000	Hirosinji Goto
1462000	1464000	Naming some
1464000	1466000	Unnamed sources
1466000	1468000	Familiar with Intel's long waited Larrabee project
1468000	1470000	And also
1470000	1472000	Apparently Intel was
1472000	1474000	Pursuing relationships with Microsoft and Nintendo
1474000	1476000	As well for their next gen consoles
1476000	1478000	So maybe this
1478000	1480000	Technology might not be only in this
1480000	1482000	You know Sony console
1482000	1484000	And who knows if it's even going to be in the Sony console
1484000	1486000	But
1486000	1488000	I don't know it's kind of neat
1488000	1490000	And something like this you know
1490000	1492000	They could definitely scale it
1492000	1494000	To however many
1494000	1496000	I guess processors they want in there
1496000	1500000	Akdeft in chat says breaking news PS4 is coming eventually
1500000	1502000	Which I think is what a lot of us
1502000	1504000	That just kind of looked at the story went
1504000	1506000	Yeah okay so PS4 they're already planning some of the stuff for it
1506000	1508000	Sure it's going to happen sometime
1508000	1510000	What would this really mean for the system
1510000	1512000	I mean is this just a boost in power
1512000	1514000	Is this
1514000	1516000	You know is this
1516000	1518000	Vaporware like the emotion engine chip
1518000	1520000	Or I mean what is this
1520000	1522000	Well multi-processors like that I mean obviously
1522000	1524000	It's going to be the crunch everything from graphics
1524000	1526000	To physics
1526000	1528000	To game logic
1528000	1530000	Whatever I mean so with this obviously
1530000	1532000	You're going to be able to push
1532000	1534000	Better graphics you know
1534000	1536000	Better physics in the games
1536000	1538000	You know more detailed
1538000	1540000	Gameplay
1540000	1542000	You know better sound
1542000	1544000	You know a whole lot more detail in there
1544000	1546000	Problem is though when you are able
1546000	1548000	To push that much details
1548000	1550000	You have to also create that much detail
1550000	1552000	And then development costs rise
1552000	1554000	And so on and so forth
1554000	1556000	So there is you know
1556000	1558000	Kind of a
1558000	1560000	Downside to everything
1560000	1562000	That's how Nintendo is kind of getting around it
1562000	1564000	Because their system isn't really pushing that
1564000	1566000	You know great graphics
1566000	1568000	Although there are companies that will try to kind of
1568000	1570000	Squeeze every ounce of
1570000	1572000	You know power out of the Wii
1572000	1574000	You know you don't have to
1574000	1576000	Because their console doesn't look that
1576000	1578000	I mean there's only so much they can do
1578000	1580000	Graphic wise in there so
1580000	1582000	Kind of to let the gameplay
1582000	1584000	Shine through but with Sony though
1584000	1586000	You know it's really all about
1586000	1590000	Just trying to push
1590000	1592000	Better graphics
1592000	1594000	Better specs, better everything
1594000	1596000	I mean that's really what they've been
1596000	1598000	Doing from the get go
1598000	1600000	That's what they've been really pushing with
1600000	1602000	You know remember with the Playstation 3
1602000	1604000	They're like oh yeah all the games are going to come out 10EP
1604000	1606000	Everything is going to run at 120 frames per second
1606000	1608000	It's going to be super awesome
1608000	1610000	You're just going to blow your load when you see anything on the screen
1610000	1612000	You know that type of stuff
1612000	1614000	And obviously that didn't really happen
1614000	1616000	I mean a lot of this stuff comes out now
1616000	1620000	720p, nothing is running at 120 frames per second
1620000	1622000	I mean TV's
1622000	1624000	Most TV's out there don't even
1624000	1626000	You wouldn't be able to see that so
1626000	1628000	Let me ask a weird like maybe tangent kind of question
1628000	1630000	That I don't even know if it has an easy answer
1630000	1632000	So I'm really posing this to Chad as well
1632000	1634000	I know we say this a lot
1634000	1636000	I've said this as a kid
1636000	1638000	And I've said this growing up
1638000	1640000	And I'm sure a lot of you did this too
1640000	1642000	Like even back in the Nintendo days
1642000	1644000	8 bit NES days
1644000	1646000	Dude games look so realistic now
1646000	1648000	I don't know how they're going to look any better
1648000	1650000	I mean it looks like a cartoon on my screen
1650000	1652000	It's awesome right
1652000	1654000	We always kind of say that and then somehow they get better
1654000	1656000	But I really feel like we're at this point now
1656000	1658000	Where like Playstation 3
1658000	1660000	And Xbox 360
1660000	1662000	Like the stuff that that renders
1662000	1664000	Really is close to like DVD
1664000	1666000	Blu-ray quality
1666000	1668000	I mean what is left to improve
1668000	1670000	My eye cannot tell the difference
1670000	1672000	That easily between 720p and 1080p
1672000	1674000	How are they going to justify
1674000	1676000	An upgrade to Playstation 4
1676000	1678000	And the other thing too is
1678000	1680000	I mean who knows what technology is going to be like
1680000	1682000	When the Playstation 4 comes out
1682000	1684000	I mean how long did it take for them to develop
1684000	1686000	High definition and 720p
1686000	1688000	And 1080p and so yeah it's only a few years
1688000	1690000	I mean we have no idea
1690000	1692000	What technology is going to be like then
1692000	1694000	This kind of processor I wouldn't be surprised
1694000	1696000	If we see this in a future PC
1696000	1698000	Processor or anything
1698000	1700000	Where you can add
1700000	1702000	Something beyond 4 cores
1702000	1704000	You can just add as many cores as you want
1704000	1706000	I mean granted
1706000	1708000	Chip might be bigger or you have multiple processors
1708000	1710000	In there and stuff but
1710000	1712000	I don't know it's interesting
1712000	1714000	I guess I have to admit
1714000	1716000	You have a pretty good argument there
1716000	1718000	The thing that it will do we haven't thought of yet
1718000	1720000	Or it would already be in the system
1720000	1722000	Or they are just making it to do things
1722000	1724000	That we haven't thought of yet
1724000	1726000	What about and this might be crazy talk
1726000	1728000	But especially with you know
1728000	1730000	Avatar the movie having done so
1730000	1732000	Well
1732000	1734000	At the box office being so well received
1734000	1736000	Especially as the visuals I mean
1736000	1738000	I haven't seen it yet myself and I know I ragged
1738000	1740000	On it but clearly I must have
1740000	1742000	Been wrong because everybody I know has been raving
1742000	1744000	About the movie even if they don't like the story
1744000	1746000	Everybody is pretty consistent with
1746000	1748000	But the visuals wow wow
1748000	1750000	Wowie wow
1750000	1752000	You know is this whole 3D
1752000	1754000	Thing where maybe games are going
1754000	1756000	I actually do want to go see it in IMAX
1756000	1758000	Take me with you
1758000	1760000	Because I'm kind of wanting to see it now
1760000	1762000	Like just so many people
1762000	1764000	Are having such a big boner over it
1764000	1766000	I'm like okay maybe I was wrong
1766000	1768000	I'll go see the damn movie
1768000	1770000	Let's go before I start school
1770000	1772000	I could probably do that so we'll talk off air
1772000	1774000	Anyhow I think I have
1774000	1776000	4 hours available on Thursday
1776000	1778000	This is right? 4 hours?
1778000	1780000	It's a James Cameron movie it's about 4 hours?
1780000	1782000	2 and a half hours
1782000	1784000	I have a free screen for it this week
1784000	1786000	Or this week in 3D but I've already seen it
1786000	1788000	Whoa
1788000	1790000	I'll go
1790000	1792000	Give me your tickets
1792000	1794000	I think it's on Tuesday
1794000	1796000	Actually it is on Thursday
1796000	1798000	Hey that's funny
1798000	1800000	Maysatsuma in chat says
1800000	1802000	The Playstation 4 will give you new eyes
1802000	1804000	To see its new better ultra graphics
1804000	1806000	Dude you might be joking
1806000	1808000	But if we're talking 3D you gotta have those glasses
1808000	1810000	Right? That's new eyes of a source
1810000	1812000	Not really, well yeah
1812000	1814000	You do need the glasses
1814000	1816000	I could see something for
1816000	1818000	Realty where it's just polarized glasses
1818000	1820000	Those things are cheap
1820000	1822000	I'd rather have that than $200 shutter glasses
1824000	1826000	And I guess the old rule of thumb is
1826000	1828000	Gaming has to get closer and closer
1828000	1830000	To the holodeck from Star Trek
1830000	1832000	Is that every system
1832000	1834000	Brings us one step closer to the holodeck
1834000	1836000	And 3D glasses
1836000	1838000	Will be a pretty big step in that direction
1838000	1840000	Until eventually
1840000	1842000	My Playstation 6
1842000	1844000	Is just a room in my house
1844000	1846000	That I walk into and you know computer
1846000	1848000	Activate Final Fantasy
1848000	1850000	Program and I am in the holodeck
1850000	1852000	Basically
1852000	1854000	That's where gaming is headed right?
1854000	1856000	At least that's how I imagined it
1856000	1858000	Well you remember we did have the U-Force
1858000	1860000	The U-Suck
1862000	1864000	The U-Force
1864000	1866000	My friend had one of those
1866000	1868000	It did not work like you would think
1868000	1870000	In the advertisements that's for dang sure
1870000	1872000	I've got one of the ones that came with
1872000	1874000	Oh shoot
1874000	1876000	What was that game that was on
1876000	1878000	Genesis and then on Sega CD
1878000	1880000	The Activator
1880000	1882000	But now I can't remember the game
1882000	1884000	It was a really cool game
1884000	1886000	I will never forget when Loki took the Activator
1886000	1888000	The Para Para Paradise controller
1888000	1890000	No I thought about it
1890000	1892000	Basically I just took it apart
1892000	1894000	No actually I didn't even take it apart
1894000	1896000	I just threw it away
1896000	1898000	Or I don't know what I'd do with that
1898000	1900000	I was going to though
1900000	1902000	Tigerclaw says people will use the holodeck
1902000	1904000	More than just for video games if you know what I mean
1904000	1906000	That's true there is the age old question
1906000	1908000	About any new peripheral or game device
1908000	1910000	Or anything that is released
1910000	1912000	That has to do with a piece of plastic
1912000	1914000	There is the age old question
1914000	1916000	You have to ask
1916000	1918000	Anytime you hear about a new peripheral
1918000	1920000	Anytime you hear about something new being released
1920000	1922000	The question is
1922000	1924000	How long until someone puts their dick in it
1924000	1926000	Not necessarily how long
1926000	1928000	It's basically
1928000	1930000	As I've seen it before
1930000	1932000	It's TTP
1932000	1934000	Is there a website dedicated to this
1934000	1936000	No there isn't
1936000	1938000	It's basically
1938000	1940000	How long will someone create a penis with it
1940000	1942000	Or put their penis in it
1942000	1944000	And install Linux on it
1944000	1946000	That's the other question
1946000	1948000	Or use it in conjunction with their penis
1948000	1950000	That's basically
1950000	1952000	For example
1952000	1954000	The Wii Vitality sensor
1954000	1956000	How long until someone puts a penis into that
1956000	1958000	You know
1958000	1960000	Xbox One is positive
1960000	1962000	LittleBigPlanet
1962000	1964000	How long until someone creates a penis in that
1964000	1966000	That was like milliseconds
1968000	1970000	There is a whole bunch of stuff like that
1970000	1972000	But I mean that is a good point
1972000	1974000	If we get to the holodeck
1974000	1976000	There's going to be guys that never leave the house
1976000	1978000	I mean
1978000	1980000	I hope the holodeck has a holo-bathroom
1980000	1982000	Because people will live there
1982000	1984000	It's going to be strange
1984000	1986000	Anyhow
1986000	1988000	Alright hey
1988000	1990000	Changing tones completely
1990000	1992000	Something else that game devices do these days
1992000	1994000	Is play movies
1994000	1996000	And obviously digital distribution is getting big
1996000	1998000	But some studios might have some second thoughts
1998000	2000000	This week Sony apparently
2000000	2002000	Put the movie Armored
2002000	2004000	Which is a new release that is playing in theaters right now
2004000	2006000	I had not heard of this movie
2006000	2008000	But it looks like the bow-pow
2008000	2010000	Action type of flick that I would not usually see
2010000	2012000	It's Armored
2012000	2014000	Is the movie
2014000	2016000	And it's Matt Dillon
2016000	2018000	And Laurence Fishburne
2018000	2020000	And Jean Renaud
2020000	2022000	And all these people
2022000	2024000	Peter Petrelli is in it though
2024000	2026000	I see him in the poster
2026000	2028000	The movie
2028000	2030000	I don't know how it's doing at the box office
2030000	2032000	I don't think it's in the top ten
2032000	2034000	Because you've got Avatar
2034000	2036000	And the Sherlock Holmes
2036000	2038000	And the freaking chipmunks
2038000	2040000	How did that happen?
2040000	2042000	And all this
2042000	2044000	Well Armored, despite the fact that it's not doing well in theaters
2044000	2046000	Maybe this is not helping the case
2046000	2048000	It was available for download on the Playstation Store this week
2048000	2050000	That's right
2050000	2052000	You could actually download a movie
2052000	2054000	Already in theaters
2054000	2056000	Not just that, it was up for free
2056000	2058000	I call that the internet
2060000	2062000	Well yeah, but usually this type of thing is not like
2062000	2064000	Officially done by Sony
2064000	2066000	And to be honest
2066000	2068000	This really wasn't either
2068000	2070000	It was of course
2070000	2072000	Whoopsie
2072000	2074000	Somebody accidentally put that thing up
2074000	2076000	Long before it should have gone up
2076000	2078000	And put it up for the price of free
2078000	2080000	But what I think is interesting about this
2080000	2082000	I mean, yeah, haha, point and laugh
2082000	2084000	At Sony for whatever happened over this
2084000	2086000	But I find it interesting
2086000	2088000	That this movie was all ready to go
2088000	2090000	I mean, clearly
2090000	2092000	This was the case of somebody pushing the button too early
2092000	2094000	Or pushing the wrong button
2094000	2096000	And causing this movie to go up on the site way early
2096000	2098000	But it was already encoded
2098000	2100000	It was already sitting on a server waiting to be dumped
2100000	2102000	It was just waiting for someone to throw the switch
2102000	2104000	I kind of find it interesting
2104000	2106000	That the movies are at that point
2106000	2108000	Where
2108000	2110000	Nobody's waiting to
2110000	2112000	Deliver the movie to the service
2112000	2114000	And I realize
2114000	2116000	I think this is one of Sony's studios that put the movie out
2116000	2118000	So maybe that's part of the reason
2118000	2120000	But I mean
2120000	2122000	Isn't that kind of weird
2122000	2124000	That it was sitting there on the store waiting to go
2124000	2126000	Like, probably all these movies
2126000	2128000	Are already sitting on the store
2128000	2130000	People knew how to hack in there
2130000	2132000	Keep in mind that
2132000	2134000	And this even goes back to the VHS days
2134000	2136000	Is that there were often
2136000	2138000	Screener copies available for awards ceremonies
2138000	2140000	I actually had a copy of American Pie
2140000	2142000	Not American Pie
2142000	2144000	American Beauty
2144000	2146000	When
2146000	2148000	No, I take that back, I take that back
2148000	2150000	It was Titanic is what I had
2150000	2152000	I had a screening version of Titanic
2152000	2154000	When it had just gotten out of the theater
2154000	2156000	Which was the only way I was going to see it
2156000	2158000	It was for free
2158000	2160000	Yeah, a really good friend of mine who may or may not be sitting in this room
2160000	2162000	Used to get those screener copies all the time
2162000	2164000	No, not those kind of screener copies
2164000	2166000	Not the review screeners
2166000	2168000	The actual
2168000	2170000	For your consideration
2170000	2172000	Oscar screeners
2172000	2174000	They have screen copies of movies
2174000	2176000	Like, literally right, sometimes even before they come out
2176000	2178000	We watch Snakes on a Plane
2178000	2180000	At my work
2180000	2182000	Right before we went to theaters
2182000	2184000	And
2184000	2186000	Yay, but you know
2186000	2188000	I saw that at Disneyland
2188000	2190000	It's done, you know, it can be done
2190000	2192000	Yeah, but I don't think Playstation 3
2192000	2194000	Is being used as a screening service
2194000	2196000	It's kind of interesting if it could be
2196000	2198000	I'm kind of surprised
2198000	2200000	With piracy and everything going on
2200000	2202000	I'm kind of surprised they don't have a device
2202000	2204000	It'll be funny if that copy gets ripped
2204000	2206000	And just, you know, dumped
2206000	2208000	I'm sure it already happened
2208000	2210000	It happened long before you thought of it
2210000	2212000	Here's the thing though
2212000	2214000	I don't care about that movie at all
2214000	2216000	If I saw it for free
2216000	2218000	I'd be like, nope, still don't want to watch it
2218000	2220000	Sorry
2220000	2222000	I have better things to do
2222000	2224000	For an hour and a half
2224000	2226000	Yeah, but still
2226000	2228000	I'm gonna say call like weird on the whole
2228000	2230000	You know, it was up on the marketplace
2230000	2232000	Long before it should have been
2232000	2234000	Right?
2234000	2236000	Yeah
2236000	2238000	That does kind of go without saying
2238000	2240000	Well, I'm sure somebody's gonna get a write-up
2240000	2242000	Over that one
2242000	2244000	We'll see what happens now
2244000	2246000	Someone's probably pissing their pants
2246000	2248000	Probably already fired
2248000	2250000	Well, how about
2250000	2252000	I think this is strange news at all
2252000	2258000	But Final Fantasy 13 sales have actually decreased
2258000	2262000	From how they were during the release
2262000	2264000	It actually
2264000	2266000	I don't see why that's a really big thing
2266000	2268000	Because, I mean
2268000	2270000	Just about when anything comes out
2270000	2272000	Especially something big like that
2272000	2274000	Everyone's gonna be picking up their copy during the first week
2274000	2276000	It had a million plus release day
2276000	2278000	Broke records for the first week
2278000	2280000	And then it
2280000	2282000	Basically dropped
2282000	2284000	About a million units
2284000	2286000	Into the second week
2286000	2288000	It did take a dip
2288000	2290000	Because everyone's already bought it
2290000	2292000	Also, Squeenix
2292000	2294000	Is pretty much like
2294000	2296000	When it gets the worldwide release
2296000	2298000	We're gonna hit our numbers
2298000	2300000	So they're not too worried about it
2300000	2302000	I think another thing, especially with Final Fantasy 13
2302000	2304000	Dude, they released it the week before Christmas
2304000	2306000	So of course the second week
2306000	2308000	I mean, I don't know how big
2308000	2310000	Of a holiday Christmas is in Japan
2310000	2312000	Compared to here, I'm imagining it's not quite the same
2312000	2314000	Big deal and same shopping patterns
2314000	2316000	That we have here
2316000	2318000	But, you know, still
2318000	2320000	That's gotta have some impact
2320000	2322000	You don't really have the amount of holiday purchasing
2322000	2324000	Going on in the second week
2324000	2326000	When you release your game the week before
2326000	2328000	A big holiday, right?
2328000	2330000	I'm sure that's a part of it too
2330000	2332000	But I kinda get where this is going
2332000	2334000	They talk about this in movies a lot
2334000	2336000	And the late drop off can usually tell you
2336000	2338000	Like the longevity of a movie
2338000	2340000	Sometimes you have these sequels that come out
2340000	2342000	And they drop off huge in the second week
2342000	2344000	And that means the movie's probably not gonna do very well
2344000	2346000	Even if it had a good weekend
2346000	2348000	But other movies like, well, Avatar
2348000	2350000	For example
2350000	2352000	Is not showing a lot of signs of slowing down
2352000	2354000	I don't think it's gonna have the longevity of a movie
2354000	2356000	Like Titanic
2356000	2358000	But it's been dropping off very slowly
2358000	2360000	In its first few weeks of release
2360000	2362000	And doesn't look like it's gonna slow down
2362000	2364000	The Oscar season gets rip roaring
2364000	2366000	So, you know, I think
2366000	2368000	A lot of game companies like to see that happen
2368000	2370000	With a game
2370000	2372000	But yeah, Final Fantasy, you sort of expect this is gonna happen
2372000	2374000	Most Final Fantasy fanboys and girls are pretty rabid
2374000	2376000	They go out and buy it the first day
2376000	2378000	And, you know, you're not gonna see the same
2378000	2380000	Type of sales the second and third week
2380000	2382000	I think the same thing's gonna happen here in the US
2382000	2384000	And in Europe
2384000	2386000	Huge first week sales, huge drop off second week
2386000	2388000	90% drop off second week
2388000	2390000	And unfortunately they're just not releasing it
2390000	2392000	In a time like Christmas
2392000	2394000	Where it's gonna sell consistently
2394000	2396000	You know, March is kind of a weird month
2396000	2398000	They should have already had it ready
2398000	2400000	Well, we'll see
2400000	2402000	Alright, so other things
2402000	2404000	You know
2404000	2406000	Might cause the drop off of Final Fantasy 13
2406000	2408000	Would be
2408000	2410000	Wiiwa
2410000	2412000	Okay, well maybe not
2412000	2414000	But, um
2414000	2416000	Wiiwa is this thing
2416000	2418000	I think I talked about on the show before
2418000	2420000	Where I got my Cage Match song
2420000	2422000	D-A-N-C-E
2422000	2424000	From
2424000	2426000	At least the idea for it
2426000	2428000	Basically, Wiiwa is a brand new game that's coming out
2428000	2430000	And
2430000	2432000	It's using a unique
2432000	2434000	Kind of a
2434000	2436000	Controller attachment
2436000	2438000	Basically it's this big stuffed animal
2438000	2440000	I guess it would be a Wiiwa
2440000	2442000	That you shove the remote into
2442000	2444000	And you kind of
2444000	2446000	Walk it around and jump
2446000	2448000	And do all sorts of weird stuff with it
2448000	2450000	To control the character in game
2450000	2452000	It's like a
2452000	2454000	Muppet, basically, you have your own Muppet
2454000	2456000	Something like that, yeah
2456000	2458000	You shove your Wiimote up its ass
2458000	2460000	And you can make it dance and sing
2460000	2462000	So, um
2462000	2464000	It looks neat
2464000	2466000	I guess, I don't know
2466000	2468000	What kind of game is it?
2468000	2470000	Is it a Pet Sim game? Is it like an action game?
2470000	2472000	No, it's like an action game
2472000	2474000	It's like something you'd see from Rare or something even
2474000	2476000	Just kind of a little
2476000	2478000	Platformer game where you walk around and you sneak up
2478000	2480000	On enemies and stuff like that
2480000	2482000	They have little mini games in there
2482000	2484000	Including one that I guess the Wiiwa has these
2484000	2486000	Bungee cord things on it
2486000	2488000	Where you can fling it into the air
2488000	2490000	And you kind of do that
2490000	2492000	Almost like a spring
2492000	2494000	I'm pulling up a little video here in studio
2494000	2496000	Courtesy of our chat room
2500000	2502000	Wow
2502000	2504000	I just crashed the Bandicoot
2504000	2506000	Oh, you put the Wiimote in its mouth
2506000	2508000	So you force feed it
2508000	2510000	Okay
2510000	2512000	Oh, so you have to like
2512000	2514000	Shake the thing around
2514000	2516000	That's kind of cute
2516000	2518000	Back and forth and stuff
2518000	2520000	That's adorable
2520000	2522000	It is kind of cute, like I noticed that
2522000	2524000	It's not aimed at adults
2524000	2526000	They have a little six year old kid
2526000	2528000	In the video
2528000	2530000	You're sneaking up and then
2530000	2532000	You've got to duck down
2532000	2534000	That's cute
2534000	2536000	I would totally play this
2536000	2538000	He's got a little play cord thing
2538000	2540000	That's great
2540000	2542000	You know what though
2542000	2544000	I'm a little worried
2544000	2546000	Doesn't this seem like the type of thing that probably works way better
2546000	2548000	In the preview than it does in real life
2548000	2550000	Like you're probably throwing this guy around
2550000	2552000	And it's just like fucking move the way I want you to
2552000	2554000	Yeah, but if they've got a kid doing it
2554000	2556000	Well, come on
2556000	2558000	This is all cut and paste
2558000	2560000	He's not actually playing the game
2560000	2562000	I want to actually see
2562000	2564000	A practical demo of this
2564000	2566000	So
2566000	2568000	Interesting
2568000	2570000	Although I will point out
2570000	2572000	That little stuffed animal has a hole in its mouth
2572000	2574000	Time to penis, 15 seconds
2576000	2578000	Just saying
2578000	2580000	It's a new peripheral
2580000	2582000	It has to be measured, no pun intended
2582000	2584000	That's true
2584000	2586000	Speaking of
2586000	2588000	Speaking of adorable and cute games
2588000	2590000	Although this one I don't think Jamie plays quite as much
2590000	2592000	Maybe she should though
2592000	2594000	And if she wants to know where to begin
2594000	2596000	LittleBigPlanet has done the first annual
2596000	2598000	SAKI awards
2598000	2600000	Or that they're calling them the Sakademy awards
2600000	2602000	I think that's a really cute little pun there
2602000	2604000	The Sakademy awards
2604000	2606000	Media Molecule has been giving out all these types of awards
2606000	2610000	Did you know there's 1.5 million LittleBigPlanet levels right now
2610000	2612000	Holy crap
2612000	2614000	That's a lot
2614000	2616000	Like stupid levels
2616000	2618000	Probably 1.49 million
2618000	2620000	Really bad levels
2620000	2622000	That's still a lot though if you have 100,000 good levels
2622000	2624000	That's true
2624000	2626000	Some of the awards that they gave out
2626000	2628000	Best Mashima video
2628000	2630000	Best visuals and use of special effects
2630000	2632000	Best use of story in a level
2632000	2634000	And all more
2634000	2636000	The best visuals one was pretty awesome
2636000	2638000	It was a post-apocalyptic
2638000	2640000	I think was the name of it
2640000	2642000	And it actually had really good lighting
2642000	2644000	And explosion effects in there which is pretty awesome
2644000	2646000	I saw one where the Sakboy would step on a switch
2646000	2648000	And then this piano just started to play Beethoven
2648000	2652000	And it wasn't even one of those musical levels
2652000	2654000	Where you hang on to the vehicle and it plays a song
2654000	2656000	As you run through the level
2656000	2658000	But no, an actual piano came down
2658000	2660000	And little feet would dance on the keys and play Beethoven
2660000	2662000	I was like, good god this game is crazy
2662000	2664000	In a good way
2664000	2666000	The things people do with it is insane
2666000	2668000	But here's
2668000	2670000	Here's what LittleBigPlanet needs
2670000	2672000	One thing I think is missing right now
2672000	2674000	Is that if you go in to play custom levels
2674000	2676000	I think the interface right now for playing custom levels
2676000	2678000	Is still a little eh
2678000	2680000	What they need to do is take these award winners
2680000	2684000	And put them on a separate planet or something
2684000	2686000	Or put them in a separate menu
2686000	2688000	Something where I can go straight to the best
2688000	2692000	Where I can weed through all the crap that's out there
2692000	2694000	And just go straight to these levels I have to see
2694000	2698000	I wonder if they had a category for best trophy whoring level
2698000	2700000	Because remember when the game first came out
2700000	2702000	All the high rated levels were like
2702000	2704000	Earn seven trophies in thirty seconds
2704000	2706000	Exclamation exclamation one one one
2706000	2708000	I was looking at some of the other ones on there
2708000	2710000	Of course the Contra one
2710000	2712000	One for best collaboration which is awesome
2712000	2714000	All the Contra levels
2714000	2716000	As it should have
2716000	2718000	There was
2718000	2720000	Best
2720000	2722000	Logic device or something like that
2722000	2724000	Or computer
2724000	2726000	And it was the LittleBigPlanet calculator
2726000	2728000	LittleBigPlanet calculator because that was really
2728000	2730000	Really involved
2730000	2732000	There was
2732000	2734000	I'm trying to think what some of the other ones were
2734000	2736000	There was like a best community project
2736000	2738000	I didn't understand what that was
2738000	2740000	I think it was just like tools
2740000	2742000	They had logic tools that you could use for your
2742000	2744000	Your machines and stuff
2744000	2746000	But yeah definitely check out
2746000	2748000	The post apocalyptic level because that looked pretty
2748000	2750000	Our good friend Bobby
2750000	2752000	Is in chat and says
2752000	2754000	They might be in the news section Sky
2754000	2756000	I forgot LittleBigPlanet had a news section but that's a good point
2756000	2758000	Although I wonder if it will link directly to the levels
2758000	2760000	I mean I'm sure it says something about the awards
2760000	2762000	In the news section but I wonder if it
2762000	2764000	Would link directly to the levels I don't know
2764000	2766000	At the same time when I have been
2766000	2768000	Playing LittleBigPlanet recently I've been checking out
2768000	2770000	Those new Pirates of the Caribbean levels so
2770000	2772000	I haven't had time to check out this academy winners
2772000	2774000	How'd you like those?
2774000	2776000	It was cute I didn't play a whole lot
2776000	2778000	So I can't really give you a full review yet but
2778000	2780000	I was kind of surprised that you
2780000	2782000	Can't stay under water very long
2782000	2784000	There's a lot of things later that increase your breathing time
2784000	2786000	And things I haven't gotten to yet
2786000	2788000	You can get scuba gear that
2788000	2790000	Allows you to breathe under water
2790000	2792000	Forever
2792000	2794000	So you can get that
2794000	2796000	I figured that was there yeah
2796000	2798000	I did like how the water can raise and lower
2798000	2800000	There was one part of the very first level
2800000	2802000	Where you can flood the town
2802000	2804000	And then you bring the flood down
2804000	2806000	It was kind of neat
2806000	2808000	I do
2808000	2810000	I just love the fact that LittleBigPlanet
2810000	2812000	Is still being supported
2812000	2814000	And that they haven't taken that route
2814000	2816000	That I think some developers would have and put all this
2816000	2818000	In LittleBigPlanet 2
2818000	2820000	They've really been supporting this one game
2820000	2822000	You know it's
2822000	2824000	A really good Playstation 3 value I gotta say
2824000	2826000	I've colored me impressed
2826000	2828000	You know I named it my game of the year
2828000	2830000	Last year and I still stand by it
2830000	2832000	I think that's one of the greatest games
2832000	2834000	They've released in quite some time
2834000	2836000	But
2836000	2838000	Maybe I'm just biased I don't know
2838000	2840000	Anyhow moving on with more news and we'll get to release dates
2840000	2842000	DarkSakura what do you got for us?
2842000	2844000	I have some news about
2844000	2846000	Sonic Racing
2846000	2848000	For 360
2848000	2850000	Not Sonic R just to clarify
2850000	2852000	But there's actually going to be
2852000	2854000	Characters that you can use
2854000	2856000	For Sonic Racing namely your avatars
2856000	2858000	Will be playable and
2858000	2860000	Banjo Kazooie
2860000	2862000	While I really don't give a crap about Banjo
2862000	2864000	I actually think it would be pretty cool to go ahead
2864000	2866000	And use my
2866000	2868000	My avatar and the other
2868000	2870000	Characters in the game too are
2870000	2872000	Of course Sonic Tails, Shadow
2872000	2874000	I from Super Monkey Ball
2874000	2876000	Samba
2876000	2878000	Samba de Amigo Monkey
2878000	2880000	Beat from Jet Set Radio
2880000	2882000	Alex Kidd, Billy Hatcher
2882000	2884000	Whoa whoa whoa
2884000	2886000	Sega is acknowledging Jet Set Radio?
2886000	2888000	Yes
2888000	2890000	That's good right?
2890000	2892000	Alex Kidd
2892000	2894000	Oh wow when was the last time we had an Alex Kidd game?
2894000	2896000	Billy Hatcher
2896000	2898000	And Ryo Hazuki
2898000	2900000	The guy from Shenmue
2900000	2902000	Wow it's like Sega is like
2902000	2904000	Throwing bones at all these like
2904000	2906000	Fan like dammit we need
2906000	2908000	A new Jet Set Future, Jet Set Radio
2908000	2910000	Dammit we need a new Shenmue and now they're like
2910000	2912000	They're teasing us with this silly little
2912000	2914000	Racing game
2914000	2916000	Well you remember when they teased us with having knights
2916000	2918000	In that stupid
2918000	2920000	Eye Toy game
2920000	2922000	Oh yeah knights in the game?
2922000	2924000	But they said that there's
2924000	2926000	Rumors though that other possibilities is
2926000	2928000	Ulala and
2928000	2930000	Akira from
2930000	2932000	Virtua Fighter and Vice from Skies of Arcadia
2932000	2934000	Now they're just being mean
2934000	2936000	Like we all know there's not gonna be
2936000	2938000	Another Space Channel 5 game so
2938000	2940000	There could be
2940000	2942000	Space Channel 5
2942000	2944000	I really wish there would be but like
2944000	2946000	They're just being mean by putting Ulala in the game
2946000	2948000	Like that's just rude
2948000	2950000	Space Michaels in the game
2950000	2952000	If they put Pudding Da in there
2952000	2954000	I'm gonna scream
2954000	2956000	Cause she was my favorite
2956000	2958000	She was my favorite
2958000	2960000	For me, sorry, it was Jaguar
2960000	2962000	Cause we come with TAAAAA
2962000	2964000	With this little group
2964000	2966000	Please please please if you've never heard of Space Channel 5
2966000	2968000	You really owe it to yourself to go look at the videos on YouTube
2968000	2970000	Or try to find a copy if you can
2970000	2972000	On Dreamcast or Playstation 2
2972000	2974000	They had the collection
2974000	2976000	Oh man I love that game
2976000	2978000	I really wish they'd bring that back
2978000	2980000	Because I cannot believe
2980000	2982000	And I'm hanging my head in shame
2982000	2984000	As I'm even talking about this
2984000	2986000	I bought stupid Barbie crap
2986000	2988000	For my avatar cause I'm ridiculous
2988000	2990000	But it was
2990000	2992000	Why are you sighing at me Loki?
2992000	2994000	Don't judge me
2994000	2996000	Stop judging me
2996000	2998000	Why?
2998000	3000000	Why bother
3000000	3002000	Buying stuff for your avatar?
3002000	3004000	Because it was really funny
3004000	3006000	It made me laugh cause it's in the band hero section
3006000	3008000	There's a microphone
3008000	3010000	And it has a giant purple ribbon
3010000	3012000	Like the kind some 16 year old
3012000	3014000	Girl would have
3014000	3016000	In her band
3016000	3018000	I think it was the Taylor Swift microphone
3018000	3020000	I bought that cause
3020000	3022000	I liked karaoke and all that stuff
3022000	3024000	It was really funny and it made me laugh
3024000	3026000	When my avatar was dancing with it
3026000	3028000	But then I was thinking
3028000	3030000	If I'm playing this racing game or whatever
3030000	3032000	You're not gonna see that microphone shoved in the back of the car
3032000	3034000	Boo
3034000	3036000	It would be funny
3036000	3038000	Remember that racing game that they had out
3038000	3040000	That was free to download and then they have all those
3040000	3042000	Expansions you have to buy and stuff to it
3042000	3044000	On 360?
3044000	3046000	Well keep in mind I've been asleep for the past 5 months
3046000	3048000	On 360 so no
3048000	3050000	Oh did it?
3050000	3052000	I think
3052000	3054000	I don't know
3054000	3056000	Honestly because
3056000	3058000	No I don't know if it came out because I would have downloaded it
3058000	3060000	Cause it would have been free
3060000	3062000	I don't know
3062000	3064000	How behind I am
3064000	3066000	I just finally downloaded my
3066000	3068000	Copy of
3068000	3070000	Madballs
3070000	3072000	Nice
3072000	3074000	I've had the code for it forever
3074000	3076000	Oh yeah I should probably download that
3076000	3078000	Oh yeah well come on here I am on the show
3078000	3080000	Going hey guys
3080000	3082000	Shadow Complex wow what a great game
3082000	3084000	Most people are like yeah didn't you get the memo like 6 months ago
3084000	3086000	So many games
3086000	3088000	So little time keep in mind
3088000	3090000	We all have day jobs
3090000	3092000	Your game sites you like to go surf and all that
3092000	3094000	They get paid to play games 8 hours a day
3094000	3096000	And all that we don't do that
3096000	3098000	We have to work in our free time so
3098000	3100000	Sometimes we can't play everything
3100000	3102000	And by the way chat there's a lot of folks in chat saying
3102000	3104000	Like Misty says
3104000	3106000	Barbie crap I bought a cell phone and I got the
3106000	3108000	Free chocobo I waste enough money
3108000	3110000	On rock band download content
3110000	3112000	Act Def said I would have expected Disney stuff
3112000	3114000	But Barbie come on Rob I wasn't being literal
3114000	3116000	It wasn't literally Barbie
3116000	3118000	But I call it that because
3118000	3120000	I mean it's basically the same thing it's like a dress your Barbie doll
3120000	3122000	And there's no
3122000	3124000	I did pay for avatar content
3124000	3126000	Did I tell you? What'd you buy?
3126000	3128000	I got one of the steampunk outfits
3128000	3130000	I actually have left over points
3130000	3132000	Do you have one of those ginormous helmets or something?
3132000	3134000	No I got like the duster jacket with the
3134000	3136000	Kinda gypsy top
3136000	3138000	But I'm actually planning on
3138000	3140000	Getting the rest of the steampunk set
3140000	3142000	Because I actually I don't really buy much with my points
3142000	3144000	Dan usually puts all the points on his account
3144000	3146000	And buys this stuff for us
3146000	3148000	So I was gonna go ahead and get
3148000	3150000	The rest of the steampunk outfit because I think
3150000	3152000	The stuff's cute
3152000	3154000	I have sim stuff what's the difference?
3154000	3156000	One of the games I didn't mention
3156000	3158000	During my gaming week but I did play for a little while
3158000	3160000	Was One vs. 100 and I was actually cracking up
3160000	3162000	Because you know sometimes it'll show these random
3162000	3164000	People in the mob who get questions right
3164000	3166000	Or wrong and like it cracks
3166000	3168000	My shit up when like I see this person wearing
3168000	3170000	Just like a t-shirt and jeans but they
3170000	3172000	Have one of those like uber robot helmets
3172000	3174000	On their avatar and it's like
3174000	3176000	That looks hideous like
3176000	3182000	And 45,000 people just saw how stupid your avatar looks like
3182000	3184000	And they couldn't be happier
3184000	3186000	Then again I have a princess microphone
3186000	3188000	So who am I to judge?
3188000	3190000	Who am I to judge?
3190000	3192000	At least you didn't buy a fake cat
3192000	3194000	I didn't buy a fake cat
3194000	3196000	Alright let's travel the world and look at some release dates
3196000	3198000	If there are any
3198000	3200000	This week actually there's some pretty decent stuff coming out
3200000	3202000	On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
3202000	3204000	We have Darksiders from THQ
3204000	3206000	Will be making its way out this week
3206000	3208000	Also Fable 2 is getting a
3208000	3210000	Platinum Hits version
3210000	3212000	Coming out this week
3212000	3214000	With the download content of course
3214000	3216000	For 30 bucks
3216000	3218000	Newer games though, Bayonetta finally making its way out
3218000	3222000	On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week
3222000	3224000	So definitely worth picking that one up
3224000	3226000	Fast Food Panic on the Nintendo DS
3226000	3228000	Making its way out
3228000	3230000	And
3230000	3232000	Not really gaming related
3232000	3234000	But the Guinness Book of World Records
3234000	3236000	Gamer's Edition
3236000	3238000	Is making its way out to book stands as well
3238000	3240000	And you should at least
3240000	3242000	Thump through it but I don't know if you should
3242000	3244000	Pay them for it you know
3244000	3246000	Unless your coffee table is empty and you need some
3246000	3248000	Or honestly the top of your toilet
3248000	3250000	Is needed some new material who knows
3250000	3252000	Trust me for 15 bucks
3252000	3254000	You can find some better magazines for that
3254000	3256000	Hell that's a few playboys or penthouses
3256000	3258000	Geez
3258000	3260000	If you're looking for more toilet
3260000	3262000	Stuff you know I'm seriously
3262000	3264000	Better than the Guinness Book
3264000	3266000	Do we really need to see
3266000	3268000	Oh hey look Batman Arkham Asylum
3268000	3270000	Was the greatest game ever
3270000	3272000	Guinness says it must be true
3272000	3274000	Or do you want to see some tits
3274000	3276000	Or do you want to see some badge
3278000	3280000	I just want to point out
3280000	3282000	Some of our listeners are like 16, 17
3282000	3284000	If you realize this right
3284000	3286000	Welcome to adulthood
3286000	3288000	Don't you know you're supposed to say twat
3288000	3290000	And seriously
3290000	3292000	They know as well as I do
3292000	3294000	That the Guinness Book of World Records
3294000	3296000	Gamer's Edition is crap okay
3296000	3298000	I only looked at it one time
3298000	3300000	The 2009 or 2008
3300000	3302000	Who cares they all suck
3302000	3304000	Because I was killing time while my wife looked for books
3304000	3306000	And I was just like
3306000	3308000	Okay I've read this magazine read this magazine
3308000	3310000	Hey Gamer's Edition let's see this is crap
3310000	3312000	That's it for releases
3312000	3314000	Unfortunately
3314000	3316000	You only have those magazines for the articles
3316000	3318000	Of course right
3318000	3320000	Actually the articles are really boring
3320000	3322000	Some of the forums are funny
3322000	3324000	But the articles suck
3324000	3326000	Alright moving on
3326000	3328000	Let's look at Japanese release dates
3328000	3330000	How we go from that to Japanese release dates
3330000	3332000	I have no idea but we do
3332000	3334000	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan
3334000	3336000	James Cameron's Avatar the game
3336000	3338000	Gets it's Japanese localization
3338000	3340000	From Ubisoft this week
3340000	3342000	On the 7th of January
3342000	3344000	That's when the games are coming out
3344000	3346000	That is also making it's way to the Playstation 3
3346000	3348000	Just so you know
3348000	3350000	Also I want to point out
3350000	3352000	Speaking of Batman Arkham Asylum
3352000	3354000	That is finally making it's way to Japan next week
3354000	3356000	It will not be on the 7th
3356000	3358000	But it will be on the 14th
3358000	3360000	So you'll probably hear me say it again next week
3360000	3362000	The Wii is empty this week
3362000	3364000	There's really not a lot to look forward to there
3364000	3366000	So is the Playstation 2
3366000	3368000	On the PSP
3368000	3370000	You got Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep
3370000	3372000	And I think that's pretty much your other
3372000	3374000	Big big big game this week
3374000	3376000	Did you see the trailer for that?
3376000	3378000	I have seen little bits and pieces
3378000	3380000	If you go to the website for it
3380000	3382000	The trailer is freaking amazing
3382000	3384000	Then put it on the console
3384000	3386000	This is my biggest bitch about these
3386000	3388000	Portable games
3388000	3390000	Did you hear
3390000	3392000	Earlier this week
3392000	3394000	On the DSI
3394000	3396000	Like
3396000	3398000	Old school Apple 2E or this new shit
3398000	3400000	This new shit
3400000	3402000	Pass
3402000	3404000	I'm like you don't have direction
3404000	3406000	Keys on the
3406000	3408000	DS in order to
3408000	3410000	Shoot
3410000	3412000	I bet in these new games do you shoot
3412000	3414000	Like 5 Buffalo and then like congratulations
3414000	3416000	You shot 3400 pounds of food
3416000	3418000	Unfortunately you can only carry 100
3418000	3420000	Back to the wagon
3420000	3422000	I somehow doubt it
3422000	3424000	I remember that
3424000	3426000	Good times
3426000	3428000	I was gonna say there's actually
3428000	3430000	Another Oregon Trail game that I linked
3430000	3432000	In our show roll
3432000	3434000	You have to see it's Oregon Trail of Physics
3434000	3436000	It's awesome
3436000	3438000	The Oregon Trail of Physics?
3438000	3440000	No, Oregon Trail with Physics
3440000	3442000	What is this? Did it not make the show roll tonight?
3442000	3444000	Then tell us about it
3444000	3446000	It's this game, it's not even really called the Oregon Trail
3446000	3448000	But it is exactly the Oregon Trail
3448000	3450000	It's basically
3450000	3452000	The Oregon Trail
3452000	3454000	You stuff your cart full of crap
3454000	3456000	Whatever you're carrying with you
3456000	3458000	And you take
3458000	3460000	It's like combining the Oregon Trail with
3460000	3462000	That sledding game
3462000	3464000	I don't remember what it was
3464000	3466000	You like jump hills
3466000	3468000	You're oxed
3468000	3470000	Just start running down the hill and then
3470000	3472000	You go off of it and fly and stuff
3472000	3474000	And if you land upside down like people get injured
3474000	3476000	Stuff like that
3476000	3478000	I've seen a Flash game like that
3478000	3480000	Somebody skinned that with the Oregon Trail basically
3480000	3482000	Yeah, it's
3482000	3484000	What was it called here?
3484000	3486000	It is
3486000	3488000	Let's go find El Dorado
3488000	3490000	How do you die of dysentery in the game?
3490000	3492000	Is that possible?
3492000	3494000	There's a video of it
3494000	3496000	Is it a Flash game?
3496000	3498000	It might be a Flash game
3498000	3500000	I don't know
3500000	3502000	I'm gonna look into this while Dark Sakura
3502000	3504000	Covers the UK releases
3504000	3506000	You know, it's funny
3506000	3508000	I was just saying
3508000	3510000	What was it called? The Road to El Dorado?
3510000	3512000	I was just watching the Mysterious Cities of Gold last night
3512000	3514000	So I thought that was funny
3514000	3516000	Hello Random!
3516000	3518000	It is Random!
3518000	3520000	It's on Hulu now, Rob
3520000	3522000	The Mysterious Cities of Gold
3522000	3524000	They have all this crazy stuff on Hulu
3524000	3526000	Oh my god, look, he's showing me a picture
3526000	3528000	Hahahahaha
3528000	3530000	Let me see
3530000	3532000	Oh, this is terrible radio
3532000	3534000	I want to see if we have sound effects that I can play
3534000	3536000	Geez
3536000	3538000	Ok, well how about UK releases?
3538000	3540000	Which are, um, yeah, two
3540000	3542000	There's Bayonetta
3542000	3544000	And Darksiders
3544000	3546000	And that's it
3546000	3548000	Happy New Year!
3548000	3550000	No surprise, though, that it's pretty smart
3550000	3552000	Bayonetta!
3552000	3554000	Although, yeah, Bayonetta's a big, big release
3554000	3556000	Can't believe they didn't try to crank that out in time for Christmas
3556000	3558000	Especially because it did get its release over there
3558000	3560000	In Japan
3560000	3562000	Maybe they're just hoping for big sales off of gift cards
3562000	3564000	I don't know
3564000	3566000	I don't know
3566000	3568000	What?
3568000	3570000	I know, I'm very excited about this game
3570000	3572000	Oh, here's a little YouTube, let me see if this
3572000	3574000	I don't know if this has sound effects or anything
3574000	3576000	But this is the Oregon Trail
3580000	3582000	It's like a little frog croaking or something
3582000	3584000	What the hell is that?
3584000	3586000	It's upside down
3586000	3588000	Did it just fart?
3588000	3590000	People do get dysentery in that
3590000	3592000	This game looks amazing
3592000	3594000	I guess it's more like Excite
3594000	3596000	Excite, um, bike with
3596000	3598000	the Oregon Trail
3598000	3600000	Somebody has typhoid right now
3600000	3602000	It's like extra physics physics
3602000	3604000	Where is this game available at?
3604000	3606000	I want it totally
3606000	3608000	Ludum Dare dot com
3608000	3610000	L-U-D-U-M-D-A-R-E dot com
3610000	3612000	You should post that in chat, Rob
3612000	3614000	I will do that right now
3614000	3616000	Good!
3616000	3618000	I'm excited that you're doing that, Rob
3618000	3620000	Just while I'm posting that in chat
3620000	3622000	Uh, Loki
3622000	3624000	Okay
3624000	3626000	Um, let's see
3626000	3628000	I got so distracted by
3628000	3630000	Oregon Trail-ish games
3630000	3632000	Um, anyways
3632000	3634000	So, some more fun stuff
3634000	3636000	Uh, Google, they have
3636000	3638000	Uh, patented
3638000	3640000	Something that's actually
3640000	3642000	Hinting to possible gaming
3642000	3644000	Uh, coming to
3644000	3646000	YouTube, well
3646000	3648000	I mean, I guess it kind of makes sense if you think about it
3648000	3650000	Um, they
3650000	3652000	Were saying that there's already
3652000	3654000	Some kind of interactive games on
3654000	3656000	YouTube, uh, kind of done with
3656000	3658000	Videos, sort of like your choose your own
3658000	3660000	Adventure type stuff
3660000	3662000	But they were saying that the patent titled
3662000	3664000	Web-based system for general
3664000	3666000	General, what was it, um
3666000	3668000	Generation of interactive games based on
3668000	3670000	Digital videos
3670000	3672000	Um, was filed
3672000	3674000	Earlier this year, or I guess last year
3674000	3676000	And it was
3676000	3678000	Um
3678000	3680000	They didn't really see what exactly it's
3680000	3682000	Gonna be, but it sounds like
3682000	3684000	Something that, um
3684000	3686000	Links videos together, creating different
3686000	3688000	Narratives and alternatives, and different scenarios
3688000	3689000	For the users, so
3689000	3691000	So, Mark, you mark create your own video?
3691000	3693000	Something, probably something
3693000	3695000	So that you can create your own, kind of choose
3695000	3697000	Your own adventure stuff, although I wouldn't be
3697000	3699000	Surprised if they did add like casual games
3699000	3701000	To YouTube or something like that
3701000	3703000	Or you could just play like little flash games
3703000	3705000	I mean, that would fit right in I would think
3705000	3707000	I don't know
3707000	3709000	You know what this reminds me of is how on YouTube
3709000	3711000	Like you sometimes see these YouTube things, it's like
3711000	3713000	I want to say there's some channel
3713000	3715000	Where it's like, play rock paper
3715000	3717000	Scissors with me, and you click on the little
3717000	3719000	Links to go to other YouTubes
3719000	3721000	Like, you know, you pick whatever
3721000	3723000	And then you see if you win or not
3723000	3725000	Really stupid stuff, so they've patented
3725000	3727000	That now? Apparently
3727000	3729000	Weird, I wonder if they're planning on like
3729000	3731000	Making a game out of it, or what
3731000	3733000	What they're gonna do
3733000	3735000	YouTube the game
3735000	3737000	I don't know how I feel about that
3737000	3739000	I have to be honest, it's a little strange to me
3739000	3741000	But whatever
3741000	3743000	Does it make you feel dirty inside, Rob?
3743000	3745000	No, it just is weird
3745000	3747000	I really don't have a lot else to add to it
3747000	3749000	But that, it's just weird
3749000	3751000	Alright, what's not as weird
3751000	3753000	Because, you know, there's a lot of folks that are really
3753000	3755000	Into classic games and respecting the classics
3755000	3757000	And so forth
3757000	3759000	There is a project going on at the Atari Museum
3759000	3761000	Where they're actually reconstructing
3761000	3763000	A lot of the old proprietary
3763000	3765000	Chips, things from the 2600
3765000	3767000	And the VCS, also known as
3767000	3769000	The Atari 5200
3769000	3771000	And Atari's old 8-bit computers
3771000	3773000	They're actually using data that was recovered
3773000	3775000	From old tapes
3775000	3777000	Used in the original manufacturing
3777000	3779000	The Atari Museum's
3779000	3781000	Kurt Vendell has noted that
3781000	3783000	The project has a practical application
3783000	3785000	Besides just, you know, it being history
3785000	3787000	What's the potential of this?
3787000	3789000	Having the chips in smaller SMT packaging
3789000	3791000	And potentially bringing back to life
3791000	3793000	Some of the later CMOS designs of combo chips
3793000	3795000	Which could lead to a
3795000	3797000	SOC, or system on a chip
3797000	3799000	The future just got a little brighter
3799000	3801000	In terms of preserving and continuing the legacy
3801000	3803000	Of Atari's custom IC chips
3803000	3805000	But I kind of go, well
3805000	3807000	I think of the flashback and stuff
3807000	3809000	But of course that's more of a console
3809000	3811000	So they're talking about just the whole dang thing
3811000	3813000	Right there on a chip
3813000	3815000	Yeah, I mean, it's like
3815000	3817000	Those flashback consoles, like for example
3817000	3819000	Though you'll see a lot of
3819000	3821000	Nintendos on a chip
3821000	3823000	I mean, it's probably not one chip
3823000	3825000	But it's a few chips, but really shrunken down
3825000	3827000	Like those little knock-off
3827000	3829000	Nintendo systems and stuff
3829000	3831000	That they sell at the mall
3831000	3833000	That Nintendo gets pissed at
3833000	3835000	Or the flea market
3835000	3837000	Tons and tons of those things
3837000	3839000	Oh yeah, those are great for turning them into
3839000	3841000	Little portable or arcade
3841000	3843000	Systems and stuff
3843000	3845000	But you know
3845000	3847000	I'm all for, of course, the
3847000	3849000	Preservation and stuff
3849000	3851000	I really get a kick out of when they
3851000	3853000	Have this, you know, they used to have it at E3 some time ago
3853000	3855000	And even when I went to
3855000	3857000	Classic Gaming Expo once a few years ago
3857000	3859000	Just getting a look at all the old
3859000	3861000	Shit, and just seeing how games
3861000	3863000	Got to where they are now
3863000	3865000	Or, you know, when you start to get in your 30s and all that stuff
3865000	3867000	You start to go, I remember when that was out
3867000	3869000	I remember when that was out, I remember playing that
3869000	3871000	I'm sure it's
3871000	3873000	Worse for others than it was for me
3873000	3875000	But boy, going to one of those made me feel
3875000	3877000	Very old
3877000	3879000	But I'm glad that that stuff
3879000	3881000	Will be preserved and hopefully made more
3881000	3883000	Portable to future generations
3883000	3885000	Speaking of classics
3885000	3887000	We always like to take a moment to
3887000	3889000	Pay some tribute to classic games
3889000	3891000	When Dark Soccer takes
3891000	3893000	A trip into the vault every week and pulls out
3893000	3895000	A game that she says, you know what, folks?
3895000	3897000	You should be playing this game
3897000	3899000	Or you should check out this game, maybe you didn't know about it before
3899000	3901000	But it's our classic video game of the week
3901000	3903000	And it's preserved in our Orange Lounge Radio Museum
3903000	3905000	Forever
3905000	3907000	Forever and ever
3907000	3909000	Which we call the Wiki
3909000	3911000	So Dark Soccer, what game are you lavishing
3911000	3913000	Praise upon this week?
3913000	3915000	First of all, the wrong link
3915000	3917000	Let me actually find the right link again
3917000	3919000	Uh oh
3919000	3921000	Yeah, because this isn't the link that I posted in the thing
3921000	3923000	Might have just broke on its way or something
3923000	3929000	So, don't know what to tell you there
3929000	3931000	Okay, there we go
3931000	3933000	Um, the game is
3933000	3935000	Chōjiki yōsai
3935000	3937000	Macross oboete imasu ka?
3937000	3941000	Which is, Macross, do you remember love?
3941000	3943000	Which, of course, we know there was
3943000	3945000	An anime movie
3945000	3947000	And actually, let's listen to the music for a second
3947000	3951000	You know the music?
3951000	3953000	That was the scrambled music
3953000	3955000	From the actual Macross movies
3957000	3959000	Explosions!
3959000	3961000	Sorry, speakers
3961000	3963000	It's a shooter based off of the
3963000	3965000	Macross anime
3965000	3967000	And this one actually has to do
3967000	3969000	With sort of
3969000	3971000	According to
3971000	3973000	The creator
3973000	3975000	Kawamori Shōji
3975000	3977000	That this is not an
3977000	3979000	Exact final word on what happened
3979000	3981000	With the crew
3981000	3983000	Of the SDF-2 Megarode 1
3983000	3985000	Which was the ship
3985000	3987000	That was taking everybody else
3987000	3989000	To, you know, discover what was
3989000	3991000	At the center of the galaxy
3991000	3993000	Um, this is just
3993000	3995000	Sort of like a dramatization
3995000	3997000	About what might have happened
3997000	3999000	But you basically
3999000	4001000	It shows you, you know, leaving Earth
4001000	4003000	And, you know, fighting, you know
4003000	4005000	A bunch of Zentradi everywhere
4005000	4007000	And it was
4007000	4009000	Actually a pretty, pretty cool
4009000	4011000	Game, it's one of my favorites
4011000	4013000	And they actually had
4013000	4015000	New dialogue recorded for
4015000	4017000	The game when it came out
4017000	4019000	By Mari Ijima
4019000	4021000	Who was Min May's voice actor
4021000	4023000	And yeah, Min May is still annoying
4023000	4025000	But, she's Min May
4025000	4027000	But lots of, you know
4027000	4029000	Shooting, you could lock on
4029000	4031000	Different enemies
4031000	4033000	In foreground and everything
4033000	4035000	It was pretty cool
4035000	4037000	And it also came out on PlayStation
4037000	4039000	And I actually have both copies
4039000	4041000	Don't ask
4041000	4043000	I came into them somehow or another
4043000	4045000	For cheap
4045000	4047000	It really is, you know
4047000	4049000	I'd say for any Macross fan
4049000	4051000	It is the game you should have
4051000	4053000	I've got actually a ton of
4053000	4055000	Macross games, I've got
4055000	4057000	The
4057000	4059000	Macross Plus game
4059000	4061000	I have Macross M3 for Dreamcast
4061000	4063000	But of all of them I think
4063000	4065000	This one is probably my favorite
4065000	4067000	Did I take the back? There's one on PC Engine
4067000	4069000	That I really like, but this one is
4069000	4071000	The more easily accessible one that I like
4071000	4073000	It's definitely
4073000	4075000	One that any
4075000	4077000	Macross and shooter fan should have
4077000	4079000	I mean, is that not just epic?
4079000	4081000	I'm not as familiar with the
4081000	4083000	Anime series, but it certainly looks like a
4083000	4085000	Heck of a shooter, but your
4085000	4087000	Your plane is huge
4087000	4089000	It takes up a pretty big chunk of the screen
4089000	4091000	I'm kind of surprised there
4091000	4093000	Between different modes
4093000	4095000	As you see it's in the
4095000	4097000	The full on robot mode, there's a
4097000	4099000	Girl walk mode which is like a half way in between
4099000	4101000	But
4101000	4103000	This did come out of here as Robotech
4103000	4105000	Gotcha
4105000	4107000	It's pretty epic
4107000	4109000	Pretty cool game
4109000	4111000	Alright
4111000	4113000	Well there it is folks, your classic
4113000	4115000	Game of the week
4115000	4117000	Macross Do You Remember Love?
4117000	4119000	On the Saturday
4119000	4121000	Check it out
4121000	4123000	Oh you know Dark Soccer
4123000	4125000	Loves her Saturn games
4125000	4127000	And we're starting off 2010 no differently
4127000	4129000	We're going to take a quick break and when we come back
4129000	4131000	We'll have plenty more of Orange Launch Radio
4131000	4133000	We've got some quick news for you this week
4133000	4135000	Including what's latest and greatest on the Virtual Console
4135000	4137000	And iPhone games and Rock Band
4137000	4139000	And we do have some other news
4139000	4141000	We're going to get into, including 8-bit
4141000	4143000	NES developments, yes, believe it or not
4143000	4145000	And video games
4145000	4147000	Meet obscure Winter Olympic Sports
4147000	4149000	I kid you not
4149000	4151000	And of course, Listless
4151000	4153000	Tonight's topic for Listless
4153000	4155000	And if you've never done Listless before, please please join us
4155000	4157000	And chat because the chat room plays a big big role in this
4157000	4159000	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
4159000	4161000	Tonight's topic, Thing I
4161000	4163000	Most Want to Happen in Gaming
4163000	4165000	In 2010
4165000	4167000	This could get very interesting because as you know
4167000	4169000	Sometimes we're serious and sometimes
4169000	4171000	We're not
4171000	4179000	Let's get back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4179000	4181000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
4181000	4183000	We are live on this January
4183000	4185000	The 3rd, 2010
4185000	4187000	That's right, our first show
4187000	4189000	Of the new decade
4189000	4191000	Well, okay, you could get into that whole argument that the decade
4191000	4193000	Doesn't really begin until it's a one
4193000	4195000	Because, you know, the first
4195000	4197000	But we're going by VH1's rules, okay
4197000	4199000	So just, you know, everybody else says the new decades
4199000	4201000	There you go
4201000	4203000	Anyhow, whatever it is, it's the first show of the year
4203000	4205000	And we're here to talk about gaming news
4205000	4207000	Although it's been somewhat of a light news week
4207000	4209000	Obviously, the holidays are still going on
4209000	4211000	Lots of companies
4211000	4213000	Either furloughed their workers
4213000	4215000	Or forced PTO on their workers
4215000	4217000	And I'm sure a lot of the game companies were no different
4217000	4219000	This week, and probably the publishing companies
4219000	4221000	That run a lot of the stories too
4221000	4223000	And PR firms
4223000	4225000	All kind of taking the week off
4225000	4227000	So I'm sure that's part of the reason why it's very quiet
4227000	4229000	But with a very full first quarter this year
4229000	4231000	In fact, more so than other years past
4231000	4233000	That I can think of
4233000	4235000	News is going to pick up in the next few weeks
4235000	4237000	So we'll stay on top of it the best we can
4237000	4239000	Especially, I think, in a couple weeks
4239000	4241000	We've got CES
4241000	4243000	Oh, that's true
4243000	4245000	There's sometimes a surprise or two
4245000	4247000	I mean, CES is more of like the TVs
4247000	4249000	And the home devices
4249000	4251000	Well, it's technology, but hey, you know
4251000	4253000	There are some gaming things that come out of that
4253000	4255000	Or you might see Aibo too
4255000	4257000	I mean, I don't think we'll see Aibo too
4257000	4259000	I don't think we will either
4259000	4261000	Doesn't bow well
4261000	4263000	Outlook not good
4263000	4265000	By the way, Listlist coming up later this hour as well
4265000	4267000	Because, you know, somebody pointed out to me
4267000	4269000	You guys haven't done an OLR game in like a year
4269000	4271000	And I'm like, you know, I don't think
4271000	4273000	Since we moved to Studio Dark Sakura
4273000	4275000	Have we done a single game
4275000	4277000	And a lot of that is because we're in a tighter space
4277000	4279000	Now than we used to be, so we don't have a lot of guests in here
4279000	4281000	That will be changing
4281000	4283000	That hopefully will be changing as we get more guests
4283000	4285000	And etc.
4285000	4287000	Alright
4287000	4289000	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news
4289000	4291000	Believe it or not, some things did happen
4291000	4293000	And we'll get into that
4293000	4295000	And then we'll get into Twitter topics after the news
4295000	4297000	Let those last few tweets come in on Twitter
4297000	4299000	So let's do rapid fire first
4299000	4301000	Well, we talked about in part A
4301000	4303000	How we've missed a lot of games that have been coming out
4303000	4305000	Well, I know for a fact
4305000	4307000	That I've missed a ton of stuff that's come out on
4307000	4309000	Xbox Live Indie Games
4309000	4311000	And here's a few games you may want to check out
4311000	4313000	First we've got
4313000	4315000	Office Politics
4315000	4317000	Which is the game you can have for the
4317000	4319000	Large sum of 80 Microsoft Points
4319000	4321000	Or $1
4321000	4323000	And it's basically kind of an Office sim
4323000	4325000	I guess
4325000	4327000	Not really like
4327000	4329000	I think Sony was pitching something like that
4329000	4331000	Rat Race that was supposed to be like a comedy
4331000	4333000	But this is very
4333000	4335000	Sims-ish
4335000	4337000	You have to manage both like
4337000	4339000	Your hunger
4339000	4341000	And how tired you are and that kind of stuff
4341000	4343000	So you can take power naps
4343000	4345000	And wonder where people are
4345000	4347000	How much you sneak on the internet?
4347000	4349000	Yep, all that fun stuff
4349000	4351000	So check that out
4351000	4353000	Ceiling Cat is watching you
4353000	4355000	Available for $1, that's a great price
4355000	4357000	There's another game, Battle Beat
4357000	4359000	It's a
4359000	4361000	Looks like almost a defense game
4361000	4363000	Very similar to say
4363000	4365000	Oh, I don't know
4365000	4367000	Like a tower defense game?
4367000	4369000	Like the Crystal Bears?
4369000	4371000	Not so much like that
4371000	4373000	It gets a little bit like a tower defense game
4373000	4375000	A little bit like Plants vs. Zombies
4375000	4377000	But you attack
4377000	4379000	And play the game with
4379000	4381000	Kind of like a beat
4381000	4383000	A little bit mixed with
4383000	4385000	A matching
4385000	4387000	Music game or something like that
4387000	4389000	So it's kind of neat, kind of fun
4389000	4391000	But since it's an indie game, don't expect any licenses
4391000	4393000	It's all kind of original beats
4393000	4395000	So it's pretty cool
4395000	4397000	It's a strategy game
4397000	4399000	So check that out, Battle Beat
4399000	4401000	That's also on Xbox Indie Games
4401000	4403000	And then finally the best one
4403000	4405000	The funniest one I think
4405000	4407000	Is Gerbil Physics
4407000	4409000	And this is also on Xbox
4409000	4411000	Oh god
4411000	4413000	And it's these gerbils
4413000	4415000	Like in little blocks and stuff
4415000	4417000	And they make funny faces
4417000	4419000	When you stick bombs next to them
4419000	4421000	Also a dollar
4421000	4423000	When you stick bombs next to them
4423000	4425000	You explode the gerbils
4425000	4427000	Yes, it's a little bit like Boom Block
4427000	4429000	It's sad
4429000	4431000	And it's just funny though
4431000	4433000	Hold on, is that a YouTube you're looking at there?
4433000	4435000	Yes it is
4435000	4437000	I know this is terrible radio
4437000	4439000	Looking at YouTubes, but I need to see
4439000	4441000	What this is all about
4441000	4443000	And maybe we'll hear some hideous noises
4443000	4445000	Through on
4445000	4447000	And
4449000	4451000	So there's all these little gerbils
4451000	4453000	Trapped in little blocks or something
4453000	4455000	You put bombs by them
4457000	4459000	They'll show the bombs in just a sec
4459000	4461000	I don't know really
4461000	4463000	But look at how their eyes get all big
4463000	4465000	And stuff like that
4465000	4467000	They look like gerbils trapped in blocks
4467000	4469000	Like how Superman's parents were trapped in the big mirror
4469000	4471000	At the beginning
4471000	4473000	It wasn't his parents
4473000	4475000	It was the three in the negatives
4475000	4477000	Whatever
4477000	4479000	Whoever the hell they were at the beginning of Superman
4479000	4481000	You will kneel before Zod
4481000	4483000	The people
4483000	4485000	Oh yeah, that's right
4485000	4487000	Because they were the people that ended up being the villains in the second movie
4487000	4489000	Whatever
4489000	4491000	That's what these gerbils look like
4491000	4493000	They look like they're trapped in the magic mirror
4493000	4495000	That's funny
4495000	4497000	So yes
4497000	4499000	You have gerbils and you're supposed to be
4499000	4501000	I think knocking them below a line
4501000	4503000	And it's cute
4503000	4505000	And you don't really injure them
4505000	4507000	But they get scared because they're being flung across the screen
4507000	4509000	And you're detonating bombs next to them
4509000	4511000	But hey, a dollar
4511000	4513000	Once again, one dollar, twenty-four levels
4513000	4515000	So I mean, that's a great price
4515000	4517000	Amaze Satsuma
4517000	4519000	In our chatroom at chat.org.com
4519000	4521000	Thinks this might have been brought to us by PETA
4521000	4523000	People Exploding Tasty Animals
4525000	4527000	That was from the chat, not from me
4527000	4529000	Views and opinions do not necessarily reflect
4529000	4531000	You laughed, you're going to hell too
4531000	4533000	I did laugh
4533000	4537000	Other things not related to Xbox Indie Games
4537000	4539000	Coming to the Wii
4539000	4541000	And this is talking about a
4541000	4543000	Blast from the past
4543000	4545000	Fast Draw Showdown
4545000	4547000	Looks like something that could be straight out of
4547000	4549000	Mad Dog McCree
4549000	4551000	And basically, kind of is
4551000	4553000	It's actually coming from Digital Leisure
4553000	4555000	Which I believe did Mad Dog McCree
4555000	4557000	Or at least published it at one time
4557000	4559000	And they're kind of known for some of the
4559000	4561000	You know, full motion
4561000	4563000	Video games
4563000	4565000	But this is like a Fast Draw game
4565000	4567000	Using the Wii Remote as like your gun
4567000	4569000	But you've got of course full motion video
4569000	4573000	Of cheesy people dressed up like cowboys
4573000	4575000	From the 80's
4575000	4577000	And uh
4577000	4579000	Back when they made laserdisc games for the sake of
4579000	4581000	Making laserdisc games and nothing more
4581000	4583000	Pretty much, yeah
4583000	4585000	Some of those games were pretty terrible
4585000	4587000	CD-ROM games, like remember when CD-ROMs
4587000	4589000	Were new on the computer?
4589000	4591000	And they made some shittacious
4591000	4593000	And I'm making up a new word there
4593000	4595000	Shittacious games
4595000	4597000	Just because you could have movies
4597000	4599000	Although there were some
4599000	4601000	Interesting ones in there too, like
4601000	4603000	Return to Zork I think was one of those games
4603000	4605000	I miss Mega Race, didn't it have Don Knots in it or something?
4605000	4607000	Fucking Don Knots
4607000	4609000	I don't know, I think it did
4609000	4611000	Didn't really play Mega Race
4611000	4613000	That was more your thing
4613000	4615000	I think that game is on GameTap
4615000	4617000	But that's back when I was using GameTap
4617000	4619000	When it was cooler
4619000	4621000	I can't say it's there now, I don't know
4621000	4623000	It was one of those games that
4623000	4625000	Really needed a two speed CD-ROM
4625000	4627000	And I had an external
4627000	4629000	Big ass
4629000	4631000	Single speed CD-ROM disc drive
4631000	4633000	So it ran kind of slow
4633000	4635000	And then later on when I got a
4635000	4637000	Newer computer and it had like a
4637000	4639000	Was a 16 speed CD-ROM drive
4639000	4641000	Which was like lightning fast
4641000	4643000	It popped in there
4643000	4645000	And the game ran too fast
4645000	4647000	I would like to see
4647000	4649000	The WiiWare emulate
4649000	4651000	Speaking of Shittacious
4651000	4653000	Remember the hologram games we had?
4653000	4655000	Oh yeah
4655000	4657000	There was a western one
4657000	4659000	I think there was only two
4659000	4661000	Hologram games
4661000	4663000	I think there was a time traveling one
4663000	4665000	They had the first levels of western
4665000	4667000	Maybe that's what I'm thinking, because I could never get past the first level
4667000	4669000	Because those games controlled like butt
4669000	4671000	Yes they did
4671000	4673000	I would like to see that crap on WiiWare
4673000	4675000	For no other reason than it fits
4675000	4677000	Well when we get to our holographic games
4677000	4679000	I'm sure that'll be like some of the first levels of the game
4679000	4681000	When we get to the holodeck
4681000	4683000	I'll be able to play that game all over again
4683000	4685000	And then you can go fuck this shit
4685000	4687000	And throw it across the room because it's virtual
4687000	4689000	And you can do that
4689000	4691000	A hitstun in our chatroom
4691000	4693000	At chat.orangelessradio.com wants to point out
4693000	4695000	Mega Race 1 and 2
4695000	4697000	Are on GOG.com
4697000	4699000	They run in DOSBox
4699000	4701000	Awesome
4701000	4703000	I do think that they should make an indie game called
4703000	4705000	Fuck This Shit where you throw controllers at things
4705000	4707000	And that would be funny
4709000	4711000	Especially if they're wiimotes
4711000	4713000	Because Nintendo is really trying hard
4713000	4715000	To get away from that image of the
4715000	4717000	Wiimotes going into televisions
4717000	4719000	That would be hilarious
4719000	4721000	And this week on the
4721000	4723000	Rockband music store
4723000	4725000	I'm sorry, real quick, do you think that would get on to
4725000	4727000	Xbox Live indie games, a game called Fuck This Shit?
4727000	4729000	Well you obviously would have to
4729000	4731000	You know, freak this stuff
4731000	4733000	Frack this
4737000	4739000	Shoot, frack this shoot
4739000	4741000	I don't know
4741000	4743000	Patent pending
4743000	4745000	Rockband this week
4745000	4747000	Of course we've talked about this for a few weeks now
4747000	4749000	Different things coming
4749000	4751000	Including the Paul McCartney download pack
4751000	4753000	Which I saw commercials for this
4753000	4755000	They are actually advertising
4755000	4757000	Download content on
4757000	4759000	VH1 and stuff
4759000	4761000	I was like, what?
4761000	4763000	But it's Paul McCartney so I guess maybe that's why
4763000	4765000	Well you know, it's kind of a big deal
4765000	4767000	When it's Paul McCartney
4767000	4769000	Three songs, I mean, come on
4769000	4771000	But yeah, they've got a
4771000	4773000	Live pack including Band on the Run, Jet
4773000	4775000	And Sing the Changes
4775000	4777000	Each of those available for two bucks
4777000	4779000	160 Microsoft Points
4779000	4781000	Or 200 Wii Points
4781000	4783000	We really do need to do conversion for you
4783000	4785000	For that, and of course you save 50 cents
4785000	4787000	If you buy them in a pack
4787000	4789000	Also coming in a three pack
4789000	4791000	Blink 182 Pack 2
4791000	4793000	Also available for $5.50 for a pack
4793000	4795000	And $1.99 each
4795000	4797000	And they include Adam's Song, First 8
4797000	4799000	And I Miss You
4799000	4801000	And then finally the individual tracks also available
4801000	4803000	For two bucks each
4803000	4805000	We have the Psychedelic Furs with Love My Way
4805000	4807000	And Sister Europe
4807000	4809000	And the Ramones with Rock and Roll High School
4809000	4811000	Which
4811000	4813000	That's pretty fun
4813000	4815000	I got linked by Hitstun in the chat room
4815000	4817000	To an article that talks about Matt Hazard
4817000	4819000	And those games, this is an article that was running on some of the gaming blogs this week
4819000	4821000	I guess there is a
4821000	4823000	Upcoming Xbox Live
4823000	4825000	And PSN title in the series
4825000	4827000	Matt Hazard, Bloodbath, and beyond
4827000	4829000	One of the difficulty levels is called
4829000	4831000	Fuck This Shit
4831000	4833000	Is actually the difficulty level
4833000	4835000	So somebody did
4835000	4837000	Kind of think about it
4837000	4839000	The game isn't called Fuck This Shit
4839000	4841000	It probably will be after you play it
4841000	4843000	Fuck This Shit
4843000	4845000	Why'd I pay for this?
4845000	4847000	Dammit
4847000	4849000	Who knows, who knows
4849000	4851000	Let's move on and talk about some other
4851000	4853000	Quick news topics this week
4853000	4855000	Loki brought up Plants vs. Zombies earlier
4855000	4857000	And I know some rumors have come up before
4857000	4859000	About the game coming over to iPhone
4859000	4861000	Well it does sound like it is happening
4861000	4863000	It's supposed to be coming to the iPhone
4863000	4865000	And of course that means the iPod Touch as well
4865000	4867000	January is what they're saying
4867000	4869000	That's from PopCap's Facebook page
4869000	4871000	No word yet if
4871000	4873000	Apple's approval process will
4873000	4875000	Fuck all that shit up
4875000	4877000	DJ David
4877000	4879000	And I always mispronounce his last name
4879000	4881000	Guetta I think is how you say it
4881000	4883000	He had a download pack available in DJ Hero
4883000	4885000	You can play some of the songs
4885000	4887000	And the odd thing about it is that
4887000	4889000	It's some of the rare songs in the games
4889000	4891000	That aren't mixed with anything
4891000	4893000	They're remixes of those songs
4893000	4895000	They're not mashups
4895000	4897000	There's very very few songs in DJ Hero
4897000	4899000	Like that but all those track packs
4899000	4901000	I want to go back and play that
4901000	4903000	I actually downloaded it and never played it
4903000	4905000	Did you know the very last song in the game
4905000	4907000	I don't think this is a spoiler
4907000	4909000	The very very last thing you unlock
4909000	4911000	Is Herbie Hancock's Rocket
4911000	4913000	With all that insane scratching
4913000	4915000	Yeah
4915000	4917000	That's the last song that you get
4917000	4919000	And it is hell
4919000	4921000	It isn't mixed with anything because the song
4921000	4923000	Like when I first played it you know what I said
4923000	4925000	Fuck this shit that's what I said
4925000	4927000	It's the one song in the game
4927000	4929000	I can't get more than like two stars on
4929000	4931000	On hard
4931000	4933000	Anyhow back to David Guetta
4933000	4935000	Cause I liked his songs quite a bit that were in the download pack
4935000	4937000	Well apparently he is actually working on
4937000	4939000	What he called the number two
4939000	4941000	Version of the game
4941000	4943000	I don't think he means the poop version
4943000	4945000	I think he actually means DJ Hero 2
4945000	4947000	Which you could read as some type of confirmation
4947000	4949000	Of a DJ Hero 2
4949000	4951000	Although I mean
4951000	4953000	File that next to Duh and of course
4953000	4955000	But you know it is kind of cool
4955000	4957000	That he is involved with it
4957000	4959000	Because you know a lot of DJs
4959000	4961000	Very prevalent ones showed up in the first game
4961000	4963000	So it's kind of cool that they're working with a different handful
4963000	4965000	Of folks for the second game
4965000	4967000	I'd like to see what kind of mashups he might produce
4967000	4969000	Cause he does some very dancy clubby type of stuff
4969000	4971000	So that would be kind of neat
4971000	4973000	To see what he puts together for
4973000	4975000	DJ Hero 2
4975000	4977000	One other quick note on a completely different note
4977000	4979000	Ogre Battle 64
4979000	4981000	I don't know if you remember this game
4981000	4983000	You might not cause I think it's one of those
4983000	4985000	Really rare games that was out
4985000	4987000	On Nintendo 64
4987000	4989000	It is apparently making its way to the virtual
4989000	4991000	Console at some point in January
4991000	4993000	Oh for Japan anyway
4993000	4995000	But as you know
4995000	4997000	Usually these games that come out in Japan
4997000	4999000	Do make their way over here
4999000	5001000	Some other things that are coming out on the Japanese
5001000	5003000	Virtual console, Princess Tomato and
5003000	5005000	Salad Kingdom remember that game on the Nintendo
5005000	5007000	That's coming out, Kirby's Star Stacker
5007000	5009000	And Salamander and Parodius
5009000	5011000	For the MSX
5011000	5013000	Cause remember they get
5013000	5015000	They get MSX over there
5015000	5017000	Which we have yet to get
5017000	5019000	Probably because those games aren't in English
5019000	5021000	At all
5021000	5023000	At all
5023000	5025000	Although I really wish we would get the MSX games
5025000	5027000	Cause you know what that means we could get is
5027000	5029000	Guardic
5029000	5031000	That's right the game that the Guardian Legend was technically a sequel to
5031000	5033000	Dark Stacker what do you got for us?
5033000	5035000	Some stuff
5035000	5037000	We actually have
5037000	5039000	A new
5039000	5041000	Trademark from Sega
5041000	5043000	Let's Go Island
5043000	5045000	Which the theory
5045000	5047000	Is that it might be a sequel to
5047000	5049000	Let's Go Jungle
5049000	5051000	So
5051000	5053000	Who knows but basically
5053000	5055000	The way that Let's Go Jungle was
5055000	5057000	You had guns
5057000	5059000	And you shot your way through the jungle
5059000	5061000	It was
5061000	5063000	Though it's a potential though that
5063000	5065000	This is going to be one for the Wii
5065000	5067000	So it could be who knows
5067000	5069000	Also
5069000	5071000	Microsoft wants avatars
5071000	5073000	To reflect
5073000	5075000	Actual physical characteristics
5075000	5077000	They've
5077000	5079000	Put out a patent
5079000	5081000	Application for
5081000	5083000	Avatar individualized by
5083000	5085000	Physical characteristics
5085000	5087000	So they want to
5087000	5089000	Eliminate the artificial look
5089000	5091000	And make it look like someone actually
5091000	5093000	Really looks
5095000	5097000	I'm not really sure
5097000	5099000	How they're going to pull that up
5099000	5101000	But they're basically saying that
5101000	5103000	They want to have a bit more reality
5103000	5105000	In the game
5105000	5107000	And actually be able to portray people
5107000	5109000	Accurately
5109000	5111000	And that
5111000	5113000	They're basically going to be pulling like
5113000	5115000	Actual health data
5115000	5117000	And you can spend points on it
5117000	5119000	Yeah there's some controversy behind this
5119000	5121000	Because I seem to remember hearing somewhere
5121000	5123000	That this ties into
5123000	5125000	Like
5125000	5127000	Hey fatty stop playing the game basically
5127000	5129000	Like that could be the next
5129000	5131000	Development which would suck
5131000	5133000	Because people should be able to do what they want
5133000	5135000	Yeah
5135000	5137000	Well there's now
5137000	5139000	Well a pachinko game
5139000	5141000	That is
5141000	5143000	Castlevania
5143000	5145000	It's Castlevania Pachislot
5145000	5147000	And it has a story
5147000	5149000	Where you are Trevor Belmont
5149000	5151000	Challenging Dracula
5151000	5153000	And being helped by Angela
5153000	5155000	Who's a sorceress
5155000	5157000	And it actually
5157000	5159000	You can buy the soundtrack to the game too
5159000	5161000	It's pretty
5161000	5163000	Kinda
5163000	5165000	There's even a video of it
5165000	5167000	That's funny
5167000	5169000	Because you know there's a Gradius pachinko
5169000	5171000	I'm kind of surprised
5171000	5173000	This is the first Castlevania
5173000	5175000	Pachinko machine
5175000	5177000	Well there's also a Parodius one too
5177000	5179000	That I've actually
5179000	5181000	Found a playthrough
5181000	5183000	About
5183000	5185000	This is pretty neat
5185000	5187000	I would be surprised if this is the first
5187000	5189000	Because keep in mind that Konami does slot machines
5189000	5191000	Is a big business area
5191000	5193000	It's actually got pretty cool graphics
5193000	5195000	And I'm assuming it could be pachinko machines over in Japan
5195000	5197000	Because we don't really see those here
5197000	5199000	But I have seen Konami slot machines here in the US
5199000	5201000	This is actually pretty hot
5201000	5203000	Nice
5203000	5205000	Why can't they actually do a good game like this?
5205000	5207000	That's what I was thinking
5207000	5209000	That looks better than a lot of the games that have come out recently
5209000	5211000	Like Judgment?
5211000	5213000	Yeah
5213000	5215000	Let's go to the Twitter
5215000	5217000	You know Judgment would have been really good
5217000	5219000	On the Playstation 1
5219000	5221000	Let's go to the Twitter
5221000	5223000	And look at some Twitter topics tonight from you guys
5223000	5225000	The listeners, you guys have sent us a few things tonight
5225000	5227000	Let's start it off with Blue Swim wants to know
5227000	5229000	What game or franchise do you think
5229000	5231000	Will be each system's biggest selling title
5231000	5233000	In Holiday 2010
5233000	5235000	This is really hard, dude
5235000	5237000	Because a lot of these games
5237000	5239000	We don't know about yet
5239000	5241000	Because E3 is kind of when the Holiday lineups are announced
5241000	5243000	So these are really shots in the dark
5243000	5245000	I would say probably the biggest seller
5245000	5247000	Out of any of them is gonna be
5247000	5249000	I think Nintendo's gonna unveil the new Zelda
5249000	5251000	This year's E3 and that'll probably be the big one
5251000	5253000	Because Wii's got the biggest market
5253000	5255000	You know, clutch right now
5255000	5257000	Otherwise, if there's
5257000	5259000	Some type of new Call of Duty game next year
5259000	5261000	I'm sure that will take the crown too
5261000	5263000	No, because if it's the actual trend
5263000	5265000	It's gonna be not the Infinity Ward game
5265000	5267000	But it's gonna be the other one
5267000	5269000	Forget the other company
5269000	5271000	Not the Infinity Ward here
5271000	5273000	Alright, fine
5273000	5275000	But I think Zelda will also be a big one
5275000	5277000	So
5277000	5279000	I don't think it has to be necessarily
5279000	5281000	First party either
5281000	5283000	I think when we bring up these third party activisions
5283000	5285000	And so forth
5285000	5287000	And it's kind of on multiple systems
5287000	5289000	Because Modern Warfare was probably the biggest seller, right?
5289000	5291000	Yeah
5291000	5293000	This year, and that was on multiple systems
5293000	5295000	Let's see
5295000	5297000	Going to
5297000	5299000	VonToxic on Twitter says
5299000	5301000	If Tinker isn't on your news list
5301000	5303000	You should mention it
5303000	5305000	It's free on Games for Windows Live
5305000	5307000	And it has achievements
5307000	5309000	I don't know if VonToxic might have something to do with this game
5309000	5311000	But hey, I'm off for free
5311000	5313000	And yeah, that's Windows' new games on demand thing
5313000	5315000	You know, kind of like their Steam competitor type thing
5315000	5317000	Hey, Steam
5317000	5319000	Do these achievement points
5319000	5321000	Steam
5321000	5323000	Kind of blend together with my achievement points on Xbox Live
5323000	5325000	I doubt they do
5325000	5327000	Because I don't think the PC like Halo 2 had them
5327000	5329000	And I don't think they blended
5329000	5331000	Well, Grand Theft Auto 4 does
5331000	5333000	They have achievements
5333000	5335000	And
5335000	5337000	I'm not sure
5337000	5339000	I know it shows up when I play Grand Theft Auto 4
5339000	5341000	And it's kind of pathetic
5341000	5343000	Because Grand Theft Auto 4 has no protections on it
5343000	5345000	Well, it had minimal protections on it
5345000	5347000	So you could cheat really easy
5347000	5349000	And all of that stuff
5349000	5351000	Well, it looks kind of like a puzzle-y type of game
5351000	5353000	It uses this little kind of isometric
5353000	5355000	It looks like
5355000	5357000	Is this like some type of reincarnation of Devil's Dice?
5357000	5359000	Because I noticed it uses dice
5359000	5361000	In kind of an isometric playing field there
5361000	5363000	So I don't know, I'll have to download this myself
5363000	5365000	And check it out, I'm off for free
5365000	5367000	But I like some of these achievement names
5367000	5369000	Like SmackMySwitchUp
5369000	5373000	Switch1, Switch2, Switch3, Profit
5373000	5375000	So whatever that means, that's 10 achievement points right there
5375000	5377000	It's got to be more than Devil's Dice
5377000	5379000	Because I see dominoes, I see little targets
5379000	5381000	This is clearly some type of
5381000	5383000	Like a little puzzle game
5383000	5385000	Based off toys you would find in a kids room
5385000	5387000	But that's Tinkr
5387000	5389000	And I'm all for free
5389000	5391000	So I'll have to check that out for next week
5391000	5393000	Let's see
5393000	5395000	Tigerclaw sent us a list of
5395000	5399000	Xbox Live games for mobile phones
5399000	5401000	I guess that's something being looked at
5401000	5403000	Let's see
5403000	5405000	He's linking us to an article from
5405000	5407000	MTV's multiplayer blog
5407000	5409000	Saying that Microsoft wants to do more
5409000	5411000	Between Xbox Live and Windows Mobile enabled devices
5411000	5413000	Of course, anything to
5413000	5415000	Nickel and dime at the iPhone
5415000	5417000	And kind of get back at them for that
5417000	5419000	Talking about avatars on the phones
5419000	5421000	Being able to do Xbox Live
5421000	5423000	Social media
5423000	5425000	Multi-screen experiences
5425000	5427000	They're hiring what's called a principal program manager
5427000	5429000	That's going to drive the platform
5429000	5431000	And bring Xbox Live enabled games
5431000	5433000	To Windows Mobile
5433000	5435000	You know when I hear this
5435000	5437000	I kind of think about the whole
5437000	5439000	Remember the Fable pub games
5439000	5441000	That tied into Fable 2
5441000	5443000	I could see something like that happening with this
5443000	5445000	You have a mobile game that kind of enhances
5445000	5447000	An existing game
5447000	5449000	But doesn't necessarily take the place of it
5449000	5451000	If that makes sense
5451000	5453000	Yeah
5453000	5455000	And especially if they tie it into one of their big franchises
5455000	5457000	I'm sure it could be quite the big thing
5457000	5459000	Marin Marvel
5459000	5461000	A good friend of ours says
5461000	5463000	Final Fantasy 4 the after years is a fun
5463000	5465000	Bit of nostalgia
5465000	5467000	What other series would you play an after years game for?
5467000	5469000	Me?
5469000	5471000	Final Fantasy 6
5471000	5473000	I don't know, anything else you'd like to see
5473000	5475000	Like a retro sequel
5475000	5477000	Episodic nostalgic
5477000	5479000	Tickle your nostalgia bone type of game?
5479000	5481000	For Final Fantasy
5481000	5483000	Anything really, I mean Final Fantasy 4
5483000	5485000	She happened to name Final Fantasy 6
5485000	5487000	But I don't think, I think we can name anything
5487000	5489000	I'd like to see a new jet
5489000	5491000	I was thinking the same thing, Dark Soccer, Chrono Trigger
5491000	5493000	A good one
5493000	5495000	Something in that same vein
5495000	5497000	Ironically enough I don't know if it would be after years
5497000	5499000	Because Chrono Trigger was all over the map
5499000	5501000	But that would be awesome
5501000	5503000	I would like to see a new jet moto game
5503000	5505000	But that
5505000	5507000	Okay
5507000	5509000	It's old enough by now
5509000	5511000	Yeah, but I was thinking more like a story
5511000	5513000	Kind of base thing, but I guess anything works
5513000	5515000	Story based game
5515000	5517000	You know, these role playing games
5517000	5519000	That never really
5519000	5521000	Got fully realized, you know
5521000	5523000	Like an actual Xenogears sequel
5523000	5525000	A Xenos saga
5525000	5527000	Eh, not so much
5527000	5529000	Let's see
5529000	5531000	Um
5531000	5533000	I'm actually
5533000	5535000	Reading our chat room here
5535000	5537000	On Pachinko machines
5537000	5539000	I'm looking, kind of catching up on our chat room
5539000	5541000	chat.orensonstrategy.com
5541000	5543000	Very interesting perspective from AkumaJP
5543000	5545000	Because he lives over in Japan
5545000	5547000	And kind of gives us some perspective
5547000	5549000	I know we have a couple of folks that listen in Japan
5549000	5551000	I think that's great
5551000	5553000	He says Pachinko in arcade is a different store here in Tokyo
5553000	5555000	Pachinko is bad because it's gambling
5555000	5557000	And Pachinko can look good because the developer cost is different
5557000	5559000	And the limit for developers is different too
5559000	5561000	So Pachinko is mostly computers
5561000	5563000	I didn't realize they separated that in Japan
5563000	5565000	The Pachinkos and arcade machines
5565000	5567000	Were kind of in different places
5567000	5569000	I mean it makes sense
5569000	5571000	You don't have slot machines
5571000	5573000	Next to Street Fighter 4
5573000	5575000	Here in the states
5575000	5577000	But at the same time
5577000	5579000	We have like things that are practically like
5579000	5581000	Little kid gambling devices
5581000	5583000	But they give you tickets
5583000	5585000	They don't give you money, they give you tickets
5585000	5587000	And that, I mean those have taken over arcades
5587000	5589000	Sadly in the past 10 years
5589000	5591000	These arcades have kind of been dying out
5591000	5593000	Bitters I call them
5593000	5595000	You know something like
5595000	5597000	Hit the button when the wheel is in a certain spot
5597000	5599000	And this one little sliver will give you
5599000	5601000	The jackpot whereas the things around
5601000	5603000	It only give you like 4 tickets
5603000	5605000	And then you trade your tickets in for crap prizes
5605000	5607000	Like that's kind of what we have instead of Pachinko
5607000	5609000	So I don't know
5609000	5611000	Let's see also
5611000	5613000	On the Twitter
5613000	5615000	Dan Shadow asks, what do you think of Bayonetta's sexiness?
5615000	5617000	Is the one handed mode too much?
5617000	5619000	Is there really a one handed mode or is that a joke?
5619000	5621000	It's a one button mode
5621000	5623000	Oh I see
5623000	5625000	And
5625000	5627000	I don't think she's that sexy
5627000	5629000	In the game, it's more of just kicking ass
5629000	5631000	All the time and so it's so over the top
5631000	5633000	I think she's very sassy
5633000	5635000	That she uses her hair as a weapon
5635000	5637000	That's sassy
5637000	5639000	It's the glasses Rob
5639000	5641000	It's the glasses
5641000	5643000	Trust me, why do you think I'm never getting rid of mine?
5643000	5645000	I see
5645000	5647000	It's a trick
5647000	5649000	So kind of a show tip
5649000	5651000	From Spazinator
5651000	5653000	Wanting to know that
5653000	5655000	Hold on, it got cut off
5655000	5657000	I gotta reload the Twitter here
5657000	5659000	Live radio folks, sometimes things screw up
5659000	5661000	Cause we got some late tweets
5661000	5663000	And it threw everything off here
5663000	5665000	Spazinator says, here's an idea for an unofficial game
5665000	5667000	While in a story
5667000	5669000	Blurt out a random, odd
5669000	5671000	And unrelated thing to say
5671000	5673000	To see if anyone is paying attention and notices
5673000	5675000	I know you three like tangents and randomness
5675000	5677000	So here's the chance to essentially make a game of it
5677000	5679000	As if this show doesn't get derailed enough
5679000	5681000	Doesn't that kind of already happen?
5681000	5683000	Yeah, it's called the show
5683000	5685000	I know, it's kind of what the show is based on
5685000	5687000	I mean, I like where you're going with that
5687000	5689000	But that's kind of been the longest running game
5689000	5691000	On this show
5691000	5693000	So there you go
5693000	5695000	Dr. Duar says, how about suggestions
5695000	5697000	For mobile games for smartphones
5697000	5699000	Other than the iPhone, thanks
5699000	5701000	That's a tricky one for me to answer
5701000	5703000	Because I have an iPhone, I know Dark Sakura has an iPhone
5703000	5705000	We're sheep
5705000	5707000	Loki doesn't have an iPhone, but you don't really use a fancy phone, do you?
5707000	5709000	I hardly use my phone
5709000	5711000	Yeah, your phone's never even on
5711000	5713000	It's on all the time, actually
5713000	5715000	Is that new?
5715000	5717000	No, it's been on forever now
5717000	5719000	It's like for months
5719000	5721000	Oh, for months, it's not like you've done that
5721000	5723000	For years and years
5723000	5725000	Because I remember I used to call it and you'd never be there
5725000	5727000	That's okay
5727000	5729000	I mean, you actually use a home phone
5729000	5731000	I don't even have a home phone, I only have my cell phone
5731000	5733000	So
5733000	5735000	Anyhow, sadly because of that
5735000	5737000	I would feel kind of ridiculous
5737000	5739000	Giving you other game recommendations when I haven't played any of them
5739000	5741000	I will have to turn to the chat
5741000	5743000	To help us answer that one
5743000	5745000	Chat room, do you guys have any suggestions for Dr. Duar
5745000	5747000	About what games he should be playing
5747000	5749000	On a smartphone that's not an iPhone
5749000	5751000	Because I would be curious about that
5751000	5755000	Amiga777 in chat says, y'all got iPhones
5755000	5757000	I demand an OLR app
5757000	5759000	I would love that if I knew how to do it
5759000	5763000	Owning an iPhone does not make you a programmer of an iPhone
5763000	5767000	And I do want to point out there is an all games radio app
5767000	5769000	So you can listen to this
5769000	5771000	Usually on the drive over to the studio
5771000	5773000	I listen to the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf
5773000	5775000	Through the all games iPhone app
5775000	5777000	So that's the best we have right now
5777000	5779000	We do have the PSP app
5779000	5781000	I will look into how to do an iPhone app
5781000	5783000	But at the same time
5783000	5785000	I don't want to just duplicate the functionality of the all games app
5785000	5787000	I mean, that's what it's there for
5787000	5789000	If I can think of something special
5789000	5791000	That only could be brought from an OLR app
5791000	5793000	Then maybe, but
5793000	5795000	Don't really see the point otherwise
5797000	5799000	But maybe you guys have some suggestions
5799000	5801000	I'm looking in chat
5801000	5803000	I see Ionotropic says
5803000	5805000	Kuglom for Blackberry
5805000	5807000	Is the game that's being recommended there
5807000	5809000	So
5809000	5811000	Some late tweets that came in
5811000	5813000	I almost didn't read these
5813000	5815000	But since they came in here, why not
5815000	5817000	Did you know that you can unlock a next gen
5817000	5819000	Filter in Uncharted 2
5819000	5821000	It just makes everything browner
5821000	5823000	What?
5823000	5825000	I hadn't heard of that
5825000	5827000	Is that just like for a look?
5827000	5829000	It's a joke, probably saying
5829000	5831000	Because their game is so colorful and vibrant
5831000	5833000	And all the other games are kind of brown and murky
5833000	5835000	I see, I get it now
5835000	5837000	Let's see, Ray Iannami says
5837000	5839000	8 on the breaks DJ Max Technica machine
5839000	5841000	Now has the Platinum Crew online service
5841000	5843000	That's a machine I haven't touched in a while
5843000	5845000	I haven't really been to Roseville Golf Land in a while
5845000	5847000	I remember they had one of those machines
5847000	5849000	I don't even know if they still do
5849000	5851000	That's pretty broken by now
5851000	5853000	I guess there's some new songs
5853000	5855000	And some stuff that was unlocked there
5855000	5857000	Kind of cool that there's still some arcades in America
5857000	5859000	At least somewhere, even if you have to go all the way to New Jersey to play them
5859000	5861000	That will do those cool little
5861000	5863000	Unlocks and online things
5863000	5865000	So apparently there was a huge line there
5865000	5867000	Let's check that out
5867000	5869000	Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and
5869000	5871000	Move back into some gaming news
5871000	5873000	Listless coming right up
5873000	5875000	We have just a few more stories for you guys before we get there
5875000	5877000	Yes
5877000	5879000	Including, and this is kind of neat
5879000	5881000	A brand new
5881000	5883000	Nintendo game
5883000	5885000	Now, I use the term new
5885000	5887000	Kind of
5887000	5889000	I don't know
5889000	5891000	Because this game
5891000	5893000	Looks exactly like Mega Man
5893000	5895000	In fact, I would take a wild guess and say it's probably a ROM hack
5895000	5897000	Of Mega Man
5897000	5899000	But hey, whatever
5899000	5901000	It's called Metal Kid Fortress of Peril
5901000	5903000	It plays very similar to Mega Man
5903000	5905000	It has the Mega Man type levels
5905000	5907000	Mega Man type gameplay, including the Mega Man type
5907000	5909000	Disappearing and reappearing blocks
5909000	5911000	Mega Man type boss battles
5911000	5913000	And some of the other things
5913000	5915000	Though, you do have an inventory system
5915000	5917000	Where you can add different abilities
5917000	5919000	Including a double jump, a floating feature
5919000	5921000	Different power-ups and whatnot
5921000	5923000	But what's kind of cool about it though
5923000	5925000	Is it's actually getting a cartridge release
5925000	5927000	As well
5927000	5929000	And there is a demo you can check out
5929000	5931000	That's available
5931000	5933000	I believe on the website
5933000	5935000	Retro Zone
5935000	5937000	That
5937000	5939000	You can play the demo
5939000	5941000	Of course, in your favorite
5941000	5943000	Nintendo emulator
5943000	5945000	But Retro Zone, of course, if you haven't
5945000	5947000	Looked at their website
5947000	5949000	In a while, they have wonderful things
5949000	5951000	Including reproductions of different games
5951000	5953000	Including the Nintendo World Championships
5953000	5955000	Cartridge, the Nintendo
5955000	5957000	College Tour
5957000	5959000	Cards, they even have
5959000	5961000	Ultimate Frogger, some homebrew
5961000	5963000	Glider game, and one
5963000	5965000	That didn't really make our show roll
5965000	5967000	But because it's a little late
5967000	5969000	An 8-bit X-mas cartridge
5969000	5971000	Which has a little light show that actually plays
5971000	5973000	In there as well
5973000	5975000	I heard about that, that's trippy
5975000	5977000	That's kind of a neat little Christmas decoration
5977000	5979000	Yeah, so it's kind of neat
5979000	5981000	And the game itself
5981000	5983000	I'm not sure how much it's being offered
5983000	5985000	My guess is it's going to be probably around $40
5985000	5987000	Which is a little expensive
5987000	5989000	But hey, you get a cartridge out of it
5989000	5991000	Personally
5991000	5993000	I don't know, it looks pretty hard
5993000	5995000	So that might be
5995000	5997000	Beneficial for
5997000	5999000	If you're looking for that, I guess
5999000	6001000	I don't know
6001000	6002000	It's neat
6002000	6004000	It's cool that there's a lot of love still
6004000	6006000	For the old school 8-bit games and so forth
6006000	6008000	But a ROM hack
6008000	6010000	That's a pretty bold accusation
6010000	6012000	You watch the video for it
6012000	6014000	I'll play you the video
6014000	6016000	The music's unique
6016000	6018000	But dude, you look at it
6018000	6020000	It's totally wrong
6020000	6022000	Fast forward a little ways here in the video
6022000	6024000	We have a lot of video tonight
6024000	6026000	Which is not smart for a radio show
6033000	6035000	It does look very Mega Man-y
6038000	6040000	Those are the boss battles
6040000	6042000	It's different enough
6042000	6044000	If it's a hack, it's a damn good one
6044000	6046000	I mean, maybe they...
6046000	6048000	But this inventory thing, that wouldn't have been in a Mega Man game
6051000	6054000	Well, you technically did have a kind of inventory
6054000	6056000	Yeah, but I don't know
6056000	6058000	I don't see this as much of a hack
6058000	6060000	Just as maybe Mega Man was an inspiration
6060000	6062000	And maybe even some of the
6062000	6064000	Stuff comes from it
6064000	6066000	But I don't know if I'd call it a ROM hack
6066000	6068000	It looks like a ROM hack
6068000	6070000	I guess there's only one way to tell
6070000	6072000	There's some really good ROM hacks out there
6072000	6074000	It looks cool
6074000	6076000	There's a ROM hack of Super Mario Brothers
6076000	6078000	The first one that actually looks completely different
6078000	6080000	And has a lot of new features added into it
6080000	6082000	So...
6082000	6084000	It's very possible that this is just a ROM hack
6084000	6086000	I wouldn't be surprised
6090000	6092000	Sorry, the chat wanted the video there
6092000	6094000	So I'm linking that right there
6094000	6096000	I was having a side conversation with chat
6096000	6098000	And this just popped in my memory
6098000	6100000	Because SSJ100Matt said something about PAX East
6100000	6102000	I did just want to throw that out there
6102000	6104000	I'm just waiting to make sure I can go to PAX's media
6104000	6106000	But I am planning on going
6106000	6108000	I have a couple friends who are actually going from this area
6108000	6110000	Seg, who's been on the show before
6110000	6112000	I know he's going out there
6112000	6114000	And both of us have a friend in common
6114000	6116000	In fact, the friend that introduced us
6116000	6118000	Amanda, is planning on going
6118000	6120000	So I'm going to PAX East with a girl
6120000	6122000	Yay, I'm going to have a date
6122000	6124000	So I am looking at making that happening
6124000	6126000	Sorry, cross the t's and dot the i's
6126000	6128000	Don't dot the t's or I won't be going
6128000	6130000	But as soon as I have all the details on that
6130000	6132000	I'll let you know, but I did promise I would try to make that work
6132000	6134000	And it looks like it's going to happen, yay
6134000	6136000	So
6136000	6138000	Also, in news, other news
6138000	6140000	Talking about ROM hacks
6140000	6142000	Of sorts
6142000	6144000	These are fan translations
6144000	6146000	That I guess are at various
6146000	6148000	Types of stages right now
6148000	6150000	Fatal Frame 4
6150000	6152000	This is a game that was not released over here
6152000	6154000	They're doing a fan translation of it right now
6154000	6156000	And they're talking about doing voiceovers with it
6156000	6158000	Apparently there's a fan translation that
6158000	6160000	Has translated 99% of the text
6160000	6162000	And they're going to do a patch soon
6162000	6164000	So that you can play the game, but apparently now
6164000	6166000	They're not done, they want to start on voiceovers for the game
6166000	6168000	Of course
6168000	6170000	It's going to be by fans, so don't expect it to be
6170000	6172000	A plus caliber stuff, but I don't know
6172000	6174000	It might not be the half bad either
6174000	6176000	So
6176000	6178000	I think that'll be fun to do some voiceovers in games
6178000	6180000	Sometimes though, some of them
6180000	6182000	Do a better job though
6182000	6184000	Than the pros
6184000	6186000	Yeah, that's true, that's true
6186000	6188000	Front Mission 5 is also doing a fan translation
6188000	6190000	And guess what, it's done
6190000	6192000	Front Mission was the
6192000	6194000	2005, there was the fifth game
6194000	6196000	That came out on the Playstation 2
6196000	6198000	And apparently
6198000	6200000	The Front Mission series translation project
6200000	6202000	Has taken this long
6202000	6204000	Thousands of hours, 2000 pages of dialogue
6204000	6206000	To make this game
6206000	6208000	And it is already available
6208000	6210000	And there's even a movie floating around on YouTube
6210000	6212000	Where you can actually check it out and it's been subtitled
6212000	6214000	By the group and everything, that is freaking dedication
6214000	6216000	You know, I remember
6216000	6218000	Many, many years ago when I was in college
6218000	6220000	I think the very, very first
6220000	6222000	Major fan translation project
6222000	6224000	That saw fruition was Final Fantasy V
6224000	6226000	I remember when that came out
6226000	6228000	That was a big freaking deal because it was like
6228000	6230000	Wow, somebody has
6230000	6232000	Done what, you know
6232000	6234000	Square refused to do
6234000	6236000	I remember Seiken 3, also Seiken Densetsu 3
6236000	6238000	That was probably the next big, big one that came out
6238000	6240000	I mean there were some little games in there that didn't have a lot of text
6240000	6242000	But yeah, then Seiken Densetsu 3 was a huge one
6242000	6244000	They came out after that
6244000	6246000	They even went so far as to
6246000	6250000	Translating sprites in the game
6250000	6252000	It's very interesting how far that's come though
6252000	6254000	Because you know, those are all cartridge based things
6254000	6256000	Where you hack sprites and you change
6256000	6258000	You know, some of the coding to change
6258000	6260000	The kanji letters and the American letters and so forth
6260000	6262000	Very interesting how far that's come
6262000	6264000	You're talking about a Playstation 2 game, that's videos and shit
6264000	6266000	That's hardcore
6266000	6268000	No wonder it took so long to do it
6268000	6270000	That is a labor of love
6270000	6272000	No, I agree
6272000	6274000	Something that the company should have just paid some people to do
6274000	6276000	But I guess they didn't want to
6276000	6280000	One more story from Jamie, then Listless
6280000	6282000	Right, in other news
6282000	6284000	This is for our fans of Dragon Quest
6284000	6288000	There is a slime curling game
6288000	6290000	Ooh
6290000	6292000	Basically, it's
6292000	6296000	Going to be out on Nintendo DS
6296000	6300000	And it's basically kind of like slime bowling
6300000	6302000	You know
6302000	6304000	Because it's got
6304000	6306000	Where you sort of guide it through different
6306000	6308000	You know, paths and try to land in the right place
6308000	6310000	And then you've got like a bowling mode
6310000	6312000	It looks like
6312000	6314000	It's just interesting
6316000	6318000	And what a timely release too
6318000	6320000	Because we have the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics coming up
6320000	6322000	Well yeah, this
6322000	6324000	Looks like it might have been influenced
6324000	6326000	I know you're all going to be glued to the tubes
6326000	6328000	To watch curling
6328000	6330000	Exciting stuff
6330000	6332000	That's funny
6332000	6334000	No, actually, as much crap as I give curling
6334000	6336000	It's actually kind of interesting
6336000	6338000	Maybe I'm just weird
6338000	6340000	But it's kind of neat to watch
6340000	6342000	Because sometimes those WTF sports
6342000	6344000	Are kind of
6344000	6346000	I don't know, they make for good watching
6346000	6348000	I'll shut up now
6348000	6350000	Do you think you'd play that game though, the DSi game?
6350000	6352000	No
6352000	6354000	Fine
6354000	6356000	Dark Tetsuya
6356000	6358000	In our chatroom at chat.orangetonshooter.com
6358000	6360000	Says the OLR game could be about curling
6360000	6362000	Yeah, Dark Star
6362000	6364000	Could have the broom
6364000	6366000	Why not?
6366000	6368000	Curler hater
6368000	6370000	That's what you are, you're a curler hater
6370000	6372000	I don't need curlers, I come with enough on my head
6372000	6374000	We are going to
6374000	6376000	Get our friend Bobby Blackwolf
6376000	6378000	On the program right now
6378000	6380000	Because he's going to help us with a little game tonight
6380000	6382000	So we're going to call our good buddy Bobby
6382000	6384000	Hopefully he's standing by
6384000	6386000	We're going to ring him up
6386000	6388000	He's the man who hosts the show before
6388000	6390000	Here on All Games Radio
6390000	6392000	The Bobby Blackwolf Show is live at 5 o'clock Pacific
6392000	6394000	8 o'clock Eastern
6394000	6396000	On Sunday nights right here at All Games Radio
6396000	6398000	Bobby, are you there?
6398000	6400000	I am, how are you guys doing?
6400000	6402000	Good, how are you Bobby?
6402000	6404000	I'm doing good
6404000	6406000	I didn't listen to your show before
6406000	6408000	Something they ought to know is that
6408000	6410000	You always have us on your show every week
6410000	6412000	You kind of do what you call the Daily Show
6412000	6414000	Tease, right?
6414000	6416000	Yeah, exactly
6416000	6418000	Where we get to do our little
6418000	6420000	What's Coming Up on the Colbert Rapport
6420000	6422000	Segment at the end of the Daily Show
6422000	6424000	It's kind of like a toss over there
6424000	6426000	You're always really good to us having us
6426000	6428000	On the show every week, but unfortunately
6428000	6430000	It doesn't really get to work in the reverse
6430000	6432000	Because nobody comes on after us on All Games Radio
6432000	6434000	We rarely get to have you on
6434000	6436000	We do read your comments from chat and so forth
6436000	6438000	But we're glad to have you here with us tonight
6438000	6440000	To help us with the very first list list
6440000	6442000	Of the new decade
6442000	6444000	It's very exciting
6444000	6446000	Now Bobby, for those that have never heard your show before
6446000	6448000	Since you always let us talk about
6448000	6450000	What's Coming Up on Orange Lounge Radio and so forth
6450000	6452000	Tell us a little bit about the Bobby Blackwolf Show
6452000	6454000	In case our listeners have not tuned in yet
6454000	6456000	It's me rambling
6456000	6458000	That's all you need to know
6458000	6460000	You do a really good job selling your show
6460000	6462000	No, it's basically
6462000	6464000	I go through some issues
6464000	6466000	Or things that are going on
6466000	6468000	It's me talking
6468000	6470000	And reading chatroom comments for the first
6470000	6472000	20-25 minutes and then I try to take phone calls
6472000	6474000	From people for the last 25 minutes
6474000	6476000	And then I get to talk to you guys
6476000	6478000	It's basically my take
6478000	6480000	On things that I want to talk about
6480000	6482000	In the games I'm interested in
6482000	6484000	People like listening to it
6484000	6486000	So that's why I keep on doing it
6486000	6488000	And you do this show yourself
6488000	6490000	The Bobby Blackwolf Show
6490000	6492000	So you don't have anybody to really banter with
6492000	6494000	But your listeners
6494000	6496000	And that's a tough job
6496000	6498000	I don't think people realize how difficult that is
6498000	6500000	That means you have to read chat
6500000	6502000	As you're trying to talk sometimes
6502000	6504000	That's tricky
6504000	6506000	Well, no, it's I let dead air happen
6506000	6508000	And then I edit that out of the podcast
6508000	6510000	Whenever I put them up
6510000	6512000	We don't have to tell them the secret
6512000	6514000	But your show is getting some love
6514000	6516000	There in our chatroom from Kitsune
6516000	6518000	Yes, Bobby does a very good show
6518000	6520000	If you get sick of the dick and fart jokes
6520000	6522000	On our show, Bobby's a lot more serious
6522000	6524000	I should point that out
6524000	6526000	Bobby keeps it family friendly on his show
6526000	6528000	And why would you be getting sick of the dick and fart jokes
6528000	6530000	Is what I gotta say
6530000	6532000	I'm saving them for you guys
6532000	6534000	I have no problem with them
6534000	6536000	I choose not to
6536000	6538000	For that hour
6538000	6540000	That's just fine
6540000	6542000	If you want the suitable for broadcast
6542000	6544000	Video game podcast
6544000	6546000	There's tons and tons of shows
6546000	6548000	On the All Games Network
6548000	6550000	And it's growing exponentially
6550000	6552000	So check it out at allgames.com
6552000	6554000	Anyhow, you ready to play Listless tonight?
6554000	6556000	I am
6556000	6558000	Alright, let's do the music
6558000	6560000	Oh, it's been forever since we've had the music
6560000	6562000	For Listless
6562000	6564000	Since it's been forever, I'm gonna explain real quick
6564000	6566000	How Listless works
6566000	6568000	We're gonna put out a topic
6568000	6570000	And then the four of us panelists tonight
6570000	6572000	Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and Bobby Blackwolf
6572000	6574000	Are top three
6574000	6576000	So four times three means we'll have a list of twelve
6576000	6578000	Then comes the tricky part
6578000	6580000	We all go around the room
6580000	6582000	And we eliminate one thing from the list
6582000	6584000	That takes us down to a list of eight
6584000	6586000	Which our chat room will vote on
6586000	6590000	To come up with the definitive list
6590000	6592000	To answer this topic
6592000	6594000	And tonight's topic is
6594000	6598000	The thing I most want to happen in gaming
6598000	6600000	In 2010
6600000	6602000	This can be serious, this can be silly
6602000	6604000	This can be lol worthy, this can be
6604000	6606000	Nobel prize worthy
6606000	6608000	Whatever you want to do
6608000	6610000	It's up to you
6610000	6612000	What you guys think our listeners would want represented
6612000	6614000	Is the thing most wanted in gaming
6614000	6616000	In 2010
6616000	6618000	So Bobby, my friend, I'm gonna let you start
6618000	6620000	You're the guest tonight, we'll let you go first
6620000	6622000	What would be your number three thing
6622000	6624000	You most want to happen in 2010?
6624000	6626000	Number three thing, this is my serious answer
6626000	6630000	And you guys actually did a story on fan translations earlier
6630000	6634000	But I want to see Mother 3 localized and released here
6634000	6636000	Legitimately
6636000	6640000	Mother 3 localized and released legitimately
6640000	6642000	That's a damn good pick
6642000	6644000	That's a hell of a way to start off
6644000	6646000	I think that's something folks have been looking for for a long time
6646000	6648000	So very good
6648000	6650000	By the way, make sure you are in our chat room
6650000	6652000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
6652000	6654000	Because it is the chatters that ultimately take that list of eight
6654000	6656000	And break it down to a list of the top three
6656000	6658000	What a way to start us off
6658000	6660000	A very serious answer there
6660000	6662000	So, Loki, we'll go to you next
6662000	6664000	What would be your number three pick?
6664000	6668000	I don't even know if this would be good
6668000	6670000	But I'm just gonna say it
6670000	6672000	I guess
6672000	6674000	Branthuff Auto 5
6674000	6676000	For Project Intel
6676000	6678000	I don't even know if that would
6678000	6680000	And is that just like
6680000	6682000	I don't even know if I want to do that
6682000	6684000	Is that just the fanboy for Grand Theft Auto
6684000	6686000	And you mixed with the
6686000	6688000	You just really want to be able to slap a hoe for real
6688000	6690000	Is that what it is?
6690000	6692000	You know, that might not be good at all
6692000	6694000	I'm just thinking about that now
6694000	6696000	That might be horrible
6696000	6698000	Do you want to quickly change it?
6698000	6700000	I want to quickly change that
6700000	6702000	Let's find something more appropriate
6702000	6704000	For Project Intel here
6706000	6708000	I think it'd be funny to see that
6708000	6710000	Milo kid become like
6710000	6712000	The actual child sim
6712000	6714000	In Project Intel
6714000	6716000	Because it'd be funny to torture that kid
6716000	6718000	So, Milo becomes sim baby?
6718000	6720000	Or what am I calling this?
6720000	6722000	Sim child
6726000	6728000	I'm so hungry
6728000	6730000	Tough, you're not real
6730000	6732000	Starve
6732000	6734000	Okay, Milo becomes sim child on Intel
6734000	6736000	Okay
6736000	6738000	Loki, did you do your homework before tonight's show?
6738000	6740000	Or are you just doing it in class?
6740000	6742000	Alright
6742000	6744000	Dark Sakura, what is your number 3 pick?
6744000	6746000	A real Silent Hill game
6746000	6748000	Ah, so you're
6748000	6750000	None of this homecoming garbage, huh?
6750000	6752000	No, and even Shattered Memories isn't really
6752000	6754000	Silent Hill, it's more like
6754000	6756000	I don't want to spoil it
6756000	6758000	I see, okay so a real
6758000	6760000	Silent Hill game says Dark Sakura
6760000	6762000	Alright, my number 3 pick
6762000	6764000	Is, funny enough, extremely
6764000	6766000	Similar to what Dark Sakura picked
6766000	6768000	But very different
6768000	6770000	My number 3 pick is also a serious pick
6770000	6772000	I want Akira Yamaoka
6772000	6774000	Now that he's left Konami
6774000	6776000	I want him to start a development studio
6776000	6778000	And announce a new survivor horror franchise
6778000	6780000	I mean, because obviously he can't do Silent Hill
6780000	6782000	If Konami still has that
6782000	6784000	But I would like to see Akira Yamaoka
6784000	6786000	Start a development studio
6786000	6788000	And announce a new survival horror franchise
6788000	6790000	Um, Loki, is that a game you'd like to see happen?
6790000	6792000	Or what?
6792000	6794000	Um
6794000	6796000	I don't know
6796000	6798000	Maybe with the creepy bunny
6798000	6800000	We need more games with the creepy bunny
6800000	6802000	Fine, more games with the creepy bunny
6802000	6804000	Alright, uh, Bobby
6804000	6806000	We now have set our number 3 picks
6806000	6808000	We're up to number 2, so what would you like to see?
6808000	6810000	Your number 2 thing you most want to see happen in gaming this year
6810000	6812000	I want to see this
6812000	6814000	And I know everybody out there
6814000	6816000	Will agree
6816000	6818000	Eye of Judgment finally sells
6818000	6820000	1 million units
6820000	6822000	They'd have to actually start manufacturing them again
6822000	6824000	But, hey, he can do anything he wants
6824000	6826000	Alright
6826000	6828000	Maybe they will have a new game this year
6828000	6830000	Or something
6830000	6832000	Where the interest in the old game
6832000	6834000	Just comes back
6834000	6836000	Like Valkyria Chronicles
6836000	6838000	Took like 6 months to catch on
6838000	6840000	So maybe this is like that
6840000	6842000	Where
6842000	6844000	It takes 6 years to catch on
6844000	6846000	It's fine
6846000	6848000	If it goes into best hits, Loki
6848000	6850000	Those best hits copies are going to count
6850000	6852000	Because it's still the same game
6852000	6854000	So Eye of Judgment is very true
6854000	6856000	Alright, so we got something
6856000	6858000	It's never going to happen because it has to sell a million copies
6858000	6860000	Well, Loki
6860000	6862000	It's what I want, that's what it's about
6862000	6864000	That's right, it's what we all want, dammit
6864000	6866000	You better get your wife starting on that
6866000	6868000	Tingle outfit, that's all I'm saying
6868000	6870000	He isn't so
6870000	6872000	Loki, fine then, what do you want as your number 2
6872000	6874000	Thing you most want to see happen this year?
6874000	6876000	President Cat
6876000	6878000	For Wii
6878000	6880000	Amen to that, President Cat localization
6880000	6882000	Finally announced for the Wii
6882000	6884000	That's something we've been bitching about for months and months
6884000	6886000	Bobby, you weren't even here when that happened
6886000	6888000	Think of the merchandise
6888000	6890000	I mean, the merchandising alone
6890000	6892000	You'd make a killing
6892000	6894000	I hope, I hope by some act of
6894000	6896000	I don't know what
6896000	6898000	Seriously, think about it
6898000	6900000	Look at like, um, like Invader Zim
6900000	6902000	Off TV, but they sell merchandise
6902000	6904000	Out the ass, it's just like
6904000	6906000	Crazy
6906000	6908000	Can I just point this out, I hope by some act of
6908000	6910000	I don't know what, we get invited
6910000	6912000	In Nintendo's press conference at E3 this year
6912000	6914000	And somehow through another act of
6914000	6916000	I don't know what, lol, haha
6916000	6918000	That is actually announced by Reggie
6918000	6920000	On stage, listen carefully
6920000	6922000	For the cackling from the audience
6922000	6924000	Because it'll be me
6924000	6926000	Losing my shit
6926000	6928000	In the audience, just so you know
6928000	6930000	Okay, Dark Sakura
6930000	6932000	If we got invited by Nintendo
6932000	6934000	To present President Cat coming to America
6934000	6936000	On stage with Reggie
6936000	6938000	I would be there with a Tingle costume on
6938000	6940000	It would never happen
6940000	6942000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on
6942000	6944000	Hold on, stop the music, stop it
6944000	6946000	Stop it right now
6946000	6948000	Did I just hear you correctly?
6948000	6950000	Yes, because it will never happen
6950000	6952000	There is a back door to winning the Tingle bet
6952000	6954000	Apparently, I know, I'm happy about this
6954000	6956000	I know, I'm just, there is a back door now
6956000	6958000	If we get invited by Nintendo
6958000	6960000	To announce President Cat on stage
6960000	6962000	Loki will do it in a Tingle costume
6962000	6964000	What that has to do with President Cat
6964000	6966000	I don't fucking know
6966000	6968000	But this now has to happen
6968000	6970000	It will never happen
6970000	6972000	They used GPD for some of their other stuff
6972000	6974000	At previous press conferences
6974000	6976000	It could happen
6976000	6978000	I will shave my head and tan a lot
6978000	6980000	And I'll look like GPD
6980000	6982000	If that's what it takes
6982000	6984000	Okay, back to the music
6984000	6986000	Dark Sakura, your number two pick for me
6986000	6988000	Trauma, Trauma
6988000	6990000	Oh, okay, so by proxy
6990000	6992000	That's okay, it's your list, do what you want with it
6992000	6994000	Keytar Hero
6994000	6996000	With a Q?
6996000	6998000	No, it's
6998000	7000000	The keytar
7000000	7002000	The keyboard
7002000	7004000	Oh, okay, got it, got it
7004000	7006000	Yeah
7006000	7008000	And who would be the featured artist in Keytar Hero?
7008000	7010000	Elton John
7010000	7012000	Alright, fine, Keytar Hero
7012000	7014000	Alright
7014000	7016000	That's the number two thing
7016000	7018000	I would like to see happen
7018000	7020000	Actually, funny enough, it has to do with Nintendo at E3
7020000	7022000	The number two thing I would like to see happen this year
7022000	7024000	Is I want Reggie to apologize
7024000	7026000	At E3
7026000	7028000	And then for effect, punch a kid in the face
7028000	7030000	Yes
7030000	7032000	Just to show that they are not about
7032000	7034000	The kids anymore
7034000	7036000	Reggie's gonna come out on stage and say, I am sorry
7036000	7038000	That we've lost our focus
7038000	7040000	And then to prove it, he's gonna punch
7040000	7042000	A kid in the face
7042000	7044000	That's the number two thing I want to see happen this year
7044000	7046000	Wouldn't you like to see that happen, Loki?
7046000	7048000	Sure
7048000	7050000	I guess
7050000	7052000	What a weird
7052000	7054000	The face!
7054000	7056000	Yes, and actually
7056000	7058000	I'm not gonna put this on the list
7058000	7060000	But Loki could punch the child
7060000	7062000	In his tingle outfit
7062000	7064000	Hey, I would be down with it
7064000	7066000	I know you would be
7066000	7068000	Alright
7068000	7070000	So, so far, just to let you know
7070000	7072000	Where we're at in case you're just joining us
7072000	7074000	The list so far, thing we most want to see in 2010
7074000	7076000	Mother 3 localized and released
7076000	7078000	Milo becomes sim child on Natal
7078000	7080000	A real Silent Hill game
7080000	7082000	Akira Yamaoka starts his studio
7082000	7084000	Does a new horror game
7084000	7086000	Eye of Judgment sells one million copies
7086000	7088000	President Kat for the Wii
7088000	7090000	Keytar Hero
7090000	7092000	And Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face
7092000	7094000	Alright, so now this is it
7094000	7096000	The number one thing you want to see happen
7096000	7098000	In gaming this year
7098000	7100000	Bobby, what is it? Number one
7100000	7102000	Game companies everywhere
7102000	7104000	Realize that first person shooters
7104000	7106000	Are oversaturating the market
7106000	7108000	And begin to turn all those franchises
7108000	7110000	Into dating sims
7110000	7112000	I approve
7112000	7114000	That's a good one
7114000	7116000	I'm gonna have to shorten that
7116000	7118000	So I'm gonna put first person shooters
7118000	7120000	Turned into dating sims
7120000	7122000	But you all know what Bobby means
7122000	7124000	What would be at the top of your list
7124000	7126000	For that?
7126000	7128000	Well, some about the
7128000	7130000	Pink Spartan in Halo
7130000	7132000	Romancing her
7132000	7134000	I see, okay, so first person shooters
7134000	7136000	Turned into dating sims, I like that
7136000	7138000	Alright, number one answer
7138000	7140000	Loki, what would be your number one answer?
7140000	7142000	I don't really have anything
7142000	7144000	That I could go with
7144000	7146000	I guess
7146000	7148000	I didn't do my homework
7148000	7150000	So
7150000	7152000	They do yell things in chat
7152000	7154000	But I'm not reading chat
7154000	7156000	Holodeck
7156000	7158000	No, that's never gonna happen
7158000	7160000	Gaming gets closer and closer to the holodeck
7160000	7162000	But it's like the limit
7162000	7164000	You get close to one, but you never reach
7164000	7166000	One, that's what it is
7166000	7168000	Yeah, okay
7168000	7170000	Let's see, something I wish
7170000	7172000	Would happen
7174000	7176000	I hope
7176000	7178000	Sony has another press conference
7178000	7180000	That sparks a bunch of
7180000	7182000	Wonderful memes again
7182000	7184000	Like Ridge Racer, in fact, I hope they have
7184000	7186000	A giant enemy crab come out on stage
7186000	7188000	To announce a game for Sony
7190000	7192000	You know, the beat in on the joke
7192000	7194000	Or their next concert will be shaped like a giant enemy crab
7194000	7196000	That'd be funny
7196000	7198000	Okay, since you need to pick one thing, I'm gonna say
7198000	7200000	Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference
7200000	7202000	Like actually comes out on stage and presents something
7202000	7204000	In a tuxedo
7204000	7206000	I'm not writing that
7206000	7208000	But you'll just know it's there, fine
7208000	7210000	Alright, Dark Sakura
7210000	7212000	It's your turn
7212000	7214000	What's the Uno thing you most want to happen in gaming
7214000	7216000	In 2010?
7216000	7218000	Half Life 2 Episode 3
7218000	7220000	With the portal gun
7220000	7222000	About fucking time, huh
7222000	7224000	Well, it's supposed to come out anyway
7224000	7226000	But I want the portal gun in it
7226000	7228000	Alright, a somewhat serious one
7228000	7230000	Folks have been looking for this for a long time
7230000	7232000	Half Life 2 and Episode 3
7232000	7234000	Dude, they're gonna have the Borealis in it
7234000	7236000	Which is the Aperture ship
7236000	7238000	Where's my portal gun?
7238000	7240000	They should just have a mashup game
7240000	7242000	With the different Valve franchises together
7242000	7244000	Like you hit the portal gun with zombies
7244000	7246000	And you know, the Team Fortress 2 guys
7246000	7248000	Garry's Mod
7248000	7250000	That'd be awesome
7250000	7252000	But if Bobby's thing stays too
7252000	7254000	Then Half Life 2 will become a dating sim
7254000	7256000	So I'm not sure, with the portal gun
7256000	7258000	So I'm not sure how that's gonna work
7258000	7260000	But it's gonna be funny
7260000	7262000	This date sucks
7262000	7264000	Quick exit
7266000	7268000	I like where this is going
7268000	7270000	Be going
7272000	7274000	Okay, my number one thing
7274000	7276000	I have somewhat a controversial answer
7276000	7278000	But man, I would just
7278000	7280000	This would just make me so happy
7280000	7282000	Like, I would just
7282000	7284000	I would cry tears of joy
7284000	7286000	Would you pee with happiness?
7286000	7288000	Maybe, but you know, in the toilet
7288000	7290000	Cause that's dirty otherwise
7290000	7292000	I would just be so happy if this would actually happen
7292000	7294000	The number one thing I would most like to see happen
7294000	7296000	In gaming in 2010
7296000	7298000	Is X-Play gets cancelled
7298000	7300000	Thank you very much
7300000	7302000	That would be sweet
7302000	7304000	Not that bad
7306000	7308000	I was gonna say that G4 gets cancelled altogether
7308000	7310000	And replaced with a Seacrest network
7310000	7312000	But I'm just-
7312000	7314000	I have to feel sorry for X-Play
7314000	7316000	Because they were part of Tech TV at one time
7316000	7318000	And so I hate to see the last bit of good
7318000	7320000	You know, Tech TV
7320000	7322000	Die off
7322000	7324000	But
7324000	7326000	I just have to admit
7326000	7328000	I'm just done with the reviews
7328000	7330000	I'd like to see him return to
7330000	7332000	Say a out of ten
7332000	7334000	Scale instead of out of five
7336000	7338000	I give Sky's answer
7338000	7340000	Three out of five
7340000	7342000	Very nice
7342000	7344000	Bobby, I've copy pasted the list for you there
7344000	7346000	Now is the hard part
7346000	7348000	This is the part where we're gonna go around and eliminate things from the list
7348000	7350000	No hard feelings everyone
7350000	7352000	This is just a part of the process
7352000	7354000	Okay, so let me again recap
7354000	7356000	The twelve items on our list
7356000	7358000	That the chatters will soon vote on
7358000	7360000	As we reduce this to eight
7360000	7362000	Mother 3 localized and released
7362000	7364000	Milo becomes Sim Child on Atoll
7364000	7366000	A real Silent Hill game
7366000	7368000	Akira Yomoka starts the studio and does a new horror game
7368000	7370000	Eye of Judgment sells one million copies
7370000	7372000	President Kat on the Wii
7372000	7374000	Ki-tar Hero
7374000	7376000	Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face
7376000	7378000	First person shooters turn into dating sims
7378000	7380000	Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference
7380000	7382000	And X-Play gets cancelled
7382000	7384000	Bobby, unfortunately it's part of the game
7384000	7386000	One of these has to go
7386000	7388000	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7390000	7392000	Just because I'm not into those games
7392000	7394000	The Silent Hill thing's gotta go
7394000	7396000	The real Silent Hill game?
7396000	7398000	Yep
7398000	7400000	Alright, so sadly Bobby has said
7400000	7402000	Nah, I'm done with Silent Hill
7402000	7404000	A real Silent Hill game has been eliminated from the list
7404000	7406000	Alright
7406000	7408000	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7408000	7410000	The Eye of Judgment sells a million copies
7410000	7412000	It's never gonna happen
7412000	7414000	Ever
7414000	7416000	Get over it already?
7418000	7420000	Ah, sorry Bobby
7420000	7422000	You know what, for what it's worth Bobby
7422000	7424000	I really like that answer, that was good
7424000	7426000	Alright, but unfortunately Loki has deemed it unworthy of the list
7426000	7428000	And therefore it is gone
7428000	7430000	Dark Sakura, which of these
7430000	7432000	Is not worthy of the list?
7432000	7434000	First person shooters turn into dating sims
7434000	7436000	Oh
7436000	7438000	Why don't we bring Bobby on the show
7438000	7440000	If we're just gonna eliminate all his answers
7440000	7442000	Because
7442000	7444000	Dating sims are
7444000	7446000	All you have to do is just go to Japan
7446000	7448000	Everything's a dating sim
7448000	7450000	Poor Bobby, I'm sorry Bobby
7450000	7452000	For what it's worth Bobby, I'm gonna leave your last one on there
7452000	7454000	Cause I liked it
7454000	7456000	The one I am gonna eliminate though
7456000	7458000	The one that I think is not worthy of the list
7458000	7460000	Milo becomes sim child on Natal
7460000	7462000	Because I don't even think Loki knew what that answer was
7462000	7464000	So that's the one I'm eliminating from the list
7464000	7466000	Just a way to torture
7466000	7468000	That virtual kid
7468000	7470000	Which actually if I think about it
7470000	7472000	I'm sure they're included in some sort of
7472000	7474000	Fable game and I'll do just the same
7474000	7476000	In that, so
7476000	7478000	Alright, here it is
7478000	7480000	The eight that the chat room does get to vote on
7480000	7482000	Remember chatters, when you vote
7482000	7484000	Damn, I should have said Peter Molyneaux jumps into a volcano
7484000	7486000	That would have been better
7486000	7488000	See, I wouldn't have eliminated that
7488000	7490000	Alright, here it is though, these are the list
7490000	7492000	As it stands
7492000	7494000	Mother 3 localized and released
7494000	7496000	Akira Yamaoka starts a studio
7496000	7498000	And does a new horror game
7498000	7500000	President Kat is on the Wii
7500000	7502000	Ki-tar hero
7502000	7504000	Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face
7504000	7506000	Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference
7506000	7508000	Half Life 2 Episode 3
7508000	7510000	Is finally released with a portal gun
7510000	7512000	And X-Play gets cancelled
7512000	7514000	To vote, send a private message to Sky
7514000	7516000	With your number one
7516000	7518000	And your number two answer
7518000	7520000	If you don't label what's one and two
7520000	7522000	I'm going to just assume the first one
7522000	7524000	Is your number one choice
7524000	7526000	So place your vote now
7526000	7528000	And we will tell you what the top two
7528000	7530000	Sorry, top three were
7530000	7532000	A little later in the show
7532000	7534000	And no, Bobby, stop telling the chatters
7534000	7536000	To add Dating Sims
7536000	7538000	That's just the way the game works
7538000	7540000	It's no longer on the list
7540000	7542000	But nothing
7542000	7544000	Bobby, thank you so much though
7544000	7546000	For playing the list tonight
7546000	7548000	I think the Mother 3 one especially
7548000	7550000	Was a good one that I completely forgot about
7550000	7552000	I am behind that too
7552000	7554000	Isn't it funny your serious answer
7554000	7556000	Was the one that gets through
7556000	7558000	Bobby, any other quick plugs for what's going on
7558000	7560000	In your life, you do another show
7560000	7562000	On Friday nights, tell us about that real quick
7562000	7564000	Before I let you go
7564000	7566000	It's called Friday Night Gaming, it's an actual video show
7566000	7568000	In the sense that we actually
7568000	7570000	Have three cameras, we do it from
7570000	7572000	An independent game store
7572000	7574000	Here in the Atlanta area and we basically
7574000	7576000	Play a game
7576000	7578000	We live on the air, we stream it out
7578000	7580000	Sometimes we'll even play it online
7580000	7582000	I think this week we're going to be doing Bayonetta
7582000	7584000	As our welcome back in 2010
7584000	7586000	It's an audio podcast
7586000	7588000	But it doesn't really work as well
7588000	7590000	Because it's very video heavy
7590000	7592000	But we do it over on Ustream for three hours on Friday nights
7592000	7594000	Fnglive.net
7594000	7596000	We also take phone calls
7596000	7598000	We have the chat room
7598000	7600000	It's basically an extension of what I do on Sundays
7600000	7602000	But a little bit more free form
7602000	7604000	And there are dick and fart jokes in it
7604000	7606000	On a Friday night, so very good
7606000	7608000	And you get a whole weekend because then on Saturday night
7608000	7610000	They do a lot of dick and fart jokes too
7610000	7612000	So you can get it all through your weekend
7612000	7614000	Excellent
7614000	7616000	Well, Bobby, thank you so much for joining us tonight
7616000	7618000	Best of luck with your shows
7618000	7620000	And we'll let you know what happens with the list
7620000	7622000	Alright, thank you
7622000	7624000	Dating sims for everyone
7624000	7626000	Alright, take care Bobby
7626000	7628000	Maybe in 2011
7628000	7630000	Alright, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf
7630000	7632000	Who hosts his own show
7632000	7634000	Right before us here on
7634000	7636000	All Games Radio
7636000	7638000	That's about going to take us to calls
7638000	7640000	And so forth, but not until
7640000	7642000	We do a very important
7642000	7644000	Segment of our show while I tally up
7644000	7646000	The listless votes
7646000	7648000	It's the part of the show where you guys
7648000	7650000	Send us emails and we pick a few
7650000	7652000	Of our favorites and read them for you guys
7652000	7654000	It's the mailbag segment
7654000	7656000	Dark Sakura
7656000	7658000	What kind of emails do we have this week?
7658000	7660000	Just one
7660000	7662000	One good one I hope
7662000	7664000	Well, we shall see if it's good
7664000	7666000	Just going to take me a moment to get it
7666000	7668000	Pulled up
7668000	7670000	That's all
7670000	7672000	It is
7672000	7674000	I'll just start from the beginning
7674000	7676000	Dear gamers and OLR crew
7676000	7678000	I'm not going to read the beginning of this
7678000	7680000	You were right about the 360
7680000	7682000	It is gaming heaven
7682000	7684000	I've never been this immersed in a game
7684000	7686000	Since Pokemon Gold on a 15 hour
7686000	7688000	Road trip with constant grinding
7688000	7690000	Level 100
7690000	7692000	The three days before I went to the store
7692000	7694000	I was constantly switching games on my PSP
7694000	7696000	Since I decided to kick the Wii out of the
7696000	7698000	Gaming cave
7698000	7700000	I was switching between GTA and Rainbow Six Vegas
7700000	7702000	And Final Fantasy 6
7702000	7704000	I finally went to the store
7704000	7706000	A local chain called Gamers
7706000	7708000	To get the used Xbox 360 Pro
7708000	7710000	With a 20 GB hard drive
7710000	7712000	I knew what I was jumping into
7712000	7714000	With the problems the system had
7714000	7716000	So I got a 2 year extended warranty
7716000	7718000	In the name of being the MLG
7718000	7720000	Like Tom T-Squared Taylor
7720000	7722000	Whatever
7722000	7724000	I picked up Halo 3
7724000	7726000	In the interest of getting some
7726000	7728000	Headbanging done
7728000	7730000	While whaling on my plastic axe
7730000	7732000	I got Guitar Hero Metallica
7732000	7734000	With some Xbox Live Points
7734000	7736000	A 1600 prepaid card
7736000	7738000	I've played Halo 3 for 15 days
7738000	7740000	And it was awesome
7740000	7742000	I've also played Guitar Hero Metallica
7742000	7744000	And gotten the easy achievements all the way first
7744000	7746000	I had to fix it for a few hours
7746000	7748000	And I'm having massive fun with this
7748000	7750000	And my TV had no lag
7750000	7752000	And was able to set it up to 1080i
7752000	7754000	And then I popped in
7754000	7756000	Bring It On and Death Note into the DVD drive
7756000	7758000	And it upscaled the DVD
7758000	7760000	To 1080i resolution
7760000	7762000	My anime has never looked so good
7762000	7764000	Thank you Microsoft for creating the Jesus Box
7764000	7766000	Now the only three things missing
7766000	7768000	To make my purchase complete
7768000	7770000	Is a wireless adapter, 12 month gold
7770000	7772000	And a headset
7772000	7774000	This is the eyes of President Cat
7774000	7776000	It's purrrfect
7776000	7778000	Peace out DS Master 26
7778000	7780000	P.S. This email is sponsored by
7780000	7782000	Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato
7782000	7784000	The hottest teen stars
7784000	7786000	I wish I'd be going out with
7786000	7788000	All three from Disney, oh by the way
7788000	7790000	Leave Miley alone and don't criticize her, she's perfect
7790000	7792000	I can't believe I just said that
7792000	7794000	I know, I'm like
7794000	7796000	Did you really just say that on air?
7796000	7798000	Bite my ass
7798000	7800000	Read the damn email
7800000	7802000	Alright, so I only like
7802000	7804000	Half heard that email because I'm
7804000	7806000	Tallying the votes, so
7806000	7808000	Are there questions for us in there or what?
7808000	7810000	I'm seeing if there's anything else in here, no
7812000	7814000	I would though
7814000	7816000	Now I need to remember what type of
7816000	7818000	Headset that we have
7818000	7820000	Because Dan has these cool
7820000	7822000	Like I could sit next to him
7822000	7824000	And not hear the Xbox at all headphones
7824000	7826000	They're amazing
7826000	7828000	They help me sleep at night
7828000	7830000	It's the best present he's ever gotten me
7830000	7832000	Well technically it's the best present he's ever
7832000	7834000	Bought in himself for me
7834000	7836000	I do have though
7836000	7838000	A little story I could throw in the interim
7838000	7840000	Sure, but let me just quickly say
7840000	7842000	Last call for listless votes
7842000	7844000	You guys have one minute to get your listless votes in
7844000	7846000	Or they will not be counted, one minute for listless votes
7846000	7848000	Very heavy participation tonight
7848000	7850000	We're gonna have a good list tonight
7850000	7852000	Well, what was going on is
7852000	7854000	Basically these
7854000	7856000	Geeks
7856000	7858000	Team Osaka, from the University of Osaka
7858000	7860000	Submitted
7860000	7862000	To the
7862000	7864000	2009 internationally genetically engineered
7864000	7866000	Machine competition
7866000	7868000	These
7868000	7870000	Engineered bacteria
7870000	7872000	That produce fluorescent proteins
7872000	7874000	And
7874000	7876000	Crotonoid pigments
7876000	7878000	To make art out of them
7878000	7880000	And they made one
7880000	7882000	Look like Mario
7882000	7884000	They were calling them
7884000	7886000	Biobricks
7886000	7888000	So uh
7888000	7890000	There's a picture of Mario
7890000	7892000	Made out of bacteria
7892000	7894000	It's bacteria
7894000	7896000	That's freaky
7896000	7898000	Genetically engineered bacteria
7898000	7900000	I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room
7900000	7902000	I make genetically engineered
7902000	7904000	Next gen
7904000	7906000	Biobricks
7906000	7908000	They're kinda murky and brown though
7908000	7914000	Stop being gross
7914000	7916000	Alright, we're gonna get to the FUs of the week in just a moment here
7916000	7918000	But I was just putting the final touches there
7918000	7920000	On tonight's listless
7920000	7922000	Ooh, damn it
7922000	7924000	Right after I get them all tallied up
7924000	7926000	One more freaking vote comes in
7926000	7928000	Damn you!
7928000	7930000	Ok, so that's uh
7930000	7932000	Live radio folks, what can you do?
7932000	7934000	That's another vote for the number one answer
7934000	7936000	So that's not really gonna change things too much
7936000	7938000	Ah
7938000	7940000	Sorry, live radio folks
7940000	7942000	We will get to the FUs in just a minute
7942000	7944000	I posted the bacteria Mario
7950000	7952000	Alright
7952000	7954000	We'll get to the listless results in just a moment
7954000	7956000	But we are first gonna get to the FUs of the week
7956000	7958000	And we actually have some angst
7958000	7960000	To inspire our FUs of the week
7960000	7962000	But before we can start ranting
7962000	7964000	We need to get our ranty music
7964000	7966000	So please, shligework, take us away
7982000	7984000	Here's something to inspire your ranting tonight
7984000	7986000	In the gaming world
7986000	7988000	It's another case of the media runs away
7988000	7990000	With some idiot
7990000	7992000	Doing something with video games
7992000	7994000	To make the media run away with games are bad
7994000	7996000	Ok?
7996000	7998000	A nine year old boy apparently stabbed to death
7998000	8000000	By a 25 year old friend
8000000	8002000	Over a game of Tony Hawk
8002000	8004000	You see, Anthony
8004000	8006000	Maldonado was visiting
8006000	8008000	His family in Harlem
8008000	8010000	And they were playing the new Playstation
8010000	8012000	And uh, the killer's name was
8012000	8014000	Alejandro Morales, the 25 year old I suppose
8014000	8016000	The boy's family left the
8016000	8018000	Nine year old in the care of Alejandro
8018000	8020000	During the night while they were playing the Tony Hawk
8020000	8022000	Game, and that's when he stabbed him in the chest
8024000	8026000	The story goes on to say
8026000	8028000	He was a friend, I can't believe this happened
8028000	8030000	Da da da, Anthony was playing on Playstation
8030000	8032000	When his friend came in and stabbed him
8032000	8034000	My grandson died over a video game
8034000	8036000	Um, I'm not so sure your grandson
8036000	8038000	Died over a video game, it's just that you left
8038000	8040000	Him under the care of a fucking lunatic
8040000	8042000	And to be fair, you may not have known
8042000	8044000	He was a fucking lunatic
8044000	8046000	That's very tragic that he ended up being a fucking lunatic
8046000	8048000	But something tells me
8048000	8050000	It really has nothing to do with video games
8050000	8052000	This guy, Alejandro
8052000	8054000	Was just kind of
8054000	8056000	A fucking lunatic
8058000	8060000	Don't say my name
8060000	8062000	Don't say my name, Alejandro
8062000	8064000	People are disgusting
8064000	8066000	Anyhow, as if that didn't make you angry enough
8066000	8068000	DarkSakura, what is your FU of the week?
8068000	8070000	Um
8070000	8072000	My FU of the week is being
8072000	8074000	Really, really freaking exhausted
8074000	8076000	For no real reason
8076000	8078000	Because, well I thought it was
8078000	8080000	Related to some of my vitamins
8080000	8082000	But, I've taken my vitamins
8082000	8084000	And I feel, you know, still tired
8084000	8086000	So I'm just extra exhausted
8086000	8088000	Yeah
8088000	8090000	Loki?
8090000	8092000	FU to KFC for leaving me
8092000	8094000	At the drive-thru window for about ten minutes
8094000	8096000	While they
8096000	8098000	Jacked off, I assume
8098000	8100000	Because, um, then the manager
8100000	8102000	The manager comes over and says, has anyone come and helped you?
8102000	8104000	I'm like, no, I've been sitting here for ten minutes
8104000	8106000	He's like, oh shit, sorry
8106000	8108000	Uh, here's your food
8108000	8110000	I'm not gonna charge you for the whole thing
8110000	8112000	Oh, well how nice
8112000	8114000	Well, except I think he did, so
8114000	8116000	Whatever
8116000	8118000	You didn't even get a free cookie for your troubles?
8118000	8120000	No, but the chicken was good
8120000	8122000	So it is forgiven
8122000	8124000	All is forgiven
8124000	8126000	Uh, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week
8126000	8128000	Just FU'd my car for being ghetto
8128000	8130000	It's so ghetto
8130000	8132000	I will have a new car soon
8132000	8134000	I have to, I really don't have a choice at this point
8134000	8136000	So I FU'd my car
8136000	8138000	You do have a choice, Rob
8138000	8140000	There's always a choice
8140000	8142000	I do, I do, but it's starting to get
8142000	8144000	There is public transportation, Rob
8144000	8146000	It's getting to borderline pathetic
8146000	8148000	I don't live in a city that has
8148000	8150000	Very good public transportation
8150000	8152000	I don't live in New York, I don't live in
8152000	8154000	DC
8154000	8156000	I live in Sacramento
8156000	8158000	That is really
8158000	8160000	About it for what we had scripted
8160000	8162000	For tonight's show
8162000	8164000	So we're going to go ahead and turn it over to
8164000	8166000	Last minute stories right after
8166000	8168000	I tell you who won the list list tonight
8174000	8176000	Here it is, as voted by you the chatters
8176000	8178000	The definitive, and this is it
8178000	8180000	There is no arguing
8180000	8182000	There is no disputing, this is the definitive list
8182000	8184000	Of what the public wants in the year 2010 in gaming
8184000	8186000	Number three
8186000	8188000	Is they want Reggie
8188000	8190000	To apologize at E3
8190000	8192000	And then punch a kid in the face
8192000	8194000	So we all know he means it
8194000	8196000	It's the only way
8196000	8198000	It's the only way, I won't believe him otherwise
8198000	8200000	Number two
8200000	8202000	And I don't want to hear any of this
8202000	8204000	Blah blah blah, but it's a child
8204000	8206000	Blah blah blah
8206000	8208000	Just trust me, there's lots of kids out there
8208000	8210000	You've wanted to punch in the face
8210000	8212000	Get a parent to sign off on it
8212000	8214000	Number two
8214000	8216000	The number two thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010
8216000	8218000	Mother three
8218000	8220000	Is localized and released
8220000	8222000	So Bobby gets the last laugh after all
8222000	8224000	He ends up on the list there
8224000	8226000	Mother three is localized and released is the number two answer
8226000	8228000	On our list tonight
8228000	8230000	And the number one thing you most want to see
8230000	8232000	Happen in the year 2010
8232000	8234000	According to our chatters
8234000	8236000	President Cat
8236000	8238000	Is finally released on the Wii
8238000	8240000	Woooo
8240000	8242000	No surprise there, and by the way
8242000	8244000	I just want to point out it wasn't even a freaking close vote
8244000	8246000	Tonight, like usually these list lists are kind of close
8246000	8248000	President Cat won in a landslide vote
8248000	8250000	I have a feeling though
8250000	8252000	The chat room might be thinking
8252000	8254000	That that means that then
8254000	8256000	We would actually announce it at E3
8256000	8258000	And Loki would wear the tingle costume
8258000	8260000	Which technically wasn't part of the answer
8260000	8262000	But I just really like that
8262000	8264000	And maybe that's what they were voting number one
8264000	8266000	Does it give you the warm fuzzies?
8266000	8268000	It does, it does, and we'll see
8268000	8270000	Hopefully this will be the year for President Cat
8270000	8272000	100 copies my ass
8272000	8274000	That's all I have to say
8274000	8276000	Only 100 copies sold, come on
8276000	8278000	Come on
8278000	8280000	Alright
8280000	8282000	So there you go
8282000	8284000	There's your definitive top three list as voted by the chatters
8284000	8286000	Bobby is still trying to dispute the dating sims thing in chat
8286000	8288000	Let it go
8288000	8290000	Let it go
8290000	8292000	Step away
8292000	8294000	Let it be
8294000	8296000	Alright now we'll do some last minute stories
8296000	8298000	And we'll open up the Skype line
8298000	8300000	1877 Game OLR
8300000	8302000	Challenge Radio
8302000	8304000	We'll get to your calls right after some last minute stories
8304000	8306000	Loki
8306000	8308000	Love the procedurally generated MMO
8308000	8310000	Is starting off with some beta testing
8310000	8312000	And that's coming to us
8312000	8314000	I guess on January 7th
8314000	8316000	Until that time I guess
8316000	8318000	Only registrants in the pay-to-play alpha test
8318000	8320000	Can log on though unfortunately
8320000	8322000	But
8322000	8324000	That's kind of neat though
8324000	8326000	The game looks interesting though
8326000	8328000	Because it's all procedurally generated
8328000	8330000	We'll get to a call, save that thought
8330000	8332000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8332000	8334000	It's Ray Iyanami
8334000	8336000	Hi, we're having a hard time hearing you
8336000	8338000	Make sure you're speaking loud and clear into the phone, who's this?
8338000	8340000	It's Ray Iyanami
8340000	8342000	Much better
8342000	8344000	Ray, what's on your mind buddy?
8344000	8346000	Not much
8346000	8348000	I got my Christmas money
8348000	8350000	Like last week
8350000	8352000	So I've been spending it on some games
8352000	8354000	Like Raiden 4 and
8354000	8356000	Jordan Masters Twinkle
8356000	8358000	You've been playing Raiden 4 and what?
8360000	8362000	Jordan Masters Twinkle
8362000	8364000	Basically it's a
8364000	8366000	Xbox Live Indie Game
8366000	8368000	Sport of a PC game called
8368000	8370000	Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter
8372000	8374000	Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter
8374000	8376000	Interesting, what was the name of the PC game you dropped out there for a minute there?
8376000	8378000	It's based on what?
8378000	8380000	The original PC game
8380000	8382000	is called Jordan Masters
8382000	8384000	How much
8384000	8386000	How much did it set you back?
8386000	8388000	400 Microsoft points
8388000	8390000	or 5 US dollars
8390000	8392000	Gotcha
8392000	8394000	So that's what's going on in your gaming world
8394000	8396000	You've had a chance to catch up on a lot of stuff
8396000	8398000	over the holidays?
8398000	8400000	Yeah
8400000	8404000	I also got
8404000	8406000	Admittedly
8406000	8408000	Part of the reason I wanted to get it was because
8408000	8410000	it doesn't have the stupid autocorrect feature
8410000	8412000	of the newer DJMax games
8412000	8414000	If you hit the wrong note
8414000	8416000	it'll give you credit for the note
8420000	8422000	And I was able to log
8422000	8424000	all the talks in it like within a few days
8424000	8426000	and nothing too difficult
8426000	8428000	and the charts are pretty easy
8428000	8430000	but then again this is a game
8430000	8432000	of characterless new players
8432000	8434000	so I don't hold a grudge against
8434000	8436000	Pentavision for that
8436000	8438000	Now you sent us
8438000	8440000	You tweeted us about the whole
8440000	8442000	DJMax Technica thing going on
8442000	8444000	What is kind of else's new in the
8444000	8446000	DJMax world? Like are they still supporting
8446000	8448000	that arcade game? I mean the arcade game is very different
8448000	8450000	than the home version of the game
8450000	8452000	Have you heard of any plans
8452000	8454000	to give that arcade experience at home
8454000	8456000	or what?
8456000	8458000	I haven't heard anything
8458000	8460000	and
8460000	8462000	even if there were plans to make
8462000	8464000	a Technica port for home
8464000	8466000	it would be really hard considering
8466000	8468000	the setup of the arcade game
8468000	8470000	If you were to put on DS
8470000	8472000	you would have to dump that
8472000	8474000	experience in because DS can't support
8474000	8476000	more than two fingerprints at once
8476000	8478000	Do you think
8478000	8480000	it might work on a motion control type thing?
8480000	8482000	Like maybe if it was pointing at the screen
8482000	8484000	like on the Wii or Natal or something
8484000	8486000	or is that going to just change it too much?
8486000	8488000	It'll probably change it too much
8488000	8490000	The Wii remote would be not
8490000	8492000	the type of stuff
8492000	8494000	One other thing I know you're
8494000	8496000	really into Ray is that you
8496000	8498000	like a lot of the Japanese shmups
8498000	8500000	I know you talk a lot about those
8500000	8502000	when you call in. Are there any exciting things
8502000	8504000	to look forward to in 2010?
8504000	8506000	Um
8506000	8508000	Apparently
8508000	8510000	Escalita 2
8510000	8512000	which is also a cave shooter
8512000	8514000	is getting released soon by the
8514000	8516000	also published in the cave and
8516000	8518000	ported by M2, the same people behind
8518000	8520000	the Council for the Adventure of Rebirth
8520000	8522000	which does not allow for it to get downloaded
8522000	8524000	Out of curiosity
8524000	8526000	Do you play Ikaruga this week too?
8526000	8528000	Because it seems like everybody else did but me
8528000	8530000	I don't play Ikaruga
8530000	8532000	I haven't played it before
8532000	8534000	but I haven't touched it in years now
8534000	8536000	I see. Fair enough
8536000	8538000	I think you would be intensely pissed off by it
8538000	8540000	Is there anything else?
8540000	8542000	Go ahead
8542000	8544000	I try to play it
8544000	8546000	just to survive
8546000	8548000	but then I keep hearing the robotic
8548000	8550000	where it's going, watching, watching
8550000	8552000	and now it's pissed me off
8552000	8554000	remind me how bad I am at changing the game
8554000	8556000	Mmm
8556000	8558000	It's a very frustrating game
8558000	8560000	you really have to
8560000	8562000	I think it's one of those ones that you have to have
8562000	8564000	the experience of playing it so that
8564000	8566000	you start realizing what's coming where
8566000	8568000	and then it's more just one of those technical games
8570000	8572000	Yeah, it's like more memorization
8572000	8574000	based than like many other shooters
8574000	8576000	like more memorization
8576000	8578000	based than just like scoring
8578000	8580000	not like it's just a survival art type thing
8580000	8582000	but
8582000	8584000	Well, art type I still think is
8584000	8586000	a little bit less of a challenge than
8586000	8588000	Ikaruga
8588000	8590000	Okay, speaking of art type
8590000	8592000	the art type dimensions
8592000	8594000	on 360 can
8594000	8596000	I still refuse to play it
8596000	8598000	because if I try to play it on my
8598000	8600000	arcade stick
8600000	8602000	I wouldn't be able to change the controls
8602000	8604000	since A is below X
8604000	8606000	so I don't have to push my fingers in a rather awkward
8606000	8608000	position just to be able to play
8608000	8610000	because A is to fire an exit
8610000	8612000	to use the force pod
8612000	8614000	See, with that one I really like
8614000	8616000	playing it with the
8616000	8618000	regular controller
8618000	8620000	it's actually pretty cool to me
8620000	8622000	I don't know
8622000	8624000	I forgot my
8624000	8626000	Street Fighter IV stick
8626000	8628000	I haven't played a single 360 shmup
8628000	8630000	without it besides Omega 5
8630000	8632000	It's kind of interesting how that
8632000	8634000	Street Fighter IV stick is really adaptable
8634000	8636000	to lots of different games, isn't it?
8636000	8638000	Yeah
8638000	8640000	I'm
8640000	8642000	planning on eventually
8642000	8644000	modifying it to have a
8644000	8646000	different kind of stick
8646000	8648000	instead of starting with a 360 shmup
8648000	8650000	because I heard those are
8650000	8652000	better for shmups and other
8652000	8654000	games
8654000	8656000	I just wish they'd release a better d-pad
8656000	8658000	so we don't have to spend all this money on these
8658000	8660000	fancy schmancy joysticks
8660000	8662000	but hey, you know, whatever helps bring the experience in
8662000	8664000	Even with the d-pad
8664000	8666000	get in your way
8666000	8668000	Alright, well Ray, we gotta let you go to get some more
8668000	8670000	calls, but thank you as always for the call and a
8670000	8672000	variety of topics tonight and
8672000	8674000	I hope you get all the shmups you want in 2010, okay?
8674000	8676000	Hopefully
8676000	8678000	Alright, later! Bye
8678000	8680000	1877 Game OLR
8680000	8682000	Loki, I rudely cut you off earlier, I apologize
8682000	8684000	but of course our listeners come first, I'm sorry
8684000	8686000	It's alright. Serious Sam
8686000	8688000	HD is coming to Xbox Live
8688000	8690000	this week
8690000	8692000	That was the other thing I was gonna say
8692000	8694000	Alright, well we got another call
8694000	8696000	just in time. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8696000	8698000	Hi, this is
8698000	8700000	Spaznato. Hi Spaznato, what's on
8700000	8702000	your mind tonight, buddy?
8702000	8704000	A couple quick things
8704000	8706000	Sure
8706000	8708000	Since you just got
8708000	8710000	your 360 back
8710000	8712000	there was
8712000	8714000	one game that I
8714000	8716000	seriously recommend
8716000	8718000	that you at least give it a try
8718000	8720000	It came out
8720000	8722000	after your
8722000	8724000	virtual 360 broke
8724000	8726000	It said
8726000	8728000	Magic the Gathering
8728000	8730000	dual with the
8730000	8732000	paint walkers
8732000	8734000	Funny enough Spaznato
8734000	8736000	I had that game for one
8736000	8738000	week before my 360
8738000	8740000	went under. I did buy the full
8740000	8742000	version of that game, because you know, I used to
8742000	8744000	play Magic the Gathering back in the day
8744000	8746000	and when I say back in the day, I mean, I was
8746000	8748000	like 15, I was in high school
8748000	8750000	So if you do the math
8750000	8752000	that was like, literally half my age
8752000	8754000	So, god, Magic's been around
8754000	8756000	forever, hasn't it?
8756000	8758000	But it was really hard for me to remember
8758000	8760000	how to play, but yeah
8760000	8762000	I had a good time with it
8762000	8764000	Spaznato, were you a card game
8764000	8766000	player? Did you play Magic as a card game?
8766000	8768000	Or was this your first exposure to it?
8768000	8770000	Oh, I played
8770000	8772000	in high school
8772000	8774000	just like you
8774000	8776000	In fact, I was
8776000	8778000	a sophomore when I started playing it
8778000	8780000	and an
8780000	8782000	older classmate of mine
8782000	8784000	introduced me to the card
8784000	8786000	game and I got hooked right
8786000	8788000	away and I
8788000	8790000	played it all through high school
8790000	8792000	up until I graduated and then
8792000	8794000	once I hit college
8794000	8796000	and no one
8796000	8798000	around me played Magic the
8798000	8800000	Gathering, I kind of gave it up
8800000	8802000	But I tried to
8802000	8804000	play season one
8804000	8806000	Magic the Gathering
8806000	8808000	It was loosely based on
8808000	8810000	Magic, but it wasn't totally
8810000	8812000	faithful to the card game
8812000	8814000	But
8814000	8816000	the Xbox Live game
8816000	8818000	by comparison
8818000	8820000	is damn good
8820000	8822000	Yeah, I had an old, old version
8822000	8824000	on the PC that was released
8824000	8826000	probably around the same time I actually played the game
8826000	8828000	Maybe by the time I was a senior in high school or so forth
8828000	8830000	So it's been like 95, 96
8830000	8832000	that this was actually released
8832000	8834000	They had an old PC one that was
8834000	8836000	pretty darn good
8836000	8838000	It had its flaws
8838000	8840000	It wasn't quite as...
8840000	8842000	Gosh, in playing the 360 one
8842000	8844000	I never really realized
8844000	8846000	how many phases were in
8846000	8848000	around
8848000	8850000	It's just kind of one of those things that
8850000	8852000	when you're playing the card game
8852000	8854000	it just kind of flows
8854000	8856000	But when you're playing the 360 one, you really see
8856000	8858000	each phase go through
8858000	8860000	It's a pretty complex game
8860000	8862000	It's a pretty easy one to pick up
8862000	8864000	I happen to already have the game Spaznator
8864000	8866000	but for those that are curious to
8866000	8868000	pick it up
8868000	8870000	What's the thing you like most
8870000	8872000	about the Magic game?
8872000	8874000	Especially for someone who hasn't played the card game
8874000	8876000	What do you think makes the game
8876000	8878000	cool?
8878000	8880000	It's kind of
8880000	8882000	hard to
8882000	8884000	really pronounce words
8884000	8886000	but it's like
8886000	8888000	a combination of
8888000	8890000	getting the cards
8890000	8892000	that you need
8892000	8894000	when you need them
8894000	8896000	and then actually a little bit of know-how
8896000	8898000	and strategy
8898000	8900000	You know
8900000	8902000	You kind of like go
8902000	8904000	I can't think of anything
8904000	8906000	to nail these
8906000	8908000	I mean nail these off the top of my head
8908000	8910000	but
8910000	8912000	what I just said before
8912000	8914000	it's probably
8914000	8916000	fits the best that I can come up
8916000	8918000	with
8918000	8920000	By the way
8920000	8922000	Let me just
8922000	8924000	interject this real quick
8924000	8926000	X-Link posted this in our chat room
8926000	8928000	and this is exactly what I was looking for
8928000	8930000	It's Magic the Gathering
8930000	8932000	This is what always confused me
8932000	8934000	It was also called Duels of the Plainwalkers
8934000	8936000	It was released by Microprose in 1997
8936000	8938000	So a little later than I thought it was
8938000	8940000	I remember that you would get
8940000	8942000	a big oversized card that came
8942000	8944000	in the box that I thought was kind of funny
8944000	8946000	with the game
8946000	8948000	I totally used to use
8948000	8950000	the candelabra
8950000	8952000	to bring it into my regular deck
8952000	8954000	They had
8954000	8956000	an astral set
8956000	8958000	a set of cards that were specifically
8958000	8960000	in the game
8960000	8962000	Sorry
8962000	8964000	It was a whole little game that came out many years ago
8964000	8966000	It was still good
8966000	8968000	It was much different
8968000	8970000	Rob, that totally reminded me
8970000	8972000	of my other big thing of Geekery
8972000	8974000	I was using that same card to bring Captain Picard
8974000	8976000	into my deck
8976000	8978000	How do you do that?
8978000	8980000	It was like two combinations of cards
8980000	8982000	where you can bring any outside card
8982000	8984000	and put it in your graveyard
8984000	8986000	and then another one to recycle your graveyard
8986000	8988000	into your deck
8988000	8990000	That is crazy
8990000	8992000	So bring out Captain Picard
8992000	8994000	And what would the random card do?
8994000	8996000	Did it get stats of any sort?
8996000	8998000	Well I didn't have to cast anything
8998000	9000000	because I didn't have anything to cast
9000000	9002000	I always would say he'd rally my troops
9002000	9004000	Nice
9004000	9006000	Sorry for the bit of random and spazzinator
9006000	9008000	What else is on your mind besides magic?
9008000	9010000	Two more
9010000	9012000	quick hits
9012000	9014000	I know that you
9014000	9016000	specifically aren't really too
9016000	9018000	fortunate
9018000	9020000	I don't know about
9020000	9022000	Dark Sakura or Loki
9022000	9024000	or any of the other listeners
9024000	9026000	but I happen to notice
9026000	9028000	that over on
9028000	9030000	the PlayStation Network
9030000	9032000	store, specifically the
9032000	9034000	video site, they actually
9034000	9036000	got some sports programming
9036000	9038000	on there like
9038000	9040000	old NHL games
9040000	9042000	NBA games
9042000	9044000	NCAA football games
9044000	9046000	a little bit of everything
9046000	9048000	over there
9048000	9050000	I can't
9050000	9052000	speak
9052000	9054000	into well enough
9054000	9056000	they got the same thing over on
9056000	9058000	the Xbox Live
9058000	9060000	marketplace or not, it's been a while since
9060000	9062000	I checked out the video content over there
9062000	9064000	but if you happen to
9064000	9066000	like watching sports and there's nothing
9066000	9068000	good on regular TV
9068000	9070000	you know there's always that
9070000	9072000	I just happened to recently
9072000	9074000	buy an old
9074000	9076000	old hockey game
9076000	9078000	and
9078000	9080000	the Fiesta
9080000	9082000	Bowl from 2009
9082000	9084000	just validated
9084000	9086000	worked pretty good
9086000	9088000	you know and X-Link in chat
9088000	9090000	chimes into the sports
9090000	9092000	I have to be honest, I don't
9092000	9094000	serve the video marketplace very often because I have
9094000	9096000	Netflix and usually that kind of fills in
9096000	9098000	my video needs
9098000	9100000	but
9100000	9102000	it's interesting that
9102000	9104000	that exists
9104000	9106000	because if you saw a really awesome
9106000	9108000	play in a game or what have you
9108000	9110000	that's literally content on demand
9110000	9112000	but I don't know
9112000	9114000	it doesn't seem like that would be very
9114000	9116000	popular to watch a game and download it
9116000	9118000	long after it's been played
9118000	9120000	when you read about it on your favorite
9120000	9122000	sports or see it on ESPN the next day
9122000	9124000	but hey I guess if there's that one awesome play
9124000	9126000	or something really epic happens in the game
9126000	9128000	you can download it and watch it forever
9128000	9130000	even though it would be on YouTube too
9130000	9132000	yeah true
9132000	9134000	and you know
9134000	9136000	I'm not exactly the biggest
9136000	9138000	sports game out there
9138000	9140000	on Far From It
9140000	9142000	it's kind of weird because I'm from
9142000	9144000	a sports crazy city
9144000	9146000	but once in a great while
9146000	9148000	I do like to watch a game of
9148000	9150000	some sort and
9150000	9152000	I figure kind of like what the hell
9152000	9154000	I'll get that, there's nothing on the record
9154000	9156000	TV
9156000	9158000	it's kind of like
9158000	9160000	impulse buy
9160000	9162000	you know what if there's a buck to be made
9162000	9164000	off of the game and if they even make
9164000	9166000	$50 off the encoding and what have you
9166000	9168000	they'll probably do it
9168000	9170000	quickly what was your other thing, you said you had one other thing
9170000	9172000	and then we gotta let you go to get more calls
9172000	9174000	yeah
9174000	9176000	I had a relatively minor
9176000	9178000	bone to pick
9178000	9180000	with your number one
9180000	9182000	pick for listless
9182000	9184000	yeah, why is that?
9184000	9186000	well
9186000	9188000	Bobby said
9188000	9190000	what I was thinking
9190000	9192000	is that
9192000	9194000	X-Play
9194000	9196000	is nearly as big
9196000	9198000	a screen as not the greatest
9198000	9200000	show there ever is
9200000	9202000	or was, but
9202000	9204000	not quite as bad as
9204000	9206000	Alpha People
9206000	9208000	in fact
9208000	9210000	that's one of those
9210000	9212000	several searches I
9212000	9214000	gave me news from
9214000	9216000	I think that
9216000	9218000	is as well, but
9218000	9220000	it isn't
9220000	9222000	all bad
9222000	9224000	I might be
9224000	9226000	digging up old old stuff here
9226000	9228000	but let's not forget this is the show that thought Beatmania
9228000	9230000	was newer than Guitar Hero
9230000	9232000	I'm just, you know
9232000	9234000	sometimes the quality of the show
9234000	9236000	needs a little work, obviously
9236000	9238000	I'm picking on them because I can, but
9238000	9240000	you know
9240000	9242000	I don't know, I think the quality of gaming
9242000	9244000	television overall could be a little better
9244000	9246000	if somebody would just, would just try
9246000	9248000	alright
9248000	9250000	quickly
9250000	9252000	I ran out of cable
9252000	9254000	for like a year or so
9254000	9256000	but you know, there's one
9256000	9258000	thing I took into consideration
9258000	9260000	when I talk to people
9260000	9262000	alright, fair enough, alright Spaznator we gotta let you go
9262000	9264000	but take care, and have a good one, ok?
9264000	9266000	yep, you too
9266000	9268000	have a good one
9268000	9270000	and you know, I will give you guys that, it is the one remaining
9270000	9272000	tech TV show, but you know that in itself
9272000	9274000	is a bit of an atrocity, I mean there were so many
9274000	9276000	good tech TV shows
9276000	9278000	blah blah blah, this argument is
9278000	9280000	years old, it is what it is, it ain't coming back
9280000	9282000	this ain't the way they used to be, and that's just what we're gonna
9282000	9284000	have to deal with
9284000	9286000	1877 game OLR, username on Skype is
9286000	9288000	OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call
9288000	9290000	we'll try to get at least one more call in before we close up
9290000	9292000	shop tonight, do we have any other last minute
9292000	9294000	stories, Loki?
9294000	9296000	uh
9296000	9298000	maybe
9298000	9300000	yeah, there's new
9300000	9302000	Dragon Age Origins
9302000	9304000	download content coming out on January 5th
9304000	9306000	on PC and Xbox
9306000	9308000	360, it's gonna be coming out later in
9308000	9310000	January, on PlayStation 3
9310000	9312000	it's the return of Ostegar
9312000	9314000	let me get to the phones, hi you're on
9314000	9316000	OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9316000	9318000	this is dsmaster26
9318000	9320000	hey dsmaster, what's on your mind?
9320000	9322000	not much, I've been still
9322000	9324000	pretty pumped about
9324000	9326000	getting a 360
9326000	9328000	probably the best
9328000	9330000	game system I've ever owned
9330000	9332000	since the PS2
9332000	9334000	run that by me again
9334000	9336000	because you're a little quiet tonight, you're mad about
9336000	9338000	getting a 360 or what?
9338000	9340000	no, no, I'm happy
9340000	9342000	about getting a 360
9342000	9344000	did you get a 360 too?
9344000	9346000	it was the email I read, Rob
9346000	9348000	oh, sorry, I was telling you
9348000	9350000	no offense, but I was
9350000	9352000	having a really hard time reading your email because
9352000	9354000	you don't really use punctuation
9354000	9356000	oh, sorry
9356000	9358000	I was kind of writing it on the quick
9358000	9360000	have you seen that Facebook group that's
9360000	9362000	called, um, there's a big difference
9362000	9364000	between Let's Eat, Grandma
9364000	9366000	and Let's Eat, Grandma
9366000	9368000	I need to join that
9368000	9370000	because I'm actually a member of like four different
9370000	9372000	grammar forums
9372000	9374000	did you see the calendar I bought?
9374000	9376000	I get it, Eat, Shoots, and Leaves
9376000	9378000	I have not
9378000	9380000	seen that, but
9380000	9382000	if anything, I've been playing a whole
9382000	9384000	lot load of Halo 3
9384000	9386000	before Reach comes out
9386000	9388000	and I'm probably going to pick up Halo 1
9388000	9390000	and 2 and 3 ODFT
9390000	9392000	possibly when that comes out
9392000	9394000	and try to
9394000	9396000	gain up on the Halo story in a sense
9396000	9398000	are there still lots
9398000	9400000	of people playing Halo 3 online?
9400000	9402000	is it still as crazy popular as like Halo 2
9402000	9404000	is still being played online like five years after
9404000	9406000	it was out
9406000	9408000	yes, and there's still people playing
9408000	9410000	Halo 2 if you can believe it
9410000	9412000	I do believe it
9412000	9414000	because some, you know, 360s are
9414000	9416000	still expensive, there's a heck of people probably
9416000	9418000	still on the original Xbox, although then again
9418000	9420000	you're paying for Xbox Live
9420000	9422000	well, well, well, whatever
9422000	9424000	and actually apparently I read an article
9424000	9426000	on Kotaku
9426000	9428000	that said it's because of Halo 2
9428000	9430000	that we have the friend cap of
9430000	9432000	100 for the 360
9432000	9434000	that's right, I've
9434000	9436000	heard this come up, I think Bobby's
9436000	9438000	discussed this on his show before, I think I've heard him talk
9438000	9440000	about it where the whole
9440000	9442000	friend cap of 100, Halo 2 is
9442000	9444000	to blame because people are still playing
9444000	9446000	that, so in order for them to break the 100 cap
9446000	9448000	they would essentially have to disable Halo 2
9448000	9450000	which I don't think anyone wants to happen anytime soon
9450000	9452000	let me ask you this
9452000	9454000	DS Master, because you're a big Halo fan
9454000	9456000	what do you think of Halo Reach
9456000	9458000	is on its way this year?
9458000	9460000	Are you excited for that?
9460000	9462000	Well, I'm not really a Halo fan, but I'm like
9462000	9464000	I wanted a really good
9464000	9466000	first person shooter on a console
9466000	9468000	and after pulling
9468000	9470000	my troops holiday party
9470000	9472000	for Boy Scouts, which we do every year
9472000	9474000	like, it was so much fun
9474000	9476000	I was just like
9476000	9478000	holy crap, I'm finally getting the hang of this
9478000	9480000	playing a console FPS
9480000	9482000	after playing
9482000	9484000	Quake Live for nearly a year or two
9486000	9488000	I think I've told this story on the show before
9488000	9490000	but the very first time I ever played Halo was at a
9490000	9492000	wedding reception and that's where I actually had
9492000	9494000	a whole lot of fun, was shooting up
9494000	9496000	the wedding party, I shit you not, that's
9496000	9498000	the first time I ever played Halo
9498000	9500000	it was a good time
9500000	9502000	and actually our longest session was probably 2 hours
9502000	9504000	49 minutes and 19 seconds
9504000	9506000	Good lord
9506000	9508000	Then quickly, if you
9508000	9510000	are into first person shooters, what do you think
9510000	9512000	about the idea of turning them all into dating sims?
9514000	9516000	Please, I mean
9516000	9518000	it's enough of a dating sim with the girl gamers
9518000	9520000	trying to hit up on the gamer guys
9520000	9522000	on Xbox 5
9522000	9524000	Well, so who says it has to be a girls
9524000	9526000	and guys thing, I mean, you can have all different types
9526000	9528000	of dating sims and so forth
9528000	9530000	No kidding, I mean, that is
9530000	9532000	true, and
9532000	9534000	clearly from shivering and what not
9534000	9536000	it's cold in Nebraska, it sucks
9536000	9538000	You need to get shot with a
9538000	9540000	hug gun, I think is what needs to happen
9540000	9542000	You need to log into Halo and somebody needs to
9542000	9544000	shoot you with a hug gun
9544000	9546000	Alright, DS Master, I gotta let you go
9546000	9548000	so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your
9548000	9550000	call and your email and so forth, you take care, okay?
9550000	9552000	Peace out, keep the good shows rocking
9552000	9554000	Peace out, hero
9554000	9556000	We'll try, later
9556000	9558000	Alright,
9558000	9560000	that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
9560000	9562000	Sorry those didn't get through, but remember you can send us an email
9562000	9564000	It's okay, I mean, there was only one in the email
9564000	9566000	bag tonight, and then the person got through on the phone
9566000	9568000	anyway, but we can't control it
9568000	9570000	We don't have a call screener
9570000	9572000	We can't afford one
9572000	9574000	Maybe in the future, we'll see
9574000	9576000	Anyhow, we're gonna start to close up
9576000	9578000	shop here, because believe it or not, we've been on air for about
9578000	9580000	three hours, I know it might
9580000	9582000	not feel like that on the podcast because you do a little break
9582000	9584000	in the middle of life, but it's still gonna be a long
9584000	9586000	show tonight, and a good show, good
9586000	9588000	first show of the year
9588000	9590000	Set the tone for the rest of the year, hopefully
9590000	9592000	We'll be back to do it all again next week
9592000	9594000	I do want to ask real quick though, if there's any other last minute stories
9594000	9596000	before we wrap it up tonight, I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki
9596000	9598000	had anything else to throw out there, I know I don't
9598000	9600000	Loki's shaking his head no
9600000	9602000	I found the best book, it has nothing to do with games
9602000	9604000	Well, books are important too
9604000	9606000	I found the best book that's called
9606000	9608000	Why is Daddy in a Dress?
9608000	9610000	Answering Awkward Questions with Baby Animals
9612000	9614000	This is the best
9614000	9616000	Look, Rob
9616000	9618000	Why is Daddy in a Dress?
9618000	9620000	Okay
9620000	9622000	And here's one of the pages
9622000	9624000	How much for happy and wow
9624000	9626000	You used to hate that when you were doing massage classes
9626000	9628000	Well that's why I was laughing because
9628000	9630000	it just made me go wow
9630000	9632000	but it's cute with little kittens
9632000	9634000	There's one of like a little puppy
9634000	9636000	that said, um, are you
9636000	9638000	like, um
9638000	9640000	like, if, why does Daddy look like
9640000	9642000	the pool boy?
9642000	9644000	Um, I gotta read this comment
9644000	9646000	from Marissa and I hope she doesn't mind me
9646000	9648000	reading a private message publicly
9648000	9650000	I told her to send it to you
9650000	9652000	She said that they were just having a discussion
9652000	9654000	at her house about punctuation
9654000	9656000	Capitalization is important too
9656000	9658000	because like, for instance, you might have
9658000	9660000	you know, capitalization could change this sentence
9660000	9662000	um, help your uncle jack off the horse
9662000	9664000	you know, like, like, help him get off
9664000	9666000	the horse and so forth and you know
9666000	9668000	he's, he's, you know, old and needs assistance
9668000	9670000	getting off the horse, or if you didn't capitalize
9670000	9672000	that right, it might read as
9672000	9674000	help your uncle jack off the horse
9674000	9676000	as in
9676000	9678000	you need samples
9678000	9680000	for mating purposes
9680000	9682000	or whatever
9682000	9684000	Capitalization
9684000	9686000	and punctuation are important
9688000	9690000	I love those little kitten postcards
9690000	9692000	those are adorable
9692000	9694000	I don't want them. Alright, anyhow, uh
9694000	9696000	let's go around and get everybody's
9696000	9698000	stop giggling
9698000	9700000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought
9700000	9702000	and wrap up the show tonight
9702000	9704000	It's another great episode of Oral R and the Cannon
9704000	9706000	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9706000	9708000	Um, hopefully
9708000	9710000	I'll play Borderlands this week
9712000	9714000	Um, my final thought is
9714000	9716000	um, hopefully I'll get to play
9716000	9718000	one of the, like, 50 games
9718000	9720000	um, that I have
9720000	9722000	in my queue of games to play
9722000	9724000	uh, this week, get to spend more time
9724000	9726000	with that, but I'll probably be too busy trying to finish
9726000	9728000	Symphony of the Night and making progress in
9728000	9730000	Shadow Complex
9730000	9732000	and eventually playing Morrowind
9732000	9734000	Too many things to do
