14005	18291	Tonight, January 3rd, 2010, what could Google be planning for gaming?
18652	23139	A brand new 8-bit NES game is about to be released, and what in the world is a WiiWa?
31294	35719	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35800	42207	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42288	44791	Joining you over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts.
44811	48575	And with me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50470	52171	Always ready and alert as always, right?
53011	53692	Yeah, exactly.
54272	55893	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
56013	56433	Hello.
56553	57193	How you doing, Loki?
57253	57753	Doing fine.
57893	59514	I see you YouTubing something over there.
59574	60314	What's going on?
60335	66077	I'm just looking at an auction for a bar top cabinet thing because it's hilarious how much they try to charge for these things.
66537	68618	Like, they want $900 for this.
68998	70979	You can get two full-size arcade games for that.
71620	72300	These people are dumb.
72930	73490	Thanks for watching!
97515	98856	I remember, though, they beat me in a three.
98876	100357	They only wanted a few hundred dollars for it.
101057	101477	I don't remember.
101497	105679	It was a thousand or something, but I was seriously considering it.
105719	111102	If I wasn't a stinking adult with stinking adult responsibilities, I would have seriously considered it.
111162	120787	But, alas, another piece of my car broke this week, and it made me realize, you know, probably before I indulge in the video game habit, I probably ought to get a car.
121407	122068	Probably should.
122628	124089	Stupid responsibility.
124529	124809	Oh, well.
125485	128248	Rob, you are almost 75% to a new present.
129609	133452	Anyhow, yes, that's right, because you're working on an MP3.
134032	142279	Yeah, I've just discovered that the real player converter will convert to MP3 from stuff off YouTube.
142299	144201	There's a lot of websites that do that, too.
144281	145522	I've seen that happen.
145542	147483	This is so much easier because it just runs in the background.
147503	147804	That's cool.
147824	150206	And it works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox.
151086	154069	So enjoy your gift of Angela Aki covers.
154736	157238	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
157258	157759	It's freaking hard.
177609	178329	On the iPhone.
179789	185231	And then we had a bunch of Ride and Ford going on in the house last night.
186171	188511	And then they were all, no, let's watch Macross.
188811	189711	So they were watching Macross.
190132	190752	Macross Frontier.
192292	194172	I actually dropped by randomly yesterday.
194372	194592	Yes.
194933	197373	Because I wanted to show a friend the OLR studio.
197693	198673	And we had Sonic.
198773	200674	Yeah, you guys were watching Macross.
200754	204134	And I was kind of like, oh, anime that I'm not familiar with.
204154	206915	Because I don't follow anime as closely as I think a lot of our listeners do.
207737	209639	I don't follow it nearly as much as I used to.
210380	213423	But we have plenty of friends that do, and Dan's like, oh, bring it over, let's see what's new.
214364	215925	They had Hatalia, which I love.
216866	220690	That's the one where it's different personifications of countries.
221210	222752	So all the different countries are characters.
223092	225574	And America is trying to solve everything through cheeseburgers.
226635	229859	And Japan is very soft-spoken and never gives a clear answer.
230560	232441	Dan's still playing the hell out of Borderlands, out of curiosity?
233021	233821	Yeah, pretty much.
234181	238223	But he was really, he's actually played through Ikaruga the other night.
238663	243484	I was going to say, when I came over the other night, they were playing some Japanese shooter game on 360.
244105	247826	I wasn't sure if it was Trigger Hard Excelica or, I only glanced at it for a second.
247886	248466	It was Ikaruga?
248586	248826	Okay.
248926	254708	Yeah, because they were actually watching playthroughs of other people doing tricks, so they decided they were going to do them themselves.
255728	259650	And, because they, I think they watched some guy do a perfect playthrough of Ikaruga and decided that they wanted to do it.
260090	260190	So.
261263	261523	All right.
262364	263004	Loki, how about you?
263044	263724	How was your gaming week?
263744	264105	What did you do?
264345	268447	I, too, played Ikaruga on my arcade cabinet because I was working on getting Naomi stuff.
268467	269007	Random.
269427	269748	Okay.
271008	282234	You know, so I was working on getting my Naomi and Atomic Wave and actually also my Zinc emulation running.
283315	284956	Zinc, though, doesn't seem to run very well.
286932	291597	The loader that I have for it sucks, so I have to do it by hand.
292158	294921	But I tried playing Urgot, and that's pretty fun.
295021	300507	Except I wish the Japanese ROM would work, because I think the US one doesn't have Cloud in it.
300748	301148	Yes, it does.
301609	301929	It does?
302189	304312	It has Cloud Antifa, because I've played one.
304532	306174	Do I have to unlock it or something?
306779	317387	I do not remember, because it's been a long time since I've played it, but I thought it was either that or time released, or that it's some little trick you have to do, but yeah, I've played both of them in the American cabinet.
317987	326313	Well, then I will have to mess around with that, but in the meantime, I couldn't get any of the controls to work, even though I configured them correctly, it's just being retarded.
327574	329415	I did play a little bit of Atomic Wave, had...
331364	332805	Dolphin Blue Marvel vs. Capcom 2
352045	359792	A processor in the arcade cabinet because it's only 2.2 GHz whereas you probably need a little bit more than that.
359933	363356	So I actually have to overclock it since I can do that.
364797	369161	So maybe that'll fix it because right now the sound's a little laggy and it's kind of annoying.
369181	375087	Then, let's see what else did I play other than Ikaruga.
378286	384844	Oh, Guilty Gear Iizuka, which is interesting, because I didn't realize that they had a four-player Guilty Gear game, so that was neat.
387912	395516	And then other than arcade cabinet stuff, I played through the rest of the LittleBigPlanet Pirates of the Caribbean level pack.
395596	396317	And it was alright.
396417	400719	It wasn't as cool as the Melgar Solid pack, but it was pretty good.
401060	403721	Still worth the five or six bucks you have to pay for it.
404221	407223	But still, how can you top guns?
408504	411045	It's tough, so it's understandable.
412106	412186	Um...
413780	420724	And then of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto, still no Borderlands, thought about it, but been working on the cabinet, so I haven't had a chance to play anything.
420804	421544	You can borrow Dan's.
422825	424926	I have Borderlands, I just haven't played it.
425947	426687	Damn, okay.
426727	432731	I've been sitting on it for weeks now, months now actually, so I'll eventually get around to it.
432771	436973	I'd like to play it too, so if you don't ever crack open that copy, I find it at home.
436993	440235	Oh, it's cracked open, it's ready to go, it's just, I just haven't gotten a chance to do it yet.
440295	441836	When are you bringing Bayonetta over for me?
443203	445485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
472028	473189	I think they're about 8 hours ahead of us.
485146	486827	I'm gonna get the call in the green!
488188	489269	That little wanker!
490150	494253	No wanker talk there, but he's like, So, I'm gonna get the green, fella!
494593	506141	I like getting cussed at in, um, like, other, like, I don't wanna say other languages, but other dialects, I guess you could say, where, you know, other, uh, you know, getting called a poof, and, you know, all those other types of words.
506681	507682	It was pretty brutal, though.
507722	510965	I had 47 kills in 20 minutes with a streak of 14, and, uh...
514466	542462	and people were pissed so it was fun in fact actually the second place had less than half as many kills as I did so it was fun so that's what I've been playing all that fun stuff awesome I'm just imagining all the little talk on Grand Theft Auto we don't talk back because it's hard to wear headphones and a headset at the same time so we just listen to it and it's funny
542622	543542	Has anyone invented that?
543582	544322	Like a third party?
544703	546043	A headphone slash headset?
546103	560487	They have my actual 5.1 headset, which by the way, and I don't know why these headsets do this, but one of the channels is already cutting out on it because I guess the cord is so heavy that it's pulling it out a little bit.
560667	563868	So I'm only getting one speaker, which is annoying.
564648	566208	I've had other headsets do the same thing.
566328	568749	But yeah, they have like Turtle Beach headsets, but they're like $100.
568789	571590	I think the cheapest one you can get that has that built in is like
572751	573471	I don't know, maybe $60.
574711	583213	But really what they need to come up with is a clip-on microphone or something like that that you can just wear so you can talk.
583473	585634	Because you don't really need the headset to hear people talking.
585834	590195	Most games have a way you can listen to it through your actual headphones.
590795	593135	So that's all you really need.
593155	594516	It's just really awkward the way it is.
598330	602814	Going to the chat room, of course, our always present fourth guest on the show, chat.orangesongeradio.com.
602834	612941	If you're listening live on this Sunday night, as we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
613461	616964	You should be joining us in our chat room, and check that out, chat.orangesongeradio.com.
617604	621027	SSJ100Matt says, I thought Rob's British accent is banned from the show.
621387	624850	I don't remember that getting an official banning, but fine, it'll be my Welsh accent there.
625070	625230	Yeah.
626614	629457	Anyhow, going into... It's not sing-songy enough.
632320	633021	I'll work on it.
633401	638086	If my Japanese pronunciation got better, maybe I should resolve this year to work on my British accent.
638627	638987	I don't know.
639728	643432	I'll have to Skype some of our British listeners and say, please teach me how to say cute things.
644192	644593	I'll teach you...
646383	648324	Teach me how to speak English English.
648844	651245	Yes, please teach me how to speak English.
652046	653266	I can't even do that on the show.
653567	662531	If you've listened to the past two or three months of show, I don't know if it's because I have to multitask a lot while doing this show or what, but sometimes the things that come out of my mouth, I'm like, what did I say?
662651	664432	I just totally butchered the English language.
664932	666833	I need English lessons from an English person.
666873	667414	That's what I need.
668334	668594	Anyhow.
669254	670695	You know, they do have those.
672456	673617	I want to say that it's...
676518	680561	British English as a language learning system
701591	701851	DarkSakura
722998	724799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
751363	751784	Thanks for watching!
758444	759185	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
788266	810738	and I finally took the opportunity to download Shadow Complex to my 360 and check it out and wow did I miss that like seriously that game was kind of awesome and by kind of I mean really it is like a Super Metroid Castlevania type exploration game but a little more modernized and part I gotta be honest
811138	812319	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
832210	835311	I finally got over it and downloaded the game and I had an awesome time with it.
835791	840053	I am really wanting to play that game through to completion and I highly recommend it.
840113	840873	It was fun.
841734	852037	I was impressed by how much they crammed into an arcade download because seriously, they could charge $30 for this stuff on Blu-ray or I'm sorry, it's $3.60.
852458	858120	They could charge this on a DVD and put it in stores and most folks would be none the wiser.
858900	863004	So, yeah, I was very excited to play Shadow Complex.
863244	874475	I'll spend a little bit of time with Gyromancer, which I played on the PC a little bit ago, but one of my friends sat me down and kind of explained the game a little better, because I've got to admit, the tutorial, because the game kind of
874875	876116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
905497	911433	I don't know, I feel more accomplished playing Gyromancer I feel like I got nowhere in Puzzle Quest because I didn't spend 100 hours with it
913247	917871	I'm looking forward to spending more time with Gyromancer Did you even bother to look at it on the 360?
917911	917951	No
935966	937107	I didn't care.
937247	938327	I have it on my computer.
938587	939307	I gotta be honest.
939507	940368	It's really nothing.
940868	946690	It's a frivolous, silly thing on the 360 and probably is something most people look at only once.
947630	952492	I gotta say, I did play with Facebook a little bit too, and I think Facebook looks hideous on the 360.
952852	960515	I hate the way it's laid out because they try to put Facebook in the Xbox crossbar format, which the more and more I use it, the more and more I really don't like the NXE.
961255	964117	I love all the features, I hate the layout.
964777	967459	What they had before, I honestly think was better, but whatever.
969080	977284	The cool thing about Facebook is that you can find friends on Facebook that are on 360, and you can find friends on 360 that are on Facebook.
977304	985129	The gamer tags and names are linked, so maybe I have people on my Xbox list that I didn't have added on Facebook, or, for example, somehow...
985569	991313	I didn't have Tiara on my Xbox 360 list, but I found, because she's on my Facebook, that she had a gamer tag, so I sent her a friend request.
991573	994135	So Tiara, if you're listening, accept my friend request.
994655	995396	You're making me cry.
998097	999839	And of course I had to play a little bit of Last.fm too.
999859	1001380	I had to catch up on all this crap I missed.
1001400	1003841	I realize this is like months old, but it was all new to me.
1004141	1013328	But anyway, the Twitter response I got to my tweet about, hi, for my 360, I have one again, was, oh, well, guess your PlayStation 3 is going to be collecting dust now, huh?
1013988	1015089	No, I think,
1016306	1023231	Honestly, this little bit of downtime has really raised my respect for Sony because I know we've given them a lot of crap on the show, and rightfully so.
1023331	1024052	Don't get me wrong.
1024112	1027275	I haven't suddenly said Sony is forgiven for everything they've done wrong.
1027675	1033880	I think they made lots and lots of great improvements in 2009, and there's things I look forward to from them in 2010.
1034340	1037262	And in fact, there's going to be some cases where it's 360 versus PlayStation 3.
1037562	1038523	I'm going the route of PlayStation 3.
1039084	1040465	For example, Final Fantasy XIII.
1040765	1041886	I plan to buy that on PlayStation 3.
1042566	1043487	Better controller, better graphics.
1043667	1072440	I think the game was designed for that in the first place that's just where I'm going Microsoft fans, put down the hate mail because there's some things I'm going to opt for on 360 as well for instance a lot of the things that have online play I just know more people on 360 that's probably where I'll go with those games plus I'm still playing a lot of DJ Hero and that's on Playstation 3 for me so I have to throw that out there too I finally got the trophy for playing every song in the game at least once even the songs I didn't want to play I finally played everything at least once so making good progress there
1073370	1073515	Um...
1074907	1081569	I'm going to our chat room again, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Some people wondering what NXE was, because I just rattled that off.
1081589	1083050	Yeah, that's the new Xbox experience.
1083290	1085151	That's the new interface they launched.
1085251	1085911	When was that?
1086051	1087031	Was that last holiday?
1087371	1088632	That was about September of 08?
1088872	1089612	I think so.
1089752	1093694	When they switched from what was called the Blades to this new system that I can't stand.
1094174	1096895	I cannot stand the new 360 layout.
1097275	1097895	I love it.
1098175	1099556	Sony fans, I'll give you that.
1099736	1103497	I think PlayStation 3 makes a hell of a lot more sense than 360 does to navigate around in.
1104097	1106419	I actually think it's really simple how they have it set up.
1106960	1108941	There's so much useless garbage in there.
1109362	1112524	Do you know how long it took me to figure out how to change my theme?
1113145	1114446	Something that shouldn't be that hard.
1115026	1118569	Oh, I have to go into myself and then it's there.
1118609	1119850	Oh, it's not in the guide button.
1120411	1122753	It's not in these other settings.
1123513	1124614	Oh, I have to do this and this.
1124955	1126816	I thought that made perfect sense for it to be there.
1127597	1129959	I mean, if it's my theme, it would be my preference.
1129979	1130059	Yeah.
1130259	1132820	But there's nowhere on that box to say my preferences.
1132881	1142566	In fact, if you hit the guide button and go into preferences, you get a bunch of console preferences that have nothing to do with theme, but like parental guides and user ratings and things I thought I disabled.
1142586	1143607	That's not where I thought to go.
1143707	1146848	I like it better.
1146908	1147789	I like how it's laid out better.
1147809	1149530	I think that it makes a lot more sense the way it's laid out.
1152281	1157883	The only thing that I don't like is just the ads, I guess, for the stuff that I don't care about.
1158304	1161645	But really, the stuff that I want to get to quickly, I can get to very quickly.
1162086	1163587	And to be fair, Sony has the ads too.
1163647	1166388	So if I'm going to hate it on 360, I have to hate it on Sony.
1166408	1167649	But I just... I don't know.
1167669	1170810	The crossbar just works better for me than NXT's been working.
1171211	1171411	But...
1172628	1176890	To Microsoft's credit, they tend to upgrade their crap pretty fast.
1177131	1183674	And maybe some of these things that I'm QQing about, they will fix on the next update, even though I think they're only doing them yearly now, I'm not sure.
1184274	1187116	Anyhow, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
1187416	1196021	I know I talked about a lot of games, and really, I didn't even talk about everything I played, because I went on a shopping spree on Steam, because they've been having their massive holiday sale.
1196041	1197762	I don't know if any of you guys alluded to this.
1198162	1200724	Dude, I got Morrowind for five bucks yesterday.
1201684	1205366	Just because it was five bucks and I liked Oblivion, yet I'd never played Morrowind.
1205386	1207166	So I was like, yeah, I'm going to drop five bucks on it.
1207627	1211068	And I got Luminous last week, and I think there was another game I bought too.
1211848	1217791	That's the problem with this stinking Steam sale is that, yeah, the games are only five bucks, but suddenly I bought four of them.
1218571	1219271	I dropped 20.
1220372	1221392	You've just been friended, Rob.
1221592	1222093	Yay!
1222373	1223593	Did you get a message from Tiara?
1223793	1224313	She's listening.
1224594	1225234	Thank you, Tiara.
1226949	1228549	Now I'm going to kick your ass in Puzzle Fighter.
1228669	1229090	I'm just kidding.
1230610	1231590	We'll rock band or something.
1232510	1234431	Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.
1234451	1235611	So let's go to housekeeping.
1235951	1239492	Podcast listeners, I know you thought we've neglected you and I'm sorry.
1239592	1240732	And that's my bad.
1240752	1242593	That has nothing to do with Jamie or Matt.
1242613	1245114	That's my responsibility and I've really slacked on it over the holidays.
1245514	1246034	But I...
1246914	1247735	Crack the whip today.
1247755	1251597	I got all four shows from December up, and we are caught up.
1251978	1260704	Although I don't like to make New Year's resolutions, one of my goals, let's say, for 2010 is to do Monday turnarounds on the shows so that those are up on the feeds on Monday.
1260764	1264746	So keep me on my toes, Twitters and Facebookers.
1264806	1267969	If I don't have the show up, tell me to quit playing WoW and get the damn show up.
1268769	1273733	It is, by the way, it is not as simple as just clicking a button that says upload because we do edit the show.
1273753	1275635	When I say edit, we don't edit content.
1275695	1281220	We don't really edit anything out unless there's like a huge technical failure that causes the show to go down for 10 minutes or something.
1281540	1290768	But we have to clean up the actual MP3s themselves, take out the little, you know, you're listening to all games radio and all that and the little stuff that gets in the master file and all that.
1291348	1292649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1308764	1309405	Thank you for watching!
1325606	1326848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1343106	1372642	and our old pal Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us is going to join us because he always has us on his show but we never seem to get him on ours because we're on after him so there's no real tease at the end of the show because we go off air at that point but we're going to get him on the show tonight to at least say thank you and let him participate in our silly little game but before we get to the games we get to the news Loki yes there's a rumor kind of involving the development of the PlayStation 4 which you know
1373871	1375192	You know it's coming, eventually.
1375652	1382877	And obviously they're probably, you know, they started work on it the day after the PlayStation 3 came out.
1384197	1399107	So one of the possible pieces of technology that will be in the PlayStation 4 and possibly considered for additional units afterwards would be this thing called Project Larrabee.
1399927	1402028	And what it is, is it's actually a...
1404423	1430694	A piece of hardware developed by Intel And it's kind of an architecture that revolves around a lot of CPUs, that's for sure Because, you know, the kind of diagram that they have They have a bunch of different CPU cores, including this picture I think it's about 16 cores And each with their own, you know, cache And kind of revolving around this thing they call a ring bus Um
1432501	1434963	PC Watch's Hiroshinji Goto
1462975	1467438	Naming some unnamed sources familiar with Intel's long-awaited larvae project.
1468378	1475723	And also, apparently, Intel was pursuing relationships with Microsoft and Nintendo as well for their next-gen consoles.
1476283	1481146	So, maybe this technology might not be only in the Sony console.
1481506	1483788	And who knows if it's even going to be in the Sony console.
1485529	1486009	But, um...
1487517	1488259	I don't know, it's kind of neat.
1489141	1495555	In something like this, you know, they could definitely scale it to however many processors they want in there.
1496630	1500273	Actdeft in chat says, Breaking news, PS4 is coming, eventually.
1501194	1507979	Which I think is what a lot of us that just kind of looked at this story went, yeah, okay, so PS4, they're already planning some of the stuff for it, sure, it's going to happen sometime.
1508299	1510481	What would this really mean for the system?
1510561	1512683	I mean, is this just a boost in power?
1512783	1518428	Is this, you know, is this vaporware like the emotion engine chip?
1518608	1519388	I mean, what is this?
1519589	1525854	Well, multi-processors like that, I mean, obviously it's going to be the crunch, everything from graphics to physics,
1527229	1528310	GameLogic, whatever.
1529210	1544019	With this, obviously, you're going to be able to push better graphics, better physics in the games, more detailed gameplay, better sound, a whole lot more detail in there.
1544380	1553365	Problem is, though, when you are able to push that much details, you have to also create that much detail, and then development costs rise, and so on and so forth.
1553465	1554606	So there is kind of a
1558038	1559359	I... Downside to everything.
1559419	1564081	That's how Nintendo's kind of getting around it because their system isn't really pushing that, you know, great graphics.
1564462	1571485	Although there are companies that will try to kind of squeeze every ounce of, you know, power out of the Wii.
1572846	1582872	You know, you don't have to because their console doesn't look that... I mean, there's only so much they can do graphic-wise in there, so... Kind of to let the gameplay shine through.
1582932	1586194	But with Sony, though, you know, it's really all about...
1589607	1593818	Just trying to push better graphics, better specs, better everything.
1595362	1596565	I mean, that's really what they've been...
1597381	1598042	Do them from the get-go.
1598062	1599223	That's what they've been really pushing with.
1599423	1600664	Remember with the PlayStation 3?
1600704	1603526	They're like, oh yeah, all the games are going to come out at 1080p.
1603546	1605528	Everything's going to run at 120 frames per second.
1606569	1607870	It's going to be super awesome.
1607890	1610031	You're just going to blow your load when you see anything on the screen.
1610212	1610772	That type of stuff.
1611493	1613935	And obviously that didn't really happen.
1614195	1615576	I mean, a lot of this stuff comes out now at 720p.
1615596	1617738	Nothing is running at 120 frames per second.
1617758	1618098	I mean, TVs...
1621941	1624525	Most TVs out there, you wouldn't be able to see that.
1625506	1631876	Let me ask a weird, maybe tangent kind of question that I don't even know if it has an easy answer, so I'm really posing this to chat as well.
1633591	1634753	I know we say this a lot.
1634973	1638717	I've said this as a kid and I've said this growing up and I'm sure a lot of you did this too.
1638737	1642301	Like even back in the Nintendo days, 8-bit NES days.
1643302	1645625	Dude, games look so realistic now.
1645805	1647527	I don't know how they're going to look any better.
1647587	1649830	I mean, it looks like a cartoon on my screen.
1649890	1651212	It's awesome, right?
1651272	1653794	We always kind of say that and then somehow they get better.
1654335	1665298	But I really feel like we're at this point now where like PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, like the stuff that that renders really is close to like DVD, Blu-ray quality.
1665739	1668159	I mean, what is left to improve?
1668459	1673061	My eye cannot tell the difference that easily between 720p and 1080p.
1673341	1675241	How are they going to justify an upgrade to PlayStation 4?
1675822	1681063	And the other thing too is, I mean, who knows what the technology is going to be like when the PlayStation 4 comes out.
1681083	1683244	I mean, how long did it take for them to develop, you know...
1683704	1687065	High Definition, 720p, 1080p, and so on.
1687105	1688045	It's only a few years.
1688505	1691506	I mean, we have no idea what technology is going to be like then.
1691646	1701429	And I mean, this kind of processor, I wouldn't be surprised if we see this in a future PC processor or anything, this lower B thing where you can add something beyond four cores.
1701449	1703450	You can just add as many cores as you want.
1704410	1711252	I mean, granted, the chip might be bigger or you have multiple processors in there and stuff, but I don't know.
1711392	1712172	It's interesting.
1713536	1715501	I guess I have to admit, you have a pretty good argument there.
1715561	1720071	The thing that it will do we haven't thought of yet, or it would already be in the system.
1720151	1723198	Or they're just making it to do things that we haven't thought of yet.
1724102	1735031	What about, and this might be crazy talk, but especially with, you know, Avatar, the movie having done so well at the box office and being so well received, especially as the visuals.
1735091	1742677	I mean, I haven't seen it yet myself, and I know I ragged on it, but clearly I must have been wrong because everybody I know has been raving about the movie.
1743117	1749122	Even if they don't like the story, everybody's pretty consistent with, but the visuals, wow, wow, wowie, wow.
1749583	1750924	You know, is this whole 3D...
1752645	1753025	2 1⁄2 hours.
1753325	1753505	Oh, okay.
1782182	1782963	I'll see you next time.
1796841	1797682	Yeah, hilarious.
1798963	1803867	AmazeSatsuma in chat says, the PlayStation 4 will give you new eyes to see its new, better, older graphics.
1804248	1808772	Dude, you might be joking, but if we're talking 3D, you gotta have those glasses, right?
1808932	1810313	That's new eyes of a sort.
1810333	1810653	Not really.
1810793	1812295	Well, yeah, I mean, you do need the glasses.
1812355	1817799	I think that, you know, I could see something, you know, for, like, realty, where it's just polarized glasses.
1817839	1818540	Those things are cheap.
1819020	1820462	You know, I'd rather have that than $200 shutter glasses, so...
1824520	1852877	and I guess the old rule of thumb is gaming has to get closer and closer to the holodeck from Star Trek is that every system brings us one step closer to the holodeck and 3D glasses will be a pretty big step in that direction until eventually I do my PlayStation 6 is just a room in my house that I walk into and you know computer activate Final Fantasy program and I am in the holodeck basically that's where gaming is headed right?
1855053	1857274	You remember we did have the U-Force?
1860637	1861277	The U-Suck?
1863639	1864520	The U-Force.
1865040	1870484	My friend had one of those and it did not work like you would think in the advertisements, that's for dang sure.
1870524	1878090	I've got one of the ones that came with, oh shoot, what was that game that was on Genesis and then on Sega CD?
1878210	1879391	The Activator.
1881223	1882924	But now I can't remember the game and it was a really cool game.
1883364	1887247	I will never forget when Loki took the activator and made it a Para Para Paradise controller.
1887467	1888447	No, I thought about it.
1888647	1890428	Basically, I just took it apart.
1890769	1891749	No, actually, I didn't even take it apart.
1891789	1892410	I just threw it away.
1893690	1894871	Or, I don't know what I did with that.
1896653	1897414	I was going to, though.
1920916	1922497	How long until someone puts their dick in it?
1922877	1925178	Because that's... Not necessarily how long.
1925298	1929159	It's basically, as I've seen before, it's TTP.
1929480	1930380	Time to penis.
1930960	1934242	And whether it be like... Is there a website dedicated to this?
1934282	1935022	No, there isn't.
1935382	1941564	But it's basically, you know, in how long will someone create a penis with it or put their penis in it?
1942365	1943765	Or use it... And install Linux on it.
1943785	1944606	That's the other question.
1944626	1947047	Or use it in conjunction with their penis.
1947107	1949308	That's basically... You know, like for example...
1950608	1954050	The Wii Vitality Sensor.
1954110	1960774	How long until someone puts a penis into that?
1961434	1962154	LittleBigPlanet.
1962174	1964356	How long until someone creates a penis in that?
1964956	1968978	That was like milliseconds.
1969318	1972420	There's a whole bunch of stuff like that.
1972440	1973200	That is a good point.
1973441	1977062	If we get to the holodeck, there's going to be guys that never leave the house.
1977303	1977563	I mean...
1979028	1982470	I hope the holodeck has a holobathroom because people will live there.
1982530	1983870	It's going to be strange.
1984471	1984731	Anyhow.
1986632	1989053	Alright, hey, changing tones completely.
1989113	1998257	Something else that game devices do these days is play movies and obviously digital distribution is getting big but some studios might have some second thoughts after what happened this week.
1998757	2003299	Sony apparently put the movie Armored, which is a new release that's playing in theaters right now.
2003800	2006101	I had not heard of this movie but it looks like the
2006781	2010446	Bow, Pow action type of flick that I would not usually see.
2011287	2018216	It's Armored is the movie and it's Matt Dillon and Lawrence Fishburne and Jean Reno and all these people.
2018777	2020599	Oh, Peter Petrelli's in it though.
2020619	2021460	I see him in the poster.
2023222	2025024	All these people are in this movie, Armored.
2025405	2029328	And apparently, the movie... I don't know how it's doing at the box office.
2029389	2030970	I don't think it's in the top ten.
2031370	2032091	Because, like, what?
2032131	2037597	You've got Avatar and the Sherlock Holmes and the Alvin and the freaking Chipmunks.
2038197	2039137	How did that happen?
2039818	2040318	And all this.
2040738	2045719	Well, Armored, despite the fact that it's not doing well in theaters, maybe this is not helping the case.
2045819	2048960	It was available for download on the PlayStation Store this week.
2049240	2053762	That's right, you could actually download a movie already in theaters on the PlayStation Store.
2054202	2056602	Not just that, it was up for free.
2057243	2058343	I call that the internet.
2060219	2063840	Well, yeah, but usually this type of thing is not, like, officially done by Sony.
2064140	2066841	And, to be honest, this really wasn't either.
2067001	2076805	It was, of course, lol whoopsie, you know, somebody accidentally put that thing up long before it should have gone up and put it up for the price of free.
2077065	2083207	But what I think is interesting about this, I mean, yeah, haha, point and laugh, do your Nelson, aha, you know, at Sony for whatever happened over this.
2083247	2085128	But I find it interesting that...
2085290	2086631	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2108663	2112185	Nobody's waiting to deliver the movie to the service.
2112205	2115966	And I realize, I think this is one of Sony's studios that put the movie out.
2116406	2117947	So maybe that's part of the reason.
2118027	2123929	But, I mean, isn't that kind of weird that it was sitting there on the store waiting to go?
2124529	2128671	Probably all these movies are already sitting on the store if people knew how to hack in there.
2128891	2137975	Keep in mind that, and this even goes back to the VHS days, is that there were often screener copies available for awards ceremonies and whatnot.
2138335	2142837	I actually had a copy of American Pie, not American Pie, American Beauty.
2144058	2146959	When, no, I take that back, I take that back.
2147019	2148339	It was Titanic is what I had.
2148960	2153502	I had a screening version of Titanic when it had just gotten out of the theater.
2154642	2156603	That's the only way I was going to see it was for free.
2156923	2161125	Yeah, a really, really good friend of mine who may or may not be sitting in this room used to get those screener copies all the time.
2161225	2163166	No, not those kind of screener copies.
2164527	2166427	Not the review screeners.
2166668	2171110	The actual... For your consideration, Oscar screeners.
2171230	2171470	Yes.
2172030	2176552	They have screen copies of movies literally right... Sometimes even before they come out.
2177253	2182255	We watched Snakes on a Plane at my work right before we went to theaters and...
2183703	2184123	Yay!
2184223	2186686	But, you know, it... I saw that at Disneyland.
2187526	2188067	It's done.
2188207	2189008	You know, it can be done.
2189308	2193471	It's just... Yeah, but I don't think PlayStation 3 is being used as a screening service.
2193531	2195793	Although, kind of interesting if it could be.
2197075	2201498	I'm kind of surprised that they don't have... You know, because with piracy and everything going on, I'm kind of surprised they don't have a device.
2201518	2208825	It'll be funny, though, if that copy gets ripped and just, you know, dumped and then that is... I'm sure it already happened.
2209085	2211407	It happened long before you thought of it.
2213497	2214237	Here's the thing, though.
2214497	2216698	I don't care about that movie at all.
2217459	2220820	If I saw it for free, I'd be like, nope, still don't want to watch it.
2221640	2222060	Sorry.
2222901	2224841	I have better things to do for an hour and a half.
2226782	2233985	Yeah, but still, I'm going to say call weird on the whole it was up on the marketplace long before it should have been, right?
2234625	2234825	Yeah.
2236146	2237546	That does kind of go without saying.
2237846	2240627	Well, I'm sure somebody's going to get a write-up over that one.
2240828	2241808	We'll see what happens now.
2242443	2244106	Someone's probably pissing their pants.
2244326	2245168	Probably already fired.
2246030	2246691	Well, how about...
2248556	2261000	Now, I don't really think this is strange news at all, but Final Fantasy XIII sales have actually decreased from how they were during the release.
2261860	2273464	I don't see why that's a really big thing, because just about when anything comes out, especially something big like that, everyone's going to be picking up their copy during the first week.
2273504	2274484	It had a million plus sales.
2274944	2286112	release day, broke records for the first week, and then it basically dropped about a million units into the second week.
2287633	2290034	It did take a dip because everyone's already bought it.
2291615	2299681	Also, Squeenix is pretty much like, well, when it gets the worldwide release, we're going to hit our numbers, so they're not too worried about it.
2300199	2327376	I think another thing, especially with Final Fantasy XIII is that they, dude, they released it the week before Christmas, so of course the second week is gonna, I mean, I don't know how big of a holiday Christmas is in Japan compared to here, I'm imagining it's not quite the same big deal and same shopping patterns that we have here but, you know, still, that's gotta have some impact is that you don't really have the amount of holiday purchasing going on in the second week when you release your game the week before a big holiday, right?
2328037	2329018	I'm sure that's a part of it too.
2329298	2329478	Yeah.
2329778	2331139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2355811	2357372	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2381747	2382167	and in Europe.
2383148	2384209	Huge first week sales.
2384729	2385970	Huge drop-off second week.
2386451	2387311	90% drop-off second week.
2388352	2393216	And unfortunately, they're just not releasing at a time like Christmas where it's going to sell consistently.
2393436	2394557	March is kind of a weird month.
2394877	2395878	They should have already had it ready.
2397699	2398020	We'll see.
2400301	2408688	Alright, so other things might cause the drop-off of Final Fantasy XIII would be WeWa.
2410154	2424609	Okay, well maybe not, but WiiWa is this thing, I think I talked about it on the show before, because this is where I got my Cage Match song, D-A-N-C-E, from, at least the idea for it.
2425269	2432316	Basically, WiiWa is a brand new game that's coming out, and it's using a unique...
2433237	2433377	So, um...
2463240	2465450	it looks neat, I guess I don't know
2466598	2467418	What kind of game is it?
2467478	2468559	Is it a pet sim game?
2468599	2469459	Is it like an action game?
2469479	2470339	No, it's like an action game.
2470379	2473460	It's like something you'd see from Rare or something even.
2474040	2479942	Just kind of a little platformer game where you walk around and you sneak up on enemies and stuff like that.
2479982	2490865	They have little mini games in there including one that I guess the WiiWare has these bungee cord things on it where you can fling it into the air and you kind of do that almost like a spring.
2490885	2495206	I'm pulling up a little video here in studio courtesy of our chat room.
2499289	2515978	These little, looks like a, kind of a Crash the Bandicoot Oh, you put the Wiimote in its mouth, so you force feed it Okay Oh, so you have to like, shake the thing around, that's kind of cute Back and forth and stuff
2517492	2518233	That's adorable.
2518493	2519474	It is kind of cute.
2519594	2524339	Like, I noticed that, you know, it's not aimed at adults.
2524379	2529225	They have a little, like, six-year-old kid in the video doing this.
2529965	2532108	That's cute.
2532488	2533729	I would totally play this.
2535191	2535351	Oh!
2539847	2541928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2567512	2570895	Although I will point out, that little stuffed animal has a hole in its mouth.
2571676	2572336	Time to penis?
2572737	2573117	15 seconds.
2576580	2577101	Just saying.
2577861	2578602	It's a new peripheral.
2579042	2580023	It has to be measured.
2580444	2581084	No pun intended.
2581224	2581785	That's true.
2585921	2590603	Speaking of adorable and cute games, although this one I don't think Jamie plays quite as much.
2590663	2591404	Maybe she should, though.
2591784	2600109	And if she wants to know where to begin, LittleBigPlanet has done the first annual Saki Awards, or that they're calling them the Sakademy Awards.
2600169	2601690	I think that's a really cute little pun there.
2601950	2603491	The Sakademy Awards.
2604112	2606853	Media Molecule has been giving out all these types of awards.
2607074	2610796	Did you know there's 1.5 million LittleBigPlanet levels right now?
2611156	2611997	Holy crap.
2612597	2612977	That's a lot.
2613498	2616300	How many stupid levels make up?
2616340	2619542	Probably 1.49 million really bad levels.
2619562	2621683	That's still a lot, though, if you have 100,000 good levels.
2621723	2622484	That's true, that's true.
2623925	2632751	Some of the awards that they gave out, Best Mashima Video, Best Visuals and Use of Special Effects, Best Use of Story in a Level, and all more.
2632771	2634612	The Best Visuals one was pretty awesome.
2634732	2640336	It was a post-apocalyptic, I think was the name of it, and it actually had...
2640976	2642157	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2660171	2661491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2681337	2685920	and put them on a separate planet or something or put them in a separate menu.
2686260	2688702	Something where I can go straight to the best.
2689403	2694006	Where I can weed through all the crap that's out there and just go straight to these levels I have to see.
2695972	2698934	I wonder if they had a category for best trophy whoring level.
2699194	2704436	Because remember when the game first came out, all the high-rated levels were like, earn seven trophies in 30 seconds!
2704897	2712260	I was looking at some of the other ones on there, because of course the Contra one won for best collaboration, which is awesome.
2713081	2715722	All the Contra levels, as it should have.
2717943	2719504	There was best...
2721681	2723182	Logic Device or something like that.
2723983	2724603	Or Computer.
2725084	2729427	And it was the LittleBigPlanet Calculator because that was really, really involved.
2731528	2734210	There was... I'm trying to think what some of the other ones were.
2734631	2736092	There was like a Best Community Project.
2736132	2737393	I didn't understand what that was.
2737413	2739014	I think it was just like tools.
2739114	2744278	Like they had logic tools that you could use for your machines and stuff.
2744798	2748081	But yeah, definitely check out the post-apocalyptic level because that looked pretty...
2748761	2749803	Thank you for watching!
2764924	2772066	At the same time, when I have been playing LittleBigPlanet recently, I've been checking out those new Pirates of the Caribbean levels, so I haven't had time to check out the Academy winners.
2772326	2772946	How'd you like those?
2773726	2774227	It was cute.
2774387	2781368	I didn't play a whole lot, so I can't really give you a full review yet, but I was kind of surprised that you can't stay underwater very long.
2781388	2785069	Are there items later that increase your breathing time and things I haven't gotten to yet?
2785590	2792712	You can get scuba gear that allows you to breathe underwater forever, so you can get that.
2792892	2794012	I figured that was there, yeah.
2795212	2798714	I did like how the water can raise and lower.
2798734	2805176	There was one part of the very first level where you can flood the town and then you bring the flood down.
2805196	2808037	That was kind of neat.
2808418	2816741	I just love the fact that LittleBigPlanet is still being supported and that they haven't taken that route that I think some developers would have and put all this in LittleBigPlanet 2.
2817461	2819802	They've really been supporting this one game.
2819822	2820242	It's...
2822023	2824084	A really good PlayStation 3 value, I gotta say.
2825285	2826525	Color me impressed.
2826565	2829927	I named it my game of the year last year, and I still stand by it.
2829947	2833908	I think that's one of the greatest games they've released in quite some time.
2835989	2837170	Maybe I'm just biased, I don't know.
2838190	2840411	Anyhow, moving on with more news, and we'll get to release dates.
2840471	2841532	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2842521	2846304	I have some news about Sonic Racing for 360.
2847765	2849807	Not Sonic R, just to clarify.
2850968	2854751	But there's actually going to be characters that you can use for Sonic Racing.
2855092	2858915	Namely, your avatars will be playable and Banjo-Kazooie.
2860277	2862138	Well, I really don't give a crap about Banjo.
2862318	2867399	I actually think it would be pretty cool to go ahead and use my avatar.
2867599	2875281	And the other characters in the game, too, are, of course, Sonic, Tails, Shadow, I from Super Monkey Ball, Samba.
2875301	2877162	That was in the Samba de Amigo Monkey.
2877302	2877662	Oh, cute.
2878802	2883683	Beat from Jet Set Radio, Alex Kidd, Billy Hatcher, and... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2883723	2885684	Sega is acknowledging Jet Set Radio?
2886224	2886565	Yes.
2887006	2888529	That's good, right?
2889671	2890693	Alex Kidd.
2891715	2892136	Oh, wow.
2892396	2894140	When was the last time we had an Alex Kidd game?
2894717	2898519	Billy Hatcher and Ryo Hazuki, the guy from Shenmue.
2900641	2904463	Wow, it's like Sega's throwing bones at all these fans.
2904743	2908045	Like, damn it, we need a new Jet Set future, Jet Set Radio.
2908085	2909266	Damn it, we need a new Shenmue.
2909286	2912908	And now they're teasing us with this silly little racing game.
2913168	2920052	Well, you remember when they teased us with having knights in that stupid eye toy game back when?
2920072	2920432	Oh, yeah.
2920472	2921233	Knights in the game?
2921733	2921813	No.
2922913	2932338	But they said that there's rumors, though, that other possibilities is Ulala and Akira from Virtua Fighter and Vice from Skies of Arcadia.
2932538	2933879	Now they're just being mean.
2934399	2937540	Like, we all know there's not going to be another Space Channel 5 game.
2937600	2938841	There could be.
2938861	2940602	Space Channel 5.
2940702	2945864	I really wish there would be, but they're just being mean by putting Ulala in the game.
2946025	2946825	That's just rude.
2947245	2950369	Space Michaels in the game.
2950529	2952951	If they put Pudding Dye in there, I'm going to scream.
2953692	2954653	Because she was my favorite.
2954673	2955354	I'm Pudding.
2956195	2956916	She was my favorite.
2957717	2959098	For me, sorry, it was Jaguar.
2959539	2960940	With his little group.
2962947	2963827	I bought steampunk stuff.
2992182	2993042	Thank you for watching!
3013248	3014689	Girl would have it in her band.
3014729	3016849	I think it was like the Taylor Swift microphone or something.
3017410	3021671	I bought that for my, you know, because I liked karaoke and all that stuff.
3022031	3025193	It was really funny and it made me laugh when my avatar was like dancing with it.
3025553	3030755	But then I was thinking like, okay, if I'm playing this racing game or whatever, you're not going to see that microphone shoved in the back of the car.
3032461	3033322	That'd be funny though.
3033822	3036164	Speaking of which, I completely forgot about that.
3036184	3042009	Remember that racing game that they had out that was free to download and then they have all those expansions you have to buy and stuff to it?
3042870	3043170	On 360?
3043731	3043971	Yeah.
3044051	3046273	Well, keep in mind I've been asleep for like the past five months on 360.
3046313	3048014	That came out like in July.
3048174	3048555	Oh, did it?
3049576	3050016	I think.
3051557	3051958	I don't know.
3052078	3053059	I don't even remember if it came out.
3053079	3053799	So many games, so little time.
3053819	3054139	I don't know.
3054179	3058343	Honestly, because... No, I don't know if it came out because I would have downloaded it because it would have been free.
3060084	3060405	I don't know.
3061550	3062771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3085464	3086886	So many games, so little time.
3086926	3089950	Keep in mind, we all have day jobs.
3090070	3094795	Your game sites, you like to go surf and all that, they get paid to play games eight hours a day and all that.
3095356	3095817	We don't do that.
3095837	3099221	We have to work in our free time, so sometimes we can't play everything.
3099782	3102225	And by the way, chat, there's a lot of folks in chat saying...
3103266	3104807	Like Misty says, Barbie crap?
3104867	3106929	I bought a cell phone and I got the free Chocobo.
3106989	3109451	I waste enough money on Rock Band download content.
3110171	3112993	Actdeft said I would have expected Disney stuff, but Barbie, come on Rob.
3113234	3114014	I wasn't being literal.
3114134	3119118	It wasn't literally Barbie, but I call it that because, I mean, it's basically the same thing.
3119158	3121560	It's like a Dresher Barbie doll, and there's no...
3122521	3124322	I did pay for Avatar content, did I tell you?
3124582	3124962	What'd you buy?
3124982	3126583	I got one of the steampunk outfits.
3126903	3127983	I actually have leftover points.
3128163	3129944	Do you have one of those ginormous helmets or something?
3130064	3134646	No, I got like the duster jacket with the kind of gypsy top.
3135966	3138727	But I'm actually planning on getting the rest of the steampunk set.
3138927	3141748	Because actually, I don't really buy much with my points.
3141848	3144969	Dan usually puts all the points on his account and buys the stuff for us.
3145610	3148951	So I was going to go ahead and get the rest of the steampunk outfit.
3148971	3150452	Because I think the stuff's cute.
3151412	3151512	Okay.
3152014	3153876	I have Sims stuff, what's the difference?
3154616	3181318	One of the games I didn't mention during my gaming week but I did play for a little while was 1 vs 100 and I was actually cracking up because sometimes it'll show these random people in the mob who get questions right or wrong and it cracks my shit up when I see this person wearing just like a t-shirt and jeans but they have one of those uber robot helmets on their avatar and it's like that looks hideous and 45,000 people just saw how stupid your avatar looks like
3182951	3186535	And they couldn't be happier Then again, I have a princess microphone, so who am I to judge?
3187597	3188237	Who am I to judge?
3190320	3197488	At least you didn't buy a fake cat I didn't buy a fake cat Alright, let's travel the world and look at some release dates If there are any
3197827	3198548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3216315	3243204	newer games though Bayonetta finally making its way out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week so definitely worth picking that one up Fast Food Panic on the Nintendo DS making its way out and not really gaming related but the Guinness Book of World Records Gamers Edition is making its way out to bookstands as well and you should at least thumb through it but I don't know if you should pay them for it you know
3243857	3244157	and DarkSakura.
3264022	3265463	Better than the Guinness Book of Records
3287293	3288694	Don't you know you're supposed to say twat?
3313922	3316146	That's it for releases, unfortunately.
3316586	3319731	You only have those magazines for the articles, of course, right?
3321233	3322936	Actually, the articles are really boring.
3324058	3327063	Some of the forums are funny, but the articles suck.
3328465	3331386	Alright, moving on, let's look at Japanese release dates.
3331446	3334307	How we go from that to Japanese release dates, I have no idea, but we do.
3334987	3342850	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, James Cameron's Avatar the game gets its Japanese localization from Ubisoft this week on the 7th of January.
3343250	3344251	That's when the games are coming out.
3344731	3347952	That is also making its way to the PlayStation 3, just so you know.
3349052	3353994	Also, I want to point out, speaking of Batman Arkham Asylum, that is finally making its way to Japan next week.
3354414	3356016	PSP, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Do you want...
3373133	3374394	Did you see the trailer for that?
3374854	3376175	I have seen little bits and pieces.
3376556	3380999	Oh, no, look, if you go to the website for it, the trailer is freaking amazing.
3381019	3382880	Then put it on the console.
3383000	3386602	Like, this is my biggest bitch about these portable games.
3386622	3394107	I actually want it for PSP so that I can... Did you hear this week, well, actually, yeah, earlier this week on the DSi, Oregon Trail came out.
3395548	3398170	Like old school Apple IIe or this new shit?
3398210	3398870	This new shit.
3398931	3399271	Pass.
3400552	3400852	Pass.
3403263	3410345	I'm like, you don't have direction keys on the DS in order to shoot.
3410405	3416367	In these new games, do you shoot five buffalo and then like, congratulations, you shot 3,400 pounds of food.
3416727	3418807	Unfortunately, you can only carry 100 back to the wagon.
3419528	3420388	I somehow doubt it.
3421848	3422488	I remember that.
3423349	3424049	Good times.
3425929	3431193	I was going to say, there's actually another Oregon Trail game that I linked in our show role.
3431533	3432053	You have to see.
3432113	3433434	It's Oregon Trail of Physics.
3434115	3435075	It's awesome.
3435376	3436796	The Oregon Trail of Physics?
3436937	3438398	No, Oregon Trail with Physics.
3438498	3439298	With Physics?
3439698	3440299	What is this?
3440419	3441900	Did it not make the show role tonight?
3442440	3443181	Then tell us about it.
3443741	3444322	It's this game.
3444362	3448746	It's not even really called the Oregon Trail, but it is exactly the Oregon Trail.
3449687	3452871	It's basically the Oregon Trail.
3453251	3457896	You stuff your cart full of crap and whatever you're carrying with you.
3458396	3462580	It's like combining the Oregon Trail with that sledding game.
3462600	3464422	I don't remember what it was.
3464462	3466044	You jump hills and stuff.
3467065	3479573	so your ox just start running down the hill and then you go off of it and fly and stuff and if you land upside down like people get injured stuff like that I've seen a flash game like that yeah I know what you're talking about so somebody skinned that with the Oregon Trail basically
3479898	3483220	Yeah, it's... Oh, what was it called here?
3483600	3486701	It is... Let's Go Find Eldorado.
3487081	3489042	How do you die of dysentery in the game?
3489082	3489723	Is that possible?
3490003	3490763	It is possible.
3490863	3494165	I've seen... There's a video of it, and I will link it.
3494205	3494985	Is it a Flash game?
3497286	3498387	It might be a Flash game.
3498567	3499007	I don't know.
3499147	3502568	I'm going to look into this while DarkSakura covers the UK releases.
3502608	3503429	It looks hilarious.
3504391	3508555	You know, it's funny, you were just saying, what was it called, The Road to El Dorado?
3509676	3513019	I was just watching The Mysterious Cities of Gold last night, so I thought that was funny.
3513899	3514560	Hello, Random!
3515080	3515941	It is Random!
3516021	3518343	Well, you know, you remember, it's on Hulu now, Rob.
3519424	3520445	The Mysterious Cities of Gold.
3521165	3523547	They have all this crazy stuff on Hulu.
3523607	3525209	Oh my god, Loki's showing me a picture of...
3528803	3529804	Bayonetta Bayonetta
3554778	3559540	Can't believe they didn't try to crank that out in time for Christmas, especially because it did get its release over there in Japan.
3559580	3561681	Maybe they're just hoping for big sales off of gift cards.
3561841	3562221	I don't know.
3564763	3565383	I don't know.
3565543	3565823	What?
3567164	3568884	I know, I'm very excited about this game.
3569365	3570725	Oh, here's a little YouTube.
3570745	3574367	Let me see if this... I don't know if this has sound effects or anything, but this is the Oregon Trail.
3579383	3582386	Sounds like a little frog croaking or something.
3582406	3583247	What the hell is that?
3583367	3583947	It's upside down.
3584868	3585649	Did it just fart?
3586149	3587511	People do get dysentery in that.
3587931	3588251	Do they?
3588311	3590033	Because, yeah, John Boy has a broken arm.
3590053	3592555	This game looks amazing.
3592635	3597580	I guess it's more like Excite Bike with the Oregon Trail.
3598080	3599261	Somebody has typhoid right now.
3599742	3601944	It's like extra physics physics.
3603085	3604646	Where is this game available at?
3604967	3605067	Uh...
3605552	3606413	I won it totally.
3606613	3607833	Ludumdare.com.
3607973	3610195	L-U-D-U-M-D-A-R-E.com.
3610335	3611335	You should post that in chat, Rob.
3612036	3613537	I will do that right now.
3614517	3614918	Good!
3615498	3617099	I'm excited that you're doing that, Rob.
3617139	3619100	Can we do more news while I'm posting that in chat?
3619620	3620601	Uh, Loki.
3623262	3623683	Okay.
3625044	3627265	Um, let's see, I got so distracted by...
3629295	3630496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3649972	3659059	They were saying that there's already some kind of interactive games on YouTube, kind of done with videos, sort of like your choose-your-own-adventure type stuff.
3659820	3675812	But they were saying that the patent-tiled web-based system for generation of interactive games based on digital videos was filed earlier this year, or I guess last year, and it was...
3678136	3688742	They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but it sounds like something that links videos together, creating different narratives and alternatives and different scenarios for the users.
3689042	3690503	So Marky Mark, create your own video?
3690523	3691343	Awesome!
3692324	3695966	Probably something so that you can create your own, kind of choose your own adventure stuff.
3696246	3702770	Although, I wouldn't be surprised if they did add casual games to YouTube or something like that, or you could just play little Flash games.
3703010	3704911	I mean, that would fit right in, I would think.
3706845	3707206	YouTube the Game
3735718	3736059	DarkSakura.com
3750292	3755734	What's not as weird, because there's a lot of folks that are really into classic games and respecting the classics and so forth.
3756635	3763318	There is a project going on at the Atari Museum where they're actually reconstructing a lot of the old proprietary chips.
3763658	3770562	Things from the 2600 and the VCS, also known as the Atari 5200 and Atari's old 8-bit computers.
3771342	3776745	They're actually using data that was recovered from old tapes used in the original manufacturing.
3777585	3784770	The Atari Museum's Kurt Vendel has noted that the project has a practical application besides just, you know, it being history.
3785210	3786270	What's the potential of this?
3786631	3796877	Well, doing the chips in smaller SMT packaging and potentially bringing back to life some of the later CMOS designs of combo chips, which could lead to a SOC or system on a chip.
3797597	3798959	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3813203	3816084	Yeah, I mean, it's basically like those flashback consoles.
3816104	3820365	Like, for example, you'll see a lot of Nintendos on a chip.
3820926	3825127	I mean, it's probably not one chip, but it's a few chips, but really shrunken down.
3825527	3831949	Like those little knockoff Nintendo systems and stuff that they sell at the mall that Nintendo gets pissed at.
3832409	3835451	Or the flea market.
3835551	3836951	Tons and tons of those things.
3837091	3837411	Oh, yeah.
3837491	3842133	Those are great for turning them into little, like, portable or arcade systems and stuff.
3842553	3842713	Yeah.
3844588	3846049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3870275	3876042	I'm sure it's worse for others than it was for me, but boy, going to one of those made me feel very old.
3877203	3883050	But I'm glad that that stuff will be preserved and hopefully made more portable to future generations.
3884306	3888969	Speaking of classics, we always like to take a moment to pay some tribute to classic games.
3890270	3894572	When DarkSakura takes a trip into the vault every week and pulls out a game that she says, you know what, folks?
3895013	3897714	You should be playing this game, or you should check out this game.
3897754	3903598	Maybe you didn't know about it before, but it's our classic video game of the week, and it's preserved in our Orange Lounge Radio Museum.
3903978	3904599	Forever!
3904779	3905539	Forever and ever.
3906320	3907120	Which we call the wiki.
3908921	3911583	So DarkSakura, what game are you lavishing praise upon this week?
3912481	3914082	Um, first of all, the wrong link.
3915784	3917305	Let me actually find the right link again.
3917485	3917765	Uh-oh.
3918186	3920187	Yeah, because this isn't the link that I posted in the thing.
3920868	3925131	Uh, might have just broke on its way or something, so don't know what to tell you there.
3929095	3930356	Okay, there we go.
3930736	3939283	Um, the game is, um, Choji Kyu Yo Sai Makros Oboete Imasuka, which is, Makros, do you remember love?
3940854	3943041	which of course we know there was a
3944358	3945078	An anime movie.
3945238	3946459	And actually, listen to the music for a second.
3948440	3950001	Do you hear the music?
3950821	3957064	That was the scramble music from the actual Macross movies.
3957124	3958024	Explosions!
3958864	3959545	Sorry, speaker.
3959685	3965547	It's a shooter based off of the Macross anime.
3966048	3970530	And this one actually has to do with sort of a... According to...
3971870	3990076	The creator Kawamori Shouji, that this is not an exact final word on what happened with the crew of the SDF-2 Mega Road 1, which was the ship that was taking everybody else to discover what was at the center of the galaxy.
3992637	3996479	This is just sort of like a dramatization about what might have happened.
3997240	4004223	But you basically, it shows you leaving Earth and fighting a bunch of Zentradi everywhere.
4004483	4009426	And it was actually a pretty cool game.
4009526	4010287	It's one of my favorites.
4011994	4020580	And they actually had new dialogue recorded for the game when it came out by Mari Iijima, who was Minmei's voice actor.
4021060	4024283	And yeah, Minmei is still annoying, but she's Minmei.
4025804	4027665	But lots of shooting.
4027705	4032828	You could lock on different enemies in foreground and everything.
4032868	4033429	It was pretty cool.
4033969	4038572	It came out on Saturn and it also came out on PlayStation and I actually have both copies.
4040113	4040613	Don't ask.
4040713	4043395	I came into them somehow or another for cheap.
4044395	4050819	And it really is, you know, I'd say for any Macross fan, it is the game you should have.
4051619	4053440	I've got actually a ton of Macross games.
4053460	4053841	I've got...
4056061	4058342	The Macross Plus game.
4058622	4060803	I have a Macross M3 for Dreamcast.
4061463	4064224	But of all of them, I think that this one is probably my favorite.
4064424	4065404	Well, I take that back.
4065464	4070466	There's one on PC Engine that I really like, but this one is the more easily accessible one that I like.
4072326	4076367	It's definitely one that any Macross and shooter fan should have.
4076808	4077788	I mean, is that not just epic?
4079791	4083072	I'm not as familiar with the anime series, but it certainly looks like a heck of a shooter.
4083272	4084552	We got it as Robotech, Rob.
4084712	4086452	Your plane is huge.
4086492	4088293	It takes up a pretty big chunk of the screen.
4088313	4089273	I'm kind of surprised there.
4089733	4091793	Well, it also transforms between different modes.
4092194	4096214	As you see, it's in the full-on robot mode.
4096234	4098635	There's a Gerwalk mode, which is like a halfway in between.
4101355	4103896	But this did come out over here as Robotech.
4104776	4106636	Gotcha.
4107077	4107817	It's pretty epic.
4108477	4109057	Pretty cool game.
4110097	4110378	Alright.
4111619	4114423	Well, there it is, folks, your classic game of the week.
4114904	4118048	Macross, do you remember love on the Saturday?
4119330	4119711	Check it out.
4122190	4124071	Oh, you know DarkSakura loves her Saturn games.
4124672	4126573	And we're starting off 2010 no differently.
4127093	4130576	We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back, we'll have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4130596	4137300	We've got some quick news for you this week, including what's latest and greatest on the Virtual Console and iPhone games and Rock Band.
4137720	4141803	And we do have some other news we're going to get into, including 8-bit NES developments.
4142083	4143064	Yes, believe it or not.
4143624	4147107	And video games meet obscure Winter Olympic sports.
4147307	4147867	I kid you not.
4148388	4150109	And, of course, listless...
4150629	4157114	Tonight's topic for listless, and if you've never done listless before, please, please join us in chat because the chat room plays a big, big role in this.
4157494	4158735	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4158775	4164199	Tonight's topic, thing I most want to happen in gaming in 2010.
4165100	4169503	This could get very interesting because as you know, sometimes we're serious and sometimes we're not.
4170564	4173466	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4179224	4181347	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4181367	4183691	We are live on this January the 3rd, 2010.
4183831	4188017	That's right, our first show of the new decade.
4188097	4194487	Well, okay, you could get into that whole argument that the decade doesn't really begin until it's a one because, you know, the first...
4194807	4195347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4211653	4212733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4238180	4241903	Especially, I think, what, in a couple weeks we've got CES, so, I mean, everybody needs that.
4241963	4242284	Oh, that's true.
4242584	4244565	There might be, there's sometimes a surprise or two.
4244605	4248389	I mean, CES is more of, like, the TVs and the home devices.
4248409	4250330	Well, it's technology, but, hey, you know.
4250931	4254534	There are some gaming things that come out of that, but, like, or you might see AIBO 2.
4255074	4255334	I mean.
4255354	4257756	Yeah, I don't think we'll see AIBO 2.
4257856	4259138	I don't think we will either, but you never know.
4259158	4259978	It doesn't bow well.
4259998	4260579	Yeah.
4261568	4262409	Outlook, not good.
4263010	4269636	By the way, Listless coming up later this hour as well, because somebody pointed out to me, you guys haven't done an OLR game in like a year.
4269856	4275041	And I'm like, you know, I don't think since we moved to Studio Dark Sakura have we done a single game.
4275341	4279125	And a lot of that is because we're in a tighter space now than we used to be, so we don't have a lot of guests in here.
4279165	4279505	It's very rare.
4279525	4279986	That will be changing.
4280366	4283429	That hopefully will be changing as we get more guests and etc.
4286141	4289483	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
4289883	4292484	Believe it or not, some things did happen, and we'll get into that.
4292504	4294405	And then we'll get into Twitter topics after the news.
4295106	4297647	Let those last few tweets come in on Twitter.
4297867	4299248	So let's do Rapid Fire first.
4299619	4303082	Well, we talked about in Part A how we've missed a lot of games that have been coming out.
4303382	4308306	Well, I know for a fact that I've missed a ton of stuff that's come out on Xbox Live Indie Games.
4308907	4310428	And here's a few games you may want to check out.
4311028	4318875	First off, we've got Office Politics, which is a game you can have for the large sum of 80 Microsoft Points, or $1.
4319155	4323619	And it's basically kind of an office sim.
4324940	4326421	I guess not really like a...
4327366	4328407	How much you speak on the internet?
4347196	4348836	Yep, all that fun stuff.
4349157	4350037	So check that out.
4350057	4351137	Ceiling Cat is watching you.
4351497	4352497	Available for a dollar.
4352858	4353618	That's a great price.
4355098	4356499	There's another game, Battle Beat.
4357059	4360620	It's a... Looks like almost a defense game.
4360780	4364661	Very similar to, say... Oh, I don't know.
4365101	4365201	Um...
4366906	4367626	Thanks for watching!
4383857	4385659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4406680	4417572	and this is also an Xbox game and it's these gerbils like in little blocks and stuff and they make funny faces when you stick bombs next to them.
4417712	4418453	Also a dollar.
4418473	4419935	Wait, wait, wait.
4420215	4422617	They make funny faces when you stick bombs next to them?
4422858	4423058	Yes.
4423458	4424840	You explode the gerbils?
4425521	4427902	Yes, it's a little bit like Boom Block.
4428022	4428742	How sad!
4430983	4432263	And it's just funny, though.
4432283	4433744	Hold on, is that a YouTube you're looking at there?
4433844	4434544	Yes, it is.
4434624	4440286	Okay, I've got... I know this is terrible radio looking at YouTubes, but I need to see what this is all about.
4440346	4450250	And maybe we'll hear some hideous noises through on... So there's all these little turbos, okay.
4450390	4452630	They're trapped in little blocks or something.
4453211	4454351	You put bombs by them.
4456773	4457754	You will kneel before Zod!
4481980	4485564	The people, oh yeah, that's right, because they were the people that ended up being the villains in the second movie.
4486105	4486685	Whatever.
4487486	4490810	That's what these gerbils look like, is they look like they're trapped in the magic mirror.
4491691	4492331	That's funny.
4495562	4500987	So yes, you have gerbils and you're supposed to be, I think, knocking them below a line or something like that.
4501748	4502408	And it's cute.
4502788	4509314	And you don't really injure them, but they get scared because they're being flung across the screen and you're detonating bombs next to them.
4509714	4510595	But hey, a dollar.
4510875	4513357	Once again, $1, 24 levels.
4513738	4523286	So, I mean, that's a great price for... Amaze Satsuma in our chatroom at chat.originalsradio.com thinks this might have been brought to us by PETA, People Exploding Tasty Animals.
4525807	4531919	That was from the chat, not from me Views and opinions do not necessarily reflect You laughed, you're going to hell too I did laugh
4533918	4537501	Other things not related to Xbox indie games.
4538242	4547592	Coming to the Wii, and this is talk about a blast from the past, Fast Draw Showdown looks like something that could be straight out of Mad Dog McCree.
4548333	4550695	And basically, kind of is.
4550815	4554999	It's actually coming from Digital Leisure, which I believe did Mad Dog McCree release.
4555600	4556361	Thanks for watching!
4576448	4580550	Back when they made Laserdisc games for the sake of making Laserdisc games and nothing more.
4580931	4581411	Pretty much.
4582051	4583372	Some of those games were pretty terrible.
4583732	4586133	Like the first CD-ROM games.
4586293	4588595	Remember when CD-ROMs were new on the computer?
4588695	4588955	Oh yeah.
4589055	4597300	And they made some shittacious, and I'm making up a new word there, shittacious games just because you could have movies.
4598365	4602487	Although there were some interesting ones in there too, like Return to Zork, I think was one of those games.
4602507	4603547	I miss Mega Race.
4603767	4605688	Didn't it have Don Knotts in it or something?
4605828	4606909	Fucking Don Knotts.
4607289	4607589	I don't know.
4607909	4608490	I think it did.
4608610	4608910	I don't know.
4610010	4610991	Didn't really play Mega Race.
4611011	4611731	That was more your thing.
4612091	4612731	I love Mega Race.
4612791	4617374	I think that game is on GameTap, but that's back when I was using GameTap when it was cooler.
4618234	4619294	I can't say it's there now.
4619374	4620275	I don't know.
4620355	4620955	I just don't know.
4621575	4627178	It was one of those games that really needed a two-speed CD-ROM, and I had an external...
4628106	4644203	Big Ass, Single Speed CD-ROM Disk Drive, so it ran kind of slow, and then later on, you know, when I got a newer computer and it had like a, was it a 16 speed CD-ROM drive, which was like lightning fast, you know, it popped in there and the game ran too fast.
4645416	4648777	Remember, uh, you know, or, well, I would like to see the WiiWare emulate.
4649058	4653299	Remember those, uh, speaking of shittacious, remember the, uh, hologram games we had?
4653819	4659982	Like the, uh, there was a western one, and then I think there was, I think there was only like two hologram games.
4660002	4664364	I didn't think there was a western one, I think there was a time-traveling one that you, they had the first levels of western.
4664424	4668265	Oh, okay, maybe that's what I'm thinking, because I could never get past the first level because those games controlled like butt.
4669066	4669786	Yes, they did.
4670868	4674771	I would like to see that crap on WiiWare just for no other reason than it fits.
4674791	4678713	Well, when we get our holographic games, I'm sure that'll be like some of the first of the important... I see, I see.
4678753	4690121	When we get to the holodeck, I'll be able to play that game all over again and all its... And then you can go, fuck this shit and throw it across the room because it's virtual and you can do that.
4690161	4697967	Hitstun in our chatroom at chat.orange.com wants to point out Mega Race 1 and 2 are on GOG.com and they run in DOSBox.
4699412	4699813	Awesome.
4700395	4707313	And I do think that they should make an indie game called Fuck This Shit where you throw controllers at things and that would be funny.
4709406	4710687	Especially if they're Wiimotes.
4711707	4716691	Because Nintendo is really trying hard to get away from that image of the Wiimotes going into televisions.
4717031	4717891	That would be hilarious.
4719453	4723755	And this week on the Rock Band Music Store... Sorry, real quick.
4723795	4725977	Do you think that would get on to Xbox Live Indie games?
4726057	4727178	A game called Fuck This Shit?
4727498	4730780	Well, you obviously would have to, you know... Freak this stuff!
4732481	4733202	Frack this...
4736775	4737295	Shoot.
4737596	4738116	Frack this.
4738196	4738536	Shoot.
4740778	4741318	I don't know.
4741398	4741978	Patent pending.
4743499	4744560	Rock Band this week.
4744680	4747042	Of course, we've talked about this for a few weeks now.
4747062	4747742	Different things coming.
4748402	4752685	Including the Paul McCartney download pack, which I saw commercials for this.
4753566	4758269	They are actually advertising download content on VH1 and stuff.
4758289	4758589	Really?
4758809	4759249	I didn't know that.
4759269	4760310	I was like, what?
4761298	4763319	It's Paul McCartney, so I guess maybe that's why.
4763359	4766140	Well, you know, it's kind of a big deal when it's Paul McCartney.
4766160	4768021	Three songs, I mean, come on.
4768921	4774283	But yeah, they've got Life Pack, including Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.
4775303	4777244	Each of those available for two bucks, 160 Microsoft points, or...
4779932	4780552	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4810373	4811994	Which, that's been pretty fun.
4833979	4836402	So somebody did kind of think about it.
4836422	4841468	I mean, the game isn't called Fuck This Shit, but there's... It probably will be after you play it.
4842288	4842909	Fuck this shit.
4842929	4843770	Why'd I pay for this?
4845072	4845352	Damn it.
4846735	4847395	Who knows, who knows.
4847775	4852678	Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about some other quick news topics this week.
4853178	4858660	Loki brought up Plants vs. Zombies earlier, and I know some rumors have come up before about the game coming over to iPhone.
4858680	4860081	Well, it does sound like it is happening.
4860461	4863902	It's supposed to be coming to the iPhone, and of course that means the iPod Touch as well.
4864363	4866423	Late January is what they're saying.
4866443	4868164	That's from PopCap's Facebook page.
4869305	4874167	No word yet if Apple's approval process will fuck all that shit up.
4875548	4879771	DJ David, and I always mispronounce his last name, Guetta, I think is how you say it.
4879871	4880672	David Guetta, of course.
4881012	4883454	He had a download pack available in DJ Hero.
4883495	4884475	You can play some of his songs.
4884836	4890761	And the odd thing about it is it's some of the rare songs in the games that aren't mixed with anything.
4891401	4894684	They're remixes of those songs, but they're not mashups.
4895164	4898868	There's very, very few songs in DJ Hero like that, but all those track pack songs are.
4898888	4899808	I should go back and play that.
4899828	4901550	I actually downloaded it and never played it.
4901650	4929164	Did you know the very last song in the game I don't think this is a spoiler The very very last thing you unlock is Herbie Hancock's Rocket With like all that insane scratching Yeah That's the last song that you get And it is hell Like it isn't mixed with anything Because the song by itself is Like when I first played it you know what I said Fuck this shit that's what I said It's the one song in the game I can't get more than like two stars on On hard
4930245	4934751	Anyhow, back to David Guetta, because I liked his songs quite a bit that were in the download pack.
4935031	4940118	Well, apparently he is actually working on what he called the number two version of the game.
4940598	4942100	I don't think he means the poop version.
4942140	4947067	I think he actually means DJ Hero 2, which you could read as some type of confirmation of
4947487	4950230	Thank you for watching!
4970931	4971252	Ogre Battle 64
4979844	4980344	Kirby Star Stacker
5008499	5026768	and Salamander and Parodius for the MSX because remember they get they get MSX over there which we have yet to get probably because those games aren't in English at all at all although I really wish we would get the MSX games because you know what that means we could get is Gartic
5028100	5033123	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
5033584	5034344	Some stuff.
5036165	5042650	We actually have a new trademark from Sega, Let's Go Island.
5044811	5048033	Which the theory is that it might be a sequel to Let's Go Jungle.
5049674	5049914	So...
5051875	5059119	Who knows, but basically the way that Let's Go Jungle was, was you had guns and you shot your way through the jungle.
5059579	5064682	It was... Though it's a potential, though, that this is going to be one for the Wii.
5065162	5065802	So it could be.
5066343	5066663	Who knows.
5068746	5076171	Also, Microsoft wants avatars to reflect actual physical characteristics.
5076331	5084316	They've put out a patent application for, quote, avatar individualized by physical characteristics.
5085117	5091761	So they want to eliminate the artificial look and make it look like someone actually really looks.
5091781	5093102	Okay.
5095219	5107429	I'm not really sure how they're going to pull that up, but they're basically saying that they want to have a bit more reality in the game and actually be able to portray people accurately.
5109211	5116277	And that they're basically going to be pulling actual health data, and you can spend points on it.
5117031	5127055	Yeah, there's some controversy behind this, because I seem to remember hearing somewhere that this ties into, like, you know, hey fatty, stop playing the game, basically.
5127155	5132897	Like, that that could be the next development, which would suck, because, you know, people should be able to do what they want.
5134447	5162240	well there's now well a pachinko game that is Castlevania it's Castlevania Pachislot which is a pachinko and slot machine and it has a story where you are Trevor Belmont challenging Dracula and being helped by Angela who's a sorceress and it actually you can buy the soundtrack to the game too it's pretty kinda
5164181	5165242	There's even a video of it.
5165262	5165802	That's funny.
5166803	5169004	Because you know there's a Gradius Pachinko.
5170626	5173988	I'm kind of surprised this is the first Castlevania Pachinko machine.
5174648	5181433	Well, there's also a Parodius one too that I've actually found a playthrough about.
5182234	5182974	This is pretty neat.
5184275	5188338	I would be surprised if this is the first because keep in mind that Konami does slot machines.
5190003	5190683	is a big business here.
5190703	5192324	It's actually got pretty cool graphics.
5192364	5195806	And I'm assuming it could beat pachinko machines over in Japan because we don't really see those here.
5195846	5198167	But I have seen Konami slot machines here in the US.
5198467	5200128	This is actually pretty hot.
5200948	5201148	Nice.
5202489	5204330	Why can't they actually do a good game like this?
5204990	5205831	That's what I was thinking.
5206751	5209112	That looks better than a lot of the games that have come out recently.
5209312	5209873	Like Judgment?
5211894	5214055	Yeah, like Judgment.
5214115	5215095	Let's go to the Twitter.
5215115	5218037	You know, Judgment would have been really good on the PlayStation 1.
5220486	5220946	Thanks for watching!
5236132	5236913	Thanks for watching!
5253646	5253926	All right, fine.
5254046	5255067	But I think Zelda will also be a big one.
5255107	5255187	So...
5278158	5280298	I don't think it has to be necessarily first party either.
5280339	5288440	I think, you know, when we bring up kind of these third party Activision and so forth, I think you could have something that's kind of on multiple systems because Modern Warfare was probably the biggest seller, right?
5289220	5290741	Yeah.
5290781	5292281	This year, and that was on multiple systems.
5293601	5294101	Let's see.
5294522	5302063	I'm going to Von Toxic on Twitter says, If Tinker isn't on your news list, you should mention it.
5302583	5305564	It's free on Games for Windows Live and it has achievements.
5306488	5310970	I don't know if Von Toxic might have something to do with this game, but hey, I'm off for free!
5311430	5315712	And yeah, that's Windows New Games On Demand thing, you know, kind of like their Steam competitor type thing.
5317152	5323935	Do these achievement points kind of blend together with my achievement points on Xbox Live?
5324015	5328797	I doubt they do, because I don't think the PC like Halo 2 had them, and I don't think they blend in.
5328837	5330797	Well, Grand Theft Auto 4 does.
5331097	5332038	They have achievements.
5332558	5332678	And...
5335762	5336183	I'm not sure.
5336243	5339086	I know it shows up when I play Grand Theft Auto 4.
5340188	5343472	And it's kind of pathetic because, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 has no protections on it.
5343552	5347998	Well, it had minimal protections on it, so you can cheat really easy and all of that stuff.
5349099	5351102	Well, it looks like kind of like a puzzly type of game.
5351142	5353124	It uses this little, like, kind of isometry.
5353144	5353565	It looks like...
5354969	5357310	Is this like some type of reincarnation of Devil's Dice?
5357330	5361392	Because I noticed it uses dice in kind of an isometric playing field there.
5361472	5361973	So I don't know.
5362013	5363513	I'll have to download this myself and check it out.
5363533	5364154	I'm all for free.
5364494	5367835	But I like some of these achievement names, like Smack My Switch Up.
5368616	5370017	Step 1, switch goes left.
5370157	5371417	Step 2, switch goes right.
5371497	5372458	Step 3, profit.
5373058	5375219	So whatever that means, that's 10 achievement points right there.
5376339	5379620	It's got to be more than Devil Dice, because I see dominoes, I see little targets.
5379961	5386723	This is clearly some type of little puzzle game based off toys you would find in a kid's room type of thing.
5387063	5391045	But that's Tinker, and I'm all for free, so I'll have to check that out for next week.
5395737	5401784	TigerClaw sent us a list of Xbox Live games for mobile phones.
5401924	5404186	I guess that's something being looked at.
5405228	5413697	He's linking us to an article from MTV's multiplayer blog, saying that Microsoft wants to do more between Xbox Live and Windows Mobile-enabled devices.
5414177	5415399	Of course, anything to...
5416239	5419201	Nickel and Dime at the iPhone and kind of get back at them for that.
5420022	5427047	Talking about avatars on the phones, being able to do Xbox Live, social media, multi-screen experiences.
5428228	5435553	They're hiring what's called a principal program manager that's going to drive the platform and bring Xbox Live enabled games to Windows Mobile.
5435893	5442137	You know when I hear this, I kind of think about like the whole like, remember the Fable pub games that tied into Fable 2?
5443218	5445280	I could see something like that happening with this.
5445300	5451384	You have a mobile game that kind of enhances an existing game but doesn't necessarily take the place of it, if that makes sense.
5453226	5457649	Especially if they tie it into one of their big franchises, I'm sure it could be quite the big thing.
5458370	5464194	Maren Marvel, a good friend of ours, says, Final Fantasy IV The After Years is a fun bit of nostalgia.
5464615	5468037	What other series would you play an After Years game for?
5468458	5468658	Me?
5468838	5469679	Final Fantasy VI.
5470828	5472349	I don't know, anything else you'd like to see?
5472409	5479294	Like a retro, sequel, episodic, nostalgic, tickle your nostalgia bone type of game?
5479614	5480495	For Final Fantasy?
5481416	5482016	Anything, really.
5482196	5486580	I mean, Final Fantasy 4, she happened to name Final Fantasy 6, but I don't think, I think we can name anything.
5486620	5487320	I'd like to see a new chip.
5487340	5488201	I'd like to see a new
5488911	5490811	I was thinking the same thing, DarkSakura, Chrono Trigger.
5491132	5492292	A good one.
5492512	5494272	Yeah, something in that same vein.
5494912	5500094	Ironically enough, I don't know if it would be after years because Chrono Trigger was all over the map, but that would be awesome.
5500414	5506955	I would like to see a new Jet Moto game.
5507616	5508716	It's old enough by now.
5509756	5513417	I was thinking more like a story kind of based thing, but I guess anything works.
5514062	5521110	Story-based game, uh... You know, these role-playing games that never really got fully realized, you know, maybe should have a sequel.
5521150	5523272	Let's see an actual Xenogears sequel.
5523393	5526796	Xenosaga, eh... Not so much.
5528578	5529700	Let's see, um...
5532816	5537417	I'm actually reading our chat room here on Pachinko machines.
5537477	5540338	I'm looking, kind of catching up on our chat room, chat.orangeonstranger.com.
5540678	5545459	Very interesting perspective from Akuma JP because he lives over in Japan and kind of gives us some perspective.
5545759	5547239	I know we have a couple folks that listen in Japan.
5547279	5547880	I think that's great.
5548600	5552121	He says, Pachinko and arcade is different store here in Tokyo.
5552441	5559362	Pachinko is bad because it's gambling and Pachinko can look good because the developer cost is different and the limit for developers is different too.
5559843	5561323	So Pachinko is mostly computers.
5562003	5564284	I didn't realize they separated that in Japan.
5565164	5567585	That pachinkos and arcade machines were kind of in different places.
5567605	5568365	I mean, it makes sense.
5568405	5573467	You don't have slot machines next to Street Fighter 4 here in the States.
5573767	5574788	But at the same time...
5576167	5582391	We have things that are practically like little kid gambling devices, but they give you tickets.
5582431	5583892	They don't give you money, they give you tickets.
5584273	5588155	And those have taken over arcades, sadly, in the past 10 years.
5588175	5589556	These arcades have kind of been dying out.
5589836	5592218	You see more and more ticket spitters, I call them.
5592498	5593319	You know, something like...
5593999	5604502	Hit the button when the wheel is in a certain spot and this one little sliver will give you the jackpot whereas the things around it only give you like four tickets and then you trade your tickets in for crap prizes.
5605002	5607003	Like that's kind of what we have instead of Pachinko.
5608243	5608783	So I don't know.
5610584	5610864	Let's see.
5610924	5615445	Also on the Twitter, Dan Shadow asks, What do you think of Bayonetta's sexiness?
5615586	5617246	Is the one-handed mode too much?
5617706	5619507	Is there really a one-handed mode or is that a joke?
5619587	5620667	It's a one-button mode.
5620727	5621247	Oh, I see.
5623628	5623708	And
5625540	5625980	Thanks for watching!
5647619	5653546	Kind of a show tip from Spazinator, wanting to know that... Hold on, it got cut off.
5653566	5654727	I've got to reload the Twitter here.
5655488	5656409	Live radio, folks.
5656489	5658171	Sometimes things screw up.
5659173	5662036	Because we got some late tweets and it threw everything off.
5662876	5665658	Spaznair says, here's an idea for an unofficial game.
5666018	5672742	While in a story, blurt out a random, odd, and unrelated thing to say to see if anyone is paying attention and notices.
5673182	5677005	I know you three like tangents and randomness, so here's the chance to essentially make a game of it.
5677565	5679346	As if this show doesn't get derailed enough.
5680106	5681267	Doesn't that kind of already happen?
5682368	5683728	Yeah, it's called this show.
5683869	5685489	I know, that's kind of what the show's based on.
5685509	5689792	I mean, I like where you're going with that, but that's kind of been the longest running game on this show.
5690412	5691273	So, there you go.
5692942	5698424	Dr. Noir says, how about suggestions for mobile games for smartphones other than the iPhone?
5698484	5698804	Thanks.
5699365	5702006	That's a tricky one for me to answer because I have an iPhone.
5702046	5703526	I know DarkSakura has an iPhone.
5703566	5704066	We're sheep.
5704527	5707788	Loki doesn't have an iPhone, but you don't really use a fancy phone, do you?
5708008	5709148	I hardly use my phone.
5709208	5710889	Yeah, your phone's never even on.
5710909	5712730	It's on all the time, actually.
5712750	5712850	Is it?
5713450	5714271	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5733160	5739246	Anyhow, so sadly, because of that, I would feel kind of ridiculous giving you other game recommendations when I haven't played any of them.
5739747	5742529	I will have to turn to the chat to help us answer that one.
5742569	5749416	Chat room, do you guys have any suggestions for Dr. Noir about what games he should be playing on a smartphone that's not an iPhone?
5750237	5751698	Because I would be curious about that.
5752740	5755462	Amiga777 in chat says, Y'all got iPhones?
5755602	5756703	I demand an OLR app.
5757458	5757738	PSP App
5779304	5780385	Caglom for BlackBerry
5806491	5810636	Deathwishing says, did you know that you can unlock a next-gen filter in Uncharted 2?
5810676	5811818	It just makes everything browner.
5811838	5811938	What?
5811958	5812699	I hadn't heard of that.
5824960	5826561	Is that just for a look?
5826641	5832264	It's a joke, probably, because their game is so colorful and vibrant and all the other games are kind of brown and murky.
5832884	5833525	I get it now.
5834505	5834845	Let's see.
5834945	5841009	Ray Iannami says, Eight on the Brakes DJ Max Technica machine now has the Platinum Crew online service.
5841469	5843190	That's a machine I haven't touched in a while.
5843230	5844971	I haven't really been to Roseville Golf Land in a while.
5844991	5846251	I remember they had one of those machines.
5846291	5847412	I don't even know if they still do.
5847972	5849993	That's pretty broken by now.
5851374	5854275	I guess there's some new songs and some stuff that was unlocked there.
5854355	5862217	So, kind of cool that there's still some arcades in America, at least somewhere, even if you have to go all the way to New Jersey to play them, that will do those cool little unlocks and online things.
5863178	5864498	So, apparently there was a huge line there.
5864938	5865558	Let's check that out.
5867259	5867499	Alright.
5867879	5870960	Anyhow, let's go ahead and move back into some gaming news.
5871320	5875321	Listless coming right up, but we have just a few more stories for you guys before we get there.
5876602	5876822	Yes.
5877462	5880003	Including, and this is kind of neat, a brand new
5881072	5883413	Battle Kid Fortress of Peril
5901122	5903044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5923447	5923908	Cartridge Release
5942908	5971265	But RetroZone, of course, if you haven't looked at their website in a while, they have wonderful things including reproductions of different games, including the Nintendo World Championships cartridge, the Nintendo College Tour cards, they even have Ultimate Frogger, some Homebrew Glider game, and one that didn't really make our show roll because it's a little late, an 8-bit Xmas cartridge which has a little light show that actually plays in there as well.
5971670	5972430	I heard about that.
5972470	5973631	That's trippy.
5973751	5975452	That's kind of a neat little Christmas decoration.
5975772	5978393	Yeah, so it's kind of neat.
5979934	5982756	The game itself, though, I'm not sure how much it's being offered for.
5983176	5988498	My guess is it's going to be probably around $40, which is a little expensive, but hey, you get a cartridge out of it.
5989859	5991760	Personally, I don't know.
5991900	5998783	It looks pretty hard, so that might be beneficial if you're looking for that, I guess.
5999404	5999684	I don't know.
6001118	6002138	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6033490	6034871	Oh, it does look very Mega Man-y.
6038774	6040055	Like, those are the boss spells and stuff.
6040435	6041336	It's different enough.
6042997	6044598	If it's a hack, it's a damn good one.
6044638	6047000	I mean, maybe they... Yeah, but this inventory thing?
6047020	6048321	That wouldn't have been in a Mega Man game.
6051123	6053645	Well, you technically did have a kind of inventory.
6054358	6055640	Yeah, but I don't know.
6055740	6065751	I don't see this as much of a hack, just as maybe like Mega Man was an inspiration and maybe even some of the stuff comes from it, but I don't know if I'd call it a ROM hack.
6065891	6067212	It looks like a ROM hack.
6067412	6067973	Alright, fine.
6068494	6069495	I guess there's only one way to tell.
6069795	6072476	There's some really, really good ROM hacks out there.
6072597	6072877	It looks cool.
6072897	6073237	It looks cool.
6073257	6080701	There's a ROM hack of Super Mario Brothers, the first one that actually looks completely different and has a lot of new features added into it.
6080861	6084263	So it's very possible that this is just a ROM hack.
6084863	6086424	I wouldn't be surprised.
6089724	6090464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6106970	6109031	I have a couple friends who are actually going from this area.
6109631	6111892	Seg, who's been on the show before, I know he's going out there.
6112372	6114133	And both of us have a friend in common.
6114153	6117614	In fact, the friend that introduced us, Amanda, is planning on going.
6117674	6119135	So I'm going to PAX East with a girl.
6119155	6119935	Yay, I'm going to have a date.
6120295	6122036	So I am looking at making that happening.
6122056	6125497	I just need to cross the T's and dot the I's.
6125897	6127198	Don't dot the T's or I won't be going.
6128318	6130259	But as soon as I have all the details on that, I'll let you know.
6130339	6132700	But I did promise I would try to make that work and it looks like it's going to happen.
6132820	6133140	Yay!
6136441	6140744	Also, in news, other news, talking about ROM hacks of sorts.
6141684	6148207	These are fan translations that I guess are at various types of stages right now.
6148648	6156031	Fatal Frame 4, this was a game that was not released over here, but they're doing a fan translation of it right now, and they're talking about doing voiceovers with it.
6156332	6162755	Apparently there's a fan translation that has translated 99% of the text, and they're going to do a patch soon so that you can play the game.
6163095	6164575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6183407	6183867	Yeah, that's true.
6184068	6184408	That's true.
6185189	6188271	Front Mission 5 is also doing a fan translation, and guess what?
6188391	6188992	It's done.
6189973	6206828	Front Mission was the... 2005, there was the fifth game that came out on the PlayStation 2, and apparently the Front Mission series translation project has taken this long, thousands of hours, 2,000 pages of dialogue to make this game, and it is already...
6207208	6212790	Available and there's even a movie floating around on YouTube where you can actually check it out and it's been subtitled by the group and everything.
6212830	6214331	That is freaking dedication.
6215331	6230657	You know, I remember many, many years ago when I was in college and that I think the very, very first major fan translation project that saw fruition was Final Fantasy V. I remember when that came out, that was a big freaking deal because it was like, wow, somebody has done what
6232322	6233263	Square refused to do.
6233443	6235686	Remember Seiken 3, also Seiken Densetsu 3.
6235886	6237928	That was probably the next big, big one that came out.
6237948	6242513	I mean, there were some little games in there that didn't have a lot of text, but yeah, then Seiken Densetsu 3 was a huge one.
6243935	6250002	They even went so far as to translating sprites in the game.
6250555	6259918	It's very interesting how far that's come, though, because those are all cartridge-based things where you hack sprites and you change some of the coding to change the kanji letters and the American letters and so forth.
6260558	6261658	Very interesting how far that's come.
6261678	6264399	When you're talking about a PlayStation 2 game, that's videos and shit.
6264439	6265920	That's hardcore.
6266160	6267420	No wonder it took so long to do it.
6267440	6268561	That is a labor of love.
6269441	6269941	No, I agree.
6270761	6271001	Wow.
6272962	6275943	Something that the company should have just paid some people to do, but I guess they didn't want to.
6277783	6279324	One more story from Jamie, then listless.
6280512	6281493	Dragon Quest Slime Bowling
6301894	6309196	You know, because it's got where you sort of guide it through different, you know, paths and try to land in the right place.
6309256	6311536	And then you've got like a bowling mode, it looks like.
6312857	6314477	It's just interesting.
6316398	6321319	And what a timely release, too, because we have the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics coming up.
6321639	6323999	Well, yeah, this looks like it might have been influenced.
6324620	6327280	I know you're all going to be glued to the tubes to watch curling.
6328060	6328721	Exciting stuff.
6329121	6329661	That's funny.
6330720	6334582	No, actually, you know, as much crap as I give curling, it's actually kind of interesting.
6334923	6345449	Like, I don't, maybe, maybe I'm just weird, but it's kind of neat to watch, because, like, sometimes those WTF sports are kind of, I don't know, they make for good watching.
6346069	6346570	I'll shut up now.
6347090	6350112	Let's, do you think you'd play that game, though, the DSI game?
6350452	6350652	No.
6353574	6353874	Fine.
6355695	6360058	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangehauntradio.com says, the OLR game could be about curling.
6361417	6362278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6384926	6386127	We're going to ring him up.
6386187	6389688	He's the man who hosts the show before us here on All Games Radio.
6390168	6396131	The Bobby Blackwolf Show is live at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern on Sunday nights right here at All Games Radio.
6396151	6396832	Bobby, are you there?
6397952	6398232	I am.
6398272	6398953	How are you guys doing?
6398993	6399193	Good.
6399233	6399873	How are you, Bobby?
6400733	6401434	I'm doing good.
6401654	6409658	Now, for those folks that do listen to us that haven't listened to your show before, something they ought to know is that you always have us on your show every week.
6409698	6412559	You kind of do what you call the daily show tease, right?
6414042	6415082	Yeah, exactly.
6415302	6421164	Where we get to do our little what's coming up on the Colbert Report segment at the end of the Daily Show.
6421204	6422765	It's kind of like a toss over there.
6422825	6433188	So you're always really good to us having us on the show every week, but unfortunately it doesn't really get to work in the reverse because nobody comes on after us on All Games Radio, so we rarely get to have you on.
6433849	6441051	We do read your comments from chat and so forth, but we're glad to have you here with us tonight to help us with the very first listless of the new decade.
6442671	6447094	I'm so happy It's me rambling That's all you need to know You do a really good job selling your show I just want to point that out
6461511	6475383	No, it's basically I go through some issues or things that are going on, and it's me talking and reading chatroom comments for the first 20, 25 minutes, and then I try to take phone calls from people for the last 25 minutes, and then I get to talk to you guys.
6475964	6485332	So it's basically just my take on things that I want to talk about in the games I'm interested in, and people like listening to it, so that's why I keep on doing it.
6485686	6500866	and you do this show yourself the Bobby Blackwolf show so you don't have anybody to really banter with but your listeners and that's a tough job I don't think people realize how difficult that is that means you have to kind of like actually read chat as you're trying to talk sometimes that's tricky
6502338	6506960	Well, no, it's I let dead air happen and then I edit that out of the podcast whenever I put them up.
6507240	6508280	We don't have to tell them the secret.
6510681	6511041	That's right.
6511922	6515183	But your show's getting some love there in our chat room from Kitsune.
6515243	6515983	Love Bobby's show.
6516023	6517203	Yes, Bobby does a very good show.
6517784	6522145	And if you get sick of the dick and fart jokes on our show, Bobby's a lot more serious too.
6522205	6523286	I should point that out.
6523326	6525186	Bobby keeps it family friendly on his show.
6525206	6528088	And why would you be getting sick of the dick and fart jokes is what I gotta say.
6529888	6531710	I'm saving them for you guys.
6532210	6533491	I have no problem with them.
6534692	6536734	I choose not to for that hour.
6537055	6537735	That's just fine.
6537955	6544101	If you want the suitable for broadcast video game podcast, definitely check out Bobby's show.
6544481	6546903	There's tons and tons of shows on the All Games Network.
6547323	6549485	It's growing exponentially.
6550826	6552227	Check it out at allgames.com.
6552748	6554890	Anyhow, you ready to play Listless tonight?
6555934	6558035	DarkSakura, Loki, and Bobby Blackwolf
6570942	6573344	We're going to go around and give our top three.
6573685	6576447	So four times three means we'll have a list of twelve.
6576968	6578149	Then comes the tricky part.
6578509	6582493	We all go around the room and we eliminate one thing from the list.
6582533	6591642	That takes us down to a list of eight, which our chat room will vote on to come up with the definitive list to answer this topic.
6591662	6592683	And tonight's topic is...
6593524	6621756	The thing I most want to happen in gaming in 2010 This can be serious, this can be silly, this can be low worthy, this can be Nobel Prize worthy Whatever you want to do, it's up to you What you guys think our listeners would want represented is the thing most wanted in gaming in 2010 So Bobby, my friend, I'm going to let you start, you're the guest tonight, we'll let you go first What would be your number three thing you most want to happen in 2010?
6623976	6625579	Mother 3 Localized and Released Legitimately
6637921	6640882	Mother 3 localized and released legitimately.
6640942	6641942	That's a damn good pick.
6642042	6643543	That's a hell of a way to start off.
6643563	6646583	I think that's something folks have been looking for for a long time, so very good.
6646943	6656326	By the way, make sure you are in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, because it is the chatters that ultimately take that list of eight and break it down to a list of the top three.
6656846	6658146	What a way to start us off.
6658166	6659327	A very serious answer there.
6659387	6661267	So, Loki, we'll go to you next.
6661547	6663408	What would be your number three pick?
6665045	6668472	I don't even know if this would be good, but I'm just going to say it.
6669454	6674986	I guess Grand Theft Auto 5 for Project Natal.
6679439	6681661	I don't even know if I want to do that.
6681781	6685623	Is that just the fanboy for Grand Theft Auto and you mixed with that?
6685783	6688105	You just really want to be able to slap a hoe for real.
6688145	6688785	Is that what it is?
6689046	6690487	You know, that might not be good at all.
6691567	6692748	I'm just thinking about that now.
6693068	6694029	That might be horrible.
6695029	6696590	Do you want to quickly change it?
6696631	6698432	I'm going to quickly change that.
6698512	6702634	Let's find something more appropriate for Project Natal here.
6703075	6703375	Okay.
6706144	6713986	I think it'd be funny to see that Milo kid become, like, a virtual child Sim in, uh, for Project Natal.
6715086	6716967	Because it'd be funny to torture that kid.
6717047	6719088	So, Milo becomes Sim baby?
6719368	6720128	Or what am I calling this?
6720148	6720648	Sim child.
6721068	6721468	Okay.
6727170	6728230	I'm so hungry!
6728710	6729990	Tough, you're not real.
6730851	6731471	Starve.
6732211	6735012	Okay, Milo becomes Sim child on Natal.
6735979	6740282	Okay, Loki, did you do your homework before tonight's show or are you just doing it in class?
6740342	6744824	Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number three pick?
6745005	6746105	A real Silent Hill game.
6747506	6749607	Ah, so none of this homecoming garbage, huh?
6750228	6753069	No, and even Shattered Memories isn't really Silent Hill.
6753189	6755871	It's more like, um, I don't want to spoil it.
6756552	6756812	I see.
6757212	6759894	Okay, so a real Silent Hill game, says DarkSakura.
6759934	6760174	Alright.
6761249	6766733	My number three pick is, funny enough, extremely similar to what DarkSakura picked, yet very different.
6767113	6768834	My number three pick is also a serious pick.
6769314	6778120	I want Akira Yamaoka, now that he's left Konami, I want him to start a development studio and announce a new survival horror franchise.
6778160	6787467	I mean, because obviously he can't do Silent Hill if Konami still has that, but I would like to see Akira Yamaoka start a development studio and announce a new survival horror franchise.
6788487	6790889	Loki, is that a game you'd like to see happen, or what?
6792170	6799614	I want to see this and I know everybody out there will agree Eye of Judgment finally sells 1 million units.
6822179	6824862	They'd have to actually start manufacturing them again.
6825002	6827785	But hey, he can do anything he wants.
6827945	6835172	Maybe they will have a new game this year or something where the interest in the old game just comes back.
6835212	6838656	Like Valkyria Chronicles took like six months to catch on.
6839016	6840858	So maybe this is like that where...
6842915	6845236	It takes six years to catch on, that's fine.
6845296	6849559	If it goes into Best Hits, Loki, those Best Hits copies are going to count.
6850060	6851521	Because it's still the same game.
6852601	6853722	Very true, that is true.
6853762	6855323	Alright, so we got something.
6855423	6858205	It's never going to happen because it has to sell a million copies.
6858706	6862008	It's what I want, that's what it's about.
6862028	6863329	It's what we all want, dammit.
6863769	6866856	You better get your wife starting on that Tingle outfit.
6866876	6867617	That's all I'm saying.
6867717	6868579	Jesus, so.
6868880	6869160	All right.
6869621	6870583	Loki, fine then.
6870603	6873730	What do you want as your number two thing you most want to see happen this year?
6874191	6875032	President Cat.
6877233	6878534	I hope by some act of...
6895549	6896189	I don't know what.
6896309	6897450	Seriously, think about it.
6897730	6900311	Look at Invader Zim.
6900551	6903452	Off TV, but they sell merchandise out the ass.
6903552	6904972	It's just crazy.
6905213	6906133	Can I just point this out?
6906213	6911595	I hope by some act of I don't know what, we get invited to Nintendo's press conference at E3 this year.
6912175	6918337	And somehow through another act of I don't know what, lol, haha, that is actually announced by Reggie on stage.
6918698	6922439	Listen carefully for the cackling from the audience, because it'll be me.
6924815	6925095	DarkSakura
6946469	6947250	Thank you for watching!
6965444	6965844	Keytar Hero
6995680	6996120	Elton John
7010262	7010742	All right, fine.
7010782	7011523	Guitar Hero.
7012224	7013985	All right.
7014085	7015066	That's the number two thing.
7015126	7020090	The number two thing I would like to see happen is also... Actually, funny enough, it has to do with Nintendo at E3.
7020731	7028397	The number two thing I would like to see happen this year is I want Reggie to apologize at E3 and then for effect, punch a kid in the face.
7030045	7030325	Yes!
7030605	7040889	Just to show that they are not about the kids anymore, Reggie's going to come out on stage and say, I am sorry that we've lost our focus, and then to prove it, he's going to punch a kid in the face.
7041450	7043631	That's the number two thing I want to see happen this year.
7045511	7046812	Wouldn't you like to see that happen, Loki?
7048152	7048793	Sure.
7050213	7050974	I guess.
7050994	7052774	That's not weird.
7053995	7054375	A face!
7055768	7062894	Yes, and actually, I'm not going to put this on the list, but Loki could punch the child in his Tingle outfit after announcing President Cat.
7062914	7063535	Hey, I would be down with it.
7066883	7067604	I know you would be.
7067704	7091661	Alright, so, so far, just to let you know where we're at in case you're just joining us, the list so far, thing we most want to see in 2010, Mother 3 localized and released, Milo becomes Sim Child on the tall, a real Silent Hill game, Akira Yamaoka starts a studio and does a new horror game, Eye of Judgment sells 1 million copies, President Cat for the Wii, Keytar Hero, and Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face.
7092381	7093862	All right, so now this is it.
7093882	7097603	The number one thing you want to see happen in gaming this year.
7098343	7099603	Bobby, what is it?
7099663	7100063	Number one.
7101624	7109286	Game companies everywhere realize that first-person shooters are oversaturating the market and begin to turn all those franchises into dating sims.
7113168	7113928	I approve.
7113968	7114688	That's a good one.
7114728	7116529	Okay, I'm going to have to shorten that.
7116589	7119329	So I'm going to put first-person shooters turned into dating sims.
7119410	7120590	But you all know what Bobby means.
7122677	7125299	What would be at the top of your list for that?
7127020	7131683	Well, something about the pink Spartan in Halo, you know, romancing her.
7131743	7132063	I don't know.
7132323	7132564	I see.
7132604	7134885	Okay, so first-person shooters turn to dating sims.
7134925	7135265	I like that.
7135285	7135586	That's good.
7136417	7138538	Alright, number one answer.
7138658	7140199	Loki, what would be your number one answer?
7140419	7144381	I don't really have anything that I could go with, I guess.
7144401	7146962	Because I didn't do my homework.
7147682	7151284	So... They do yell things in chat.
7151324	7153105	Sometimes chat works... Yeah, but I'm not reading chat.
7153145	7153645	Alright, fine.
7155166	7157047	And I knew that it's right
7175330	7182493	I hope Sony has another press conference that sparks a bunch of wonderful memes again, you know, like Ridge Razor.
7182673	7188035	In fact, I hope they have a giant enemy crab come out on stage to announce a game for Sony.
7189715	7190956	You know, to be in on the joke.
7191896	7194377	Or their next console could be shaped like a giant enemy crab, that'd be funny too.
7194397	7201900	Okay, since you need to pick one thing, I'm going to say Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference, like actually comes out on stage and presents something.
7202020	7202520	In a tuxedo.
7202540	7203060	In a tuxedo.
7204861	7206541	I'm not writing that, but you'll just know it's there.
7206581	7206821	Fine.
7207582	7210923	Alright, DarkSakura, it's your turn.
7211203	7214203	The numero uno thing you most want to happen in gaming in 2010.
7215324	7216324	Half-Life 2, Episode 3.
7219005	7219945	With the portal gun.
7220665	7221905	About fucking time, huh?
7222625	7224646	Well, it's supposed to come out anyway, but I want the portal gun in it.
7226010	7228051	Alright, a somewhat serious one.
7228671	7230251	Folks have been looking for this for a long time.
7230311	7231652	Half-Life 2 and Episode 3.
7231752	7236033	Well, dude, they're going to have the Borealis in it, which is the aperture ship.
7236853	7237953	Where's my portal gun?
7237993	7241654	They should just have a mash-up game with all the different Valve franchises together.
7241694	7246315	Like, you get the portal gun with zombies and, you know, the Team Fortress 2 guys.
7246375	7246956	Gary's mod.
7247556	7248016	That'd be awesome.
7248897	7249557	They have it.
7249658	7254083	But if Bobby's thing stays too, then Half-Life 2 will become a dating sim.
7255065	7255705	With a portal gun.
7255986	7258349	So I'm not sure how that's going to work, but it's going to be funny.
7258389	7259090	This date sucks.
7262614	7263115	Quick exit.
7266405	7267266	I like where this is going.
7267306	7267966	The gravity gun.
7268006	7268407	The gun!
7272170	7273431	Okay, my number one thing.
7274091	7279576	I have somewhat a controversial answer, but man, I would just... This would just make me so happy.
7280036	7283399	Like, I would just... I would cry tears of joy.
7283579	7284640	Would you pee with happiness?
7285261	7288043	Maybe, but, you know, in the toilet, because that's dirty otherwise.
7289304	7291666	I would just be so happy if this would actually happen.
7292006	7294288	The number one thing I would most like to see happen in gaming in 2010...
7295834	7296895	Xplay gets cancelled.
7297995	7298756	Thank you very much.
7300017	7300717	That would be sweet.
7300737	7302198	It's not that bad.
7305340	7315606	I was going to say that G4 gets cancelled altogether and replaced with the Seacrest Network, but I'm just... Because remember, I have to feel sorry for Xplay because they were part of Tech TV at one time, you know?
7316227	7322911	And so, like, I hate to see the last bit of good, you know, Tech TV die off, but...
7324967	7328693	I just have to admit, I'm just done with the reviews written by interns trying to be funny.
7328733	7333860	Maybe I'd like to see him return to, say, an out of ten scale instead of out of five.
7336159	7338901	I give Skye's answer 3 out of 5.
7358911	7381726	Mother 3 localized and released, Milo becomes Sim Child on Atal, a real Silent Hill game, Akira Yamaoka starts a studio and does a new horror game, Eye of Judgment sells 1 million copies, President Cat on the Wii, Keitar Hero, Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face, first person shooters turn into dating sims, Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 with a portal gun, and X-Play gets cancelled.
7382307	7388631	Bobby, unfortunately, it's part of the game, one of these has to go, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7390152	7391472	Get over it already?
7391492	7391652	Yeah.
7418683	7419603	Oh, sorry, Bobby.
7420103	7420383	You know what?
7420403	7422324	For what it's worth, Bobby, I really like that answer.
7422344	7422744	That was good.
7423804	7427325	Alright, but unfortunately, Loki is deemed unworthy of the list and therefore it is gone.
7428365	7432606	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7433766	7435487	First Person Shooters turned to Dating Sims.
7437527	7440308	Why did we bring Bobby on the show if we're just going to eliminate all his answers?
7441968	7445529	Because Dating Sims are... All you have to do is just go to Japan.
7445849	7446669	Everything's Dating Sim.
7447522	7448362	Oh, poor Bobby.
7448402	7449062	I'm sorry, Bobby.
7449342	7452943	Well, for what it's worth, Bobby, I'm going to leave your last one on there, because I liked it.
7453843	7462805	The one I am going to eliminate, though, the one that I think is not worthy of the list, Milo becomes Sim Child on Natal, because I don't even think Loki knew what that answer was.
7463025	7465106	So that's the one I'm eliminating from the list.
7465566	7468486	Just a way to torture that virtual kid.
7468646	7475488	Which, actually, if I think about it, I'm sure they're included in some sort of fable game, and I'll do just the same in that.
7475608	7475808	So...
7476448	7476769	All right.
7477289	7480353	Here it is, the eight that the chat room does get to vote on.
7480413	7484878	Remember, chatters, when you vote, you're going to see... Damn, I should have said Peter Molyneux jumps into a volcano.
7485018	7485719	That would have been better.
7485859	7486140	See?
7486500	7487441	I wouldn't have eliminated that.
7487802	7488643	All right, here it is, though.
7488683	7491286	These are the list as it stands.
7492087	7494129	Mother 3, localized and released.
7494730	7497755	Akira Yamaoka starts a studio and does a new horror game.
7498176	7499698	President Cat is on the Wii.
7500119	7501080	Keitar Hiro.
7501481	7503824	Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face.
7504305	7506489	Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference.
7506869	7509734	Half-Life 2 Episode 3 is finally released with a portal gun.
7510214	7512136	and Xplay gets cancelled.
7512416	7518041	To vote, send a private message to Sky with your number 1 and your number 2 answer.
7518141	7523765	If you don't label what's 1 and 2, I'm going to just assume the first one is your number 1 choice.
7523945	7531472	So place your vote now and we will tell you what the top 3 were a little later in the show.
7531932	7534955	And no Bobby, stop telling the chatters to add dating sims.
7535595	7536996	That's just the way the game works.
7537216	7538437	It's no longer on the list.
7539357	7540018	But nothing.
7540738	7541018	All right.
7541759	7542619	I'm going to be victorious.
7544100	7546222	Bobby, thank you so much, though, for playing the list tonight.
7546682	7549364	I think the Mother 3 one especially was a good one that I completely forgot about.
7549384	7550164	I totally am behind that one.
7550184	7550925	I am behind that, too.
7552966	7553406	Isn't it funny?
7553426	7555067	Your serious answer was the one that gets through.
7555808	7558610	Bobby, any other quick plugs for what's going on in your life?
7558650	7560651	You do another show, right, on Friday nights?
7560771	7562152	Tell us about that real quick before I let you go.
7562967	7563528	Friday Night Gaming
7581527	7583468	as our welcome back in 2010.
7584249	7592873	It's an audio podcast, but it doesn't really work as well because it's very video heavy, but we do it over on Ustream for three hours on Friday nights, fnglive.net.
7592913	7594734	We also take phone calls.
7594794	7595674	We have the chat room.
7596114	7601737	Basically, it's an extension of what I do on Sundays, but a little bit more free form, and there are dick and fart jokes in it.
7601980	7602901	Okay, excellent, excellent.
7602921	7604942	So when you need your dick and fart jokes on a Friday night.
7605022	7605582	So very good.
7605722	7609424	And you get a whole weekend because then Understation Live on Saturday nights, they do a lot of dick and fart jokes too.
7609464	7612666	So you can get it like every, you know, all through your weekend.
7612726	7614306	So, excellent.
7614667	7621070	Well, Bobby, thank you so much for joining us tonight and best of luck with your shows and we'll let you know what happens to the list, okay?
7621930	7622511	Alright, thank you.
7622551	7623671	Dating sims for everyone.
7623811	7624892	Alright, take care, Bobby.
7625592	7625932	Maybe in 2011.
7628208	7635632	All right, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf, who hosts his own show right before us here on All Games Radio.
7636092	7645597	That's about going to take us to calls and so forth, but not until we do a very important segment of our show while I tally up the listless votes.
7646037	7651960	It's the part of the show where you guys send us emails and we pick a few of our favorites and read them for you guys.
7652280	7653461	It's the mailbag segment.
7655202	7657283	Dark Sakura, what kind of emails do we have this week?
7658120	7658562	Just one.
7659565	7660348	All right.
7660468	7661210	One good one, I hope.
7661724	7667527	Well, um, we shall see if it's good, just gonna take me a moment to get it pulled up, that's all.
7668848	7672670	Um, it is, uh, I'll just start from the beginning.
7673171	7678234	Dear gamers and OLR crew, um, I'm not going to read the beginning of this.
7678934	7688259	You were right about the 360, it is gaming heaven, I've never been this immersed in a game since Pokemon Gold on a 15 hour road trip with constant grinding to get to level 100.
7689700	7696663	The three days before I went to the store, I was constantly switching games on my PSP since I decided to kick the Wii out of the gaming cave.
7697423	7700824	I was switching between GTA and Rainbow Six Vegas and Final Fantasy VI.
7701605	7710368	I finally went to the store, a local chain called Gamers, to get the used Xbox 360 Pro with a 20GB hard drive.
7711028	7718091	I knew what I was jumping into with the problems the system had, so I got a tier extended warranty with the dream of being the MLG-like
7718772	7721654	Tom, T-Squared, Taylor, whatever.
7723014	7728758	I picked up Halo 3 in the interest of getting some headbanging done while wailing on my plastic axe.
7728798	7734661	I got Guitar Hero Metallica with some Xbox Live points, a $1600 prepaid card.
7735421	7737743	I've played Halo 3 for 15 days and it was awesome.
7738851	7742874	I've also played Guitar Hero Metallica and gotten the easy achievements all the way first.
7743034	7750880	Then I played Hexic for a few hours and I'm having massive fun with this and my TV had no lag and was able to set it up to 1080i.
7751620	7758865	Then I popped in Bring It On and Death Note into the DVD drive and it upscaled the DVD to 1080i resolution.
7759006	7760887	My anime has never looked so good.
7761755	7764156	Thank you, Microsoft, for creating the Jesus Box.
7764757	7770019	Now the only three things missing to make my purchase complete is a wireless adapter, 12-month gold, and a headset.
7770400	7773601	Otherwise, this machine is the eyes of President Cat.
7773661	7774722	It's perfect.
7775282	7776903	Peace out, DSMaster26.
7778284	7778664	P.S.
7779164	7784007	This email is sponsored by Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato, the hottest teen stars.
7784607	7786869	I wish I'd be going out with all three from Disney.
7786929	7789050	Oh, by the way, leave Miley alone and don't criticize her.
7789070	7789530	She's perfect.
7791226	7792387	I can't believe I just said that.
7793368	7795350	I know, I'm like, did you really just say that on air?
7795591	7796432	You got duped.
7797313	7799495	Well, I'm reading the damn email.
7801217	7807463	Alright, so I only like half heard that email because I'm tallying the votes, so are there questions for us in there or what?
7808064	7809505	I'm seeing if there's anything else in here.
7809686	7809886	No.
7809906	7809946	No.
7813136	7817898	I would though, now I need to remember what type of headset that we have.
7817918	7823941	Because Dan has these cool, like I could sit next to him and not hear the Xbox at all headphones.
7825241	7825861	They're amazing.
7825901	7826842	They help me sleep at night.
7827442	7829003	They're the best present he's ever gotten me.
7830123	7832504	Well technically it's the best present he's ever bought in himself for me.
7834185	7837186	I do have though, a little story I could throw in in the interim.
7838499	7841044	Sure, but let me just quickly say, last call for listless votes.
7841064	7844351	You guys have one minute to get your listless votes in or they will not be counted.
7844471	7845553	One minute for listless votes.
7845674	7847497	Very heavy participation tonight.
7847517	7848519	We're going to have a good list tonight.
7850322	7877383	What was going on is basically these geeks, actually Team Osaka from the University of Osaka, submitted to the 2009 Internationally Genetically Engineered Machine Competition these engineered bacteria that produce fluorescent proteins and carotenoid pigments to make art out of them.
7878309	7881251	And they made one look like Mario.
7882332	7885154	They were calling them biobricks.
7886234	7890497	So there's a picture of Mario made out of bacteria.
7891838	7892799	It's bacteria.
7894180	7894780	That's freaky.
7894800	7897061	Genetically engineered bacteria.
7897802	7900164	I'm going to link the picture in the chat room.
7900644	7904466	I make genetically engineered next-gen biobricks.
7905427	7906868	They're kind of murky and brown, though.
7908314	7909114	Stop being gross.
7914155	7920417	Alright, we're going to get to the FUs of the week in just a moment here, but I was just putting the final touches there on tonight's list.
7921597	7925418	Damn it, right after I get them all tallied up, one more freaking vote comes in.
7925898	7926358	Damn you!
7927079	7930820	Okay, so that's live radio, folks.
7930900	7931460	What can you do?
7933200	7934881	That's another vote for the number one answer.
7934901	7936361	That's not really going to change things too much.
7939955	7940996	Sorry, live radio, folks.
7942236	7943817	We will get to the FUs in just a minute.
7944878	7946539	I posted the bacteria, Mario.
7951921	7952202	All right.
7953142	7955123	We'll get to the listless results in just a moment.
7955623	7957785	But we are first going to get to the FUs of the week.
7957885	7962047	And we actually have some angst to inspire our FUs of the week.
7962927	7965589	But before we can start ranting, we need to get our ranty music.
7965689	7967590	So please, Schleigwerk, take us away.
7983117	7986018	Here's something to inspire your ranting tonight in the gaming world.
7987098	7994761	It's another case of the media runs away with some idiot doing something with video games to make the media run away with games are bad, okay?
7995561	8002123	A nine-year-old boy apparently stabbed to death by a 25-year-old friend over a game of Tony Hawk.
8002643	8014591	You see, Anthony Maldonado was visiting his family in Harlem and they were playing the new PlayStation and the killer's name was Alejandro Morales, the 25-year-old, I suppose.
8014912	8022357	The boy's family left the 9-year-old in the care of Alejandro during the night while they were playing the Tony Hawk game and that's when he stabbed him in the chest.
8024488	8026649	The story goes on to say he was a friend.
8026689	8027829	I can't believe this happened.
8028530	8031271	Anthony was playing on PlayStation when his friend came in and stabbed him.
8031611	8033472	My grandson died over a video game.
8034492	8037073	I'm not so sure your grandson died over a video game.
8037133	8039754	It's just that you left him under the care of a fucking lunatic.
8040134	8043235	And to be fair, you may not have known he was a fucking lunatic.
8043936	8046317	That's very tragic that he ended up being a fucking lunatic.
8046757	8049958	But something tells me this really has nothing to do with video games.
8050658	8052139	This guy, Alejandro...
8053433	8054274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8081058	8086062	I've taken my vitamins and I feel, you know, still tired, so I'm just extra exhausted.
8087343	8087623	Yeah.
8089624	8089964	Loki?
8090505	8097530	Thank you to KFC for leaving me at the drive-thru window for about ten minutes while they... jacked off, I assume.
8098050	8100212	Because, um, then the manager... That's not butter!
8100292	8102453	The manager comes over and he's like, has anyone come and helped you yet?
8102493	8104235	I'm like, no, I've been sitting here for ten minutes.
8104255	8107457	He's like, oh shit, sorry, uh, here's your food.
8108718	8110019	I'm not gonna charge you for the full thing.
8110970	8111610	Oh, well, how nice.
8112270	8115832	Well, except I think he did, so... Whatever.
8116052	8117812	You didn't even get a free cookie for your troubles?
8118012	8118292	No.
8118412	8118792	Bastards.
8118853	8120933	But the chicken was good, so it is forgiven.
8121933	8122654	All is forgiven.
8123554	8124934	I don't really have a lot of FUs this week.
8124974	8127395	Just FU to my car for being ghetto.
8128015	8129176	It's so ghetto.
8130756	8132097	I will have a new car soon.
8132477	8132957	I have to.
8132997	8134357	I really don't have a choice at this point.
8135078	8135698	So FU to my car.
8136297	8137238	You do have a choice, Rob.
8137758	8138458	There's always a choice.
8138498	8143021	I do, I do, but it's starting to get... There is public transportation, Rob.
8143281	8144942	It's getting to borderline pathetic.
8145062	8149784	No, I'm not taking... I don't live in a city that has very good public transportation.
8149824	8150645	I don't live in New York.
8150725	8153366	I know, I wasn't really serious.
8153766	8154687	I live in Sacramento.
8156789	8160970	That is really about it for what we had scripted for tonight's show.
8161770	8168411	So we're going to go ahead and turn it over to last-minute stories right after I tell you who won the list list tonight.
8173872	8177352	Here it is, as voted by you, the chatters, the definitive.
8177372	8177873	And this is it.
8177893	8178933	There is no arguing.
8179513	8180653	There is no disputing.
8180713	8184054	This is the definitive list of what the public wants in the year 2010 in gaming.
8184534	8185614	Number three.
8187344	8191246	is they want Reggie to apologize at E3 and then punch a kid in the face.
8193066	8194067	So we all know he means it.
8195467	8196188	It's the only way.
8196488	8197168	It's the only way.
8197248	8198369	I won't believe him otherwise.
8199809	8204611	Number two, and I don't want to hear any of this blah, blah, blah, that it's a child, blah, blah, blah.
8205832	8206892	Just trust me.
8206932	8208673	There's lots of kids out there you've wanted to punch in the face.
8209393	8210413	Get a parent to sign off on it.
8211074	8211994	All right, number two.
8212414	8214775	The number two thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010...
8216756	8219780	Mother 3 is localized and released.
8220380	8222303	So Bobby gets the last laugh after all.
8222343	8223284	He ends up on the list there.
8223564	8226968	Mother 3 is localized and released is the number two answer on our list tonight.
8227348	8237700	And the number one thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010, according to our chatters, President Cat is finally released on the Wii.
8237720	8237780	Woo!
8240529	8241129	No surprise there.
8241149	8244812	And by the way, I just want to point out it wasn't even a freaking close vote tonight.
8244912	8246153	Usually these lists are kind of close.
8246513	8249495	President Cat won in a landslide vote.
8250016	8261464	I have a feeling, though, the chat room might be thinking that that means that then we would actually announce it at E3 and Loki would wear the Tingle costume, which technically wasn't part of the answer, but I just really like that.
8261684	8263405	and maybe that's what they were voting number one.
8263425	8263745	I don't know.
8263765	8264765	Does it give you the warm fuzzies?
8264985	8265385	It does.
8265605	8265986	It does.
8266326	8267206	And we'll see.
8267646	8269907	Hopefully this will be the year for President Cat.
8270247	8271648	100 copies, my ass.
8272548	8273188	All I have to say.
8273368	8275069	Only 100 copies sold.
8275129	8275429	Come on.
8276429	8276709	Come on.
8278450	8278730	All right.
8279970	8280591	So there you go.
8281091	8283892	There's your definitive top three list as voted by the chatters.
8283952	8286633	Bobby is still trying to dispute the dating sims thing in chat.
8287033	8287633	Let it go.
8289334	8289834	Let it go.
8290754	8291415	Step away.
8292296	8292856	Let it be.
8293777	8296941	Alright, now we'll do some last minute stories and we'll open up the Skype line.
8296961	8300805	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8300865	8303247	We'll get to your calls right after some last minute stories.
8303487	8303648	Loki.
8304113	8313058	Love, the procedurally generated MMO is starting off with some beta testing, and that's coming to us, I guess, on January 7th.
8314379	8320023	Until that time, I guess only registrants in the pay-to-play alpha test can log on, though, unfortunately.
8320603	8322544	But that's kind of neat, though.
8322824	8326126	The game looks interesting, though, because it's all procedurally generated.
8326987	8328408	Also, next week... Hold on, let me get to a call.
8328528	8329008	Save that thought.
8329909	8330769	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8330789	8331089	Who's this?
8332790	8333731	It's Ray Ayanami.
8334246	8335507	Hi, we're having a hard time hearing you.
8335527	8336987	Make sure you're speaking loud and clear into the phone.
8337007	8337368	Who's this?
8339889	8341149	It's Ray Iannami.
8341309	8341870	Much better.
8341950	8342890	Ray, what's on your mind, buddy?
8345812	8346332	Not much.
8346692	8355376	I got a bunch of Christmas money like last week, so I've been spending it on some games like Riding 4 and Jewelry Master Twinkle.
8356557	8357917	You've been playing Riding 4 and what?
8359758	8360939	Jewelry Master Twinkle.
8361679	8362660	Tell us... Basically, it's a...
8363957	8371345	X-Box, Live Indie Games, or there's a PC game called Tetris Meets Puzzle Fighter.
8372746	8374288	The original PC game is called Dormaster.
8387100	8390081	Um, 400 Microsoft points, or 5 US dollars.
8390602	8391082	Gotcha.
8391762	8393803	So, that's what's going on in your gaming world?
8393843	8396704	Have you, uh, you've had a chance to catch up on a lot of stuff over the holidays?
8398785	8402987	Um, yeah, I also got DJ Max 4 with positive quality additions.
8403347	8403608	Mm-hmm.
8404788	8415693	Admittedly, part of the reason I wanted to get it was because it doesn't have the stupid autocorrect feature of the newer DJ Max games, where if you hit the wrong note, it'll still give you credit for the note.
8420231	8426118	And I was able to log all the talks on it within a few days, and nothing too difficult.
8426819	8434208	And the charts are pretty easy, but then again, this is a game geared towards new players, so I don't hold a grudge against any business with that.
8436039	8437060	I haven't heard anything, and...
8460262	8467946	Even if there were plans to make a Titanic a port for home, it would be really hard considering the setup of the arcade game.
8468026	8475689	I mean, if we were to put it on DS, you would have to dumb down the experience since the DS can't support more than two fingerprints at once.
8477510	8479951	Do you think it might work on a motion control type thing?
8479991	8483813	Like maybe if it was pointing at the screen like on the Wii or Natal or something?
8483833	8485394	Or is that going to just change it too much?
8487199	8488279	They've probably changed it too much.
8488319	8491501	The Wii Remote would be like not the size enough for that kind of stuff.
8492761	8495302	Apparently, Escalator 2, which is also a cave shooter, is getting released soon by the
8513985	8520668	Also published by Cave and ported by M2, the same people behind Castlevania Adventure Rebirth, which did not last until I got it downloaded.
8522909	8525070	Out of curiosity, did you play Ikaruga this week too?
8525090	8526550	Because it seems like everybody else did but me.
8528051	8529412	I don't play Ikaruga.
8530212	8530712	Oh, is it?
8530732	8533693	I have it against Ikaruga, but I haven't touched it in years now.
8533853	8534113	I see.
8534234	8535114	Alright, fair enough.
8535734	8538135	I think you would be intensely pissed off by it.
8540456	8541056	Is there anything else?
8541096	8541437	Go ahead.
8543260	8551465	I try to play it just to survive, but then I keep hearing the robotic words going, one chain, one chain, and that pisses me off.
8551705	8554106	It reminds me how bad I am at chaining the game.
8556767	8558408	It's a very frustrating game.
8558428	8568574	You really have to... I think it's one of those ones that you have to have the experience of playing it so that you start realizing what's coming where, and then it's more just one of those technical games.
8570543	8574044	Yeah, it's, like, more memorization-based than, like, many other shooters.
8574804	8577464	Like, it's more memorization-based than just, like, scoring.
8577885	8580185	Not, like, in terms of survival, like, R-Type and such.
8581605	8587226	Well, R-Type, I still think, is a little bit less of a challenge than Ikaruga.
8588667	8599629	Speaking of R-Type, the R-Type dimensions on 360 can... I still refuse to play it because if I try to put it on my arcade stick, I...
8601091	8608335	I wouldn't be able to change the controls since A is below X, so I'd rather have to put my fingers in a rather awkward position just to be able to play.
8608935	8611617	Because A is the fire and X is to use the force pod.
8611637	8612857	I don't know.
8622856	8625058	I forgot my Street Fighter 4 stick.
8625158	8629781	I haven't played a single 360 shmup without it besides Omega 5.
8630541	8635825	It's kind of interesting how that Street Fighter 4 stick is really adaptable to lots of different games, isn't it?
8637846	8638227	Yeah.
8639908	8645091	I'm planning on eventually modifying it to have a different kind of stick.
8645111	8647833	I heard those are better for shmups and other types of games.
8653524	8659187	I just wish they'd release a better D-pad so we don't have to spend all this money on these fancy schmancy joysticks.
8659247	8661989	But hey, you know, whatever helps bring the experience in.
8662009	8664671	Even with the D-pad, I would have done this thing anyway.
8666231	8671054	Alright, well Ray, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you as always for the call and a variety of topics tonight.
8671214	8673216	And I hope you get all the shrubs you want in 2010, okay?
8675270	8675670	Hopefully.
8675870	8676450	Alright, later.
8677671	8678431	Bye.
8678551	8678951	Bye.
8678971	8681571	1-877-GAME-OLR Loki, I rudely cut you off earlier.
8681591	8683452	I apologize, but of course our listeners come first.
8683492	8683852	I'm sorry.
8684332	8684772	It's alright.
8685252	8689833	Sirius Sam HD is coming to Xbox Live this week.
8691774	8692814	That was the other thing I was going to say.
8693034	8694795	Alright, well, we got another call just in time.
8694835	8695775	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8695795	8696155	Who's this?
8698075	8699096	This is Spazinator.
8699296	8699876	Hi, Spazinator.
8699896	8700776	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8702673	8703914	A couple of quick things.
8703954	8705275	Sure.
8705555	8718101	Well, since you just got your 360 back, there was one game that I seriously recommend that you at least give it a try.
8718121	8723904	It came out after your original 360 broke.
8725705	8727766	It said Magic the Gathering 3.
8728622	8730546	Duel of the Paint Walkers
8733035	8734296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8761967	8764370	Spazinator, were you a card game player?
8764410	8767693	Did you play Magic as a card game or was this your first exposure to it?
8769354	8772977	Oh, I played it in high school just like you.
8774078	8786430	In fact, I was a sophomore when I started playing it and an older classmate of mine introduced me to the card game and I got hooked right away.
8787376	8799301	and I've been playing it all through high school up until I graduated and then once I hit college and no one around me played Magic the Galer and I kind of gave it up.
8801521	8805703	I tried to play season one Magic the Galer game.
8806543	8812906	It was loosely based on Magic but it wasn't totally faithful to the card game.
8813266	8813466	But
8814301	8819362	The Dextox Live game is, by comparison, damn good.
8819822	8826103	Yeah, I had an old, old version on the PC that was released probably around the same time I actually played the game.
8826123	8828244	Maybe by the time I was like a senior in high school or so forth.
8828564	8831164	So it's been like 95, 96 that this was actually released.
8832245	8835165	They had like an old PC one that was pretty darn good.
8835705	8836705	It had its flaws.
8836946	8838786	It wasn't quite as, like it really...
8839366	8839826	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8867936	8871737	What's the thing you like most about the Magic game?
8871797	8873958	Especially for somebody who maybe hasn't played the card game.
8874258	8876398	What do you think makes the game cool?
8878459	8892303	It's kind of hard to literally put into words, but it's like a combination of dumb luck, getting a lot of the cards that you need when you need them,
8893454	8901802	and then actually a little bit of know-how and strategy.
8901822	8916556	I can't think of any good analogies off the top of my head, but what I just said before probably fits the best that I can come up with.
8919895	8922898	By the way, let me just interject this real quick.
8922918	8926620	I'm sorry, because X-Link posted this in our chat room, and this is exactly what I was looking for.
8927040	8928461	It's Magic the Gathering.
8929282	8930263	This is what always confused me.
8930303	8932364	It was also called Duels of the Planewalkers.
8932724	8937908	It was released by Microprose in 1997, so a little later than I thought it was.
8938028	8945353	But yeah, I remember that you would get a big oversized card that came in the box that I thought was kind of funny with the game.
8945393	8946054	Yeah, so anyway...
8946334	8952355	And I totally used to use the Candelabra to bring it into my regular deck.
8952415	8958497	And they had an Astral set where a set of cards that were specifically in the game.
8958577	8960617	So this whole little thing.
8961678	8964138	Sorry, it was a whole little game that came out many years ago.
8964438	8965479	It was still good.
8965919	8967839	It was much different.
8967999	8971400	Rob, that totally reminded me of my other big thing of geekery.
8971620	8972080	Sure, please.
8972180	8974681	I was using that same card to bring Captain Picard into my deck.
8976201	8976961	How do you do that?
8977201	8986265	It was like two combinations of cards where you can bring any card, any, it was worded, any outside card and put it in your graveyard and then another one to recycle your graveyard into your deck.
8987565	8988426	That is crazy.
8988486	8990426	So, bring out Captain Picard.
8991307	8993207	And what would the random card do?
8993227	8994388	Did it get stats of any sort?
8994408	8998249	Well, I didn't have to cast anything because I didn't have anything to cast other than just lay him down.
8998949	9001430	So, I always would say he'd rally my troops.
9002271	9002531	Nice.
9003576	9005337	Okay, sorry for the bit of randomness, Spazinator.
9006338	9007898	What else is on your mind besides magic?
9009579	9010540	Two more quick hits.
9010660	9012601	Sure.
9012741	9017203	I know that you specifically aren't really too sports at all.
9018464	9032772	I don't know about DarkSakura or Loki or even any of the other listeners, but I happen to notice that over on the PlayStation Network store, specifically the video site,
9033274	9049487	They actually got some sports programming on there, like old NHL games, NBA games, NCAA football games, a little bit of everything over there.
9050808	9058735	I can't speak into whether or not they got the same thing over on the Xbox Live Marketplace or not.
9058775	9062118	It's been a while since I checked the video content over there, but...
9063490	9070094	If you happen to like watching sports and there's nothing good on regular TV, there's always that.
9070814	9079819	I just happened to recently buy an old hockey game and the Fiesta Bowl from 2009 just validated they were pretty good.
9085802	9090168	You know, and X-Link in chat kind of chimes in that the sports is just for the PSN.
9090188	9097217	I have to be honest, I don't surf the video marketplace very often because I have Netflix, and usually that kind of fills in my video needs.
9097677	9100801	But it's interesting that...
9102874	9129075	that that exists because you know if you saw like a really awesome play in a game or what have you I mean that's literally content on demand you know but I don't know I don't know how um it doesn't seem like that would be very popular to watch a game and download it like long after it's been played when you read about it on you know your favorite sports or see it on ESPN the next day but hey I guess if there's that one awesome play or something really epic happens in the game you can download it and watch it forever even though it would be on YouTube too
9130649	9131289	Yeah, true.
9131489	9137611	And, you know, granted, I'm not exactly the biggest sports fan out there.
9138031	9143313	I'm far from it, which is kind of weird because I'm from a sports-crazy city.
9143853	9145913	But, you know, it wasn't a great while.
9145953	9148734	Yeah, I do like to watch a game of some sort.
9149094	9151895	And I figured, kind of like, what the hell?
9151915	9153235	You know, I'll get that.
9153255	9154976	There's nothing on record TV.
9155616	9159117	You know, it's kind of like, you know, impulse buy, so...
9159778	9167565	You know what, if there's a buck to be made off of the game, and if they even make $50 off the encoding and what have you, they'll probably do it.
9168025	9169006	Quickly, what was your other thing?
9169026	9171288	You said you had one other thing, and then we've got to let you go to get more calls.
9172709	9176773	Yeah, he has a relatively minor bone to pick.
9176793	9181477	He was your number one pick for Listless.
9181977	9183138	Yeah, why is that?
9183839	9183939	Yeah.
9184645	9195911	Yeah, well, you know, Bobby kind of said what I was thinking, is that, you know, X-Play isn't nearly as bad as it may get up to.
9195931	9204775	You know, being a screener is not the greatest show there ever is or was, but, you know, it's not quite as bad as you may think.
9205576	9213500	You know, in fact, that's one of several sources I get my gaming news from, so...
9215320	9221470	Take it as you will, but, you know, it isn't all bad, though.
9222471	9229238	I might be digging up old, old stuff here, but let's not forget this is the show that thought Beatmania was newer than Guitar Hero.
9231720	9235083	Sometimes the quality of the show needs a little work.
9235203	9240227	Obviously, I'm picking on them because I can, but I don't know.
9240488	9245893	I think the quality of gaming television overall could be a little better if somebody would just try.
9247334	9247574	All right.
9249033	9250274	All right, fair enough.
9250574	9256456	All right, Spaznator, we've got to let you go, but take care and have a good one, okay?
9256476	9256876	Yep, you too.
9256896	9257376	Have a good one.
9276038	9276938	Blah, blah, blah.
9277119	9278439	This argument is years old.
9278479	9279000	It is what it is.
9279060	9279720	It ain't coming back.
9279800	9280861	Things ain't the way they used to be.
9280961	9282381	And that's just what we're going to have to deal with.
9282401	9284503	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9284583	9286223	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9286243	9290406	If you want to give us a call, we'll try to get at least one more call in before we close up shop tonight.
9290906	9292487	Do we have any other last minute stories, Loki?
9296069	9296629	Maybe.
9298527	9306128	Yeah, there's new Dragon Age Origins download content coming out on January 5th on PC and Xbox 360.
9306228	9309889	It's going to be coming out later in January on PlayStation 3.
9310289	9312049	It's a return of Ostagar.
9312489	9313450	Let me get to the phones.
9313490	9314350	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9314370	9314690	Who's this?
9315650	9317630	This is DSMaster26.
9317750	9319271	Hey, DSMaster, what's on your mind?
9320711	9324792	I've been pretty pumped about getting the 360s.
9327176	9329258	Probably the best game system I've ever owned since the PS2, frankly enough.
9329278	9329398	No, no.
9329418	9330018	I'm happy about getting a 360.
9330058	9330739	It was the email I read, Rob.
9330759	9334762	And no offense, but I was having a really hard time reading your email because you don't really use punctuation.
9354714	9355775	Oh, sorry.
9356075	9357756	I was kind of writing it on the quick.
9358176	9365721	Have you seen that Facebook group that's called There's a Big Difference Between Let's Eat, Grandma, and Let's Eat Grandma?
9366542	9370785	I need to join that, because I'm actually a member of like four different grammar forums.
9370845	9371565	You should look that one up.
9371585	9373246	Do you see the book, the calendar I bought?
9373807	9374828	Eat, Shoots, I get it.
9374868	9375768	Eat, Shoots, and Leaves, I get it.
9375808	9379511	I have not seen that, but...
9380859	9396148	If anything, I've been playing a whole lot of Halo 3 before Reach comes out and I'm probably going to pick up Halo 1 and 2 and 3 ODFT possibly when that comes out and try to gain up on the Halo story in a sense.
9397429	9399730	Are there still lots of people playing Halo 3 online?
9399930	9404393	Is it still as crazy popular as Halo 2 is still being played online like 5 years after it was out?
9406374	9409896	Yes, and there's still people playing Halo 2 if you can believe it.
9411067	9413189	And actually, apparently I read an article on Kotaku...
9426278	9431420	that said it's because of Halo 2 that we have the friend cap of 100 for the 360.
9432420	9433020	That's right.
9434180	9435461	I've heard this come up.
9435481	9437361	I think Bobby's discussed this on his show before.
9437381	9444183	I think I've heard him talk about it where the whole friend cap of 100, Halo 2 is to blame because people are still playing that.
9444223	9450525	So in order for them to break the 100 cap, they would essentially have to disable Halo 2, which I don't think anyone wants to happen anytime soon.
9450965	9454246	Let me ask you this, DS Master, because you're a big Halo fan.
9454966	9457868	What do you think a Halo Reach is on its way this year?
9457908	9458809	Are you excited for that?
9459650	9466234	Well, I'm not really a Halo fan, but I'm like, I wanted a really good first-person shooter on a console.
9467015	9474240	And after playing at my Troops Holiday Party for Boy Scouts, which we do every year, like, it was so much fun.
9474260	9478143	I was just like, holy crap, I'm finally getting the hang of this.
9478804	9484228	Playing a console FPS after playing Quake Live for nearly a year or two.
9486361	9494668	I think I've told this story on the show before, but the very first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception, and that's where I actually had a whole lot of fun, was shooting up the wedding party.
9494868	9497350	I shit you not, that's the first time I ever played Halo.
9498031	9498451	It was a good time.
9498491	9504276	Actually, our longest session was probably two hours, 49 minutes, and 19 seconds.
9504636	9505257	Good lord.
9507018	9512203	Then quickly, if you are into first-person shooters, what do you think about the idea of turning them all into dating sims?
9514588	9515129	Please.
9515509	9521436	I mean, it's enough of a dating sim with the girl gamers trying to hit up on the gamer guys on Xbox Live.
9522598	9522918	No kidding.
9523018	9523719	I mean, that is true.
9523739	9525181	And sorry if I'm shivering and whatnot.
9534742	9535803	It's cold in Nebraska.
9535923	9536564	It sucks.
9537184	9540246	You need to get shot with a hug gun, I think is what needs to happen.
9540507	9542888	You need to log into Halo and somebody needs to shoot you with a hug gun.
9543929	9544209	All right.
9544770	9549453	DS Master, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call and your email and so forth.
9549493	9550194	You take care, okay?
9551235	9551735	Peace out.
9551755	9552976	Keep the good shows rocking.
9553296	9553757	We'll try.
9553777	9554077	Later.
9557393	9559815	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9559855	9560795	Sorry those didn't get through.
9560815	9562056	But remember, you can send us an email.
9562096	9562516	It's okay.
9562677	9564458	I mean, there was only one in the email bag tonight.
9565098	9566459	And then the person got through on the phone anyway.
9566519	9567840	But we can't control it.
9567860	9568921	We don't have a call screener.
9570341	9571162	We can't afford one.
9571982	9572663	Maybe in the future.
9572763	9573063	We'll see.
9573784	9576525	Anyhow, we're going to start to close up shop here.
9576545	9578547	Because believe it or not, we've been on air for about three hours.
9579627	9582709	I know it might not feel like that on the podcast because we do a little break in the middle of live.
9582749	9584571	But it's still going to be a long show tonight.
9585171	9585711	And a good show.
9585771	9586632	Good first show of the year.
9587810	9588350	I found the best book.
9588370	9589110	It has nothing to do with games.
9589150	9590170	Well, books are important too.
9590190	9592291	I found the best book that's called Why Is Daddy in a Dress?
9592311	9593351	Answering Awkward Questions with Baby Animals.
9593371	9593871	This is the best.
9593911	9594191	Look, Rob.
9616141	9617862	Why is daddy in a dress?
9618402	9618802	Okay.
9619083	9620283	And here's one of the pages.
9621564	9623205	How much for a happy ending?
9623225	9623385	Wow.
9623445	9624105	It's a kitten.
9624125	9625886	You used to hate that when you were doing massage classes.
9625906	9630048	Well, that's why I was laughing because it just made me go, wow.
9630088	9631889	But it's cute with little kittens.
9632430	9640434	There's one with a little puppy that said, why does daddy look like the pool boy?
9640454	9640534	Yeah.
9643104	9647970	I gotta read this comment from Marissa, and I hope she doesn't mind me reading a private message publicly here on the show.
9647990	9648851	No, I told her to send it to you.
9649011	9649511	Okay, good.
9650372	9653536	She said that they were just having a discussion at her house about punctuation.
9653816	9659562	Capitalization is important too, because like, for instance, you might have, you know, capitalization could change this sentence.
9660443	9661905	Help your uncle jack off the horse.
9662305	9667529	Help your uncle jack off the horse as in you need samples for mating purposes or whatever.
9683712	9685573	Capitalization and punctuation are important.
9688816	9690237	I love those little kitten postcards.
9690257	9691018	Those are adorable.
9691979	9692960	I want them.
9693000	9696342	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's... Stop giggling.
9697624	9701207	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up the show tonight.
9701247	9703028	It's another great episode of Oral R in the Can.
9703789	9705010	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9707732	9709854	Hopefully I'll play Borderlands this week.
9712442	9736208	my final thought is hopefully I'll get to play one of the like 50 games that I have in my queue of games to play this week get to spend more time with that but I'll probably be too busy trying to finish Symphony of the Night and making progress in Gyromancer and Shadow Complex and eventually playing Morrowind too many things to do DarkSakura, your final thought tonight yeah
9740263	9740864	That's going to do it.
9741024	9744586	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting our show.
9765842	9766402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9792762	9794043	to help get you through your work week.
9794063	9795806	So enjoy that, guys, and we'll get better on that in 2010.
9796787	9800433	I know I've said that before, but you can kick my ass if I'm wrong this time.
9800773	9803457	All right, so anyway, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9803477	9806762	Thank you so much for DarkSakra, Loki, and myself.
9807622	9808302	We'll see you next week
9837315	9838122	See you next week!
