WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto the King

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, January 3rd, 2010

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
What could Google be planning for gaming?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
A brand new 8-bit NES game is about to be released

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And what in the world is a Wiiwa?

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
We are that show dedicated to video games

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
And with me as always, say hello to the one and only

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Always ready and alert as always, right?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Uh huh

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, exactly

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Hello

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
How you doing, Loki?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Doing fine

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I see you YouTubing something over there

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
What's going on?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm just looking at an auction for a bar top cavity

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Because it's hilarious how much they try to charge

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
For these things

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Like, they want $900 for this

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
You can get two full-size arcade games for that

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
These people are dumb

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
You know, one story that was given to us this week

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That didn't make our show roll tonight though

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Because I remember bringing this up on a previous show

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
But the big Metreon in San Francisco

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
They're selling all their cabinets

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And I know that story made gaming blogs this week

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
But I think I mentioned that on the show a couple weeks ago

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
When I was, or maybe about a month ago

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
When I was there at the Metreon

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
They're selling a bunch of cabinets

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, they also want too much for their DDR machine too

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I remember that they're beating me in a three

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
They only wanted a few hundred dollars for

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Or maybe it was, I don't remember

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Maybe it was a thousand or something

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
But I was seriously considering it

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
If I wasn't a stinking adult with stinking adult responsibilities

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I would have seriously considered it

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
But alas

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Another piece of my car broke this week

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And it made me realize, you know

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Probably before I indulge in the video game habit

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I probably ought to get a car

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Probably should

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Stupid responsibility

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh well

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Well, Rob, you are almost 75% to a new present

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Anyhow, let's uh

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Yes, that's right, because you're working on an MP3

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, I've since discovered that

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
The real player converter will convert to MP3

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Off stuff off YouTube

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
There's a lot of websites that do that too

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I've seen that happen

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
This is so much easier because it just runs in the background

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And it works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
So enjoy your gift of Angela Aki covers

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Sweet

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Anyhow

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And the types of stuff we've been playing

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I know maybe because of the holidays

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Not everyone's really been gaming

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't know

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
But we'll go around and check in with everybody

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Peggle-rific

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm playing through challenge mode on Peggle right now

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
And I've beaten three of the five point stages

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It's freaking hard

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
On the iPhone

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And then we had a bunch of

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Raiden 4 going on in the house last night

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And then they were all

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
No, let's watch Macross

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
So they were watching Macross

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Macross Frontier

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I actually dropped by randomly yesterday

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yes

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Because I wanted to show a friend the OLR studio

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And we had Sonic

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, you guys were watching Macross

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And I was kind of like, oh, anime

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
That I'm not familiar with

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Because I don't follow anime as closely as I think a lot of our listeners do

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't follow it nearly as much as I used to

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
But we have plenty of friends that do

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And Dan's like, oh, bring it over, let's see what's new

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Good times

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
They had Hetalia, which I love

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
That's the one where it's different personifications of countries

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So all the different countries are characters

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
And America is trying to solve everything through cheeseburgers

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And Japan is very soft-spoken

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And never gives a clear answer

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Dan's still playing the hell out of Borderlands, out of curiosity?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, pretty much

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
But he's actually played through

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Ikaruga the other night

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I was going to say, when I came over the other night

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
They were playing some Japanese shooter game on 360

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I wasn't sure if it was Triggerheart, Excellica

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I only glanced at it for a second

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It was Ikaruga? Okay

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Because they were actually watching playthroughs

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Of other people doing tricks

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So they decided they were going to do them themselves

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I think they watched some guy do a perfect playthrough of Ikaruga

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And decided that they wanted to do it

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Alright

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week? What did you do?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I too played Ikaruga on my arcade cabinet

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Because I was working on getting Naomi's stuff

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Random, okay

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
I was working on getting my Naomi and a Thomas Wave

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
And actually also my Zinc emulation running

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Zinc though doesn't seem to run very well

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
The loader that I have for it sucks

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So I have to do it by hand

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
But I tried playing Urguts

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
And that's pretty fun

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Except I wish the Japanese ROM would work

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Because I think the US one doesn't have Cloud in it

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yes it does

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It does?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Ask with Cloud and Tifa because I've played one

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Do I have to unlock it or something?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I do not remember because it's been a long time since I've played it

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
But I thought it was either that or time released

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Or that it's like some little trick you have to do

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
But yeah, I've played both of them in the American cabinet

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Well then I will have to mess around with that

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
But in the meantime I couldn't get any of the controls to work

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Even though I configured them correctly

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It's just being retarded

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
I did play a little bit of Thomas Wave

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Had a little bit of Dolphin Blue

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Which for those who aren't familiar

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Is another game that's very similar to Metal Slug

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Done by the creators of Metal Slug

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
And when you play the game you're like

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Oh wow, this is almost like Metal Slug

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Except they're riding dolphins

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So that was kind of fun

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And then I tried to get Marvel vs. Capcom 2 working

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
But I think it may be a little too much for my processor

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And the arcade cabinet

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Because it's only 2.2 GHz

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Whereas you probably need a little bit more than that

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So I actually have to overclock it since I can do that

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
So maybe that'll fix it

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Because right now the sound's a little laggy

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And it's kind of annoying

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Then let's see what else did I play

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Other than Ikaruga

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, Guilty Gear Iizuka

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Which is interesting because I didn't realize

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
That they had a four player Guilty Gear game

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
So that was neat

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Then other than arcade cabinet stuff

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I played through the rest of the Little Big Planet

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Pirates of the Caribbean level pack

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
And it was alright

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
It wasn't as cool as the Metal Gear Solid pack

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
But it was pretty good

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Still worth the five or six bucks that you have to pay for it

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
But still, how can you top guns?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I mean, it's tough

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So it's understandable

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Then of course more Grand Theft Auto

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Still no Borderlands

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Thought about it, but been working on the cabinet

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
So I haven't had a chance to play anything

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I have Borderlands

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I just haven't played it

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I've been sitting on it for weeks now

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Months now actually

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I'll eventually get around to it

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I'd like to play it too

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So if you don't ever crack open that copy

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Oh, it's cracked open

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It's ready to go

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I just haven't gotten a chance to do it yet

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
When are you bringing Bayonetta over for me?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
The damn thing's out this week, right?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
This week or next?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Very soon

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Hopefully, if your husband knows Jamie

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
He'll be bringing it home

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
It's pretty awesome

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
So yeah, definitely check that out this week

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, I think that's really

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I mean, last week we had some pretty epic

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Grand Theft Auto games

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Because of everybody being off

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Funny enough though, we actually were playing against people in the UK

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Because I guess it was probably evening over there in the UK when we were playing

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I think they're about eight hours ahead of us

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay, so they are about evening

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It was funny though

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Because we had some people playing

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And we can hear them over the headsets

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And they're, I'm gonna get

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm gonna get the call in the green

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
That little wanker

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
No wanker

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So I'm gonna get the green fella

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I like getting cussed at in

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I don't want to say other languages

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But other dialects, I guess you could say

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You know, getting called a poof

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And you know, all those other types of words

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
It was pretty brutal though

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I had 47 kills in 20 minutes

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
With a streak of 14

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And people were pissed

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So it was fun

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In fact, actually the second player

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Second place had half as many

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Actually less than half as many kills as I did

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So it was fun

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
So that's what I've been playing

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
All that fun stuff

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Awesome

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm just imagining all the little talk

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
On Grand Theft Auto

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
We don't talk back

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Because it's hard to wear headphones and a headset

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
At the same time

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So we just listen to it

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
And it's funny

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Has anyone invented that?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Like a third party?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
A headphone slash headset?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
They have

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
My actual new 5.1 headset

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Which by the way

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And I don't know why these headsets do this

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
But one of the channels is already cutting out on it

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Because I guess the cord is so heavy

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
That it's pulling it out a little bit

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm only getting that

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
One speaker

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Which is annoying

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But I've had other headsets do the same thing

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
But yeah, they have Turtle Beach headsets

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
But they're like $100

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I think the cheapest one you can get that has that built in

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Is like

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't know

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Maybe

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
$60

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But really what they need to come up with

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Excuse me

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Is a clip-on microphone or something like that

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
That you can just wear so you can talk

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Because you don't really need the headset to hear people talking

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Most games have a way you can listen to it

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Through your actual headphones

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
So

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
That's all you really need

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Is just that

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Because it's just really awkward the way it is

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Going to the chat room of course

SSJ100Matt says I thought Rob's British accent

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Is banned from the show

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I don't remember that getting an official banning

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
But fine it'll be my Welsh accent there

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Anyhow

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Going into

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It's not sing-songy enough

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I'll work on it

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
If my Japanese pronunciation got better

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Maybe I should resolve this year to work on my British accent

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I don't know

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I'll have to Skype some of our British listeners

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And say please teach me how to say cute things

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And you know I'll teach you

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Teach me how to speak English English

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Yes please teach me how to speak English

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I can't even do that on the show

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
If you've listened to the past two or three months of show

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't know if it's because I have to multitask a lot

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
While doing the show or what

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
But sometimes the things that come out of my mouth

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm like what did I say

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I just totally butchered the English language

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I need English lessons from an English person

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
That's what I need

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Anyhow

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
You know they do have those

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I want to say that it's

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
They actually have like British English

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
As you know a language learning system

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Like is that something I can get the Rosetta Stone for

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm serious I think they do have that

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I actually probably have that

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Since I downloaded all of them at some point

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Call it a hunch

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
But I think that was made for people

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
That don't have English as a first language

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
That maybe want to move to London

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Or those places you know

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But then you pick it up quick

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I stopped being a wanker

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
You can speak like them

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Stop being a wanker

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Alright let's see

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
My gaming week

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Actually I played a crap ton of games

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I know I usually get on here and like

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I played WoW

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
And I did play WoW

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I finally hit level 80 on my paladin

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Thank you very much

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Da da da da

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
So I did that

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Stop sighing over there DarkSakura

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
That was a yawn

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Sorry

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Well I didn't just play WoW

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I actually played a lot of games

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Because here you go

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Wake up for this DarkSakura

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
This is very important

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I have a 360 again

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That sounds like a personal problem

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Shut up

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Now after the whole like what

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Four or five months

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I haven't had one

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
It was like August 11th or something

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
That update came out

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
That borked my 360

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I finally have a new 360

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And I spent a lot of time

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Just catching up on stuff

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I just filled up my queue

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
With like Kix

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And Bubble Bobble Neo

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
And Rainbow Islands

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
None of these games

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I played really in depth

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
In fact oddly enough

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
The game I probably played more than anything

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I went back

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I just had this itching to play

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
It probably has something to do with the fact

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That that's like one of the best games ever made

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That I wanted to go back and play it

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And that I never really played it through to completion on 360

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
So I've been sinking a lot of time into that

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Also though

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Speaking of Castlevania and that whole

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
You know Metroid

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
And the exploration game

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
One game that just kind of wasn't on my radar last year

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Was Shadow Complex

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And I finally took the opportunity to play

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And I finally took the opportunity to download Shadow Complex

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
To my 360 and check it out

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And wow

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Did I miss that

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Like seriously

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
That game was kind of awesome

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And by kind of I mean really

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
It is like a Super Metroid

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Castlevania type exploration game

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
But a little more modernized you know

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
And part

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I gotta be honest

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Part of what kept me away from looking at that game before

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Is when I was looking at the screenshots and everything

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I was like

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Looks like a clancy

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Espionage kind of game

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And I'm not usually into those games

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I don't want to play a gun scope killing game

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I don't really like those kind of games

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I will admit

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
That was ignorant of me

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Very ignorant

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
But I finally got over it

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
And downloaded the game

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
And I had an awesome time with it

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
I am really wanting to play that game through to completion

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And I highly recommend it

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It was fun

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
I was impressed by how much they crammed into

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
An arcade download

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Because seriously

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
They could charge 30 bucks for this stuff on Blu-ray

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Or I'm sorry

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
It's 360

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
They could charge this on a DVD

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And put it in stores

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And most folks would be none the wiser

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
So

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I was very excited to play Shadow Complex

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I'll spend a little bit of time with Gyromancer

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Which I played on the PC a little bit ago

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
But one of my friends sat me down

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And kind of explained the game a little better

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Because I gotta admit the tutorial

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
The game kind of is very wordy

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Didn't make a whole lot of sense

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
But having it explained to me really helped

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Once I'm able to get over that hurdle

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Of thinking about the board

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Like it's regular Bejeweled

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And thinking of it like Bejeweled Twist

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
The game is very interesting

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
And I actually think it's a little more accessible

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Than Puzzle Quest

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Which was just

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Battle after battle

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
After micromanaging

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
After micromanaging

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Gyromancer does feel a little more straightforward

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Like there is a start any finish

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
And yes you have these maps

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
You can go back and play them

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
But there just seems to be

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't know

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I feel more accomplished playing Gyromancer

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Like I feel like I got nowhere in Puzzle Quest

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Because I didn't spend a hundred hours with it

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
But yeah

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm looking forward to spending more time with Gyromancer

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And you know one thing that a lot of folks asked

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
When I got the 360

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Because I had to do that mandatory tweet

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
From Twitter on the 360

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Where I said

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Hi I'm tweeting for my 360

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Because I think everybody did that tweet

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
When it first came out

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Didn't

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Well those that used Twitter anyway

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
That's what you do

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Did you even bother to look at it on the 360?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
No

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Well that's why

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Because I didn't care

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I have it on my computer

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I got to be honest

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
It's really nothing

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Like it's a frivolous silly thing on the 360

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
And probably is something most people look at only once

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I got to say I did play with Facebook a little bit too

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And I think Facebook looks hideous on the 360

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
I hate the way it's laid out

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Because they try to put Facebook in the Xbox crossbar format

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Which the more and more I use it

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The more and more I really don't like the NXC

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I just I love all the features

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I hate the layout

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Like what they had before

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I honestly think was better

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
But whatever

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
The cool thing about Facebook is that

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
You can find friends on Facebook

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
That are on 360

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And you can find friends on 360

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
That are on Facebook

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Like the gamer tags and names are linked

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
So like maybe I have people on my Xbox list

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
That I didn't have added on Facebook

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Or like for example

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Somehow I didn't have Tiara on my Xbox 360 list

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
But I found because she's on my Facebook

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That she had a gamer tag

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
So I sent her a friend request

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
So Tiara if you're listening

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Accept my friend request

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You're making me cry

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
And of course I had to play a little bit of last FM2

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I had to catch up on all this crap I missed

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I realized this is like months old

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
That it was all new to me

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
But anyway the Twitter response I got to my tweet

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
About hi for my 360 I have one again was

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Oh well guess your Playstation 3 is going to be collecting dust now huh?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
No I think

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Honestly this little bit of downtime

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Has really raised my respect for Sony

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Because I know we've given them a lot of crap on the show

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
And rightfully so

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Don't get me wrong

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I haven't suddenly said

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Sony has forgiven for everything they've done wrong

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
I think they made lots and lots of great improvements in 09

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
And you know there's things I look forward to from them in 2010

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And in fact there's going to be some cases

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Where it's 360 versus Playstation 3

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm going the route of Playstation 3

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
For example Final Fantasy 13

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I plan to buy that on Playstation 3

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Better controller

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I think the game was designed for that in the first place

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
That's just where I'm going

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Microsoft fans put down the hate mail

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Because there's some things I'm going to opt for on 360 as well

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
For instance a lot of the things that have online play

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I just know more people on 360

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
That's probably where I'll go with those games

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Plus I'm still playing a lot of DJ Hero

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
And that's on Playstation 3 for me

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
So I have to throw that out there too

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
I finally got the trophy for playing every song in the game at least once

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Even the songs I didn't want to play

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I finally played everything at least once

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
So making good progress there

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Let's see I'm going to our chatroom again

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Some people wondering what NXC was

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Because I just rattled that off

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah that's the new Xbox experience

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
That's the new interface they launched

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
When was that? Was that last holiday?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
That was about September of 2008

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
I think so

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
When they switched from what was called the Blades to this new system

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That I can't stand

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I cannot stand the new 360 layout

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I love it

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Sony fans, I'll give you that

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I think Playstation 3 makes a hell of a lot more sense

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Than 360 does to navigate around

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I actually think it's really simple how they have it set up

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
There's so much useless garbage in there

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Do you know how long it took me to figure out how to change my theme?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Like something that shouldn't be that hard

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Oh I have to go into Myself

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
And then it's there

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh it's not in the guide button

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
It's not in these other settings page

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh I have to do this and this

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I thought that made perfect sense for it to be there

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I mean if it's my theme it would be my preference

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
But there's nowhere on that box to say my preferences

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
In fact if you hit the guide button and go into preferences

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You get a bunch of console preferences

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
That have nothing to do with theme

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
But like parental guides and user ratings and things I thought I disabled

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That's not where I thought to go

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I like it better

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I like how it's laid out better

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I think that it makes a lot more sense the way it's laid out

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
The only thing that I don't like is just the ads

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I guess for the stuff that I don't care about

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
But really the stuff that I want to get to quickly

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I can get to very quickly

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And to be fair Sony has the ads too

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
So if I'm going to hate it on 360 I have to hate it on Sony

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
But I don't know the crossbar just works better for me

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Than NXT has been working

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
But to Microsoft's credit

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
They tend to upgrade their crap pretty fast

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
And maybe some of these things that I'm QQing about

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
They will fix on the next update

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Even though I think they're only doing them yearly now

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I'm not sure

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Anyhow

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I know I talked about a lot of games

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And really I didn't even talk about everything I played

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Because I went on a shopping spree on Steam

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Because they've been having their massive holiday sale

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I don't know if you guys have looked at this

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Dude I got Morrowind for five bucks yesterday

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Just because it was five bucks

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
And I liked Oblivion yet I never played Morrowind

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
So I was like I'm going to drop five bucks on it

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And I got Luminous last week

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And I think there was another game I bought too

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
That's the problem with this stinkin' Steam sale

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Is that yeah the games are only five bucks

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
But suddenly I bought four of them

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I dropped twenty

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
You've just been friended Rob

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yay! Did you get a message from Tiara?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
She's listening

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Thank you Tiara

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Now I'm going to kick your ass in Puzzle Fighter

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm just kidding

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Alright we'll rock band or something

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Anyhow that's it for my gaming week

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
So let's go to housekeeping

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Podcast listeners I know you thought we've neglected you

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And I'm sorry and that's my bad

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
That has nothing to do with Jamie or Matt

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That's my responsibility and I've really slacked on it over the holidays

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But I cracked the whip today

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I got all four shows from December up

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And we are caught up

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And one of my

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Although I don't like to make New Year's resolutions

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
One of my goals let's say for 2010

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Is to do Monday turnarounds on the shows

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So that those are up on the feeds on Monday

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So keep me on my toes

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Twitters and Facebookers

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
If I don't have the show up

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Tell me just quit playing WoW and get the damn show up

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It is by the way it is not as simple as

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Just clicking a button that says upload

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Because we do edit the show

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
We don't say edit, we don't edit content

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We don't really edit anything out unless there's

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Like a huge technical failure that causes the show

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
To go down for ten minutes or something

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
But we have to clean up the actual MP3s themselves

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Take out the little, you know

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
You're listening to all games radio and all that

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And the little stuff that gets in the master file

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And all that technical jumbo

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And then we have to string it together to one file

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because we can't put the music break up

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And put that all up so

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
It is a little more than just clicking a button that says upload

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Anyhow

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I'm not the technical jabber behind the show

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I do want to say one other bit of housekeeping

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I will not be here in two weeks

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I have a long weekend

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Martin Luther King is holiday for me

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
So I actually am taking a long weekend

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
To go to Seattle

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
There's nothing going on out there

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm just going to say hey

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And be a tourist for a little while

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I will not be here though because I'm coming home on Monday

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So I believe

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
One of our long time listeners

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And listened so long we just made him

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
One that Suya is cooking up a best of

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
That I'm hoping we'll be ready by that week

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
So that's very exciting

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Also later in tonight's show

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Listless is coming back

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
We haven't done Listless in forever

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
We're doing one tonight

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And our old pal Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Is going to join us

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Because he always has us on his show

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
But we never seem to get him on ours

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Because we're on after him

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
So there's no real tease at the end of the show

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Because we go off air at that point

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
To at least say thank you and let him participate

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
In our silly little game

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
But before we get to the games we get to the news

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Loki

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Yes there's a rumor

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Kind of evolving the

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Development of the Playstation 4

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Which you know

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
You know it's coming eventually

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And obviously they're probably

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
You know they started work on it

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The day after the Playstation 3 came out

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
So one of the

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Possible pieces of technology

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
That will be in the Playstation 4

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And possibly considered for

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
You know additional

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Units afterwards

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Would be this thing called

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Project Larrabee

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And what it is

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It's actually a

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
A piece of hardware

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Developed by Intel

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And it's kind of an architecture

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
That revolves around

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
A lot of CPU's that's for sure

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You know the

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Kind of diagram that they have

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
They have a bunch of different CPU cores

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Including this picture I think it's about

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
16 cores

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And each with their own

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Cache and kind of revolving

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Around this thing they call a ring bus

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Very cool looking

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And I guess it's

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Supposed to be

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Obviously very different than the cell

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Architecture that's available now

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I imagine since it's kind of being developed

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Around technology that's

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Around new multi-cell processors

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
That something like this wouldn't be

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Too

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Too hard to develop or too hard to

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Manufacture

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And this is coming from

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
PC Watch's

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Hirosinji Goto

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Naming some

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Unnamed sources

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Familiar with Intel's long waited Larrabee project

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And also

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Apparently Intel was

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Pursuing relationships with Microsoft and Nintendo

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
As well for their next gen consoles

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
So maybe this

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Technology might not be only in this

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You know Sony console

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And who knows if it's even going to be in the Sony console

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
But

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I don't know it's kind of neat

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And something like this you know

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
They could definitely scale it

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
To however many

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I guess processors they want in there

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
Akdeft in chat says breaking news PS4 is coming eventually

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Which I think is what a lot of us

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
That just kind of looked at the story went

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah okay so PS4 they're already planning some of the stuff for it

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Sure it's going to happen sometime

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
What would this really mean for the system

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I mean is this just a boost in power

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Is this

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
You know is this

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Vaporware like the emotion engine chip

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Or I mean what is this

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Well multi-processors like that I mean obviously

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
It's going to be the crunch everything from graphics

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
To physics

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
To game logic

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Whatever I mean so with this obviously

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
You're going to be able to push

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Better graphics you know

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Better physics in the games

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
You know more detailed

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Gameplay

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
You know better sound

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
You know a whole lot more detail in there

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Problem is though when you are able

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
To push that much details

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
You have to also create that much detail

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And then development costs rise

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And so on and so forth

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
So there is you know

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Kind of a

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Downside to everything

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That's how Nintendo is kind of getting around it

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Because their system isn't really pushing that

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You know great graphics

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Although there are companies that will try to kind of

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Squeeze every ounce of

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
You know power out of the Wii

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
You know you don't have to

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Because their console doesn't look that

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I mean there's only so much they can do

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Graphic wise in there so

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Kind of to let the gameplay

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Shine through but with Sony though

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You know it's really all about

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
Just trying to push

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Better graphics

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Better specs, better everything

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I mean that's really what they've been

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Doing from the get go

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
That's what they've been really pushing with

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
You know remember with the Playstation 3

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
They're like oh yeah all the games are going to come out 10EP

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Everything is going to run at 120 frames per second

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It's going to be super awesome

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You're just going to blow your load when you see anything on the screen

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
You know that type of stuff

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And obviously that didn't really happen

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I mean a lot of this stuff comes out now

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
720p, nothing is running at 120 frames per second

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I mean TV's

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Most TV's out there don't even

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You wouldn't be able to see that so

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Let me ask a weird like maybe tangent kind of question

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
That I don't even know if it has an easy answer

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
So I'm really posing this to Chad as well

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I know we say this a lot

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I've said this as a kid

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And I've said this growing up

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And I'm sure a lot of you did this too

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Like even back in the Nintendo days

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
8 bit NES days

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Dude games look so realistic now

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I don't know how they're going to look any better

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I mean it looks like a cartoon on my screen

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It's awesome right

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
We always kind of say that and then somehow they get better

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
But I really feel like we're at this point now

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Where like Playstation 3

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And Xbox 360

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Like the stuff that that renders

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Really is close to like DVD

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Blu-ray quality

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean what is left to improve

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
My eye cannot tell the difference

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That easily between 720p and 1080p

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
How are they going to justify

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
An upgrade to Playstation 4

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And the other thing too is

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I mean who knows what technology is going to be like

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
When the Playstation 4 comes out

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I mean how long did it take for them to develop

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
High definition and 720p

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And 1080p and so yeah it's only a few years

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I mean we have no idea

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
What technology is going to be like then

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
This kind of processor I wouldn't be surprised

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
If we see this in a future PC

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Processor or anything

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Where you can add

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Something beyond 4 cores

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
You can just add as many cores as you want

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I mean granted

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Chip might be bigger or you have multiple processors

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
In there and stuff but

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I don't know it's interesting

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I guess I have to admit

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
You have a pretty good argument there

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
The thing that it will do we haven't thought of yet

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Or it would already be in the system

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Or they are just making it to do things

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
That we haven't thought of yet

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
What about and this might be crazy talk

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
But especially with you know

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Avatar the movie having done so

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Well

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
At the box office being so well received

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Especially as the visuals I mean

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I haven't seen it yet myself and I know I ragged

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
On it but clearly I must have

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Been wrong because everybody I know has been raving

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
About the movie even if they don't like the story

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Everybody is pretty consistent with

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
But the visuals wow wow

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Wowie wow

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
You know is this whole 3D

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Thing where maybe games are going

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I actually do want to go see it in IMAX

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Take me with you

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Because I'm kind of wanting to see it now

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Like just so many people

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Are having such a big boner over it

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm like okay maybe I was wrong

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I'll go see the damn movie

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Let's go before I start school

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I could probably do that so we'll talk off air

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Anyhow I think I have

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
4 hours available on Thursday

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
This is right? 4 hours?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It's a James Cameron movie it's about 4 hours?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
2 and a half hours

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I have a free screen for it this week

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Or this week in 3D but I've already seen it

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Whoa

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'll go

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Give me your tickets

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I think it's on Tuesday

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Actually it is on Thursday

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Hey that's funny

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Maysatsuma in chat says

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The Playstation 4 will give you new eyes

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
To see its new better ultra graphics

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Dude you might be joking

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
But if we're talking 3D you gotta have those glasses

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Right? That's new eyes of a source

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Not really, well yeah

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You do need the glasses

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I could see something for

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Realty where it's just polarized glasses

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Those things are cheap

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I'd rather have that than $200 shutter glasses

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And I guess the old rule of thumb is

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Gaming has to get closer and closer

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
To the holodeck from Star Trek

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Is that every system

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Brings us one step closer to the holodeck

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And 3D glasses

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Will be a pretty big step in that direction

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Until eventually

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
My Playstation 6

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Is just a room in my house

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
That I walk into and you know computer

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Activate Final Fantasy

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Program and I am in the holodeck

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Basically

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
That's where gaming is headed right?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
At least that's how I imagined it

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Well you remember we did have the U-Force

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The U-Suck

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The U-Force

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
My friend had one of those

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
It did not work like you would think

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
In the advertisements that's for dang sure

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I've got one of the ones that came with

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh shoot

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
What was that game that was on

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Genesis and then on Sega CD

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The Activator

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
But now I can't remember the game

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It was a really cool game

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I will never forget when Loki took the Activator

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
The Para Para Paradise controller

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
No I thought about it

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Basically I just took it apart

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
No actually I didn't even take it apart

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I just threw it away

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Or I don't know what I'd do with that

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I was going to though

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Tigerclaw says people will use the holodeck

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
More than just for video games if you know what I mean

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
That's true there is the age old question

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
About any new peripheral or game device

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Or anything that is released

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That has to do with a piece of plastic

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
There is the age old question

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You have to ask

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Anytime you hear about a new peripheral

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Anytime you hear about something new being released

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
The question is

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
How long until someone puts their dick in it

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Not necessarily how long

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It's basically

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
As I've seen it before

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It's TTP

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Is there a website dedicated to this

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
No there isn't

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's basically

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
How long will someone create a penis with it

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Or put their penis in it

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And install Linux on it

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
That's the other question

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Or use it in conjunction with their penis

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
That's basically

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
For example

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The Wii Vitality sensor

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
How long until someone puts a penis into that

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
You know

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Xbox One is positive

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
LittleBigPlanet

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
How long until someone creates a penis in that

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
That was like milliseconds

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
There is a whole bunch of stuff like that

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
But I mean that is a good point

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
If we get to the holodeck

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
There's going to be guys that never leave the house

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I mean

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I hope the holodeck has a holo-bathroom

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Because people will live there

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
It's going to be strange

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Anyhow

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Alright hey

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Changing tones completely

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Something else that game devices do these days

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Is play movies

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
And obviously digital distribution is getting big

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
But some studios might have some second thoughts

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
This week Sony apparently

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Put the movie Armored

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Which is a new release that is playing in theaters right now

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I had not heard of this movie

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
But it looks like the bow-pow

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Action type of flick that I would not usually see

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It's Armored

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Is the movie

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And it's Matt Dillon

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And Laurence Fishburne

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
And Jean Renaud

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
And all these people

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Peter Petrelli is in it though

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I see him in the poster

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
The movie

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I don't know how it's doing at the box office

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I don't think it's in the top ten

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Because you've got Avatar

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And the Sherlock Holmes

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
And the freaking chipmunks

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
How did that happen?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
And all this

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Well Armored, despite the fact that it's not doing well in theaters

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Maybe this is not helping the case

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It was available for download on the Playstation Store this week

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
That's right

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You could actually download a movie

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Already in theaters

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Not just that, it was up for free

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I call that the internet

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Well yeah, but usually this type of thing is not like

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Officially done by Sony

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And to be honest

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
This really wasn't either

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It was of course

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Whoopsie

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Somebody accidentally put that thing up

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Long before it should have gone up

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
And put it up for the price of free

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But what I think is interesting about this

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I mean, yeah, haha, point and laugh

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
At Sony for whatever happened over this

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
But I find it interesting

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That this movie was all ready to go

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I mean, clearly

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
This was the case of somebody pushing the button too early

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Or pushing the wrong button

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And causing this movie to go up on the site way early

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
But it was already encoded

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
It was already sitting on a server waiting to be dumped

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
It was just waiting for someone to throw the switch

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I kind of find it interesting

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That the movies are at that point

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Where

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Nobody's waiting to

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Deliver the movie to the service

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And I realize

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I think this is one of Sony's studios that put the movie out

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So maybe that's part of the reason

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
But I mean

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Isn't that kind of weird

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
That it was sitting there on the store waiting to go

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Like, probably all these movies

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Are already sitting on the store

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
People knew how to hack in there

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Keep in mind that

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And this even goes back to the VHS days

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Is that there were often

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Screener copies available for awards ceremonies

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I actually had a copy of American Pie

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Not American Pie

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
American Beauty

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
When

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
No, I take that back, I take that back

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It was Titanic is what I had

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I had a screening version of Titanic

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
When it had just gotten out of the theater

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Which was the only way I was going to see it

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
It was for free

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah, a really good friend of mine who may or may not be sitting in this room

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Used to get those screener copies all the time

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
No, not those kind of screener copies

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Not the review screeners

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
The actual

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
For your consideration

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Oscar screeners

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
They have screen copies of movies

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Like, literally right, sometimes even before they come out

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
We watch Snakes on a Plane

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
At my work

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Right before we went to theaters

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Yay, but you know

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I saw that at Disneyland

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's done, you know, it can be done

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah, but I don't think Playstation 3

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Is being used as a screening service

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
It's kind of interesting if it could be

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I'm kind of surprised

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
With piracy and everything going on

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm kind of surprised they don't have a device

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It'll be funny if that copy gets ripped

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
And just, you know, dumped

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I'm sure it already happened

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It happened long before you thought of it

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Here's the thing though

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I don't care about that movie at all

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
If I saw it for free

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I'd be like, nope, still don't want to watch it

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Sorry

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I have better things to do

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
For an hour and a half

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, but still

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I'm gonna say call like weird on the whole

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
You know, it was up on the marketplace

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Long before it should have been

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Right?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
That does kind of go without saying

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Well, I'm sure somebody's gonna get a write-up

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Over that one

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
We'll see what happens now

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Someone's probably pissing their pants

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Probably already fired

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Well, how about

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I think this is strange news at all

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
But Final Fantasy 13 sales have actually decreased

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
From how they were during the release

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It actually

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I don't see why that's a really big thing

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Because, I mean

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Just about when anything comes out

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Especially something big like that

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Everyone's gonna be picking up their copy during the first week

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
It had a million plus release day

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Broke records for the first week

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And then it

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Basically dropped

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
About a million units

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Into the second week

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
It did take a dip

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Because everyone's already bought it

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Also, Squeenix

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Is pretty much like

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
When it gets the worldwide release

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
We're gonna hit our numbers

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
So they're not too worried about it

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I think another thing, especially with Final Fantasy 13

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Dude, they released it the week before Christmas

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
So of course the second week

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I mean, I don't know how big

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Of a holiday Christmas is in Japan

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Compared to here, I'm imagining it's not quite the same

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Big deal and same shopping patterns

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
That we have here

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
But, you know, still

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That's gotta have some impact

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
You don't really have the amount of holiday purchasing

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Going on in the second week

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
When you release your game the week before

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
A big holiday, right?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I'm sure that's a part of it too

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
But I kinda get where this is going

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
They talk about this in movies a lot

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
And the late drop off can usually tell you

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Like the longevity of a movie

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Sometimes you have these sequels that come out

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And they drop off huge in the second week

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And that means the movie's probably not gonna do very well

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Even if it had a good weekend

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
But other movies like, well, Avatar

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
For example

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Is not showing a lot of signs of slowing down

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I don't think it's gonna have the longevity of a movie

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Like Titanic

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
But it's been dropping off very slowly

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
In its first few weeks of release

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And doesn't look like it's gonna slow down

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
The Oscar season gets rip roaring

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
So, you know, I think

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
A lot of game companies like to see that happen

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
With a game

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
But yeah, Final Fantasy, you sort of expect this is gonna happen

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Most Final Fantasy fanboys and girls are pretty rabid

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
They go out and buy it the first day

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And, you know, you're not gonna see the same

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Type of sales the second and third week

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I think the same thing's gonna happen here in the US

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And in Europe

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Huge first week sales, huge drop off second week

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
90% drop off second week

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And unfortunately they're just not releasing it

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
In a time like Christmas

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Where it's gonna sell consistently

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
You know, March is kind of a weird month

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
They should have already had it ready

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Well, we'll see

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Alright, so other things

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You know

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Might cause the drop off of Final Fantasy 13

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Would be

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Wiiwa

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Okay, well maybe not

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
But, um

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Wiiwa is this thing

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I think I talked about on the show before

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Where I got my Cage Match song

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
D-A-N-C-E

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
From

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
At least the idea for it

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Basically, Wiiwa is a brand new game that's coming out

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
And

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
It's using a unique

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Kind of a

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Controller attachment

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Basically it's this big stuffed animal

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I guess it would be a Wiiwa

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
That you shove the remote into

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
And you kind of

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Walk it around and jump

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And do all sorts of weird stuff with it

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
To control the character in game

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
It's like a

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Muppet, basically, you have your own Muppet

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Something like that, yeah

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You shove your Wiimote up its ass

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And you can make it dance and sing

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
So, um

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It looks neat

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I guess, I don't know

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
What kind of game is it?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Is it a Pet Sim game? Is it like an action game?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
No, it's like an action game

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
It's like something you'd see from Rare or something even

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Just kind of a little

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Platformer game where you walk around and you sneak up

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
On enemies and stuff like that

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
They have little mini games in there

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Including one that I guess the Wiiwa has these

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Bungee cord things on it

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Where you can fling it into the air

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And you kind of do that

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Almost like a spring

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I'm pulling up a little video here in studio

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Courtesy of our chat room

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Wow

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I just crashed the Bandicoot

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Oh, you put the Wiimote in its mouth

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
So you force feed it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Okay

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Oh, so you have to like

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Shake the thing around

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
That's kind of cute

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Back and forth and stuff

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That's adorable

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It is kind of cute, like I noticed that

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
It's not aimed at adults

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
They have a little six year old kid

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
In the video

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You're sneaking up and then

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You've got to duck down

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
That's cute

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I would totally play this

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
He's got a little play cord thing

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
That's great

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
You know what though

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I'm a little worried

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Doesn't this seem like the type of thing that probably works way better

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
In the preview than it does in real life

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Like you're probably throwing this guy around

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And it's just like fucking move the way I want you to

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Yeah, but if they've got a kid doing it

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Well, come on

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
This is all cut and paste

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
He's not actually playing the game

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I want to actually see

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
A practical demo of this

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Interesting

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Although I will point out

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
That little stuffed animal has a hole in its mouth

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Time to penis, 15 seconds

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Just saying

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
It's a new peripheral

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
It has to be measured, no pun intended

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
That's true

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Speaking of

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Speaking of adorable and cute games

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Although this one I don't think Jamie plays quite as much

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Maybe she should though

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And if she wants to know where to begin

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
LittleBigPlanet has done the first annual

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
SAKI awards

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Or that they're calling them the Sakademy awards

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I think that's a really cute little pun there

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
The Sakademy awards

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Media Molecule has been giving out all these types of awards

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
Did you know there's 1.5 million LittleBigPlanet levels right now

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Holy crap

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
That's a lot

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Like stupid levels

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Probably 1.49 million

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Really bad levels

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
That's still a lot though if you have 100,000 good levels

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
That's true

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Some of the awards that they gave out

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Best Mashima video

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Best visuals and use of special effects

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Best use of story in a level

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
And all more

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
The best visuals one was pretty awesome

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It was a post-apocalyptic

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I think was the name of it

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
And it actually had really good lighting

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
And explosion effects in there which is pretty awesome

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I saw one where the Sakboy would step on a switch

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
And then this piano just started to play Beethoven

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
And it wasn't even one of those musical levels

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Where you hang on to the vehicle and it plays a song

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
As you run through the level

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
But no, an actual piano came down

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
And little feet would dance on the keys and play Beethoven

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I was like, good god this game is crazy

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
In a good way

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The things people do with it is insane

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
But here's

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Here's what LittleBigPlanet needs

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
One thing I think is missing right now

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Is that if you go in to play custom levels

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I think the interface right now for playing custom levels

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Is still a little eh

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
What they need to do is take these award winners

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
And put them on a separate planet or something

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Or put them in a separate menu

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Something where I can go straight to the best

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Where I can weed through all the crap that's out there

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And just go straight to these levels I have to see

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
I wonder if they had a category for best trophy whoring level

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Because remember when the game first came out

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
All the high rated levels were like

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Earn seven trophies in thirty seconds

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Exclamation exclamation one one one

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I was looking at some of the other ones on there

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Of course the Contra one

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
One for best collaboration which is awesome

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
All the Contra levels

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
As it should have

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
There was

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Best

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Logic device or something like that

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Or computer

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
And it was the LittleBigPlanet calculator

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
LittleBigPlanet calculator because that was really

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Really involved

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
There was

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I'm trying to think what some of the other ones were

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
There was like a best community project

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I didn't understand what that was

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I think it was just like tools

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
They had logic tools that you could use for your

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Your machines and stuff

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
But yeah definitely check out

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
The post apocalyptic level because that looked pretty

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Our good friend Bobby

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Is in chat and says

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
They might be in the news section Sky

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I forgot LittleBigPlanet had a news section but that's a good point

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Although I wonder if it will link directly to the levels

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I mean I'm sure it says something about the awards

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
In the news section but I wonder if it

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Would link directly to the levels I don't know

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
At the same time when I have been

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Playing LittleBigPlanet recently I've been checking out

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Those new Pirates of the Caribbean levels so

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I haven't had time to check out this academy winners

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
How'd you like those?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
It was cute I didn't play a whole lot

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
So I can't really give you a full review yet but

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I was kind of surprised that you

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Can't stay under water very long

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
There's a lot of things later that increase your breathing time

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
And things I haven't gotten to yet

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
You can get scuba gear that

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Allows you to breathe under water

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Forever

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So you can get that

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I figured that was there yeah

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I did like how the water can raise and lower

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
There was one part of the very first level

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Where you can flood the town

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
And then you bring the flood down

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
It was kind of neat

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I do

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I just love the fact that LittleBigPlanet

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Is still being supported

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
And that they haven't taken that route

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
That I think some developers would have and put all this

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
In LittleBigPlanet 2

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
They've really been supporting this one game

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
You know it's

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
A really good Playstation 3 value I gotta say

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I've colored me impressed

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
You know I named it my game of the year

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Last year and I still stand by it

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I think that's one of the greatest games

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
They've released in quite some time

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
But

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Maybe I'm just biased I don't know

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Anyhow moving on with more news and we'll get to release dates

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
DarkSakura what do you got for us?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I have some news about

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Sonic Racing

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
For 360

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Not Sonic R just to clarify

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
But there's actually going to be

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Characters that you can use

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
For Sonic Racing namely your avatars

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Will be playable and

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Banjo Kazooie

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
While I really don't give a crap about Banjo

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I actually think it would be pretty cool to go ahead

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
And use my

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
My avatar and the other

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Characters in the game too are

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Of course Sonic Tails, Shadow

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I from Super Monkey Ball

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Samba

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Samba de Amigo Monkey

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Beat from Jet Set Radio

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Alex Kidd, Billy Hatcher

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Whoa whoa whoa

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Sega is acknowledging Jet Set Radio?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Yes

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
That's good right?

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Alex Kidd

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh wow when was the last time we had an Alex Kidd game?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Billy Hatcher

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
And Ryo Hazuki

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
The guy from Shenmue

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Wow it's like Sega is like

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Throwing bones at all these like

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Fan like dammit we need

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
A new Jet Set Future, Jet Set Radio

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Dammit we need a new Shenmue and now they're like

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
They're teasing us with this silly little

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Racing game

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Well you remember when they teased us with having knights

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
In that stupid

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Eye Toy game

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Oh yeah knights in the game?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
But they said that there's

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Rumors though that other possibilities is

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Ulala and

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Akira from

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Virtua Fighter and Vice from Skies of Arcadia

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Now they're just being mean

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Like we all know there's not gonna be

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Another Space Channel 5 game so

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
There could be

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Space Channel 5

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I really wish there would be but like

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
They're just being mean by putting Ulala in the game

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Like that's just rude

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Space Michaels in the game

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
If they put Pudding Da in there

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I'm gonna scream

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Cause she was my favorite

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
She was my favorite

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
For me, sorry, it was Jaguar

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Cause we come with TAAAAA

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
With this little group

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Please please please if you've never heard of Space Channel 5

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
You really owe it to yourself to go look at the videos on YouTube

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Or try to find a copy if you can

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
On Dreamcast or Playstation 2

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
They had the collection

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Oh man I love that game

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I really wish they'd bring that back

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Because I cannot believe

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And I'm hanging my head in shame

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
As I'm even talking about this

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I bought stupid Barbie crap

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
For my avatar cause I'm ridiculous

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
But it was

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Why are you sighing at me Loki?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Don't judge me

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Stop judging me

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Why?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Why bother

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Buying stuff for your avatar?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Because it was really funny

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
It made me laugh cause it's in the band hero section

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
There's a microphone

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
And it has a giant purple ribbon

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Like the kind some 16 year old

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Girl would have

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
In her band

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I think it was the Taylor Swift microphone

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I bought that cause

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I liked karaoke and all that stuff

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It was really funny and it made me laugh

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
When my avatar was dancing with it

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
But then I was thinking

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
If I'm playing this racing game or whatever

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
You're not gonna see that microphone shoved in the back of the car

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Boo

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
It would be funny

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Remember that racing game that they had out

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
That was free to download and then they have all those

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Expansions you have to buy and stuff to it

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
On 360?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Well keep in mind I've been asleep for the past 5 months

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
On 360 so no

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Oh did it?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I think

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I don't know

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Honestly because

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
No I don't know if it came out because I would have downloaded it

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Cause it would have been free

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I don't know

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
How behind I am

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I just finally downloaded my

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Copy of

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Madballs

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Nice

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I've had the code for it forever

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Oh yeah I should probably download that

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Oh yeah well come on here I am on the show

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Going hey guys

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Shadow Complex wow what a great game

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Most people are like yeah didn't you get the memo like 6 months ago

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
So many games

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
So little time keep in mind

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
We all have day jobs

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Your game sites you like to go surf and all that

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
They get paid to play games 8 hours a day

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
And all that we don't do that

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
We have to work in our free time so

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Sometimes we can't play everything

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
And by the way chat there's a lot of folks in chat saying

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Like Misty says

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Barbie crap I bought a cell phone and I got the

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Free chocobo I waste enough money

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
On rock band download content

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Act Def said I would have expected Disney stuff

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
But Barbie come on Rob I wasn't being literal

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
It wasn't literally Barbie

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
But I call it that because

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I mean it's basically the same thing it's like a dress your Barbie doll

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
And there's no

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I did pay for avatar content

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Did I tell you? What'd you buy?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I got one of the steampunk outfits

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I actually have left over points

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Do you have one of those ginormous helmets or something?

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
No I got like the duster jacket with the

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Kinda gypsy top

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
But I'm actually planning on

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Getting the rest of the steampunk set

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Because I actually I don't really buy much with my points

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Dan usually puts all the points on his account

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
And buys this stuff for us

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
So I was gonna go ahead and get

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
The rest of the steampunk outfit because I think

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
The stuff's cute

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I have sim stuff what's the difference?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
One of the games I didn't mention

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
During my gaming week but I did play for a little while

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Was One vs. 100 and I was actually cracking up

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Because you know sometimes it'll show these random

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
People in the mob who get questions right

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Or wrong and like it cracks

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
My shit up when like I see this person wearing

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Just like a t-shirt and jeans but they

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Have one of those like uber robot helmets

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
On their avatar and it's like

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
That looks hideous like

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
And 45,000 people just saw how stupid your avatar looks like

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
And they couldn't be happier

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Then again I have a princess microphone

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
So who am I to judge?

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Who am I to judge?

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
At least you didn't buy a fake cat

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I didn't buy a fake cat

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Alright let's travel the world and look at some release dates

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
If there are any

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
This week actually there's some pretty decent stuff coming out

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
We have Darksiders from THQ

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Will be making its way out this week

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Also Fable 2 is getting a

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Platinum Hits version

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Coming out this week

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
With the download content of course

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
For 30 bucks

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Newer games though, Bayonetta finally making its way out

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
So definitely worth picking that one up

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Fast Food Panic on the Nintendo DS

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Making its way out

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
And

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Not really gaming related

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
But the Guinness Book of World Records

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Gamer's Edition

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Is making its way out to book stands as well

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
And you should at least

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Thump through it but I don't know if you should

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Pay them for it you know

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Unless your coffee table is empty and you need some

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Or honestly the top of your toilet

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Is needed some new material who knows

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Trust me for 15 bucks

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
You can find some better magazines for that

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Hell that's a few playboys or penthouses

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Geez

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
If you're looking for more toilet

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Stuff you know I'm seriously

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Better than the Guinness Book

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Do we really need to see

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh hey look Batman Arkham Asylum

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Was the greatest game ever

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Guinness says it must be true

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Or do you want to see some tits

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Or do you want to see some badge

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I just want to point out

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Some of our listeners are like 16, 17

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
If you realize this right

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Welcome to adulthood

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Don't you know you're supposed to say twat

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
And seriously

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
They know as well as I do

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
That the Guinness Book of World Records

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Gamer's Edition is crap okay

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I only looked at it one time

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
The 2009 or 2008

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Who cares they all suck

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Because I was killing time while my wife looked for books

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And I was just like

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Okay I've read this magazine read this magazine

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Hey Gamer's Edition let's see this is crap

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
That's it for releases

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Unfortunately

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
You only have those magazines for the articles

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Of course right

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Actually the articles are really boring

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Some of the forums are funny

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
But the articles suck

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Alright moving on

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Let's look at Japanese release dates

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
How we go from that to Japanese release dates

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I have no idea but we do

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
James Cameron's Avatar the game

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Gets it's Japanese localization

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
From Ubisoft this week

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
On the 7th of January

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
That's when the games are coming out

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That is also making it's way to the Playstation 3

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Just so you know

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Also I want to point out

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Speaking of Batman Arkham Asylum

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
That is finally making it's way to Japan next week

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
It will not be on the 7th

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
But it will be on the 14th

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So you'll probably hear me say it again next week

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
The Wii is empty this week

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
There's really not a lot to look forward to there

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
So is the Playstation 2

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
On the PSP

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
You got Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And I think that's pretty much your other

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Big big big game this week

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Did you see the trailer for that?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I have seen little bits and pieces

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
If you go to the website for it

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
The trailer is freaking amazing

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Then put it on the console

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
This is my biggest bitch about these

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Portable games

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Did you hear

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Earlier this week

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
On the DSI

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Like

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Old school Apple 2E or this new shit

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
This new shit

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Pass

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I'm like you don't have direction

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Keys on the

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
DS in order to

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Shoot

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I bet in these new games do you shoot

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Like 5 Buffalo and then like congratulations

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
You shot 3400 pounds of food

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Unfortunately you can only carry 100

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Back to the wagon

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I somehow doubt it

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I remember that

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Good times

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I was gonna say there's actually

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Another Oregon Trail game that I linked

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
In our show roll

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
You have to see it's Oregon Trail of Physics

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
It's awesome

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
The Oregon Trail of Physics?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
No, Oregon Trail with Physics

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
What is this? Did it not make the show roll tonight?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Then tell us about it

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It's this game, it's not even really called the Oregon Trail

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
But it is exactly the Oregon Trail

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
It's basically

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
The Oregon Trail

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
You stuff your cart full of crap

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Whatever you're carrying with you

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
And you take

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
It's like combining the Oregon Trail with

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
That sledding game

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I don't remember what it was

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
You like jump hills

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
You're oxed

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Just start running down the hill and then

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
You go off of it and fly and stuff

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And if you land upside down like people get injured

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Stuff like that

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I've seen a Flash game like that

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Somebody skinned that with the Oregon Trail basically

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Yeah, it's

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
What was it called here?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
It is

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Let's go find El Dorado

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
How do you die of dysentery in the game?

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Is that possible?

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
There's a video of it

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Is it a Flash game?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
It might be a Flash game

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I don't know

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm gonna look into this while Dark Sakura

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Covers the UK releases

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
You know, it's funny

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I was just saying

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
What was it called? The Road to El Dorado?

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I was just watching the Mysterious Cities of Gold last night

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So I thought that was funny

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Hello Random!

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It is Random!

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
It's on Hulu now, Rob

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
The Mysterious Cities of Gold

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
They have all this crazy stuff on Hulu

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Oh my god, look, he's showing me a picture

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Hahahahaha

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Let me see

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Oh, this is terrible radio

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I want to see if we have sound effects that I can play

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Geez

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Ok, well how about UK releases?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Which are, um, yeah, two

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
There's Bayonetta

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
And Darksiders

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And that's it

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Happy New Year!

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
No surprise, though, that it's pretty smart

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Bayonetta!

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Although, yeah, Bayonetta's a big, big release

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Can't believe they didn't try to crank that out in time for Christmas

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Especially because it did get its release over there

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
In Japan

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Maybe they're just hoping for big sales off of gift cards

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I don't know

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I don't know

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
What?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I know, I'm very excited about this game

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Oh, here's a little YouTube, let me see if this

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I don't know if this has sound effects or anything

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
But this is the Oregon Trail

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
It's like a little frog croaking or something

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
What the hell is that?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
It's upside down

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Did it just fart?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
People do get dysentery in that

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
This game looks amazing

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I guess it's more like Excite

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Excite, um, bike with

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
the Oregon Trail

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Somebody has typhoid right now

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It's like extra physics physics

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Where is this game available at?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I want it totally

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Ludum Dare dot com

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
L-U-D-U-M-D-A-R-E dot com

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
You should post that in chat, Rob

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I will do that right now

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Good!

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I'm excited that you're doing that, Rob

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Just while I'm posting that in chat

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Uh, Loki

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Okay

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Um, let's see

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I got so distracted by

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Oregon Trail-ish games

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Um, anyways

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So, some more fun stuff

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Uh, Google, they have

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Uh, patented

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Something that's actually

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Hinting to possible gaming

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Uh, coming to

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
YouTube, well

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I mean, I guess it kind of makes sense if you think about it

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Um, they

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Were saying that there's already

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Some kind of interactive games on

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
YouTube, uh, kind of done with

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Videos, sort of like your choose your own

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Adventure type stuff

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
But they were saying that the patent titled

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Web-based system for general

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
General, what was it, um

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Generation of interactive games based on

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Digital videos

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Um, was filed

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Earlier this year, or I guess last year

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And it was

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Um

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
They didn't really see what exactly it's

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Gonna be, but it sounds like

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Something that, um

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Links videos together, creating different

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Narratives and alternatives, and different scenarios

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
For the users, so

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So, Mark, you mark create your own video?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Something, probably something

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So that you can create your own, kind of choose

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Your own adventure stuff, although I wouldn't be

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Surprised if they did add like casual games

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
To YouTube or something like that

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Or you could just play like little flash games

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I mean, that would fit right in I would think

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I don't know

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
You know what this reminds me of is how on YouTube

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Like you sometimes see these YouTube things, it's like

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I want to say there's some channel

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Where it's like, play rock paper

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Scissors with me, and you click on the little

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Links to go to other YouTubes

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Like, you know, you pick whatever

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And then you see if you win or not

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Really stupid stuff, so they've patented

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That now? Apparently

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Weird, I wonder if they're planning on like

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Making a game out of it, or what

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
What they're gonna do

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
YouTube the game

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I don't know how I feel about that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I have to be honest, it's a little strange to me

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
But whatever

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Does it make you feel dirty inside, Rob?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
No, it just is weird

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I really don't have a lot else to add to it

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But that, it's just weird

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Alright, what's not as weird

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Because, you know, there's a lot of folks that are really

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Into classic games and respecting the classics

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And so forth

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
There is a project going on at the Atari Museum

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Where they're actually reconstructing

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
A lot of the old proprietary

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Chips, things from the 2600

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And the VCS, also known as

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The Atari 5200

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And Atari's old 8-bit computers

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
They're actually using data that was recovered

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
From old tapes

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Used in the original manufacturing

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
The Atari Museum's

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Kurt Vendell has noted that

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
The project has a practical application

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Besides just, you know, it being history

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
What's the potential of this?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Having the chips in smaller SMT packaging

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And potentially bringing back to life

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Some of the later CMOS designs of combo chips

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Which could lead to a

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
SOC, or system on a chip

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
The future just got a little brighter

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
In terms of preserving and continuing the legacy

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Of Atari's custom IC chips

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
But I kind of go, well

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I think of the flashback and stuff

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
But of course that's more of a console

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So they're talking about just the whole dang thing

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Right there on a chip

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yeah, I mean, it's like

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Those flashback consoles, like for example

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Though you'll see a lot of

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Nintendos on a chip

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I mean, it's probably not one chip

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But it's a few chips, but really shrunken down

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Like those little knock-off

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Nintendo systems and stuff

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That they sell at the mall

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
That Nintendo gets pissed at

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Or the flea market

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Tons and tons of those things

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Oh yeah, those are great for turning them into

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Little portable or arcade

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Systems and stuff

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But you know

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I'm all for, of course, the

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Preservation and stuff

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I really get a kick out of when they

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Have this, you know, they used to have it at E3 some time ago

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And even when I went to

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Classic Gaming Expo once a few years ago

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Just getting a look at all the old

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Shit, and just seeing how games

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Got to where they are now

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Or, you know, when you start to get in your 30s and all that stuff

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You start to go, I remember when that was out

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I remember when that was out, I remember playing that

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm sure it's

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Worse for others than it was for me

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But boy, going to one of those made me feel

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Very old

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
But I'm glad that that stuff

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Will be preserved and hopefully made more

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Portable to future generations

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Speaking of classics

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
We always like to take a moment to

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Pay some tribute to classic games

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
When Dark Soccer takes

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
A trip into the vault every week and pulls out

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
A game that she says, you know what, folks?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You should be playing this game

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Or you should check out this game, maybe you didn't know about it before

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
But it's our classic video game of the week

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
And it's preserved in our Orange Lounge Radio Museum

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Forever

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Forever and ever

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Which we call the Wiki

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
So Dark Soccer, what game are you lavishing

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Praise upon this week?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
First of all, the wrong link

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Let me actually find the right link again

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Uh oh

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah, because this isn't the link that I posted in the thing

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Might have just broke on its way or something

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So, don't know what to tell you there

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Okay, there we go

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Um, the game is

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Chōjiki yōsai

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Macross oboete imasu ka?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Which is, Macross, do you remember love?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Which, of course, we know there was

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
An anime movie

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And actually, let's listen to the music for a second

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
You know the music?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
That was the scrambled music

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
From the actual Macross movies

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Explosions!

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Sorry, speakers

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It's a shooter based off of the

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Macross anime

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And this one actually has to do

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
With sort of

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
According to

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The creator

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Kawamori Shōji

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
That this is not an

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Exact final word on what happened

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
With the crew

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Of the SDF-2 Megarode 1

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Which was the ship

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
That was taking everybody else

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
To, you know, discover what was

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
At the center of the galaxy

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Um, this is just

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Sort of like a dramatization

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
About what might have happened

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
But you basically

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It shows you, you know, leaving Earth

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And, you know, fighting, you know

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
A bunch of Zentradi everywhere

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And it was

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Actually a pretty, pretty cool

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Game, it's one of my favorites

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And they actually had

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
New dialogue recorded for

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
The game when it came out

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
By Mari Ijima

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Who was Min May's voice actor

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And yeah, Min May is still annoying

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
But, she's Min May

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But lots of, you know

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Shooting, you could lock on

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Different enemies

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
In foreground and everything

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It was pretty cool

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And it also came out on PlayStation

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And I actually have both copies

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Don't ask

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I came into them somehow or another

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
For cheap

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It really is, you know

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I'd say for any Macross fan

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It is the game you should have

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I've got actually a ton of

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Macross games, I've got

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Macross Plus game

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I have Macross M3 for Dreamcast

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
But of all of them I think

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
This one is probably my favorite

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Did I take the back? There's one on PC Engine

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That I really like, but this one is

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
The more easily accessible one that I like

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It's definitely

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
One that any

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Macross and shooter fan should have

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I mean, is that not just epic?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I'm not as familiar with the

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Anime series, but it certainly looks like a

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Heck of a shooter, but your

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Your plane is huge

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It takes up a pretty big chunk of the screen

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I'm kind of surprised there

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Between different modes

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
As you see it's in the

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
The full on robot mode, there's a

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Girl walk mode which is like a half way in between

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
This did come out of here as Robotech

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Gotcha

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It's pretty epic

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Pretty cool game

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Alright

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Well there it is folks, your classic

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Game of the week

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Macross Do You Remember Love?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
On the Saturday

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Check it out

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Oh you know Dark Soccer

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Loves her Saturn games

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And we're starting off 2010 no differently

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
We're going to take a quick break and when we come back

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
We'll have plenty more of Orange Launch Radio

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
We've got some quick news for you this week

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Including what's latest and greatest on the Virtual Console

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And iPhone games and Rock Band

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And we do have some other news

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
We're going to get into, including 8-bit

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
NES developments, yes, believe it or not

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And video games

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Meet obscure Winter Olympic Sports

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I kid you not

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And of course, Listless

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Tonight's topic for Listless

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And if you've never done Listless before, please please join us

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And chat because the chat room plays a big big role in this

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Tonight's topic, Thing I

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Most Want to Happen in Gaming

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
In 2010

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
This could get very interesting because as you know

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Sometimes we're serious and sometimes

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
We're not

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Let's get back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
We are live on this January

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The 3rd, 2010

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
That's right, our first show

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Of the new decade

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Well, okay, you could get into that whole argument that the decade

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Doesn't really begin until it's a one

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Because, you know, the first

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But we're going by VH1's rules, okay

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So just, you know, everybody else says the new decades

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
There you go

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Anyhow, whatever it is, it's the first show of the year

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And we're here to talk about gaming news

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Although it's been somewhat of a light news week

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Obviously, the holidays are still going on

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Lots of companies

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Either furloughed their workers

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Or forced PTO on their workers

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And I'm sure a lot of the game companies were no different

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
This week, and probably the publishing companies

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
That run a lot of the stories too

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And PR firms

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
All kind of taking the week off

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So I'm sure that's part of the reason why it's very quiet

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
But with a very full first quarter this year

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
In fact, more so than other years past

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That I can think of

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
News is going to pick up in the next few weeks

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So we'll stay on top of it the best we can

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Especially, I think, in a couple weeks

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
We've got CES

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Oh, that's true

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
There's sometimes a surprise or two

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I mean, CES is more of like the TVs

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And the home devices

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Well, it's technology, but hey, you know

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
There are some gaming things that come out of that

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Or you might see Aibo too

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I mean, I don't think we'll see Aibo too

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I don't think we will either

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Doesn't bow well

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Outlook not good

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
By the way, Listlist coming up later this hour as well

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Because, you know, somebody pointed out to me

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
You guys haven't done an OLR game in like a year

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And I'm like, you know, I don't think

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Since we moved to Studio Dark Sakura

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Have we done a single game

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And a lot of that is because we're in a tighter space

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Now than we used to be, so we don't have a lot of guests in here

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
That will be changing

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That hopefully will be changing as we get more guests

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And etc.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Alright

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Believe it or not, some things did happen

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
And we'll get into that

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And then we'll get into Twitter topics after the news

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Let those last few tweets come in on Twitter

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
So let's do rapid fire first

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Well, we talked about in part A

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
How we've missed a lot of games that have been coming out

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Well, I know for a fact

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
That I've missed a ton of stuff that's come out on

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Xbox Live Indie Games

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And here's a few games you may want to check out

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
First we've got

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Office Politics

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Which is the game you can have for the

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Large sum of 80 Microsoft Points

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Or $1

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And it's basically kind of an Office sim

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I guess

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Not really like

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I think Sony was pitching something like that

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Rat Race that was supposed to be like a comedy

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But this is very

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Sims-ish

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
You have to manage both like

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Your hunger

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And how tired you are and that kind of stuff

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
So you can take power naps

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And wonder where people are

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
How much you sneak on the internet?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Yep, all that fun stuff

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So check that out

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Ceiling Cat is watching you

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Available for $1, that's a great price

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
There's another game, Battle Beat

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's a

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Looks like almost a defense game

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Very similar to say

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Oh, I don't know

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Like a tower defense game?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Like the Crystal Bears?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Not so much like that

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
It gets a little bit like a tower defense game

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
A little bit like Plants vs. Zombies

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But you attack

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And play the game with

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Kind of like a beat

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
A little bit mixed with

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
A matching

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Music game or something like that

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So it's kind of neat, kind of fun

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
But since it's an indie game, don't expect any licenses

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It's all kind of original beats

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So it's pretty cool

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It's a strategy game

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So check that out, Battle Beat

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
That's also on Xbox Indie Games

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And then finally the best one

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
The funniest one I think

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Is Gerbil Physics

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And this is also on Xbox

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Oh god

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And it's these gerbils

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Like in little blocks and stuff

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And they make funny faces

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
When you stick bombs next to them

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Also a dollar

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
When you stick bombs next to them

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
You explode the gerbils

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yes, it's a little bit like Boom Block

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It's sad

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And it's just funny though

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Hold on, is that a YouTube you're looking at there?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Yes it is

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I know this is terrible radio

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Looking at YouTubes, but I need to see

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
What this is all about

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And maybe we'll hear some hideous noises

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Through on

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
So there's all these little gerbils

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Trapped in little blocks or something

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You put bombs by them

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
They'll show the bombs in just a sec

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I don't know really

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But look at how their eyes get all big

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And stuff like that

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
They look like gerbils trapped in blocks

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Like how Superman's parents were trapped in the big mirror

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
At the beginning

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It wasn't his parents

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It was the three in the negatives

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Whatever

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Whoever the hell they were at the beginning of Superman

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
You will kneel before Zod

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
The people

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Oh yeah, that's right

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Because they were the people that ended up being the villains in the second movie

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Whatever

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That's what these gerbils look like

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
They look like they're trapped in the magic mirror

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
That's funny

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So yes

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
You have gerbils and you're supposed to be

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I think knocking them below a line

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And it's cute

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And you don't really injure them

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But they get scared because they're being flung across the screen

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And you're detonating bombs next to them

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But hey, a dollar

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Once again, one dollar, twenty-four levels

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
So I mean, that's a great price

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Amaze Satsuma

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
In our chatroom at chat.org.com

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Thinks this might have been brought to us by PETA

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
People Exploding Tasty Animals

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
That was from the chat, not from me

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Views and opinions do not necessarily reflect

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You laughed, you're going to hell too

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I did laugh

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Other things not related to Xbox Indie Games

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Coming to the Wii

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And this is talking about a

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Blast from the past

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Fast Draw Showdown

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Looks like something that could be straight out of

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Mad Dog McCree

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And basically, kind of is

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
It's actually coming from Digital Leisure

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Which I believe did Mad Dog McCree

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Or at least published it at one time

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And they're kind of known for some of the

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
You know, full motion

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Video games

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
But this is like a Fast Draw game

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Using the Wii Remote as like your gun

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But you've got of course full motion video

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Of cheesy people dressed up like cowboys

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
From the 80's

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And uh

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Back when they made laserdisc games for the sake of

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Making laserdisc games and nothing more

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Pretty much, yeah

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Some of those games were pretty terrible

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
CD-ROM games, like remember when CD-ROMs

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Were new on the computer?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And they made some shittacious

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And I'm making up a new word there

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Shittacious games

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Just because you could have movies

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Although there were some

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Interesting ones in there too, like

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Return to Zork I think was one of those games

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I miss Mega Race, didn't it have Don Knots in it or something?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Fucking Don Knots

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I don't know, I think it did

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Didn't really play Mega Race

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
That was more your thing

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I think that game is on GameTap

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
But that's back when I was using GameTap

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
When it was cooler

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I can't say it's there now, I don't know

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It was one of those games that

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Really needed a two speed CD-ROM

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And I had an external

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Big ass

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Single speed CD-ROM disc drive

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So it ran kind of slow

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And then later on when I got a

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Newer computer and it had like a

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Was a 16 speed CD-ROM drive

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Which was like lightning fast

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It popped in there

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And the game ran too fast

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I would like to see

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The WiiWare emulate

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Speaking of Shittacious

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Remember the hologram games we had?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Oh yeah

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
There was a western one

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I think there was only two

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Hologram games

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I think there was a time traveling one

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
They had the first levels of western

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Maybe that's what I'm thinking, because I could never get past the first level

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Because those games controlled like butt

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Yes they did

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I would like to see that crap on WiiWare

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
For no other reason than it fits

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Well when we get to our holographic games

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I'm sure that'll be like some of the first levels of the game

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
When we get to the holodeck

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I'll be able to play that game all over again

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And then you can go fuck this shit

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And throw it across the room because it's virtual

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And you can do that

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
A hitstun in our chatroom

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
At chat.orangelessradio.com wants to point out

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Mega Race 1 and 2

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Are on GOG.com

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
They run in DOSBox

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Awesome

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I do think that they should make an indie game called

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Fuck This Shit where you throw controllers at things

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And that would be funny

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Especially if they're wiimotes

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Because Nintendo is really trying hard

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
To get away from that image of the

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Wiimotes going into televisions

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
That would be hilarious

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And this week on the

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Rockband music store

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I'm sorry, real quick, do you think that would get on to

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Xbox Live indie games, a game called Fuck This Shit?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Well you obviously would have to

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
You know, freak this stuff

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Frack this

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Shoot, frack this shoot

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I don't know

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Patent pending

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Rockband this week

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Of course we've talked about this for a few weeks now

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Different things coming

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Including the Paul McCartney download pack

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Which I saw commercials for this

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
They are actually advertising

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Download content on

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
VH1 and stuff

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I was like, what?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But it's Paul McCartney so I guess maybe that's why

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Well you know, it's kind of a big deal

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
When it's Paul McCartney

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Three songs, I mean, come on

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
But yeah, they've got a

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Live pack including Band on the Run, Jet

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And Sing the Changes

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Each of those available for two bucks

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
160 Microsoft Points

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Or 200 Wii Points

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
We really do need to do conversion for you

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
For that, and of course you save 50 cents

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
If you buy them in a pack

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Also coming in a three pack

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Blink 182 Pack 2

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Also available for $5.50 for a pack

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And $1.99 each

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
And they include Adam's Song, First 8

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And I Miss You

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And then finally the individual tracks also available

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
For two bucks each

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
We have the Psychedelic Furs with Love My Way

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And Sister Europe

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And the Ramones with Rock and Roll High School

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Which

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
That's pretty fun

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I got linked by Hitstun in the chat room

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
To an article that talks about Matt Hazard

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And those games, this is an article that was running on some of the gaming blogs this week

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I guess there is a

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Upcoming Xbox Live

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
And PSN title in the series

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Matt Hazard, Bloodbath, and beyond

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
One of the difficulty levels is called

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Fuck This Shit

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Is actually the difficulty level

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So somebody did

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Kind of think about it

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
The game isn't called Fuck This Shit

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It probably will be after you play it

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Fuck This Shit

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Why'd I pay for this?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Dammit

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Who knows, who knows

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Let's move on and talk about some other

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Quick news topics this week

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Loki brought up Plants vs. Zombies earlier

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And I know some rumors have come up before

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
About the game coming over to iPhone

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Well it does sound like it is happening

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
It's supposed to be coming to the iPhone

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And of course that means the iPod Touch as well

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
January is what they're saying

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
That's from PopCap's Facebook page

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
No word yet if

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Apple's approval process will

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Fuck all that shit up

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
DJ David

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And I always mispronounce his last name

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Guetta I think is how you say it

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
He had a download pack available in DJ Hero

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You can play some of the songs

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And the odd thing about it is that

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
It's some of the rare songs in the games

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
That aren't mixed with anything

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
They're remixes of those songs

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
They're not mashups

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
There's very very few songs in DJ Hero

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Like that but all those track packs

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I want to go back and play that

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I actually downloaded it and never played it

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Did you know the very last song in the game

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I don't think this is a spoiler

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The very very last thing you unlock

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Is Herbie Hancock's Rocket

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
With all that insane scratching

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Yeah

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
That's the last song that you get

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
And it is hell

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It isn't mixed with anything because the song

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Like when I first played it you know what I said

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Fuck this shit that's what I said

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
It's the one song in the game

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I can't get more than like two stars on

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
On hard

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Anyhow back to David Guetta

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Cause I liked his songs quite a bit that were in the download pack

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Well apparently he is actually working on

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
What he called the number two

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Version of the game

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I don't think he means the poop version

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I think he actually means DJ Hero 2

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Which you could read as some type of confirmation

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Of a DJ Hero 2

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Although I mean

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
File that next to Duh and of course

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But you know it is kind of cool

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
That he is involved with it

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Because you know a lot of DJs

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Very prevalent ones showed up in the first game

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
So it's kind of cool that they're working with a different handful

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Of folks for the second game

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I'd like to see what kind of mashups he might produce

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Cause he does some very dancy clubby type of stuff

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
So that would be kind of neat

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
To see what he puts together for

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
DJ Hero 2

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
One other quick note on a completely different note

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Ogre Battle 64

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I don't know if you remember this game

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
You might not cause I think it's one of those

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Really rare games that was out

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
On Nintendo 64

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It is apparently making its way to the virtual

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Console at some point in January

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Oh for Japan anyway

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But as you know

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Usually these games that come out in Japan

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Do make their way over here

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Some other things that are coming out on the Japanese

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Virtual console, Princess Tomato and

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Salad Kingdom remember that game on the Nintendo

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
That's coming out, Kirby's Star Stacker

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And Salamander and Parodius

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
For the MSX

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Cause remember they get

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
They get MSX over there

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Which we have yet to get

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Probably because those games aren't in English

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
At all

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
At all

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Although I really wish we would get the MSX games

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Cause you know what that means we could get is

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Guardic

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
That's right the game that the Guardian Legend was technically a sequel to

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Dark Stacker what do you got for us?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Some stuff

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
We actually have

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
A new

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Trademark from Sega

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Let's Go Island

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Which the theory

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Is that it might be a sequel to

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Let's Go Jungle

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Who knows but basically

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
The way that Let's Go Jungle was

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
You had guns

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And you shot your way through the jungle

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
It was

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Though it's a potential though that

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
This is going to be one for the Wii

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So it could be who knows

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Also

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Microsoft wants avatars

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
To reflect

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Actual physical characteristics

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
They've

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Put out a patent

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Application for

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Avatar individualized by

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Physical characteristics

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
So they want to

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Eliminate the artificial look

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And make it look like someone actually

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Really looks

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I'm not really sure

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
How they're going to pull that up

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But they're basically saying that

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
They want to have a bit more reality

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
In the game

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And actually be able to portray people

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Accurately

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And that

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
They're basically going to be pulling like

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Actual health data

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And you can spend points on it

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah there's some controversy behind this

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Because I seem to remember hearing somewhere

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
That this ties into

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Like

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Hey fatty stop playing the game basically

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Like that could be the next

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Development which would suck

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Because people should be able to do what they want

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Yeah

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Well there's now

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Well a pachinko game

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
That is

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Castlevania

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
It's Castlevania Pachislot

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And it has a story

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Where you are Trevor Belmont

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Challenging Dracula

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And being helped by Angela

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Who's a sorceress

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And it actually

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
You can buy the soundtrack to the game too

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
It's pretty

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Kinda

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
There's even a video of it

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That's funny

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Because you know there's a Gradius pachinko

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I'm kind of surprised

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
This is the first Castlevania

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Pachinko machine

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Well there's also a Parodius one too

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That I've actually

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Found a playthrough

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
About

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
This is pretty neat

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I would be surprised if this is the first

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Because keep in mind that Konami does slot machines

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Is a big business area

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It's actually got pretty cool graphics

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And I'm assuming it could be pachinko machines over in Japan

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Because we don't really see those here

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
But I have seen Konami slot machines here in the US

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
This is actually pretty hot

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Nice

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Why can't they actually do a good game like this?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
That's what I was thinking

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
That looks better than a lot of the games that have come out recently

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Like Judgment?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Yeah

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Let's go to the Twitter

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
You know Judgment would have been really good

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
On the Playstation 1

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Let's go to the Twitter

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And look at some Twitter topics tonight from you guys

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
The listeners, you guys have sent us a few things tonight

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Let's start it off with Blue Swim wants to know

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
What game or franchise do you think

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Will be each system's biggest selling title

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
In Holiday 2010

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
This is really hard, dude

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Because a lot of these games

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
We don't know about yet

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Because E3 is kind of when the Holiday lineups are announced

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So these are really shots in the dark

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I would say probably the biggest seller

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Out of any of them is gonna be

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I think Nintendo's gonna unveil the new Zelda

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
This year's E3 and that'll probably be the big one

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Because Wii's got the biggest market

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
You know, clutch right now

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Otherwise, if there's

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Some type of new Call of Duty game next year

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I'm sure that will take the crown too

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
No, because if it's the actual trend

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
It's gonna be not the Infinity Ward game

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
But it's gonna be the other one

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Forget the other company

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Not the Infinity Ward here

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Alright, fine

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
But I think Zelda will also be a big one

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I don't think it has to be necessarily

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
First party either

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I think when we bring up these third party activisions

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And so forth

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And it's kind of on multiple systems

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Because Modern Warfare was probably the biggest seller, right?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Yeah

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
This year, and that was on multiple systems

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Let's see

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Going to

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
VonToxic on Twitter says

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
If Tinker isn't on your news list

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
You should mention it

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
It's free on Games for Windows Live

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And it has achievements

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I don't know if VonToxic might have something to do with this game

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
But hey, I'm off for free

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And yeah, that's Windows' new games on demand thing

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
You know, kind of like their Steam competitor type thing

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Hey, Steam

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Do these achievement points

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Steam

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Kind of blend together with my achievement points on Xbox Live

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I doubt they do

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Because I don't think the PC like Halo 2 had them

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And I don't think they blended

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Well, Grand Theft Auto 4 does

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
They have achievements

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I'm not sure

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I know it shows up when I play Grand Theft Auto 4

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And it's kind of pathetic

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Because Grand Theft Auto 4 has no protections on it

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Well, it had minimal protections on it

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So you could cheat really easy

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And all of that stuff

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well, it looks kind of like a puzzle-y type of game

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
It uses this little kind of isometric

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It looks like

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Is this like some type of reincarnation of Devil's Dice?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Because I noticed it uses dice

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
In kind of an isometric playing field there

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So I don't know, I'll have to download this myself

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And check it out, I'm off for free

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But I like some of these achievement names

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Like SmackMySwitchUp

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Switch1, Switch2, Switch3, Profit

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
So whatever that means, that's 10 achievement points right there

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
It's got to be more than Devil's Dice

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Because I see dominoes, I see little targets

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
This is clearly some type of

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Like a little puzzle game

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Based off toys you would find in a kids room

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But that's Tinkr

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And I'm all for free

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
So I'll have to check that out for next week

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Let's see

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Tigerclaw sent us a list of

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Xbox Live games for mobile phones

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I guess that's something being looked at

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Let's see

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
He's linking us to an article from

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
MTV's multiplayer blog

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Saying that Microsoft wants to do more

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Between Xbox Live and Windows Mobile enabled devices

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Of course, anything to

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Nickel and dime at the iPhone

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And kind of get back at them for that

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Talking about avatars on the phones

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Being able to do Xbox Live

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Social media

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Multi-screen experiences

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
They're hiring what's called a principal program manager

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
That's going to drive the platform

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And bring Xbox Live enabled games

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
To Windows Mobile

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
You know when I hear this

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I kind of think about the whole

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Remember the Fable pub games

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
That tied into Fable 2

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I could see something like that happening with this

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You have a mobile game that kind of enhances

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
An existing game

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But doesn't necessarily take the place of it

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
If that makes sense

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Yeah

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And especially if they tie it into one of their big franchises

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I'm sure it could be quite the big thing

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Marin Marvel

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
A good friend of ours says

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Final Fantasy 4 the after years is a fun

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Bit of nostalgia

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
What other series would you play an after years game for?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Me?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Final Fantasy 6

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I don't know, anything else you'd like to see

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Like a retro sequel

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Episodic nostalgic

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Tickle your nostalgia bone type of game?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
For Final Fantasy

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Anything really, I mean Final Fantasy 4

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
She happened to name Final Fantasy 6

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
But I don't think, I think we can name anything

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I'd like to see a new jet

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I was thinking the same thing, Dark Soccer, Chrono Trigger

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
A good one

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Something in that same vein

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Ironically enough I don't know if it would be after years

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Because Chrono Trigger was all over the map

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But that would be awesome

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I would like to see a new jet moto game

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But that

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Okay

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It's old enough by now

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Yeah, but I was thinking more like a story

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Kind of base thing, but I guess anything works

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Story based game

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
You know, these role playing games

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That never really

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Got fully realized, you know

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Like an actual Xenogears sequel

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
A Xenos saga

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Eh, not so much

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Let's see

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Um

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I'm actually

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Reading our chat room here

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
On Pachinko machines

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I'm looking, kind of catching up on our chat room

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
chat.orensonstrategy.com

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Very interesting perspective from AkumaJP

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Because he lives over in Japan

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And kind of gives us some perspective

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I know we have a couple of folks that listen in Japan

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I think that's great

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
He says Pachinko in arcade is a different store here in Tokyo

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Pachinko is bad because it's gambling

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And Pachinko can look good because the developer cost is different

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And the limit for developers is different too

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
So Pachinko is mostly computers

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I didn't realize they separated that in Japan

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The Pachinkos and arcade machines

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Were kind of in different places

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I mean it makes sense

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
You don't have slot machines

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Next to Street Fighter 4

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Here in the states

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But at the same time

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
We have like things that are practically like

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Little kid gambling devices

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
But they give you tickets

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
They don't give you money, they give you tickets

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And that, I mean those have taken over arcades

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Sadly in the past 10 years

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
These arcades have kind of been dying out

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Bitters I call them

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
You know something like

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Hit the button when the wheel is in a certain spot

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And this one little sliver will give you

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The jackpot whereas the things around

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
It only give you like 4 tickets

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And then you trade your tickets in for crap prizes

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Like that's kind of what we have instead of Pachinko

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
So I don't know

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Let's see also

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
On the Twitter

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Dan Shadow asks, what do you think of Bayonetta's sexiness?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Is the one handed mode too much?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Is there really a one handed mode or is that a joke?

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
It's a one button mode

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Oh I see

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I don't think she's that sexy

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
In the game, it's more of just kicking ass

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
All the time and so it's so over the top

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I think she's very sassy

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
That she uses her hair as a weapon

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
That's sassy

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
It's the glasses Rob

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It's the glasses

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Trust me, why do you think I'm never getting rid of mine?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I see

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It's a trick

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
So kind of a show tip

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
From Spazinator

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Wanting to know that

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Hold on, it got cut off

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I gotta reload the Twitter here

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Live radio folks, sometimes things screw up

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Cause we got some late tweets

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And it threw everything off here

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Spazinator says, here's an idea for an unofficial game

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
While in a story

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Blurt out a random, odd

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And unrelated thing to say

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
To see if anyone is paying attention and notices

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
I know you three like tangents and randomness

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
So here's the chance to essentially make a game of it

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
As if this show doesn't get derailed enough

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Doesn't that kind of already happen?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Yeah, it's called the show

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I know, it's kind of what the show is based on

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I mean, I like where you're going with that

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
But that's kind of been the longest running game

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
On this show

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
So there you go

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Dr. Duar says, how about suggestions

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
For mobile games for smartphones

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Other than the iPhone, thanks

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
That's a tricky one for me to answer

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Because I have an iPhone, I know Dark Sakura has an iPhone

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
We're sheep

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Loki doesn't have an iPhone, but you don't really use a fancy phone, do you?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I hardly use my phone

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Yeah, your phone's never even on

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
It's on all the time, actually

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Is that new?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
No, it's been on forever now

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
It's like for months

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Oh, for months, it's not like you've done that

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
For years and years

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Because I remember I used to call it and you'd never be there

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
That's okay

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I mean, you actually use a home phone

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I don't even have a home phone, I only have my cell phone

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Anyhow, sadly because of that

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I would feel kind of ridiculous

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Giving you other game recommendations when I haven't played any of them

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I will have to turn to the chat

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
To help us answer that one

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Chat room, do you guys have any suggestions for Dr. Duar

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
About what games he should be playing

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
On a smartphone that's not an iPhone

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Because I would be curious about that

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Amiga777 in chat says, y'all got iPhones

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I demand an OLR app

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I would love that if I knew how to do it

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Owning an iPhone does not make you a programmer of an iPhone

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And I do want to point out there is an all games radio app

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So you can listen to this

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Usually on the drive over to the studio

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I listen to the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Through the all games iPhone app

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So that's the best we have right now

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
We do have the PSP app

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I will look into how to do an iPhone app

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
But at the same time

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I don't want to just duplicate the functionality of the all games app

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I mean, that's what it's there for

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
If I can think of something special

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
That only could be brought from an OLR app

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Then maybe, but

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Don't really see the point otherwise

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
But maybe you guys have some suggestions

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I'm looking in chat

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I see Ionotropic says

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Kuglom for Blackberry

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Is the game that's being recommended there

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
So

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Some late tweets that came in

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I almost didn't read these

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
But since they came in here, why not

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Did you know that you can unlock a next gen

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Filter in Uncharted 2

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
It just makes everything browner

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
What?

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
I hadn't heard of that

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Is that just like for a look?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It's a joke, probably saying

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Because their game is so colorful and vibrant

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
And all the other games are kind of brown and murky

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I see, I get it now

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Let's see, Ray Iannami says

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
8 on the breaks DJ Max Technica machine

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Now has the Platinum Crew online service

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
That's a machine I haven't touched in a while

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I haven't really been to Roseville Golf Land in a while

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I remember they had one of those machines

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I don't even know if they still do

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
That's pretty broken by now

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I guess there's some new songs

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And some stuff that was unlocked there

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Kind of cool that there's still some arcades in America

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
At least somewhere, even if you have to go all the way to New Jersey to play them

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
That will do those cool little

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Unlocks and online things

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So apparently there was a huge line there

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Let's check that out

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Move back into some gaming news

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Listless coming right up

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
We have just a few more stories for you guys before we get there

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Yes

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Including, and this is kind of neat

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
A brand new

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Nintendo game

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Now, I use the term new

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Kind of

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I don't know

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Because this game

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Looks exactly like Mega Man

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
In fact, I would take a wild guess and say it's probably a ROM hack

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Of Mega Man

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
But hey, whatever

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
It's called Metal Kid Fortress of Peril

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
It plays very similar to Mega Man

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
It has the Mega Man type levels

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Mega Man type gameplay, including the Mega Man type

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Disappearing and reappearing blocks

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Mega Man type boss battles

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And some of the other things

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Though, you do have an inventory system

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Where you can add different abilities

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Including a double jump, a floating feature

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Different power-ups and whatnot

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
But what's kind of cool about it though

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Is it's actually getting a cartridge release

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
As well

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And there is a demo you can check out

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
That's available

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I believe on the website

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Retro Zone

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
You can play the demo

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Of course, in your favorite

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Nintendo emulator

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
But Retro Zone, of course, if you haven't

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Looked at their website

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
In a while, they have wonderful things

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Including reproductions of different games

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Including the Nintendo World Championships

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Cartridge, the Nintendo

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
College Tour

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Cards, they even have

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Ultimate Frogger, some homebrew

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Glider game, and one

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
That didn't really make our show roll

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
But because it's a little late

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
An 8-bit X-mas cartridge

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Which has a little light show that actually plays

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
In there as well

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I heard about that, that's trippy

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
That's kind of a neat little Christmas decoration

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Yeah, so it's kind of neat

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And the game itself

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I'm not sure how much it's being offered

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
My guess is it's going to be probably around $40

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Which is a little expensive

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
But hey, you get a cartridge out of it

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Personally

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I don't know, it looks pretty hard

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
So that might be

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Beneficial for

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
If you're looking for that, I guess

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I don't know

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
It's neat

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
It's cool that there's a lot of love still

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
For the old school 8-bit games and so forth

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
But a ROM hack

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
That's a pretty bold accusation

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
You watch the video for it

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I'll play you the video

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
The music's unique

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
But dude, you look at it

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
It's totally wrong

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Fast forward a little ways here in the video

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
We have a lot of video tonight

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Which is not smart for a radio show

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
It does look very Mega Man-y

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Those are the boss battles

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
It's different enough

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
If it's a hack, it's a damn good one

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I mean, maybe they...

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
But this inventory thing, that wouldn't have been in a Mega Man game

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Well, you technically did have a kind of inventory

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Yeah, but I don't know

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I don't see this as much of a hack

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Just as maybe Mega Man was an inspiration

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And maybe even some of the

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Stuff comes from it

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But I don't know if I'd call it a ROM hack

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
It looks like a ROM hack

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I guess there's only one way to tell

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
There's some really good ROM hacks out there

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It looks cool

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
There's a ROM hack of Super Mario Brothers

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
The first one that actually looks completely different

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And has a lot of new features added into it

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So...

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
It's very possible that this is just a ROM hack

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I wouldn't be surprised

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Sorry, the chat wanted the video there

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
So I'm linking that right there

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I was having a side conversation with chat

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And this just popped in my memory

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Because SSJ100Matt said something about PAX East

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I did just want to throw that out there

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I'm just waiting to make sure I can go to PAX's media

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
But I am planning on going

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I have a couple friends who are actually going from this area

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Seg, who's been on the show before

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I know he's going out there

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And both of us have a friend in common

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
In fact, the friend that introduced us

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Amanda, is planning on going

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So I'm going to PAX East with a girl

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Yay, I'm going to have a date

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
So I am looking at making that happening

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Sorry, cross the t's and dot the i's

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Don't dot the t's or I won't be going

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But as soon as I have all the details on that

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I'll let you know, but I did promise I would try to make that work

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And it looks like it's going to happen, yay

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
So

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Also, in news, other news

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Talking about ROM hacks

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Of sorts

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
These are fan translations

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
That I guess are at various

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Types of stages right now

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Fatal Frame 4

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
This is a game that was not released over here

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
They're doing a fan translation of it right now

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
And they're talking about doing voiceovers with it

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Apparently there's a fan translation that

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Has translated 99% of the text

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And they're going to do a patch soon

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So that you can play the game, but apparently now

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
They're not done, they want to start on voiceovers for the game

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Of course

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
It's going to be by fans, so don't expect it to be

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
A plus caliber stuff, but I don't know

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
It might not be the half bad either

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
So

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I think that'll be fun to do some voiceovers in games

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Sometimes though, some of them

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Do a better job though

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Than the pros

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yeah, that's true, that's true

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Front Mission 5 is also doing a fan translation

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And guess what, it's done

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Front Mission was the

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
2005, there was the fifth game

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
That came out on the Playstation 2

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
And apparently

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
The Front Mission series translation project

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Has taken this long

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Thousands of hours, 2000 pages of dialogue

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
To make this game

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
And it is already available

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And there's even a movie floating around on YouTube

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Where you can actually check it out and it's been subtitled

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
By the group and everything, that is freaking dedication

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
You know, I remember

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Many, many years ago when I was in college

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I think the very, very first

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Major fan translation project

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
That saw fruition was Final Fantasy V

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I remember when that came out

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
That was a big freaking deal because it was like

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Wow, somebody has

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Done what, you know

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Square refused to do

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I remember Seiken 3, also Seiken Densetsu 3

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
That was probably the next big, big one that came out

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I mean there were some little games in there that didn't have a lot of text

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
But yeah, then Seiken Densetsu 3 was a huge one

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
They came out after that

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
They even went so far as to

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Translating sprites in the game

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
It's very interesting how far that's come though

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Because you know, those are all cartridge based things

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Where you hack sprites and you change

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
You know, some of the coding to change

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
The kanji letters and the American letters and so forth

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Very interesting how far that's come

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
You're talking about a Playstation 2 game, that's videos and shit

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That's hardcore

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
No wonder it took so long to do it

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
That is a labor of love

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
No, I agree

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Something that the company should have just paid some people to do

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But I guess they didn't want to

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
One more story from Jamie, then Listless

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Right, in other news

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
This is for our fans of Dragon Quest

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
There is a slime curling game

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Ooh

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Basically, it's

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Going to be out on Nintendo DS

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And it's basically kind of like slime bowling

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
You know

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Because it's got

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Where you sort of guide it through different

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
You know, paths and try to land in the right place

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
And then you've got like a bowling mode

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
It looks like

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
It's just interesting

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
And what a timely release too

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Because we have the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics coming up

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Well yeah, this

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Looks like it might have been influenced

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I know you're all going to be glued to the tubes

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
To watch curling

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Exciting stuff

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
That's funny

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
No, actually, as much crap as I give curling

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
It's actually kind of interesting

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Maybe I'm just weird

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
But it's kind of neat to watch

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Because sometimes those WTF sports

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Are kind of

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I don't know, they make for good watching

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I'll shut up now

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Do you think you'd play that game though, the DSi game?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
No

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Fine

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Dark Tetsuya

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
In our chatroom at chat.orangetonshooter.com

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Says the OLR game could be about curling

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Yeah, Dark Star

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Could have the broom

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Why not?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Curler hater

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
That's what you are, you're a curler hater

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I don't need curlers, I come with enough on my head

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
We are going to

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Get our friend Bobby Blackwolf

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
On the program right now

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Because he's going to help us with a little game tonight

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So we're going to call our good buddy Bobby

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Hopefully he's standing by

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
We're going to ring him up

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
He's the man who hosts the show before

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Here on All Games Radio

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
The Bobby Blackwolf Show is live at 5 o'clock Pacific

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
8 o'clock Eastern

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
On Sunday nights right here at All Games Radio

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Bobby, are you there?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I am, how are you guys doing?

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Good, how are you Bobby?

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I'm doing good

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I didn't listen to your show before

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Something they ought to know is that

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
You always have us on your show every week

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
You kind of do what you call the Daily Show

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Tease, right?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Yeah, exactly

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Where we get to do our little

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
What's Coming Up on the Colbert Rapport

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Segment at the end of the Daily Show

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
It's kind of like a toss over there

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
You're always really good to us having us

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
On the show every week, but unfortunately

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
It doesn't really get to work in the reverse

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Because nobody comes on after us on All Games Radio

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
We rarely get to have you on

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
We do read your comments from chat and so forth

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
But we're glad to have you here with us tonight

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
To help us with the very first list list

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Of the new decade

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's very exciting

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Now Bobby, for those that have never heard your show before

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Since you always let us talk about

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
What's Coming Up on Orange Lounge Radio and so forth

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Tell us a little bit about the Bobby Blackwolf Show

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
In case our listeners have not tuned in yet

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
It's me rambling

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
That's all you need to know

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
You do a really good job selling your show

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
No, it's basically

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I go through some issues

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Or things that are going on

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It's me talking

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And reading chatroom comments for the first

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
20-25 minutes and then I try to take phone calls

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
From people for the last 25 minutes

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And then I get to talk to you guys

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
It's basically my take

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
On things that I want to talk about

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
In the games I'm interested in

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
People like listening to it

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
So that's why I keep on doing it

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And you do this show yourself

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
The Bobby Blackwolf Show

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So you don't have anybody to really banter with

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
But your listeners

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And that's a tough job

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I don't think people realize how difficult that is

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
That means you have to read chat

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
As you're trying to talk sometimes

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
That's tricky

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Well, no, it's I let dead air happen

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And then I edit that out of the podcast

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Whenever I put them up

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
We don't have to tell them the secret

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
But your show is getting some love

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
There in our chatroom from Kitsune

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Yes, Bobby does a very good show

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
If you get sick of the dick and fart jokes

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
On our show, Bobby's a lot more serious

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I should point that out

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Bobby keeps it family friendly on his show

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And why would you be getting sick of the dick and fart jokes

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Is what I gotta say

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I'm saving them for you guys

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I have no problem with them

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I choose not to

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
For that hour

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
That's just fine

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
If you want the suitable for broadcast

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Video game podcast

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
There's tons and tons of shows

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
On the All Games Network

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
And it's growing exponentially

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
So check it out at allgames.com

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Anyhow, you ready to play Listless tonight?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I am

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Alright, let's do the music

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Oh, it's been forever since we've had the music

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
For Listless

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Since it's been forever, I'm gonna explain real quick

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
How Listless works

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
We're gonna put out a topic

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And then the four of us panelists tonight

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and Bobby Blackwolf

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Are top three

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
So four times three means we'll have a list of twelve

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Then comes the tricky part

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
We all go around the room

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And we eliminate one thing from the list

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
That takes us down to a list of eight

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Which our chat room will vote on

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000
To come up with the definitive list

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
To answer this topic

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And tonight's topic is

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.000
The thing I most want to happen in gaming

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
In 2010

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
This can be serious, this can be silly

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
This can be lol worthy, this can be

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Nobel prize worthy

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Whatever you want to do

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
It's up to you

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
What you guys think our listeners would want represented

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Is the thing most wanted in gaming

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
In 2010

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
So Bobby, my friend, I'm gonna let you start

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
You're the guest tonight, we'll let you go first

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
What would be your number three thing

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
You most want to happen in 2010?

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Number three thing, this is my serious answer

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
And you guys actually did a story on fan translations earlier

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
But I want to see Mother 3 localized and released here

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Legitimately

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Mother 3 localized and released legitimately

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
That's a damn good pick

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
That's a hell of a way to start off

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I think that's something folks have been looking for for a long time

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
So very good

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
By the way, make sure you are in our chat room

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Because it is the chatters that ultimately take that list of eight

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
And break it down to a list of the top three

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
What a way to start us off

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
A very serious answer there

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
So, Loki, we'll go to you next

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
What would be your number three pick?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I don't even know if this would be good

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
But I'm just gonna say it

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I guess

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Branthuff Auto 5

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
For Project Intel

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I don't even know if that would

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And is that just like

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I don't even know if I want to do that

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Is that just the fanboy for Grand Theft Auto

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
And you mixed with the

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
You just really want to be able to slap a hoe for real

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Is that what it is?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
You know, that might not be good at all

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I'm just thinking about that now

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
That might be horrible

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Do you want to quickly change it?

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I want to quickly change that

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Let's find something more appropriate

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
For Project Intel here

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I think it'd be funny to see that

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Milo kid become like

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
The actual child sim

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
In Project Intel

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Because it'd be funny to torture that kid

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
So, Milo becomes sim baby?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Or what am I calling this?

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Sim child

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I'm so hungry

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Tough, you're not real

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Starve

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Okay, Milo becomes sim child on Intel

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Okay

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Loki, did you do your homework before tonight's show?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Or are you just doing it in class?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Alright

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Dark Sakura, what is your number 3 pick?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
A real Silent Hill game

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Ah, so you're

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
None of this homecoming garbage, huh?

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
No, and even Shattered Memories isn't really

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Silent Hill, it's more like

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I don't want to spoil it

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I see, okay so a real

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Silent Hill game says Dark Sakura

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Alright, my number 3 pick

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Is, funny enough, extremely

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Similar to what Dark Sakura picked

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
But very different

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
My number 3 pick is also a serious pick

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I want Akira Yamaoka

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Now that he's left Konami

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I want him to start a development studio

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And announce a new survivor horror franchise

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I mean, because obviously he can't do Silent Hill

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
If Konami still has that

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
But I would like to see Akira Yamaoka

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Start a development studio

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
And announce a new survival horror franchise

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Um, Loki, is that a game you'd like to see happen?

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Or what?

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Um

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I don't know

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Maybe with the creepy bunny

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
We need more games with the creepy bunny

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Fine, more games with the creepy bunny

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Alright, uh, Bobby

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
We now have set our number 3 picks

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
We're up to number 2, so what would you like to see?

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Your number 2 thing you most want to see happen in gaming this year

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I want to see this

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And I know everybody out there

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Will agree

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Eye of Judgment finally sells

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
1 million units

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
They'd have to actually start manufacturing them again

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
But, hey, he can do anything he wants

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Alright

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Maybe they will have a new game this year

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Or something

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Where the interest in the old game

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Just comes back

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Like Valkyria Chronicles

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Took like 6 months to catch on

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
So maybe this is like that

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Where

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It takes 6 years to catch on

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It's fine

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
If it goes into best hits, Loki

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Those best hits copies are going to count

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Because it's still the same game

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
So Eye of Judgment is very true

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Alright, so we got something

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
It's never going to happen because it has to sell a million copies

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Well, Loki

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
It's what I want, that's what it's about

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
That's right, it's what we all want, dammit

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
You better get your wife starting on that

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Tingle outfit, that's all I'm saying

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
He isn't so

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Loki, fine then, what do you want as your number 2

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Thing you most want to see happen this year?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
President Cat

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
For Wii

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Amen to that, President Cat localization

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Finally announced for the Wii

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
That's something we've been bitching about for months and months

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Bobby, you weren't even here when that happened

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Think of the merchandise

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I mean, the merchandising alone

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
You'd make a killing

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I hope, I hope by some act of

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I don't know what

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Seriously, think about it

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Look at like, um, like Invader Zim

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Off TV, but they sell merchandise

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Out the ass, it's just like

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Crazy

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Can I just point this out, I hope by some act of

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I don't know what, we get invited

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
In Nintendo's press conference at E3 this year

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And somehow through another act of

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I don't know what, lol, haha

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
That is actually announced by Reggie

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
On stage, listen carefully

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
For the cackling from the audience

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Because it'll be me

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Losing my shit

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
In the audience, just so you know

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Okay, Dark Sakura

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
If we got invited by Nintendo

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
To present President Cat coming to America

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
On stage with Reggie

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I would be there with a Tingle costume on

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
It would never happen

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Hold on, stop the music, stop it

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Stop it right now

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Did I just hear you correctly?

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Yes, because it will never happen

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
There is a back door to winning the Tingle bet

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Apparently, I know, I'm happy about this

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I know, I'm just, there is a back door now

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
If we get invited by Nintendo

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
To announce President Cat on stage

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Loki will do it in a Tingle costume

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
What that has to do with President Cat

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I don't fucking know

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
But this now has to happen

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
It will never happen

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
They used GPD for some of their other stuff

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
At previous press conferences

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
It could happen

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I will shave my head and tan a lot

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And I'll look like GPD

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
If that's what it takes

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Okay, back to the music

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Dark Sakura, your number two pick for me

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Trauma, Trauma

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Oh, okay, so by proxy

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
That's okay, it's your list, do what you want with it

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Keytar Hero

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
With a Q?

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
No, it's

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
The keytar

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
The keyboard

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Oh, okay, got it, got it

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Yeah

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
And who would be the featured artist in Keytar Hero?

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Elton John

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Alright, fine, Keytar Hero

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Alright

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
That's the number two thing

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I would like to see happen

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Actually, funny enough, it has to do with Nintendo at E3

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
The number two thing I would like to see happen this year

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Is I want Reggie to apologize

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
At E3

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And then for effect, punch a kid in the face

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Yes

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Just to show that they are not about

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
The kids anymore

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Reggie's gonna come out on stage and say, I am sorry

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
That we've lost our focus

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
And then to prove it, he's gonna punch

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
A kid in the face

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
That's the number two thing I want to see happen this year

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Wouldn't you like to see that happen, Loki?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Sure

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I guess

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
What a weird

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
The face!

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Yes, and actually

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I'm not gonna put this on the list

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
But Loki could punch the child

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
In his tingle outfit

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Hey, I would be down with it

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I know you would be

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Alright

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
So, so far, just to let you know

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Where we're at in case you're just joining us

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
The list so far, thing we most want to see in 2010

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Mother 3 localized and released

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Milo becomes sim child on Natal

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
A real Silent Hill game

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Akira Yamaoka starts his studio

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Does a new horror game

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Eye of Judgment sells one million copies

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
President Kat for the Wii

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Keytar Hero

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
And Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Alright, so now this is it

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
The number one thing you want to see happen

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
In gaming this year

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Bobby, what is it? Number one

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Game companies everywhere

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Realize that first person shooters

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Are oversaturating the market

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And begin to turn all those franchises

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Into dating sims

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I approve

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
That's a good one

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I'm gonna have to shorten that

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
So I'm gonna put first person shooters

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Turned into dating sims

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
But you all know what Bobby means

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
What would be at the top of your list

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
For that?

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Well, some about the

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Pink Spartan in Halo

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Romancing her

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I see, okay, so first person shooters

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Turned into dating sims, I like that

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Alright, number one answer

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Loki, what would be your number one answer?

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I don't really have anything

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
That I could go with

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I guess

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I didn't do my homework

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
They do yell things in chat

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
But I'm not reading chat

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Holodeck

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
No, that's never gonna happen

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Gaming gets closer and closer to the holodeck

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
But it's like the limit

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
You get close to one, but you never reach

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
One, that's what it is

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Yeah, okay

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Let's see, something I wish

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Would happen

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I hope

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Sony has another press conference

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
That sparks a bunch of

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Wonderful memes again

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Like Ridge Racer, in fact, I hope they have

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
A giant enemy crab come out on stage

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
To announce a game for Sony

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
You know, the beat in on the joke

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Or their next concert will be shaped like a giant enemy crab

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
That'd be funny

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Okay, since you need to pick one thing, I'm gonna say

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Like actually comes out on stage and presents something

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
In a tuxedo

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I'm not writing that

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
But you'll just know it's there, fine

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Alright, Dark Sakura

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
It's your turn

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
What's the Uno thing you most want to happen in gaming

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
In 2010?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Half Life 2 Episode 3

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
With the portal gun

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
About fucking time, huh

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Well, it's supposed to come out anyway

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
But I want the portal gun in it

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Alright, a somewhat serious one

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Folks have been looking for this for a long time

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Half Life 2 and Episode 3

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Dude, they're gonna have the Borealis in it

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Which is the Aperture ship

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Where's my portal gun?

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
They should just have a mashup game

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
With the different Valve franchises together

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Like you hit the portal gun with zombies

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
And you know, the Team Fortress 2 guys

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Garry's Mod

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
That'd be awesome

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
But if Bobby's thing stays too

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Then Half Life 2 will become a dating sim

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
So I'm not sure, with the portal gun

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So I'm not sure how that's gonna work

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
But it's gonna be funny

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
This date sucks

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Quick exit

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I like where this is going

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Be going

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Okay, my number one thing

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I have somewhat a controversial answer

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
But man, I would just

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
This would just make me so happy

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Like, I would just

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I would cry tears of joy

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Would you pee with happiness?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Maybe, but you know, in the toilet

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Cause that's dirty otherwise

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I would just be so happy if this would actually happen

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
The number one thing I would most like to see happen

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
In gaming in 2010

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Is X-Play gets cancelled

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Thank you very much

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
That would be sweet

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Not that bad

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I was gonna say that G4 gets cancelled altogether

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And replaced with a Seacrest network

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
But I'm just-

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
I have to feel sorry for X-Play

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Because they were part of Tech TV at one time

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And so I hate to see the last bit of good

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
You know, Tech TV

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Die off

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
But

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
I just have to admit

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I'm just done with the reviews

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I'd like to see him return to

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Say a out of ten

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Scale instead of out of five

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I give Sky's answer

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Three out of five

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Very nice

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Bobby, I've copy pasted the list for you there

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Now is the hard part

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
This is the part where we're gonna go around and eliminate things from the list

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
No hard feelings everyone

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
This is just a part of the process

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Okay, so let me again recap

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
The twelve items on our list

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
That the chatters will soon vote on

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
As we reduce this to eight

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Mother 3 localized and released

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Milo becomes Sim Child on Atoll

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
A real Silent Hill game

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Akira Yomoka starts the studio and does a new horror game

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Eye of Judgment sells one million copies

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
President Kat on the Wii

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Ki-tar Hero

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
First person shooters turn into dating sims

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
And X-Play gets cancelled

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Bobby, unfortunately it's part of the game

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
One of these has to go

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Just because I'm not into those games

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
The Silent Hill thing's gotta go

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
The real Silent Hill game?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Yep

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Alright, so sadly Bobby has said

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Nah, I'm done with Silent Hill

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
A real Silent Hill game has been eliminated from the list

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Alright

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
The Eye of Judgment sells a million copies

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
It's never gonna happen

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Ever

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Get over it already?

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Ah, sorry Bobby

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
You know what, for what it's worth Bobby

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I really like that answer, that was good

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Alright, but unfortunately Loki has deemed it unworthy of the list

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
And therefore it is gone

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Dark Sakura, which of these

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Is not worthy of the list?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
First person shooters turn into dating sims

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Oh

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Why don't we bring Bobby on the show

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
If we're just gonna eliminate all his answers

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Because

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Dating sims are

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
All you have to do is just go to Japan

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Everything's a dating sim

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Poor Bobby, I'm sorry Bobby

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
For what it's worth Bobby, I'm gonna leave your last one on there

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Cause I liked it

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
The one I am gonna eliminate though

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
The one that I think is not worthy of the list

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Milo becomes sim child on Natal

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Because I don't even think Loki knew what that answer was

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
So that's the one I'm eliminating from the list

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Just a way to torture

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
That virtual kid

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Which actually if I think about it

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I'm sure they're included in some sort of

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Fable game and I'll do just the same

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
In that, so

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Alright, here it is

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
The eight that the chat room does get to vote on

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Remember chatters, when you vote

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Damn, I should have said Peter Molyneaux jumps into a volcano

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
That would have been better

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
See, I wouldn't have eliminated that

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Alright, here it is though, these are the list

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
As it stands

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Mother 3 localized and released

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Akira Yamaoka starts a studio

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
And does a new horror game

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
President Kat is on the Wii

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Ki-tar hero

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Half Life 2 Episode 3

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Is finally released with a portal gun

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And X-Play gets cancelled

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
To vote, send a private message to Sky

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
With your number one

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And your number two answer

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
If you don't label what's one and two

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I'm going to just assume the first one

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Is your number one choice

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
So place your vote now

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And we will tell you what the top two

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Sorry, top three were

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
A little later in the show

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And no, Bobby, stop telling the chatters

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
To add Dating Sims

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
That's just the way the game works

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
It's no longer on the list

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
But nothing

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Bobby, thank you so much though

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
For playing the list tonight

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I think the Mother 3 one especially

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Was a good one that I completely forgot about

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I am behind that too

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Isn't it funny your serious answer

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Was the one that gets through

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Bobby, any other quick plugs for what's going on

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
In your life, you do another show

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
On Friday nights, tell us about that real quick

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Before I let you go

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
It's called Friday Night Gaming, it's an actual video show

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
In the sense that we actually

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Have three cameras, we do it from

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
An independent game store

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Here in the Atlanta area and we basically

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Play a game

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
We live on the air, we stream it out

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Sometimes we'll even play it online

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I think this week we're going to be doing Bayonetta

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
As our welcome back in 2010

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
It's an audio podcast

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
But it doesn't really work as well

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Because it's very video heavy

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
But we do it over on Ustream for three hours on Friday nights

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Fnglive.net

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
We also take phone calls

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
We have the chat room

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
It's basically an extension of what I do on Sundays

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
But a little bit more free form

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
And there are dick and fart jokes in it

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
On a Friday night, so very good

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And you get a whole weekend because then on Saturday night

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
They do a lot of dick and fart jokes too

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
So you can get it all through your weekend

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Excellent

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Well, Bobby, thank you so much for joining us tonight

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Best of luck with your shows

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
And we'll let you know what happens with the list

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Alright, thank you

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Dating sims for everyone

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Alright, take care Bobby

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Maybe in 2011

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Alright, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Who hosts his own show

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Right before us here on

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
All Games Radio

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
That's about going to take us to calls

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And so forth, but not until

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
We do a very important

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Segment of our show while I tally up

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
The listless votes

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
It's the part of the show where you guys

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Send us emails and we pick a few

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Of our favorites and read them for you guys

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
It's the mailbag segment

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Dark Sakura

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
What kind of emails do we have this week?

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Just one

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
One good one I hope

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Well, we shall see if it's good

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Just going to take me a moment to get it

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Pulled up

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
That's all

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
It is

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I'll just start from the beginning

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Dear gamers and OLR crew

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I'm not going to read the beginning of this

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
You were right about the 360

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
It is gaming heaven

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I've never been this immersed in a game

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Since Pokemon Gold on a 15 hour

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Road trip with constant grinding

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Level 100

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
The three days before I went to the store

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I was constantly switching games on my PSP

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Since I decided to kick the Wii out of the

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Gaming cave

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I was switching between GTA and Rainbow Six Vegas

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
And Final Fantasy 6

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I finally went to the store

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
A local chain called Gamers

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
To get the used Xbox 360 Pro

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
With a 20 GB hard drive

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I knew what I was jumping into

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
With the problems the system had

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
So I got a 2 year extended warranty

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
In the name of being the MLG

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Like Tom T-Squared Taylor

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Whatever

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I picked up Halo 3

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
In the interest of getting some

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Headbanging done

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
While whaling on my plastic axe

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I got Guitar Hero Metallica

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
With some Xbox Live Points

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
A 1600 prepaid card

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I've played Halo 3 for 15 days

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And it was awesome

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I've also played Guitar Hero Metallica

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
And gotten the easy achievements all the way first

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
I had to fix it for a few hours

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
And I'm having massive fun with this

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
And my TV had no lag

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And was able to set it up to 1080i

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
And then I popped in

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Bring It On and Death Note into the DVD drive

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
And it upscaled the DVD

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
To 1080i resolution

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
My anime has never looked so good

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Thank you Microsoft for creating the Jesus Box

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Now the only three things missing

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
To make my purchase complete

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Is a wireless adapter, 12 month gold

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And a headset

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
This is the eyes of President Cat

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
It's purrrfect

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Peace out DS Master 26

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
P.S. This email is sponsored by

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
The hottest teen stars

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I wish I'd be going out with

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
All three from Disney, oh by the way

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Leave Miley alone and don't criticize her, she's perfect

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I can't believe I just said that

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I know, I'm like

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Did you really just say that on air?

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Bite my ass

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Read the damn email

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Alright, so I only like

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Half heard that email because I'm

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Tallying the votes, so

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Are there questions for us in there or what?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I'm seeing if there's anything else in here, no

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I would though

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Now I need to remember what type of

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Headset that we have

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Because Dan has these cool

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Like I could sit next to him

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And not hear the Xbox at all headphones

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
They're amazing

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
They help me sleep at night

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
It's the best present he's ever gotten me

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Well technically it's the best present he's ever

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Bought in himself for me

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I do have though

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
A little story I could throw in the interim

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Sure, but let me just quickly say

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Last call for listless votes

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
You guys have one minute to get your listless votes in

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Or they will not be counted, one minute for listless votes

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Very heavy participation tonight

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
We're gonna have a good list tonight

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Well, what was going on is

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Basically these

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Geeks

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Team Osaka, from the University of Osaka

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Submitted

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
To the

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
2009 internationally genetically engineered

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Machine competition

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
These

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Engineered bacteria

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
That produce fluorescent proteins

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
And

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Crotonoid pigments

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
To make art out of them

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
And they made one

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Look like Mario

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
They were calling them

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Biobricks

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
So uh

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
There's a picture of Mario

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Made out of bacteria

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
It's bacteria

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
That's freaky

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Genetically engineered bacteria

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
I make genetically engineered

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Next gen

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Biobricks

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
They're kinda murky and brown though

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Stop being gross

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Alright, we're gonna get to the FUs of the week in just a moment here

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
But I was just putting the final touches there

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
On tonight's listless

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Ooh, damn it

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Right after I get them all tallied up

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
One more freaking vote comes in

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Damn you!

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Ok, so that's uh

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Live radio folks, what can you do?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
That's another vote for the number one answer

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
So that's not really gonna change things too much

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Ah

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Sorry, live radio folks

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
We will get to the FUs in just a minute

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
I posted the bacteria Mario

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Alright

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
We'll get to the listless results in just a moment

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
But we are first gonna get to the FUs of the week

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
And we actually have some angst

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
To inspire our FUs of the week

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
But before we can start ranting

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
We need to get our ranty music

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
So please, shligework, take us away

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Here's something to inspire your ranting tonight

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
In the gaming world

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
It's another case of the media runs away

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
With some idiot

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Doing something with video games

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
To make the media run away with games are bad

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Ok?

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
A nine year old boy apparently stabbed to death

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
By a 25 year old friend

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Over a game of Tony Hawk

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
You see, Anthony

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Maldonado was visiting

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
His family in Harlem

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
And they were playing the new Playstation

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
And uh, the killer's name was

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Alejandro Morales, the 25 year old I suppose

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
The boy's family left the

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Nine year old in the care of Alejandro

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
During the night while they were playing the Tony Hawk

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Game, and that's when he stabbed him in the chest

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
The story goes on to say

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
He was a friend, I can't believe this happened

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Da da da, Anthony was playing on Playstation

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
When his friend came in and stabbed him

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
My grandson died over a video game

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Um, I'm not so sure your grandson

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Died over a video game, it's just that you left

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Him under the care of a fucking lunatic

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
And to be fair, you may not have known

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
He was a fucking lunatic

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
That's very tragic that he ended up being a fucking lunatic

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
But something tells me

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
It really has nothing to do with video games

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
This guy, Alejandro

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Was just kind of

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
A fucking lunatic

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Don't say my name

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Don't say my name, Alejandro

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
People are disgusting

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Anyhow, as if that didn't make you angry enough

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
DarkSakura, what is your FU of the week?

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Um

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
My FU of the week is being

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Really, really freaking exhausted

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
For no real reason

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Because, well I thought it was

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Related to some of my vitamins

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
But, I've taken my vitamins

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
And I feel, you know, still tired

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
So I'm just extra exhausted

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Yeah

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Loki?

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
FU to KFC for leaving me

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
At the drive-thru window for about ten minutes

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
While they

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Jacked off, I assume

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Because, um, then the manager

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
The manager comes over and says, has anyone come and helped you?

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I'm like, no, I've been sitting here for ten minutes

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
He's like, oh shit, sorry

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Uh, here's your food

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I'm not gonna charge you for the whole thing

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Oh, well how nice

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Well, except I think he did, so

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Whatever

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
You didn't even get a free cookie for your troubles?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
No, but the chicken was good

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
So it is forgiven

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
All is forgiven

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Uh, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Just FU'd my car for being ghetto

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
It's so ghetto

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
I will have a new car soon

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I have to, I really don't have a choice at this point

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
So I FU'd my car

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
You do have a choice, Rob

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
There's always a choice

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I do, I do, but it's starting to get

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
There is public transportation, Rob

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It's getting to borderline pathetic

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I don't live in a city that has

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Very good public transportation

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
I don't live in New York, I don't live in

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
DC

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
I live in Sacramento

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
That is really

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
About it for what we had scripted

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
For tonight's show

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
So we're going to go ahead and turn it over to

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Last minute stories right after

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I tell you who won the list list tonight

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Here it is, as voted by you the chatters

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
The definitive, and this is it

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
There is no arguing

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
There is no disputing, this is the definitive list

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Of what the public wants in the year 2010 in gaming

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Number three

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Is they want Reggie

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
To apologize at E3

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
And then punch a kid in the face

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
So we all know he means it

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
It's the only way

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
It's the only way, I won't believe him otherwise

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Number two

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
And I don't want to hear any of this

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Blah blah blah, but it's a child

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Blah blah blah

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Just trust me, there's lots of kids out there

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
You've wanted to punch in the face

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Get a parent to sign off on it

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Number two

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
The number two thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Mother three

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Is localized and released

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
So Bobby gets the last laugh after all

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
He ends up on the list there

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Mother three is localized and released is the number two answer

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
On our list tonight

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
And the number one thing you most want to see

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Happen in the year 2010

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
According to our chatters

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
President Cat

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Is finally released on the Wii

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Woooo

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
No surprise there, and by the way

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I just want to point out it wasn't even a freaking close vote

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Tonight, like usually these list lists are kind of close

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
President Cat won in a landslide vote

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
I have a feeling though

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
The chat room might be thinking

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
That that means that then

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
We would actually announce it at E3

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And Loki would wear the tingle costume

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Which technically wasn't part of the answer

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
But I just really like that

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
And maybe that's what they were voting number one

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Does it give you the warm fuzzies?

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
It does, it does, and we'll see

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Hopefully this will be the year for President Cat

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
100 copies my ass

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
That's all I have to say

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Only 100 copies sold, come on

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Come on

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Alright

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
So there you go

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
There's your definitive top three list as voted by the chatters

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Bobby is still trying to dispute the dating sims thing in chat

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Let it go

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Let it go

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Step away

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Let it be

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Alright now we'll do some last minute stories

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
And we'll open up the Skype line

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
1877 Game OLR

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Challenge Radio

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
We'll get to your calls right after some last minute stories

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Loki

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Love the procedurally generated MMO

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Is starting off with some beta testing

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
And that's coming to us

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I guess on January 7th

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Until that time I guess

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Only registrants in the pay-to-play alpha test

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Can log on though unfortunately

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
But

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
That's kind of neat though

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
The game looks interesting though

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Because it's all procedurally generated

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
We'll get to a call, save that thought

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
It's Ray Iyanami

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Hi, we're having a hard time hearing you

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Make sure you're speaking loud and clear into the phone, who's this?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
It's Ray Iyanami

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Much better

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Ray, what's on your mind buddy?

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Not much

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I got my Christmas money

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Like last week

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
So I've been spending it on some games

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Like Raiden 4 and

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Jordan Masters Twinkle

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
You've been playing Raiden 4 and what?

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Jordan Masters Twinkle

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Basically it's a

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Xbox Live Indie Game

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Sport of a PC game called

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Interesting, what was the name of the PC game you dropped out there for a minute there?

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
It's based on what?

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
The original PC game

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
is called Jordan Masters

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
How much

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
How much did it set you back?

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
400 Microsoft points

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
or 5 US dollars

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Gotcha

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
So that's what's going on in your gaming world

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
You've had a chance to catch up on a lot of stuff

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
over the holidays?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Yeah

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I also got

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Admittedly

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Part of the reason I wanted to get it was because

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
it doesn't have the stupid autocorrect feature

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
of the newer DJMax games

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
If you hit the wrong note

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
it'll give you credit for the note

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And I was able to log

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
all the talks in it like within a few days

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
and nothing too difficult

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
and the charts are pretty easy

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
but then again this is a game

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
of characterless new players

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
so I don't hold a grudge against

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Pentavision for that

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Now you sent us

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
You tweeted us about the whole

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
DJMax Technica thing going on

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
What is kind of else's new in the

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
DJMax world? Like are they still supporting

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
that arcade game? I mean the arcade game is very different

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
than the home version of the game

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Have you heard of any plans

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
to give that arcade experience at home

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
or what?

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I haven't heard anything

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
and

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
even if there were plans to make

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
a Technica port for home

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
it would be really hard considering

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
the setup of the arcade game

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
If you were to put on DS

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
you would have to dump that

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
experience in because DS can't support

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
more than two fingerprints at once

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Do you think

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
it might work on a motion control type thing?

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Like maybe if it was pointing at the screen

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
like on the Wii or Natal or something

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
or is that going to just change it too much?

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
It'll probably change it too much

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
The Wii remote would be not

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
the type of stuff

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
One other thing I know you're

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
really into Ray is that you

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
like a lot of the Japanese shmups

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I know you talk a lot about those

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
when you call in. Are there any exciting things

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
to look forward to in 2010?

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Um

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Apparently

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Escalita 2

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
which is also a cave shooter

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
is getting released soon by the

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
also published in the cave and

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
ported by M2, the same people behind

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
the Council for the Adventure of Rebirth

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
which does not allow for it to get downloaded

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Out of curiosity

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Do you play Ikaruga this week too?

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Because it seems like everybody else did but me

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I don't play Ikaruga

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
I haven't played it before

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
but I haven't touched it in years now

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I see. Fair enough

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I think you would be intensely pissed off by it

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Is there anything else?

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Go ahead

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I try to play it

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
just to survive

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
but then I keep hearing the robotic

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
where it's going, watching, watching

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
and now it's pissed me off

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
remind me how bad I am at changing the game

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Mmm

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
It's a very frustrating game

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
you really have to

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I think it's one of those ones that you have to have

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
the experience of playing it so that

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
you start realizing what's coming where

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
and then it's more just one of those technical games

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Yeah, it's like more memorization

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
based than like many other shooters

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
like more memorization

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
based than just like scoring

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
not like it's just a survival art type thing

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
but

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Well, art type I still think is

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
a little bit less of a challenge than

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Ikaruga

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Okay, speaking of art type

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
the art type dimensions

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
on 360 can

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I still refuse to play it

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
because if I try to play it on my

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
arcade stick

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
I wouldn't be able to change the controls

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
since A is below X

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
so I don't have to push my fingers in a rather awkward

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
position just to be able to play

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
because A is to fire an exit

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
to use the force pod

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
See, with that one I really like

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
playing it with the

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
regular controller

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
it's actually pretty cool to me

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
I don't know

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I forgot my

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Street Fighter IV stick

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
I haven't played a single 360 shmup

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
without it besides Omega 5

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
It's kind of interesting how that

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Street Fighter IV stick is really adaptable

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
to lots of different games, isn't it?

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Yeah

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I'm

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
planning on eventually

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
modifying it to have a

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
different kind of stick

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
instead of starting with a 360 shmup

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
because I heard those are

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
better for shmups and other

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
games

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I just wish they'd release a better d-pad

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
so we don't have to spend all this money on these

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
fancy schmancy joysticks

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
but hey, you know, whatever helps bring the experience in

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Even with the d-pad

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
get in your way

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Alright, well Ray, we gotta let you go to get some more

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
calls, but thank you as always for the call and a

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
variety of topics tonight and

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I hope you get all the shmups you want in 2010, okay?

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Hopefully

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Alright, later! Bye

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
1877 Game OLR

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Loki, I rudely cut you off earlier, I apologize

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
but of course our listeners come first, I'm sorry

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
It's alright. Serious Sam

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
HD is coming to Xbox Live

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
this week

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
That was the other thing I was gonna say

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Alright, well we got another call

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
just in time. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Hi, this is

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Spaznato. Hi Spaznato, what's on

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
your mind tonight, buddy?

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
A couple quick things

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Sure

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Since you just got

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
your 360 back

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
there was

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
one game that I

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
seriously recommend

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
that you at least give it a try

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
It came out

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
after your

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
virtual 360 broke

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
It said

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Magic the Gathering

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
dual with the

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
paint walkers

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Funny enough Spaznato

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I had that game for one

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
week before my 360

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
went under. I did buy the full

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
version of that game, because you know, I used to

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
play Magic the Gathering back in the day

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
and when I say back in the day, I mean, I was

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
like 15, I was in high school

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
So if you do the math

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
that was like, literally half my age

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
So, god, Magic's been around

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
forever, hasn't it?

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
But it was really hard for me to remember

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
how to play, but yeah

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
I had a good time with it

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Spaznato, were you a card game

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
player? Did you play Magic as a card game?

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Or was this your first exposure to it?

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Oh, I played

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
in high school

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
just like you

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
In fact, I was

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
a sophomore when I started playing it

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
and an

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
older classmate of mine

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
introduced me to the card

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
game and I got hooked right

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
away and I

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
played it all through high school

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
up until I graduated and then

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
once I hit college

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
and no one

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
around me played Magic the

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Gathering, I kind of gave it up

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
But I tried to

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
play season one

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Magic the Gathering

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
It was loosely based on

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Magic, but it wasn't totally

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
faithful to the card game

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
But

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
the Xbox Live game

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
by comparison

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
is damn good

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Yeah, I had an old, old version

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
on the PC that was released

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
probably around the same time I actually played the game

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Maybe by the time I was a senior in high school or so forth

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
So it's been like 95, 96

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
that this was actually released

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
They had an old PC one that was

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
pretty darn good

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
It had its flaws

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
It wasn't quite as...

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Gosh, in playing the 360 one

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
I never really realized

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
how many phases were in

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
around

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
It's just kind of one of those things that

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
when you're playing the card game

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
it just kind of flows

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
But when you're playing the 360 one, you really see

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
each phase go through

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
It's a pretty complex game

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
It's a pretty easy one to pick up

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I happen to already have the game Spaznator

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
but for those that are curious to

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
pick it up

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
What's the thing you like most

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
about the Magic game?

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Especially for someone who hasn't played the card game

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
What do you think makes the game

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
cool?

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
It's kind of

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
hard to

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
really pronounce words

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
but it's like

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
a combination of

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
getting the cards

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
that you need

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
when you need them

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
and then actually a little bit of know-how

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
and strategy

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
You know

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
You kind of like go

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I can't think of anything

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
to nail these

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I mean nail these off the top of my head

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
but

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
what I just said before

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
it's probably

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
fits the best that I can come up

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
with

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
By the way

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Let me just

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
interject this real quick

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
X-Link posted this in our chat room

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
and this is exactly what I was looking for

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
It's Magic the Gathering

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
This is what always confused me

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
It was also called Duels of the Plainwalkers

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
It was released by Microprose in 1997

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
So a little later than I thought it was

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I remember that you would get

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
a big oversized card that came

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
in the box that I thought was kind of funny

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
with the game

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I totally used to use

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
the candelabra

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
to bring it into my regular deck

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
They had

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
an astral set

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
a set of cards that were specifically

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
in the game

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Sorry

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
It was a whole little game that came out many years ago

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
It was still good

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
It was much different

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Rob, that totally reminded me

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
of my other big thing of Geekery

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I was using that same card to bring Captain Picard

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
into my deck

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
How do you do that?

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
It was like two combinations of cards

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
where you can bring any outside card

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
and put it in your graveyard

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
and then another one to recycle your graveyard

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
into your deck

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
That is crazy

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
So bring out Captain Picard

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
And what would the random card do?

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Did it get stats of any sort?

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Well I didn't have to cast anything

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
because I didn't have anything to cast

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
I always would say he'd rally my troops

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Nice

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Sorry for the bit of random and spazzinator

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
What else is on your mind besides magic?

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Two more

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
quick hits

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
I know that you

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
specifically aren't really too

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
fortunate

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
I don't know about

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Dark Sakura or Loki

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
or any of the other listeners

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
but I happen to notice

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
that over on

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
the PlayStation Network

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
store, specifically the

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
video site, they actually

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
got some sports programming

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
on there like

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
old NHL games

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
NBA games

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
NCAA football games

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
a little bit of everything

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
over there

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I can't

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
speak

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
into well enough

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
they got the same thing over on

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
the Xbox Live

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
marketplace or not, it's been a while since

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I checked out the video content over there

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
but if you happen to

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
like watching sports and there's nothing

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
good on regular TV

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
you know there's always that

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I just happened to recently

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
buy an old

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
old hockey game

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
and

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
the Fiesta

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Bowl from 2009

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
just validated

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
worked pretty good

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
you know and X-Link in chat

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
chimes into the sports

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I have to be honest, I don't

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
serve the video marketplace very often because I have

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Netflix and usually that kind of fills in

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
my video needs

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
but

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
it's interesting that

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
that exists

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
because if you saw a really awesome

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
play in a game or what have you

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
that's literally content on demand

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
but I don't know

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
it doesn't seem like that would be very

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
popular to watch a game and download it

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
long after it's been played

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
when you read about it on your favorite

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
sports or see it on ESPN the next day

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
but hey I guess if there's that one awesome play

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
or something really epic happens in the game

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
you can download it and watch it forever

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
even though it would be on YouTube too

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
yeah true

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
and you know

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I'm not exactly the biggest

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
sports game out there

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
on Far From It

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
it's kind of weird because I'm from

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
a sports crazy city

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
but once in a great while

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I do like to watch a game of

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
some sort and

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I figure kind of like what the hell

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'll get that, there's nothing on the record

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
TV

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
it's kind of like

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
impulse buy

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
you know what if there's a buck to be made

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
off of the game and if they even make

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
$50 off the encoding and what have you

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
they'll probably do it

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
quickly what was your other thing, you said you had one other thing

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
and then we gotta let you go to get more calls

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
yeah

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I had a relatively minor

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
bone to pick

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
with your number one

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
pick for listless

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
yeah, why is that?

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
well

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Bobby said

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
what I was thinking

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
is that

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
X-Play

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
is nearly as big

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
a screen as not the greatest

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
show there ever is

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
or was, but

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
not quite as bad as

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Alpha People

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
in fact

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
that's one of those

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
several searches I

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
gave me news from

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I think that

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
is as well, but

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
it isn't

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
all bad

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I might be

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
digging up old old stuff here

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
but let's not forget this is the show that thought Beatmania

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
was newer than Guitar Hero

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I'm just, you know

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
sometimes the quality of the show

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
needs a little work, obviously

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I'm picking on them because I can, but

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
you know

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I don't know, I think the quality of gaming

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
television overall could be a little better

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
if somebody would just, would just try

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
alright

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
quickly

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
I ran out of cable

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
for like a year or so

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
but you know, there's one

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
thing I took into consideration

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
when I talk to people

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
alright, fair enough, alright Spaznator we gotta let you go

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
but take care, and have a good one, ok?

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
yep, you too

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
have a good one

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
and you know, I will give you guys that, it is the one remaining

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
tech TV show, but you know that in itself

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
is a bit of an atrocity, I mean there were so many

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
good tech TV shows

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
blah blah blah, this argument is

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
years old, it is what it is, it ain't coming back

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
this ain't the way they used to be, and that's just what we're gonna

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
have to deal with

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
we'll try to get at least one more call in before we close up

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
shop tonight, do we have any other last minute

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
stories, Loki?

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
uh

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
maybe

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
yeah, there's new

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Dragon Age Origins

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
download content coming out on January 5th

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
on PC and Xbox

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
360, it's gonna be coming out later in

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
January, on PlayStation 3

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
it's the return of Ostegar

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
let me get to the phones, hi you're on

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
this is dsmaster26

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
hey dsmaster, what's on your mind?

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
not much, I've been still

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
pretty pumped about

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
getting a 360

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
probably the best

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
game system I've ever owned

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
since the PS2

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
run that by me again

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
because you're a little quiet tonight, you're mad about

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
getting a 360 or what?

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
no, no, I'm happy

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
about getting a 360

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
did you get a 360 too?

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
it was the email I read, Rob

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
oh, sorry, I was telling you

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
no offense, but I was

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
having a really hard time reading your email because

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
you don't really use punctuation

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
oh, sorry

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
I was kind of writing it on the quick

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
have you seen that Facebook group that's

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
called, um, there's a big difference

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
between Let's Eat, Grandma

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
and Let's Eat, Grandma

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I need to join that

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
because I'm actually a member of like four different

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
grammar forums

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
did you see the calendar I bought?

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
I get it, Eat, Shoots, and Leaves

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
I have not

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
seen that, but

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
if anything, I've been playing a whole

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
lot load of Halo 3

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
before Reach comes out

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
and I'm probably going to pick up Halo 1

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
and 2 and 3 ODFT

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
possibly when that comes out

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
and try to

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
gain up on the Halo story in a sense

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
are there still lots

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
of people playing Halo 3 online?

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
is it still as crazy popular as like Halo 2

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
is still being played online like five years after

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
it was out

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
yes, and there's still people playing

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Halo 2 if you can believe it

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I do believe it

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
because some, you know, 360s are

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
still expensive, there's a heck of people probably

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
still on the original Xbox, although then again

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
you're paying for Xbox Live

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
well, well, well, whatever

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
and actually apparently I read an article

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
on Kotaku

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
that said it's because of Halo 2

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
that we have the friend cap of

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
100 for the 360

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
that's right, I've

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
heard this come up, I think Bobby's

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
discussed this on his show before, I think I've heard him talk

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
about it where the whole

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
friend cap of 100, Halo 2 is

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
to blame because people are still playing

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
that, so in order for them to break the 100 cap

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
they would essentially have to disable Halo 2

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
which I don't think anyone wants to happen anytime soon

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
let me ask you this

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
DS Master, because you're a big Halo fan

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
what do you think of Halo Reach

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
is on its way this year?

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Are you excited for that?

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Well, I'm not really a Halo fan, but I'm like

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
I wanted a really good

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
first person shooter on a console

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
and after pulling

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
my troops holiday party

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
for Boy Scouts, which we do every year

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
like, it was so much fun

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
I was just like

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
holy crap, I'm finally getting the hang of this

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
playing a console FPS

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
after playing

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Quake Live for nearly a year or two

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I think I've told this story on the show before

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
but the very first time I ever played Halo was at a

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
wedding reception and that's where I actually had

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
a whole lot of fun, was shooting up

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
the wedding party, I shit you not, that's

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
the first time I ever played Halo

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
it was a good time

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
and actually our longest session was probably 2 hours

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
49 minutes and 19 seconds

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Good lord

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Then quickly, if you

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
are into first person shooters, what do you think

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
about the idea of turning them all into dating sims?

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Please, I mean

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
it's enough of a dating sim with the girl gamers

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
trying to hit up on the gamer guys

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
on Xbox 5

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Well, so who says it has to be a girls

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
and guys thing, I mean, you can have all different types

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
of dating sims and so forth

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
No kidding, I mean, that is

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
true, and

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
clearly from shivering and what not

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
it's cold in Nebraska, it sucks

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
You need to get shot with a

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
hug gun, I think is what needs to happen

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
You need to log into Halo and somebody needs to

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
shoot you with a hug gun

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Alright, DS Master, I gotta let you go

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
call and your email and so forth, you take care, okay?

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Peace out, keep the good shows rocking

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Peace out, hero

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
We'll try, later

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Alright,

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Sorry those didn't get through, but remember you can send us an email

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
It's okay, I mean, there was only one in the email

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
bag tonight, and then the person got through on the phone

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
anyway, but we can't control it

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
We don't have a call screener

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
We can't afford one

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Maybe in the future, we'll see

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Anyhow, we're gonna start to close up

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
shop here, because believe it or not, we've been on air for about

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
three hours, I know it might

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
not feel like that on the podcast because you do a little break

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
in the middle of life, but it's still gonna be a long

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
show tonight, and a good show, good

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
first show of the year

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Set the tone for the rest of the year, hopefully

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
We'll be back to do it all again next week

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
I do want to ask real quick though, if there's any other last minute stories

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
before we wrap it up tonight, I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
had anything else to throw out there, I know I don't

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Loki's shaking his head no

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
I found the best book, it has nothing to do with games

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Well, books are important too

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I found the best book that's called

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Why is Daddy in a Dress?

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Answering Awkward Questions with Baby Animals

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
This is the best

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Look, Rob

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Why is Daddy in a Dress?

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Okay

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
And here's one of the pages

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
How much for happy and wow

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
You used to hate that when you were doing massage classes

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Well that's why I was laughing because

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
it just made me go wow

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
but it's cute with little kittens

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
There's one of like a little puppy

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
that said, um, are you

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
like, um

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
like, if, why does Daddy look like

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
the pool boy?

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Um, I gotta read this comment

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
from Marissa and I hope she doesn't mind me

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
reading a private message publicly

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
I told her to send it to you

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
She said that they were just having a discussion

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
at her house about punctuation

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Capitalization is important too

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
because like, for instance, you might have

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
you know, capitalization could change this sentence

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
um, help your uncle jack off the horse

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
you know, like, like, help him get off

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
the horse and so forth and you know

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
he's, he's, you know, old and needs assistance

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
getting off the horse, or if you didn't capitalize

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
that right, it might read as

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
help your uncle jack off the horse

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
as in

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
you need samples

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
for mating purposes

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
or whatever

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Capitalization

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
and punctuation are important

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
I love those little kitten postcards

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
those are adorable

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
I don't want them. Alright, anyhow, uh

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
let's go around and get everybody's

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
stop giggling

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
and wrap up the show tonight

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
It's another great episode of Oral R and the Cannon

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Um, hopefully

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
I'll play Borderlands this week

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Um, my final thought is

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
um, hopefully I'll get to play

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
one of the, like, 50 games

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
um, that I have

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
in my queue of games to play

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
uh, this week, get to spend more time

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
with that, but I'll probably be too busy trying to finish

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Symphony of the Night and making progress in

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Shadow Complex

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
and eventually playing Morrowind

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Too many things to do

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Uh, Dark Saga, your final thought tonight?

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Um, yeah

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Uh, that's gonna do it. Thank you guys so much

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
