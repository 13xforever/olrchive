15435	15716	to 2010.
16377	24116	Microsoft shows us their game room at CES, a popular Nintendo Wii game is no longer being published, and could NBA Jam be making a comeback?
31192	31793	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
49813	50393	Frustrated.
50733	51434	I'm sorry to hear that.
51474	52334	Why are you frustrated?
52454	56636	Because I realized that I started stitching in two wide stitches.
56977	61259	Well, actually, stitches too many on this tube scarf I was making.
61879	64440	So now I have a doll-sized tube dress.
65181	68302	Well, you know, if you decide that you don't want it, you could always set it on fire.
68863	69743	That would be pretty amazing.
70223	72444	But that would mean setting my stuff on fire.
73045	75426	Well, you know, at least you could watch it go down in a blaze of glory.
77293	80178	Also say hello to the one and only Pyromaniac Techmaster Loki!
80619	80960	Hello.
81140	81561	How are you?
82242	82863	I'm fine.
82903	84106	Have you set fire to anything this week?
85611	86771	No, not this time.
112657	113437	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
131906	134288	Translation, give us jobs.
135228	136489	Professional jobs.
136669	137970	Here's the thing.
138150	142413	We don't hang out a lot like we used to during the week.
142493	144514	This show is kind of the way we all hang out.
145095	147576	Once in a while, there's a party or something's going on.
148357	149518	It's not like we avoid each other.
149538	150818	It's just we're all busy.
150878	151879	I work a day job.
152119	154181	DarkSakura has school and other things she's got to do.
154201	154601	I'm avoiding you.
156195	162120	and Loki just bought a house and they both have the married life going on and I'm driving to the Bay Area for stuff all the time.
163001	164482	We don't see each other an awful lot during the week.
165103	166444	But this week was a little different.
166504	168106	We actually went on an OLR date.
169417	197790	DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all went to see Avatar as many of you have apparently because it's already like the number three highest grossing movie ever and it looks like based on the take this week there's a very good chance it's going to take over the Batman movie they're saying it could even take over Titanic so a lot of you have seen the movie so I don't know if we're going to sit here and review it because most of you have already seen it it sounds like but how about our thoughts on the movie because we did get to see it in 3D
199111	203194	Which I thought was, you know, kind of different because I don't see a lot of movies in 3D.
203274	204335	I mean, it's kind of a new thing.
204655	209039	The only other movie I've seen in 3D was Up, which, you know, didn't use the 3D as heavily.
209059	214323	Like, I didn't think the 3D kind of added a lot to Up, but certainly Avatar kind of added some stuff to it.
214583	215704	Loki, what did you think of Avatar?
215724	216965	This is your second time seeing it, right?
217325	217786	Yes, it is.
219467	223330	By the way, keep it spoiler free because some of our chatters have not seen it yet and want to.
224059	225199	Have you seen Pocahontas?
225559	227480	You've seen Avatar.
227980	229341	I call it Space Pocahontas.
229661	230361	Or Ferngully.
231261	234142	Ferngully meets Pocahontas in space with Smurfs.
234902	239924	No, I like just... Even the technology behind the whole movie is pretty awesome.
239984	248387	Like a lot of the 3D stuff, it's not so much, you know, Hey, look, we made a 3D movie, so we're going to have tons of stuff flying at your face.
248647	249087	Or, you know...
250000	251162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
267697	268537	DarkSakura, what did you think?
268557	271879	I had very low expectations and then my expectations were sort of pooped on.
295549	296270	I thought it was really good.
317025	321466	I think that the 3D was implemented very, very nicely.
321526	328548	Instead of, like Loki said, of it being 3D, it was more immersive.
329048	340110	There were a few things, though, that did surprise me as far as just... I really have no other comparison to put this to, but the head tracking mode for Wii, that little hack...
340690	367664	it made me think of that because it almost felt sometimes like you could peek around the screen and see stuff inside of it or if you moved closer you'd get a wider view it was that kind of immersion and it actually did not give me a headache because the other movies I've seen in 3D was I saw Nightmare Before Christmas twice in IMAX in 3D and that gave me kind of a headache and made me pass out I was explaining that I have a problem with 3D because I tend to get really motion sick
368684	374770	But, I think I only got motion sick once, and that was in the flying, one of the big flying scenes.
375790	395648	And, other than that, I mean, especially since I wear glasses and was wearing the 3D glasses over my glasses, I didn't really have as bad of a problem as I expected to, except when I took the 3D glasses off, I had a big adjustment because, you know, I'm looking through two lenses trying to get the 3D effect out of it.
396328	398569	Story-wise, yeah, predictable.
398709	406071	We saw this coming, but it was predictable in a gratifying way, I want to say, if that makes sense.
406251	410932	Yeah, that's a little bit more than what I thought would happen with it.
411172	412132	Yeah, that's how that should go.
412672	414013	I'm fine with that.
415053	416533	I liked it.
416733	418354	I was already looking up stuff online.
418374	419094	There's going to be a sequel.
420134	447640	Which I'm looking forward to Although I'm wondering what direction they're going to go with it But yeah, actually I'm really impressed As a language nerd, I was very impressed with the construction of the language Yeah, I guess they built that language for the movie Like some professor at a university did it Yeah, a linguistics professor created the language And it actually, with some of the other ones that I've studied It uses, actually the grammar structure is very similar to American Sign Language
448860	455684	and I noticed it actually has things in common with Japanese and with American Sign Language in terms of your object order.
456505	458786	So I was actually pretty pleased with that.
460207	465791	Reading just so much more into it, I have to say that I'm impressed overall with the work that went into it.
466391	472195	And with the fluidity of the motion capture, that was very impressive and I know that that was a pretty new technology that they used with it too.
473075	477078	I also went back and read an interview as to why people were blue.
477958	488927	Because, and to paraphrase the quote, it's that, well, it was to contrast with the skin tones of humans, first of all, to enhance the bioluminescence, because everything on the planet was bioluminescent.
489488	491549	And also, because they'd already done Little Green Men.
492290	493011	They wanted them to be blue.
493951	494171	Nice.
494532	494692	Yeah.
494992	504280	So, overall, I have to say, I like a movie that a lot of thought and energy had been put into, and it was very clear that a lot of work went into this, and you could see it in the final production, so...
506507	508289	And that and I wanted to punch that guy in the face.
510591	512532	Not the Marine.
512873	513473	The Colonel guy.
513753	516095	Yeah, because he actually, he's what I expected him to be.
516816	518638	I wanted no redemption out of him.
519919	521060	I'm not trying to spoil anything.
521100	522120	I know most of you have seen it.
522561	523962	I wanted no redemption out of him.
524082	526524	I wanted him to be a hard ass to the end and he sure was.
527365	528926	But it was the corporate guy.
529246	532769	Because you could almost see him thinking about it.
533770	535290	and then, ooh, dollars.
536191	538031	And I've seen him in other stuff and I can't think of what.
539011	539892	You gotta IMDB it.
540232	541512	Yeah.
541912	546033	You might remember, I kind of came out before this movie and I was like, I just hope it tanks.
546213	553515	Like, it looks terrible from the trailer and James Cameron's kind of an arrogant ass and, you know, just after Titanic, I just kind of wanted to see the movie tank.
554295	556216	So I went in with very low expectations.
556256	557236	Like, I was kind of like DarkSakura.
557256	557476	I was like...
558116	559277	All right, what the hell?
559577	560098	I'll go.
560218	561899	I got three hours to kill.
561939	563140	Let's go see the damn movie.
564301	565102	I was wrong.
565402	566342	It was good.
566663	567924	It was a good movie.
568524	569665	Props to Cameron.
569685	570406	You did it again.
570626	571827	It was good.
572307	576650	Was it like OMG Oscar-winning story and all this?
576770	577091	No.
577151	579713	I mean, the story you've kind of heard before, but it's effective.
580373	596524	and I know here we are a video game podcast talking about movies but I want to kind of bring this back to video games a little bit because honestly I kind of thought the movie was just a giant video game like the graphics were really good in Avatar you know and that's kind of one of the things I was like wow the landscape is really pretty the um the
597404	601568	The way the Navi were done was really pretty, and just everything about the movie was really, really pretty.
602108	608954	And so the game had great graphics, and even the story, I gotta be honest, the story, without getting into spoilery, I was really reminded of Final Fantasy VII.
609395	617502	There was a lot of tie-ins to me with Final Fantasy VII, and you have to admit, there was an epic boss battle at the end of the movie, which is to be expected.
617542	618382	It really was epic.
618462	621285	Also, that guy, I actually remember him from My Name is Earl.
622351	622871	Ah, there you go.
624132	625613	So it was very epic.
625913	637379	I think in some ways, and this is going to sound like a much bigger compliment than maybe the movie actually deserves, but I actually think in some ways, this movie is going to be like this generation's Wizard of Oz.
638239	641881	Because if you think about it, the Wizard of Oz was actually not like...
642950	653077	That great of a movie, but it's one of those ones we kind of all remember because it was that musical that we all remember, and it was that color.
653097	656119	It was the first color movie we all kind of remember.
656159	660242	Obviously, not all of us were alive when that movie first came out, but it meant a lot for color.
660542	665925	And I think Avatar is going to be a lot of that for 3D, even though it might not be the best or most original story in the world.
666526	671589	I think they're going to look back on this years from now and say, this is when 3D started being a big thing.
673470	677752	I'm kind of, I'm a little worried about it, because I gotta say, the 3D kind of bugged me.
678212	686795	Like, it wasn't, and I didn't think it was gimmicky or anything like that, but the 3D bugged me because I had to take those glasses off, like, every 10 minutes, because I actually was, like, hurting my eyes.
687296	689396	And the same thing kind of happened when I was watching Up.
689496	692798	Like, I just, I can't sit there and do the 3D the whole time.
693138	694598	It's kind of a pain in my eyes.
695099	700601	So, that was the only, I mean, it looked nice, don't get me wrong, and I thought it definitely was kind of like something I haven't seen before, but
701041	701541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
716969	718190	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
733888	736770	But they're talking about ESPN and 3D and all this stuff.
737030	742614	I realize nobody's going to make me tune to that network, but it's definitely kind of the wave of the future.
743335	745116	I hope they find a way to make it less painful.
746277	748679	Go to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
749079	752021	Alpha Cananogram says, Sky said the game had good graphics.
752322	752842	LMFAO.
753102	753863	Yeah, I mean, seriously, I...
754523	756684	I found the movie to be very much like a video game.
756724	759345	It was kind of a cliche plot, but it was executed very well.
759485	761186	I'm not saying it was executed very, very well.
761526	762987	I actually think, what's her name?
763347	766748	That Zoe Saladona, the one that was Uhura in Star Trek.
767309	769290	Dude, she should get nominated for an Oscar.
770050	770770	I honestly mean that.
770790	773511	She was amazingly good.
773791	775332	And Sigourney Weaver, oh my god.
775672	776012	Love her.
776333	778694	I do have to tell you, the full thing is going to be in the DVD, right?
779514	781895	I don't think there was one in Titanic.
781915	782656	Yeah, but Aliens High.
810385	812448	So anyway, reading some other comments from chat.
812728	814070	SSJ100Matt says, Terminator 2.
814551	815452	I wouldn't go that far.
815572	818896	It was okay, but I don't see it lasting the test of time like Wizard of Oz.
820215	821376	I think it's too early to say.
821696	827640	Again, I don't think people are going to go back and go, oh, this is just a phenomenal fucking movie, like the Lord of the Rings will be.
827680	829001	I think they're going to look back on that a long time.
829021	829281	I don't know.
829301	840609	I went back to The Wizard of Oz after a while because I used to like that movie, and I find it really grating on my ears now, and just a really annoying, awful movie.
841230	846873	So I don't know if Wizard of Oz has lasted the test of time either because you watch it and you're like...
847754	848956	Return to Oz was based off the books.
848976	850818	As they should do some more movies based off the books.
863994	867576	SSJ100 Matt in chat says also, I don't think the 3D added all that much to it.
867616	868417	It was nice without it.
868677	869477	You know, I kind of agree.
869517	872259	I think I would have still felt the same about the movie had I seen it in 2D.
872619	875881	But 3D did give that little extra kick.
876161	879143	You know, that little extra wow factor that really brought the...
880083	882824	and graphics, so to speak, home.
883024	884564	That planet was beautiful.
885144	886525	And I'm actually excited to play the game.
886725	889645	And sure enough, Loki managed to... Not only did he get us free tickets to the movie.
889665	890405	Thank you very much, Loki.
890426	890926	We appreciate it.
891306	893666	Now he scrounged up a copy of Avatar the Game on PlayStation 3.
893906	898067	So DarkSakura and I are going to kind of trade it back and forth since I'm going to be traveling this next week.
898087	899448	She's going to borrow it and then I'm going to take it.
899468	901408	Too bad you don't have a 3D TV because that isn't 3D if you have a 3D TV.
901428	901988	That's what I hear.
902108	902508	You know what?
902608	903289	I'll pass anyway.
904609	906609	Well, no, I think that my TV's capable.
906629	908890	Do you have the glasses for it?
909577	911760	I stole the ones from the theater.
912360	919248	Different TVs have different 3D, unless your TV supports RealD, then those glasses will work with that.
919668	924594	If they don't, or if it doesn't, then you may need shutter glasses or something like that.
924774	929299	We've actually got shutter glasses for the Master System.
931820	933141	In the theater, though.
953912	955594	3D and Coraline was awesome.
955874	958536	They did the same type of thing they did in Avatar, right?
958596	960238	The real 3D or whatever it's called, right?
960918	965122	I think real D would be the best option because those shutter glasses are expensive.
965142	966403	They're like $200 a piece.
966483	970327	If you're going to get some for your friends and stuff like that, forget about it.
970447	974931	But real D, those glasses are so damn cheap to manufacture.
975271	978374	It's almost as cheap as the red-blue glasses, but
979708	980329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
997230	1003397	Whatever they do with the home version, whether it be the Red Blue or the Real D, but you'd have to have a TV.
1003457	1007201	I don't know what the hell they're going to do.
1007381	1008622	I think it will come over to games.
1009002	1011725	Where the movie goes, games will soon go.
1011945	1017932	And this might be something that's in the PlayStation 4, the Xbox 720, and whatever other hypothetical system you want to come up with.
1018933	1019914	I just kind of hope...
1021400	1028204	Again, they find a way to make it easier on the eyes and that they don't rely on it as a crutch, that it gets too gimmicky.
1029525	1032667	You know, it's going to be the gimmick for the first year it comes out.
1033127	1037450	They're going to overdo it with everything and then they're going to slack back off just like with everything else.
1037470	1037970	Oh, like the Wii.
1039651	1039931	All right.
1040771	1041932	Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1041992	1042533	Enough movies.
1042573	1044494	Let's actually talk about the video games we've been playing this week.
1044774	1046355	Dark Sakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
1047534	1049376	Well, mostly watching Dan play Borderlands.
1050217	1057042	I played Luminous on Steam, and then was very disappointed to realize that Shining wasn't in it.
1058103	1059684	And, of course, Peggle.
1060065	1065709	I finally beat one of those crappy extra point levels, you know, that I was yelling at.
1066670	1072095	And once I did it, I actually managed to beat another one after that, but now I'm on the million point level, and I'm like, oh, whatever.
1072915	1073095	So...
1076018	1082781	Also, I've got Silent Hill Shattered Memories, but I haven't had a chance to play it because, again, I haven't been able to get Dan's butt off of Borderlands.
1083742	1086743	And he hasn't got me Bayonetta yet, which makes me weep.
1088204	1089845	You've got to get him to get that for you.
1090545	1090786	All right.
1092647	1093447	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1094189	1095929	Real quick to go back to what we were talking about before.
1096290	1099850	Remember how they were talking about 3D TV at CES?
1100050	1103931	Well, the format that they're kind of working towards is RealD, actually.
1104011	1105211	So that would be kind of cool.
1106052	1111593	And they're, I guess, partnering with Sony, JVC, Samsung, Toshiba, Panasonic, and DirecTV.
1112413	1116714	So... That would be the best way to go, I think.
1116874	1118734	Because, like I said, glasses are cheap.
1120615	1121135	Non-intrusive.
1121275	1122255	Anyways, so games.
1122615	1122695	Um...
1123689	1128110	I actually got to play some of the stuff I've been meaning to play and putting off for a while.
1128531	1131451	I finally played Borderlands and it's awesome.
1132232	1133092	Very fun game.
1133512	1135893	I've actually played it for a few hours.
1135933	1142355	I'm only like level 7 right now, but I did finish killing Nineto, which is one of the characters in the game.
1143155	1165437	and, um, I don't know, the game itself reminds me a lot of, um, Final Fantasy XI with guns, because a lot of the enemies and stuff, they have, like, certain spawn points in the game, and it just, like, you see them kind of just wandering around and stuff like that, like you would in Final Fantasy VII, just without all the other people running around with you, and you have kind of different zones you can kind of zone into to, um...
1167659	1168480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1192765	1193146	DarkSakura
1204375	1215861	but it's just, it's really cool and I'm really disappointed that it took me so long to play the game but I definitely will be playing it for a long time and probably will download the download content later on as soon as I get a little further in the game.
1215981	1217702	Must play The Island of Dr. Ned.
1218763	1221564	It's all about shooting brains out of their skulls.
1222425	1223045	Seriously.
1223886	1224126	Awesome.
1224146	1226087	You guys are making me want to play this game very badly.
1226267	1226787	Get it, Rob.
1226807	1227127	Play it.
1227287	1228607	I can't play it, you know.
1228687	1233629	When I talk about my gaming week, I'll tell you why I can't play Borderlands yet because I'm too distracted.
1234069	1236990	The other thing is non-gaming.
1237030	1239010	Well, I've also been playing Grand Theft Auto.
1239030	1249513	I actually played some Grand Theft Auto this weekend because I was trying to just play some more online games just with some other people other than my coworkers and stuff because I've been kicking the crap out of my coworkers a lot.
1249813	1250033	So modest.
1274580	1275760	and a lot of them dropped.
1275961	1286064	And there's even people that were blatantly cheating using lag switches and turbo controllers and stuff like that and I still kicked the crap out of them.
1287585	1289786	I don't know what to do and everybody keeps dropping.
1290506	1292907	I really hate that everybody drops out of the games.
1293867	1296588	Seriously, just try a little bit.
1296628	1301930	Maybe you'll learn something and get a little bit better instead of just quitting because you just can't seem to kill somebody.
1303851	1304171	I don't know.
1304696	1329991	whatever but um so yeah I've been I've been working my way up the ranks um right now I think I'm in the I know I'm in the top 300 on um Lost and Damned out of ranked death matches um probably up 250 by now but I've been working my way up to number one so uh hopefully I'll hit that at some point I know I'm you know up there whereas my other co-workers are in the 700s to 1000s so um
1334189	1342718	I'm just looking for a challenge out there, and I really hope that people that play online would stop dropping, because it's ridiculous and very frustrating.
1342738	1354171	And, let's see, other than Xbox 360 stuff, I worked on the cabinet a little bit more, played a little bit of tubing this week, because...
1355086	1356907	Jim came over and he wanted to play Tubin.
1357288	1360330	So I tried that and man, that's hard to control.
1360970	1363432	I forgot how hard that game was.
1364152	1364993	So that was kind of cool.
1365113	1370677	And then next week I should be getting some Xbox 360 repair kits for the Red Ring of Death stuff.
1371117	1372978	Mainly just because I didn't really want to send out.
1373118	1376781	I have like six systems just waiting to be repaired.
1377882	1379503	One of them I can actually send back to Microsoft.
1379523	1381204	The other few of them...
1382935	1384696	I'm just going to try to repair it real quick.
1384837	1388960	If it doesn't work, then oh well, I'll just send it out to somebody to repair it.
1389480	1393043	But, you know, I had one that I repaired and it worked for a while.
1393524	1394965	So, you know, we'll give it a shot.
1395925	1400009	And I also got a... What is it?
1401690	1402551	Not a Cyclops.
1402911	1408816	A Cygnus II mod chip for one of my 360s.
1408916	1412439	So I'm going to play with that, assuming I can get it soldered on there, because...
1413786	1414166	I don't know.
1414186	1418129	I had good luck with my Wii mod chip.
1418149	1419690	I was able to solder that.
1420531	1425914	Not so much with my PSP when I tried modding that into the arcade cabinet.
1427751	1428171	I'm 50-50 right now.
1453061	1455762	They have crap on their board where nothing wants to solder to it anyway.
1456443	1459764	I don't know if it came up on last week's show because I think the exchange happened before the show.
1459784	1463066	But I gave Loki my old 360, the one that broke, for him to try to fix.
1463586	1466248	I hope it's one that comes out okay.
1466268	1468869	And I told Loki he could keep it if he fixes it because I have a new one now.
1469189	1472491	So he could use it for his Grand Theft Auto deathmatches, work, whatever he's going to do with it.
1473371	1474672	Whatever machine he wants to build, I don't care.
1474692	1475932	Getting rid of it is really what it is.
1476552	1478674	Literally, people keep giving me 360s.
1478774	1480354	They're all, hey, it's broken.
1480374	1481055	I bought another one.
1481095	1481435	Here you go.
1481835	1482516	Oh, funny.
1482536	1483297	Awesome!
1483377	1488284	I'll tell you what, if you get one working, I'll totally buy a mod chip if you want to get rid of one.
1490187	1491188	What do you mean, buy a mod chip?
1491589	1494954	Like, if you get rid of any of them and would mod it.
1495785	1498386	Well, it all depends on what firmware some of them are.
1498466	1505368	I know my sister's console, the one she was using, if I can get that fixed, is an old enough firmware where I can run the mod chip on it.
1505888	1512210	The other one's not so sure because we were using those and they were pretty much updated.
1512330	1513890	So those may not work.
1514430	1515270	I just have to look at them.
1516111	1518211	But there may be one or two of them that might work.
1518411	1519171	At least one I know.
1519392	1521372	So that's why I only got one mod chip.
1522012	1524433	Yeah, I'm fine.
1526508	1527689	Alright, anyway, my gaming week.
1527949	1531192	I played a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff this week, so let me try to run down it really quick.
1531813	1534215	I played off a listener tip last week.
1534335	1535236	It came in on Twitter.
1535536	1541181	Somebody told me there was this game on the Windows Live server, the games for Windows Live that's free if you download it.
1541761	1544184	Tinker is the name of the game, and I played it.
1544284	1550529	And when we brought it up on the show last week, we were talking about how the game has achievements, and we weren't sure how it interfaced with Xbox Live.
1550829	1551390	Dude, ick.
1552090	1553650	Interface is really good with Xbox Live.
1553690	1555791	Those achievements do count towards your gamer score.
1556471	1560492	It will even come up, like if I look on my recent games on the Xbox 360, I see Tinker.
1560552	1562152	I see a card for it with all the achievements.
1562412	1564132	And I can look at it just like it's any other game on my 360.
1564212	1566393	I kind of thought that was cool.
1566693	1575594	And then when I was actually playing the game, you could access an Xbox Live-ish type of interface where I could see my friends that were online playing Xbox Live.
1575894	1578735	And I'm sure if they were looking at me, they would see me playing the Tinker game.
1579255	1581880	As far as Tinker itself, it's a free game.
1583311	1584532	and that's pretty much what it's worth.
1584592	1588915	I mean, it's a puzzle game that's not very different than things we've seen before.
1588975	1600883	It kind of takes the theme of a child's room and kind of takes this 3D isometric approach to get the robot from point A to B, but you have to use switches and there's toy guns and dominoes and dice and things that get in the way.
1601643	1602104	It's free.
1602424	1603805	It's worth just playing for a little bit.
1603865	1610189	Hey, if you're an achievement score whore, go download it for like 30 gamerscore pretty easy just by beating the tutorial levels.
1610509	1611370	It's not that hard to do.
1613591	1618336	You know, it was cute, but I wouldn't have paid a lot of money for it because it's a puzzle we've seen before.
1618657	1624483	And I don't like the 3D thing because in later levels, they're like, you have to turn the camera around to be able to see everything.
1624783	1627126	But when you turn the camera around, it's not very seamless.
1627186	1631130	It's just kind of like flips the screen 90 degrees by redisplay.
1631150	1635054	Like, it doesn't actually show the screen rotating like I think we've come to expect.
1635094	1635534	It just kind of...
1636255	1636795	Thanks for watching!
1654100	1664285	I spent a little bit of time just playing some various Xbox Live Arcade games because there were some that I hadn't really played a whole lot of, like Sonic 2 and R-Type, a lot of the classically redone ones.
1664505	1669487	I have to admit, R-Type, when you play it in crazy camera mode where it's all like that tilted 3D, it's kind of cool.
1670087	1670948	Hard to play, but cool.
1670988	1673929	Isn't, though, just the remixed versions...
1674889	1676850	I was pretty impressed.
1677051	1677511	Yeah, it's nice.
1678551	1680132	But R-Type is still fucking hard.
1680192	1684755	I forgot to say the other game that we had going on was Raiden 4, and you should give that a try.
1684975	1685715	It actually was really fun.
1687436	1694540	Also, I played quite a bit of Bayonetta on the 360, checked out the game this week, and I love it.
1694860	1695901	It's great.
1696602	1697463	It's over the top.
1697603	1698324	It's excess.
1699245	1706853	We were kind of watching the introduction movie just laughing and laughing because it's so over the top and so unnecessary, but great.
1706953	1708996	Like, I can't even explain it.
1709456	1711178	The game is a bit of a button masher.
1711298	1715964	I mean, you just kind of punch, punch, kick, kick, dodge, but I don't think it really has to be.
1716464	1716745	Like...
1717225	1718506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1738666	1744273	But in the end, I kind of felt that the game is rewarding and there was a lot more depth to it than I was getting the impression from the demo.
1744774	1747357	I honestly have to say, this is one of the better games I've played on the 360.
1747657	1749239	I am having that much fun with it.
1749640	1750340	It's fun.
1750761	1751642	It's excess.
1751822	1752763	It's over the top.
1752924	1753605	It's stupid.
1753945	1755186	It's what a video game should be.
1755207	1755227	I...
1756988	1757669	I think it's great.
1757809	1760331	And there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheek humor in it.
1760731	1762813	There's references to other Sega games in it.
1763493	1769557	I love the fact that, and I'm not really spoiling too much because this is in the first two minutes of the game.
1769898	1773180	When they're kind of doing the credits, all the names of the people are on tombstones.
1773520	1775041	And then the director's name came up, right?
1775061	1776943	Same guy that did Devil May Cry and all that.
1777283	1779585	And it opens with somebody peeing on his grave.
1779605	1780025	Yeah.
1780545	1784309	What a good tongue-in-cheek, not-taking-yourself-seriously type of thing.
1784989	1789714	I had a lot of fun with the game, and many lulls were had, and I want to play more of it.
1790434	1797361	The only downside is that I didn't notice any type of multiplayer or how it really interfaced with live.
1797561	1800884	I guess there's leaderboards and stuff, but I had a really good time with it.
1802148	1806971	Actdeft in our chatroom, chat.orangesonsready.com says Bayonetta has rings like Sonic the Hedgehog rings.
1806991	1809313	They're called Halos, but yeah, they work just like the Sonic rings, really.
1809333	1811595	I totally see this as being like the diva of the Xbox game.
1831212	1832853	Well, keep in mind it's multi-platform.
1832973	1835014	They're on PS3 as well.
1835414	1836874	The diva of the game world then.
1837935	1840736	It would be a tragedy if there was no sequel announced to this game.
1841076	1844057	I really hope they do a sequel in the same vein.
1844337	1846018	And I'm not even that far into it.
1846058	1847439	I'm only a couple hours in.
1847859	1848999	I need to play more.
1849039	1850500	I just haven't had a lot of time this weekend.
1851100	1852341	Because I was playing another game.
1852881	1853682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1871303	1898321	I thought that this game, it's a game that there's kind of a lot of hype behind it, and I, including myself, I've hyped this game up before previously, I'm not sure the game lived up 100% to the hype, but there were certain things about it that I really liked, and there were certain parts of the game I was kind of like, oh, this is slow, get on with it, I'm not having any fun right now, let's get past this part, let's blow shit up and move on.
1899843	1901972	um... however
1903523	1906665	One other thing I want to say about it is that PC games, you know what?
1907606	1910148	They really have these demanding system requirements.
1910308	1914531	I was not able to play this game on my own computer, and my own computer is only like a year old.
1914991	1921296	I had to go play it on my boyfriend's computer because he has a better system than I do and a better video card and all that, and even still it was a little bit choppy.
1921717	1927021	However, I have to remember in a closed beta, sometimes these things are sending data to the server all the time.
1927061	1929363	It might be running a little bit slow on purpose, so I can't...
1929983	1930443	Thanks for watching!
1946084	1953136	Also, they've got to fix the interface in this particular game I'm thinking of because it's a game where you can chat with other players because that's the type of game it is.
1953817	1959105	And I couldn't stay on top of chat because the box is so freaking small, like no text fits in it at all.
1959546	1960568	So, there you go.
1962307	1964369	Anyhow, that was my thoughts on that.
1964409	1970633	More thoughts on that when the beta is unleashed to the public, which is happening next week, which is very good news.
1971214	1972635	All right, let's see.
1972895	1974816	That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.
1975377	1977118	Let's move on to a little bit of housekeeping news.
1977238	1979440	Okay, live listeners, I have a little bit of bad news, guys.
1980000	1985044	We're not going to be live for the next two weeks in our normal time slot, and it's really all my fault.
1985625	1986505	I apologize for that.
1987326	1990829	Next week is a three-day week for a lot of folks in America because of the Martin Luther King Jr.
1990849	1991189	holiday.
1991950	1996574	I'm actually taking a trip to Seattle, and I am not flying back until Monday, so I won't even be here at all that weekend.
1996594	1998915	So we will be taking next week off completely.
1999196	2001578	There will be no show next week at all.
2001798	2007663	There might be a best of that hits the feed if it's done in time, so stay tuned to our podcast feed.
2008783	2012306	However, the week after, on the 24th, again, I won't be here.
2012606	2014568	But that's just because I have Sunday evening plans.
2014608	2017590	And I'll admit, because it is a little bit gaming related, actually.
2017890	2020652	I'm going to see Utada Hikaru live at one of her shows.
2020692	2022554	She's in San Francisco on the 24th.
2022574	2024295	And I forgot it was a Sunday when I bought the tickets.
2024355	2028878	But, you know, what a rare opportunity to see a Japanese superstar in a small venue.
2028898	2030860	She's playing the Film War, which is not a very big venue at all.
2031200	2032881	So I'm going to go see that.
2033282	2036004	Sorry, I'm not going to apologize for it because I'm really looking forward to it.
2036644	2037264	We'll see you next time.
2052403	2053864	Greenwich Time Greenwich Time
2075524	2084530	Also, if you just want to get up early, if you happen to be up at 10 o'clock Pacific or that would only be about 1 in the afternoon Eastern, we will be doing a show that week and that will still go to the podcast feed as always.
2084930	2085630	So there you go.
2087972	2088432	Let's see.
2088972	2093375	Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.
2096837	2097317	Let's see.
2098740	2100301	Sorry, I apologize for the dead air.
2100321	2101801	I'm just trying to catch up on everything going on.
2101841	2106323	They're talking about the game because they all know what I'm talking about, but I don't want to say.
2106803	2115046	There's been previews of it everywhere, left and right, but it's just one of those things I would rather not without me knowing exactly what I can and can't say.
2116887	2132902	and it looks like that best of might be ready we just have to get our intros done for it so we'll see so anyway yes so no show next week at all won't be on the podcast feed or anything although there might be a best of which if it's a best of it's not going to be stuff you've heard in the past couple weeks it's going to be stuff from like
2133703	2136005	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2154238	2155319	All right, that's it for housekeeping.
2155360	2159805	Of course, Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lawns Radio.
2159885	2160446	Join us there.
2160746	2162168	Let's get into some gaming news.
2162468	2163870	Loki, what was some of the big news this week?
2164751	2166193	Well, there's lots of stuff this week.
2166213	2169016	We're going to start things off talking a little bit about
2169817	2197593	Microsoft's Game Room and basically I don't know if you would call this their answer to home I don't really know if it's that you may remember a while back we talked about a survey that went out that kind of talked about a place where you'd be able to walk your avatars around and play arcade games well that's what this is they're going to have a bunch of different arcade games some of the stuff they showed off were
2199918	2202940	I know that there was different Atari 2600 games on there.
2203340	2207002	They had other things including Centipede.
2207022	2212526	I'm trying to remember the other games that were on there that were pretty cool.
2215387	2218249	There's some television stuff too.
2218289	2219930	There's some Konami games on there.
2221551	2222512	All sorts of fun stuff.
2223172	2223512	Here we go.
2224413	2229476	Asteroids, Atari Football, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Outlaw.
2230548	2240871	Pitfall, Red Baron, Road Fighter, Scramble, Tempest, all the kind of stuff that you would... See, I picked up at least two games there that I've already bought on Xbox Live before.
2241191	2242111	Scramble and Tempest.
2242871	2248332	So what's going to be unique about this is you're going to be able to get your own gaming space basically in these areas.
2248372	2258115	You'll be able to customize little rooms with a different theme, what games you want in there, what other wall ornaments and whatnot you want to stick in there.
2258875	2258975	Um...
2260305	2261066	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2282547	2290473	Spend $3 or 240 Microsoft Points to get you a virtual arcade cabinet on one platform, either Xbox 360 or PC.
2290993	2292254	Probably the option I'll be going with.
2293275	2310728	And then also for people that want to just spend lots of money or just, I don't really know why you do this, but for the old retro type of 40 Microsoft Points or 50 cents will allow you to get you two quarters worth of playtime on select titles.
2311488	2314069	for the authentic arcade experience, they call it.
2314810	2325275	And the game room itself is actually being developed by the third-party studio Chrome Studios, who are behind Viva Pinata Party Animals, Star Wars Republic Heroes, among any other things.
2325856	2333179	They're planning on starting the service with 30 original arcade titles with 1,000 planned for the next three years.
2333920	2339403	And also, they're going to be available from a variety of publishers, including Atari, Activision, and Intellivision.
2340664	2341264	and Konami.
2341524	2346188	And apparently there's some more studios involved with it as well.
2346608	2349110	They're going to be presented in 1080p.
2351192	2352613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2370680	2371621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2387438	2388679	Thanks for watching!
2403854	2404434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2426274	2426714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2448143	2455048	A crappy netbook, a crappy PC from like 8 years ago will still run those ROMs just fine.
2456289	2461293	But no e-penis competition if you do it that way, because the whole leaderboards, medals, and all this stuff, right?
2461313	2461633	Who cares?
2461833	2462274	I don't know.
2462434	2463635	It doesn't matter.
2464435	2470180	See, I don't know if I'm really going to be into this, because, like I said, I have MAME.
2470560	2473242	So, why should I spend the money on this?
2473362	2475744	I mean, yeah, I get achievement points, but, you know...
2476892	2479775	I kind of got over that whole achievement point whoring stuff.
2480155	2487602	Because it's just, you know, the cost to buy games and stuff just to get achievement points, it's just not worth it.
2487844	2490225	Well, this is their way of legitimizing MAME, really.
2490365	2494347	I mean, they're trying to, you know... MAME is still not legal, folks.
2494527	2495687	You're not supposed to have it.
2495707	2496688	Let me put it this way, okay?
2497508	2500349	Here's one way at least they'll have a step up above home.
2501189	2503610	There's not going to be fucking lines for games.
2503750	2509593	I don't have to, like, you know, walk up to an arcade machine and go, Oh, I'm sorry, you can't play this game right now because there's other people playing it.
2510453	2512854	That's retarded when it comes to, you know...
2514090	2515491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2535049	2535489	I like it.
2535669	2538370	I mean, it'd be great to have on Xbox because I do go back and play old stuff.
2540030	2542351	I don't think I would necessarily do it as much on PC.
2542611	2549752	I mean, I think it's nice, especially for people who were into, you know, the classic gaming, like, what was that rental thing that you did, GameTap?
2550033	2551753	Yeah, GameTap, yeah.
2552253	2556034	You know, and I've pulled a few stuff off of Steam, like I play Loom, but that's really it.
2556587	2556807	DarkSakura,
2572783	2573604	Do some of the games.
2573664	2575105	I know they had Crystal Castles on there.
2575545	2576906	That's one of their launch games, yeah.
2577366	2581309	And see, the other thing too is that I have a lot of these games on the classic systems.
2581849	2583591	And I do have the right controllers for them.
2584171	2587393	And I admit it, not everyone's going to have everything.
2587433	2592337	Not everyone's got the vault or has been as nuts as Dan and I have been about collecting this stuff.
2593237	2599542	But me personally, I don't have a legitimate need to do the extra spending on it.
2599622	2599922	I don't.
2600522	2611896	and the other thing I think also too that people have been complaining about is like why should I pay $3 a game for these old Atari games when I could just get a flashback for like $20 and it's got like 40 games on there
2613012	2620994	There's also the community feature, I think, that has to be pointed out, is the fact that, you know, you set up your game room so that your friends can come kind of to your game room and play the games.
2621014	2625376	They haven't said, do they get to play them for free, or do they still have to pay, like, the quarters, or what's the deal?
2625396	2626316	Or are they playing demos?
2626356	2627636	Yeah, are they doing demos?
2627676	2628057	What's the deal?
2628077	2634899	I mean, they haven't really given us the details there, but there certainly is that whole idea of building up a collection, which is your game room, and kind of checking out what other people have.
2635319	2641040	And with a thousand planned games, I mean, there's certainly going to be that element of, oh, you have never played this game before?
2641100	2642361	Come to my game room and look at it real quick.
2642381	2642961	Know what they need to do?
2642961	2644062	Thanks for watching!
2662685	2664626	Why not have it so you can view the game as a spectator?
2664886	2665587	Think of it like this.
2665667	2668668	You're at the arcade and there's a bunch of people playing the same game that you want to play.
2668928	2671810	You look over their shoulders and watch the person in front play that game.
2672250	2678013	And GS68 says, yeah, watching someone kick ass at so-and-so game in person is better than watching a video on YouTube.
2678453	2679094	Game Room Game Room
2703097	2705479	I think there's still a lot to be determined, although we are getting some details.
2705739	2715828	You know, one of these videos, one of the guys that was hawking the game room says that the noises you hear in the background of the arcade is dynamically generated based on the games that are in your game room.
2717012	2721094	So, if you have joust, you'll hear joust noises as part of that.
2721254	2727277	Well, you know, actually, that idea was used in something else that Dan showed me before.
2727918	2737522	And I don't want to... I know it wasn't related to me in particular, but there's this guy who did a CG arcade and actually had gone around and recorded...
2738803	2751548	The games in action as well as the games, like their splash screens and that type of thing, their tracked modes, and then had them running so that as you moved through the CG version of this arcade, you were hearing things as you passed along, you know.
2752128	2754569	So I think that's going to be great.
2754649	2755609	I'm really going to like that.
2755709	2760011	Of course, I think that you should also have the option of turning them off, you know, because sometimes... Well, you might.
2760231	2760591	We don't know.
2760671	2762532	Usually they're not going to advertise, oh, and you can turn this off.
2763392	2764953	They don't really demo that, you know.
2765672	2768593	But back to it, I think that's a nice touch.
2769294	2770154	Some comments from our chatroom.
2770214	2774976	Actdeft says, Sky, you can play a game in the game room like a real arcade for 40 Microsoft points for one game.
2775356	2777597	I heard it was two games because it's two quarters.
2778038	2778498	But I don't know.
2779018	2780159	We'll see the specifics soon.
2782280	2784301	There's two different pricing methodologies.
2784621	2787002	If you think, oh, this is a game I'm only going to play once.
2787967	2789488	You can only spend 40 Microsoft points.
2789529	2789989	Play it once.
2790209	2790610	That's it.
2791270	2796595	I find that interesting pricing mechanic to be an interesting kind of change about this.
2797136	2801340	SJ100Matt says, Can we put a Microsoft Space Buck token on machines to play next?
2802341	2803542	I don't think you're going to have the line there.
2804042	2805764	It's going to be your own thing.
2806084	2813910	Here's my honest thought about Game Room, and I've kind of been processing this all week because, you know, as a classic gaming enthusiast, I am a little bit excited about Game Room.
2814251	2824659	Yes, I could do all this stuff on main, yeah, but I really like the community ideas, and I have friends that are going to be really into this, and I see myself having competitions for high scores on certain games in Game Room.
2824739	2825539	I see this happening.
2826380	2827121	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2844338	2845318	It's part of their business.
2845739	2848239	And the interesting thing about Game Room, guys, think about it.
2848639	2850840	This is not only a rip-off of Nintendo.
2851020	2851840	I shouldn't say rip-off.
2852160	2854641	It's not only inspired by Nintendo.
2854861	2855881	It's inspired by Sony.
2856181	2858742	Dude, this is virtual console and home.
2859362	2861943	This is Microsoft's way of one-upping both of those.
2862623	2865164	What has everybody been asking for for virtual console?
2865624	2868204	I should be able to play it online with my friends in like a two-player mode.
2868445	2868865	Guess what?
2869145	2869985	You can do that with Game Room.
2871317	2877902	I think the games in Virtual Console should have some HD effects and should have leaderboards in them and should have achievements.
2878002	2878342	Guess what?
2878382	2879623	Game Room's going to do that for these games.
2880784	2883005	I think Home should have a fucking point to it.
2883386	2890030	That I load up my games seamlessly through the Home interface or that if I earn things in games I'll be able to show it off.
2890251	2890691	Guess what?
2891171	2892052	Game Room's going to do that.
2893533	2901296	Game Room has kind of taken all these ideas that the community wanted from Virtual Console and the things that the community wanted from Home and put it into this Game Room.
2901717	2903077	I think it's kind of interesting.
2903597	2912982	Now, I don't think Game Room is as close to Home because I still think there's other stuff that Sony Home kind of will do and does that's much different than Game Room.
2913282	2915903	But I think Game Room is what we all thought Home would be.
2917256	2923538	In a way, even though yes is very important to point out, you're not going to be able to walk very fluidly through it.
2924738	2925358	No, so far.
2925518	2930980	That was just being what they were showing off at CES, they said, because they don't have the collision detection stuff worked out yet.
2931000	2938562	But if this thing is coming out in the spring, I don't see it suddenly... Well, spring for Microsoft is anywhere between, you know... Could be May, yeah.
2938762	2943944	It's basically, you know, April and May, so who knows.
2945583	2947585	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, Simpsons and X-Men Arcade!
2947945	2956353	I know you might be kind of messing around, but dude, imagine it if X-Men Arcade did show up in Game Room and you could play it online with six people.
2957033	2958895	I mean, that's going to be huge if that happens.
2960176	2962117	The Ninja Turtle games are pretty popular, right?
2962137	2964740	The Ninja Turtle Arcade game was one of Microsoft's best sellers.
2965040	2966962	Tons of people were playing that online, probably still are.
2968363	2971485	BlackWolf says, he's going so far as to say it'll come out during E3.
2972887	2973307	Possibly.
2974301	2976587	or like Daytona.
2977490	2980959	The racing controller and stuff like that.
2981946	2982146	All right.
2982386	2984929	So anyway, I guess more to see on Game Room.
2984949	2987491	But I'm excited at the possibilities.
2987511	2992555	Dude, as a classic gaming enthusiast, I don't mind that they're trying to legitimize MAME and give us a reason to pay for it.
2993096	2995538	And I would not buy every game.
2995618	2996058	Hell no.
2996399	3001003	But there are some games I remember quite fondly that, yeah, I might drop five bucks to play them on my PC.
3001223	3006808	Because when you say play it on my PC, I think, ooh, my laptop and everywhere it goes with me that I have an internet connection, which is when I travel.
3007228	3009109	That will be kind of cool to have on the road.
3009609	3012291	And compete in the leaderboards and the medals and all that.
3012311	3014452	And that's something I can't really do in MAME.
3015353	3016173	It's not that much.
3016713	3017814	Five bucks is not that much.
3020262	3021983	Anyhow, we'll see what happens.
3023004	3026045	Moving on to another classic game getting a redo.
3026126	3028147	Mega Man 10 is on its way.
3028587	3032469	And Mega Man 10, of course, they've been trying to keep the eight robot master names a secret.
3032509	3033049	But guess what?
3033089	3034870	The game is playable on the CES floor.
3034890	3038032	Well, I guess not on the floor, but maybe by appointment.
3038092	3039593	Either way, the game is showing at CES.
3039913	3043915	And although they are asking journalists not to name the bosses and not to show video of it...
3044655	3048679	I guess there was a German video that showed up that it accidentally snuck in there.
3049120	3052883	Probably they didn't intend to do it, but you know the bright-eyed fans found it.
3053384	3057027	And now the names of the boss monsters in Mega Man 10 have shown up.
3057287	3060310	So of course you already knew about Sheep Man, which I thought was kind of funny.
3060631	3069259	But you will also be able to fight Blade Man, Solar Man, Chill Man, Commando Man, Nitro Man, Strike Man, and Pump Man.
3070894	3074015	and when I hear Pump Man, I'm sorry, I think about the shoes, the pumps.
3074035	3074955	No female characters then?
3076056	3079176	Not yet, but keep in mind that's only eight, right?
3079196	3079737	That's eight.
3080537	3082998	Well, no, I guess there's only eight on the screen because I'm thinking nine.
3083338	3085438	So, no, it doesn't look like there's going to be a woman in this one.
3086459	3087419	Although anything can happen.
3088479	3091140	Maybe Dr. Wily is now, you know, to check.
3091604	3092044	Who knows?
3092364	3093165	Anything is possible.
3093605	3094566	No, I guess that's interesting.
3094586	3100249	Yeah, we had Splash Woman last time, which was the first female boss ever, and now no women this time, it sounds like.
3102530	3103310	I just like Pump Man.
3103330	3103611	I'm sorry.
3103631	3104471	It makes me think of the shoes.
3104691	3105312	It cracks me up.
3105332	3107793	I wonder if that's like a Dig Dug Pump Man or what the deal is there.
3109374	3112856	And Bobby Blackwolf says, Commando Man, he fights you with no underwear?
3112876	3112956	Yeah.
3114193	3115634	DarkSakura, what else is going on in gaming?
3143635	3147160	Well, the Greenpeace report came out.
3147461	3148963	You know how much stock I put in a lot of these.
3149003	3150986	Are those the people that tie themselves to boats and stuff?
3151226	3151627	Yes.
3151647	3152188	How fun.
3153650	3157936	But they have highlighted Nintendo as the most environmentally unfriendly.
3158897	3160058	of electronic companies.
3161959	3174889	They put out Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics and it scored 1.4 out of 10 for its chemical and energy and waste policies and was the lowest of all the ones that were done out of 18.
3175049	3186498	They had a zero on e-waste because they didn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions even though they promised that there's greenhouse gas emissions from a Wii game.
3187921	3192062	I think it's maybe some manufacturing release is what they're talking about.
3208827	3214569	It also got some points for the DSI-EC adapter and for disclosing CO2 emissions.
3216169	3217510	But yeah, it still got bad.
3217990	3221151	Microsoft got 2.4 points, so it was actually just above Nintendo.
3222051	3229173	And of the major three, Sony was the most green in seventh place with a score of 5.1.
3229213	3229453	Honestly...
3234875	3239537	Really the tops of the ones were Nokia, Sony Ericsson, and Toshiba.
3239657	3247220	And Apple got a big special mention for completely eliminating chemicals from the computer systems.
3248541	3252963	Honestly, I really don't care for Greenpeace as a facility all that much because...
3256391	3258453	of some inaccuracies in their own.
3259453	3262435	I'm not going to get on the political, socio-political platform right now.
3263476	3269240	People know there's a lot of stuff that I've said because they're just not accurate.
3269561	3272203	They try to put the spin on it for their own thing, but I'm not going to go into that.
3273503	3283511	I do, however, think that it's just a pretty interesting seeing where I think the concern is going, you know.
3283891	3283911	I
3284111	3287453	I'm all for being more green and environmentally friendly and all that.
3287493	3289514	You know, solar power, wind power, etc., etc.
3289654	3295837	And I do think, you know, one thing the study does show is that, hey, you know, if Microsoft... Even though they're not... If I remember right, I saw the chart.
3295897	3299820	Microsoft is by no means a green-friendly company, but they're higher up on the scale than Nintendo.
3300260	3300440	And if...
3300720	3301861	They can make some cutbacks.
3301901	3302982	I think, why can't Nintendo?
3303042	3305364	That's kind of like my thing is that they're both in the same business.
3305845	3308367	If Sony does really good, what changes?
3308627	3314993	I don't know the technical side of things so well, but what are they doing in the manufacturing that Nintendo and Microsoft can't do?
3315053	3317255	What can't they do?
3319577	3326543	I'm not going to go all hippie on you, but I'm all for looking for ways to be cost-effective yet green, you know?
3328048	3335251	Well, to be perfectly honest, I think people have gone way too overboard with the whole green thing because really I think a lot of it is probably going to get me some booze.
3335331	3349638	I really think a lot of it has to do with more ways to make money and more marketing, more ways of... I don't want to do the conspiracy thing and say that it's them trying to control the way we think.
3350038	3350598	You know what I mean?
3351179	3354280	But I think that it is a degree of social conditioning.
3354764	3360225	What's interesting, and I don't want to go too far with this because it's not about games, but a lot of people buy their video games there.
3360245	3360726	I will say this.
3361426	3367407	I heard a story on the news this week that Walmart in our area, Sacramento, at three test stores have eliminated plastic bags altogether.
3368007	3373069	And if you either bring your own bag or they will sell you the blue reusable bags for 15 cents.
3374789	3376650	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3393516	3400799	I would have a collection of those 15 cent bags piled up to the ceiling in my house because I would never remember to take them and I would end up throwing them away and shit.
3400859	3401259	You know what I mean?
3401279	3401860	Look at your feet.
3402160	3403480	I know, you've got a couple of them there.
3403620	3408463	But those I always empty out and I actually keep three or four of them in my car at any given point in time.
3409443	3415866	So I actually do use them, but honestly because I... I don't like throwing out the trash that often.
3416486	3416786	Really.
3417306	3418207	I mean, Dan do it, but...
3418976	3419817	I can't make you buy bags.
3439066	3440848	The grocery store, they do the reverse.
3440929	3442731	If you bring your own bag, they take off five cents.
3443011	3445113	Also, Ikea's like a pompous store, too.
3445133	3452662	All high and mighty, smelling their own farts, as South Park could put it.
3454384	3458128	Seriously, they have a bunch of shit there that's way too damn expensive.
3458516	3460239	Lord Moon in our chat says, put them in your car.
3460279	3461221	Just remember they're in your car.
3461261	3464788	You know, in theory, that's a really good idea, but yet I still see myself failing.
3464888	3465830	Here's what I'm going to do instead.
3465890	3467233	I'm not going to go shop at Walmart.
3467353	3468535	At least not that Walmart.
3469193	3470254	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3490034	3492278	because I don't always take the same classes every day.
3492318	3500975	I mean, I'm going to have overlap this semester, but when they're all in my car, I just grab the bag I need and go and I don't have to worry about changing out my books or anything.
3501583	3503625	I actually reuse the plastic bags.
3503665	3506166	I'll take my lunches to work and I don't have a fancy thermos or nothing.
3506186	3507767	I don't need all that fancy shit.
3507787	3509208	I put it in a plastic bag and take it to work.
3509609	3514552	Or even if I'm taking bathroom supplies on a trip with me for travel, I'll put it in a plastic bag.
3514572	3515993	It's stuff for the bathroom.
3516273	3518255	It doesn't need to be in a fancy plush case.
3518415	3522858	The other thing I use plastic bags for is when I dye my hair because I tend to splash everywhere.
3523038	3525421	and a lot of people line the kitty liner with it.
3526162	3529126	I get cat bag liners because Shermie has a big box for her stinky ass.
3530208	3537618	But I actually line my sink with plastic bags so that I don't stain the sink since this technically isn't really our house.
3538972	3543154	I wanted to go back and read some of the comments on Mega Man 10 because there was some funny stuff in chat.
3543575	3548057	And I think Bochikawa hit the nail on the head earlier in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com.
3548417	3550759	I think pump means like water pump.
3551219	3556282	And that's actually not a bad guess because usually there's some type of water boss in the game and that's probably the one that's good.
3556602	3557802	I like TigerClaw's comment too.
3557902	3559944	Pump could mean the first robot could be muscle bound.
3560284	3561925	At least they didn't call him Plump Man.
3562725	3567648	GS68 says, if there ever is a final Mega Man game, the last boss should simply be called The Man.
3569137	3578507	LOL, last Mega Man game, you're funny Jay Dizzle commenting on this story says they have to disclose CO2 emissions so I can't fart without telling my supervisor
3583758	3585178	One other thing, and I do have to bring this up.
3585999	3591840	We actually do need a certain degree of CO2 in the air for environmental balance.
3592160	3595121	And I think that people tend to take it a little bit too far.
3595861	3596882	I mean, I understand.
3597522	3598762	Yeah, we need to cut back on stuff.
3598782	3602123	There's certain things that are going on environmentally that, yeah, we do have to be more mindful of.
3602163	3605084	But I really do think that people are taking it way too far.
3605864	3610806	They're reading more into things and making, certainly, a catastrophe out of something that really isn't.
3612026	3612226	You know?
3613146	3613426	All right.
3613847	3616970	We've got more gaming news in our Classic Game of the Week before too long here.
3617090	3617330	Loki.
3617810	3618771	Yeah.
3618871	3630422	Well, if you have some EA games that are a tad bit old and dusty, you may not be able to play those online soon enough because they are going to be shutting down some of their older game servers.
3631483	3636628	And some of the games that they have, actually, some of the games on the list aren't too old.
3636648	3637249	Right.
3638632	3644814	For example, Facebreaker, which came out about a year ago, is being shut down.
3645414	3650396	Some other ones on the list, Madden 08 and Madden 09.
3650436	3652097	08 is being shut down.
3652297	3655578	These are on February 2nd on the Wii and PC.
3656158	3661140	And 09 on the original Xbox, Wii and on PSP.
3663079	3666180	Also, some other older sports games.
3666381	3676064	March Madness 07, NBA Live 07, 08, 09, at least on the Wii, and that's in Europe only.
3677605	3679626	NCAA Football, NASCAR.
3680746	3687249	NASCAR 09 I'm kind of surprised on because they actually don't have a new NASCAR game, so that's interesting.
3687949	3689270	That is only on PS2.
3689370	3691411	PS3 and Xbox 360, though, in Europe only.
3693646	3694787	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3720611	3723415	I'm not too surprised, but maybe some people are.
3723595	3726720	But hell, buy Madden 09 or something.
3726740	3727962	I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.
3728883	3734191	And a few Tiger Woods games also.
3734773	3740155	Well, it's always kind of sad when they shut servers down, but at the same time, you know, I get it with the sports games.
3740215	3741235	Most of those folks upgrade.
3741536	3742976	They're just not cost-effective to run.
3743116	3743656	You know what I mean?
3743976	3744197	Yes.
3745817	3750059	Another game also, not exactly an EA game, that's also having their servers shut down.
3750419	3760683	In fact, actually shutting down, I don't know if it's already happened already, but Chromehounds, apparently, the servers shut down.
3761621	3765402	Yeah, I can see why that game really got boring really fast.
3766342	3774984	And apparently, this happened way back... Oh, apparently this week is when it actually shut down.
3775044	3781525	Apparently they announced the shutdown back in August, but they finally shut the servers off this week.
3783285	3783966	That's too bad.
3784966	3786086	But, eh.
3786704	3787845	We have Armored Core now.
3788185	3794670	And we're going to be having, soon enough, the new Front Mission game, which is going to be all sorts of awesome.
3796871	3800754	Bobby in chat, because you might remember Bobby was talking about Chromehounds a lot when that game first came out.
3800794	3802275	He said, Chromehounds shut down last week.
3802676	3804757	All my friends did one last hurrah last weekend.
3804797	3805397	I wasn't home.
3808052	3811033	Well, it's always sad when the games that you like, their servers shut down.
3811194	3813515	I remember when the Amplitude servers shut down, I had to cry.
3814315	3819778	I wonder if Chromehounds was System Link as well, because that might not be so bad.
3819818	3821659	At least you could do LAN or something like that.
3823259	3830143	They don't really have a lot of System Link games anymore anyways, but I wonder if that was one of them that was.
3830263	3834185	Well, that's probably kind of a pain in the ass to do, too, the whole System Link thing, you know?
3835151	3842419	Well, there's people that like doing LAN stuff, and I mean, yeah, it may be a pain in the ass, but I don't know.
3842459	3844421	That'd be kind of neat, though, if it was System Link.
3846703	3847324	And it's not.
3849006	3849226	Bummer.
3850973	3860876	Alright, some more news for you guys, and this has to do with another thing getting shut down, but not quite an actually authorized video game.
3861356	3866678	No, Nintendo has put the smackdown on a fan film that was being made for quite some time, actually.
3866698	3876641	I guess this film had been taken like four years to make, but considering there was a bunch of people that did it in their free time, the Zelda movie was called The Hero of Time, and they actually put it out on the internet.
3877161	3879482	It got some mixed reviews, but you know, I mean...
3880410	3881430	It was a fan thing.
3881470	3886533	I wouldn't expect anything that's Hollywood-caliber stuff.
3886593	3890434	Folks were at least kind of appreciative that the movie, I guess, had been made.
3890814	3904040	But not Nintendo, because the movie's official site on New Year's Day... Actually, so this is a little bit over a week old, but the community site actually had to take the movie down because the studio came to an agreement with Nintendo.
3905260	3906662	They actually say, quote, So, uh, yeah.
3906742	3907763	They won't be making a movie out of that.
3907783	3907983	You know...
3927961	3929365	I get why they had to do it.
3936041	3941204	because unfortunately not everyone might think that this is a unauthorized movie.
3941245	3946148	Because think about how that whole game of telephone works, especially so on the internet.
3946508	3948389	One thing gets passed along to another person.
3948689	3951331	Somebody's going to say, hey dude, have you seen the Zelda movie?
3951371	3952092	Let me hand this to you.
3952132	3953873	This is the fucking Legend of Zelda movie.
3954093	3955254	And then it's not good.
3955394	3963339	And if they don't protect their actual trademarks, then they will no longer have those trademarks, basically.
3963379	3964340	Because if, you know,
3964738	3965782	Thank you for watching!
3969360	3973823	The other thing, though, to kind of go with that, though, is it's already on YouTube, of course, in parts.
3974143	3979547	The thing, once they hit the internet, though, that's the other side of it, is that once something hits the internet, it's done.
3979787	3985771	I mean, there's no, like, it's not like you can say, oh, well, now nobody will ever see this.
3986171	3990053	Nope, once it hits the internet, it is a, it's done.
3990113	3991794	Everybody has it if they want to know where to go look.
3992095	3992935	And yeah, it's on YouTube.
3992975	3998219	Tigerclaw just linked us to it in our chat room, and you can actually see we're playing, like, just a little clip here.
3998239	3998899	And I watched the first
3999339	4013935	and it's kind of boring is it let's just look at a little bit here I don't know some chicks crying in the forest I don't know if that's Zelda oh maybe that's supposed to be like Link when he's born or something
4017014	4020997	I mean, it looks like something that would have been on TV in the 1980s.
4021498	4027443	I was going to say, it has the same kind of production quality as Highlander.
4027543	4029284	It looks like Beauty and the Beast to me.
4032587	4037171	You remember that old-ass show, Beauty and the Beast, with what's-her-name, that went on to be in The Terminator?
4037191	4037691	Linda Hamilton.
4037731	4038832	That's it, Linda Hamilton.
4039493	4040794	Dude, I love that show, by the way.
4042102	4042802	Anyhow, sorry.
4043162	4044503	I guess that was a little prologue there.
4045243	4047423	Yeah, it's all over YouTube, so take a look if you want.
4047903	4050784	Anyway, release date's coming up after another story from DarkSakura.
4053324	4055405	She doesn't drop all her stuff everywhere.
4055425	4055825	You alright?
4056285	4056905	Can you continue?
4057325	4058605	Is this a workman's comp issue?
4060726	4062366	There are four letters I'd like to say to you.
4063786	4064166	Hello?
4064407	4065307	Oh wait, no, too many.
4065327	4066047	S-T-F-U.
4068214	4069795	And that's with all the love in my heart.
4071216	4075840	Well, EA actually has hired somebody, so not everyone's losing their job.
4077361	4078402	They hired Mark Tramiel.
4078882	4080103	You know what Mark Tramiel gave us?
4081144	4082024	NBA Jam!
4083245	4084847	Boom shakalaka!
4086468	4095454	So basically, since they're trying to revive NBA Jam for Wii, why not hire the guy who made it?
4096400	4100603	I wonder if I can still play as Bill Clinton.
4126882	4128443	or, you know, Liu Kang.
4130325	4134127	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some upcoming video games.
4134247	4138290	NBA Jam, I don't think is one of them yet, but I bet you that's an E3 title.
4139071	4140211	That's something we'll see at E3.
4140271	4140612	We'll see.
4141853	4143053	Yep.
4143694	4146296	Well, this week we actually have some decent stuff coming out.
4146836	4149178	Starting off with Army of Two, the 40th day.
4149578	4151819	Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and on PSP.
4155270	4157592	The PSP one is supposed to be more like Contra, so that's kind of cool.
4158533	4162477	Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.
4163037	4164138	That's a long-ass title.
4165059	4169083	Coming out on Xbox 360 and also on PS3 as well.
4170004	4174068	Skycrawler's Innocent Aces on the Wii, coming from XSEED.
4175723	4179127	We've got a Sims 2 re-release collection.
4179547	4184933	The Sims 2 Fun with Pets collection, which includes three of the expansions.
4186254	4187816	You said Sims 2 Fun with Pets?
4188256	4189697	Sims 2 Fun with Pets.
4189758	4190939	Even though Sims 3 is out now.
4191599	4193862	It's just a compilation.
4193882	4196925	Can you torture the pets in the same way that you torture humans?
4197185	4203567	Well, it's got Sims 2 Pets and Sims 2 Family Fun and Sims 2 Not that I would ever do that.
4203847	4205848	I want Pets and Sims 3.
4205948	4206548	I'm waiting for it.
4206568	4208189	I just want to present all sides of the issue.
4208529	4217592	Yeah, it's the Sims 2 Pets, Sims 2 H&M Family Fun stuff and Sims 2 Mansion and Garden stuff.
4218032	4218592	So you can get that.
4218612	4221493	There's actually another Sims 3 expansion coming in March.
4222974	4224775	I don't remember what it's called, though, unfortunately.
4224795	4225735	Um...
4227651	4234434	Daniel X coming out on the DS, which I think that's based off a movie or TV show.
4234454	4235014	I can't remember.
4236595	4238096	Twin Sector on the PC.
4239596	4244038	Sands of Destruction coming out from Sega, and that's on the DS.
4244219	4245179	Pretty cool role-playing game.
4247557	4250758	God, why do you let me down Konami?
4252199	4257301	Their brand new music rhythm game, which is crap, called Walk It Out.
4257581	4260142	Yes, it's a game for the Wii about walking.
4261723	4266405	Awesome, because this is way better than any other good music game they could possibly release.
4266485	4268705	Let's release another one that's about walking.
4271227	4276689	And finally, a week from today, Glory of Hercules coming out on the Nintendo DS from Nintendo.
4277796	4278698	Let's Push The Power Button
4287904	4289805	Or bobbing your head to the music.
4290685	4291585	What is love?
4292106	4293206	Baby, don't hurt me.
4293686	4296307	Hey, going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.
4296367	4299488	Batman Arkham Asylum, yes, it's taken a little while to come to Japan.
4299528	4301949	But of course, they're probably having to re-dub everything in Japanese.
4301969	4306151	So that is getting its release this week on the Xbox 360 and I believe the PlayStation 3 as well.
4306871	4310652	Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising also making its way to the Xbox 360 and the PS3.
4312993	4315536	The PS3 is getting a price reduction on Bioshock.
4315576	4319079	It's taken them a little while, but that would be the Japanese localized version there.
4319500	4320340	That's coming out there.
4320921	4323964	On the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard, The Darkside Chronicles.
4324164	4326386	And that, of course, would be Resident Evil over here in the U.S.
4326827	4331151	So that would be Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles making its way out on the Wii this week in Japan.
4331831	4333552	Nothing of note, really, on the PlayStation 2.
4333953	4336214	On the DS, there's a game called Last Window.
4336574	4340237	Mayonaka no Yakusoku comes out this week on the DS.
4340297	4341598	I'm trying to see what kind of game that is.
4342959	4344380	It's by Nintendo.
4344440	4346161	It's some type of first-party game.
4346681	4349743	It looks to be kind of like one of those investigative games, mystery-type things.
4349803	4351785	It's the sequel to Hotel...
4352345	4354086	Dust, I think.
4354106	4355406	Oh, it does look like that.
4355927	4356487	That's what it is.
4356547	4357767	Last Window, that would make sense.
4357907	4359528	Okay, so it's like a sequel to that in Japan.
4359548	4363750	I know part of the name is Promise, so I don't understand the rest of it.
4363770	4365790	That could have to do with the story, so that makes sense.
4366251	4366951	All right, very cool.
4367971	4371353	Also coming out, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.
4372033	4374154	I don't know if they're having the same busy first quarter we are.
4375054	4377196	On the Sony PSP it's got a few things.
4377496	4380157	Tekken 6 is getting a release on the PSP in Japan this week.
4380538	4383339	Spectral vs. Generation gets a price reduction this week.
4383720	4390003	And Kentoshi Gladiator Begins is a game that's coming out from the company Acquire.
4390704	4394526	And it looks to be, you know, it's got kind of the gladiator on the front.
4394586	4401270	It does look like it's kind of a gladiator Roman times and all that inspired game, like a fighting game.
4401310	4401610	Kind of...
4402691	4409794	A little bit God of War-ish, but a little bit closer in the camera and a little bit closer combat, it looks like, from the screenshots we're looking at.
4410254	4412015	I don't know if that's something they're planning on bringing over here.
4413135	4417437	Oh, by the way, if you do like Bleach, Soul Carnival gets a price reduction on the PSP this week as well.
4417697	4418958	That does it for Japanese releases.
4418998	4419418	How about the UK?
4419977	4421317	For the UK, I've just got a few.
4421838	4427240	We have Army of Two, The 40th Day on Xbox 360 and PS3 and PSP.
4427680	4430121	We have Astro Boy for Wii DS and PSP.
4430361	4436143	Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games on PS3, PC and Xbox 360.
4436183	4436443	That's it.
4438325	4452642	Looking at some of the comments in our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com Some people getting in on the walk it out fun Bochikawa says, I want to see clap fun on the Wii GameGuru says, Konami's press start to win Where you press start and you win
4453448	4454409	Thank you for watching!
4470382	4477031	A co-worker of mine, I don't know a lot of hardcore gamers at work, although this guy in particular does play a lot of video games.
4477371	4480515	He told me that just dance on the Wii is actually a lot of fun.
4480916	4483059	And some of the OLR people have said that too.
4483519	4486003	It's a horrible game, but I've been selling a ton of it.
4486283	4486883	I still want X-Tango
4514447	4517788	And of course, Tigerclaw takes things straight to the toilet saying, how about Jack it out?
4519528	4521349	Of course he means a jack-in-the-box, right?
4521549	4522209	Turn the crank?
4523229	4524069	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
4524109	4524789	No, that's not what he means.
4525189	4529670	He means turning the crank, but not the kind of... Anyhow, how about more gaming news?
4530430	4533771	Actually, I have a better name for that particular version of it.
4533891	4534151	Please.
4534291	4537952	It'd be... Ceiling Cat is watching you play this game.
4539752	4541393	They should really just call it Walk It Off.
4541433	4542033	It'd be Fap to Win.
4543220	4545289	They should just call it Walk It Off.
4545370	4548022	Someone gets brutally injured and they have to walk it off.
4549142	4552823	Amalthea also chimes in and says, why don't they transfer the Taiko drum games to the Wii?
4552843	4553403	It would be perfect.
4553783	4554503	I believe they did.
4554543	4556844	They have a little inflatable drum, even, but it's in Japan.
4556964	4557824	They didn't bring it over here.
4558244	4564286	So you might have to write Namco and bug them, or you're probably going to have to mod your Wii and import the Japanese version.
4564306	4566506	But yeah, there's a cute little inflatable drum and everything.
4567386	4569867	But those games, if I remember right, are pretty heavily Japanese.
4570267	4572247	Like, you know, they're not translated into English.
4572347	4573348	So, yeah.
4574208	4574988	Good luck navigating it.
4576821	4579562	Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4580103	4584685	And it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what DarkSakura has picked this week, but it's a good one, nonetheless.
4585766	4594511	Alright, well, there's some news coming about what may be announced at E3, perhaps, this year.
4595752	4602536	Satoru Iwata has offered some information regarding the next DS system.
4603556	4609058	And this is the next, not necessarily next, revision of the system.
4609838	4621501	They're saying that the true next Nintendo handheld system, this is from an interview with a Asahi Shimbun newspaper, I'm assuming in Japan.
4621922	4624882	It says it will have highly detailed graphics and it will be...
4626923	4633486	A necessity to have a sensor with the ability to read movements of people playing.
4633526	4636748	In other words, going to have a tilt sensor sort of like the iPhone.
4639369	4645953	And I guess they also have done some experiments with motion control gaming and stuff on the DS.
4647593	4648694	Well, neat.
4649774	4653816	Then also another rumor that's still going around is some sort of...
4655977	4657939	3G-like service for the DS.
4658899	4668907	And something that they're going to have like DS Wi-Fi hotspots or something like that that you're going to be able to connect with people or download content or something like that.
4669427	4677953	Also, they said there's going to be a new Zelda game sort of revealed, I guess, revealed this year at E3.
4678394	4680515	I guess it was sort of revealed last year, but...
4681596	4682076	and DarkSakura.
4705450	4709675	There's actually been some demos put out by Engine Software.
4709735	4712198	It's a studio that develops different games.
4712638	4721148	They have a demo of a game called Tilt that kind of looks a little bit like Marble Blast Ultra or like Monkey Ball or something like that.
4721608	4738326	and it does tilt sensors or I guess motion control based on the camera because you remember the DSi has a camera built into it and can detect movement so you can basically do that it acts like tilting the actual system
4741307	4741947	Thanks for watching!
4759268	4760729	I don't know what to call it.
4760770	4761510	Drivers, I guess.
4761550	4772039	The libraries for this technology, this company has it available for, I guess this is working on a DSiWare game that's going to incorporate this new technology.
4772940	4775722	That'd be cool to see, but I don't know.
4775822	4778324	Do we really need motion sensors with a portable system?
4778565	4779605	I don't know if that's the case.
4779866	4783008	I can understand it with the iPhone because there's no actual buttons on it.
4783168	4785010	I mean, so how else are you going to control stuff?
4787092	4787292	But
4788755	4790775	I don't know, maybe we'll see the buttons go away.
4790795	4792116	That'd be kind of crappy, though.
4794916	4795236	All right.
4795516	4800257	It's very interesting, though, that there's a new DS kind of definitely in the works, it sounds like, for E3.
4800297	4802758	Like, that could be their big announcement this year is that, hey, new DS.
4802938	4807119	Wouldn't that piss everybody off because now they have this DS XL or whatever?
4807139	4807799	But not in America.
4808059	4808399	Not in America.
4808419	4809999	Maybe they don't plan on bringing it here because of that.
4810019	4812440	But they just brought out the DSi, what, a year ago?
4812700	4812960	I know.
4814216	4815037	You know what though?
4815077	4815878	Hey, you know what though?
4816059	4818521	You can't... Apple puts out a new phone every year.
4819082	4820664	I mean, is that different?
4820704	4821024	I don't know.
4821665	4823808	Yeah, but that's just the specs slightly upgraded.
4823828	4825830	This is going to be a whole new system.
4826431	4826771	I don't know.
4826931	4827052	It's...
4828587	4828927	Stop.
4829248	4830929	Just make some good games for it.
4831810	4835354	Have you really utilized this new technology and all these different upgrades yet?
4836214	4837756	Have they really done anything with the cameras?
4837876	4839518	Hey, look, now you can put your face in this.
4840018	4840419	Oh, wow.
4840719	4841820	Awesome.
4841980	4844643	Actually, Nintendo hasn't really done anything with the camera.
4844763	4851629	DSi needs an app like the unicorn thing on the iPhone where you can take pictures of people and turn them into unicorns.
4852330	4853351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4876414	4877595	and then they move on to something else.
4877655	4879556	But they haven't even really done anything with it.
4879636	4882117	It's like the IR port in the PSP is completely useless.
4882578	4885919	I'd just be perfectly happy if they had a built-in Mario Paint mode.
4887320	4888441	Alright, we've got to keep the show moving.
4888461	4896185	I do want to say real quick though, Giovedea in chat had a really good suggestion for the game's name that was inspired by Tigerclaw, you know, the whole turn-in-the-crank game.
4896466	4897966	She says they ought to just call it Beat It!
4898627	4900348	And you could already have some soundtrack in it.
4906247	4907094	Aw yeah, this game's hot.
4909949	4911309	I just scarred all of our listeners.
4911850	4915671	Alright, hey, one other music game that might be for real, for serious.
4915751	4916151	No, really.
4916891	4918651	Def Leppard, the game.
4919252	4921312	Apparently it's coming from a Reuters report.
4921392	4924113	Reuters being one of the big news agencies with Associated Press, of course.
4924733	4932775	Apparently the publishing company Primary Wave made a deal with Def Leppard to make a cartoon series and a video game that will be based on the band.
4933076	4935516	The video game project is being called Unusual.
4936357	4937117	Don't know what that means.
4937817	4937877	Uh...
4939505	4940706	But that's just all a rumor right now.
4940746	4945211	So it's not some type of Def Leppard rock band or anything like that.
4945271	4946873	Perhaps Revolution Def?
4947974	4948074	Eh?
4948495	4948595	Eh?
4948975	4949836	Sequel, maybe?
4950037	4950317	Yes?
4950797	4951598	It's unusual.
4951778	4952699	That would be unusual.
4953604	4953944	Elvish
4982500	4984941	might, you know, be big enough.
4985041	4986521	Or U2, I think, was a really good idea.
4986661	4987982	I think U2 could get their own game.
4988002	4990362	If it was an Elvis game, though, you'd have to have sensors on your hips.
4993263	4996004	I kind of want to see the focus away from these band-specific music games.
4996364	4997904	It's getting to be a little much.
4998024	5000585	Like Van Halen, let's face it, was not that great.
5000705	5003045	It's an excuse to release another game.
5003205	5003325	I know.
5003345	5005046	That's really what it is, because you can sell extra copies.
5006206	5012128	Let's keep in mind, back it up a minute because keep in mind, this Def Leppard thing has nothing to do with Harmonix or Activision.
5012168	5012929	It's another company.
5013209	5015910	So if there is a music game coming out, it's different.
5016570	5017490	That could be anything.
5018771	5019331	I don't know though.
5019431	5020692	I think it's all talk.
5020892	5021572	I don't think it'll happen.
5022918	5025921	I think if they do the test marketing and sampling, they're going to find there's not enough interest for it.
5025941	5040814	And why would Def Leppard say, you know, oh, let's go with another company for a music game instead of jumping on an established franchise where they would get the marketing support and the popularity from the rock band or guitar hero franchises.
5041294	5045238	I just don't get why they would just go, eh, whatever, we don't need all that stuff.
5045518	5046379	We're Def Leppard.
5047718	5049119	I did like their last album.
5050260	5053122	Yeah, but I don't think it's like sold platinum copies, you know?
5053202	5056144	They're kind of more of a nostalgia band at this point.
5056164	5056625	This is, though?
5057585	5059046	Bon Jovi's new album?
5059126	5059727	It was a gift.
5060007	5060828	I don't like Bon Jovi.
5061068	5061828	Dude, I love Bon Jovi.
5062349	5062909	Alright, anyhow.
5063289	5074257	This is the part of the show, speaking of blasts from the past, where we like to open up the vault and take a trip down memory lane and, you know, respect the classics with a little segment we do here on OLR called the Classic Game of the Week.
5074617	5085827	DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she says, you know what, you kids today that don't listen to your Def Leppard and Bon Jovi like you should, you need to go back and look at this classic game from the past.
5086027	5087929	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
5088189	5089790	The classic game is NBA Jam.
5090551	5090971	Of course.
5091692	5098177	And because there is no actual music really played much in the game while you're playing, I just found arcade samples.
5099939	5100099	So...
5104639	5105900	Boom Shakalaka!
5106341	5106761	Yeah.
5107402	5108223	He's on fire!
5109083	5115770	Anyway, NBA Jam came out in 1993 for the arcade, and it spawned a series.
5116470	5117832	And actually, it was written in assembly.
5118853	5123737	And of course, as I said in an earlier story, it was designed and programmed by Mark Turmel.
5125866	5143842	Um, it used, um, a lot of the big names from the 92, 93 NBA system, and then, um, of course for the console releases, it used the 93, 94, um, and there have been, uh, later versions that came out on Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear.
5145023	5145123	Um...
5147054	5163463	so but of course there were certain um licensing things like they couldn't get Michael Jordan for um the Bulls at the time so um they did get Scottie Pippen at the time they also got um certain ones were missing from the home versions like Gary Payton and Shaquille O'Neal um
5166357	5171678	There's also, of course, as we mentioned, a possibility of it being out on Wii.
5172518	5175479	Some of the pretty cool stuff, though, is this game.
5176179	5187242	What I think is really the notable part of it is that the games had their digitized likenesses of the players included in the games so that you could see their faces while they played.
5188042	5191425	Um, and then if you got three baskets in a row, you were on fire.
5192006	5197731	And, uh, so, uh, you could, you know, be unlimited turbo, no goaltending.
5198091	5201354	Um, you could shoot better until the other team scored.
5202775	5202835	Um...
5206269	5211812	Also, you know, you didn't have fouls, free throws, that type of thing.
5212552	5215634	And you've got your spectacular dunk shots.
5215894	5218616	So it was really more of a fantasy basketball type game.
5219836	5234224	As far as Easter eggs that were in the game, you could... Like, the Genesis actually had one, and I remember this one, Super Clean Floors, where if you run too fast, you could slide and fall.
5235925	5238627	and then there were the hidden characters like you could play as Bill Clinton.
5240228	5242329	You could play the Charlotte Hornets mascot.
5244170	5251955	And then there were early versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition that let you play as Mortal Kombat characters.
5253396	5260460	And I actually remembered playing beta versions of the game.
5261221	5263302	By the way, you should play the Tournament Edition one that I linked up.
5263678	5267563	Oh, um, okay, I just keep hopping from music to music.
5267883	5268364	That one's fine.
5268764	5269024	Okay.
5269124	5272749	I like the Tournament Edition halftime music that I linked up in...
5273930	5274771	Um, I'll get it.
5275031	5282734	Okay, but anyway, they actually were taken out because of the violence the Mortal Kombat characters represented.
5283734	5286895	However, like I said, I played beta versions of it that everyone was in.
5287416	5294578	You know, there were a lot of... For NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat 2, there were a lot of...
5296299	5299622	and beta versions of the games on the East Coast.
5299962	5301883	So I got to check those out at the time.
5301903	5304105	It was that year I went to New York.
5304766	5306006	So I got to see them a lot on the way up the East Coast.
5306026	5307287	It was pretty cool.
5308668	5320978	So yeah, just to go over some of the people in the arcade version, you had Shaquille O'Neal, you had Isaiah Thomas, you had Reggie Miller, Harvey Grant.
5322098	5323700	For the SNES Genesis one...
5324480	5327726	like some of the other people in there were Alonzo Warnings, Scottie Pippen
5330003	5348796	Patrick Ewing, Sega CD, you had a lot of the same people, just newer updates to them, and then of course you had the Game Gear ones, so really a lot of the same people, although there were a few that for licensing issues were out.
5350997	5357641	You also, you know, you had Charles Barkley, you had just all the big people, you know, for
5359827	5361909	I don't know if anyone kept up with basketball back then.
5362009	5362649	I actually did.
5362669	5366032	So it was pretty cool.
5366192	5367793	There were sequels.
5368954	5371196	There was an NBA Jam Tournament Edition.
5372557	5375299	There were all kinds of different ports.
5377380	5380663	There was actually even an Atari Jaguar version of it.
5381464	5387768	There was NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, which was a 3D version that had Marv Albert doing the commentary.
5391522	5401161	There was... It actually was revised as NBA Hangtime.
5401541	5402143	Do you remember that one?
5403160	5403420	I do.
5403440	5405281	Wasn't the same.
5405541	5408083	There was a college version that's called College Slam.
5409323	5415946	And then there were, of course, all the other sports games that Midway did.
5416127	5419048	They did a two-on-two open ice challenge.
5420409	5424531	But then it came out as Wayne Gretzky 3D hockey and NFL Blitz.
5425691	5427792	Blitz, I think, was another one in the thing.
5427872	5431494	And then I think more of a spiritual successor, though, at NBA Jam was the NBA Showtime
5433215	5435376	Hey Jamie, what did you have for breakfast today?
5435396	5435876	I didn't.
5459656	5460176	That's cool.
5460837	5463419	Is there, uh, the, uh, it's in the shoes?
5463679	5464360	Or is it the shoes?
5466282	5466942	Oh my!
5467062	5467983	He's on fire!
5468544	5468704	No.
5470165	5471146	I'm out of town!
5471806	5474809	Actually, one of my favorite ones was, um, Couldn't Buy a Bucket.
5475590	5476390	Heating up!
5478012	5478813	Ugly shot!
5479233	5479593	Yeah.
5482255	5483196	Fantastic!
5483577	5487300	Alright, I'll cut it out, but I just... I thought that you'd get a kick out of Marv Albert being...
5489286	5490907	That's kind of funny.
5490927	5496010	I'm not a big, big fan of sports games usually.
5496510	5497711	I don't watch a lot.
5498472	5499672	But I loved NBA Jam.
5499912	5501413	I played the crap out of that game.
5501814	5503835	And if I do watch any sports, it's probably basketball.
5504015	5505116	It's the one I like more than anything.
5506609	5510692	Anyhow, we've got plenty more gaming news coming up later in the show here.
5510712	5513054	We're going to take a quick break, though, for our live folks.
5513574	5515456	For you podcast folks, just sit on tight.
5515476	5516977	We'll be right back after a little interlude.
5517277	5520860	But when we come back after the break, we've got a lot of rapid-fire news tonight.
5520880	5521420	Some quick stuff.
5521440	5522181	Your Twitter topics.
5522821	5525343	We're going to talk a little bit about some Blizzard rumors.
5525703	5528065	A game that apparently is no longer being published or shipped.
5528545	5530727	A Wii Wand with MotionPlus built in.
5531187	5532188	And plenty more when we come back.
5533311	5533972	from a quick break.
5534032	5534493	Excuse me.
5535054	5535534	We're live.
5535615	5536236	I have the hiccups.
5536276	5536836	I can't handle it.
5537137	5538579	Alright, so I'm glad we're taking a break right now.
5538860	5542685	So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5548695	5549216	Orange Lounge Radio
5567515	5567956	and DarkSakura.com.
5590057	5596361	Yes, Dragon Age Origins is getting a brand new expansion in March.
5597421	5601644	The new expansion is called Awakening, and it'll be coming out March 16th.
5601904	5607087	It's going to be the first retail expansion for Dragon Age Origins.
5607587	5611329	Apparently, it's going to be available for $40.
5611750	5614351	I'm not sure if that's actually coming out.
5614451	5616392	I think that's also on $360 as well.
5616732	5618153	Damn, that's kind of expensive. $40? !
5620555	5621235	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5646240	5648861	Left 4 Dead is kind of getting a demake.
5649782	5658686	They have an 8-bit version of Left 4 Dead that's been made by a guy named Eric Ruth.
5659486	5661747	And the game looks like it should be on the NES.
5661807	5663328	It supports up to two players.
5663688	5667270	And it's basically a PC version that is available to download right now.
5668130	5670511	So you can go find that, I believe.
5672180	5684916	They have it available on, he has his own website on Google Sites.google.com slash site slash Eric David Ruth Is it a hack of a game?
5685638	5687338	No.
5688119	5690699	Slash game dash left for dead.
5690979	5693400	And that's just like how you would spell the actual title.
5694900	5695520	And that's available.
5695560	5697460	Otherwise, you could do a search on Google and probably find it.
5698180	5698941	But it's pretty cool looking.
5699561	5702481	I thought it was an NES ROM hack at first, but no, it's a PC game.
5703802	5704322	Oh, I get it.
5704362	5704622	Okay.
5705262	5706242	Gotta put it on my cabinet, though.
5706962	5707242	Why not?
5707262	5708983	It's two player.
5710423	5710763	Also...
5711986	5718450	Rock Band on PlayStation 3 is being patched, or Rock Band 2 I should say, being patched on the PS3 to make way for the Rock Band Network.
5719110	5720951	And that's kind of cool.
5721151	5734979	They're going to actually have the Rock Band Network store in the interface, I guess, selling songs directly added by Rock Band fans and musicians and record labels through the new Rock Band Network.
5735260	5739242	Although I'm surprised, is this even available right now for the Xbox?
5739262	5739482	Yeah.
5739875	5741677	A more robust handling of chord hammer-ons and pull-offs.
5763055	5763756	Thank you for watching!
5782925	5808876	and then also Half-Life 2 on PC has a mod added to it now to update the graphics this is going to be kind of on par with what we saw in Half-Life Episode 2 kind of like what we saw in the Orange Box that they released and the mod adds a bunch of new detail into the game more realistic graphics, new models, what not about damn time
5809116	5810219	Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.
5810560	5814489	And apparently, right now, I believe it's just...
5816363	5821686	He's working on Episode 1 as well right now, so that should be coming soon.
5822306	5833831	But it basically adds HDR, high dynamic range lighting, also new updated models, textures, and 32 Steam achievements as well.
5834592	5837033	And so that's available, I believe, right now.
5837493	5843196	So you can probably find that on your favorite mod site, or yeah, it's on the Steam-powered forums.
5844276	5845477	So there's a link on there somewhere.
5845737	5847458	Half-Life 2 is a pretty epic game.
5847478	5850320	I think that it should fit the play.
5850600	5856484	I'm almost surprised that they haven't released an update themselves because it does look really good, the new graphics.
5858085	5860046	I'm surprised that Valve hasn't done it themselves.
5860386	5861267	But hey, someone else did.
5863094	5863794	And that's it.
5883803	5886025	January 14th is the Vampire Weekend.
5886185	5891990	So if you're a fan of them, Holiday, Cousins, and the Kids Don't Stand a Chance, we'll all hit Band Hero and Guitar Hero 5 on the 14th.
5892430	5895272	January 21st is a metal track pack.
5895632	5903839	You get Shadow's Fall with Still I Rise, Amon Amaroth with Twilight of the Thunder God, and get this, Death Lock with Laser Cannon Death Sentence.
5904740	5906721	So if you're a fan of Metalocalypse, you'll like that.
5906781	5908262	Dude, I fully threw up the horns for that.
5908363	5911105	And then on the 28th, Credence Clearwater Revival.
5911505	5938243	Yeah, Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising and Travelin' Band No, I totally am going to get those That's a very diverse lineup We'll put it that way Rock Band, not to be ignored, is doing their weekly announcement as well And this will be available this week on the 12th or the 14th Depending on what system you're on It's Alice in Chains Some new songs by them Grind, Heaven Beside You, Last of My Kind, We Die Young, and Your Decision So if you're an Alice in Chains fan, you're happy this week
5939023	5962953	and Microsoft has announced that Project Natal is coming this holiday season 2010 that was straight from the CES 2010 keynote I don't think that really surprises anyone though but they are committing to that time frame it will be out holiday 2010 no official name though it is still being called Project Natal that may end up being its name maybe just Natal I don't know but they are still calling it that at least in their press conferences hopefully they don't call it something stupid like we
5964588	5965688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5987594	5987894	DarkSakura
6004926	6012211	Well, Squeenix actually put out from the North American group that they are putting Mere out in the spring.
6013732	6021197	Not sure if Europe is included as well, but it's by the group that did Bullet Witch and Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.
6029964	6035593	There is, though, a PS3 exclusive version that's only going to be out in Japan called Nier Replicant.
6036594	6041542	And I'm actually really looking forward to this game, so I can't wait until we get it.
6041722	6043545	Well, I'm going to have to wait, but I'll look forward to it.
6044386	6058981	and then also Squeenix is bringing out Death by Cube on Xbox Live Arcade on the 20th of this month it's another twin stick multi-directional shooter type of game excuse me
6059822	6064265	and it's actually going to be based off of a bit of Robotron and Smash TV.
6064405	6065505	So that'd be pretty good.
6066186	6067306	Those are fun games.
6067787	6068667	More money, more prizes.
6068707	6069087	I love it.
6069347	6071849	Not to be confused with Death by Companion Cube.
6072329	6072449	No.
6073230	6074851	Or Cube, as in the movie.
6075031	6075211	Anyway.
6076452	6081435	Heavy Rain also has an official release date, but it's not the 16th.
6082836	6083997	It is the 23rd.
6084838	6089702	It was actually confirmed also by Sony.
6090622	6102452	So if you pre-order the game, you get free launch day access to the first downloadable Heavy Rain Chronicles episode, and otherwise it will be coming out later and you can pay five bucks for it then.
6103172	6109584	The European release dates for that is February 14th for mainland and February 26th for UK and Ireland.
6112029	6115911	And then we have Xbox Live stuff.
6116991	6118412	Well, more Xbox Live stuff.
6118792	6127695	They're actually saying that the Japanese developed games are more popular than most of the U.S.
6127875	6130076	ones, except for Castle Crashers.
6130156	6134278	But the ones that have been getting the most sales have been Virtual Lawn.
6135258	6138759	and Ikaruga and Triggerheart Excellica.
6140159	6157822	So actually, if you want to look at the top 10 Xbox Live Arcade games, just for 2009 in order, there's Virtualon, Oratario Tangram, Battlefield 1943, Castle Crashers, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Trials HD, R-Type Dimension, Shadow Complex, Ikaruga, King of Fighters 98, and Mega Man 9.
6158842	6163363	But over all time, number one is Castle Crashers, Virtualon, Oratario Tangram,
6163863	6171046	Ikaruga, Bomberman Live, Battlefield 1943, Triggerheart, Exelica, Uno, Dracula X, Fatal Fury Special, and Rez HD.
6171586	6173266	And I believe that's from Japan, though.
6173366	6173586	Yeah.
6174267	6175067	Not here in the U.S.
6175407	6178548	Because I think here the list would read something like, you know, Uno.
6179488	6179749	Yeah.
6180169	6180589	Probably.
6180789	6180989	Yeah.
6181569	6181849	Anyhow.
6183010	6183410	All right.
6183470	6187911	If that does it for the rapid-fire news tonight, then let's get to some Twitter topics.
6187951	6192333	I did want to say real quick, just to make a comment about the Xbox Live stats in Japan.
6193333	6200400	I am very proud of a game that I actually played quite often and unfortunately didn't get as much love as I would have liked it over here.
6201340	6210408	On Games on Demand, the top game downloaded in 2009 from Japan, Earth Defense Force 3, better known as Earth Defense Force 2017 over here.
6211129	6213951	The greatest game featuring giant ants.
6214872	6216373	Not as good as Bayonetta though, I'm telling you.
6217674	6218055	Telling you.
6219266	6222447	So good, in fact, I actually have four copies of this game.
6222627	6222967	Wow.
6223527	6224667	I have saved three.
6224727	6227008	I was eventually going to give them out on the show at some point.
6227368	6229528	I haven't done it yet, but they're collecting dust.
6230109	6230369	Soon.
6231069	6232589	Let's get to Twitter topics tonight.
6232929	6240791	We ask you guys every week for you guys to send your tweets to OLR on Twitter about things you think we maybe missed or topics you want us to discuss.
6241191	6244012	We have a few tweets tonight, a lot of story referrals tonight.
6244712	6246653	Actdeft says, I got a couple Twitter topics for you.
6246713	6250675	One of them is coming up later in the show, but the other one has to do with Gran Turismo 5 details.
6250955	6252856	Apparently some more details came out about the game.
6253416	6256578	And it's in the February edition of the PlayStation Official Magazine.
6256898	6270264	Over 1,000 vehicles, modeled cockpits, physical and mechanical damage modeling, Indy cars and tracks included, NASCAR cars and tracks included, up to 16 players online, high-definition video uploads directly to YouTube.
6270505	6271185	That's interesting.
6271625	6277288	Multi-display rendering, head tracking, full weather and night racing on all tracks, night and day cycle on all tracks.
6277328	6278768	That's going to be a pretty intense game.
6279468	6280389	Gran Turismo 5.
6280489	6283150	I'm sure that's going to be a huge thing they're going to show at E3 this year.
6284551	6284951	Moving on.
6284991	6285451	I doubt it.
6285511	6286692	It's coming out in February.
6287012	6287572	Is it that soon?
6287632	6288032	Oh, I know.
6288072	6288712	Not February.
6289293	6289813	Like April.
6290713	6291053	Oh, wow.
6291073	6292094	I didn't realize it was that soon.
6292474	6292834	Dang.
6293194	6293715	Alright, cool.
6294795	6296316	Is that just in Japan or is that over here too?
6296336	6296736	That's over here.
6298733	6307355	Ionotropic sent us a tweet, Final Fantasy XIII apparently is the biggest swindle ever, and links us to this topic of a thing that we ran on Destructoid.
6307675	6310916	It was a really negative review that came from a Hong Kong magazine.
6311856	6316497	I guess, and I'm trying to see what the name of the magazine is here, I don't see it, but it was some magazine in Hong Kong.
6316997	6321938	They called Final Fantasy XIII the biggest joke of 2009, saying the game is completely linear-y.
6323238	6324598	until the open area is near the end.
6324618	6326019	You can't even backtrack.
6326379	6333501	Of all the RPGs I've played in recent years, this is the first which has been so linear that it is little more than riding an amusement park ride.
6334181	6334521	Yowch.
6334841	6336222	They gave the game a 4 out of 10.
6337622	6340123	They gave the scenario a 2, saying it's a tearjerker.
6340163	6342943	The system a 1, saying it's such a crude system.
6343364	6347305	They gave the graphics a 9 and the sound a 7, but then the enthusiasm was a 1.
6348625	6351666	Sounds like they just rated it low to get attention.
6351686	6352226	Well, it worked.
6354611	6355912	So there you go.
6356012	6359856	That was from a Hong Kong magazine that I don't see the name of here.
6359936	6361017	Maybe somebody has it in chat.
6362598	6365060	More links from our Twitter peoples.
6366761	6371205	SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that talks about a new hack glitch on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
6371886	6375389	Apparently some players have now turned into super speed players.
6376590	6381713	So I guess now if you get a certain hack for Modern Warfare 2, you can run around just as fast as possible.
6382114	6386076	And if you cheat online with this, you are an asshole.
6387317	6387877	Let's see.
6388117	6392080	TigerClaw305 links us to this story about Rockstar San Diego.
6392480	6397823	The wives apparently of many of the employees are demanding better work conditions for spouses.
6397923	6398764	This is kind of interesting.
6399404	6402626	Apparently it's an open letter that was posted on a Gamasutra blog.
6402927	6403087	Ouch.
6404087	6433196	Rockstar San Diego meets the Midnight Club series of games and they're working on the Red Dead Revolver sequel right now apparently some of the blogs things are addressed in the blog 12 plus hour work days 6 day work weeks, cuts to medical benefits, a decline in bonuses and all that other stuff so apparently unfortunately the workers are not getting compensated the way they should be unfortunately in this economy it's not that easy to quit but at the same time that doesn't mean you abuse the workers I think if they really do have an issue though they should take it up with the state board
6433436	6437459	If they're working 12 hours, they're getting time and a half and then double time plus.
6438339	6441762	You know, so I wouldn't be too alarmed about that.
6441942	6443343	And you do have the option.
6444844	6446145	I mean, this is California.
6446185	6447766	We're in the freaking workers paradise here.
6448476	6453979	But when it's mandatory hours, and unfortunately this economy is not just easy to say, quick, go find something else.
6454039	6455079	There isn't a lot out there right now.
6455099	6458641	It technically is not legal to force a mandatory overtime.
6458741	6459241	Oh, they do it.
6459301	6459782	Companies do it.
6459802	6460262	They do it.
6460702	6463263	But if you protest it, they don't have to schedule you for it.
6463984	6469646	Because trust me, I have been scheduled for mandatory overtime and said, sorry, I have something else that I'm doing and gotten out of it.
6471267	6472448	So it's law.
6472888	6474789	They cannot make you do mandatory overtime.
6476666	6481810	Black Wolf seems to think that California is one of the states that didn't give overtime to those doing computer programming.
6482410	6483691	I don't know if there were exceptions.
6483711	6488374	I mean, I don't work in that field, so I wouldn't know as closely, but I don't think there's really exceptions to that.
6488394	6490476	The only way they can get out of that is if you're salaried.
6491496	6504265	And even so, I know at my work, they actually, they are really, really anal on addressing your hours because they do crack down really hard if you've made someone work more than eight hours in a day.
6506469	6508790	Spazinator PSN on Twitter sends a tweet.
6508830	6512351	How about the reports of Natal possibly being gimped as a cost-cutting measure?
6513231	6515612	I don't know if you can gimp something you don't really know about.
6516112	6519033	I mean, this system has not really been put out there for the masses to consume.
6519073	6521214	I mean, they didn't put it on the show floor at E3.
6521234	6524835	It was only behind closed doors and I believed only in a demonstration capacity.
6525175	6527496	So they might gimp it, but you'll never know.
6527796	6544742	The other reason they're saying it's gimped is because there was a processor built into the camera before, but to reduce costs, they're now using the actual Xbox 360 processor, and because of that, it's going to take 10-15% of the system resources to process the Natal capture stuff.
6545423	6548264	I see, so they're saying that the games are going to have some of their processing.
6548284	6549424	They're going to suffer because of that.
6549604	6550145	You know what, though?
6550165	6551065	Again, it's...
6551846	6563214	Yeah, but would you rather, okay, would you rather that they, the games maybe, you know, maybe they'll have to cut corners a little bit in the games and the, you know, say the Natal's like, I don't know, $79, $59 or whatever?
6566104	6570727	versus, they don't cut corners in the game, Project Natal is $200.
6571187	6574049	Plus that forces developers to make their games for Natal.
6574289	6577951	Like, they can't just throw on Natal controls onto existing games.
6578371	6580833	I kind of like that aspect about it, actually.
6581173	6583855	It forces programmers to make games for Natal.
6584215	6584715	You know what I mean?
6585395	6585556	Yeah.
6585696	6586036	We'll see.
6586776	6589878	It's pulling the Nintendo on them, if it's forcing them to do it.
6591019	6593300	Well, for the longest time, Nintendo had their own proprietary...
6594801	6595343	True, true.
6595363	6597070	That was a big thing back in the day with the cartridges.
6597873	6600964	Bobby Blackwolf sends us a tweet wanting us to talk about Duke Nukem Forever.
6602076	6602516	You jerk.
6603216	6604176	And you know why I said that.
6604897	6609198	And if you don't know why I said that, you can listen to Bobby's show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and our little phone call at the end.
6609618	6614259	And why I do not believe Duke Nukem Forever is worthy of news coverage at all.
6614839	6615239	Right now.
6615819	6616719	At this time, no.
6617479	6625941	Until they put something actually playable out there on the E3 show floor, and no more... I'm sick and tired of these video teases and things that just end up changing in a couple years anyway.
6626441	6627861	Put your goddamn money where your mouth is.
6628742	6629702	I'm sick of talking about it.
6630402	6633825	And look, I just spent a minute now talking about it, so please, let's move on with more stories.
6635046	6636587	Alright.
6637908	6644254	Well, there's some other fun stuff, including Sony is apparently increasing the storage capacity of Blu-ray discs.
6645475	6650459	The previous discs, of course, used by the PS3 were 25 gigabytes.
6650599	6652421	Now they're being expanded to 33.4 gigabytes, meaning that...
6656960	6657640	and DarkSakura.com.
6685191	6687873	It still doesn't fix the fact that the Blu-ray drive is kind of slow.
6688534	6689895	That's a little bit of a problem.
6689935	6695719	But hey, uncompressed textures, all sorts of fun stuff to save on processing power.
6695779	6698922	Could that mean larger installs down the line because the disc will hold more?
6698942	6700423	I'm going to have to install more to my drive?
6701854	6702174	Baby.
6704075	6707498	That's neat though that they can kind of do that and not have to release a new PlayStation 3.
6708038	6711460	I mean, I do kind of think that's a nice little feature is that they can kind of patch that in.
6712141	6713001	That will come in handy.
6713542	6718025	Especially when, you know, Final Fantasy 15 or whatever is on its way out and they want to do Uber cutscenes with it.
6718825	6721967	Huge, huge rumor right now, speaking of like Uber games.
6722408	6726470	Apparently, it's a rumor that Blizzard is currently working on a first-person MMO.
6726510	6731334	It's coming from a French gaming site, NoFrag, saying they have a reliable source.
6732014	6733135	Take with that what you need.
6733215	6733876	I know, everybody does.
6734536	6739561	Blizzard's next game, you know, after Diablo and after StarCraft, will be a first-person MMO.
6740722	6742744	You know, Blizzard apparently has been working on a new IP.
6742784	6749530	We kind of know that based off the fact that they've had some job postings and so forth in the past, and that it's an MMO based on, again, the job postings.
6749910	6753553	So, you know, maybe there is some credibility to this.
6753633	6755275	It could be interesting if it is a first person.
6755635	6760359	They are saying the game will take place in a futuristic world and players have two lives.
6760759	6769527	The first is kind of a Sims Online type of hub and then the second life is where you do fighting and other first person-y type stuff.
6769827	6771608	Apparently it's weird and metaphysical.
6772634	6774195	So that could be interesting, a new IP.
6774475	6776797	I'm glad they're trying to branch out and do something new, it's kind of risky.
6777237	6783101	But you know, I was just talking about this with some people last night, is that, you know, World of Warcraft is dominating as it is.
6783501	6792387	You know, Blizzard has to be thinking about their next steps in the MMO universe, because if they want a game to come out when WoW gets old, they need to be working on it already.
6792927	6795269	You know, because WoW's gonna age out in...
6795769	6798230	Maybe five years, maybe less, I don't know.
6798950	6800751	And they need to be thinking about the successor to that.
6801551	6803351	But of course, this doesn't sound like World of Warcraft 2.
6803391	6805072	This sounds like something else completely new.
6805452	6806072	Could be interesting.
6806692	6808473	Could be targeting a different audience altogether.
6808553	6808893	I don't know.
6810613	6815455	I can tell you the top secret game I played this week was also two very different types of modes in it.
6815915	6817716	So maybe that's the direction of MMOs.
6817756	6818096	I don't know.
6818656	6818916	Maybe.
6818936	6819036	Maybe.
6820083	6823705	Well, in other news, it's actually kind of sad.
6824305	6828848	There is a game that is no longer going to be shipped, no longer going to be published.
6828868	6834410	Nintendo has put the clothes on it, even though it's only been out for four months.
6835451	6838573	The Metroid Prime Collector's Edition is gone.
6839293	6840914	The only way you're going to get it is used.
6841874	6843495	It's been gone for a while, actually.
6843655	6844876	But it's officially gone.
6845316	6845616	Really?
6845636	6847957	Yeah, somebody finally, I guess, contacted Nintendo this week.
6848017	6848918	What do you know, Loki?
6849488	6850988	Well, it's been moratorium for a while.
6851708	6854269	I just figured they stopped making it.
6854309	6856329	They do that sometimes with some of their older games.
6856730	6858070	So that game was not long at all.
6858170	6859230	Yeah, that's weird.
6859430	6863831	Yeah, but it's just a re-release of Prime 3 and the other two games.
6864251	6869232	I get that, but at the same time, what they did to Prime 1 and 2 was new.
6869632	6870892	The whole widescreen and Wii controls.
6870912	6872613	Well, now they can re-release them separately, maybe.
6872693	6873133	I don't know.
6874396	6875237	Give them an excuse.
6875277	6876898	Hey, look, we're putting out new games.
6877559	6883423	Maybe Nintendo is finally being punished for just rehashing their GameCube shit and releasing it with this new play control.
6883443	6886986	They've stopped doing the new play control stuff.
6887006	6888867	At least I haven't seen any coming out.
6888967	6890548	Do you know how some of those other ones sold?
6892290	6894011	Prime 3 did okay, I think.
6894251	6897033	Or, well, the trilogy did alright for a little bit.
6897874	6898014	Um...
6899130	6899831	Thanks for watching!
6916079	6921404	Let's see, TigerClaw on our chat says maybe they'll do a Greatest Hits thing for those games so you could buy the Wii versions separate.
6921765	6928191	Even if they release those at $20 a piece, the collector's edition was a better deal to get all three of them for what, like $40 or whatever it was?
6928251	6928671	Pretty much.
6929432	6935158	The only reason I didn't get it is because I already owned three and I wasn't that attached to the Metroid series where I wanted to buy one and two.
6935298	6937540	It's not high def.
6937700	6939402	Don't you have the GameCube versions anyways?
6941012	6943093	No, those were my roommate's games at the time.
6943253	6944654	Those were Extraverse games, not mine.
6944974	6946075	He was the big fan of Metroid.
6946995	6947756	I do have the third one, though.
6947816	6949237	I did like Metroid Prime 3.
6949297	6950858	I just, you know, I wasn't as into it.
6951678	6954279	I think this other M is going to be more up my alley.
6954299	6955340	I like the 2D thing.
6955940	6959864	See, I was thinking that it's like you were saying, not being cost effective.
6959884	6963007	A lot of people maybe already had these games, were disillusioned.
6963668	6970455	If profit doesn't match output for cost, then it makes perfect sense for them to get rid of it.
6971825	6972345	Some other fun stuff.
6972365	6972585	Let's see.
7002657	7003878	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7025154	7026035	4 AT&T U-verse Subscribers
7041474	7043697	But I haven't really jumped on that yet.
7043737	7046721	I don't know if they have the U-verse internet in my area.
7046741	7047422	I think that's what it is.
7048062	7051427	Anyways, and they're going to have that coming out later this year.
7051847	7055652	And apparently any of the subscribers, I guess, to U-verse will have access to this.
7055772	7059076	I think you also probably have to have their internet as well.
7061271	7061871	It's kind of neat.
7061891	7066413	They didn't really say a whole lot about it, but there's going to be a lot of limitations on there.
7066433	7071175	You're not going to be able to record any of the programming on there with a DVR.
7071995	7077697	You're not going to be able to get access to all the different stations and stuff.
7077717	7082899	If it doesn't cost anything additional, then that wouldn't be too horrible, I guess.
7082919	7084200	I don't know.
7086621	7087743	I'm all for competition, you know?
7098891	7101393	Yeah, I need the F.I.O.S.
7101453	7104195	stuff to get here because that's going to be awesome.
7104696	7106617	You know, twice the speed of Comcast downloads.
7107658	7108158	Yeah.
7109179	7109639	All right.
7110420	7116645	Speaking of kind of like an all-in-one, everything built in on the Wii, Nyko, of course, releases some third-party controllers for the Wii.
7116665	7118006	You know, you usually see them at E3.
7118046	7120408	They do like the big inflatable Wii controls and stuff.
7120428	7120708	They have...
7121488	7128492	The wand that they released last time was pretty sweet with the ability to link up with their gun controller or whatever like that.
7128592	7132334	It'd be directly attached to it and stuff.
7132414	7135115	It's a little device that pushes the button on the controller.
7135851	7139314	Well, this year, what they're putting out is a $40 wand.
7139534	7141255	The wand is the name of their controller.
7141656	7146420	It is a Wiimote, basically, that includes MotionPlus inside it.
7146840	7150983	And it also does all the transport stuff that Loki's talking about, what the wand did before.
7151283	7157268	But apparently now, you will get to have the WiimotionPlus built in, so you don't have to buy an extra adapter for it.
7157809	7162332	That's pretty awesome, and for the same price as a normal remote, I mean, why wouldn't you buy that?
7162412	7164234	And the controller doesn't look that bad.
7164830	7166031	No, it's not a bad looking thing at all.
7166331	7168792	And it looks like, you know, kind of the same layout and everything.
7169172	7172434	I mean, unless you have to have the Nintendo made one.
7172474	7172935	I don't know why.
7172955	7174255	I'm surprised.
7174275	7175156	Might not be a bad deal.
7175176	7177557	Yeah, I wonder if they're taking this well.
7177957	7179979	Well, maybe you just want Wii Play really bad.
7180139	7180459	I don't know.
7182987	7183267	DarkSakura
7206355	7207676	The first one comes from Redertainment.
7208336	7215278	Dear OLR, I was listening to the 12609 show and you talked about the Xbox Live Avatar pets and thought you might like to be made aware of something.
7215978	7221840	Last summer Major Nelson sent out a tweet compelling people to get the word out that Final Fantasy XIII is on Xbox 360.
7222720	7226242	I was among the people who participated in this free marketing campaign.
7226802	7230323	Recently Microsoft sent out tokens to people who participated in the campaign and
7233165	7243413	All this Chocobo does is show up, fly around my head, and delight my avatar.
7243953	7246275	If I had not gotten this for free, I would not have paid for it.
7246595	7247856	However, I am grateful to have it.
7248196	7253540	I'm sure this means Chocobo 360 avatar pets will enhance my enjoyment of Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.
7255703	7265380	Staycare Redertainment This message has been brought to you by The Simple Truth of DarkSakura Boobies are fun Boobies are great fun
7267324	7273129	Hey OLR, the mailbag has been dry the past few months so I thought I would write.
7273609	7282056	I've been listening to the show for a few years and had to stop listening live due to me moving to a rural area and I have shitty satellite internet.
7282576	7284438	Sucks because I had three months of live left.
7284558	7291323	Oh well, I was listening to your first episode of the new year and the whole Windows mobile integrating to Xbox Live.
7291343	7293485	You guys didn't think much of it, but think about it.
7294026	7296888	Most video game characters use some sort of device in-game
7297268	7304890	your phone could replace any one of those devices from Snakes, Kodak, Metal Gear Solid coming to Xbox I guess to a P.I.P.
7304930	7314513	Boy or whatever plus with Natal which I actually don't think will be most things they promise it to be it could be interesting
7315373	7325617	Anyway, I read in my RSS feed today that Microsoft just allowed Razer, you know, the ones who make the morbidly expensive PC peripherals, to make and sell a controller and headset.
7325697	7326878	Seriously, what the fuck?
7327798	7330439	They just stopped Detail from getting on their share of the market.
7330940	7336022	I understand that it's a different category of product, but it still seems like a dick move on Microsoft's part.
7336662	7338363	If you don't mind a short rant, continue.
7338483	7339963	If you could care less, please skip to the end.
7340263	7340984	It's not that long.
7341844	7343125	Okay, you're still reading this, so what the heck?
7343645	7345966	I'm kind of pissed about how cheap people are getting about their games.
7346506	7349767	Not so much the development aspect of it, but the materials they actually give you.
7350327	7352228	First, the cases started getting super cheap.
7352508	7353648	See this Blu-ray case?
7353708	7357069	The same style is also coming out to Xbox 360 boxes very soon.
7357630	7358230	Let me pull it up.
7358890	7359210	Oh, yeah.
7359870	7360290	You see these?
7361231	7363652	Oh, yeah, I heard about that, that the boxes are going to change.
7363732	7363992	Okay.
7364232	7367053	I'm actually going to link this in chat real quick while I'm thinking about it.
7369954	7370454	And, um...
7372421	7373963	Going back to the email.
7375385	7380030	Another thing that follows this trend is releasing bonus content is download content.
7380070	7386177	Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the digital age and all, but it's not really fair to people like me who can't get online.
7386998	7392245	I just got Gears 2 GOTY Edition and the included, quote,
7392945	7401448	Multiplayer Maps, which I could care less about, and the extra campaign chapter, which is the reason I waited for the GOTY edition, were just a code for me to download on live.
7401888	7404529	Even Gears 1 platform had the bonus content on a disc.
7405309	7408270	If I have to shell out $60 for a game, at least give me what I deserve.
7409150	7411791	Anyway, this email is getting pretty lengthy, so I'll stop it here.
7411851	7414552	Keep up the great show from Tiberius Jones.
7416274	7417436	Well, thank you very much for the email.
7417496	7418258	I recognize that name.
7418378	7421444	Somebody used to email us a while ago, so I guess that explains why it stopped happening.
7423007	7423709	Good to hear from you again.
7426460	7436467	I get the whole mobile integration thing, but I think a lot of the things you were referencing there with the whole see something on your phone, I don't think there's the processing power behind it.
7436527	7438549	Do you remember when they came out and announced the PlayStation 3?
7439169	7443252	They were like, it's going to interface with the PSP and you can use it as their rear view mirror in Ridge Racer.
7443672	7444633	Ridge Racer!
7444653	7445253	That was lame.
7445393	7446134	That never happened.
7446474	7447655	It was a stupid idea too.
7447675	7458080	But I will say, they have done some neat integration where I can log on to my PlayStation 3 from my PSP and look at videos and even play some certain games across the internet.
7458540	7464823	So some of that integration would be cool, but I just think a mobile phone doesn't have that same oomph that a dedicated gaming device does.
7465423	7472987	Kind of back to something similar that I did say last week, I think what you would see that's a little more practical is that the phone has some type of game that...
7474071	7479313	Enhances the experience of a console game like, you know, Fable 2 Pub Games comes to mind.
7479673	7483154	But not anything really, I think, that integrated.
7483194	7484994	I just don't think mobile phones have that kind of power.
7486115	7487015	But I could be wrong.
7487055	7488035	iPhone has fun gaming.
7488956	7492077	Yeah, but even iPhone games have their own problems.
7492117	7494517	A lot of frame rate issues in a lot of those games, you know.
7494998	7495958	Maybe it's just my phone.
7495998	7496318	I don't know.
7497332	7498293	Alright, well thanks for the emails.
7498333	7500254	If you have more mail, you can always send us emails.
7500334	7507738	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com But in the meantime, while we wait for your emails, we need to get a little bit angsty on the show.
7508158	7511500	Thankfully, we don't have any stupid moron to inspire our FUs this week.
7511760	7513361	But that doesn't mean we're not going to let out the angst.
7529028	7529528	I have one.
7529749	7530429	The waiting game.
7530769	7531150	That's it.
7532371	7532831	Loki?
7535173	7542358	My FU goes to people that play on Xbox Live and decide to drop because you suck or you're losing.
7542478	7543259	I mean, come on.
7544320	7551345	At least in Grand Theft Auto, any score that you're getting is still going to count towards your rank, even if you suck.
7552166	7555028	I don't understand what the point is in dropping because you know what happens when you drop?
7555128	7557710	I rate you down anyway, so fuck you.
7559632	7561634	More people should use that rating system, honestly.
7562974	7563675	I have been now.
7563815	7566036	Everybody that drops, and trust me, it's a lot.
7566096	7567897	It's a few per game, every time.
7568358	7571660	And, you know, it's rare when we get people to actually stick in there.
7571980	7578684	Now, occasionally we drop, but that's because our internet connection at work sucks, and, you know, it just randomly kicks us out.
7579004	7581366	Not us quitting on purpose like some people do, so...
7581866	7584547	Unfortunately, you probably get rated down for quitting on purpose, even though you didn't.
7584748	7594313	Um, no, I am rated down 8% by people, and it's for aggressive, they said it's unsportsmanlike behavior or something like that.
7594553	7596214	Basically saying that I'm being too aggressive.
7596534	7599635	That's usually for trash talking, but I don't use a headset, so.
7600336	7600836	Fascinating.
7600856	7602697	There is no trash talking.
7602777	7603578	I'm just kicking their ass.
7603598	7603818	Dicks.
7604078	7604618	Babies.
7605118	7605379	Stupid babies.
7605399	7607520	Seriously, little pussies whining to their mommy.
7609972	7612774	There should be some type of check and balance for that for people who abuse that system.
7613414	7615616	I don't really have a lot of FUs, just FU to like Chaos.
7618298	7619459	Otherwise, things are fine.
7619819	7620840	I don't have a lot to be angsty about.
7621520	7627564	Alright, a couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1877-GAME-OLR but there's some stories still, so Loki.
7630086	7631807	This is kind of interesting.
7631907	7632287	There's...
7633921	7644684	A new patent at Microsoft, I guess, is a part of that's for muscle controllers, I guess, EMG muscle controllers.
7645244	7657568	And what it is is basically a device that you would, I guess, put on your arm or something that would detect the impulses from your nerves going to your different muscles.
7658088	7659749	So, for example, one of the...
7663794	7666557	Guitar Hero using their hand.
7666918	7677491	The movements and motions of pushing the different fret buttons are causing the different fret buttons to hit in the game.
7678783	7679884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7703030	7710652	But apparently Natalda is supposed to detect movement of at least 31 different parts of your body.
7712072	7713393	I don't know if it's really necessary.
7713473	7714933	Maybe something else that they're working on.
7715773	7716733	Whatever.
7717254	7719294	If it works, it's cheap.
7720474	7722295	I don't know if Air Guitar Hero would be as fun.
7722315	7724175	There's something about the plastic guitar that is charming.
7724235	7726736	I think it's just proof of concept stuff.
7726776	7731077	I don't think they would actually use it for something like that.
7731348	7735452	True, because Guitar Hero is a third-party game anyway.
7735492	7736773	It's not something that's really done by Microsoft.
7736793	7737633	And it would feel weird.
7738514	7742598	It would feel really weird just kind of moving your fingers.
7743936	7744076	IPsauce
7770844	7772865	and some of the benefits that they mention in here.
7773225	7773585	Let's see.
7773745	7774926	Full title trials.
7775006	7776266	First hour is free.
7776746	7780388	So imagine if you could actually download a full game and play it for an hour for free.
7780988	7783028	Cross game voice chat access.
7783048	7784689	I know that's come up before.
7785209	7787410	Member demo sharing a full game.
7788070	7789291	Token Wagering User to User Challenges
7805906	7807727	Maybe like user-generated trophies.
7809008	7811430	Early access to all store content.
7811490	7813351	Well, that's really no different than what they do on Xbox.
7813752	7815493	And then this is also what I think is very interesting.
7815913	7821897	Free access to PS1 classics, PSP minis, and PS3 PSP themes.
7822297	7826180	So imagine if you got a subscription service that suddenly lets you play all the PS1 games you wanted.
7827659	7830361	I wonder if that would be something you would want to go.
7831082	7844054	Anyway, some of the price options that they're talking about, as low as $2.99 pounds, which would be about $5 US, up to $14.99 in the pounds, which would be about $25.
7844534	7845635	That would be a monthly fee.
7846055	7850339	Also, some annual fees listed there, up between $32 American dollars to $160 US.
7851380	7851500	Corp.
7870363	7874429	Some of these features they're talking about, especially the token wagering, I want to know more about what that's all about.
7874829	7881538	And the whole subscription-based PS1 classics, it would be nice if you'd do some PS2 in there as well, being a part of this.
7882399	7885664	Loki, do you think some of this might be worth paying for, or are you just saying, forget it?
7885864	7887126	I'm not paying for any of this crap.
7887446	7890767	I don't play the PlayStation Network enough as it is.
7891187	7892407	Or play on the PlayStation Network.
7892688	7895668	In fact, I don't think I've ever played on the PlayStation Network with someone else.
7895808	7897289	Maybe in LittleBigPlanet once.
7897769	7899749	But I'm not paying for any of this.
7900150	7900570	I'm sorry.
7901250	7902970	It does not seem like anything I'm interested in.
7903050	7903971	And I don't care how much it is.
7904111	7904751	I'm not paying for it.
7905291	7911772	Game Guru says, again, if PlayStation Network goes subscription-based, there will likely be no reason for gamers to choose it over Xbox Live.
7912893	7913233	I don't know.
7913273	7917634	I think you might be jumping the gun a little bit because I'm not sure... They're not talking about taking anything away.
7918534	7922395	So I don't think they're talking about that now you're going to have to pay to play games online.
7922415	7926396	I don't think you could... I don't know if that would be possible because of the games that are already out there.
7926796	7929476	I don't think you could tell those games to suddenly not play online.
7929516	7929857	I don't know.
7930937	7931217	But...
7932337	7933898	Maybe they're talking about trying to enhance it.
7934058	7935760	And this could all just tie into Core.
7936840	7937661	A Core membership.
7938121	7938461	Who knows?
7939342	7944566	And Nat Elias, I hope I said that right, says, as long as there's a free alternative, I'm cool with it.
7945146	7948148	So again, the survey didn't say anything about taking anything away.
7948208	7950810	So I don't think PlayStation Network, as you know it today, will change.
7951350	7954833	But maybe they'll just try to get more money out of you by throwing extra stuff your way.
7954853	7955733	I just don't care.
7955833	7956514	I'm just not...
7957657	7958737	Thanks for watching!
7986198	7988899	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.
7988919	7994161	1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can send your phone calls or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.
7994742	8000964	If you've never called the show before, please dial ECHO-123 first before you give us a call.
8000984	8001545	That's ECHO-123.
8001845	8006447	And then that way you can make sure your connection is working right.
8006487	8007227	Let's go to the phones.
8007627	8008628	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8008648	8009068	Who's this?
8012069	8012549	Hi, GS68.
8012569	8012950	Hi, GS68.
8012970	8013610	What's on your mind, buddy?
8014689	8016929	I got an FC Mobile 2 this weekend.
8016949	8017950	I decided to give it a try.
8020110	8023831	My thoughts on it went down the more I played it, to be honest.
8024271	8024571	Really?
8026311	8028031	Like, for one, the system's pretty thick.
8028071	8033953	I mean, I'll kind of excuse that since it needs the thickness to accommodate NES cartridges.
8035673	8040554	But, like, after playing for about five minutes, my hands started to get sore.
8041714	8041854	Like,
8042438	8046761	I can feel the soreness lingering like hours after I played it.
8047881	8051083	So is it just not, I don't know, ergonomically well made or what's the deal?
8052224	8055066	It's probably just not ergonomically well made with it being very thick.
8055746	8056186	I see.
8057067	8060369	And then the D-pad is like not too great either.
8060569	8064692	Like, for one, it's PSP-style D-pad and I hate those kind of D-pads.
8065232	8069214	Also, the D-pad pieces wouldn't have the diagonally so this can
8070802	8075465	Sometimes it's for me, I find more action type of games like Zanac and Legend of Zelda.
8075985	8082810	But on the plus side, that means I can do some weird glitches like pressing left and right at the same time in Zelda 2, causing Link to slide around all over the place.
8083370	8083631	Fun.
8085512	8093677	And then, it comes with wireless controllers, and I tried those, and those are more comfortable to hold, but I found the D-pads are pretty crappy too.
8094178	8094598	Like, they go to
8095445	8101987	Instead of having what I call PSP D-pad syndrome, they now have 360 D-pad syndrome where they have the tendency to press the wrong direction.
8102127	8102388	I don't know.
8102428	8104728	Maybe the quality varies from unit to unit.
8104748	8105109	I don't know.
8123516	8126697	I also have really fat thumbs that could play into it.
8126737	8127137	I don't know.
8128897	8129337	No idea.
8129657	8130877	What kind of games are you playing?
8130917	8131897	The classic stuff.
8131937	8134618	I know you said Zelda, but what other classics are you enjoying?
8135698	8138739	I was also playing Zanac, which is a shoot-em-up by the St.
8138759	8140179	Bill behind the Guardian Legend.
8141499	8141799	Nice.
8141899	8143379	Guardian Legend is a must.
8145740	8147460	Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?
8148160	8151381	Yeah, I got around to playing Castle of Unity Adventure Rebirth.
8151961	8152081	Mm-hmm.
8152549	8154471	Oh, I've played that a little bit on Wii as well.
8154511	8155051	What'd you think?
8157453	8158294	I like it so far.
8158794	8163838	I mean, it's about time we finally got a new classic-vania game, as some of the fanbase like to call it.
8164418	8167681	Yeah, it feels very much like a classic Castlevania game.
8167741	8171284	It was like a very Castlevania 3-esque game, which makes sense.
8171344	8172685	It's a remake of the Game Boy games.
8172785	8175027	But, you know, yeah, I kind of felt the same way.
8177248	8181712	And what I like is that you can choose between normal jumping and classic jumping.
8182478	8190485	And honestly, I like classic jumping better because when I play normal, like, jumping physics are kind of weird, especially for a classic Vayne game.
8190585	8191766	Like, it tends to throw me off.
8191806	8205958	Like, I'll try to, like, I'll jump and I'll press the D by the other way and hit the whip button so I can, that way, I can whip in the opposite direction I'm jumping by then moving backward instead, which kind of throws me off and causes me to do stuff I didn't intend to do.
8207253	8208314	It's still challenging though.
8208354	8209915	Castlevania is still a very challenging game.
8209955	8211776	But yeah, a lot of folks might have missed that that came out.
8211796	8218841	There's been a lot of those rebirth type of games that came out between Contra, I think, Gradius, and now this Castlevania.
8219342	8224865	Oh, and I've been noticing that some people have been complaining about the lack of a save feature or suspend feature.
8225406	8226547	There is a stage select.
8227227	8232371	If you go to the title menu, select Game Start and hold right for a few seconds, it'll go to stage select.
8233420	8234020	Oh, nice.
8234581	8235421	Little pro tip.
8235601	8237802	That's like the type of thing I would have read in Nintendo Power.
8238523	8245427	Alright, GS68, have fun with your FC Mobile and maybe hopefully you'll get a little more comfortable and good luck with Castlevania.
8246827	8247468	Alright, take care, buddy.
8247948	8248228	You too.
8248949	8250369	Bye-bye.
8250389	8254572	877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8256513	8257393	Let's go to the phones.
8258113	8258974	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8258994	8259334	Who's this?
8260235	8260955	Hey, what's up?
8261035	8261575	It's Ranma.
8261795	8262536	What's up, Ranma?
8263885	8270008	Call to give a nice little game review Poppin' music for the Wii
8279346	8297482	Yeah, because you have to understand, I'm the average gamer and I've come to determine that when it comes to a lot of these B-Money games, when people kind of shit on said B-Money game that comes to the US, 9 out of 10, they're just mad because the Japanese music that they loved in the arcade or import versions out on the US release.
8298587	8299428	Okay, I gotcha.
8299728	8309434	You know, I thought some of the early DDR releases were kind of crap, but I think one of the best DDR releases they ever did was one of the American ones, Ultramix 2.
8309794	8311575	I think that was probably one of the best DDRs they ever did.
8312095	8315017	And I don't think Beatmania for the US was terrible.
8315137	8316718	I think they tried to do some cool things with it.
8316758	8318099	It's a bummer they didn't get to do a sequel.
8319432	8321454	I enjoyed Beatmania for PS.
8321554	8323336	I really enjoyed that, so you know.
8323596	8330223	But now poppin' music I was a little apprehensive about because A, it's the Wii, and B, Beat'n Groovy was so fucking terrible.
8330623	8333646	But how does poppin' music make it better?
8334748	8338071	First things first, we never mention Beat'n Groovy again.
8338191	8340033	It's on the list of band names.
8340694	8341415	I apologize.
8342062	8343663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8361929	8366612	If you shake the controllers to your side, that's hitting the outer green buttons.
8367392	8374257	If you shake on like a 45 degree angle or straight ahead, you hit the middle blue buttons.
8374597	8382422	And if you move the Wiimote or the Chuck with one, you know, to your left or to your right, you hit the center red button.
8382862	8387605	Also, if you hit them both together across like an X, you can also hit it at the red button as well.
8388015	8388816	That sounds terrible.
8389316	8389757	I'm sorry.
8389917	8391158	Well, how does it play?
8391298	8393360	I mean, it might sound bad, but does it play well?
8394061	8397524	To me, it's kind of like a cross between playing Power of Power and Somebody Amigo.
8398621	8399481	I could see the Samba.
8399682	8400242	I could see that.
8401042	8401863	How's the song list?
8401923	8404344	Is it very Japanese-centric, or did they Americanize it?
8404364	8404844	What did they do?
8405925	8411187	They Americanized it, but there's some downloadable content which does have Japanese songs on it.
8412128	8419011	One of my favorite songs is Miracle Moon, so I'm really excited about getting a chance to download that song, actually.
8420211	8421792	Oh, they have download content?
8422272	8422633	Oh, wow.
8422713	8422953	Okay.
8424444	8427405	Are there a lot of songs that longtime Bomani fans will recognize?
8427445	8428566	I know Miracle Moon, obviously.
8428906	8429506	Other stuff like that?
8430866	8435388	I don't remember a couple of the other ones, but there's some familiar ones in there.
8435468	8441610	I did write on my Twitter about some of the bands' names I saw when I was browsing through the downloadable content.
8442630	8443911	Is there a lot of downloadable content?
8446632	8449713	I believe there's like 40 downloadable... No.
8450473	8450673	There's...
8452097	8454058	20 downloadable songs.
8454618	8457059	There's 10 different topics.
8457300	8459040	Each topic has two songs.
8459561	8463903	And pretty much the majority of them are Japanese songs from pop and music games.
8464123	8466424	And I think Beatmania, but don't hold me to that.
8466704	8469705	Well, thanks for the reminder that the game was even out because I forgot.
8469845	8473167	So I guess maybe it's not as bad as a lot of people are saying it's going to be, huh?
8474068	8475349	You gotta thank Twitter for that.
8475369	8480753	If it was for one of my friends who was at Best Buy matching it, I wouldn't have known to go over to go purchase it.
8481233	8481674	Interesting.
8482634	8484396	Anything else in your gaming week you want to talk about?
8486877	8488038	That pretty much is it.
8488098	8492201	I will be playing Lost Odyssey later tonight before I go to bed.
8493802	8494503	I'll say this much.
8494543	8495344	Pop music was $29.
8495984	8498646	I personally thought it was a good game to purchase.
8498886	8501228	If it was more than that, I probably would not have bothered.
8502418	8504759	and there's also a two-player and four-player mode.
8504799	8514941	Four-player mode is pretty much you have like all nine of the buttons out and I think four-player mode has all the buttons but each person takes a Wii mode to hit the correct button.
8515441	8515862	Interesting.
8516502	8516682	Yeah.
8517802	8518082	All right.
8518482	8519983	Well, DJ Ranma, we're going to let you go.
8520183	8524564	I actually wanted to say I was thinking about you right before you called, seriously.
8525464	8527005	We must be on the same wavelength.
8527485	8531206	Seriously, about last time you were here and we went to Japantown.
8531966	8532226	Yeah.
8533607	8534508	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8560069	8562031	Well, we hope to see you soon, DJ Ranma.
8562331	8564673	Until then, we'll just rely on the phone calls, okay?
8565294	8565734	You got it.
8565814	8566575	All right, take care, buddy.
8566615	8568516	Have fun popping music-ing away.
8569437	8569818	I will.
8569998	8570258	Later.
8570278	8572240	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8572300	8573801	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8574201	8576163	I guess we'll do about one more call here tonight before we go.
8576744	8577564	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8577584	8577885	Who's this?
8579949	8581069	Hey, Azako, what's on your mind, buddy?
8581089	8582030	I hear you.
8582050	8583431	We don't mind people killing time with us.
8583471	8584191	What's on your mind?
8584532	8586193	What do you think about this whole 3D TV?
8586233	8589415	We talked about it a little bit earlier in the show with Avatar and stuff.
8589435	8589915	What do you think?
8608067	8612772	I mean, if 3D's gonna make a comeback, it better be implemented right this time.
8613253	8615195	Not that red and blue stuff.
8615856	8616817	Not that red and blue shit.
8617357	8621903	It has to be like 3D that you can actually see in the colors, in the actual colors.
8622243	8624405	Well, the technology's come a long way, to be fair.
8625424	8629588	I mean, you have to keep in mind, not every game is meant for 3D anyways.
8630329	8638896	Case in point, some of them like Gran Turismo 5, which they did a tech demo over the course of the expo where they had it in 3D and it added nothing.
8639657	8641519	And absolutely nothing to the experience.
8642200	8649006	Whereas games such as Gears or... I think it was... I want to say it was some other games.
8649266	8650007	I think one of them...
8651100	8655562	The new one coming out, Dark Void, that one had a 3D demo of CES.
8656883	8659424	And that one pretty much made the experience a lot better.
8661024	8663646	So the mileage may vary pretty much.
8665806	8666987	What about Game Room?
8667007	8667767	What did you think about that?
8669488	8671509	Oh, the new thing for Xbox Live?
8671609	8671769	Yeah.
8672957	8674538	Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
8674558	8684726	I mean, I've been detached from my 360 for quite some time, but I did hear about the, I don't know, I guess it's just Microsoft trying to emulate Home.
8686072	8686972	That's the way I see it.
8687072	8689433	I think it's kind of a combination of home and virtual console.
8689453	8692594	I hear a lot of people comparing it to home, but I think there's also a lot of virtual console.
8692614	8701377	I mean, the way you see it is just them rendering a virtual arcade that Sony could easily have already baked into their home app.
8702037	8703097	That's pretty much it.
8703157	8711040	All they're doing is Microsoft is just dressing up and taking from what Sony's already done months, you know, already in the past.
8712218	8739737	and another thing I want to talk about you said earlier that certain phones were designed for the social networking aspects within video games right now there's like a shift going on within mobile devices obviously the iPhone was the catalyst for it but you have platforms like Android, Windows Mobile Blackberry
8740541	8744286	All of them are not your cheap run-of-the-mill cell phone platform.
8744366	8745328	They're pretty robust.
8745348	8749573	I mean, I would know because I work with most of them professionally.
8750595	8756342	So they're worlds better than the phones that I used to work in when I graduated college almost four years ago.
8757136	8781303	I got that, but, you know, again, I look at something like the PSP, which is a dedicated game system, and they still have yet to pull off the, and I'm not talking about, like, you know, I get, like, if they build something separate on the phone that ties into the game somehow, like, again, I get the pub games example, but, like, you know, this whole, like, you are going to actually, because, you know, in the email it kind of talked about, imagine you're Solid Snake and you can whip out your phone and something happens on your phone.
8781343	8785584	I'm like, I don't see that level of integration happening on phones, period.
8786184	8788125	I mean, it can be done.
8788185	8789726	I mean, it all depends on the platform.
8789766	8791567	Case in point, Android, for example.
8792027	8799431	You can actually run multiple apps, apps that actually support push, that can run while your phone is running in the background.
8799992	8809877	So, let's say, you know, you do get an alert from, you know, from something like you described with Solid Snake, it will just pop up on your phone, vibrate, and inform you.
8812378	8817282	The same could also be done with iPhone if they opened up the platform and had support for multiple apps.
8817343	8821326	But Android is a good example of how you can accomplish what you just described.
8823117	8825358	Well, it'll be interesting to see if it takes off.
8825439	8828220	I just don't know, you know, especially with the iPhone dominating everything.
8828240	8841489	I mean, if they could pull off Facebook and Twitter and all the other social networking sites on any given mobile platform, even the good ones, you know, like Android or, you know, Blackberry, then it could be done.
8841549	8844431	You just have, it just has to be executed.
8844891	8852436	Yeah, but social networking is not as much bandwidth as, you know, a freaking game running video to your phone, you know?
8853069	8853970	Well, it can't be done.
8854010	8857655	I mean, you're underestimating the power of cell phones now.
8857695	8858295	Perhaps.
8858576	8865624	Obviously, you would have won the argument several years ago, but the game is different now.
8866065	8868508	It's a different mobile environment.
8868568	8872613	When you have phones that have tens of megabytes of memory...
8873632	8877813	to run apps and high-speed connections and bigger screens.
8878053	8885116	I can understand that, and especially Japan has been ahead of the game in that market for a while, but how much have those really penetrated the entire marketplace?
8885156	8893098	The G1 is pretty much a good baseline Android phone that's slated to get 2.0, so it still has some fighting in it.
8893539	8897960	Plus any other Android phone, and obviously the iPhone, the BlackBerry,
8899891	8902353	I'm naming these off my hand right now.
8903033	8905114	So there's a lot that could be done.
8905194	8909817	It's just a matter of the execution and the design.
8910438	8915441	In other words, it's not impossible and it shouldn't be ruled out.
8915501	8923446	It just has to be meticulously planned to work well within the confines of how it ought to function.
8923946	8925787	Alright, I will see you there.
8926007	8927688	I appreciate the perspective.
8927788	8931770	I won't say it's impossible, but I'll still say probably not anytime soon.
8933972	8935853	Anytime soon is very close right now.
8936053	8939675	When Android comes very close to second place and
8940195	8947577	you know, behind the iPhone you'll have the install base and the wherewithal to execute it.
8947797	8949697	Even with BlackBerrys out there.
8950537	8954658	By the end of this year I should have won the argument.
8955998	8956699	We shall see.
8957039	8958299	And if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.
8958379	8959879	It sounds like it would be a good thing for gaming.
8960199	8962100	If Rob's wrong, he has to wear the Tingle costume.
8962160	8962920	Fuck that shit.
8962980	8963380	No way.
8964120	8967981	I mean, right now you're probably going to get a refresh anyways with a new model.
8968681	8972984	So they may end up selling you, you know, a Blackberry or an Android phone or something like that.
8973644	8974825	And those are very powerful.
8974865	8977006	Those are much powerful than your standard run of the mill.
8977907	8978127	All right.
8978647	8978947	All right.
8979007	8981229	Well, Zach, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up.
8981249	8982429	But thanks so much for the call, okay?
8982449	8983330	We appreciate the other perspective.
8983350	8983530	All right.
8983610	8984110	Have a good one.
8984511	8984711	Later.
8984811	8985031	Bye.
8986092	8986372	All right.
8986752	8987993	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8988033	8989093	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
8989334	8990094	Something else occurred to me.
8990294	8990754	Yeah, what's that?
8990874	8994817	You know, there are actually regular cell phones that would be powerful enough to do stuff like that in Japan.
8995694	8998197	Yeah, but, you know, not anything I'm going to see.
8998357	9005428	But there's been a tendency now for companies to compete with the smartphones by implementing some of the stuff they've got out in the K-Ti already, so...
9006149	9015074	I get what he's saying, that it's possible, but unfortunately, I guess he seems to think it's going to happen a lot sooner than I'm giving it credit for.
9015154	9025199	Maybe the technology's moving a little faster than I'm thinking, but I kind of go, you know, you have to have a lot of people who are going to use it in order to make it effective to build, if that makes sense.
9025819	9027500	That's my little concern.
9027620	9029301	But I get what Zaku's saying.
9029381	9035584	He's saying probably I'm not giving the technical side of it enough appreciation, and maybe the way it came off I wasn't, so that's fair enough.
9036274	9036534	All right.
9037094	9040876	Anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's show once we do last-minute stories.
9040896	9041616	I don't want to skip those.
9042116	9044757	DarkSakura, Loki, any of you guys have last-minute stories tonight?
9045257	9046138	Or do we cover it all?
9047798	9050099	The Mega Man fan movie is going to be coming out soon.
9050660	9054041	This was shown off in a trailer back in November 2008.
9055842	9061244	And apparently it will be coming out, available on the Internet soon enough.
9063797	9065657	I'm trying to see when exactly it's going to be.
9065977	9067598	It's going to be 109 minutes long.
9067618	9081741	And I guess it will be available probably on the website for the film, which is megaman.ninjin.com.
9081841	9083301	That's N-I-N-G-I-N.
9084321	9088782	And they actually have some stuff from that.
9089462	9091463	I guess it was being shown at MAGFest 2010.
9094191	9097438	There's a rough cut that they showed, and that happened actually today.
9098740	9101726	So, soon enough, I guess.
9101947	9103089	It looks kind of interesting.
9103109	9105754	The guy that had been playing Wily, though, kind of looks...
9107796	9108676	I see your point Nothing will happen
9135950	9138071	is that it?
9138651	9165322	this is kind of interesting there was a comment I guess Gamasutra ran a feature on third party publisher reactions to the abysmal sales of uninteresting games or I guess party games one of the comments was one thing for sure the focus has changed stores like Target and Best Buy have reportedly told game publishers not to even bother approaching them with collections of mini games
9165862	9191789	which they will no longer pick up so good for them I think that's a great thing and you know honestly I've been seeing a lot more of that just from my customers and honestly I kind of figured that anyways and I steer them away from that crap so only good stuff but sadly enough though even the good stuff I recommend you know like even like the No More Heroes and that kind of thing and Mad World just doesn't do well
9192708	9193168	That's a bummer.
9193188	9196949	Because stupid parents out there want to buy that fucking minigame crap.
9197969	9200170	This is what's wrong with gaming nowadays.
9200390	9200750	The Wii.
9200890	9202630	The Wii is everything that is wrong with gaming.
9202650	9203671	The Wii ruined everything.
9204031	9204511	Exactly.
9205391	9209672	But they still have... You know, there's certain games that come out on the Wii that you have to have.
9209732	9213433	Like, I feel justified owning a Wii because there is some real good shit that comes out for it.
9213453	9214453	A new Super Mario Bros.
9214513	9215774	Wii was fantastic.
9218715	9219155	Crazy stuff.
9219415	9221476	Hey, one of our chatters is cluing us in on a last minute story.
9221496	9223116	And actually, this is something I do remember reading.
9223156	9224936	I just neglected to put it on the show world tonight.
9225237	9230698	But Jay Dizzle in our chat room at chat.orange.com is saying, Crayon Physics is on sale till the 15th.
9230998	9232118	You can pay as much as you want.
9232238	9234799	It's doing that whole thing where you can pay what you feel the game is worth.
9235199	9236859	You got some people paying a penny for it.
9237559	9243061	Maybe they're hoping some people will pay $150, you know, like happened, I think, when World of Goo did that.
9243501	9244101	So, you know...
9244761	9247986	I would say maybe like 5, 10 bucks, whatever you believe is appropriate.
9248046	9249808	Or maybe I'll probably go buy it and pay $6.66.
9249848	9250449	I think that would be fun.
9250469	9250509	Or $6.90.
9256454	9259135	DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
9259155	9264577	I finally learned to knit a scarf without messing up my rows Congrats See, doesn't it look nice?
9286683	9312935	my final thought is LA tomorrow, Seattle Friday I got a busy week ahead Loki, your final thought my final thought is I wish people would stop quitting out of my games on Grand Theft Auto and you know I don't know what I gotta do I'm even nice usually when I'm like a thousand dollars ahead I'll just fuck around so that you know at least I'm not like pissing people off although there was that one time that I was trying to get a high streak I got 17 streak
9314704	9316945	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
