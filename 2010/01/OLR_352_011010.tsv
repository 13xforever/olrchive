7000	13000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey
14000	19000	Tonight, January 10th, 2010, Microsoft shows us their game room at CES,
19000	22000	a popular Nintendo Wii game is no longer being published,
22000	25000	and could NBA Jam be making a comeback?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	40000	We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
40000	43000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next three hours.
43000	47000	Also, as always, the one and only lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47000	48000	Hi.
48000	49000	How are you?
49000	50000	Frustrated.
50000	52000	I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you frustrated?
52000	59000	Because I realized that I started stitching in two wide stitches, well, actually stitches too many,
59000	65000	on this tube scarf I was making, so now I have a doll-sized tube dress.
65000	68000	Well, you know, if you decide that you don't want it, you could always set it on fire.
68000	70000	That would be pretty amazing.
70000	73000	But that would mean setting my stuff on fire.
73000	76000	Well, you know, at least you could watch it go down in a blaze of glory.
77000	80000	Also, say hello to the one and only pyromaniac tech master, Lowkey.
80000	81000	Hello.
81000	82000	How are you?
82000	83000	I'm fine.
83000	85000	Have you set fire to anything this week?
85000	86000	No.
86000	87000	Not this time. All right.
87000	93000	Well, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
93000	95000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
95000	97000	That's at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
97000	102000	So thanks, of course, to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth, as they do every Sunday night.
102000	107000	We do have a lot of news to get into tonight, but of course we always started off with a little bit of how was our gaming week.
107000	112000	But we're going to mix it up a little bit tonight because we did something special this week.
112000	114000	I know a lot of you guys have been listening to this show for a little while.
114000	116000	But if it is your first time listening, hello, welcome.
116000	121000	You know, it's just like three friends who met a long time ago at an arcade, believe it or not.
121000	126000	Playing DDR was the game we used to play back in the day and decided to start a radio show about games.
126000	129000	And here we are almost eight years later still doing our show.
129000	130000	Pretty amazing.
130000	131000	Anyhow.
131000	132000	Translation?
132000	134000	Give us jobs.
134000	136000	Professional jobs.
136000	137000	Here's the thing.
137000	142000	We don't hang out a lot like we used to during the week.
142000	144000	You know, this show is kind of the way we all hang out.
144000	147000	I mean, once in a while there's a party or something's going on.
147000	149000	And it's not like we avoid each other.
149000	150000	It's just we're all busy.
150000	152000	You know, I work a day job.
152000	154000	Dark Sakura has school and other things she's got to do.
154000	155000	I'm avoiding you.
155000	158000	And Loki, you know, just bought a house.
158000	160000	And they both have the married life going on.
160000	162000	And I'm driving to the Bay Area for stuff all the time.
162000	164000	We don't see each other an awful lot during the week.
164000	166000	But this week was a little different.
166000	168000	We actually went on an O.L.R. date.
168000	172000	Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki all went to see Avatar.
172000	175000	As many of you have apparently because it's what?
175000	178000	It's already like the number three highest grossing movie ever.
178000	181000	And it looks like, based on the take this week,
181000	183000	there's a very good chance it's going to take over the Batman movie.
183000	185000	They're saying it could even take over Titanic.
185000	187000	So a lot of you have seen the movie.
187000	190000	So I don't know if we're going to sit here and review it
190000	192000	because, you know, most of you have already seen it it sounds like.
192000	195000	But how about our thoughts on the movie?
195000	198000	Because we did get to see it in 3D,
198000	201000	which I thought was, you know, kind of different
201000	203000	because I don't see a lot of movies in 3D.
203000	204000	I mean, it's kind of a new thing.
204000	206000	The only other movie I've seen in 3D was Up,
206000	209000	which, you know, didn't use the 3D as heavily.
209000	211000	Like, I didn't think the 3D kind of added a lot to Up.
211000	214000	But certainly Avatar kind of added some stuff to it.
214000	216000	Loki, what did you think of Avatar?
216000	217000	This is your second time seeing it, right?
217000	218000	Yes, it is.
218000	220000	By the way, keep it spoiler free
220000	223000	because some of our chatters have not seen it yet and want to.
223000	225000	Have you seen Pocahontas?
225000	227000	You've seen Avatar.
227000	229000	I call it Space Pocahontas.
229000	231000	Or FernGully.
231000	234000	FernGully means Pocahontas in space with Smurfs.
234000	236000	No, I like just...
236000	239000	Even the technology behind the whole movie is pretty awesome.
239000	244000	Like, a lot of the 3D stuff, it's not so much, you know,
244000	246000	Hey, look, we made a 3D movie,
246000	248000	so we're going to have tons of stuff flying at your face.
248000	251000	Or, you know, we're going to scare you.
251000	253000	Ooh, look, it's coming towards you.
253000	254000	You know, nothing like that.
254000	257000	It's just really cool looking.
257000	259000	Like, a lot of the shots, you know, look very realistic.
259000	261000	And it's kind of amazing when you think about it
261000	264000	that all the backgrounds and everything in the movie
264000	266000	are really computer generated.
266000	269000	And, I mean, a lot of it you kind of forget that it is
269000	271000	because it looks really good.
271000	274000	But the storyline, I mean, it's just all right.
274000	276000	It's not, you know, you don't really go to see this movie
276000	279000	because, you know, it's such a deep storyline.
279000	282000	It's just very predictable, but it's got great characters in it,
282000	285000	and it's just a fun movie.
285000	288000	Darsagra, what did you think?
288000	291000	Well, I had very low expectations,
291000	295000	and then my expectations were sort of pooped on.
295000	296000	I thought it was really good.
296000	298000	I'm going to see it again, because you know me.
298000	300000	If I like a movie once, I'll see it twice.
300000	301000	How many times did you see Silent Hill in the theaters?
301000	302000	Like, four or five?
302000	303000	Four.
303000	304000	I saw Star Trek eight times.
304000	306000	Oh, my God.
306000	307000	But keep in mind, when it got to the cheapo theater,
307000	308000	I was just going every week.
308000	310000	Oh, I gotcha.
310000	312000	Although, actually, I think five of my times seeing it
312000	314000	were in the full-price theater.
314000	316000	So, if that's any indication.
316000	321000	I think that the 3D was implemented very, very nicely.
321000	323000	Instead of, like Loki said, of it being,
323000	328000	ah, 3D, ah, it was more immersive.
328000	331000	Like, there were a few things that did surprise me
331000	334000	as far as just, you know,
334000	337000	I really have no other comparison to put this to,
337000	339000	but you know, the head tracking mode for Wii,
339000	342000	that little hack, it made me think of that.
342000	344000	Because it almost felt sometimes like you could peek around
344000	346000	the screen and see stuff inside of it,
346000	349000	or if you moved closer, you'd get a wider view.
349000	352000	It was that kind of immersion.
352000	354000	And it actually did not give me a headache,
354000	356000	because the other movies I've seen in 3D was
356000	360000	I saw Nightmare Before Christmas twice in IMAX, in 3D.
360000	363000	And that gave me kind of a headache and made me pass out.
363000	366000	You know, I was explaining that I have a problem with 3D,
366000	368000	because I tend to get really motion sick.
368000	371000	But I think I only got motion sick once,
371000	375000	and that was in the flying, one of the big flying scenes.
375000	379000	And other than that, I mean,
379000	381000	especially since I wear glasses
381000	383000	and was wearing the 3D glasses over my glasses,
383000	386000	I didn't really have as bad of a problem as I expected to,
386000	389000	except when I took the 3D glasses off,
389000	391000	I had a big adjustment,
391000	394000	because I'm looking through two lenses
394000	396000	trying to get the 3D effect out of it.
396000	398000	But story-wise, yeah, predictable.
398000	400000	We saw this coming.
400000	404000	But it was predictable in a gratifying way,
404000	406000	I want to say, if that makes sense.
406000	409000	Like, oh, yeah, that's a little bit more
409000	411000	than what I thought would happen with it.
411000	413000	Or, yeah, that's how that should go.
413000	414000	I'm fine with that.
414000	416000	But I liked it.
416000	418000	I was already looking up stuff online.
418000	421000	There's gonna be a sequel, which I'm looking forward to,
421000	423000	although I'm wondering what direction
423000	425000	they're gonna go with it.
425000	427000	But, yeah, actually, I'm really impressed.
427000	430000	As a language nerd, I was very impressed
430000	432000	with the construction of the language.
432000	434000	Yeah, I guess they built that language for the movie.
434000	436000	Like, some professor at a university did it.
436000	440000	Yeah, a linguistics professor created the language.
440000	442000	And it actually...
442000	444000	Some of the other ones that I've studied,
444000	446000	it uses, actually, the grammar structures
446000	448000	very similar to American Sign Language.
448000	450000	And I notice it actually has things in common
450000	453000	with Japanese and with American Sign Language
453000	456000	in terms of your object order.
456000	459000	So I was actually pretty, pretty pleased with that.
459000	462000	Reading just so much more into it,
462000	464000	I have to say that I'm impressed overall
464000	466000	with the work that went into it.
466000	468000	And with the fluidity of the motion capture,
468000	470000	that was very impressive, and I know that that was
470000	473000	a pretty new technology that they used with it, too.
473000	476000	I also went back and read an interview
476000	478000	as to why people were blue.
478000	480000	Because, and to paraphrase the quote,
480000	482000	it's that, well, it was to contrast
482000	485000	with the skin tones of humans, first of all,
485000	487000	to enhance the bioluminescence,
487000	489000	because everything on the planet was bioluminescent.
489000	492000	And also, because they'd already done Little Green Men.
492000	494000	They wanted them to be blue.
494000	495000	Nice.
495000	497000	Yeah. So, overall, I have to say,
497000	499000	I like a movie that a lot of thought and energy
499000	501000	had been put into, and it was very clear
501000	503000	that a lot of work went into this,
503000	506000	and you could see it in the final production, so.
506000	509000	And that, and I wanted to punch that guy in the face.
509000	512000	Not the Marine.
512000	514000	The Colonel guy.
514000	516000	Yeah, because he actually, he's what I expected him to be.
516000	519000	I wanted no redemption out of him.
519000	521000	I'm not trying to spoil it,
521000	523000	and I know most of you have seen it.
523000	525000	I wanted no redemption out of him.
525000	527000	I wanted him to be a hard ass to the end, and he sure was.
527000	529000	But it was the corporate guy.
529000	533000	Because you could almost see him thinking about it.
533000	535000	And then, ooh, dollars.
535000	537000	So, and I've seen him in other stuff,
537000	539000	and I can't think of what.
539000	540000	That you gotta IMDB it.
540000	541000	Yeah.
541000	542000	So, yeah.
542000	544000	You might remember, I kind of came out before this movie,
544000	546000	and I was like, I just hope it tanks.
546000	548000	Like, it looks terrible from the trailer,
548000	550000	and James Cameron's kind of an arrogant ass,
550000	552000	and, you know, just after Titanic,
552000	554000	I just kind of wanted to see the movie tank.
554000	556000	So I went in with very low expectations.
556000	558000	Like, I was kind of like Dark Saga.
558000	559000	All right, what the hell.
559000	560000	I'll go.
560000	562000	I got three hours to kill.
562000	564000	Let's go see the damn movie.
564000	565000	I was wrong.
565000	566000	It was good.
566000	568000	It was a good movie.
568000	569000	Props to Cameron.
569000	570000	You did it again.
570000	572000	It was good.
572000	576000	Was it like OMG Oscar winning story and all this?
576000	577000	No.
577000	579000	I mean, the story you've kind of heard before,
579000	580000	but it's effective.
580000	582000	And I know here we are, a video game podcast,
582000	583000	talking about movies,
583000	585000	but I want to kind of bring this back to video games a little bit,
585000	587000	because honestly, I kind of thought the movie
587000	589000	was just a giant video game.
589000	592000	Like, the graphics were really good in Avatar.
592000	593000	You know, and that's kind of one of the things.
593000	595000	I was like, wow, the landscape is really pretty.
595000	599000	The way the Navi were done was really pretty,
599000	602000	and just everything about the movie was really, really pretty.
602000	603000	And so the game had great graphics.
603000	605000	And even the story, I got to be honest,
605000	607000	the story, without getting into spoilery,
607000	609000	I was really reminded of Final Fantasy VII.
609000	612000	There was a lot of tie-ins to me with Final Fantasy VII,
612000	613000	and you have to admit,
613000	616000	there was an epic boss battle at the end of the movie,
616000	617000	which is to be expected.
617000	618000	I really was epic.
618000	621000	Also, that guy, I actually remember him from My Name is Earl.
621000	623000	Ah, there you go.
623000	625000	So, it was very epic.
625000	627000	I think in some ways,
627000	630000	and this is going to sound like a much bigger compliment
630000	632000	than maybe the movie actually deserves,
632000	634000	but I actually think in some ways,
634000	637000	this movie is going to be like this generation's Wizard of Oz.
637000	639000	Like, because if you think about it,
639000	644000	The Wizard of Oz was actually not like that great of a movie,
644000	647000	but it's one of those ones we kind of all remember
647000	652000	because it was that musical that we all remember,
652000	653000	and it was that color.
653000	656000	It was the first color movie we all kind of remember.
656000	658000	Obviously, not all of us were alive when that movie first came out,
658000	660000	but it meant a lot for color.
660000	662000	And I think Avatar is going to be a lot of that for 3D,
662000	666000	even though it might not be the best or most original story in the world.
666000	669000	I think they're going to look back on this years from now
669000	671000	and say this is when 3D started being a big thing.
671000	675000	But I'm kind of, I'm a little worried about it
675000	678000	because I got to say, the 3D kind of bugged me.
678000	681000	Like, it wasn't, and I didn't think it was gimmicky or anything like that,
681000	684000	but the 3D bugged me because I had to take those glasses off
684000	687000	like every 10 minutes because I actually was like hurting my eyes.
687000	689000	And the same thing kind of happened when I was watching Up.
689000	693000	Like, I just, I can't sit there and do the 3D the whole time.
693000	695000	It's kind of a pain on my eyes.
695000	698000	So that was the only, I mean, it looked nice, don't get me wrong,
698000	700000	and I thought it definitely was kind of like something I haven't seen before,
700000	704000	but I'm a little worried because, you know, Consumer Electronics Show is this week,
704000	706000	obviously, bringing it back to gaming a little bit,
706000	709000	and although there was some gaming news we'll get to later a little bit,
709000	711000	it was more about the tech and the gadgets.
711000	712000	That's what CES is about.
712000	716000	One of the big, big things they're talking about this year, 3D television.
716000	720000	Is 3D TV is like the big thing, and this actually kind of worries me
720000	723000	because I'm like, I kind of don't want my TV to be 3D
723000	725000	because it hurts to watch.
725000	727000	I seriously doubt that's going to be the case
727000	731000	because it would require, you know, the glasses and everything.
731000	733000	They should have, it would probably be an option.
733000	736000	But they're talking about ESPN and 3D and all this stuff.
736000	740000	Like, I realize, you know, nobody's going to make me tune to that network,
740000	742000	but it's definitely kind of the wave of the future,
742000	745000	and I hope they find a way to make it less painful.
745000	749000	So, go to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
749000	753000	AlphaKananagram says, Sky said the game had good graphics. LMFAO.
753000	756000	Yeah, I mean, seriously, I found the movie to be very much like a video game.
756000	759000	It was kind of a cliche plot, but it was executed very well.
759000	761000	I'm not saying it was executed very, very well.
761000	763000	I actually think, what's her name?
763000	766000	That Zoe Saldana, the one that was Uhura in Star Trek.
766000	769000	She would, dude, she should like get nominated for an Oscar.
769000	772000	Honestly, I honestly mean that. She was amazingly good.
772000	773000	Yeah.
773000	776000	But, and Sigourney Weaver, oh my God, love her.
776000	779000	I do have to tell you, the movie scene, the full thing's going to be in the DVD release.
779000	780000	Could he?
780000	782000	But, I'm not going to praise all the actors
782000	784000	because I can't fucking stand Michelle Rodriguez.
784000	787000	I cannot stand her. She brought the movie down for me.
787000	790000	But at least she wasn't in a lot of scenes.
790000	792000	Yeah, she definitely was like a supporting actress.
792000	793000	Yeah.
793000	794000	Yeah.
794000	796000	But I'm just not a fan of her, so I, bleh.
796000	802000	You know that there cannot be a Cameron movie without the angry Hispanic chick.
802000	804000	You know what?
804000	806000	I don't think there was one in Titanic.
806000	809000	Yeah, but aliens high.
809000	812000	So, anyway, reading some of the comments from chat.
812000	815000	SSJ100Matt says, I wouldn't go that far.
815000	819000	It was okay, but I don't see it lasting the test of time like Wizard of Oz.
819000	821000	It's, I think it's too early to say.
821000	823000	Like, again, I don't think people are going to go back and go,
823000	826000	oh, this is like just a phenomenal fucking movie.
826000	827000	Like, The Lord of the Rings will be.
827000	829000	I think they're going to look back on that one time.
829000	831000	I don't know. I went back to The Wizard of Oz after a while
831000	834000	because I used to, you know, I used to like that movie
834000	838000	and I find it really grating on my ears now
838000	841000	and just a really annoying, awful movie.
841000	845000	So, I don't know if Wizard of Oz has, you know, lasted the test of time either
845000	849000	because you watch it and you're like, wow, this kind of sucks.
849000	853000	Now, however, The Return to Oz, I think that's a way better movie anyways
853000	855000	because there's no singing in it.
855000	857000	I think the singing really brought it down.
857000	861000	Well, Return to Oz was based off the books in particular.
861000	864000	As they should do some more movies based off the books.
864000	867000	SSJ100Matt in chat says also, I don't think the 3D added all that much to it.
867000	869000	It was nice without it.
869000	871000	I kind of agree. I think I would have still felt the same about the movie
871000	873000	had I seen it in 2D.
873000	876000	But 3D did give that little extra kick.
876000	881000	You know, that little extra wow factor that really brought the graphics,
881000	883000	so to speak, home.
883000	885000	Like, that planet was beautiful.
885000	887000	And I'm actually excited to play the game.
887000	888000	And sure enough, Loki managed to...
888000	890000	Not only did he get us free tickets to the movie.
890000	891000	Thank you very much, Loki. We appreciate it.
891000	894000	Now he scrounged up a copy of Avatar the Game on PlayStation 3.
894000	896000	So, Dark Soccer and I are going to kind of trade it back and forth
896000	898000	since I'm going to be traveling this next week.
898000	900000	She's going to borrow it and then I'm going to take it.
900000	902000	So, you're going to have a 3D TV because that is in 3D if you have a 3D TV?
902000	904000	That's what I hear. You know what? I'll pass anyway.
904000	907000	Well, no. I think that my TV is capable.
907000	909000	Do you have the glasses for it?
909000	911000	I stole the ones from the theater.
911000	915000	Yeah, but different TVs have different 3D...
915000	919000	Unless your TV supports real D, then those glasses will work with that.
919000	924000	If they don't, or if it doesn't, then you may need shutter glasses or something like that.
924000	928000	We've actually got shutter glasses for the...
928000	932000	Oh, crap. The Master System.
932000	936000	Well, speaking of 3D, my boyfriend bought Coraline on Blu-ray,
936000	940000	and that comes with the red and blue, I think, because we were watching it a little bit.
940000	942000	It's green and magenta.
942000	946000	I didn't watch the whole movie. I haven't seen the movie yet,
946000	948000	but he wanted to see a couple clips to see how it played out.
948000	952000	And it was okay, but again, my eyes just don't take well.
952000	955000	In the theater, though, the 3D in Coraline was awesome.
955000	958000	But they did the same type of thing they did in Avatar, right?
958000	960000	The real 3D, or whatever it's called, right?
960000	963000	Real D, yeah. I think real D would be the best option,
963000	965000	because, man, those shutter glasses are expensive.
965000	969000	They're like $200 a piece, and if you're gonna get some for your friends and stuff like that,
969000	975000	forget about it. But real D, man, those glasses are so damn cheap to manufacture,
975000	981000	it's almost as cheap as the red-blue glasses, but you don't have the color distortion in it.
981000	985000	Alright, so I know you're all joking that, hey, we're turning into movie lounge radio all of a sudden,
985000	989000	but hey, there's a reason we're talking about this, because Avatar has done so well
989000	994000	that I think, honestly, the CES, this 3D TV, Avatar's gonna be a big release.
994000	997000	You know they're gonna try to make it 3D somehow on its release.
997000	1002000	Whatever they do with the home version, whether it be the red-blue or the real D,
1002000	1005000	but you'd have to have a TV. I don't know what the hell they're gonna do.
1005000	1009000	And I think it will come over to games.
1009000	1014000	Where the movie goes, games will soon go, and this might be something that's in the PlayStation 4,
1014000	1018000	the Xbox 720, and whatever other hypothetical system you wanna come up with.
1018000	1024000	I just kinda hope, again, that they find a way to make it easier on the eyes,
1024000	1029000	and that they don't rely on it as a crutch, that it gets too gimmicky.
1029000	1033000	You know, it's gonna be the gimmick for the first year it comes out,
1033000	1036000	they're gonna overdo it with everything, and then they're gonna slack back off,
1036000	1040000	just like with everything else.
1040000	1042000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks. Enough movies.
1042000	1044000	Let's actually talk about the video games we've been playing this week.
1044000	1047000	Dark Soccer, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
1047000	1050000	Well, mostly watching Dan play Borderlands.
1050000	1057000	I played Lumines on Steam, and then was very disappointed to realize that Shining wasn't in it.
1057000	1060000	And, of course, Peggle.
1060000	1066000	I finally beat one of those crappy extra point levels, you know, that I was yelling at.
1066000	1069000	And once I did it, I actually managed to beat another one after that,
1069000	1073000	but now I'm on the million point level, and I'm like, oh, whatever.
1076000	1080000	Also, I've got Silent Hill, Shattered Memories, but I haven't had a chance to play it,
1080000	1083000	because, again, I haven't been able to get Dan's butt off of Borderlands.
1083000	1088000	And he hasn't got me Bayonetta yet, which makes me weep.
1088000	1090000	You've got to get him to get that for you.
1090000	1092000	All right.
1092000	1094000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1094000	1096000	Real quick, to go back to what we were talking about before,
1096000	1100000	remember how they were talking about 3D TV at CES?
1100000	1104000	Well, the format that they're kind of working towards is Realty, actually,
1104000	1106000	so that would be kind of cool.
1106000	1112000	And they're, I guess, partnering with Sony, JVC, Samsung, Toshiba, Panasonic, and DirecTV.
1112000	1117000	So, that would be the best way to go, I think,
1117000	1121000	because, like I said, glasses are cheap, not intrusive.
1121000	1123000	Anyways, so games.
1123000	1128000	I actually got to play some of the stuff I've been meaning to play and putting off for a while.
1128000	1131000	I finally played Borderlands, and it's awesome.
1131000	1133000	Very fun game.
1133000	1136000	I've actually played it for a few hours.
1136000	1140000	I'm only level seven right now, but I did finish killing Nineto,
1140000	1143000	which is one of the characters in the game.
1143000	1150000	And, I don't know, the game itself reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI with guns,
1150000	1155000	because a lot of the enemies and stuff, they have certain spawn points in the game,
1155000	1158000	and you see them kind of just wandering around and stuff like that,
1158000	1160000	like you would in Final Fantasy VII,
1160000	1163000	just without all the other people running around with you.
1163000	1169000	And you have kind of different zones you can kind of zone into to kill different creatures and whatnot.
1169000	1175000	And it just reminds me so much with the quests and the findings of Final Fantasy XI.
1175000	1178000	Although, at the same time, it's a little bit more like Diablo,
1178000	1182000	because there's a lot of, like, okay, you find these random chests on the ground,
1182000	1184000	you can open them up, and there's money there,
1184000	1187000	or the enemies drop ammo and money and all that fun stuff.
1187000	1189000	Plus, there's all the random weapons in the game,
1189000	1195000	since there's literally three-quarters of a million weapons in the game.
1195000	1198000	So there's all these different unique weapons.
1198000	1204000	It's got this pistol that sets things on fire, so that's pretty awesome.
1204000	1209000	But it's just really cool, and I'm really disappointed that it took me so long to play the game,
1209000	1212000	but I definitely will be playing it for a long time,
1212000	1214000	and probably will download the download content later on,
1214000	1216000	as soon as I get a little further in the game.
1216000	1218000	Must play the island of Dr. Ned.
1218000	1222000	It's all about shooting brains out of their skulls.
1222000	1223000	Seriously.
1223000	1224000	Awesome.
1224000	1226000	You guys are making me want to play this game, like, very badly.
1226000	1228000	Get it, Rob? Play it. I can't play it, you know.
1228000	1232000	When I talk about my gaming week, I'll tell you why I can't play Borderlands yet,
1232000	1234000	because I'm too distracted.
1234000	1237000	The other thing is, um, non-kind of gaming.
1237000	1239000	Well, I've also been playing Grand Theft Auto.
1239000	1241000	I actually played some Grand Theft Auto this weekend,
1241000	1243000	because I was trying to just play some more online games,
1243000	1246000	just with some other people other than my coworkers and stuff,
1246000	1249000	because I've been kicking the crap out of my coworkers a lot,
1249000	1252000	to the point where they're getting really frustrated with me,
1252000	1255000	and the people online that we play with get really frustrated with me,
1255000	1259000	and they end up dropping because I just kicked the crap out of them.
1259000	1263000	And, you know, not to sound like, oh, I'm the best person ever.
1263000	1268000	I doubt that I am, but this weekend, though, playing with just random games,
1268000	1271000	you know, other people hosting games, their settings, whatever they want to do,
1271000	1273000	I still kicked the crap out of everybody.
1273000	1274000	So modest.
1274000	1276000	And a lot of them dropped.
1276000	1279000	And there's even people that were blatantly cheating, you know,
1279000	1282000	using lag switches and turbo controllers and stuff like that,
1282000	1284000	and I still kicked the crap out of them.
1284000	1290000	So, I mean, I don't know what to do, and everybody keeps dropping.
1290000	1292000	I really hate that everybody drops out of the games.
1292000	1296000	I mean, seriously, just try a little bit.
1296000	1298000	You know, maybe you'll learn something, get a little bit better,
1298000	1303000	instead of just quitting because you just can't seem to kill somebody.
1303000	1304000	I don't know.
1304000	1305000	Whatever.
1305000	1310000	But, so, yeah, I've been working my way up the ranks.
1310000	1316000	Right now, I think I'm in the, I know I'm in the top 300 on Lost and Damned
1316000	1321000	out of ranked death matches, probably up 250 by now.
1321000	1323000	But I've been working my way up to number one,
1323000	1325000	so hopefully I'll hit that at some point.
1325000	1331000	I know I'm up there, whereas my other coworkers are in the 700s to 1,000s.
1331000	1335000	So I'm just looking for a challenge out there,
1335000	1339000	and I really hope that people that play online would stop dropping
1339000	1345000	because it's ridiculous and very frustrating.
1345000	1352000	And, let's see, other than Xbox 360 stuff, I worked on the cabinet a little bit more.
1352000	1357000	I played a little bit Tubin this week because Jim came over and he wanted to play Tubin.
1357000	1361000	So I tried that, and man, that's hard to control.
1361000	1364000	I forgot how hard that game was.
1364000	1365000	So that was kind of cool.
1365000	1369000	And then next week, I should be getting some Xbox 360 repair kits
1369000	1373000	for the Red Ring of Death stuff, mainly just because I didn't really want to send out.
1373000	1376000	I have six systems just waiting to be repaired,
1376000	1382000	and one of them I can actually send back to Microsoft, the other few of them.
1382000	1385000	I'm just going to try to repair real quick.
1385000	1389000	If it doesn't work, then oh well, I'll just send it out to somebody to repair it.
1389000	1393000	But I had one that I repaired, and it worked for a while.
1393000	1397000	So, you know, I'll give it a shot.
1397000	1409000	And I also got a, what is it, a Cyclops, a Cygnus 2 mod chip for one of my 360s.
1409000	1412000	So I'm going to play with that, assuming I can get it soldered on there.
1412000	1418000	Because, I don't know, I had good luck with my Wii mod chip.
1418000	1420000	I was able to solder that.
1420000	1426000	Not so much with my PSP when I tried modding that into the arcade cabinet.
1426000	1430000	So I'm 50-50 right now.
1430000	1434000	Maybe Dan can help you, because he repairs the pinball tables all the time.
1434000	1436000	He's really good with soldering.
1436000	1438000	I think I'm going to give it a go.
1438000	1441000	I don't think it'll be too difficult. I have to see how small the points are.
1441000	1444000	A PSP is damn hard.
1444000	1446000	Even with a magnifying glass, I couldn't see the points on there,
1446000	1448000	because they were so close together.
1448000	1451000	I think on a 360 board, it's a little bit more spread apart.
1451000	1453000	So it should be alright.
1453000	1456000	And they have crap on their board where nothing wants to solder to it anyway.
1456000	1458000	I don't know if it came up on last week's show,
1458000	1460000	because I think the exchange happened before the show.
1460000	1463000	But I gave Loki my old 360, the one that broke, for him to try to fix.
1463000	1466000	I hope it's one that comes out okay.
1466000	1469000	And I told Loki he could keep it if he fixes it, because I have a new one now.
1469000	1473000	So he could use it for his Grand Theft Auto death matches, work, whatever he's going to do with it.
1473000	1475000	Whatever machine he wants to build, I don't care.
1475000	1477000	Get rid of it is really what it is.
1477000	1479000	Literally, people keep giving me 360s.
1479000	1481000	They're all, hey, it's broken, I bought another one, here you go.
1481000	1483000	I'm like, awesome!
1483000	1488000	I'll tell you what, if you get one working, I'll totally buy a mod chip if you want to get rid of one.
1488000	1491000	What do you mean, buy a mod chip?
1491000	1495000	Like, if you get rid of any of them, then I'll mod it.
1495000	1498000	Well, it all depends on what firmware some of them are.
1498000	1501000	I know my sister's console, the one she was using,
1501000	1505000	if I could get that fixed, is an old enough firmware where I can run the mod chip on it.
1505000	1512000	The other one's not so sure because we were using those and they were pretty much updated.
1512000	1514000	So those may not work.
1514000	1516000	I just have to look at them.
1516000	1518000	But there may be one or two of them that might work.
1518000	1519000	At least one, I know.
1519000	1521000	So that's why I only got one mod chip.
1521000	1525000	Well, yeah, I'll find.
1525000	1526000	Alright.
1526000	1528000	Anyway, my gaming week, I played a lot.
1528000	1531000	A lot, a lot of stuff this week, so let me try to run down it really quick.
1531000	1534000	I played off a listener tip last week.
1534000	1535000	It came in on Twitter.
1535000	1538000	Somebody told me there was this game on the Windows Live,
1538000	1541000	the Games for Windows Live that's free if you download it.
1541000	1543000	Tinker is the name of the game.
1543000	1544000	And I played it.
1544000	1546000	And when we brought it up on the show last week,
1546000	1548000	we were talking about how the game has achievements
1548000	1550000	and we weren't sure how it interfaces with Xbox Live.
1550000	1553000	Dude, it interfaces really good with Xbox Live.
1553000	1556000	Those achievements do count towards your gamer score.
1556000	1559000	It will even come up, like if I look on my recent games on the Xbox 360,
1559000	1560000	I see Tinker.
1560000	1562000	I see a card for it with all the achievements.
1562000	1564000	And I can look at it just like as any other game on my 360.
1564000	1566000	I kind of thought that was cool.
1566000	1568000	And then when I was actually playing the game,
1568000	1572000	you could access like an Xbox Live-ish type of interface
1572000	1575000	where I could see my friends that were online playing Xbox Live.
1575000	1577000	And I'm sure if they were looking at me,
1577000	1579000	they would see me playing the Tinker game.
1579000	1583000	As far as Tinker itself, okay, it's a free game.
1583000	1584000	And that's pretty much what it's worth.
1584000	1589000	I mean, it's a puzzle game that's not very different than things we've seen before.
1589000	1592000	It kind of takes the scene of like a child's room
1592000	1595000	and kind of takes this 3D isometric approach
1595000	1598000	to get the robot from point A to B, but you have to use switches.
1598000	1601000	And there's toy guns and dominoes and dice and things that get in the way.
1601000	1604000	Eh, it's free. It's worth just playing for a little bit.
1604000	1606000	Hey, if you're an achievement score whore,
1606000	1609000	go download it for like 30 gamerscore pretty easy
1609000	1611000	just by beating the tutorial levels.
1611000	1613000	It's not that hard to do.
1613000	1617000	So, you know, it was cute, but I wouldn't have paid a lot of money for it
1617000	1618000	because it's a puzzle we've seen before.
1618000	1621000	And I don't like the 3D thing because in later levels
1621000	1624000	they're like, you have to turn the camera around to be able to see everything.
1624000	1627000	But when you turn the camera around, it's not very seamless.
1627000	1631000	It's just kind of like flips the screen 90 degrees by redeploying.
1631000	1635000	Like it doesn't actually show the screen rotating like I think we've come to expect.
1635000	1639000	It just kind of switches the display to, you know, turning it 90 degrees.
1639000	1640000	A little bit disappointed with that.
1640000	1644000	So, you know, whatever. It's free, so why not?
1644000	1648000	But I'm hearing, though, if you kind of run an older OS
1648000	1651000	or you might have some problems with a game for Windows Live.
1651000	1653000	So, there you go.
1653000	1657000	I spent a little bit of time just playing some various Xbox Live arcade games
1657000	1661000	because there were some that I hadn't really played a whole lot of.
1661000	1664000	Like Sonic 2 and R-Type, a lot of the classically redone ones.
1664000	1667000	I have to admit, R-Type, when you play it in crazy camera mode
1667000	1669000	where it's all like that tilted 3D, it's kind of cool.
1669000	1671000	Hard to play, but cool.
1671000	1676000	Isn't, though, just the remixed versions, the HD versions?
1676000	1678000	I was pretty impressed. Yeah, it's nice.
1678000	1680000	But R-Type is still fucking hard.
1680000	1682000	I forgot to say the other game that we had going on.
1682000	1683000	What's that?
1683000	1685000	Was Raiden 4, and you should give that a try.
1685000	1686000	It actually was really fun.
1686000	1687000	I will.
1687000	1692000	Also, I played quite a bit of Bayonetta on the 360.
1692000	1695000	Checked out the game this week, and I love it.
1695000	1699000	It's great. It's over the top. It's excess.
1699000	1701000	We were kind of watching the introduction movie,
1701000	1704000	just laughing and laughing, because it's so over the top.
1704000	1707000	It's so unnecessary, but great.
1707000	1709000	I can't even explain it.
1709000	1711000	The game is a bit of a button masher.
1711000	1713000	I mean, you just kind of punch, punch, kick, kick, dodge,
1713000	1716000	but I don't think it really has to be.
1716000	1719000	If you kind of know what you're doing,
1719000	1722000	you do have to time your dodges right.
1722000	1725000	You do have to perform certain types of moves at certain points,
1725000	1727000	but you can kind of get away, especially in the first few levels,
1727000	1729000	of doing a bunch of button mashing.
1729000	1730000	Keep in mind, I'm also playing on normal.
1730000	1734000	I think the easier modes are kind of brought down to a point
1734000	1737000	where you really can just, like, slam on one button,
1737000	1738000	and you do all sorts of tricks.
1738000	1741000	But in the end, I kind of felt that the game is rewarding,
1741000	1742000	and there was a lot more depth to it
1742000	1744000	than I was getting the impression from from the demo.
1744000	1748000	I honestly have to say, this is one of the better games I've played on the 360.
1748000	1749000	I am having that much fun with it.
1749000	1753000	It's fun. It's excess. It's over the top. It's stupid.
1753000	1755000	It's what a video game should be.
1755000	1760000	I think it's great, and there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheek humor in it.
1760000	1763000	There's references to other Sega games in it.
1763000	1767000	I love the fact that, and I'm not really spoiling too much,
1767000	1769000	because this is in the first two minutes of the game,
1769000	1771000	when they're kind of doing the credits,
1771000	1773000	all the names of the people are on tombstones,
1773000	1775000	and then the director's name came up, right?
1775000	1777000	Same guy that did, like, Devil May Cry and all that,
1777000	1780000	and it opens with somebody peeing on his grave.
1780000	1784000	Like, what a good, like, tongue-in-cheek, not-taking-yourself-seriously type of thing.
1784000	1790000	I had a lot of fun with the game, and many lols were had, and I want to play more of it.
1790000	1794000	The only really downside is that I didn't notice, like, any type of, like,
1794000	1797000	multiplayer or how it really interfaced with live.
1797000	1802000	I mean, I guess there's leaderboards and stuff, but I had a really good time with it.
1802000	1803000	It's very arcade-y.
1803000	1808000	If you like arcade games, like, I almost expect I should be putting in a quarter to play this game.
1808000	1810000	Some of the boss battles are quite epic.
1810000	1813000	But, yeah, it's a little bit of a button masher, but a lot of arcade games were.
1813000	1817000	So if you like those quarter-munching arcade games, I think you will like this.
1817000	1821000	And, um, yeah, actdeft in our chatroom chat that orangehonestradio.com says,
1821000	1823000	Bayonetta has rings, like Sonic the Hedgehog rings.
1823000	1826000	They're called Halos, but yeah, they work just like the Sonic rings, really.
1826000	1831000	I totally see this as being, like, the diva of the Xbox.
1831000	1833000	Well, keep in mind it's multiplatform.
1833000	1835000	They're on PS3 as well.
1835000	1837000	The diva of the game world, then.
1837000	1841000	It would be a tragedy if there is no sequel announced to this game.
1841000	1844000	I really hope they do a sequel in the same vein.
1844000	1846000	And I'm not even, like, that far into it.
1846000	1847000	I'm only a couple hours in.
1847000	1849000	I need to play more.
1849000	1851000	I just haven't had a lot of time this weekend.
1851000	1855000	Because I was playing another game, and it's one I don't think I can talk about,
1855000	1858000	because there was a non-disclosure agreement, I clicked through really quickly without reading.
1858000	1864000	I will just say that it's a very popular closed beta that's going on right now for an upcoming PC game.
1864000	1866000	But I can't tell you what game it is.
1866000	1870000	And I would not base my review off a game off a closed beta.
1870000	1875000	But I thought that this game, it's a game that there's kind of a lot of hype behind it.
1875000	1880000	And I, including myself, I've hyped this game up before previously.
1880000	1884000	I'm not sure the game lived up 100% to the hype.
1884000	1888000	But there were certain things about it that I really liked.
1888000	1890000	And there were certain parts of the game I was kind of like,
1890000	1893000	Oh, this is slow. Get on with it.
1893000	1895000	I'm not having any fun right now.
1895000	1897000	Just kind of, let's get past this part.
1897000	1899000	Let's blow shit up and move on.
1899000	1907000	So, however, one other thing I want to say about it is that PC games, you know what?
1907000	1910000	They really have these demanding system requirements.
1910000	1912000	I was not able to play this game on my own computer.
1912000	1915000	And my own computer is only like a year old.
1915000	1917000	I had to go play it on my boyfriend's computer,
1917000	1920000	because he has a better system than I do and a better video card and all that.
1920000	1922000	And even still, it was a little bit choppy.
1922000	1924000	However, I have to remember in a closed beta,
1924000	1927000	sometimes these things are sending data to the server all the time.
1927000	1929000	It might be running a little bit slow on purpose.
1929000	1931000	So I can't, again, base a review off of it.
1931000	1934000	But I'm not as excited as I was.
1934000	1937000	I probably will still pick up the full version just to check it out.
1937000	1941000	But at the same time, I still have WoW and all these other games to play
1941000	1943000	and all this other stuff.
1943000	1945000	So, we'll see.
1945000	1949000	Also, they've got to fix the interface in this particular game I'm thinking of,
1949000	1952000	because it's a game where you can chat with other players,
1952000	1954000	because that's the type of game it is.
1954000	1957000	I couldn't stay on top of chat, because the box is so frickin' small,
1957000	1959000	like no text fits in it at all.
1959000	1962000	So, there you go.
1962000	1964000	Anyhow, that was my thoughts on that.
1964000	1968000	More thoughts on that when the beta is unleashed to the public,
1968000	1971000	which is happening next week, which is very good news.
1971000	1973000	All right, let's see.
1973000	1975000	That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.
1975000	1977000	Let's move on to a little bit of housekeeping news.
1977000	1980000	Okay, live listeners, I have a little bit of bad news, guys.
1980000	1983000	We're not going to be live for the next two weeks in our normal time slot,
1983000	1987000	and it's really all my fault, and I apologize for that.
1987000	1989000	Next week is a three-day week for a lot of folks in America,
1989000	1991000	because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
1991000	1993000	I'm actually taking a trip to Seattle,
1993000	1995000	and I am not flying back till Monday,
1995000	1996000	so I won't even be here at all that weekend.
1996000	1999000	So, we will be taking next week off completely.
1999000	2001000	There will be no show next week at all.
2001000	2006000	There might be a best of that hits the feed if it's done in time,
2006000	2008000	so stay tuned to our podcast feed.
2008000	2012000	However, the week after on the 24th, again, I won't be here,
2012000	2014000	but that's just because I have Sunday evening plans,
2014000	2017000	and I'll admit, because it is a little bit gaming-related, actually,
2017000	2020000	I'm going to see Utada Hikaru live at one of her shows.
2020000	2022000	She's in San Francisco on the 24th,
2022000	2024000	and I forgot it was a Sunday when I bought the tickets,
2024000	2028000	but what a rare opportunity to see a Japanese superstar in a small venue.
2028000	2031000	She's playing the film more, which is not a very big venue at all,
2031000	2032000	so I'm going to go see that.
2032000	2034000	Sorry, I'm not going to apologize for it,
2034000	2036000	because I'm really looking forward to it,
2036000	2040000	but we're actually going to take kind of a bad situation for the show
2040000	2042000	and make it good, because for a long time,
2042000	2046000	we've been promising an earlier show for our overseas listeners,
2046000	2048000	so what we're going to do on the 24th,
2048000	2050000	we're going to tape a show at 10 a.m.,
2050000	2053000	which will be 6 o'clock Greenwich time,
2053000	2055000	which is in the same time zone as London.
2055000	2058000	I have to make sure that's okay with all games.
2058000	2059000	That's not official yet.
2059000	2062000	I have to run that by the powers that be at all games.
2062000	2064000	However, since there's no other live show on that early,
2064000	2066000	I don't see it being a problem,
2066000	2070000	but I just have to make sure all the sign-offs are approved on that,
2070000	2071000	so stay tuned to our Twitter,
2071000	2075000	but we are looking at doing the overseas show that Sunday.
2075000	2077000	Also, if you just want to get up early,
2077000	2078000	if you happen to be up at 10 o'clock Pacific,
2078000	2080000	or that would only be about 1 in the afternoon Eastern,
2080000	2082000	we will be doing a show that week,
2082000	2084000	and that will still go to the podcast feed as always,
2084000	2087000	so there you go.
2087000	2089000	Let's see.
2089000	2100000	Sorry, I apologize for the dead air.
2100000	2102000	I'm just trying to catch up on everything going on.
2102000	2103000	They're talking about the game
2103000	2105000	because they all know what I'm talking about,
2105000	2108000	but I don't want to say just because.
2108000	2110000	There's been previews of it everywhere left and right,
2110000	2112000	but it's just one of those things I just would rather not
2112000	2117000	without me knowing exactly what I can and can't say.
2117000	2118000	It looks like that best of might be ready.
2118000	2121000	We just have to get our intros done for it, so we'll see.
2121000	2124000	Anyway, yes, so no show next week at all.
2124000	2125000	It won't be on the podcast feed or anything,
2125000	2127000	although there might be a best of,
2127000	2128000	which if it's a best of,
2128000	2130000	it's not going to be stuff you've heard
2130000	2131000	in the past couple weeks.
2131000	2135000	It's going to be stuff from the first couple years of OLR.
2135000	2137000	It's old shit, so to many of you,
2137000	2138000	you won't have heard it before,
2138000	2140000	so it'll be like a new show.
2140000	2142000	Then, of course, we'll do the early show,
2142000	2145000	10 a.m. Pacific next Sunday pending,
2145000	2148000	but that would, of course, be six o'clock Greenwich time
2148000	2150000	for those of you overseas,
2150000	2152000	so those of you who should be excited about that
2152000	2154000	because we've been promising that for quite a while.
2154000	2155000	All right, that's it for housekeeping.
2155000	2158000	Of course, twitter.com slash OLR,
2158000	2160000	facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio join us there.
2160000	2162000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2162000	2164000	Loki, what was some of the big news this week?
2164000	2166000	Well, there's lots of stuff this week.
2166000	2168000	We're going to start things off talking a little bit
2168000	2171000	about Microsoft's Game Room,
2171000	2176000	and basically, I don't know if you would call this
2176000	2179000	their answer to home.
2179000	2181000	I don't really know if it's that.
2181000	2182000	You may remember a while back,
2182000	2184000	we talked about a survey that went out
2184000	2188000	that kind of talked about a place where you'd be able
2188000	2192000	to walk your avatars around and play arcade games.
2192000	2193000	Well, that's what this is.
2193000	2195000	They're going to have a bunch of different arcade games.
2195000	2197000	Some of the stuff they showed off
2197000	2203000	were, I know that there was different Atari 2600 games on there.
2203000	2209000	They had other things including like, you know, Centipede.
2209000	2211000	I'm trying to remember the other games that were on there
2211000	2215000	that were pretty cool.
2215000	2216000	But basically, they have all these...
2216000	2217000	There's some television stuff too.
2217000	2218000	Yeah, television.
2218000	2221000	There's some Konami games on there.
2221000	2223000	You know, all sorts of fun stuff.
2223000	2224000	Here we go.
2224000	2228000	Asteroids, Atari Football, Lunar Lander,
2228000	2233000	Millipede, Outlaw, Pitfall, Red Baron, Road Fighter,
2233000	2237000	Scramble, Tempest, all that kind of stuff that you would...
2237000	2239000	Say I picked up at least two games there
2239000	2241000	that I've already bought on Xbox Live before.
2241000	2242000	Scramble and Tempest.
2242000	2244000	So what's going to be unique about this is
2244000	2246000	you're going to be able to get your own gaming space
2246000	2248000	basically in these areas.
2248000	2250000	You'll be able to customize little rooms
2250000	2251000	with a different theme,
2251000	2253000	what games you want in there,
2253000	2256000	what other wall ornaments and whatnot
2256000	2260000	you want to stick in there.
2260000	2262000	Then they're also going to have games for purchase.
2262000	2268000	Since this is going to be available on Xbox 360 and on PC,
2268000	2269000	they're going to have different things you can do.
2269000	2273000	For example, you can purchase a game for 400 Microsoft points
2273000	2276000	or $5 that will basically license the game
2276000	2280000	for unlimited play on Xbox 360 and PC.
2280000	2281000	If you don't want to pay that,
2281000	2285000	you can spend $3 or 240 Microsoft points
2285000	2288000	and get you a virtual arcade cabinet on one platform
2288000	2291000	at either Xbox 360 or PC,
2291000	2293000	probably the option I'll be going with.
2293000	2297000	And then also for people that want to just spend lots of money
2297000	2300000	or just... I don't really know why you'd do this,
2300000	2305000	but for the old retro type of 40 Microsoft points or 50 cents
2305000	2310000	will allow you to get you two quarters worth of playtime
2310000	2314000	on select titles for the authentic arcade experience, they call it.
2314000	2317000	And the game room itself is actually being developed
2317000	2319000	by the third-party studio Chrome Studios,
2319000	2322000	who are behind Viva Pinata Party Animals,
2322000	2325000	Star Wars Republic Heroes, among many other things.
2325000	2329000	They're planning on starting the service with 30 original arcade titles
2329000	2333000	with 1,000 planned for the next three years.
2333000	2337000	And also they're going to be available from a variety of publishers,
2337000	2339000	including Atari, Activision, and television.
2339000	2341000	And Konami.
2341000	2346000	And apparently there's some more studios involved with it as well.
2346000	2349000	They're going to have...
2349000	2351000	They're going to be presented in 1080p,
2351000	2354000	which I don't know why you'd do that, because they're old retro games.
2354000	2356000	Big fucking deal, yeah.
2356000	2357000	They're going to have support for...
2357000	2359000	Well, they'll look sharp.
2359000	2362000	I mean, let's face it, if you hook up those old systems to the TV,
2362000	2364000	the TVs now are not... I mean, if you even can,
2364000	2367000	TVs now can't... some of those systems can't even hook up to them.
2367000	2371000	You know, they'll look sharp, that's for sure.
2371000	2374000	Yeah. They'll support multiplayer for up to two players,
2374000	2378000	as well as cross-platform leaderboards and achievements.
2378000	2383000	And apparently that's launching this spring, so relatively soon.
2383000	2385000	And the thing, though, about it, though,
2385000	2390000	is you can't freely walk around the game room like you can with home.
2390000	2392000	It's basically your avatars are just there.
2392000	2394000	At least when they're showing it off,
2394000	2396000	they don't have the collision detection and everything done yet.
2396000	2399000	So I don't know if you're going to be able to walk around just aimlessly and stuff,
2399000	2401000	but right now you kind of switch from room to room,
2401000	2403000	and there's different arcade games you can play.
2403000	2406000	The thing I don't like about this is if I have to purchase the games
2406000	2408000	I've already purchased before again,
2408000	2410000	because now it's going to have these other features.
2410000	2413000	I think if you have... you know, say you bought Frogger or something like that,
2413000	2415000	you know, on Xbox Live Arcade,
2415000	2418000	you should be able to have your Frogger arcade cabinet in the game.
2418000	2421000	It's probably not going to work that way, but hey, probably not.
2421000	2424000	You know, and it's... at least it's only three bucks.
2424000	2426000	That's not too bad.
2426000	2429000	What do you think about the whole fact that you can play it on your PC, though,
2429000	2430000	if you pay five bucks?
2430000	2432000	Or I guess you get, what, three dollars for one platform,
2432000	2434000	five dollars for both platforms?
2434000	2437000	You know, PC for me, it's really a hard sale
2437000	2439000	because I have a MAME cabinet,
2439000	2443000	and sadly enough, you know, MAME ROMs are really easy to find,
2443000	2446000	and especially stuff that old can run on anything.
2446000	2448000	I mean, anything.
2448000	2451000	A crappy netbook, a crappy PC from like eight years ago
2451000	2455000	will still run, you know, those ROMs just fine.
2455000	2458000	But no EP in this competition if you do it that way
2458000	2461000	because the whole leaderboards, medals, and all this stuff, right?
2461000	2463000	I don't know. It doesn't matter.
2463000	2467000	But, see, I don't know if I'm really going to be into this
2467000	2470000	because, like I said, I have MAME,
2470000	2473000	so why should I spend the money on this?
2473000	2476000	I mean, yeah, I get achievement points, but, you know,
2476000	2480000	I kind of got over the whole achievement point whoring stuff
2480000	2485000	because it's just, you know, the cost to buy games and stuff
2485000	2488000	just to get achievement points, it's just, it's not worth it.
2488000	2490000	Well, this is their way of legitimizing MAME, really.
2490000	2492000	I mean, they're trying to, you know,
2492000	2495000	MAME is still not legal, folks. You're not supposed to have it.
2495000	2497000	Well, let me put it this way, okay?
2497000	2501000	Here's one way at least they'll have a step up above home.
2501000	2504000	There's not going to be fucking lines for games.
2504000	2507000	I don't have to like, you know, walk up to an arcade machine and go,
2507000	2510000	I'm sorry, you can't play this game right now because there's other people playing it.
2510000	2516000	That's retarded when it comes to, you know, an online network like that.
2516000	2519000	I mean, come on, you're launching a program.
2519000	2522000	I understand that, you know, there's a fictional arcade game here,
2522000	2524000	but, dude, what the hell?
2524000	2527000	Why should I have to wait to play a game?
2527000	2530000	You know, Microsoft, well, let me ask Dark Soccer
2530000	2532000	because I know she's a classic gaming enthusiast.
2532000	2535000	What do you think about this whole game room thing?
2535000	2537000	I like it. I mean, it'd be great to have on Xbox
2537000	2540000	because I do go back and play old stuff.
2540000	2543000	I don't think I would necessarily do it as much on PC.
2543000	2547000	I mean, I think it's nice, especially for people who were into, you know,
2547000	2550000	the classic gaming, like, what was that rental thing that you did, GameTap?
2550000	2552000	Yeah, GameTap, yeah.
2552000	2555000	You know, and I've pulled a few stuff off of Steam, like I play Loom,
2555000	2557000	but that's really it.
2557000	2560000	I wonder if we'll see any, like, new controllers and stuff.
2560000	2562000	Like, for one, they need to fix a D-pad.
2562000	2564000	I mean, they've needed to fix a D-pad since day one.
2564000	2568000	But two, it'd be kind of neat to see, like, a trackball or something like that
2568000	2571000	that's kind of hooked up to the analog or something
2571000	2573000	where you could, you know, do some of the games.
2573000	2575000	Like, I know they had Crystal Castles on there.
2575000	2577000	That's one of their launch games, yeah.
2577000	2580000	And see, the other thing, too, is that I have a lot of these games
2580000	2584000	on the classic systems, and I do have the right controllers for them.
2584000	2587000	And I admit it, not everyone's going to have everything,
2587000	2591000	that everyone's, you know, got the vault or has been as nuts as Dan
2591000	2593000	and I have been about collecting the stuff.
2593000	2599000	But me personally, I don't have a legitimate need to do the extra spending on it.
2599000	2600000	I don't.
2600000	2603000	And the other thing I think also, too, that people have been complaining about
2603000	2607000	is, like, why should I pay $3 a game for these old Atari games
2607000	2610000	when I could just get a flashback for, like, 20 bucks
2610000	2613000	and it's got, like, 40 games on there?
2613000	2616000	There's also the community feature, I think, that has to be pointed out
2616000	2618000	is the fact that, you know, you set up your game room
2618000	2621000	so that your friends can come kind of to your game room and play the games.
2621000	2623000	They haven't said, do they get to play them for free
2623000	2625000	or do they still have to pay, like, the quarters or what's the deal?
2625000	2626000	Or are they playing demos?
2626000	2628000	Yeah, are they doing demos? What's the deal?
2628000	2629000	I mean, they haven't really given us the details there,
2629000	2632000	but there certainly is that whole idea of building up a collection,
2632000	2635000	which is your game room, and kind of checking out what other people have.
2635000	2639000	And with a thousand planned games, I mean, there's certainly going to be that element of,
2639000	2641000	oh, you have never played this game before?
2641000	2642000	Come to my game room and look at it real quick.
2642000	2644000	You know what they need to do, and this will be hilarious,
2644000	2648000	is have these trophies that you can earn or whatever achievements
2648000	2650000	with, like, little trophies that you can earn for your game room,
2650000	2652000	and have it so you can display your trophies,
2652000	2656000	and be home to the whole trophy display.
2656000	2658000	Well, I want to get back to that point in a minute,
2658000	2661000	but let me go to this real quick in our chat room, chat.orangetonstrategy.com.
2661000	2665000	Tigerclaw in our chat says, why not have it so you can view the game as a spectator?
2665000	2666000	Think of it like this.
2666000	2669000	You're at the arcade and there's a bunch of people playing the same game that you want to play.
2669000	2672000	You look over their shoulders and watch the person in front play that game.
2672000	2676000	And GS68 says, yeah, watching someone kick ass at so-and-so game in person
2676000	2678000	is better than watching a video on YouTube.
2678000	2683000	Imagine if you could go into game room and watch somebody try to do a big Donkey Kong score.
2683000	2685000	Well, obviously, that wouldn't be one of the games, because it's a Nintendo game.
2685000	2689000	But, you know, hypothetically, do one of these games, you know, and try to go for a huge high score,
2689000	2692000	which, by the way, should also be pointed out in that game room.
2692000	2693000	There are certain games they're never going to have,
2693000	2695000	because, like, Nintendo did some of those old arcade games,
2695000	2699000	and, you know, there's just other publishers that probably are never going to let Microsoft have their stuff.
2699000	2702000	But they have a pretty good collection, I think, so far.
2702000	2705000	I think there's still a lot to be determined, although we are getting some details.
2705000	2709000	You know, one of these videos, one of the guys that was hawking the game room says
2709000	2712000	that the noises you hear in the background of the arcade
2712000	2716000	is dynamically generated based on the games that are in your game room.
2716000	2721000	So if you have joust, you'll hear joust noises as part of that.
2721000	2727000	Well, you know, actually, that idea was used in something else that Dan showed me before.
2727000	2730000	And I don't want to, I know it wasn't related to me in particular,
2730000	2734000	but there's this guy who did a CG arcade.
2734000	2740000	And actually had gone around and recorded the games in action,
2740000	2744000	as well as the games, like their splash screens and that type of thing, the tracked modes,
2744000	2749000	and then had them running so that as you moved through the CG version of this arcade,
2749000	2752000	you were hearing things as you passed along, you know.
2752000	2756000	So I think that's going to be great. I'm really going to like that.
2756000	2759000	Of course, I think that you should also have the option of turning them off.
2759000	2760000	You know, because sometimes...
2760000	2762000	You might. We don't know. Usually they're not going to advertise,
2762000	2765000	but you can turn this off. They don't really demo that, you know.
2765000	2769000	But, I mean, but back to it, I think that that's a nice touch.
2769000	2770000	Some comments from our chatroom.
2770000	2773000	MacDeaf says, Sky, you can play a game in the game room like a real arcade
2773000	2775000	for 40 Microsoft points for one game.
2775000	2778000	I heard it was two games for four, because it's two quarters, but I don't know.
2778000	2780000	I mean, we'll see the specifics soon.
2780000	2784000	But, yeah, I mean, there's two different pricing methodologies.
2784000	2787000	If you think, oh, this is a game I'm only going to play once,
2787000	2791000	you can only spend 40 Microsoft points, play it once, and that's it.
2791000	2797000	I find that interesting pricing mechanic to be an interesting kind of change about this.
2797000	2802000	SJ100Matt says, can we put a Microsoft space buck token on machines to play next?
2802000	2804000	I don't think you're going to have the line there.
2804000	2806000	It's going to be your own thing.
2806000	2808000	Here's my honest thought about game room,
2808000	2810000	and I've kind of been processing this all week, because, you know,
2810000	2814000	as a classic gaming enthusiast, I am a little bit excited about game room.
2814000	2818000	Yes, I could do all this stuff on Mania, but I really like the community ideas,
2818000	2820000	and I have friends that are going to be really into this,
2820000	2824000	and I see myself having competitions for high scores on certain games in game room.
2824000	2826000	I see this happening.
2826000	2828000	But here's the interesting thing about it.
2828000	2830000	We've said this a lot on Orange Andrea.
2830000	2833000	One thing Microsoft does very well, because we've watched them kind of grow.
2833000	2836000	When we first started this show, I think the Xbox was just coming out.
2836000	2837000	It was 2002.
2837000	2843000	Microsoft has become very good at taking other people's ideas and making them better.
2843000	2845000	It's part of their business.
2845000	2848000	And the interesting thing about game room, guys, think about it.
2848000	2850000	This is not only a rip-off of Nintendo.
2850000	2852000	Well, I shouldn't say rip-off.
2852000	2854000	It's not only inspired by Nintendo.
2854000	2856000	It's inspired by Sony.
2856000	2859000	Dude, this is Virtual Console and home.
2859000	2862000	This is Microsoft's way of one-upping both of those.
2862000	2865000	What has everybody been asking for for Virtual Console?
2865000	2868000	I should be able to play it online with my friends in, like, a two-player mode.
2868000	2871000	Guess what? You can do that with game room.
2871000	2874000	I think the games in Virtual Console should have some HD effects
2874000	2876000	and should have leaderboards in them
2876000	2878000	and should have achievements in them.
2878000	2880000	Guess what? Game room is going to do that for these games.
2880000	2883000	I think home should have a fucking point to it.
2883000	2887000	That I load up my games seamlessly through the home interface.
2887000	2890000	Or that if I earn things in games, I'll be able to show it off.
2890000	2892000	Guess what? Game room is going to do that.
2892000	2897000	Game room has kind of taken all these ideas that the community wanted from Virtual Console
2897000	2899000	and the things that community wanted from home
2899000	2901000	and put it into this game room.
2901000	2903000	I think it's kind of interesting.
2903000	2907000	Now, I don't think game room is as close to home
2907000	2911000	because I still think there's other stuff that Sony Home kind of will do and does
2911000	2913000	that's much different than game room.
2913000	2918000	But I think game room is what we all thought home would be, in a way.
2918000	2921000	Even though, yes, it's very important to point out,
2921000	2924000	you're not going to be able to walk very fluidly through it.
2924000	2928000	No, so far. That was just being what they were showing off at CES, they said,
2928000	2931000	because they don't have the collision detection stuff worked out yet.
2931000	2933000	This thing is coming up out in the spring.
2933000	2935000	I don't see it suddenly...
2935000	2938000	Well, spring for Microsoft is anywhere between, you know...
2938000	2939000	It could be May, yeah.
2939000	2944000	It's basically, you know, April and May, so who knows?
2944000	2946000	Yeah, SSG100Matt says,
2946000	2948000	Simpsons in X-Men Arcade!
2948000	2950000	I know you might be kind of messing around,
2950000	2954000	but dude, imagine it if X-Men Arcade did show up in game room
2954000	2957000	and you could play it online with six people.
2957000	2959000	I mean, that's going to be huge if that happens.
2959000	2962000	I mean, the Ninja Turtle games are pretty popular, right?
2962000	2965000	The Ninja Turtle arcade game was one of Microsoft's best sellers.
2965000	2968000	Tons of people were playing that online, probably still are.
2968000	2973000	Black Wolf says, he's going so far as to say it'll come out during E3.
2973000	2974000	Possibly.
2974000	2979000	Or like, Daytona.
2979000	2982000	The racing controller and stuff, that'd be awesome.
2982000	2985000	Alright, so anyway, I guess more to see on game room,
2985000	2987000	but I'm excited at the possibilities.
2987000	2989000	Dude, as a classic gaming enthusiast,
2989000	2991000	I don't mind that they're trying to legitimize MAME
2991000	2993000	and give us a reason to pay for it.
2993000	2996000	And I would not buy every game, hell no.
2996000	2998000	But there are some games I remember quite fondly that,
2998000	3001000	yeah, I might drop five bucks to play them on my PC.
3001000	3003000	Because when you say play it on my PC, I think,
3003000	3005000	ooh, my laptop and everywhere it goes with me
3005000	3007000	that I have an internet connection, which is when I travel.
3007000	3009000	That will be kind of cool to have on the road.
3009000	3012000	And compete in the leaderboards and the medals and all that,
3012000	3014000	and that's something I can't really do in MAME.
3014000	3017000	So it's not that much.
3017000	3020000	Five bucks is not that much.
3020000	3023000	So, anyhow, we'll see what happens.
3023000	3026000	Moving on to another classic game, getting a redo.
3026000	3028000	Mega Man 10 is on its way.
3028000	3030000	And Mega Man 10, of course, they've been trying to keep
3030000	3033000	the eight robot master names a secret, but guess what?
3033000	3036000	The game is playable on the CES floor.
3036000	3038000	Well, I guess not on the floor, but maybe by appointment.
3038000	3040000	Either way, the game is showing at CES.
3040000	3043000	And although they are asking journalists not to name the bosses
3043000	3046000	and not to show video of it, I guess there was a German video
3046000	3049000	that showed up that it accidentally snuck in there.
3049000	3051000	Probably they didn't intend to do it,
3051000	3053000	but you know the bright-eyed fans found it.
3053000	3057000	And now the names of the boss monsters in Mega Man 10 have shown up.
3057000	3059000	So, of course, you already knew about Sheep Man,
3059000	3061000	which I thought was kind of funny,
3061000	3064000	but you will also be able to fight Blade Man, Solar Man,
3064000	3070000	Chill Man, Commando Man, Nitro Man, Strike Man, and Pump Man.
3070000	3074000	And when I hear Pump Man, I'm sorry, I think about the shoes, the pumps.
3074000	3076000	No female characters, then?
3076000	3079000	Not yet, but keep in mind that's only eight, right?
3079000	3082000	That's eight. Well, no, I guess there's only eight on the screen,
3082000	3083000	because I'm thinking nine.
3083000	3086000	So, no, it doesn't look like there's going to be a woman in this one,
3086000	3088000	although anything can happen.
3088000	3091000	Maybe Dr. Wily is now, you know, to check.
3091000	3093000	Who knows? Anything is possible.
3093000	3094000	No, I guess that's interesting.
3094000	3097000	Yeah, we had Splash Woman last time, which was the first female boss ever,
3097000	3100000	and now no women this time, it sounds like.
3100000	3104000	But I just like Pump Man. I'm sorry, it makes me think of the shoes.
3104000	3105000	It cracks me up.
3105000	3108000	I wonder if that's like a Dig Dug Pump Man or what the deal is there.
3108000	3110000	And Bobby Black Wolf says,
3110000	3113000	Commando Man, he fights you with no underwear?
3113000	3116000	I don't know if that's quite what they're going for with it,
3116000	3117000	but you never know.
3117000	3120000	And, like, literally four people all at once in chat are like,
3120000	3122000	Pump Man? Question mark.
3122000	3124000	At least he's not Pump It Up Man.
3124000	3126000	And Lord Moon asks, what's he pumping?
3126000	3128000	That's a good question.
3128000	3130000	I'm imagining it's like a Dig Dug boss.
3130000	3131000	I really don't know.
3131000	3135000	Like, uh, we are here to pump you up.
3135000	3136000	I don't know.
3136000	3139000	He fires steroid needles at you.
3139000	3143000	All right, anyhow, Dr. Sakura, what else is going on in gaming?
3143000	3147000	Well, the Greenpeace report came out.
3147000	3149000	You know how much stock I put in a lot of these.
3149000	3151000	Are those the people that tie themselves to boats and stuff?
3151000	3152000	Yes.
3152000	3153000	So fun.
3153000	3158000	But they have highlighted Nintendo as the most environmentally unfriendly
3158000	3161000	of electronic companies.
3161000	3164000	They put out Greenpeace's Guide to Green Electronics,
3164000	3172000	and it scored 1.4 out of 10 for its chemical and energy and waste policies,
3172000	3176000	and was the lowest of all the ones that were done out of 18.
3176000	3178000	They had a zero on e-waste,
3178000	3182000	because they didn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
3182000	3188000	even though they promised that there's greenhouse gas emissions from a Wii.
3188000	3190000	I never knew my Wii was slowly put away.
3190000	3194000	Maybe it's manufacturing the Wii is what they're talking about.
3194000	3201000	It did get some points for having PVC-free internal wiring.
3201000	3204000	It's been monitoring other harmful chemicals,
3204000	3209000	but it hasn't completely eliminated the use of PVC.
3209000	3216000	It also got some points for the DSiec adapter and for disclosing CO2 emissions.
3216000	3218000	But yeah, it still got bad.
3218000	3222000	Microsoft got 2.4 points, so it was actually just above Nintendo.
3222000	3228000	And of the major three, Sony was the most green,
3228000	3232000	and seventh place with a score of 5.1.
3232000	3238000	Honestly, really the tops of the ones were Nokia,
3238000	3244000	Sony, Ericsson, Toshiba, and Apple got a big special mention
3244000	3248000	for completely eliminating chemicals from the computer systems.
3248000	3253000	Honestly, I really don't care for Greenpeace as a facility all that much,
3253000	3259000	because of some inaccuracies in their own.
3259000	3263000	I'm not going to get on the sociopolitical platform right now.
3263000	3268000	People know there's a lot of stuff that I've said,
3268000	3270000	because they're just not accurate.
3270000	3272000	They try to put the spin on it for their own thing,
3272000	3274000	but I'm not going to go into that.
3274000	3279000	I do, however, think that it's just pretty interesting
3279000	3284000	seeing where I think the concern is going.
3284000	3288000	I'm all for being more green and environmentally friendly and all that,
3288000	3290000	solar power, wind power, et cetera, et cetera.
3290000	3294000	I do think one thing to study to show is that even though,
3294000	3296000	if I remember right, I saw the chart,
3296000	3298000	Microsoft is by no means a green-friendly company,
3298000	3300000	but they're higher up on the scale than Nintendo.
3300000	3303000	If they can make some cutbacks, I think, why can't Nintendo?
3303000	3306000	That's kind of like my thing is that they're both in the same business.
3306000	3308000	If Sony does really good, what changes?
3308000	3311000	I don't know the technical side of things so well,
3311000	3313000	but what are they doing in the manufacturing
3313000	3315000	that Nintendo and Microsoft can't do?
3315000	3319000	What can't they do?
3319000	3321000	I'm not going to go all hippie on you,
3321000	3327000	but I'm all for looking for ways to be cost-effective yet green.
3327000	3329000	Well, to be perfectly honest,
3329000	3331000	I think people have gone way too overboard with the whole green thing
3331000	3335000	because really I think a lot of it is probably going to get me some booze.
3335000	3338000	I really think a lot of it has to do with more ways to make money
3338000	3344000	and more marketing, more ways of...
3344000	3346000	I don't want to do the conspiracy thing
3346000	3350000	and say that it's them trying to control the way we think.
3350000	3351000	You know what I mean?
3351000	3355000	But I think that it is a degree of social conditioning.
3355000	3357000	What's interesting, and I don't want to go too far with this
3357000	3359000	because it's not about games,
3359000	3360000	but a lot of people buy their video games there.
3360000	3361000	I will say this.
3361000	3364000	I heard a story on the news this week that Walmart in our area,
3364000	3368000	Sacramento, at three test stores have eliminated plastic bags altogether.
3368000	3370000	And if you either bring your own bag
3370000	3375000	or they will sell you the blue reusable bags for 15 cents.
3375000	3378000	And this is in their efforts to cut back on the plastic waste.
3378000	3380000	And I think in theory it sounds like a good idea.
3380000	3381000	But I know me.
3381000	3383000	I don't usually plan my trips to Walmart that well.
3383000	3385000	It's more of a spur of the moment if I ever actually go to Walmart.
3385000	3387000	I don't usually shop at Walmart.
3387000	3388000	I usually go to Target.
3388000	3391000	But if it's happening at Walmart, it might happen at Target.
3391000	3393000	So I have to kind of think in those terms.
3393000	3395000	I would have a collection of those 15-cent bags
3395000	3397000	piled up to the ceiling in my house
3397000	3399000	because I would never remember to take them
3399000	3400000	and I would end up throwing them away and shit.
3400000	3401000	You know what I mean?
3401000	3402000	Look at your feet.
3402000	3403000	I know. You've got a couple of them there.
3403000	3405000	But those I always empty out.
3405000	3409000	And I actually keep three or four of them in my car at any given point in time.
3409000	3411000	So I actually do use them.
3411000	3416000	But honestly because I don't like throwing out the trash that often.
3416000	3417000	Really.
3417000	3419000	I think Dan do it.
3419000	3421000	I call bullshit on the whole Walmart thing.
3421000	3424000	And the reason why is because they're just looking for a way to make money.
3424000	3425000	Look at it.
3425000	3428000	They buy all these plastic bags
3428000	3430000	that they're going to have to give away for free at their store.
3430000	3431000	Look at it.
3431000	3433000	Now we can say that we're being green
3433000	3437000	and we can sell you bags to carry your crap home in.
3437000	3439000	IKEA makes you buy bags.
3439000	3441000	The grocery store, they do the reverse.
3441000	3443000	If you bring your own bag, they take off five cents.
3443000	3445000	Also, IKEA is like a pompous store too.
3445000	3448000	You know, fucking all high and mighty.
3448000	3454000	Smelling their own farts as South Park could put it.
3454000	3458000	Seriously, I mean, they have a bunch of shit there that's way too damn expensive.
3458000	3460000	Lord Moon in our chat says,
3460000	3461000	Just remember they're in your car.
3461000	3462000	Just remember they're in your car.
3462000	3463000	You know, in theory, that's a really good idea,
3463000	3465000	but yet I still see myself failing.
3465000	3466000	Here's what I'm going to do instead.
3466000	3467000	I'm not going to go shop at Walmart.
3467000	3469000	At least not that Walmart.
3469000	3471000	They're testing it.
3471000	3472000	They're testing it.
3472000	3473000	It's not in place yet.
3473000	3475000	They're testing it at three stores here.
3475000	3476000	Yeah, I know.
3476000	3478000	What I do with a lot of those bags too,
3478000	3481000	and this is something I've started doing about,
3481000	3483000	let's say, three semesters ago,
3483000	3485000	is when I take different classes,
3485000	3488000	I actually have my books and my supplies for different classes
3488000	3490000	in the different bags,
3490000	3492000	because I don't always take the same classes every day.
3492000	3494000	I mean, I'm going to have overlap this semester,
3494000	3497000	but when they're all in my car,
3497000	3499000	I just grab the bag I need and go,
3499000	3501000	and I don't have to worry about changing out my books or anything.
3501000	3503000	I actually reuse the plastic bags.
3503000	3504000	I'll take my lunches to work,
3504000	3506000	and I don't have a fancy thermos or nothing.
3506000	3507000	I don't need all that fancy shit.
3507000	3509000	I put it in a plastic bag and take it to work.
3509000	3513000	Or even if I'm taking bathroom supplies on a trip with me for travel,
3513000	3514000	I'll put it in a plastic bag.
3514000	3516000	It's stuff for the bathroom.
3516000	3518000	It doesn't need to be in a fancy plush case.
3518000	3521000	The other thing I use plastic bags for is when I dye my hair,
3521000	3523000	because I tend to splash everywhere.
3523000	3525000	A lot of people line the kitty liner with it.
3525000	3527000	Well, I get cat bag liners
3527000	3529000	because Jeremy has a big box for his stinky ass.
3529000	3534000	But I actually line my sink with plastic bags
3534000	3536000	so that I don't stain the sink,
3536000	3538000	since this technically isn't really our house.
3538000	3541000	I wanted to go back and read some of the comments on Mega Man 10
3541000	3543000	because there was some funny stuff in chat,
3543000	3547000	and I think Bochi Kawa hit the nail on the head earlier in our chatroom,
3547000	3548000	chat.orangehatcherday.com.
3548000	3551000	I think pump means like water pump,
3551000	3552000	and that's actually not a bad guess
3552000	3554000	because usually there's some type of water boss in the game,
3554000	3556000	and that's probably the one that's good.
3556000	3558000	I like Tiger Claw's comment too.
3558000	3560000	Pump could mean the first robot could be muscle bound.
3560000	3562000	At least they didn't call him Plump Man.
3562000	3563000	GS68 says,
3563000	3565000	If there ever is a final Mega Man game,
3565000	3568000	the last boss should simply be called The Man.
3568000	3570000	LOL, last Mega Man game.
3570000	3571000	You're funny.
3571000	3574000	Jay Dizzle commenting on this story says,
3574000	3576000	They have to disclose CO2 emissions,
3576000	3579000	so I can't fart without telling my supervisor.
3579000	3583000	Those comments from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
3583000	3585000	One other thing, and I do have to bring this up.
3585000	3590000	We actually do need a certain degree of CO2 in the air
3590000	3592000	for environmental balance,
3592000	3595000	and I think that people tend to take it a little bit too far.
3595000	3597000	I mean, I understand.
3597000	3599000	Yeah, we need to cut back on stuff.
3599000	3600000	There's certain things that are going on environmentally
3600000	3602000	that, yeah, we do have to be more mindful of,
3602000	3605000	but I really do think that people are taking it way too far.
3605000	3607000	They're reading more into things
3607000	3611000	and making, certainly, a catastrophe out of something that really isn't.
3611000	3613000	You know?
3613000	3614000	Alright.
3614000	3615000	We've got more gaming news
3615000	3617000	and then our Classic Game of the Week before too long here.
3617000	3618000	Logie?
3618000	3619000	Yeah.
3619000	3624000	Well, if you have some EA games that are a tad bit old and dusty,
3624000	3627000	you may not be able to play those online soon enough
3627000	3631000	because they are going to be shutting down some of their older game servers.
3631000	3633000	And some of the games that they have,
3633000	3638000	actually, some of the games on the list aren't too old.
3638000	3643000	For example, Facebreaker, which came out about a year ago,
3643000	3645000	is being shut down.
3645000	3648000	Some other ones on the list,
3648000	3650000	Madden 08 and Madden 09.
3650000	3652000	08 is being shut down.
3652000	3659000	These are on February 2nd on the Wii and PC, and 09 on Xbox, the original Xbox,
3659000	3662000	Wii and on PSP.
3662000	3666000	Also, some other older sports games,
3666000	3673000	March Madness 07, NBA Live 07, 08, 09,
3673000	3677000	at least on the Wii, and that's in Europe only,
3677000	3680000	NCAA Football, NASCAR.
3680000	3685000	NASCAR 09 I've come surprised on because they actually don't have a new NASCAR game,
3685000	3688000	so that's interesting.
3688000	3693000	That is only on PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360, though, in Europe only.
3693000	3698000	Let's see, and then of course they're going to be doing some more April 1st,
3698000	3705000	and that's going to be the rest of Madden NFL 07, Madden NFL 08,
3705000	3707000	which, I mean, come on.
3707000	3713000	Madden NFL 07, that's from 06, so that's a good four years old,
3713000	3717000	almost four years old by the time that they shut it down.
3717000	3720000	I mean, on the original Xbox.
3720000	3724000	I don't know. I'm not too surprised, but maybe some people are.
3724000	3727000	But hell, buy Madden 09 or something.
3727000	3731000	I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.
3731000	3735000	And a few Tyler Woods games also.
3735000	3737000	It's always kind of sad when they shut servers down,
3737000	3740000	but at the same time, you know, I get it with the sports games.
3740000	3743000	Most of those folks upgrade. They're just not cost effective to run.
3743000	3744000	You know what I mean?
3744000	3748000	Yes. Another game also, not exactly an EA game,
3748000	3750000	that's also having their server shut down.
3750000	3757000	In fact, actually shutting down, I don't know if it's already happened already,
3757000	3761000	but ChromeHounds, apparently, the server shut down.
3761000	3766000	Yeah, I can see why. That game really got boring really fast.
3766000	3771000	And apparently, this happened way back.
3771000	3775000	Oh, apparently this week is when it actually shut down.
3775000	3779000	Apparently, they announced the shutdown back in August,
3779000	3782000	but they finally shut the servers off this week.
3782000	3785000	So, that's too bad.
3785000	3788000	But, eh, we have a farm in core now.
3788000	3793000	And we're going to be having, soon enough, the new front mission game,
3793000	3797000	which is going to be all sorts of awesome.
3797000	3799000	Bobby in chat, because you might remember Bobby was talking about
3799000	3801000	ChromeHounds a lot when that game first came out.
3801000	3803000	He said, ChromeHounds shut down last week.
3803000	3808000	All my friends did one last hurrah last weekend. I wasn't home.
3808000	3811000	Well, it's always sad when the games that you like, their servers shut down.
3811000	3813000	Like, I remember when the Amplitude servers shut down.
3813000	3816000	I had a cry, but, you know, some of the games were just old.
3816000	3818000	I wonder if ChromeHounds was System Link as well,
3818000	3820000	because that might not be so bad.
3820000	3823000	At least you could do, like, LAN or something like that.
3823000	3827000	They don't really have a lot of System Link games anymore, anyways.
3827000	3830000	But, I wonder if that was one of them that was.
3830000	3833000	Well, that's probably kind of a pain in the ass to do, too,
3833000	3835000	the whole System Link thing, you know?
3835000	3838000	Well, there's people that like doing LAN stuff, and I mean, yeah,
3838000	3842000	it may be a pain in the ass, but, I don't know.
3842000	3845000	That'd be kind of neat, though, if it was System Link.
3845000	3851000	And... it's not. Bummer.
3851000	3853000	All right, some more news for you guys,
3853000	3857000	and this has to do with another thing getting shut down,
3857000	3861000	but not quite an actually authorized video game.
3861000	3864000	No, Nintendo has put the smackdown on a fan film
3864000	3867000	that was being made for quite some time, actually.
3867000	3869000	I guess this film had been taken, like, four years to make,
3869000	3872000	but considering there's a bunch of people that did it in their free time,
3872000	3875000	the Zelda movie was called The Hero of Time,
3875000	3877000	and they actually put it out on the internet.
3877000	3881000	I got some mixed reviews, but, you know, I mean, it was a fan thing.
3881000	3886000	I wouldn't expect anything that's, like, you know, Hollywood caliber stuff.
3886000	3889000	You know, folks were at least kind of appreciative that the movie,
3889000	3892000	I guess, had been made, but not Nintendo,
3892000	3896000	because the movie's official site on New Year's Day, actually,
3896000	3898000	so this is a little bit over a week old,
3898000	3901000	but the community site actually had to take the movie down
3901000	3904000	because the studio came to an agreement with Nintendo.
3904000	3906000	They actually say, quote,
3906000	3909000	We understand Nintendo's right to protect its characters and trademarks,
3909000	3912000	and understand how in order to keep their property unspoiled
3912000	3914000	by fan interpretations of the franchise,
3914000	3918000	Nintendo needs to protect itself, even from fan works with good intentions.
3918000	3921000	I'm sure our next project will be right around the corner.
3921000	3923000	No, it's not Majora's Mask.
3923000	3926000	So, yeah, they won't be making a movie out of that.
3926000	3929000	You know, although you might go,
3929000	3933000	Nintendo's the big bad guy coming around kind of shutting off all these fan projects,
3933000	3936000	I get why they had to do it,
3936000	3941000	because unfortunately not everyone might think that this is an unauthorized movie,
3941000	3944000	because think about how, like, you know, that whole game of telephone works,
3944000	3946000	especially so on the internet.
3946000	3948000	One thing gets passed along to another person.
3948000	3951000	Somebody's going to say, hey, dude, have you seen the Zelda movie?
3951000	3952000	Let me hand this to you.
3952000	3955000	This is the fucking Legend of Zelda movie, and then it's not good.
3955000	3963000	And if they don't protect their actual trademarks, then they will no longer have, you know, those trademarks, basically,
3963000	3969000	because if, you know, they become unprotected, then, you know, anybody can rip that stuff off.
3969000	3974000	The other thing, though, to kind of go with that, though, is it's already on YouTube, of course, in parts.
3974000	3977000	The thing is, once they hit the internet, though, that's the other side of it,
3977000	3979000	is that once something hits the internet, it's done.
3979000	3983000	I mean, there's no, like, it's not like you can say,
3983000	3986000	oh, well, now nobody will ever see this.
3986000	3990000	Nope, once it hits the internet, it's done.
3990000	3992000	Everybody has it if they want to know where to go look.
3992000	3993000	And, yeah, it's on YouTube.
3993000	3995000	Tigerclaw just linked us to it in our chat room.
3995000	3998000	And you can actually see we're playing, like, just a little clip here.
3998000	3999000	And I watched the first few clips.
3999000	4000000	In the studio.
4000000	4001000	And it's kind of boring.
4001000	4002000	Is it?
4002000	4004000	Let's just look at it a little bit here.
4009000	4011000	I don't know, some chick's crying in the forest.
4011000	4012000	I don't know if that's Zelda.
4012000	4014000	Maybe that's supposed to be, like, Link when he's born or something.
4017000	4022000	I mean, it looks like something that would have been on TV in the 1980s.
4022000	4025000	I was going to say, it has, like, the same kind of production quality
4025000	4027000	as, like, the Highlander.
4027000	4029000	It looks like Beauty and the Beast to me.
4029000	4030000	Yeah.
4032000	4035000	Do you remember that old-ass show, Beauty and the Beast,
4035000	4037000	with what's-her-name that went on to be in the Terminator?
4037000	4038000	Linda Hamilton.
4038000	4039000	That's it, Linda Hamilton.
4039000	4042000	Dude, I love that show, by the way.
4042000	4043000	Anyhow, sorry.
4043000	4045000	I guess that was a little prologue there.
4045000	4048000	Yeah, it's all over YouTube, so take a look if you want.
4048000	4051000	Anyway, release date's coming up after another story from Dark Sakura.
4053000	4054000	Dropping stuff everywhere.
4054000	4055000	She doesn't drop all her stuff everywhere.
4055000	4056000	You all right?
4056000	4057000	Can you continue?
4057000	4059000	Is this a workman's comp issue?
4059000	4060000	All right.
4060000	4063000	There are four letters I'd like to say to you.
4063000	4064000	Hello?
4064000	4065000	Oh, wait, no, too many.
4065000	4068000	S-T-F-U.
4068000	4071000	And that's with all the love in my heart.
4071000	4077000	Well, EA actually has hired somebody, so not everyone's losing their job.
4077000	4079000	They hired Mark Tramiel.
4079000	4081000	You know what Mark Tramiel gave us?
4081000	4083000	NBA Jam.
4083000	4086000	Boom Shakalaka.
4086000	4093000	So basically, since they're trying to revive NBA Jam for Wii,
4093000	4096000	why not hire the guy who made it?
4096000	4100000	I think that's a good idea.
4100000	4103000	So maybe we'll see what happens.
4103000	4105000	I'm all for an NBA Jam revival.
4105000	4108000	That was a fun game back in the arcades.
4108000	4112000	I always thought it was the kind of thing that would come to Xbox Live Arcade or PSN,
4112000	4114000	but okay, the Wii.
4114000	4117000	I guess I can accept that, depending on what they do with it,
4117000	4122000	as long as they don't make it over the top with the motion control and all that stuff.
4122000	4123000	I don't know.
4123000	4124000	I guess we'll see.
4124000	4127000	You can still play as Bill Clinton.
4127000	4130000	Or, you know, Liu Kang.
4130000	4134000	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some upcoming video games.
4134000	4139000	NBA Jam I don't think is one of them yet, but I bet you that's an E3 title.
4139000	4142000	That's something we'll see at E3. We'll see.
4142000	4144000	Yep.
4144000	4147000	Well, this week we actually have some decent stuff coming out,
4147000	4150000	starting off with Army of Two, the 40th day,
4150000	4155000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PSP.
4155000	4158000	The PSP one, though, is supposed to be more like Contra, so that's kind of cool.
4158000	4163000	Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.
4163000	4165000	That's a long-ass title.
4165000	4170000	Coming out on Xbox 360 and also on PS3 as well.
4170000	4175000	Skycrawler's Innocent Aces on the Wii, coming from Exceed.
4175000	4179000	We've got a Sims 2 kind of re-release collection.
4179000	4185000	The Sims 2 Fun with Pets collection, which includes three of the expansions.
4185000	4188000	You said Sims 2 Fun with Pets?
4188000	4190000	Sims 2 Fun with Pets.
4190000	4192000	Even though Sims 3 is out now.
4192000	4194000	It's just a compilation.
4194000	4197000	Can you torture the pets in the same way that you torture humans?
4197000	4202000	Well, it's got Sims 2 Pets and Sims 2 Family Fun and Sims 2...
4202000	4204000	Not that I would ever do that.
4204000	4207000	I want Pets and Sims 3. I'm waiting for it.
4207000	4209000	I want to present all sides of the issue.
4209000	4218000	Yeah, it's the Sims 2 Pets, Sims 2 H&M Family Fun stuff, and Sims 2 Mansion and Garden stuff.
4218000	4219000	So you can get that.
4219000	4222000	There's actually another Sims 3 expansion coming in March.
4222000	4225000	I don't remember what it's called, though, unfortunately.
4225000	4231000	Daniel X coming out on the DS.
4231000	4236000	Which I think that's based off a movie or TV show, I can't remember.
4236000	4239000	Twin Sector on the PC.
4239000	4243000	Sands of Destruction coming out from Sega.
4243000	4244000	That's on the DS.
4244000	4247000	Pretty cool role-playing game.
4247000	4252000	God, why do you let me down Konami?
4252000	4257000	Their brand new music rhythm game, which is crap, called Walk It Out.
4257000	4261000	Yes, it's a game for the Wii about walking.
4261000	4266000	Awesome, because this is way better than any other good music game that could possibly release.
4266000	4271000	Let's release another one that's about walking.
4271000	4277000	And finally, a week from today, Glory of Hercules coming out on the Nintendo DS from Nintendo.
4277000	4282000	The first time that that series has been over here.
4282000	4288000	Pretty soon, Konami's going to put out a music game called Let's Push the Power Button.
4288000	4291000	Bobbing your head to the music.
4291000	4294000	What is love? Baby, don't hurt me.
4294000	4296000	Hey, going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.
4296000	4300000	Batman, Arkham Asylum, yes, it's taken a little while to come to Japan.
4300000	4302000	But of course, they're probably having to redub everything in Japanese.
4302000	4307000	So that is getting its release this week on the Xbox 360 and I believe the PlayStation 3 as well.
4307000	4313000	Operation Flashpoint, Dragon Rising, also making its way to the Xbox 360 and the PS3.
4313000	4316000	The PS3 is getting a price reduction on BioShock.
4316000	4319000	It's coming in a little while, but that would be the Japanese localized version there.
4319000	4321000	That's coming out there.
4321000	4324000	On the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard, the Dark Side Chronicles.
4324000	4327000	And that, of course, would be Resident Evil over here in the US.
4327000	4332000	So that would be Resident Evil, Dark Side Chronicles making its way out on the Wii this week in Japan.
4332000	4334000	Nothing of note really on the PlayStation 2.
4334000	4337000	On the DS, there's a game called Last Window.
4337000	4340000	Myonaka no Yakusoku comes out this week on the DS.
4340000	4343000	I'm trying to see what kind of game that is.
4343000	4346000	It's by Nintendo. It's some type of first party game.
4346000	4349000	It looks to be kind of like one of those investigative games.
4349000	4353000	It's a sequel to Hotel Dusk, I think.
4353000	4356000	Oh! It does look like that.
4356000	4357000	That's what it is.
4357000	4358000	Last Window, that would make sense.
4358000	4360000	Okay, so it's like a sequel to that in Japan.
4360000	4364000	I know part of the name is Promise, so I don't understand the rest of it.
4364000	4366000	That could have to do with the story, so that makes sense.
4366000	4368000	Alright, very cool.
4368000	4372000	Also coming out, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.
4372000	4374000	I don't know if they're having the same busy first quarter we are.
4374000	4377000	But on the Sony PSP, it's got a few things.
4377000	4380000	Tekken 6 is getting a release on the PSP in Japan this week.
4380000	4383000	Spectral vs. Generation gets a price reduction this week.
4383000	4390000	And Kentushi Gladiator Begins is a game that's coming out from the company Acquire.
4390000	4394000	And it looks to be, you know, it's got kind of the gladiator on the front.
4394000	4400000	It does look like it's kind of a gladiator Roman times and all that inspired game,
4400000	4404000	like a fighting game. Kind of a little bit God of War-ish,
4404000	4408000	but a little bit closer in the camera and a little bit closer combat,
4408000	4410000	it looks like, from the screenshots we're looking at.
4410000	4412000	I don't know if that's something they're planning on bringing over here.
4412000	4417000	Oh, by the way, if you do like Bleach, Soul Carnival gets a price reduction on the PSP this week as well.
4417000	4419000	That does it for Japanese releases. How about the UK?
4419000	4421000	For the UK, I've just got a few.
4421000	4427000	We have Army of Two, the 40th day on Xbox 360 and PS3 and PSP.
4427000	4430000	We have Astro Boy for Wii DS and PSP.
4430000	4433000	Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.
4433000	4437000	On PS3, PC, and Xbox 360. Sit.
4437000	4441000	Looking at some of the comments in our chat room, chat.orangeonsrader.com,
4441000	4443000	some people getting in on the walk it out fun.
4443000	4447000	Bochikawa says, I want to see clap fun on the Wii.
4447000	4453000	Game Guru says, Konami's press start to win, where you press start and you win.
4453000	4455000	No, it should be the standby to win the game.
4455000	4461000	Wow. Amalthea, I hope I'm saying that right, saying they should have the walking the dog game soon.
4461000	4464000	That would be cool, like all these old 80's dances and stuff.
4464000	4466000	Everybody walk the dinosaur.
4466000	4472000	Here's the thing though, actually, speaking of all that dancing, a co-worker of mine,
4472000	4477000	I don't know a lot of hardcore gamers at work, although this guy in particular does play a lot of video games.
4477000	4480000	He told me that just dance on the Wii is actually a lot of fun.
4480000	4483000	And some of the OLR people have said that too.
4483000	4486000	It's a horrible game, but I've been selling a ton of it.
4486000	4491000	Apparently it's kind of like a Dark Horse type of game that's selling very well.
4491000	4493000	It's not a Konami game though, right?
4493000	4496000	Apparently just dance is kind of a Dark Horse game right now.
4496000	4503000	They also have this other one coming out called Dance Sensation that's going to be very similar to that in March.
4503000	4507000	But it does have the bird, the zirphine bird.
4507000	4510000	Bird, bird, bird. The bird is a word.
4510000	4514000	I still want X-Tango.
4514000	4519000	And of course Tiger Claw takes things straight to the toilet saying, how about jack it out?
4519000	4521000	Of course he means a jack in the box, right?
4521000	4523000	Turn the crank.
4523000	4525000	Wink, wink, no judge.
4525000	4527000	He means turning the crank, but not the kind of...
4527000	4530000	Anyhow, how about more gaming news?
4530000	4534000	Actually I have a better name for that particular version of it.
4534000	4536000	Please.
4536000	4539000	Ceiling Cat is watching you play this game.
4539000	4541000	They should really just call it Walk It Off.
4541000	4543000	You'll be fap to win.
4543000	4545000	They should just call it Walk It Off.
4545000	4548000	Someone gets brutally injured and they have to walk it off.
4548000	4553000	Amathia also chimes in and says, why don't they transfer the Taiko drum games to the Wii? It would be perfect.
4553000	4557000	I believe they did. They have a little inflatable drum even, but it's in Japan.
4557000	4558000	They didn't bring it over here.
4558000	4561000	So you might have to write Namco and bug them.
4561000	4564000	Or you're probably going to have to mod your Wii and import the Japanese version.
4564000	4567000	But yeah, there's a cute little inflatable drum and everything.
4567000	4570000	But those games, if I remember right, are pretty heavily Japanese.
4570000	4574000	Like, you know, they're not translated in English, so yeah.
4574000	4577000	Good luck navigating it.
4577000	4580000	Alright, couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4580000	4585000	And it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what Dark Soccer has picked this week, but it's a good one nonetheless.
4585000	4595000	Alright, well there's some news coming about what maybe announced at E3 perhaps this year.
4595000	4603000	Satoru Iwata has offered some information regarding the next DS system.
4603000	4609000	And this is the next, not necessarily next revision of the system.
4609000	4622000	They're saying that the true next Nintendo handheld system, this is from an interview with a Asahi Shimbun newspaper, I'm assuming in Japan.
4622000	4633000	It says it will have highly detailed graphics and it will be a necessity to have a sensor with the ability to read movements of people playing.
4633000	4639000	In other words, it's going to have a tilt sensor, sort of like the iPhone.
4639000	4647000	And I guess they also, you know, have done some experiments with motion control gaming and stuff on the DS.
4647000	4650000	Well, neat.
4650000	4658000	Also, another rumor that's still going around is some sort of 3G-like service for the DS.
4658000	4669000	And something that they're going to have DS Wi-Fi hotspots or something like that, that you're going to be able to connect with people or download content or something like that.
4669000	4680000	Also, they said there's going to be a new Zelda game sort of revealed, I guess, revealed this year at E3. I guess it was sort of revealed last year.
4680000	4684000	But, you know, it's actually going to be released by the end of 2010.
4684000	4687000	Well, remember they had like the screenshots and stuff.
4687000	4689000	Well, they had some artwork, I think.
4689000	4696000	And then the Wii Vitality sensor, of course, is going to also have some software and stuff unveiled at E3.
4696000	4705000	However, though, if you think about it, they don't really need the tilt sensors and stuff in the DS or the new DS2 or whatever you're going to call it.
4705000	4712000	There's actually been some demos put out by Engine Software. It's a studio that develops different games.
4712000	4721000	They have a demo of a game called Tilt that kind of looks a little bit like Marvel Blast Ultra or like Monkey Ball or something like that.
4721000	4727000	And it does tilt sensors, or I guess motion control, based on the camera.
4727000	4732000	Because, you remember, the DSi has a camera built into it and can detect movement.
4732000	4735000	So, you can basically do that.
4735000	4744000	You know, it acts like tilting the actual system without needing actual motion sensors inside the system.
4744000	4746000	You can do it with the camera.
4746000	4752000	So, I don't think it's a necessity that they need to add motion sensors to the system.
4752000	4755000	I mean, they can never do this stuff with the DS.
4755000	4764000	And they actually apparently have the, I don't know, would call it drivers, I guess, the libraries for this technology.
4764000	4772000	This company has it available for, I guess, they're working on a DSiWare game that's going to incorporate this new technology.
4772000	4778000	So, that'd be cool to see. But, I don't know, do we really need motion sensors with a portable system?
4778000	4780000	I don't know if that's the case.
4780000	4783000	I can understand it with the iPhone because there's no actual buttons on it.
4783000	4787000	I mean, so how else are you going to control stuff?
4787000	4791000	But, I don't know, maybe we'll see the buttons go away.
4791000	4794000	That'd be kind of crappy, though.
4794000	4800000	Alright, it's very interesting, though, that there's a new DS kind of definitely in the works, it sounds like, for E3.
4800000	4803000	That could be their big announcement this year is that, hey, new DS.
4803000	4807000	Wouldn't that piss everybody off because now they have this DS XL or whatever?
4807000	4808000	But not in America.
4808000	4809000	Not in America.
4809000	4810000	Maybe they don't plan on bringing it here because of that.
4810000	4812000	But they just brought out the DSi, what, a year ago?
4812000	4814000	I know, I know.
4814000	4819000	Hey, you know what, though? Apple puts out a new phone every year.
4819000	4821000	I mean, is that different? I don't know.
4821000	4826000	Yeah, but that's just the specs slightly upgraded. This is going to be a whole new system.
4826000	4831000	I don't know, it's... stop. Just make some good games for it.
4831000	4835000	Have you really utilized this new technology and all these different upgrades yet?
4835000	4840000	I mean, have they really done anything with the cameras other than, hey, look, now you can put your face in this.
4840000	4842000	Oh, wow, awesome.
4842000	4845000	You know, actually, Nintendo hasn't really done anything with the camera other than, you know...
4845000	4852000	The DSi needs an app like the unicorn thing on the iPhone, where you can take pictures of people and turn them into unicorns.
4852000	4855000	It's seriously one of the best iPhone apps ever.
4855000	4860000	It's U-Y-O-U in a corn. Look it up, it's awesome.
4860000	4865000	I don't know about that, but seriously, what's the point in adding... they had all these, like...
4865000	4869000	Oh, yeah, there's two cameras in it now, and you can do all this stuff with the music.
4869000	4876000	You can manipulate music and whatnot, and they've got all these iPhone... or not iPhone, like, different little applications and stuff.
4876000	4879000	And then they move on to something else, but they haven't even really done anything with it.
4879000	4882000	It's like the IR port in the PSP is completely useless.
4882000	4886000	I'd just be perfectly happy if they had, you know, a built-in Mario Paint mode.
4886000	4889000	All right, we've got to keep the show moving. I do want to say real quick, though...
4889000	4894000	Giovedea in chat had a really good suggestion for the game's name that was inspired by Tiger Claw.
4894000	4896000	You know, the whole turning the crank game?
4896000	4900000	She says they ought to just call it Beat It, and you could already have some soundtrack in it.
4906000	4908000	Oh, yeah, this game's hot.
4908000	4911000	I just scarred all of our listeners.
4911000	4916000	All right, hey, one other music game that might be for real, for serious. No, really.
4916000	4918000	Def Leppard, the game.
4918000	4924000	Apparently, it's coming from a Rooters report, Rooters being one of the big news agencies with Associated Press, of course.
4924000	4932000	Apparently, the publishing company Primary Wave made a deal with Def Leppard to make a cartoon series and a video game that will be based on the band.
4932000	4937000	The video game project is being called Unusual. Don't know what that means.
4937000	4945000	But that's just all a rumor right now, so it's not some type of Def Leppard rock band or anything like that.
4945000	4947000	Perhaps Revolution Def?
4947000	4949000	Eh? Eh?
4949000	4953000	Sequel, maybe? Yes? It's unusual. That would be unusual.
4953000	4959000	I have to say this, and I'm going to take a lot of shit for this, just like when I said it about other bands.
4959000	4962000	Def Leppard is not a big enough band to get their own game.
4962000	4965000	I don't think Green Day is, either, though, and apparently they're getting their own game.
4965000	4975000	But only really certain bands that have really stood the test of time and spanned multiple decades with consistent number one hits deserve their own game.
4975000	4977000	Journey is just a personal favorite.
4977000	4981000	Well, they had 80s and 90s, and they still have that Filipino guy now with them.
4981000	4985000	Like, Elvis might be big enough.
4985000	4988000	Or U2, I think, was a really good idea. I think U2 could get their own game.
4988000	4993000	If it was an Elvis game, though, you'd have to have sensors on your hips.
4993000	4996000	I kind of want to see the focus away from these band-specific music games.
4996000	4998000	It's getting to be a little much.
4998000	5001000	Van Halen, let's face it, was not that great.
5001000	5003000	It's an excuse to release another game.
5003000	5006000	That's really what it is, because you can sell extra copies.
5006000	5012000	Let's keep in mind, back it up a minute, because keep in mind, this Def Leppard thing has nothing to do with Harmonix or Activision.
5012000	5016000	It's another company, so if there is a music game coming out, it's different.
5016000	5018000	That could be anything.
5018000	5021000	I don't know, though. I think it's all talk.
5021000	5023000	I don't think it'll happen.
5023000	5026000	I think if they do the test marketing and sampling, they're going to find there's not enough interest for it.
5026000	5028000	And why would Def Leppard say, you know,
5028000	5035000	oh, let's go with another company for a music game instead of jumping on an established franchise,
5035000	5041000	where they would get the marketing support and the popularity from the rock band or guitar hero franchises.
5041000	5043000	I just don't get why they would just go,
5043000	5047000	eh, whatever, we don't need all that stuff, we're Def Leppard.
5047000	5050000	I did like their last album.
5050000	5053000	Yeah, but I don't think it's like sold platinum copies, you know?
5053000	5056000	They're kind of more of a nostalgia band at this point.
5056000	5058000	Do you see what this is, though?
5058000	5060000	Bon Jovi's new album. It was a gift.
5060000	5061000	I don't like Bon Jovi.
5061000	5062000	Dude, I love Bon Jovi.
5062000	5066000	Anyhow, this is the part of the show, speaking of blasts from the past,
5066000	5069000	where we like to open up the vault and take a trip down memory lane
5069000	5073000	and, you know, respect the classics with a little segment we do here on OLR
5073000	5075000	called the Classic Game of the Week.
5075000	5077000	Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she says,
5077000	5081000	you know what, you kids today that don't listen to your Def Leppard
5081000	5084000	and Bon Jovi like you should, you need to go back
5084000	5086000	and look at this classic game from the past.
5086000	5088000	Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week this week?
5088000	5090000	The classic game is NBA Jam.
5090000	5091000	Of course.
5091000	5095000	And because there is no actual music really played much in the game
5095000	5100000	while you're playing, I just found arcade samples, so...
5104000	5106000	Boom, Shakalaka!
5106000	5107000	Yeah.
5107000	5109000	He's on fire!
5109000	5114000	Anyway, NBA Jam came out in 1993 for the arcade,
5114000	5119000	and it spawned a series, and actually it was written in assembly,
5119000	5121000	and of course, as I said in an earlier story,
5121000	5127000	it was designed and programmed by Mark Turmel.
5127000	5134000	It used a lot of the big names from the 92, 93 NBA system,
5134000	5139000	and then, of course, for the console releases, it used the 93, 94,
5139000	5147000	and there have been later versions that came out on Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear.
5147000	5151000	So, but of course there were certain licensing things,
5151000	5154000	like they couldn't get Michael Jordan for the Bulls at the time,
5154000	5157000	so they did get Scottie Pippen at the time.
5157000	5161000	They also got certain ones were missing from the home versions,
5161000	5166000	like Gary Payton and Shaquille O'Neal.
5166000	5171000	There's also, of course, as we mentioned, a possibility of it being out on Wii.
5171000	5175000	So, some of the pretty cool stuff, though, is this game,
5175000	5178000	and this was what I think is really the notable part of it,
5178000	5184000	is that the games had their digitized likenesses of the players included in the game,
5184000	5188000	so that you could see their faces while they played.
5188000	5192000	And then if you got three baskets in a row, you were on fire,
5192000	5198000	and so you could be unlimited turbo, no goaltending,
5198000	5206000	you could shoot better until the other team scored.
5206000	5213000	Also, you didn't have fouls, free throws, that type of thing.
5213000	5216000	And you've got your spectacular dunk shots,
5216000	5220000	so it was really more of a fantasy basketball type game.
5220000	5226000	As far as Easter eggs that were in the game, you could...
5226000	5228000	Like, the Genesis actually had one, and I remember this one,
5228000	5236000	super clean floors, where if you run too fast, you could slide and fall.
5236000	5240000	And then there were the hidden characters, like you could play as Bill Clinton.
5240000	5244000	You could play the Charlotte Hornets mascot.
5244000	5250000	And then there were early versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition
5250000	5253000	that you let you play as Mortal Kombat characters.
5253000	5261000	And I actually remembered playing beta versions of the game.
5261000	5264000	By the way, you should play the Tournament Edition one that I linked up.
5264000	5268000	Oh, I just keep hopping from music to music.
5268000	5270000	That one's fine.
5270000	5274000	I like the Tournament Edition halftime music that I linked up in.
5274000	5275000	I'll get it.
5275000	5281000	Okay, but anyway, they actually were taken out because of the violence
5281000	5283000	that the Mortal Kombat characters represented.
5283000	5288000	However, like I said, I played beta versions of it that everyone was in.
5288000	5291000	There were a lot of...
5291000	5298000	For NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat 2, there were a lot of beta versions
5298000	5300000	of the games on the East Coast.
5300000	5302000	So I got to check those out at the time.
5302000	5305000	It was that year I went to New York.
5305000	5306000	So I got to see them a lot on the way up the East Coast.
5306000	5308000	It was pretty cool.
5308000	5314000	So yeah, just to go over some of the people in the arcade version,
5314000	5320000	you had Shaquille O'Neal, you had Isaiah Thomas, you had Reggie Miller,
5320000	5322000	Harvey Grant.
5322000	5326000	For the SNES Genesis one, like some of the other people in there
5326000	5333000	like Alonzo Warnings, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Sega CD.
5333000	5335000	Bless you, by the way.
5335000	5342000	You had a lot of the same people, just newer updates to them.
5342000	5344000	And then, of course, you had the Game Gear ones.
5344000	5347000	Really a lot of the same people, though there were a few that,
5347000	5351000	for licensing issues, were out.
5351000	5360000	You also had Charles Barkley, you had all the big people.
5360000	5362000	I don't know if anyone kept up with basketball back then.
5362000	5364000	I actually did.
5364000	5366000	So it was pretty cool.
5366000	5369000	There were sequels.
5369000	5372000	There was an NBA Jam Tournament Edition.
5372000	5377000	There were all kinds of different ports.
5377000	5381000	There was actually an Atari Jaguar version of it.
5381000	5385000	There was NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, which was a 3D version
5385000	5391000	that had Marv Albert doing the commentary.
5391000	5396000	There was...
5396000	5401000	It actually was revised as NBA Hang Time.
5401000	5403000	Do you remember that one?
5403000	5404000	I do.
5404000	5405000	Wasn't the same.
5405000	5409000	There was a college version that's called College Slam.
5409000	5416000	And then there were, of course, all the other sports games that Midway did.
5416000	5420000	They did a two-on-two open ice challenge.
5420000	5425000	But then it came out as Wayne Gretzky 3D hockey and NFL Blitz.
5425000	5428000	Blitz, I think, was another one in the thing.
5428000	5430000	And then I think more of a spiritual successor, though, to NBA Jam
5430000	5437000	was the NBA Showtime series that came out, the NBA on NBC.
5437000	5440000	Hoops was supposed to be on there.
5440000	5446000	But anyway, that's really it.
5446000	5447000	All right.
5447000	5450000	By the way, I got linked to something awesome from XLink in our chat room.
5450000	5452000	He linked me to this thing that's great.
5452000	5453000	For instance, watch this.
5453000	5455000	Hey, Jamie, what did you have for breakfast today?
5455000	5457000	I didn't.
5457000	5459000	Boom shakalaka!
5459000	5460000	That's cool.
5460000	5463000	Is there the, uh, it's in the shoes?
5463000	5466000	Or is it the shoes?
5466000	5468000	Oh my! He's on fire!
5468000	5470000	No.
5470000	5471000	Propel town!
5471000	5475000	Actually, one of my favorite ones was, um, Couldn't Buy a Bucket.
5475000	5477000	Heating out!
5477000	5479000	Ugly shot!
5479000	5482000	Yeah.
5482000	5483000	Fantastic!
5483000	5485000	All right, I'll cut it out, but I just-
5485000	5489000	It's funny, though, that you'd get a kick out of Marv Albert being in one of these.
5489000	5491000	Eh, it's kind of funny, but I just-
5491000	5496000	You know, I'm not a big, big fan of, um, sports games, usually.
5496000	5498000	You know, I just- I don't watch a lot, you know, whatever.
5498000	5500000	But I loved NBA Jam.
5500000	5501000	I played the crap out of that game.
5501000	5502000	Oh, yeah.
5502000	5504000	And if I do watch any sports, it's probably basketball.
5504000	5506000	It's the one I like more than anything.
5506000	5511000	All right, well, anyhow, we got plenty more of gaming news coming up later in the show here.
5511000	5513000	We're gonna take a quick break, though, for our live folks.
5513000	5515000	And for you podcast folks, just sit on tight.
5515000	5517000	We'll be right back after a little interlude.
5517000	5520000	But when we come back after the break, we got a lot, a lot of rapid-fire news tonight.
5520000	5521000	Some quick stuff.
5521000	5522000	Your Twitter topics.
5522000	5525000	Uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about some Blizzard rumors.
5525000	5528000	A game that apparently is no longer being published or shipped.
5528000	5531000	Um, a Wii Wand with MotionPlus built in.
5531000	5534000	And plenty more when we come back from a quick break.
5534000	5535000	Excuse me.
5535000	5537000	We're live. I have the hiccups. I can't handle it.
5537000	5539000	All right, so I'm glad we're taking a break right now.
5539000	5543000	And we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5549000	5555000	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday night, January the 10th of 2010.
5555000	5558000	Uh, we are here, of course, every Sunday night at All Games Radio.
5558000	5562000	www.allgames.com, taping Orange Lounge Radio.
5562000	5564000	Tonight is episode number 352.
5564000	5567000	If you are just joining us, just a quick live programming note.
5567000	5572000	We will not be live for the next two weeks due to various personal conflicts.
5572000	5575000	However, we will be pre-taping a show at least in two weeks.
5575000	5578000	But we are taking the Martin Luther King holiday off completely.
5578000	5580000	I just want to make sure you guys know.
5580000	5583000	But stay tuned to our podcast feed and all that fun stuff.
5583000	5585000	Anyhow, we got plenty more news to cover tonight, though.
5585000	5587000	And then, of course, phone calls and so forth.
5587000	5589000	So let's get into some rapid-fire news tonight.
5589000	5590000	Loki.
5590000	5597000	Yes, Dragon Age Origins is getting a brand new expansion in March.
5597000	5600000	The new expansion is called Awakening.
5600000	5602000	And it'll be coming out March 16th.
5602000	5609000	It's going to be the first retail expansion for Dragon Age Origins.
5609000	5613000	Apparently going to be available for $40.
5613000	5615000	And I'm not sure if that's actually coming out.
5615000	5617000	I think that's also on $360 as well.
5617000	5620000	I mean, that's kind of expensive. $40?
5620000	5623000	Well, if it's a lot of content, it could be nice.
5623000	5627000	That better be a damn... I mean, a lot of content.
5627000	5630000	I mean, look at all the expansions that they had for, you know...
5630000	5631000	Oblivion.
5631000	5633000	For, you know, Fallout 3.
5633000	5637000	I mean, those were, you know, about $10 each or $20 each.
5637000	5641000	I don't know. We'll see.
5641000	5642000	It'll be interesting.
5642000	5646000	Anyways, so March 16th, if you're looking forward to that.
5646000	5649000	Left 4 Dead is kind of getting a demake.
5649000	5659000	They have an 8-bit version of Left 4 Dead that's been made by a guy named Eric Ruth.
5659000	5662000	And the game looks like it should be on the NES.
5662000	5664000	It supports up to two players.
5664000	5668000	And it's basically a PC version that is available to download right now.
5668000	5670000	So you can go find that.
5670000	5677000	I believe they have it available on... he has his own website on Google.
5677000	5684000	sites.google.com slash site slash eric david ruth
5684000	5685000	Is it a hack of a game?
5685000	5686000	No.
5686000	5691000	Slash game dash left 4 dead.
5691000	5694000	And that's just like how you would spell the actual title.
5694000	5698000	And that's available. Otherwise you could do a search in Google and probably find it.
5698000	5699000	But it's pretty cool looking.
5699000	5703000	I thought it was an NES ROM hack at first, but no. It's a PC game.
5703000	5705000	Oh, I get it. Okay.
5705000	5707000	Gotta put it on my cabinet though.
5707000	5708000	Why not?
5708000	5709000	It's two player.
5709000	5714000	Also, Rock Band on Playstation 3 is being patched.
5714000	5716000	Or Rock Band 2 I should say.
5716000	5719000	Being patched on the PS3 to make way for the Rock Band Network.
5719000	5721000	And that's kind of cool.
5721000	5725000	They're gonna actually have the Rock Band Network store in the interface.
5725000	5731000	I guess selling songs directly added by Rock Band fans.
5731000	5735000	And musicians and record labels through the new Rock Band Network.
5735000	5739000	Although I'm surprised. Is this even available right now for the Xbox?
5739000	5743000	I don't believe so. I believe they're able to start making their songs.
5743000	5748000	But I don't think they're actually... I think still in like a beta type stage.
5748000	5750000	Or a closed beta basically.
5750000	5753000	That's too bad. I wanna play some new ones.
5753000	5764000	And apparently there's the updates also adding a more robust handling of chord hammer-ons and pull-offs found in the Beatles Rock Band.
5764000	5767000	Support for SingStar wireless microphones.
5767000	5774000	And support for velocity sensitivity with the Ion Drum Rocker drums I guess.
5774000	5779000	And the ability to sort songs in quick play by the number of stars you've earned in each song.
5779000	5782000	So that should be coming very soon.
5782000	5790000	And then also Half-Life 2 on PC has a mod added to it now to update the graphics.
5790000	5797000	This is gonna be kind of on par with what we saw in Half-Life Episode 2.
5797000	5801000	Kind of like what we saw in the orange box that they released.
5801000	5805000	And the mod adds a bunch of new detail into the game.
5805000	5808000	More realistic graphics, new models, whatnot.
5808000	5809000	About damn time.
5809000	5811000	Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.
5811000	5819000	Apparently right now I believe it's just he's working on Episode 1 as well right now.
5819000	5822000	So that should be coming soon.
5822000	5827000	But it basically adds HDR, high dynamic range, lighting.
5827000	5834000	Also new updated models, textures, and 32 Steam achievements as well.
5834000	5837000	And so that's available I believe right now.
5837000	5843000	So you can probably find that on your favorite mod site or yeah it's on the Steam powered forums.
5843000	5845000	So there's a link on there somewhere.
5845000	5847000	Half-Life 2 is a pretty epic game.
5847000	5850000	I think that it should fit the play.
5850000	5853000	I'm almost surprised that they haven't released an update themselves.
5853000	5856000	Because it does look really good with the new graphics.
5856000	5860000	I'm surprised that Valve hasn't done it themselves.
5860000	5862000	But hey, someone else did.
5862000	5864000	And that's it.
5864000	5870000	Alright, well Loki brought up music games and certainly Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero still in the picture with some weekly download packs believe it or not.
5870000	5873000	They're still going strong there with the weekly download packs.
5873000	5878000	January 7th, some Blues Masters types of songs.
5878000	5883000	Tyler Bryant, Joe Bonamassa, and Scott McKeon have some new songs coming out.
5883000	5887000	January 14th is the Vampire Weekend, so if you're a fan of them.
5887000	5892000	Holiday, Cousins, and The Kids Don't Stand a Chance will all hit Band Hero and Guitar Hero 5 on the 14th.
5892000	5895000	January 21st is a metal track pack.
5895000	5897000	You get Shadows Fall with Still I Rise.
5897000	5900000	Amon Amoroth with Twilight of the Thunder God.
5900000	5904000	And get this, Deathlok with Laser Cannon Death Sentence.
5904000	5906000	So if you're a fan of Metalocalypse, you'll like that.
5906000	5908000	Dude, I fully threw up the horns for that.
5908000	5911000	And then on the 28th, Creedence Clearwater Revival.
5911000	5914000	Yeah, Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising and Traveling Band.
5914000	5915000	Sweet!
5915000	5917000	No, I totally am going to get those.
5917000	5920000	That's a very diverse lineup. We'll put it that way.
5920000	5924000	Rock Band, not to be ignored, is doing their weekly announcement as well.
5924000	5928000	And this will be available this week on the 12th of the 14th, depending on what system you're on.
5928000	5929000	It's Alice in Chains.
5929000	5930000	Some new songs by them.
5930000	5936000	Grind, Heaven Beside You, Last of My Kind, We Die Young, and Your Decision.
5936000	5938000	So if you're an Alice in Chains fan, you're happy this week.
5938000	5943000	And Microsoft has announced that Project Natal is coming this holiday season, 2010.
5943000	5946000	That was straight from the CES 2010 keynote.
5946000	5949000	I don't think that really surprises anyone though, but they are committing to that time frame.
5949000	5951000	It will be out, holiday 2010.
5951000	5954000	No official name though. It is still being called Project Natal.
5954000	5955000	That may end up being its name.
5955000	5957000	Maybe just Natal, I don't know.
5957000	5961000	But they are still calling it that, at least in their press conferences.
5961000	5963000	Hopefully they don't call it something stupid like Wii.
5963000	5965000	We'll see.
5965000	5973000	And lastly, from me, Dr. Pepper, yes the soft drink, is going to be giving away some free EA download content with their purchases.
5973000	5979000	So apparently, if you actually purchase Dr. Pepper, every bottle apparently wins something.
5979000	5985000	You can actually get whatever system and download content you want for stuff from Mass Effect 2,
5985000	5991000	Battlefield Heroes, The Sims 3, Spore, and Battlefield Bad Company 2.
5991000	5994000	Apparently they're all going to have unique download content.
5994000	5999000	So I notice they're mostly newer games, with the exception of Spore, which has been out a little while.
5999000	6002000	But I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling a few extra copies of that.
6002000	6005000	So, there you go. Dr. Sakura.
6005000	6012000	Well, Squeenix actually put out from the North American group that they are putting Mir out in the spring.
6012000	6021000	Not sure if Europe is included as well, but it's by the guy who did, well, by the group that did Cavia.
6021000	6028000	The group Cavia, sorry, I'm so tongue-tied, that did Bullet Witch and Resident Evil and Umbrella Chronicles.
6028000	6035000	There is, though, a PS3 exclusive version that's only going to be out in Japan called Nier Replicant.
6035000	6041000	And I'm actually really looking forward to this game, so I can't wait till we get it.
6041000	6044000	Well, I'm going to have to wait, but I'll look forward to it.
6044000	6052000	And then also, Squeenix is bringing out Death by Cube on Xbox Live Arcade on the 20th of this month.
6052000	6058000	It's another twin-stick, multi-directional shooter type of game.
6058000	6060000	Excuse me.
6060000	6066000	And it's actually going to be based off of a bit of Robotron and Smash TV, so that'll be pretty good.
6066000	6069000	Those are fun games. More money, more prizes, I love it.
6069000	6072000	Not to be confused with Death by Companion Cube.
6072000	6076000	No. Or Cube, as in the movie. Anyway.
6076000	6082000	Heavy Rain also has an official release date, but it's not the 16th.
6082000	6084000	It is the 23rd.
6084000	6090000	It was actually confirmed also by Sony.
6090000	6099000	So, if you pre-order the game, you get free launch date access to the first downloadable Heavy Rain Chronicles episode,
6099000	6103000	and otherwise it will be coming out later and you can pay five bucks for it then.
6103000	6112000	The European release date for that is February 14th for Mainland and February 26th for UK and Ireland.
6112000	6117000	And then, we have Xbox Live stuff.
6117000	6119000	Well, more Xbox Live stuff.
6119000	6130000	They're actually saying that the Japanese developed games are more popular than most of the US ones, except for Castle Crashers,
6130000	6139000	but the ones that have been getting the most sales have been Virtualon and Ikaruga and Triggerheart Excellica.
6139000	6146000	So, actually, if you want to look at the top ten Xbox Live arcade games, just for 2009 in order,
6146000	6153000	there's Virtualon, Oratorio Tengram, Battlefield 1943, Castle Crashers, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Trials HD,
6153000	6158000	R-Type Dimension, Shadow Complex, Ikaruga, King of Fighters 98, and Mega Man 9.
6158000	6166000	But, overall time, number one is Castle Crashers, Virtualon, Oratorio Tengram, Ikaruga, Bomberman Live, Battlefield 1943,
6166000	6171000	Triggerheart Excellica, Uno, Dracula X, Fatal Fury Special, and Res HD.
6171000	6175000	And I believe that's from Japan, though. Not here in the US.
6175000	6181000	Because I think here the list would read something like, you know, Uno. Probably.
6181000	6187000	Anyhow. Alright, if that does it for the rapid fire news tonight, then let's get to some Twitter topics.
6187000	6192000	I did want to say real quick, just to make a comment about the Xbox Live stats in Japan,
6192000	6200000	I am very proud of a game that I actually played quite often, and unfortunately didn't get as much love as I would have liked it over here.
6200000	6206000	On Games On Demand, the top game downloaded in 2009 from Japan,
6206000	6210000	Earth Defense Force 3, better known as Earth Defense Force 2017 over here.
6210000	6214000	The greatest game featuring giant ants.
6214000	6218000	Not as good as Bayonetta, though, I'm telling you. I'm telling you.
6218000	6222000	So good, in fact, I actually have four copies of this game.
6222000	6223000	Wow.
6223000	6227000	I have saved three, I was eventually going to give them out on the show at some point.
6227000	6228000	Nice.
6228000	6230000	I haven't done it yet, but they're collecting dust, so.
6230000	6231000	Soon.
6231000	6237000	Let's get to Twitter topics tonight. We ask you guys every week to send your tweets to OLR on Twitter,
6237000	6241000	about things you think we maybe missed, or topics you want us to discuss.
6241000	6244000	We have a few tweets tonight, a lot of story referrals tonight.
6244000	6248000	ActDef says, I got a couple Twitter topics for you, one of them is coming up later in the show,
6248000	6251000	but the other one has to do with Gran Turismo 5 details.
6251000	6253000	Apparently some more details came out about the game,
6253000	6257000	and it's in the February edition of the PlayStation Official Magazine.
6257000	6262000	Over 1,000 vehicles, modeled cockpits, physical and mechanical damage modeling,
6262000	6266000	indie cars and tracks included, NASCAR cars and tracks included,
6266000	6270000	up to 16 players online, high definition video uploads directly to YouTube.
6270000	6272000	That's interesting.
6272000	6276000	Multi-display rendering, head tracking, full weather and night racing on all tracks,
6276000	6279000	night and day cycle on all tracks, that's going to be a pretty intense game.
6279000	6284000	Gran Turismo 5, I'm sure that's going to be a huge thing they're going to show at E3 this year.
6284000	6285000	Moving on.
6285000	6287000	I doubt it, it's coming out in February.
6287000	6288000	Is it that soon?
6288000	6290000	No, not February, like April.
6290000	6292000	Oh wow, I didn't realize it was that soon.
6292000	6293000	Dang.
6293000	6294000	Alright, cool.
6294000	6296000	Is that just in Japan, or is that over here too?
6296000	6297000	That's over here.
6297000	6298000	Wow.
6298000	6300000	Ionotropic sent us a tweet.
6300000	6303000	Final Fantasy XIII apparently is the biggest swindle ever,
6303000	6307000	and links us to this topic of a thing that we ran on Destructoid.
6307000	6311000	It was a really negative review that came from a Hong Kong magazine.
6311000	6314000	I guess, and I'm trying to see what the name of the magazine is here,
6314000	6317000	I don't see it, but it was some magazine in Hong Kong.
6317000	6320000	They called Final Fantasy XIII the biggest joke of 2009,
6320000	6324000	saying the game is completely linary until the open area is near the end.
6324000	6326000	You can't even backtrack.
6326000	6328000	Of all the RPGs I've played in recent years,
6328000	6331000	this is the first which have been so linear that it is little more
6331000	6334000	than riding an amusement park ride.
6334000	6335000	Ouch.
6335000	6337000	They gave the game a 4 out of 10.
6337000	6340000	They gave the scenario a 2, saying it's a tearjerker.
6340000	6343000	The system a 1, saying it's such a crude system.
6343000	6345000	They gave the graphics a 9 and the sound a 7,
6345000	6348000	but then the enthusiasm was a 1.
6348000	6349000	So, I don't know if they...
6349000	6351000	Sounds like they just rate it low to get attention.
6351000	6354000	I don't know, well it worked.
6354000	6356000	So, there you go.
6356000	6360000	That was from a Hong Kong magazine that I don't see the name of here.
6360000	6362000	Maybe somebody has it in chat.
6362000	6366000	More links from our Twitter peoples.
6366000	6369000	SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that talks about a new hack glitch
6369000	6371000	on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
6371000	6376000	Apparently some players have now turned into Super Speed.
6376000	6379000	So, I guess now if you get a certain hack from Modern Warfare 2,
6379000	6382000	you can run around just as fast as possible.
6382000	6387000	And if you cheat online with this, you are an asshole.
6387000	6388000	Let's see.
6388000	6392000	Tigerclaw305 links us to this story about Rockstar San Diego.
6392000	6395000	The wives, apparently, of many of the employees are demanding
6395000	6398000	better work conditions for spouses.
6398000	6399000	This is kind of interesting.
6399000	6403000	Apparently it's an open letter that was posted on a Gamasutra blog.
6403000	6404000	Ouch.
6404000	6407000	Rockstar San Diego meets the Midnight Club series of games
6407000	6410000	and they're working on the Red Dead Revolver sequel right now.
6410000	6414000	Apparently some of the blog things are addressed in the blog.
6414000	6417000	12 plus hour workdays, six day work weeks,
6417000	6420000	cuts to medical benefits, a decline in bonuses,
6420000	6421000	and all that other stuff.
6421000	6423000	So apparently, unfortunately, the workers are not getting compensated
6423000	6425000	the way they should be.
6425000	6427000	And fortunately, in this economy, it's not that easy to quit.
6427000	6430000	But at the same time, that doesn't mean you abuse the workers.
6430000	6432000	I think if they really do have an issue, though,
6432000	6433000	they should take it up with the state board.
6433000	6436000	If they're working 12 hours, they're getting time and a half
6436000	6439000	and then double time plus.
6439000	6442000	So I wouldn't be too alarmed about that.
6442000	6445000	And you do have the option.
6445000	6446000	I mean, this is California.
6446000	6448000	We're in the freaking worker's paradise here.
6448000	6452000	But when it's mandatory hours, and unfortunately this economy,
6452000	6454000	it's not just easy to say, quick, go find something else.
6454000	6455000	There isn't a lot out there right now.
6455000	6459000	But it technically is not legal to force a mandatory overtime.
6459000	6460000	Oh, they do it. Companies do it.
6460000	6461000	They do it.
6461000	6464000	But if you protest it, they don't have to schedule you for it.
6464000	6467000	Because trust me, I have been scheduled for mandatory overtime
6467000	6469000	and I'm like, sorry, I have something else that I'm doing
6469000	6471000	and gotten out of it.
6471000	6473000	So it's law.
6473000	6476000	They cannot make you do mandatory overtime.
6476000	6477000	I don't know.
6477000	6479000	Blackwell seems to think that California's one of the states
6479000	6482000	that didn't give overtime to those doing computer programming.
6482000	6484000	I don't know if there were exceptions.
6484000	6487000	I mean, I don't work in that field, so I wouldn't know as closely.
6487000	6488000	But I don't think there's really exceptions to that.
6488000	6491000	The only way they can get out of that is if you're salaried.
6491000	6492000	Yeah.
6492000	6495000	And even so, I know at my work, they actually,
6495000	6499000	they are really, really anal on addressing your hours
6499000	6502000	because they do crack down really hard
6502000	6506000	if you've made someone work more than eight hours in a day.
6506000	6509000	Spazinator, PSN on Twitter, sends a tweet.
6509000	6513000	How about the reports of Natal possibly being gimped as a cost-cutting measure?
6513000	6516000	I don't know if you can gimp something you don't really know about.
6516000	6519000	I mean, this system has not really been put out there for the masses to consume.
6519000	6521000	I mean, they didn't put it on the show floor at E3.
6521000	6523000	It was only behind closed doors
6523000	6525000	and believed only in a demonstration capacity.
6525000	6528000	So they might gimp it, but you'll never know.
6528000	6531000	The only reason they're saying it's gimped is because they took,
6531000	6534000	there was a processor built into the camera before,
6534000	6538000	but to reduce costs, they're now using the actual Xbox 360 processor
6538000	6542000	because that's going to take 10 to 15% of the system resources
6542000	6545000	to process the Natal capture stuff.
6545000	6546000	I see.
6546000	6548000	So they're saying that the games are going to have some of their processing.
6548000	6550000	They're going to suffer because of that.
6550000	6551000	You know what, though?
6551000	6552000	Again, it's...
6552000	6555000	Yeah, but would you rather, okay, would you rather that the games,
6555000	6559000	maybe they'll have to cut corners a little bit in the games
6559000	6566000	and say Natal's like, I don't know, $79, $59 or whatever,
6566000	6571000	versus they don't cut corners in the game, project Natal is $200.
6571000	6574000	Plus that forces developers to make their games for Natal.
6574000	6578000	Like, they can't just throw on Natal controls onto existing games.
6578000	6581000	I kind of like that aspect about it, actually.
6581000	6584000	It forces programmers to make games for Natal.
6584000	6585000	You know what I mean?
6585000	6587000	Yeah, we'll see.
6587000	6590000	It's pulling the Nintendo on them if it's forcing them to do it
6590000	6594000	because, well, for the longest time, Nintendo had their own proprietary...
6594000	6597000	True, true. That was a big thing back in the day with the cartridges.
6597000	6602000	Bobby Black Wolf sends us a tweet wanting us to talk about Duke Nukem Forever.
6602000	6603000	You jerk.
6603000	6605000	And you know why I said that.
6605000	6607000	And if you don't know why I said that, you can listen to Bobby's show,
6607000	6609000	the Bobby Black Wolf show, and our little phone call at the end.
6609000	6614000	And why I do not believe Duke Nukem Forever is worthy of news coverage at all.
6614000	6615000	Yet. Right now.
6615000	6617000	At this time, no.
6617000	6621000	Until they put something actually playable out there on the E3 show floor,
6621000	6624000	and no more... I'm sick and tired of these video teases and things
6624000	6626000	that just end up changing in a couple years anyway.
6626000	6628000	Like, put your goddamn money where your mouth is.
6628000	6630000	I'm sick of talking about it.
6630000	6632000	And look, I just spent a minute now talking about it,
6632000	6634000	so please, let's move on with more stories.
6634000	6636000	Alright.
6636000	6640000	Well, there's some other fun stuff, including,
6640000	6644000	Sony is apparently increasing the storage capacity of Blu-ray Discs.
6644000	6650000	You know, the previous discs, of course, used by the PS3 were 25 gigabytes.
6650000	6654000	Now they're being expanded to 33.4 gigabytes,
6654000	6659000	meaning that, well, you can store a lot more stuff on there.
6659000	6666000	And also seeing that soon dual-layer Blu-ray Discs will become common,
6666000	6670000	and you'll be able to fit 66.8 gigabytes worth of data.
6670000	6673000	All that means is you're never going to see multi-disc games for the PS3.
6673000	6677000	It's just going to be, you know, all on the 360.
6677000	6679000	And longer cutscenes.
6679000	6685000	Longer cutscenes, more high-definition graphics, more language options.
6685000	6688000	It still doesn't fix the fact that the Blu-ray drive is kind of slow.
6688000	6690000	That's a little bit of a problem.
6690000	6693000	But hey, uncompressed, you know, textures,
6693000	6696000	you know, all sorts of fun stuff to save on processing power.
6696000	6699000	Could that mean larger installs down the line because the disc will hold more?
6699000	6701000	I'm going to have to install more to my drive?
6701000	6703000	Maybe.
6703000	6706000	That's neat, though, that they can kind of do that
6706000	6708000	and not have to release a new PlayStation 3.
6708000	6710000	I mean, I do kind of think that's a nice little feature,
6710000	6712000	is that they can kind of patch that in.
6712000	6714000	That will come in handy.
6714000	6716000	Especially when, you know, Final Fantasy 15 or whatever is on its way out
6716000	6718000	and they want to do Uber cutscenes with it.
6718000	6722000	Huge, huge rumor right now, speaking of, like, Uber games.
6722000	6726000	Apparently, it's a rumor that Blizzard is currently working on a first-person MMO.
6726000	6729000	It's coming from a French gaming site, No Frag,
6729000	6732000	saying they have a reliable source.
6732000	6734000	Everybody does.
6734000	6738000	That Blizzard's next game, you know, after Diablo and after StarCraft,
6738000	6740000	will be a first-person MMO.
6740000	6743000	You know, Blizzard apparently has been working on a new IP.
6743000	6745000	We kind of know that based off the fact that they've had some job postings
6745000	6749000	and so forth in the past, and that it's an MMO based on, again, the job postings.
6749000	6753000	So, you know, maybe there is some credibility to this.
6753000	6755000	It could be interesting if it is a first person.
6755000	6758000	They are saying the game will take place in a futuristic world
6758000	6760000	and players have two lives.
6760000	6764000	The first is kind of a Sims Online type of hub,
6764000	6767000	and then the second life is where you do fighting
6767000	6769000	and other first-person-y type stuff.
6769000	6772000	Apparently, it's weird and metaphysical.
6772000	6774000	So that could be interesting, a new IP.
6774000	6776000	I'm glad they're trying to branch out and do something new.
6776000	6777000	It's kind of risky.
6777000	6780000	But, you know, I was just talking about this with some people last night,
6780000	6783000	is that, you know, World of Warcraft is dominating as it is.
6783000	6787000	You know, Blizzard has to be thinking about their next steps in the MMO universe,
6787000	6791000	because if they want a game to come out when WoW gets old,
6791000	6793000	they need to be working on it already.
6793000	6797000	You know, because WoW is going to age out in maybe five years,
6797000	6799000	maybe less, I don't know,
6799000	6801000	and they need to be thinking about the successor to that.
6801000	6803000	But, of course, this doesn't sound like World of Warcraft 2.
6803000	6805000	This sounds like something else completely new.
6805000	6806000	Could be interesting.
6806000	6808000	Could be targeting a different audience altogether.
6808000	6810000	I don't know.
6810000	6813000	I can tell you the top-secret game I played this week
6813000	6815000	was also two very different types of modes in it.
6815000	6817000	So maybe that's the direction of MMOs.
6817000	6819000	I don't know. Maybe?
6819000	6824000	Well, in other news, this is actually kind of sad.
6824000	6827000	There is a game that is no longer going to be shipped,
6827000	6829000	no longer going to be published.
6829000	6835000	Nintendo has put the clothes on it, even though it's only been out for four months.
6835000	6839000	The Metroid Prime Collector's Edition is gone.
6839000	6842000	The only way you're going to get it is used.
6842000	6844000	It's been gone for a while, actually.
6844000	6846000	But it's officially gone.
6846000	6848000	Yeah, somebody finally contacted Nintendo this week.
6848000	6850000	What do you know, Loki?
6850000	6852000	Well, it's been moratorium for a while.
6852000	6855000	I just figured they'd stop making it.
6855000	6857000	They do that sometimes with some of their older games.
6857000	6859000	But it's been looking out for four months.
6859000	6860000	Yeah, that's weird.
6860000	6864000	Yeah, but it's just a re-release of Prime 3 and the other two games.
6864000	6869000	I get that, but at the same time, what they did to Prime 1 and 2 was new.
6869000	6871000	The whole widescreen of Wii controls.
6871000	6873000	Well, now they can re-release them separately, maybe.
6873000	6875000	I don't know.
6875000	6876000	Give them an excuse.
6876000	6878000	Hey, look, we're putting out new games.
6878000	6882000	Maybe Nintendo is finally being punished for just rehashing their GameCube shit
6882000	6884000	and releasing it with this new play control.
6884000	6887000	Well, they've stopped doing the new play control stuff.
6887000	6889000	At least I haven't seen any coming out.
6889000	6892000	Do you know how some of those other ones sold?
6892000	6894000	Prime 3 did okay, I think.
6894000	6899000	Well, the trilogy did alright for a little bit.
6899000	6901000	The other ones, I mean, it depends.
6901000	6904000	Some people picked up Pikmin and that kind of stuff.
6904000	6908000	They sold a little bit for a while, but it dropped off really quick.
6908000	6912000	It wasn't like people were buying Pikmin like it was the new Pikmin game or something like that.
6912000	6915000	Maybe it ended up being cost-effective. Who knows?
6915000	6919000	Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chat says maybe they'll do a greatest hits thing for those games.
6919000	6921000	She could buy the Wii version separate.
6921000	6925000	Even if they release those at 20 bucks apiece, the collector's edition was a better deal.
6925000	6928000	To get all three of them for what, like 40 or whatever it was?
6928000	6929000	Pretty much.
6929000	6931000	The only reason I didn't get it is because I already owned three
6931000	6934000	and I wasn't that attached to the Metroid series where I wanted to buy 1 and 2.
6934000	6936000	Because I just...
6936000	6937000	It's not high def.
6937000	6940000	Don't you have the GameCube versions anyways?
6940000	6943000	No, those were my roommate's games at the time.
6943000	6945000	Those were Extra First games, not mine.
6945000	6947000	He was the big fan of Metroid.
6947000	6949000	I do have the third one though. I did like Metroid Prime 3.
6949000	6951000	I just, you know, I wasn't as into it.
6951000	6954000	I think this other M is going to be more up my alley.
6954000	6956000	I like the 2D thing.
6956000	6960000	See, I was thinking that, it's like you were saying, not being cost-effective.
6960000	6963000	A lot of people maybe already had these games, were disillusioned.
6963000	6971000	If profit doesn't match output for cost, then it makes perfect sense for them to get rid of it.
6971000	6974000	I hate to say it, Nintendo should be slapped on the wrist for that.
6974000	6978000	I mean, I think they were trying to milk the cash cow there without changing the games enough.
6978000	6982000	I mean, what they did with Metroid and the white series, it was a little better.
6982000	6983000	And I think they did that for some of the other games.
6983000	6984000	It just wasn't enough.
6984000	6986000	Where's the online play?
6986000	6988000	You did it in the DS one.
6988000	6990000	This is not enough.
6990000	6994000	Anyhow, more news.
6994000	6996000	Some other fun stuff.
6996000	7002000	Let's see.
7002000	7004000	Let's see here. Sorry about that.
7004000	7007000	Another thing that came out of CES.
7007000	7010000	The Xbox 360 media room.
7010000	7013000	It's kind of like an IPTV thing that they've got.
7013000	7019000	And I believe they talked a little bit about that, or at least it was rumored at last CES.
7019000	7021000	That they were possibly going to go that way.
7021000	7029000	But this is going to be something that's going to be offered with, or I should say, for AT&T U-verse subscribers.
7029000	7035000	And they'll allow you to have access to some of these new channels that are going to be available through that.
7035000	7040000	And I guess right now, I don't know, I think U-verse is in my area.
7040000	7043000	But I haven't really jumped on that yet.
7043000	7046000	I don't know if they have the U-verse internet in my area.
7046000	7048000	I think that's what it is.
7048000	7052000	Anyways, and they're going to have that coming out later this year.
7052000	7056000	And apparently any of the subscribers to U-verse will have access to this.
7056000	7060000	I think you also probably have to have their internet as well.
7060000	7062000	But it's kind of neat.
7062000	7067000	They didn't really say a whole lot about it, but there's going to be a lot of limitations on there.
7067000	7072000	You're not going to be able to record any of the programming on there with a DVR.
7072000	7077000	You're not going to be able to get access to all the different stations and stuff.
7077000	7083000	I mean, if it doesn't cost anything additional, then that wouldn't be too horrible, I guess.
7083000	7086000	I don't know.
7086000	7089000	I like that at least there's starting to be more choices.
7089000	7094000	Because I felt like for TV for the longest time, if you want a cable-type thing, you really only have Comcast.
7094000	7098000	Now there's this AT&T thing that's... I'm all for competition, you know?
7098000	7102000	Yeah, I need the FiOS stuff to get here.
7102000	7104000	Because that's going to be awesome.
7104000	7108000	Twice the speed that Comcast downloads.
7108000	7113000	Alright, speaking of an all-in-one, everything built in on the Wii,
7113000	7116000	Nyko, of course, releases some third-party controllers for the Wii.
7116000	7120000	I usually see them at E3. They do the big inflatable Wii controls and stuff.
7120000	7128000	Well, the Luan that they released last time was pretty sweet with the ability to link up with their gun controller or whatever like that.
7128000	7131000	It'd be directly attached to it and stuff.
7131000	7135000	It's a little device that pushes the button on the controller.
7135000	7139000	Well, this year, what they're putting out is a $40 wand.
7139000	7141000	The wand is the name of their controller.
7141000	7146000	It is a Wiimote, basically, that includes MotionPlus inside it.
7146000	7151000	And it also does all the transport stuff that Loki's talking about, what the wand did before.
7151000	7157000	But apparently now you will get to have the WiimotionPlus built in, so you don't have to buy an extra adapter for it.
7157000	7162000	That's pretty awesome, and for the same price as a normal remote, why wouldn't you buy that?
7162000	7164000	The controller doesn't look that bad.
7164000	7166000	No, it's not a bad looking thing at all.
7166000	7169000	It looks like the same layout and everything.
7169000	7173000	I mean, unless you have to have the Nintendo made one. I don't know why.
7173000	7175000	I'm surprised Nintendo...
7175000	7176000	Might not be a bad deal.
7176000	7178000	I wonder if they're taking this well.
7178000	7182000	Well, maybe you just want Wii Play really bad. I don't know.
7182000	7187000	Alright, one segment I want to get to really bad is the part where our listeners email us.
7187000	7190000	It's the mailbag segment that we do every week here on the show.
7190000	7192000	So Dark Sakura's going to dive in headfirst to our mailbag.
7192000	7194000	Again, the address to send us emails.
7194000	7198000	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7198000	7200000	Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7200000	7201000	Don't be shy. Email us.
7201000	7203000	Mailbag's been kind of dry the past few weeks. I don't know.
7203000	7206000	We'll see if there's anything there tonight. Dark Sakura?
7206000	7208000	The first one comes from Redertainment.
7208000	7215000	Dear OLR, I was listening to the 12609 show we talked about the Xbox Live avatar pets and thought you might like to be made aware of something.
7215000	7222000	Last summer, Major Nelson sent out a tweet compelling people to get the word out that Final Fantasy 13 is on Xbox 360.
7222000	7226000	I was among the people who participated in this free marketing campaign.
7226000	7231000	Recently, Microsoft sent out tokens to people who participated in the campaign, including me.
7231000	7234000	This token got me a free avatar pet, a chocobo.
7234000	7239000	A tiny yellow chocobo, which is indistinguishable from a newborn chick.
7239000	7243000	All this chocobo does is show up, fly around my head, and delight my avatar.
7243000	7246000	If I had not gotten this for free, I would not have paid for it.
7246000	7248000	However, I am grateful to have it.
7248000	7254000	I'm sure this means chocobo 360 avatar pets will enhance my enjoyment of Final Fantasy 13 on PS3.
7254000	7257000	Staycare Redertainment.
7257000	7260000	This message has been brought to you by the simple truth of Dark Sakura.
7260000	7264000	Boobies are fun in need.
7264000	7266000	Boobies are great fun.
7266000	7267000	They are.
7267000	7269000	We only got one other email.
7269000	7273000	Hey OLR, the mailbag has been dry the past few months so I thought I would write.
7273000	7278000	I've been listening to the show for a few years and had to stop listening live due to me moving to a rural area.
7278000	7282000	And I have shitty satellite internet.
7282000	7284000	Sucks because I had three months of live left.
7284000	7291000	Oh well, I was listening to your first episode of the new year and the whole Windows mobile integrating to Xbox Live.
7291000	7294000	You guys didn't think much of it, but think about it.
7294000	7297000	Most video game characters use some sort of device in game.
7297000	7303000	Your phone could replace any one of those devices from Snakes, Kodak, Nettle Your Solid coming to Xbox I guess.
7303000	7306000	To a PIP boy or whatever.
7306000	7315000	Plus with Natal, which I actually don't think will be most things they promise it to be, it could be interesting.
7315000	7326000	Anyway, I read in my RSS feed today that Microsoft just allowed Razer, you know the ones who make the morbidly expensive PC peripherals, to make and sell a controller and headset.
7326000	7328000	Seriously, what the fuck.
7328000	7331000	They just stopped Natal from getting on their share of the market.
7331000	7336000	I understand that it's a different category of product, but it still seems like a dick move on Microsoft's part.
7336000	7340000	If you don't mind a short rant, continue. If you get careless, please skip to the end.
7340000	7341000	It's not that long.
7341000	7343000	Okay, you're still reading this, so what the heck.
7343000	7346000	I'm kind of pissed about how cheap people are getting about their games.
7346000	7350000	Not so much the development aspect of it, but the materials they actually give you.
7350000	7352000	First, the cases started getting super cheap.
7352000	7357000	See this BluRay case, the same style is also coming out to Xbox 360 boxes very soon.
7357000	7358000	Let me pull it up.
7358000	7359000	Oh yeah.
7359000	7361000	You see these?
7361000	7364000	Oh yeah, I heard about that, that the boxes are going to change. Okay.
7364000	7367000	I'm actually going to link this in chat real quick while I'm thinking about it.
7367000	7374000	And going back to the email.
7374000	7380000	Another thing that follows this trend is releasing bonus content is download content, yeah.
7380000	7386000	Yeah, yeah, this is the digital agent all, but it's not really fair to people like me who can't get online.
7386000	7392000	I just got Gears 2 GOTY edition and the included quote,
7392000	7396000	multiplayer maps, which I could care less about in the extra campaign chapter,
7396000	7401000	which is the reason I waited for the GOTY edition, were just a code for me to download online.
7401000	7404000	Even Gears 1 platform had the bonus content on a disc.
7404000	7408000	If I have to shell out 60 bucks for a game, at least give me what I deserve.
7408000	7411000	Anyway, this email is getting pretty lengthy, so I'll stop it here.
7411000	7416000	Keep Up The Great Show from Tiberius Jones.
7416000	7417000	Well, thank you very much for the email.
7417000	7418000	I recognize that name.
7418000	7422000	Somebody used to email us a while ago, so I guess that explains why it stopped happening.
7422000	7424000	Good to hear from you again.
7424000	7426000	Yeah.
7426000	7428000	You know, I get the whole mobile integration thing,
7428000	7433000	but I think a lot of the things you were kind of referencing there would like the whole like see something on your phone.
7433000	7436000	I don't think there's the processing power behind it.
7436000	7439000	I mean, do you remember when they came out and announced the PlayStation 3?
7439000	7443000	They were like, it's going to interface with the PSP, and you can use it as like their rear view mirror in Ridge Racer.
7443000	7444000	Ridge Racer!
7444000	7445000	That was lame.
7445000	7446000	That never happened.
7446000	7447000	It was a stupid idea, too.
7447000	7454000	But I will say, they have done some neat integration where I can log on to my PlayStation 3 from my PSP
7454000	7458000	and like look at videos and even play some certain games across the internet.
7458000	7460000	So some of that integration would be cool,
7460000	7465000	but I just think a mobile phone doesn't have that same oomph that a dedicated gaming device does.
7465000	7468000	Kind of back to something similar that I did say last week,
7468000	7472000	I think what you would see that's a little more practical is that, you know, the phone has some type of game
7472000	7476000	that enhances the experience of a console game.
7476000	7479000	Like, you know, Fable II Pub Games comes to mind,
7479000	7483000	but not anything really, I think, that integrated.
7483000	7485000	I just don't think mobile phones have that kind of power.
7485000	7487000	But I could be wrong.
7487000	7488000	My iPhone has fun gaming.
7488000	7492000	Yeah, but even iPhone games have their own problems.
7492000	7494000	A lot of frame rate issues in a lot of those games, you know.
7494000	7496000	Maybe it's just my phone. I don't know.
7496000	7498000	Alright, well thanks for the e-mails.
7498000	7500000	If you have more mail, you can always send us e-mails.
7500000	7502000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7502000	7505000	But in the meantime, while we wait for your e-mails,
7505000	7507000	we're going to need to get a little bit angsty on the show.
7507000	7511000	Thankfully, we don't have any stupid moron to inspire our FUs this week,
7511000	7529000	but that doesn't mean we're not going to let out the angst.
7529000	7532000	I have one. The waiting game. That's it.
7532000	7535000	Loki.
7535000	7538000	My FU goes to people that play on Xbox Live
7538000	7542000	and decide to drop because you suck or you're losing.
7542000	7544000	I mean, come on.
7544000	7548000	At least in Grand Theft Auto, any score that you're getting
7548000	7552000	is still going to count toward your rank, even if you suck.
7552000	7554000	I don't understand what the point is in dropping
7554000	7555000	because you know what happens when you drop?
7555000	7559000	I rate you down anyways, so fuck you.
7559000	7563000	More people should use that rating system, honestly.
7563000	7566000	I have been now everybody that drops, and trust me, it's a lot.
7566000	7568000	It's a few per game every time,
7568000	7572000	and it's rare when we get people to actually stick in there.
7572000	7576000	Occasionally, we drop, but that's because our internet connection at work sucks,
7576000	7579000	and it just randomly kicks us out,
7579000	7582000	not us quitting on purpose like some people do.
7582000	7584000	Unfortunately, you probably get rated down for quitting on purpose,
7584000	7585000	even though you didn't.
7585000	7588000	No, I am rated down 8% by people,
7588000	7590000	and it's for aggressive.
7590000	7594000	They said it's unsportsmanlike behavior or something like that,
7594000	7596000	basically saying that I'm being too aggressive.
7596000	7599000	That's usually for trash talking, but I don't use a headset.
7599000	7600000	Fascinating.
7600000	7602000	There is no trash talking.
7602000	7603000	I'm just kicking their ass.
7603000	7604000	What a bunch of dicks.
7604000	7605000	Babies.
7605000	7609000	Seriously, look at the pussies whining to their mommy.
7609000	7611000	There should be some type of check and balance for that
7611000	7613000	for people who abuse that system.
7613000	7614000	I don't really have a lot of FUs.
7614000	7618000	Just FU to like chaos.
7618000	7619000	Otherwise, things are fine.
7619000	7621000	I don't have a lot to be angsty about.
7621000	7624000	All right, a couple more stories for you guys,
7624000	7626000	and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
7626000	7630000	but there's some stories still, so Loki.
7630000	7632000	This is kind of interesting.
7632000	7637000	There's a new patent that Microsoft, I guess, is a part of
7637000	7643000	that's for muscle control controllers, I guess.
7643000	7645000	The EMG muscle controllers.
7645000	7650000	What it is is basically a device that you would put on your arm
7650000	7656000	or something that would detect the impulses from your nerves
7656000	7658000	going to your different muscles.
7658000	7662000	So, for example, one of the examples that they show
7662000	7667000	is someone playing Guitar Hero using just their hand.
7667000	7670000	It's basically the movements and the motions of pushing
7670000	7673000	the different fret buttons are actually causing
7673000	7679000	the different fret buttons to hit in the game.
7679000	7681000	This could be something that may be tied in with Natal
7681000	7682000	later on or something like that.
7682000	7684000	Yeah, I was going to say, the way you describe it,
7684000	7685000	it sounds like a Natal thing.
7685000	7688000	Natal should be the thing that sees my fingers
7688000	7691000	and how I'm moving and all that.
7691000	7693000	That's kind of the way they're advertising it.
7693000	7695000	It almost sounds like it shouldn't have to be this whole
7695000	7698000	separate thing, but Natal should just know I have a guitar.
7698000	7699000	I don't know.
7699000	7700000	Yeah.
7700000	7703000	So, I don't know.
7703000	7706000	But apparently, Natal is supposed to detect movement
7706000	7710000	of at least 31 different parts of your body.
7710000	7713000	So, I don't know if it's really necessary.
7713000	7715000	Maybe something else that they're working on.
7715000	7716000	Whatever.
7716000	7720000	If it works, it's cheap.
7720000	7722000	I don't know if Air Guitar Hero would be as fun.
7722000	7724000	There's something about the plastic guitar that is charming.
7724000	7726000	I think it's just proof of concept stuff.
7726000	7731000	I don't think they would actually use it for something like that.
7731000	7735000	True, because Guitar Hero is a third-party game anyway.
7735000	7737000	It's not something that's really done by Microsoft.
7737000	7738000	It would feel weird.
7738000	7743000	It would feel really weird just kind of moving your fingers.
7743000	7747000	One more story for you guys, and it's about the PlayStation Network.
7747000	7750000	Another survey, and I've seen a story like this before,
7750000	7753000	but this is yet another survey that's talking about
7753000	7756000	subscription-based features on the PlayStation Network.
7756000	7759000	This is a survey that went out to UK PlayStation Network members,
7759000	7765000	asking them about possible subscription models for the service.
7765000	7768000	The market research company that's running this is called IPsauce,
7768000	7773000	IPsauce, and some of the benefits that they mention in here.
7773000	7774000	Let's see.
7774000	7775000	Full title trials.
7775000	7776000	First hour is free.
7776000	7778000	So, imagine if you could actually download a full game
7778000	7780000	and play it for an hour for free.
7780000	7782000	Cross-game voice chat access.
7782000	7784000	I know that's come up before.
7784000	7787000	Member demo sharing a full game.
7787000	7789000	Not quite sure what that means.
7789000	7792000	Maybe that means that you could send a demo to somebody,
7792000	7794000	but maybe that's probably this full title trial.
7794000	7798000	Something that strikes me as interesting, token wagering.
7798000	7800000	Is that like legalized gambling of some sort?
7800000	7803000	Something like that sounds like strange.
7803000	7805000	User-to-user challenges.
7805000	7808000	Maybe like user-generated trophies.
7808000	7811000	Early access to all store content.
7811000	7813000	Well, that's really no different than what they do on Xbox.
7813000	7815000	And then this is also what I think is very interesting.
7815000	7822000	Free access to PS1 classics, PSP minis, and PS3 PSP themes.
7822000	7824000	So, imagine if you got a subscription service
7824000	7827000	to suddenly let you play all the PS1 games you wanted.
7827000	7830000	I wonder if that would be something you would want to go.
7830000	7833000	Anyway, some of the price options that they're talking about,
7833000	7840000	as low as 2.99 pounds, which would be about $5 US,
7840000	7844000	up to $14.99 in the pounds, which would be about $25.
7844000	7846000	That would be a monthly fee.
7846000	7848000	Also, some annual fees listed there,
7848000	7853000	up between $32 to $160 would be the range there.
7853000	7856000	Now, these don't necessarily mean it's true.
7856000	7859000	Again, the marketing firm could have come up with some of this,
7859000	7861000	but it means Sony's thinking about it.
7861000	7863000	But at the same time, and I've said this before
7863000	7864000	when the story's come up before,
7864000	7867000	it's not like Sony doesn't already have pay for bonus content.
7867000	7869000	It's called Core.
7869000	7870000	But it's interesting.
7870000	7871000	Some of these features they're talking about,
7871000	7873000	especially the token wagering,
7873000	7875000	I want to know more about what that's all about,
7875000	7877000	and the whole subscription-based PS1 classics.
7877000	7880000	It would be nice if you'd do some PS2 in there as well,
7880000	7882000	being a part of this.
7882000	7884000	Loki, do you think some of this might be worth paying for,
7884000	7886000	or are you just saying, yeah, forget it?
7886000	7888000	I'm not paying for any of this crap.
7888000	7891000	I don't play the PlayStation Network enough as it is,
7891000	7893000	or play on the PlayStation Network.
7893000	7895000	In fact, I don't think I've ever played on the PlayStation Network
7895000	7896000	with someone else.
7896000	7898000	Maybe in Little Big Planet once.
7898000	7900000	But I'm not paying for any of this.
7900000	7901000	I'm sorry.
7901000	7903000	It does not seem like anything I'm interested in,
7903000	7904000	and I don't care how much it is.
7904000	7905000	I'm not paying for it.
7905000	7906000	Game Guru says,
7906000	7908000	again, if PlayStation Network goes subscription-based,
7908000	7912000	there will likely be no reason for gamers to choose it over Xbox Live.
7912000	7913000	I don't know.
7913000	7915000	I think you might be jumping the gun a little bit,
7915000	7918000	because they're not talking about taking anything away.
7918000	7920000	So I don't think they're talking about
7920000	7922000	that now you're going to have to pay to play games online.
7922000	7923000	I don't think you could...
7923000	7925000	I don't know if that would be possible,
7925000	7927000	because of the games that are already out there.
7927000	7929000	I don't think you could tell those games to suddenly not play online.
7929000	7930000	I don't know.
7930000	7934000	But maybe they're talking about trying to enhance it.
7934000	7936000	And this could all just tie into core.
7936000	7938000	A core membership.
7938000	7939000	Who knows?
7939000	7942000	And Nat Elias, I hope I said that right,
7942000	7945000	says, as long as there's a free alternative, I'm cool with it.
7945000	7948000	So again, the survey doesn't say anything about taking anything away.
7948000	7951000	So I don't think PlayStation Network, as you know it today, will change.
7951000	7953000	But maybe they'll just try to get more money out of you
7953000	7955000	by throwing extra stuff your way.
7955000	7956000	I just don't care.
7956000	7960000	I'm just not playing that much on the PlayStation Network
7960000	7962000	to where this would be beneficial to me.
7962000	7968000	I mean, if a PlayStation 3 was all I had, then maybe.
7968000	7970000	But I think people are so used to free now
7970000	7976000	that trying to get them to pay extra for this might not work.
7976000	7978000	And it obviously is going to be coming,
7978000	7980000	because all these stupid surveys come true.
7980000	7982000	We've seen too many of these now.
7982000	7983000	Something's coming.
7983000	7985000	And we'll hear about it at E3.
7985000	7986000	Yes, we will.
7986000	7988000	All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.
7988000	7991000	1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can send your phone calls.
7991000	7994000	Or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.
7994000	7996000	If you've never called the show before,
7996000	8001000	please dial ECHO 1-2-3 first before you give us a call.
8001000	8003000	That's ECHO 1-2-3.
8003000	8006000	And then that way you can make sure your connection is working right.
8006000	8007000	Let's go to the phones.
8007000	8009000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8009000	8011000	Hi, this is GS68.
8011000	8014000	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?
8014000	8017000	I got an FC Mobile 2 this weekend.
8017000	8020000	I just had to give it a try.
8020000	8024000	My thoughts on it went down the more I played it, to be honest.
8024000	8026000	Really?
8026000	8028000	Like, for one, the system's pretty thick.
8028000	8031000	I mean, I'll kind of excuse that,
8031000	8035000	since it needs the thickness to accommodate the NES cartridges.
8035000	8039000	But, like, after about playing for about five minutes,
8039000	8042000	my hands started to get sore.
8042000	8045000	I could feel the soreness lingering, like,
8045000	8047000	hours after I had played it.
8047000	8050000	So is it just not, I don't know, ergonomically well-made,
8050000	8052000	or what's the deal?
8052000	8055000	It's probably just not ergonomically well-made with it being very thick.
8055000	8057000	I see.
8057000	8060000	And then the D-pad is, like, not too great either.
8060000	8062000	Like, for one, it's PSP style D-pad,
8062000	8065000	and I hate those kind of D-pads.
8065000	8069000	Also, the D-pad piece is split in half diagonally.
8069000	8073000	So sometimes it's more action-type of games,
8073000	8076000	like Xanax and Legend of Zelda.
8076000	8078000	But on the plus side, that means they can do some weird glitches,
8078000	8081000	like pressing left and right at the same time in Zelda 2,
8081000	8083000	causing Link to slide around all over the place.
8083000	8085000	Fun.
8085000	8088000	And then it comes with wireless controllers,
8088000	8091000	and I tried those, and those were more comfortable to hold,
8091000	8094000	but I found the D-pads were pretty crappy, too.
8094000	8098000	Like, instead of having what I call PSP D-pad syndrome,
8098000	8100000	they now have 360 D-pad syndrome,
8100000	8102000	where they have the tendency to press the wrong direction.
8102000	8104000	Yeah.
8104000	8106000	Boy, those 360 D-pads are pretty terrible.
8106000	8108000	Why is it so hard to make a D-pad?
8108000	8110000	That's my question.
8110000	8112000	I don't know.
8112000	8114000	Although, I don't know. I didn't have the same experience as you.
8114000	8116000	I didn't find the D-pad to be that terrible on the FC Mobile,
8116000	8118000	but that's just me.
8118000	8123000	Maybe the quality varies from unit to unit. I don't know.
8123000	8127000	I also have really fat thumbs that could play into it. I don't know.
8127000	8129000	No idea.
8129000	8131000	What kind of games are you playing?
8131000	8133000	The classic stuff. I know you said Zelda,
8133000	8135000	but what other classics are you enjoying?
8135000	8137000	I was also playing Xanac,
8137000	8140000	which is a shoot-em-up by the same people behind the Guardian Legend.
8140000	8143000	Nice. Guardian Legend is a must.
8143000	8147000	Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?
8147000	8151000	Yeah, I got around to playing Castle of Unity Adventure Reapers.
8151000	8155000	Oh, I played that a little bit on Wii, as well. What'd you think?
8155000	8158000	I like it so far.
8158000	8162000	I mean, it's about time we finally got a new classic-vania game,
8162000	8164000	as some of the families like to call it.
8164000	8167000	Yeah, it feels very much like a classic Castlevania game.
8167000	8171000	It was like a very Castlevania 3-esque game, which makes sense.
8171000	8173000	It's a remake of the Game Boy games.
8173000	8176000	But, you know, yeah, I kind of felt the same way.
8176000	8182000	And what I like is that you can choose between normal jumping and classic jumping.
8182000	8186000	And, honestly, I like classic jumping better, because when I play normal,
8186000	8190000	like, jumping things are kind of weird, especially for classic-vania games.
8190000	8192000	Like, it tends to throw me off.
8192000	8193000	Like, I'll try to...
8193000	8197000	Like, I'll jump, and I'll press D by the other way and hit the whip button,
8197000	8200000	so that way I can whip in the opposite direction when I'm jumping,
8200000	8204000	but I'm moving backwards instead, which kind of throws me off
8204000	8207000	and causes me to do stuff I didn't intend to do.
8207000	8210000	It's still challenging, though. Castlevania is still a very challenging game.
8210000	8212000	But, yeah, a lot of folks might have missed that that came out.
8212000	8215000	There's been a lot of those rebirth-type of games that came out between,
8215000	8219000	what, Contra, I think, Gradius, and now this Castlevania.
8219000	8222000	Oh, and I've been noticing that some people have been complaining
8222000	8225000	about the lack of a save feature or suspend feature.
8225000	8227000	There is a stage select.
8227000	8231000	If you go to the tile menu, select Game Start and hold right for a few seconds,
8231000	8233000	and go to Stage Select.
8233000	8235000	Oh, nice. Little pro tip.
8235000	8238000	That's, like, the type of thing I would have read in Nintendo Power.
8238000	8242000	All right, well, GS68, have fun with your FC Mobile,
8242000	8244000	and maybe hopefully it'll get a little more comfortable,
8244000	8246000	and good luck with Castlevania.
8246000	8247000	All right.
8247000	8248000	All right, take care, buddy.
8248000	8249000	You too.
8249000	8250000	Bye-bye.
8250000	8252000	877-GAMO-LR is the number to call her.
8252000	8256000	Her username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8256000	8258000	Let's go to the phones.
8258000	8260000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8260000	8262000	Hey, what's up? It's Rama.
8262000	8263000	What's up, Rama?
8263000	8265000	Not too much, not too much.
8265000	8267000	Call to give a nice little game review.
8267000	8268000	Yeah, what game?
8268000	8270000	Pop It Music for the Week.
8270000	8274000	Really? Now, I've heard a lot of kind of bullshit about this game,
8274000	8279000	but looking at your Twitter, you seem to be a little more positive on this, yeah?
8279000	8282000	Yeah, because you have to understand, on the average gamer,
8282000	8285000	and I've come to determine it, because a lot of these Be Money games,
8285000	8290000	when people kind of shit on said Be Money game that comes to the U.S.,
8290000	8294000	9 out of 10, they're just mad because the Japanese music
8294000	8298000	that they loved in the arcade or import versions out on the U.S. release.
8298000	8302000	Okay, I gotcha. You know, I didn't mind.
8302000	8305000	I thought some of the early DDR releases were kind of crap,
8305000	8308000	but I think one of the best DDR releases they ever did
8308000	8310000	was one of the American ones, Ultra Mix 2.
8310000	8312000	I think that was probably one of the best DDRs they ever did,
8312000	8315000	and I don't think BeatMania for the U.S. was terrible.
8315000	8317000	I think they tried to do some cool things with it.
8317000	8319000	It's a bummer they didn't get to do a sequel.
8319000	8323000	Yeah, I enjoyed BeatMania for PS. I really enjoyed that, so you know.
8323000	8325000	But now Poppin' Music I was a little apprehensive about,
8325000	8330000	because A, it's the Wii, and B, Beaten Groovy was so fucking terrible,
8330000	8334000	but how does Poppin' Music make it better?
8334000	8338000	First things first, we never mention Beaten Groovy again.
8338000	8340000	It's on the list of band names.
8340000	8342000	I apologize.
8342000	8345000	No problem. Poppin' Music Wii is a little bit different.
8345000	8350000	Instead of like 7 and 9 button control, if I remember correctly,
8350000	8355000	you have 5 button control, and you use the Wiimote and the chuck,
8355000	8361000	and you have to pretty much shake in a direction in order to hit the colors.
8361000	8367000	Now, if you shake the controllers to your side, that's hitting the outer green buttons.
8367000	8372000	If you shake on like a 45 degree angle, or straight ahead,
8372000	8377000	you hit the middle blue buttons, and if you move the Wiimote or the chuck
8377000	8382000	with one, you know, to your left or to your right, you hit the center red button.
8382000	8387000	Also, if you hit them both together, cross like an X, you can also hit it at the red button as well.
8387000	8389000	That sounds terrible. I'm sorry.
8389000	8393000	Well, how does it play? I mean, it might sound bad, but does it play well?
8393000	8398000	To me, it's kind of like a cross between playing Para Para or Samba de Amigo.
8398000	8400000	I can see the samba. I can see that.
8400000	8405000	How's the song list? Is it very Japanese-centric, or did they Americanize it? What did they do?
8405000	8411000	They Americanized it, but there's some downloadable content which does have Japanese songs on it.
8411000	8414000	Like, one of my favorite songs is Miracle Moon.
8414000	8419000	So I'm really excited about getting a chance to download that song, actually.
8419000	8421000	Oh, they have download content?
8421000	8422000	Yeah.
8422000	8424000	Oh, wow. Okay. Cool.
8424000	8427000	Are there a lot of songs that longtime Bamani fans will recognize?
8427000	8430000	I know Miracle Moon, obviously. Other stuff like that?
8430000	8435000	I don't remember a couple of the other ones, but there are some familiar ones in there.
8435000	8442000	I did write on my Twitter about some of the bands' names I saw when I was browsing through the downloadable content.
8442000	8445000	Is there a lot of downloadable content?
8445000	8459000	I believe there's like 20 downloadable songs. There's 10 different topics. Each topic has two songs.
8459000	8466000	And pretty much the majority of them are Japanese songs from pop and music games, and I think BeatMania, but don't hold me to that.
8466000	8473000	Well, thanks for the reminder that the game was even out, because I forgot, so I guess maybe it's not as bad as a lot of people are saying it's going to be, huh?
8473000	8481000	Yeah, you gotta thank Twitter for that. If it was for one of my friends who was at best by matching it, I wouldn't have known to go over to go purchase it.
8481000	8485000	Interesting. Anything else in your gaming league you want to talk about?
8485000	8494000	That's pretty much it. I will be playing Lost Odyssey later tonight before I go to bed, but I'll say this much.
8494000	8501000	Pop and music was 29. I personally thought it was a good game to purchase. If it was more than that, I probably would not have bothered.
8501000	8514000	And there's also a two-player and four-player mode. Four-player mode is pretty much you have all nine of the buttons out, and I think four-player mode has all the buttons, but each person takes a remote to hit the correct button.
8514000	8516000	Interesting.
8516000	8517000	Yeah.
8517000	8520000	Alright, well, DJ Rama, we're going to let you go.
8520000	8525000	I actually wanted to say, I was thinking about you right before you called, seriously.
8525000	8527000	We must be on the same wavelength.
8527000	8531000	Seriously, about last time you were here and we went to Japantown.
8531000	8532000	Yeah.
8532000	8535000	I mean, no, not Japantown, where we were at Fonamy.
8535000	8536000	Right, yeah.
8536000	8540000	Because it was something about the dealer's room, and then beep, and you called, and then I forgot what it was.
8540000	8544000	I thought it was funny.
8544000	8548000	I'm just reminded when we played on Dance Maniacs together. That was the first time I ever played that.
8548000	8552000	That game is fun. Crazy fun. I love playing in marathon mode.
8552000	8557000	Well, if things go according to plan they show, it may just happen again.
8557000	8558000	Hope so.
8558000	8560000	Definitely.
8560000	8565000	Well, we hope to see you soon, DJ Rama, and tell them we'll just rely on the phone calls, okay?
8565000	8566000	You got it.
8566000	8569000	Alright, take care, buddy. Have fun now popping music-ing away.
8569000	8570000	I will.
8570000	8571000	Later.
8571000	8574000	1877 Game OLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8574000	8577000	I guess we'll do about one more call here tonight before we go.
8577000	8579000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8579000	8580000	It's Legend of Zaku.
8580000	8582000	Hey, Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy?
8582000	8587000	Nothing much. Just killing another Sunday evening before going back to work.
8587000	8591000	I hear you. We don't mind people killing time with us. What's on your mind?
8591000	8599000	Nothing much. Just taking care of the usual stuff, the little gems that I found from Consumer Electronics Show regarding gaming.
8599000	8602000	Especially the 3D setups that they had for certain games.
8602000	8607000	What do you think about this whole 3D TV? We talked about it a little bit earlier in the show with Avatar and stuff. What do you think?
8607000	8613000	I mean, if 3D is going to make a comeback, it better be implemented right this time.
8613000	8617000	Not that red and blue stuff. Not that red and blue shit.
8617000	8622000	It has to be 3D that you can actually see in the actual colors.
8622000	8625000	Well, the technology has come a long way, to be fair.
8625000	8630000	I mean, you have to keep in mind, not every game is meant for 3D anyways.
8630000	8639000	Case in point, some of them, like Gran Turismo 5, which they did a tech demo over the course of the Expo where they had it in 3D and it added nothing.
8639000	8642000	And absolutely nothing to the experience.
8642000	8649000	Whereas games such as Gears or, I think it was, I want to say it was some other games.
8649000	8656000	I think one of them, yeah, the new one coming out, Dark Void, that one had a 3D demo, you know, CES.
8656000	8660000	And that one pretty much made the experience a lot better.
8660000	8664000	So the mileage may vary, pretty much.
8664000	8668000	What about Game Room? What did you think about that?
8668000	8672000	Oh, the new thing for Xbox Live?
8672000	8680000	Oh, yeah, I heard about that. I mean, I've been detached from my 360 for quite some time, but I did hear about the...
8680000	8685000	I don't know, I guess it's just Microsoft trying to emulate home.
8685000	8687000	That's the way I see it.
8687000	8689000	I think it's kind of a combination of home and virtual console.
8689000	8692000	I hear a lot of people comparing it to home, but I think there's also a lot of virtual console.
8692000	8694000	I think some of the things people have been asking for...
8694000	8702000	The way you see it is just them rendering a virtual arcade that Sony could easily dreamt of already baked into their home app.
8702000	8708000	That's pretty much it. All they're doing, Microsoft is just dressing up and taking from what Sony's already done.
8708000	8710000	And making it better.
8710000	8712000	You know, already in the past.
8712000	8723000	And another thing I want to talk about, you said earlier that certain phones were designed for the social networking aspects within video games.
8723000	8732000	Right now, there's a shift going on within mobile devices.
8732000	8740000	Obviously, the iPhone was the catalyst for it, but you have platforms like Android, Windows Mobile, Blackberry...
8740000	8745000	All of them are not your cheap, run-of-the-mills cell phone platform, and they're pretty robust.
8745000	8750000	I mean, I would know, because I work with most of them professionally.
8750000	8757000	So their world's better than the phones that I used to work in when I graduated college almost four years ago.
8757000	8764000	I got that, but again, I look at something like the PSP, which is a dedicated game system, and they still have yet to pull off the...
8764000	8771000	And I'm not talking about... I get if they build something separate on the phone that ties into the game somehow.
8771000	8774000	Again, I give the pub games example.
8774000	8781000	But this whole, like, you are going to actually... Because in the email it kind of talked about, imagine you're Solid Snake and you can whip out your phone and something happens on your phone.
8781000	8786000	I'm like, I don't see that level of integration happening on phones, period, yet.
8786000	8789000	I mean, it can be done. I mean, it all depends on the platform.
8789000	8799000	Case in point, Android. For example, you can actually run multiple apps, apps that actually support push, that can run while your phone is running in the background.
8799000	8806000	So let's say you do get an alert from something like you described with Solid Snake.
8806000	8810000	It will just pop up on your phone, vibrate in it, and inform you.
8810000	8817000	Same can also be done with iPhone if they opened up the platform and had support for multiple apps.
8817000	8821000	But Android is a good example of how you can accomplish what you just described.
8821000	8826000	Hmm. Well, it'll be interesting to see if it takes off. I just don't know.
8826000	8829000	Especially with the iPhone dominating everything.
8829000	8835000	If they can pull off Facebook and Twitter and all the other social networking sites on any given mobile platform,
8835000	8845000	even the good ones like Android or Blackberry, then it can be done. It just has to be executed.
8845000	8853000	But social networking is not as much bandwidth as a freaking game running video to your phone, you know?
8853000	8857000	Well, it can be done. You're underestimating the power of cell phones now.
8857000	8858000	Perhaps.
8858000	8865000	Obviously, you would have won the argument several years ago, but the game is different now.
8865000	8877000	It's a different mobile environment. When you have phones that have tens of megabytes of memory to run apps and high-speed connections and bigger screens.
8877000	8881000	I can understand that, and especially Japan has been ahead of the game in that market for a while,
8881000	8885000	but how much of those really penetrated the entire marketplace?
8885000	8893000	The G1 is pretty much a good baseline Android phone that's slated to get 2.0, so it still has some fighting in it.
8893000	8899000	Plus any other Android phone, and obviously the iPhone, the Blackberry, and the Palm Bree.
8899000	8902000	I'm naming these off my head right now.
8902000	8909000	So there's a lot that could be done. It's just a matter of the execution and the design.
8909000	8915000	In other words, it's not impossible, and it shouldn't be ruled out.
8915000	8923000	It just has to be planned to work well within the confines of how it ought to function.
8923000	8927000	Alright, I will see you there. I appreciate the perspective.
8927000	8932000	I won't say it's impossible, but I'll still say probably not anytime soon.
8932000	8942000	Anytime soon is very close right now. When Android comes very close to second place behind the iPhone,
8942000	8950000	you'll have the install base and the wherewithal to execute it, even with Blackberries out there.
8950000	8956000	By the end of this year, I should have won the argument, more or less.
8956000	8960000	We shall see, and if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. It sounds like it'll be a good thing for gaming.
8960000	8962000	If Rob's wrong, he has to wear the tingle costume.
8962000	8964000	Fuck that shit. No way.
8964000	8968000	I mean, right now, you're probably going to get a refresh anyways with a new model,
8968000	8973000	so they may end up selling you a Blackberry or an Android phone or something like that.
8973000	8977000	And those are very powerful. Those are much powerful than your standard run-of-the-mill.
8977000	8981000	Alright. Alright, well, Zachary, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up,
8981000	8983000	but thanks so much for the call, okay? We appreciate the other perspective.
8983000	8984000	Alright, have a good one.
8984000	8985000	Good luck. Later.
8985000	8986000	Bye.
8986000	8989000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. Sorry to those that didn't get through.
8989000	8990000	Something else occurred to me?
8990000	8991000	Yeah, what's up?
8991000	8995000	You know, there are actually regular cell phones that would be powerful enough to do stuff like that in Japan.
8995000	8998000	Well, yeah, but, you know, not anything I'm going to see.
8998000	9006000	But there's been a tendency now for companies to compete with the smartphones by implementing some of the stuff they've got out in the K-tie already, so...
9006000	9011000	I get what he's saying, that it's possible, but unfortunately, you know, I just, I don't,
9011000	9015000	I guess he seems to think it's going to happen a lot sooner than I'm giving it credit for.
9015000	9018000	Maybe the technology's moving a little faster than I'm thinking,
9018000	9025000	but I kind of go, you know, you have to have a lot of people who are going to use it in order to make it effective to build, if that makes sense.
9025000	9026000	That makes sense.
9026000	9027000	That's my little concern.
9027000	9029000	But I get what Zaku's saying.
9029000	9036000	He's saying probably I'm not giving the technical side of it enough appreciation, so, and maybe the way it came off I wasn't, so that's fair enough.
9036000	9039000	Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
9039000	9042000	Once we do last minute stories, I want to skip those.
9042000	9045000	Dark Soccer, Loki, any of you guys have last minute stories tonight?
9045000	9047000	Or do we cover it all?
9047000	9050000	The Mega Man fan movie's going to be coming out soon.
9050000	9055000	This was shown off in a trailer back in November 2008.
9055000	9063000	And apparently it will be coming out, available on the internet soon enough.
9063000	9072000	I'm trying to see when exactly, it's going to be, it's going to be 109 minutes long.
9072000	9082000	And I guess it will be available probably on the website for the film, which is megaman.ninjin.com.
9082000	9084000	That's N-I-N-G-I-N.
9084000	9089000	And they actually have some stuff from that.
9089000	9093000	I guess it was being shown at MAGFest 2010.
9093000	9098000	It was a rough cut that they showed, and that happened actually today.
9098000	9102000	So, um, soon enough I guess.
9102000	9103000	It looks kind of interesting.
9103000	9109000	The guy that had been playing Wily though kind of looks, looks like he needs to wash his face.
9109000	9112000	Are they going to learn anything from the Zelda experience?
9112000	9115000	I'm just saying, like, you know, do you think maybe there's going to be a problem?
9115000	9119000	That Nintendo or Capcom in this case will say,
9119000	9124000	Hey, pull this off the internet, and then it will actually still be on the internet, and nothing will be accomplished.
9124000	9127000	Yep, I'm sure they'll learn a lot from that.
9127000	9130000	Fine.
9130000	9132000	I see your point.
9132000	9136000	Nothing will happen.
9136000	9137000	Is that it?
9137000	9140000	Um, this is kind of interesting.
9140000	9155000	There was a comment, I guess, Gamasutra ran a feature on third-party publisher reactions to the abysmal sales of uninteresting games, or various party games.
9155000	9158000	One of the comments was, one thing for sure, the focus has changed.
9158000	9169000	Stores like Target and Best Buy have reportedly told game publishers not to even bother approaching them with collections of minigames, which they will no longer pick up.
9169000	9172000	Good for them!
9172000	9177000	I think that's a great thing, and you know, honestly, I've been seeing a lot more of that just from my customers.
9177000	9181000	And honestly, I kind of figured that anyways, and I steer them away from that crap.
9181000	9183000	Only good stuff.
9183000	9192000	But sadly enough though, even the good stuff I recommend, like the No More Heroes and that kind of thing, in Madworld, just doesn't do well.
9192000	9197000	That's a bummer, because stupid parents out there want to buy that fucking minigame crap.
9197000	9200000	This is what's wrong with gaming nowadays.
9200000	9202000	The Wii, the Wii is everything that is wrong with gaming.
9202000	9204000	The Wii ruined everything!
9204000	9205000	Exactly.
9205000	9209000	But they still have, you know, there's certain games that come out on the Wii that you have to have.
9209000	9213000	Like, I feel justified owning a Wii, because there is some real good shit that comes out for it.
9213000	9216000	Like New Super Mario Bros. Wii was fantastic.
9216000	9219000	Crazy stuff.
9219000	9223000	Hey, one of our chatters is calling us in on a last minute story, and actually this is something I do remember reading.
9223000	9225000	I just neglected to put it on the show the night.
9225000	9228000	But Jay Dizzle in our chatroom at chat.orangessontraday.com is saying,
9228000	9231000	Crayon physics is on sale till the 15th.
9231000	9232000	You can pay as much as you want.
9232000	9235000	It's doing that whole thing where you can pay what you feel the game is worth.
9235000	9237000	You got some people paying a penny for it.
9237000	9240000	Maybe they're hoping some people will pay $150.
9240000	9243000	You know, like happened, I think, when World of Goo did that.
9243000	9248000	So, you know, I would say maybe like $5, $10, whatever you believe is appropriate.
9248000	9252000	Or maybe I'll probably go buy it and pay $6.66.
9252000	9254000	I think that would be fun.
9254000	9256000	Or $6.90.
9256000	9260000	No, you should pay $4.20.
9260000	9262000	$5.37.
9262000	9264000	Anything? Oh, $5.30.
9264000	9265000	$5.73.
9265000	9267000	Let's see what you did there.
9267000	9268000	Nice.
9268000	9270000	Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?
9270000	9271000	That's it.
9271000	9272000	All right.
9272000	9273000	That's going to do it.
9273000	9277000	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap it up tonight.
9277000	9279000	So, Dark Soccer, what's your final thought tonight?
9279000	9283000	I finally learned to knit a scarf without messing up my rows.
9283000	9284000	Congrats.
9284000	9286000	See, it doesn't look nice.
9286000	9290000	My final thought is LA tomorrow, Seattle Friday.
9290000	9292000	I've got a busy week ahead.
9292000	9293000	Loki, your final thought?
9293000	9297000	My final thought is I wish people would stop quitting out of my games on Grand Theft Auto.
9297000	9302000	And, you know, I don't know what I've got to do.
9302000	9303000	I'm even nice.
9303000	9309000	Usually when I'm like $1,000 ahead, I'll just fuck around so that, you know, at least I'm not, like, pissing people off.
9309000	9312000	Although there was at one time that I was trying to get a high streak.
9312000	9314000	I got a 17 streak.
9314000	9317000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9317000	9320000	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and downloading our show and supporting it.
9320000	9323000	Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

9338000	9344000	So, please, if you have a little time today, make a top 25 list of your favorite games of all time.
9344000	9346000	No criteria, but what is your favorite?
9346000	9354000	And email them to uslmadness, that's u-s-l-m-a-d-n-e-s-s at gmail.com and help our buddies out over at Understation Live.
9354000	9357000	Remember a programming note, there is no show next week.
9357000	9360000	Podcast listeners, you will see a new show in two weeks.
9360000	9369000	And for those of you that do listen live, it will be 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, which means 6 o'clock London and Greenwich.
9369000	9372000	So, you overseas folks are hopefully in for a treat.
9372000	9375000	I want lots of accents next week on the Skype line.
9375000	9376000	One more plot though, remember.
9376000	9377000	Yeah, yes, please.
9377000	9389000	Tara and I are doing, or Maron Marvel and I are doing a podcast, although we may or may not have one this week, for Monday Comics Mania, which you can see at AvengersTowerAllInWord.com.
9389000	9391000	Oh my god, comics.
9391000	9394000	Yeah, you get to hear Rob's cameo.
9394000	9395000	Very nice.
9395000	9399000	When do I get to come be a guest on the show and I'll talk about, I don't know, I'll go, I'll read, you know what I will do?
9399000	9403000	One week I will read a comic, just so I can actually be on your show.
9403000	9405000	Get to my house early.
9405000	9406000	Alright, fair enough.
9406000	9411000	Alright, that's it guys. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting us. We really appreciate it.
