0	19920	Today, January 31st, 2010, big Nintendo franchise games could be out this year, the classic
19920	29760	Japanese release looks to be US-bound, and Ubisoft announces a controversial new DRM.
29760	38080	We are live, I think, and welcome to another week everybody of Orange Lounge Radio, we
38080	43980	are that show dedicated to video gaming, video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43980	48480	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week, and also joining me tonight, say hello
48480	52640	to the one and only Happiest Bunny on the Farm, or as we used to call her anyway, the
52640	56320	one and only, now she's an angry bunny, no I don't know, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
56320	57320	I'm not angry.
57320	59200	No, she's a very pleasant bunny, contrary to her.
59200	60200	I'm not a bunny.
60200	61200	To rumors.
61200	63600	I'm not a bunny.
63600	64600	You're some bunny.
64600	65600	Meow.
65600	66600	Meow.
66600	69600	Alright, so, and also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
69600	70600	Hello.
70600	71600	Hi, how you doing?
71600	72600	Doing fine.
72600	74920	He proved he was the Techmaster tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
74920	76520	Okay, where the hell did we start?
76520	80000	Alright, obviously we've been without a show for two weeks, and that's not the place
80000	81480	we like to be.
81480	85400	You guys knew this was coming though, because a couple weeks ago we told you guys that there
85400	89080	was not gonna be an Orange Lounge Radio because I was gonna be in Seattle, but then the plan
89080	91480	was that the week after that we were gonna do the early show.
91480	98200	We were gonna do the 10 a.m. show Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. for the UK listeners.
98200	101760	We were gonna do a show for them, and that was gonna be the special early show.
101760	106040	Well, unfortunately, we came here, we got up at the ass crack of dawn to come here,
106040	109680	do the show, and unfortunately when we booted the studio computer, it started to launch
109680	111680	Windows XP, and then died.
111680	113160	Terrible, terrible.
113160	117000	So unfortunately, we didn't end up having a show last week, and that kills.
117000	121920	We really hate missing two weeks in a row, because we know a lot of people, you know,
121920	125800	well especially the fact that we know a lot of our British listeners were, you know, making
125800	128680	plans to tune in, so we feel really bad that that didn't happen.
128680	131600	But of course, you know, computer issues are computer issues, there's not a lot we can
131600	135120	do about it, so it didn't happen.
135120	138080	So we had to replace the old computer essentially.
138080	142860	Now the nice thing is we already had a new computer waiting for us, because you might
142860	146800	remember a couple years ago, or you might not, the listeners all pooled together and
146800	147800	bought us a new computer.
147800	148800	Wasn't that long ago?
148800	149800	Was it?
149800	150800	Well, maybe it was about a year ago.
150800	153800	Well, it was just a great gesture, because we didn't ask for it, it was just a really
153800	156540	nice thing, and we thought, oh, now that we have this extra computer, we're going to use
156540	160280	it for some video projects that never got off the ground because of all our studio moves
160280	162160	and we're actually in a smaller space now.
162160	164480	But anyway, it ended up being a really good thing we had that on hand.
164480	169840	But Loki took that computer, got all the software on it this week, and literally within an hour,
169840	174960	got our old studio drive in the new computer, we got it all up and running.
174960	178520	I'm going to take some credit too, because I got the Skype working and some of the internal
178520	183000	Adobe Audition was pissing me off, because we upgraded to a newer version of that too.
183000	185280	Now here's the other thing.
185280	190280	We have folks in chat tonight, chat.orangelaunchrader.com, welcome to all you guys in chat, saying, wow,
190280	192980	you guys sound clear tonight, you guys sound better than usual.
192980	194320	Here's the other thing.
194320	201680	We were also working on a top secret upgrade this whole time, a brand new mixing board
201680	204640	that we just posted a picture of to our Twitter account.
204640	205640	And the website.
205640	208520	Oh, did you send it to the website too?
208520	209520	Yes.
209520	210520	Nice.
210520	211520	So it's also there on orangelaunchrader.com.
211520	214100	So if we do sound a little different, you can thank our new mixing board.
214100	218380	And supposedly our mixing board does all these effects I haven't even played with yet.
218380	221880	Like I think it does like equalizer effects.
221880	225320	Like I think if I hit that button, I think my voice gets more bassy.
225320	228260	I don't know if anyone notices that, but there's like an onboard equalizer.
228260	230040	We just opened this out of the box tonight.
230040	231040	Let me turn that off.
231040	233140	I don't even know if that did anything at all.
233140	236200	But I think supposedly you can do these weird FX things too.
236200	239360	Like if I turn, let's see which ones me turn that up.
239360	240480	This is all live radio.
240480	241480	It's all the fun.
241480	246100	I think if I turn that up, it actually does some type of delay effect.
246100	247100	It probably sounds stupid.
247100	248100	I don't know.
248100	249100	Let me turn that down.
249100	253560	So anyway, we're going to play with the new mixing board and see what happens with that
253560	254860	over the next few weeks.
254860	257400	I don't even know if it, maybe nothing happened at all.
257400	259880	We're still kind of playing with this thing, but it's fancy.
259880	260960	I like it.
260960	262920	It's very bright when it's on.
262920	263920	It's very cool.
263920	266480	I feel like we're moving on up, moving on up, moving on up.
266480	267480	All right.
267480	268480	So anyway, it's great to be back.
268480	271440	We're really sorry we missed the past couple of weeks, but I think for some of these upgrades
271440	274080	that we've had here in studio, in a way it was almost worth it.
274080	277800	I can tell you the show computer is much better than it was before.
277800	279360	So I'm excited.
279360	281520	And they said in chat they didn't hear the FX.
281520	282640	So, all right.
282640	284280	So I'll have to play with the mixing board over there.
284280	285280	I don't know.
285280	286440	I was just kind of futzing around with it.
286440	288080	I don't know what effect is on.
288080	289800	I'm not, I'm not going to worry about it.
289800	291100	Those effects seem kind of stupid.
291100	293960	Like that effect was supposed to be delay.
293960	297000	So it would probably just make, make, make, make, me, me, me, me.
297000	298000	Sound, sound, sound, sound.
298000	299000	Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
299000	300000	So yeah.
300000	301000	Anyway.
301000	302000	All right.
302000	303000	Yes.
303000	304320	And D5T in our chat room says it goes to 11.
304320	305320	Yes.
305320	306920	Our new mixing board, actually it goes past 11.
306920	310020	It goes to plus 60.
310020	311440	This guy goes to 60.
311440	312520	All right.
312520	314560	Lots of gaming news we've missed in the meantime.
314560	315600	Let's get to it.
315600	316940	It has been some time.
316940	319560	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
319560	322920	Um, I didn't.
322920	323920	Not really.
323920	326600	I mean, I played Star Trek online, but I missed the end of the beta because I wanted to see
326600	329800	all of the Borg going in and assimilating all the people in game.
329800	336640	Um, I did see the video of it and it was pretty funny and, um, because like, uh, the Borg
336640	339680	took over, uh, Earth or the star base outside of Earth.
339680	340680	So it was pretty fun.
340680	346400	Um, I got, um, Tatunoko versus Capcom because I decided I did not want Silent Hill Shattered
346400	347400	Memories.
347400	351680	Um, I know me not wanting a Silent Hill, but it wasn't really a Silent Hill.
351680	354080	I don't think it was like a different kind of game.
354080	359320	So I have Tatunoko versus Capcom, which makes me a happy fangirl.
359320	364680	And um, I, I read this really about it.
364680	370160	I think Dan's been playing a crap ton of Borderlands as usual.
370160	375640	And I finished another season of DS9 and it has nothing to do with playing games.
375640	377160	Oh no, no, no, no, no.
377160	378160	We did something.
378160	382880	We broke out the SNES and got our Super Metroid on.
382880	383880	I love Super Metroid.
383880	386880	By the way, guys, I just want to say in chat, cause some chatters are complaining about
386880	387880	Jamie's voice.
387880	388880	Hey!
388880	389880	No, not in that way.
389880	393760	Just that it's a little loud, but the nice thing is this mixing board does, I can adjust
393760	397360	audio on the fly way easier without screwing with gain, which is what I had to do before,
397360	400200	which would, that's why you got like the keyboard noises and everything.
400200	403920	Also Jamie is on a brand new mic, so I'm adjusting her a little bit here on the fly.
403920	404920	Live radio.
404920	405920	I love it.
405920	409100	I have a brand spanking new mic and my mic has a case.
409100	410100	It's beautiful.
410100	411720	So hopefully Jamie's volume is a little better now.
411720	412720	Just let me know.
412720	416680	We'll, we'll play with things tonight as we go and I apologize cause it's completely unprofessional,
416680	418240	but you know what?
418240	419240	I don't care.
419240	420240	You know what?
420240	421240	I don't care.
421240	422240	You know what?
422240	423240	You know what?
423240	424240	You know what?
424240	425240	There, that's what I say.
425240	426240	That's it.
426240	429000	Loki, how was your gaming week or three weeks as it will?
429000	430520	Well, it's all been about the same.
430520	435240	So um, I've been playing, you know, a lot of Grand Theft Auto, even at home now been
435240	439840	just trying to play more ranked matches to move up the leaderboards because I'm around
439840	441480	like 240 now.
441480	447480	Um, just that's out of um, ranked death matches and total money overall.
447480	451840	So um, that's alright, but I keep moving down because, you know, especially like this weekend
451840	456720	I didn't play any at all, but um, I'm doing pretty good and then my true skill ranking
456720	460080	as far as uh, ranked death match goes, I'm almost in the top 100.
460080	462320	Might be in the top 100 right now, I don't know.
462320	465700	But uh, last I checked I was like 104, 105.
465700	469760	So um, that's pretty good out of like 50,000 people.
469760	476040	Um, and then I've been playing Borderlands a lot, especially since I can, you know, mod
476040	477040	weapons on it.
477040	481080	So I've been playing with mod weapons and that's actually been pretty fun.
481080	485720	I've been trying not to make myself too overpowered, but um, I don't know.
485720	486720	It's been pretty cool.
486720	489280	Lots of crazy weapons you can make in the game.
489280	494560	Just really looking forward to uh, finishing it and then definitely getting all the download
494560	495560	content.
495560	499120	Um, and then, you know, we're going to be talking about a third piece of download content
499120	500200	probably later in the show.
500200	502880	So it's very exciting.
502880	509320	And then um, yeah, and then as I was going to say, uh, I know everybody's been bugging
509320	513080	me about doing more like videos for the YouTube channel.
513080	517700	So I finally, I put the one video that I did a while back on the YouTube channel, so there's
517700	522680	something there now and there's a new one, which I already previewed in studio, um, at
522680	523760	least the first three minutes of it.
523760	526080	I want to make it like 10 minutes, but it's pretty funny.
526080	529420	A lot of these custom things that Loki always talks about on the show, you can now kind
529420	530420	of see on the YouTube.
530420	531420	It's great.
531420	536740	It's, it will document, um, you know, how I used to play death match in, um, Grand Theft
536740	541320	Auto, um, the lost and damned while back when we played with modded consoles and modded
541320	546980	games and whatnot, um, are closed, you know, work games that we'd play.
546980	551660	But um, you know, it's hard to explain it, so I just kind of have to show you.
551660	556040	So the first part of the video that I have done that I finished this weekend, um, is
556040	560600	basically showing the different weapons in the game and then the very end there's like
560600	562520	some of the vehicles that you can use in there.
562520	567380	And then finally, I'm going to get into the actual death match stuff because I have like
567380	571460	hours of footage that I have to go through and edit down and stuff.
571460	575560	But um, I do have enough right now to kind of upload to YouTube if I wanted to.
575560	576960	I just don't know if I'm going to.
576960	577960	I may want to get home.
577960	578960	We'll see.
578960	583160	But um, it's, it's going to be awesome.
583160	584160	All right.
584160	585840	I'm looking forward to seeing more of the YouTube.
585840	587920	I didn't realize you'd already put one up.
587920	588920	Yes.
588920	589920	I did that yesterday.
589920	590920	Awesome.
590920	591920	Uh, let's see.
591920	593880	My gaming week, actually, I got to say it's, it's been pretty standard.
593880	597160	I've been sucked into pretty much one game and that's World of Warcraft.
597160	600280	My paladin, I'm going to do nerd speak for a minute here.
600280	605000	My paladin hit level 80 at the end of December and now I finally cleared every five man dungeon
605000	609040	as of this past week, including Halls of Reflection, which was, um, wow.
609040	610040	That was a toughie.
610040	614540	Uh, it was definitely a gear check of sorts, but I've been trying to just slowly upgrade
614540	619040	my gear, trying to get some of the Emblem of Triumph rewards.
619040	622620	And I even got a cape from my Emblem of Frost rewards, which is great because I don't really
622620	625940	raid on this character because I found raiding was too much of a time investment.
625940	629960	But I did run Naxxramas for the hell of it this week, just a little bit with a pickup
629960	630960	guild.
630960	631960	So it was kind of fun.
631960	633560	So anyway, that's pretty much that.
633560	636080	And, uh, Brad from Pop Culture and Chats asks, uh, what?
636080	637080	No Star Trek Online?
637080	639400	No, my computer will not run Star Trek Online.
639400	641400	My video card is not good enough.
641400	645360	When I try to run, at least when I was in the beta, uh, when I try to run the beta,
645360	650760	I get the music comes up and everything, but no, no visuals on the screen, which is usually
650760	652920	a sign that your video card sucks.
652920	653920	Here's the thing.
653920	658280	I bought my computer about a year and a half ago at this point for about $800.
658280	661680	I made the mistake of buying a box computer because I thought, Ooh, good deal.
661680	662680	This is great.
662680	663680	I sold it.
663680	664680	It's like a gaming computer.
664680	665680	Okay.
665680	666680	Here's the thing.
666680	669480	The video card port is AGP, not PCI express.
669480	671400	So that's really old.
671400	672400	Exactly.
672400	675560	I was pissed when I found that out, but stupid me, my mistake.
675560	676560	Lesson learned.
676560	677560	Just so you know.
677560	682080	I got my computer the Christmas 2009 and I can run it.
682080	683080	Yeah.
683080	686620	Mine, well, mine's from about 2008 cause I think I bought it around August of 08.
686620	689720	So you know, it's just a bummer, but lesson learned for next time.
689720	693520	So I might have to get a new computer later on down the line.
693520	695280	My gaming really didn't end there though.
695280	702460	I didn't really play, but I watched God of War collection this weekend, which included
702460	704360	the God of War 3 demo.
704360	705560	God of War is kind of one of those games.
705560	706560	It's really weird.
706560	711160	I haven't played a lot of it myself, but I've watched several other people play this game,
711160	717000	but I got to see the kind of new, like upgraded graphics for God of War 1.
717000	718440	I have to admit the game looked pretty good.
718440	722120	I mean, it definitely, you definitely can tell the improvements over a PlayStation 2
722120	723120	game.
723120	727480	The only like, and this is so minor, some of the overlays were kind of stretched to
727480	731960	be widescreen as opposed to like redone, but honestly that bitch is so minor.
731960	734480	I think the game really looks great and it's kind of one of those games I'm always sitting
734480	738320	there going, hmm, I want to, I want to kind of pick this up and play it, but for now I'll
738320	742480	just watch my boyfriend play cause he's having a lot of fun playing it, which by the way,
742480	743760	can I just say this real quick?
743760	749460	Why I'm really mad the show last week didn't happen is that he was supposed, he was a surprise
749460	751440	special guest on the show last week.
751440	755160	He's really funny and knows his shit when it comes to games, so I'm really disappointed
755160	758000	it didn't work out, but we're going to try to get him on a later show cause I'm sure
758000	761960	you guys are going to enjoy it.
761960	766540	Let's see, what else have I been playing these past few weeks that is not WoW related?
766540	771020	Still some Xbox live arcade things, one versus a hundred, cause I think the season's wrapping
771020	772020	up pretty soon.
772020	776200	A little bit of Gyromancer, a little bit, and a Bejeweled Blitz, you know Bejeweled
776200	778880	Blitz just got a major update, update on Facebook.
778880	782480	Now you collect coins to buy power ups that you use.
782480	786680	I love PopCap, they make the best, they make the best crack games in the world.
786680	787680	It's great.
787680	790880	Anyhow, uh, feel free to join our chat room guys if you're listening live.
790880	796360	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after
796360	797860	the Bobby Black Wolf show.
797860	800800	We start at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
800800	804120	We got a little bit of a late start tonight because of all the issues going on with our
804120	805120	audio board.
805120	808680	In fact, I may have already said this whole spiel about All Games Radio and if I did I
808680	813600	apologize cause I'm really scatterbrained tonight with all the stuff going on.
813600	818320	But now we can kind of coast into housekeeping and tonight's news, I do want to say real
818320	823700	quick during housekeeping, again, there was no show on the feed for the past two weeks.
823700	829640	There was nothing so this should be the first show that shows up, episode 353 after 352
829640	830640	which was taped.
830640	832520	Believe it or not, on the 10th of the month.
832520	835940	So we have missed you guys as I know a lot of you have missed us.
835940	838840	And of course we have some fancy new toys and we're going to be playing with these over
838840	839840	the next few weeks.
839840	845040	Um, do bear with us though during tonight's show when we have a whole new setup, uh, we're
845040	847380	more prone to technical difficulties.
847380	851640	So just give a shout out and chat if suddenly our audio drops or something really weird
851640	852640	happens.
852640	853640	You don't hear us dead air.
853640	856960	Uh, our live listeners, we really count on you guys to help us out.
856960	860760	That dot orange lounge radio.com.
860760	864360	Also since I have been so focused on trying to make sure the show is starting by six o'clock,
864360	867960	I haven't been posting a lot of tweets, but go ahead and send in your Twitter topics.
867960	871320	If you have some stuff you want us to discuss tonight, we'll be taking those at the top
871320	872960	of part B tonight.
872960	877280	And of course, if you don't yet have us on Twitter, it's twitter.com slash O L R or we're
877280	879440	on Facebook too at orange lounge radio.
879440	884320	And as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, finally showing the YouTube some love and that's YouTube
884320	888640	orange lounge or orange, orange, orange, orange radio.
888640	892040	Usually if we're on a website, we're either under orange lounge or orange lounge radio.
892040	895160	So one of the two, anyhow, how about some news?
895160	897200	How about some actual video gaming news for the past week?
897200	899040	Look, you want to start us off tonight?
899040	900040	Yes.
900040	904760	Um, there is a report from Nintendo that hints at some of the titles coming soon as well
904760	911960	as possibly a released window for Metroid other M. Um, it's interesting.
911960	917760	They kind of, uh, and this is of course Japanese release dates, but, uh, there's some pretty
917760	923280	generic, um, you know, dates in fact, some that are just to be announced, uh, for example,
923280	930320	Metroid other M is slated right now for summer 2010, which is pretty awesome, you know?
930320	936360	Um, and then of course, uh, there's a title Xenoblade, which is, um, scheduled to be coming
936360	942920	out, uh, spring of 2010, so probably right around the corner.
942920	949800	And um, apparently I think, uh, Xenoblade is a new, uh, RPG, I want to say, um, and
949800	955040	then they've got Super Mario Galaxy, which is, you know, due sometime 2010, most likely
955040	958400	probably around the holiday, uh, be my guess.
958400	964760	And then, um, some other stuff I haven't heard of, uh, there's a new Legend of Zelda that's
964760	968280	uh, to be announced, Lion Attack Heroes, which is something that they showed, you know, during
968280	976720	E3, um, uh, Hoshi no Kirby, Kirby game, um, that's also to be announced and start with
976720	980600	a hundred words English conversation, most likely a game we probably won't see over here
980600	985040	because most of us speak English, maybe not that well, but we do speak it.
985040	990520	Um, and then Span, um, Smasher is another, uh, Wii game, which I remember, I think that
990520	993200	was a WiiWare title, um, I can't remember.
993200	998560	And then, um, looks like, uh, Kensaku-su, also another to be announced title.
998560	1004800	And then Last Story, uh, which is I believe the new Mistwalker title, um, all those have
1004800	1009280	been announced for, you know, sometime this year or to be announced.
1009280	1015080	And then, uh, also there's a promo video that says, um, the new Zelda game, the one that
1015080	1018640	is kind of, uh, to be announced may be coming this year.
1018640	1024880	In fact, um, apparently, uh, something that they're thinking is going to be shown off
1024880	1025880	at E3.
1025880	1031560	And my guess is probably yes, because they're going to need something to get people's attention
1031560	1038720	after they show Wii Relax, because everybody's going to be like, ugh, don't care.
1038720	1042040	Do you think, I kind of get the impression based on a lot of this, what you're saying,
1042040	1046920	that Nintendo is really trying this year to really wow us at E3 where there's been a lot
1046920	1049040	of disappointment in years past.
1049040	1051200	Not just these games we've talked about so far, but some other ones we're going to talk
1051200	1052200	about in a minute.
1052200	1055640	It seems like there's a lot of core franchise news coming out of Nintendo.
1055640	1059200	Like they're really, with the exception of, well no, even Mario is supposed to have Galaxy
1059200	1060200	2, right?
1060200	1061200	So you've got what?
1061200	1066720	You've got Galaxy 2, Zelda, Metroid, I mean, a lot of their big franchises have games this
1066720	1067720	year.
1067720	1068720	Well, so far.
1068720	1069720	I mean, dates change.
1069720	1072560	We're talking about the end of 2010 now.
1072560	1076240	I mean, this stuff could all be pushed, you know, by the time we get to it.
1076240	1079880	Is it possible, though, that Nintendo's been working on the Zelda game in secret, quote
1079880	1080880	unquote?
1080880	1084680	I mean, you know, saying there's a new Zelda game is about as obvious as, you know, it
1084680	1086720	might rain today, you know?
1086720	1090680	But here's, remember E3 last year?
1090680	1095000	The Mario game came out of nowhere, and it ended up probably being the best Wii game
1095000	1096000	of the year.
1096000	1100200	I don't doubt that they're working on a new Zelda game, and the thing is, though, is I
1100200	1104520	wouldn't expect it to probably be too different than Twilight Princess was, because look at
1104520	1108520	Mario Galaxy, I mean, all they're really doing is crafting new levels to go with it.
1108520	1112800	It's basically going to be the same engine all over again, I mean, no effort there.
1112800	1116240	Wasn't there a rumor, and I want to say it was on our show roll for last week, because
1116240	1119400	sadly, the show didn't happen, but we had a whole script and a whole thing ready to
1119400	1123160	go, and I want to say one of the things was about that supposedly the new Zelda's supposed
1123160	1124520	to be kind of like Majora's Mask.
1124520	1127360	It was supposed to be a sequel to Majora's Mask, but, uh...
1127360	1131880	Which would make sense, because Majora's Mask was essentially, you know, Ocarina of Time
1131880	1134920	with some new frills, you know, because it was a new game.
1134920	1136180	I just...
1136180	1137180	I don't know.
1137180	1138180	I'm...
1138180	1141800	A lot of the stuff they see from Nintendo, and granted, other M looks pretty awesome,
1141800	1146120	but that's being kind of developed by a third party anyways, so whatever.
1146120	1150320	I just want to see Samus' booby mechanics, because it is Team Ninja after all.
1150320	1152000	So you know she's going to have some booby mechanics.
1152000	1153000	It's going to be awesome.
1153000	1155840	Even though she wears like a steel space suit or something.
1155840	1160040	I still want to see, I would rather see a lot of third party companies work with Nintendo
1160040	1164680	on some new games, you know, if that's what it's going to take to make these games kind
1164680	1166720	of stand out and be a little different.
1166720	1168800	I think that would be pretty cool.
1168800	1173840	Can you imagine like a new Mario game with, you know, them working with like Sonic Team
1173840	1174840	or something like that?
1174840	1178280	You know, like the 3D...
1178280	1180640	Suddenly Mario is blue and has spiky hair.
1180640	1181640	It's incredible.
1181640	1185560	Well it doesn't have to be exactly Sonic, but I'm just saying something like, you know,
1185560	1186720	the Sonic Adventure stuff.
1186720	1187720	I mean, just...
1187720	1188720	I don't know.
1188720	1192880	Or maybe revivals of some of the dead franchises that people really want to see come back.
1192880	1195720	Like, oh I don't know, Kid Icarus maybe?
1195720	1197000	Just a hunch?
1197000	1198000	We need Pit.
1198000	1199000	Exactly.
1199000	1200000	Whatever happened to that rumor?
1200000	1203440	There was artwork and all this shit that came out for the game?
1203440	1204440	And then it just...
1204440	1205440	No.
1205440	1206440	What?
1206440	1207680	The studio that was developing it closed, right?
1207680	1208680	It was Factor 5, right?
1208680	1209880	And they're not around?
1209880	1210880	I don't know.
1210880	1212520	This is all based on rumor.
1212520	1215640	That's why I say this with a question mark, because I'm sure it was rumored that like
1215640	1217240	five different people were developing it.
1217240	1218240	So...
1218240	1219240	Ugh.
1219240	1220240	Um, so yeah.
1220240	1221240	I mean, it'll...
1221240	1222240	I don't know.
1222240	1227080	I'm just not expecting a lot from it, but people I'm sure will love it, because Twilight
1227080	1229080	Princess was alright.
1229080	1233000	I just didn't really get into it, but maybe I'll try it again later on.
1233000	1235440	I don't know.
1235440	1239400	I like Wind Waker, so I must have something wrong with me.
1239400	1240400	Yeah you do.
1240400	1241400	No, I'm just kidding.
1241400	1242400	Well I have something...
1242400	1246040	No, clearly I have something wrong with me, because I think Ocarina of Time is so overrated.
1246040	1247040	Like it is not...
1247040	1248040	No, no.
1248040	1249040	I don't care for the Zelda game by far.
1249040	1250880	I don't care for the Nintendo 64 or Zelda games at all.
1250880	1257480	I hated the jump to 3D, just because I loved Link to the Past so much, like that that was
1257480	1260440	the next Zelda game just made me want to barf.
1260440	1261440	And I've tried.
1261440	1262440	Guys, I've tried.
1262440	1263440	And honestly...
1263440	1264440	I loved Ocarina.
1264440	1265440	I know.
1265440	1266440	Most people do.
1266440	1267440	I admit I'm weird.
1267440	1271040	I also think most people give too much fan wank to Chrono Trigger.
1271040	1273760	I don't think Chrono Trigger is that great.
1273760	1274760	Like it's great.
1274760	1276640	How much of it did you play?
1276640	1277640	Almost beat it.
1277640	1278640	I think I recorded it the way I thought.
1278640	1281080	Why don't they just take a page from Capcom?
1281080	1282080	And I've seen the ending.
1282080	1287280	I mean, we've seen how Capcom can sell these retro games that look like they were on the
1287280	1289000	NES or something.
1289000	1293700	Just make another Link to the Past or something like that.
1293700	1298240	You don't have to go all 3D and all crazy...
1298240	1301960	That's what they do on the Game Boy Advance, at least it was a couple years ago.
1301960	1305280	All those Game Boy Advance games were kind of like Link to the Past-y kind of games.
1305280	1308320	But I didn't like them because they were on the freaking Game Boy Advance and I wanted
1308320	1309600	something on my TV.
1309600	1313220	Although, you know, get one of the GameCube adapters.
1313220	1314220	Not the same thing.
1314220	1315220	And you know it.
1315220	1319560	I'm surprised we don't see Game Boy Advance games on the Wii yet.
1319560	1320560	Like virtual consoles?
1320560	1321560	Soon.
1321560	1322560	Soon.
1322560	1326440	Well, speaking of virtual console, you know, if these new games don't sound like your thing,
1326440	1328440	maybe some old classics.
1328440	1331320	And you want to talk classic, here's a game.
1331320	1335040	If you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, besides this is your first show,
1335040	1339120	you've heard this game come up on the show before because it is one of Jamie's all-time
1339120	1342440	favorites and she always says, Rob, you need to play this game.
1342440	1345800	I'm gonna have to get out, you know, my old system so you can play this game.
1345800	1347200	Well, she may not have to.
1347200	1354000	Castlevania Rondo of Blood apparently has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii.
1354000	1358280	Now this is following a couple weeks of reports that it was rated by the Australian board,
1358280	1360360	it was rated by, you know, other boards.
1360360	1366520	Apparently now it has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, which indicates that it will
1366520	1369040	be headed to the Wii.
1369040	1374720	So and by the way, you had to have a PC Engine CD device a long time ago in order to play
1374720	1375720	this game.
1375720	1379560	Or you played the PSP remake, but of course that wouldn't be the original.
1379560	1386320	But that, what was it, Akumajo Collection or whatever it was called had this and Symphony
1386320	1387320	of the Night.
1387320	1388840	But this game had been quite altered.
1388840	1392160	So now apparently it is headed for the Wii.
1392160	1396400	What is also interesting about this, not only has this kind of been confirmed thanks to
1396400	1403680	the ESRB, but also a representative from Hudson has said the game is coming out shortly, but
1403680	1405200	here's the other interesting thing.
1405200	1406800	Not in English.
1406800	1410480	Because it is a virtual console release, it's just an emulation of the old game, they did
1410480	1413240	not go back and touch up any of the language.
1413240	1416880	So it's just, it is exactly what it was back in the day.
1416880	1425640	The only parts of this game that are in Japanese is, well even the freaking intro is in German,
1425640	1431060	and then there's dialogue that's like right at the beginning of the game, right when you
1431060	1436560	rescue people, and when you fight Dracula.
1436560	1442480	And really it's like, oh, Richter, it's your wife, blah blah blah, oh Maria, blah blah
1442480	1443480	blah.
1443480	1444480	You know, whatever.
1444480	1448040	I've played the intro though for you, haven't I?
1448040	1449040	I think so.
1449040	1450040	I think like a long time ago on the show.
1450040	1453480	With the beginning of it's like in like Gothic German.
1453480	1456680	There's actually, there's YouTubes of it now, but yeah.
1456680	1458680	But what do you think, Dark Sakura?
1458680	1463440	Now this is a game that went for a lot of money and still probably does go for a lot
1463440	1464440	of money.
1464440	1468520	Like I remember you saying something about a friend owed you like a hundred dollars and
1468520	1472000	came back from Japan with that to pay us back, and that was like a way better, you got a
1472000	1475680	better end of the deal, essentially, because that game's worth like what, two hundred or
1475680	1476680	something?
1476680	1483920	Well, the last eBay auction I looked at for that game intact was ending I think at about
1483920	1486280	a hundred and fifty for a low one.
1486280	1487280	Okay.
1487280	1488280	What do you think about this now?
1488280	1492600	Do you think that this could possibly devalue that purchase, or is this a good thing because
1492600	1495820	more people will get to play the game without having to have all this fancy stuff?
1495820	1498680	To be honest, I don't really give a crap about the value of the game.
1498680	1500400	I mean, because it's a fun game.
1500400	1501920	I would love for people to play it.
1501920	1502920	Well good.
1502920	1503920	Then you're collecting for the right reasons.
1503920	1506720	I think it's great that I have a real copy of it.
1506720	1510760	I liked my burn copy for, yes, I had a burn copy.
1510760	1516880	I'm glad that I had it because I played the crap out of it and, and keep in mind for the
1516880	1519360	longest time, that was the only way I could remotely play it.
1519360	1523680	So I'm sure there's going to be, you know, other formerly frustrated fangirls.
1523680	1527040	Ooh, that's actually a good name for a podcast.
1527040	1529000	Formerly frustrated fangirls.
1529000	1531400	Isn't that what you and TRS comic book show is?
1531400	1534120	Yeah, that's Monday Comic Mania.
1534120	1535120	Oh, I see.
1535120	1536120	Are you guys on iTunes yet?
1536120	1537120	No.
1537120	1538120	Oh.
1538120	1539120	We were going to talk to you about that.
1539120	1540120	Okay.
1540120	1541120	All right.
1541120	1542120	Call me.
1542120	1543120	Have your people call my people.
1543120	1544120	Anyway.
1544120	1545120	My people being me.
1545120	1546120	Rondo of Blood.
1546120	1547120	Sure me.
1547120	1548120	Call Rob.
1548120	1551800	Which is what will happen if your show doesn't get listed on iTunes, Rondo of Blood.
1551800	1554880	Anything else we should know about this game being on virtual console?
1554880	1555880	It's fucking fun.
1555880	1557880	I wonder how much they're going to charge us for it.
1557880	1560680	What are they charging for the other?
1560680	1566560	If Neo Geo games are like 9, I think Turbo Graf, well you can't say Turbo Graf is a CD.
1566560	1568960	It's a PC Engine CD, this one.
1568960	1573440	I'm going to guess, with no real basis, they're going to charge 10 bucks.
1573440	1577000	Well what are they already charging for the CD games elsewhere?
1577000	1578280	I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.
1578280	1580680	I don't even know if PC Engine CD has been emulated yet.
1580680	1581680	I thought they did.
1581680	1582680	Have they?
1582680	1583680	They did.
1583680	1584680	East, didn't they?
1584680	1585680	Or Vallis?
1585680	1586680	They've done some.
1586680	1587680	Yeah, they've done some of the CD games.
1587680	1588680	A few of them have.
1588680	1591960	There's so much on virtual console now I can't even keep track of it anymore.
1591960	1595160	But yeah, I want a lot of people to get it.
1595160	1600280	I would actually love to see people spend the money on this so that Nintendo knows that
1600280	1602560	hey, we want more.
1602560	1609540	You know, especially this game, keep in mind, for a long time this game was considered one
1609540	1613920	of those pinnacles of gaming that you just could not find here.
1613920	1618280	You had to be something special to have it or have good contacts or have money.
1618280	1619760	You know.
1619760	1625400	And I think that it just goes to show that, you know, maybe patience is a virtue.
1625400	1626720	A virtual virtue.
1626720	1627720	Aww.
1627720	1628720	Aww.
1628720	1631400	And by the way, the next game they need to put out is Sapphire.
1631400	1632720	Some comments from our chat room.
1632720	1636640	Ray Ayanami says, thank you for not being the snobby her-her, I bought the original
1636640	1640320	for $9001 kind of collector Dark Sakura.
1640320	1642320	There you go.
1642320	1645600	Well, you know what, there's actually two other games though that I would love to see
1645600	1649000	coming on a virtual console, but one of them they would have to translate.
1649000	1650000	And what's that?
1650000	1652640	It's an RPG called Emerald Dragon.
1652640	1658720	Well, I don't see that really happening because have you seen any game on virtual console
1658720	1661520	kind of go back and be tinkered with at all?
1661520	1666720	I can only think of Pokemon Snap because it saves pictures to your thing or your Wii board
1666720	1667720	or whatever it's called.
1667720	1668720	But Sapphire.
1668720	1669720	Sapphire needs to come out.
1669720	1671520	I don't think they've translated a single game yet.
1671520	1675040	Sapphire's a shooter.
1675040	1677720	And I think I might have done Sapphire as a classic game.
1677720	1678720	I might have.
1678720	1679720	I'll have to check.
1679720	1688360	But it was one of the first with real-time 3D objects in the game.
1688360	1690280	You know, on a 16-bit system.
1690280	1691280	Nice.
1691280	1694440	So yeah, Sapphire is an amazing little shooter.
1694440	1696600	And then I'd also like to see Psychic Storm.
1696600	1698680	Well, that's the game that Dan calls I Get Pissed Off.
1698680	1700440	He was saying, Psychic Storm?
1700440	1703400	But Dan sounds like they're saying I Get Pissed Off.
1703400	1707480	And Ray Iannami says, the only game that's had any translation is Sin and Punishment.
1707480	1709640	And even then, it was only menu text.
1709640	1711320	I did think of another one, though.
1711320	1712320	Tecmo Bowl.
1712320	1714320	They went back and screwed with that because they had to take out all the stuff that was
1714320	1715320	licensed originally.
1715320	1716320	Remember that?
1716320	1720360	So they have gone in and altered with ROMs, but very, very rarely.
1720360	1722860	So anyhow, we will see what happens with this release.
1722860	1723860	Maybe who knows?
1723860	1726200	Maybe tomorrow, by the time you guys hear this podcast, it could already be out.
1726200	1728800	I mean, when they say shortly, that could mean Monday.
1728800	1729800	So we'll see.
1729800	1731800	Dark Sakura, what's up next?
1731800	1738520	Well, I was actually going to look for the, see if I had covered it, but in other news,
1738520	1745880	something about Satoru Iwata, who is the Nintendo president, he's not impressed by the iPad.
1745880	1748580	Yes, the iPad happened this week.
1748580	1751040	We didn't really, I think everybody's heard.
1751040	1752040	This is the show.
1752040	1753040	Yes.
1753040	1755160	The iPad is coming out and everybody is, well, not everybody.
1755160	1756160	I just didn't see it.
1756160	1758400	Did it say that it was coming with a stylus or something?
1758400	1759400	No.
1759400	1761840	I'm criticizing it because it looks like a giant iPhone.
1761840	1762840	At least that's me.
1762840	1763840	I am criticizing it for that reason.
1763840	1767960	I would only want one if I could draw on it, you know, if it was like carrying around a
1767960	1768960	Cintiq.
1768960	1771760	I will say though, some of the art stuff on that did look very cool.
1771760	1774200	I could see like, like some of the art playing looked really cool.
1774200	1776760	And I got to say, I really liked the calendar that they showed in it.
1776760	1779920	Like I thought the calendar seemed really robust and I could really use that, but I'm
1779920	1784200	not paying $4.99 or whatever, and that's not even with 3G.
1784200	1787240	I'll tell you, actually, you know what would, what would make me buy that, Rob?
1787240	1788240	What's that?
1788240	1792280	Um, it costs the same as a Kindle and does more, and I can run my Kindle app on it.
1792280	1796600	I bet you the cost does come down, but you know Apple, in a year there'll be an iPad
1796600	1798920	2 or an iPad 2.0 or whatever.
1798920	1802240	I see myself getting one if I can actually use it for real art stuff, but I digress.
1802240	1806240	Will Loki be getting an iPad just out of curiosity?
1806240	1807240	No.
1807240	1808240	Okay.
1808240	1811800	So much he could say, but he just, he just keeps it classy.
1811800	1814080	Uh, I, I'm sorry.
1814080	1816720	Did you watch the press conference out of curiosity?
1816720	1821100	I watched the live, the live blogging of it, and I laughed.
1821100	1823600	I'm like, wow.
1823600	1828840	So people do realize this is just an iPod touch, but bigger, right?
1828840	1829840	Slightly faster processor.
1829840	1835360	Whoa, a blazing fast 1 GHz processor, oh my god, that's blazing fast like years ago.
1835360	1838000	I guess for a handheld that's blazing fast.
1838000	1841040	Let's let Jamie get back to the story, but I do want to say real quick, um, the only
1841040	1844200	thing to take me off about it too, one of the, it doesn't multitask.
1844200	1845200	Like come on.
1845200	1849480	A computer doesn't all tab, you know, so shiny and beautiful rub cause that's what people
1849480	1852420	buy Apple products for us because they're beautiful.
1852420	1853680	It's just like my wife.
1853680	1854680	Perfect example.
1854680	1859280	We went to go get a new camera cause my camera, whatever it's, let me go get you a drink,
1859280	1860280	Jamie.
1860280	1861280	I'm sorry.
1861280	1862280	I have one.
1862280	1864520	It didn't, uh, is it strong enough?
1864520	1866640	It doesn't hold a charge anymore for whatever reason.
1866640	1867640	So what did my wife do?
1867640	1870000	I want the red camera.
1870000	1874720	She's the perfect Mac Apple product buyer right there.
1874720	1876040	I want the red one.
1876040	1878640	You are incorrect, sir.
1878640	1882240	Any good graphic artist is going to primarily go for a Mac.
1882240	1883240	Great.
1883240	1887240	I hope you have a lot of art programs on the iPhone because that's the only apps that can
1887240	1888240	run.
1888240	1889240	I have Photoshop.
1889240	1890240	Oh, I'm sorry.
1890240	1891240	I don't think that's on the iPhone.
1891240	1892240	Yes it is.
1892240	1894560	Well that's a pretty piss poor version then.
1894560	1899160	It's basically just for editing photos taken, but it actually has pretty good image cleaner
1899160	1900160	in there.
1900160	1901160	I like it.
1901160	1907640	I don't, I, I have real Photoshop to actually fix my photos, but back to my story, please.
1907640	1908640	Yes.
1908640	1914160	As I was saying, you know, basically Iwata agrees with Loki.
1914160	1920000	It's a bigger, I, you know, iPod touch, whatever.
1920000	1925840	Um, he also doesn't like 3d gaming very much, uh, he did like avatar, which I've seen twice
1925840	1926840	now.
1926840	1933320	Um, and they're actually looking on the, um, effects of help, um, by playing video games
1933320	1937480	over a long period of time instead of watching movies, seeing what the differences are.
1937480	1945720	Um, I guess, um, and then, um, he also, uh, doesn't really care, you know, about, he doesn't
1945720	1950580	think people just want to wear those silly looking glasses to play their video games.
1950580	1959440	And also he said that, um, the next DS would not have motion sensor and there's no HD Wii.
1959440	1962520	He doesn't think that people would pay money for it.
1962520	1965260	Oh, Iwata.
1965260	1966800	Poor special boy.
1966800	1972240	Maybe we should put him in the, um, the, uh, crayon eating camp.
1972240	1976040	I'm not ready to put him there yet because whether we like it or not, the Wii is really
1976040	1978240	kicking ass when it comes to sales and so forth.
1978240	1979760	So maybe he just has the bicycle helmet?
1979760	1983600	We have to remember Nintendo doesn't only care about the core gamer.
1983600	1990360	They care about the soccer moms and kicking ass and Logie's wife sales console sales,
1990360	1994760	but software sales, they suck except for first party Nintendo product.
1994760	1995760	That's okay.
1995760	1997700	Nintendo has given me what I want.
1997700	1998700	I love this.
1998700	1999700	I'm holding it in my hand.
1999700	2000700	Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
2000700	2006320	Well Capcom gave you that, but it's on Wii, so they had to license it.
2006320	2010320	Um, I love this too, this comment in chat, tiger clot in our chat room chat that orange
2010320	2012640	sounds radio.com says, but guys think about it.
2012640	2015760	You can listen to OLR on a bigger screen with the all games app.
2015760	2020200	Yeah, that's bigger screens really going to help you with a radio app.
2020200	2021200	Think about it.
2021200	2025400	And you can't even put the thing in your pocket because it's so huge.
2025400	2028560	You can kind of put it like under your shirt, like maybe, maybe they need to come out with
2028560	2032740	a girdle with a pocket or something that you could carry your iPad under your shirt.
2032740	2033740	You know what's sad?
2033740	2034740	What?
2034740	2038240	The 4G 3.5 gigahertz processor probably could go into an iPhone.
2038240	2039240	And maybe it will.
2039240	2041040	There'll be a new iPhone this year too, I'm sure.
2041040	2042040	Exactly.
2042040	2045280	And then once you bought your iPad, then the 4G version will come out and you'll have to
2045280	2046280	pay.
2046280	2048520	I've told you what, the reason I want one.
2048520	2053880	I want it instead of a Kindle because it'll do what the Kindle does plus some other crap.
2053880	2056160	And I use my Kindle app on my iPhone.
2056160	2061120	Um, Game Guru says, remember this is coming from the guy who's marketing a bigger DSI.
2061120	2063240	He knows this stuff.
2063240	2065840	How's the DSI in Excel any different from the iPad?
2065840	2066840	It's not.
2066840	2068640	It's, it's, it's equally retarded, okay?
2068640	2070000	Maybe he's just jealous.
2070000	2073960	Actually, I gotta say, some people that I've heard that have played with that thing really
2073960	2074960	enjoy it.
2074960	2077640	They say it does make a big difference.
2077640	2080240	I don't know how, but that's just what I'm hearing.
2080240	2085520	Are they also the people that dial the, you know, big number phones, you know?
2085520	2086840	They have one of those oversized phones.
2086840	2088720	My fingers don't hit the buttons.
2088720	2090920	I hit one button and it hits both of them.
2090920	2093520	The kind Grandma has to have so she can see the numbers.
2093520	2097640	The ones that are like, you know, it looks like someone put Post-Its where the numbers
2097640	2098640	are.
2098640	2100640	You could use your whole fist to hit a button.
2100640	2105800	You should have whack-a-mole phones, that'd be awesome.
2105800	2106800	Nice.
2106800	2109400	Alright, how about some different gaming news, Loki?
2109400	2111680	I'm gonna open a window in here, by the way.
2111680	2112680	It's hot in the studio.
2112680	2113680	It's gettin' hot.
2113680	2114680	It's gettin' hot.
2114680	2116160	Is it hot in here, or is it just me?
2116160	2117160	It's just stuffy.
2117160	2123080	Yes, apparently there's a new Pokemon game coming out, and when I say new, I don't mean
2123080	2127600	HeartGold and SoulSilver, because those aren't really new, they're just kind of remade.
2127600	2132280	But there's basically gonna be a new game, I guess a new main entry game, as they would
2132280	2137640	call it, which will probably have, you know, two games and then one that compiles both
2137640	2141040	of them together that they'll release later on that people will buy anyways.
2141040	2147920	I didn't say when it's coming out, but sometime in 2010, it's gonna be seeing a release in
2147920	2152320	Japan, most likely probably holiday, because usually they'll have Pokemon games that come
2152320	2155720	out around April or November, so.
2155720	2162440	And I believe the April one is HeartGold, except this year it's, you know, March.
2162440	2164640	So are we gonna go online with this now?
2164640	2169140	I mean, I know they do, isn't there like the trading room over Wi-Fi or something, a very
2169140	2173520	limited kind of online app that you were able to do in the last one?
2173520	2177280	I don't know, Pokemon to me is like- When's Pokemon just gonna be an MMO already?
2177280	2181000	I mean, Nintendo is sitting on a goldmine, a Pokemon MMO I think would be huge.
2181000	2182880	But you don't want to embrace online.
2182880	2183880	Ugh.
2183880	2184880	So like, they won't.
2184880	2187960	There's one of those things they get a third party to do, seriously.
2187960	2192200	There are, I bet there's some MMO developers out there that would like, they would suck
2192200	2196640	Nintendo's cock in order to be able to put out the Pokemon MMO and get money off of that.
2196640	2199880	I mean, that is just a goldmine waiting to happen.
2199880	2203600	But Rob, then people wouldn't buy Pokemon games.
2203600	2204600	That's not true.
2204600	2209080	Just because World of Warcraft is doing amazingly well, you don't think like Starcraft 2 and
2209080	2212240	Diablo 3 are gonna sell well, and if they wanted to put out a Warcraft 4 you don't think
2212240	2213240	that would sell?
2213240	2214480	They'd still sell.
2214480	2215480	They'd still sell.
2215480	2218240	I don't know.
2218240	2222880	AzureEdsInChat says, Sky, we'd have to enter one million friend codes, I don't wanna fucking
2222880	2223880	do that.
2223880	2224880	Good point.
2224880	2227280	I don't know.
2227280	2229520	I'm showing Rob Sapphire.
2229520	2232680	I don't think you've done that as a game of the week, you're gonna need to some week.
2232680	2236480	I don't know, check the, I mean, it's been a long time, but we'll see.
2236480	2240600	Yeah, so, new Pokemon game coming from Nintendo that's like saying, oh look, there's gonna
2240600	2243920	be another Mario game coming from Nintendo.
2243920	2245160	I have done Sapphire.
2245160	2246160	When?
2246160	2247160	Episode 326.
2247160	2249960	That wasn't that long ago, that was about six months ago.
2249960	2252200	After I did Starblade and before Donkey Kong Jr.
2252200	2255280	I'm just getting old, I have bad memory, what can I say.
2255280	2259440	Yet here I am, clamoring for a Pokemon MMO, what's wrong with me?
2259440	2264480	Anyway, how about another type of MMO of sorts, at least this was one of the original MMOs,
2264480	2265480	but was it-
2265480	2271320	And we know that MMOs just draw kids across country to their, you know, pedophile friends.
2271320	2275960	So that's why they wouldn't do it because, you know, you'd hear the PR, you know, news
2275960	2280600	wire go out about some kid that went across country to find their friend and it ends up
2280600	2285680	being some 40 year old dude that really likes Pokemon and touching little kids.
2285680	2289860	If Nintendo actually sat down to think about it, there's a way to do it.
2289860	2294080	You could do friend codes maybe for just the people that you talk to and party with, especially
2294080	2298440	if you're like under a certain age, but you could still at least interact in a certain
2298440	2303940	capacity, maybe using pre- like that's how the Disney MMOs do it, there's like pre-phrases
2303940	2307340	that are in there, even the Phantasy Star games have that to some extent, the already
2307340	2311080	put in phrases that you would communicate with.
2311080	2314440	If you maybe, especially if you were under a certain age.
2314440	2316520	Or just an animal crossing MMO.
2316520	2320160	Well look, anyway, hello back to a classic MMO, Ultima!
2320160	2321840	Remember Ultima Online?
2321840	2324680	I think it's still kicking after all these years too, Ultima Online I believe is still
2324680	2325680	going.
2325680	2326680	They got a graphical upgrade a couple years ago.
2326680	2330480	Of course Ultima was a huge series of role playing games before that, I believe there
2330480	2333640	was nine games?
2333640	2334640	So there was-
2334640	2335640	I think so.
2335640	2336640	I think so.
2336640	2340280	I don't remember, but I do know that, you know, some of the early ones I remember from
2340280	2345960	my childhood, I actually had on NES, I had Ultima 4, and I used to rant Ultima 3 all
2345960	2349000	the time, so I know those were big games back in the day.
2349000	2354680	Well, and Ultima has a very, very rabid fan base, and guess what, EA is apparently bringing
2354680	2360720	out a new Ultima game, but don't get too excited because it's not quite what you think.
2360720	2365600	It's called Lord of Ultima, and it's a game where you build your own unique city, and
2365600	2370640	you play with thousands of other players, and yeah, it doesn't sound like it's really
2370640	2375600	like a role playing kind of game at all, it sounds almost more like, I don't know, Civilization
2375600	2380520	or something, which not that Civ's a bad thing, but they kind of took the Ultima out of Ultima,
2380520	2381760	I don't know.
2381760	2386400	So yeah, take with it what you will, I guess it would be hard to know until we actually
2386400	2390560	get our hands on it, but this is their idea on how to revive the Ultima franchise is to
2390560	2392800	give us Lord of Ultima.
2392800	2393800	That's silly.
2393800	2396680	How about just like a really kick ass Ultima console game?
2396680	2401640	I don't know, I guess the tricky thing about Ultima is that it really was more, it wasn't
2401640	2404600	like a Final Fantasy type of role playing game, you know, where you hit a button to
2404600	2409240	attack and all that, it was very, like you really, even on the NES one, dude, you had
2409240	2413000	to like micromanage the food that your people were eating to make sure they weren't going
2413000	2417200	to die of starvation, you had all these status effects that could happen, like your people
2417200	2421640	could die, or they could just straight up turn to ash, and you can't revive someone
2421640	2422640	who's turned to ash.
2422640	2426320	I mean, it's, it kind of kicks up the ante a little bit.
2426320	2429560	It's a tougher game to manage, but rewarding.
2429560	2432160	You know, you know what type of game I think would make a fun MMO?
2432160	2433160	What's that?
2433160	2434160	I was thinking about it.
2434160	2436200	Actraiser, where everyone plays God.
2436200	2438720	That would be a little bit confusing at some point, I don't know.
2438720	2442560	And then like, you have Holy Wars and shit for Sky Cake.
2442560	2443560	Nice.
2443560	2444560	Okay.
2444560	2446120	Well, how about another story?
2446120	2448440	How about Borderlands?
2448440	2451560	Which is what my husband was playing this morning.
2451560	2460560	So, the secret armory of General Knox is the next download content to be coming out.
2460560	2470880	And it's supposed to have, like, really cool new enemies and a big new place to hang out.
2470880	2478000	And I really have to say that if it's anything like the island of Dr. Ned, then it's going
2478000	2479000	to be fun.
2479000	2480000	It's going to be pretty great.
2480000	2482720	So, they're raising the level cap.
2482720	2486000	We don't know how much, but it's raising the level cap.
2486000	2488120	And right now it's at 50.
2488120	2490800	So, maybe they'll get legendary mounts next.
2490800	2497320	How about instead of an add-on like the island of Dr. Ned, we get the island of Dr. Brain.
2497320	2500600	Because that was an amazing game.
2500600	2503840	The island of Dr. Ned involved a lot of brains.
2503840	2504840	I see.
2504840	2507760	Involved timed headshots that would make the zombies.
2507760	2512200	You had to, I'm not going to say why you had to collect the brains, but it was pretty funny.
2512200	2515920	But, like, you had to get headshots on all the zombies to make their brains pop out of
2515920	2519040	their head, and then you would collect their brains.
2519040	2523200	And as you turned in your brains, like, your first mission is brains.
2523200	2525320	Your second mission is brains.
2525320	2527460	Your third mission is brains.
2527460	2528720	Like the A's would keep increasing.
2528720	2530440	It was pretty funny.
2530440	2533580	And yeah.
2533580	2539720	Let's travel around the world while Jamie goes and eats some brains.
2539720	2541640	Or maybe some of these yummy potato chips like that.
2541640	2544080	I would love some pita chips.
2544080	2545080	Walgreens.
2545080	2548520	These pita chips, yes, thank you.
2548520	2549840	Ah, yes.
2549840	2554680	This week is kind of the calm before the storm as far as releases go.
2554680	2558480	Not a lot of good stuff coming out, unfortunately.
2558480	2559840	So instead we have-
2559840	2561160	Bite your tongue.
2561160	2562160	Bite your tongue.
2562160	2564440	White Knight Chronicles is this week.
2564440	2565440	Oh, that's right.
2565440	2568800	Well, I said not a lot of good stuff.
2568800	2569800	One title-
2569800	2570800	Sorry, I'm choking on a pita chip.
2570800	2573040	I'm sorry, two titles do not a good week make.
2573040	2578760	Anyways, so, Imagine Reporter, coming out on DS, whoopity shit.
2578760	2582120	Star Trek Online, though, is making it out this week, both the collector's edition and
2582120	2583680	the regular edition.
2583680	2587940	White Knight Chronicles on PlayStation 3 coming out, and that wraps up the good games coming
2587940	2588940	out this week.
2588940	2593280	And also Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun on the Wii.
2593280	2600680	The Sims 3 high-end lost stuff, if you want to buy more crap for your fake people.
2600680	2603280	And that would be it.
2603280	2606800	All right.
2606800	2613680	Sorry, I'm playing around in chat room because somebody said, or it was Azurette, did someone
2613680	2620660	say pita chips, but spelled it P-E-T-A, like the people eating tasty animals.
2620660	2624040	And then I tried to slap them, but I accidentally slapped the wrong person in chat, so there
2624040	2625040	we go.
2625040	2628240	I gave the right person a slap there in the chat room.
2628240	2631240	Anyway, hey, how about Japan and looking at the Japanese releases?
2631240	2634360	I don't know if there's any games in Japan where you can slap people yet.
2634360	2635440	We might need to let Shermie out.
2635440	2638200	Shermie's headed towards the door and wants to- there we go.
2638200	2639200	Bye, Shermie.
2639200	2640200	All right.
2640200	2641200	Sorry.
2641200	2644520	Shermie's a cat, by the way, that I'm talking to.
2644520	2650440	Hey, looking at the release dates over in Japan, kind of a slow week over there.
2650440	2652320	Well, I guess they do have a new Star Ocean game.
2652320	2653320	That's a pretty big deal.
2653320	2657840	On the PS3, that's Star Ocean The Last Hope, but that's the international version, so I'm
2657840	2661240	assuming it's kind of like they did with some of the Final Fantasy games where it's the
2661240	2662240	US version redone.
2662240	2667940	It's the US version with more- I think there's more language options.
2667940	2670200	And honestly, that is really it.
2670200	2677240	I mean, there's another game on the PS2 called Momo Tuji Taisen Ryoku 2 coming from System
2677240	2681480	Soft that looks to be some type of adventure game.
2681480	2685760	I don't know if it's just- there's little cute little animals there and that poor girl's
2685760	2687280	sitting in a cardboard box.
2687280	2691400	I don't know why, but I guess it's about a bunch of homeless chicks with big boobs.
2691400	2692400	I don't know.
2692400	2693400	No, they're all planes.
2693400	2694400	Did you notice that they're all planes?
2694400	2695400	Oh, they're planes.
2695400	2696520	They are.
2696520	2700240	Are these- oh, these girls must like turn into planes or something, right?
2700240	2701240	It's just weird.
2701240	2702240	Yeah.
2702240	2703800	Oh, the Japanese and their fetishes.
2703800	2704800	That is so strange.
2704800	2706320	Her ass is a cardboard box.
2706320	2707320	Look at that.
2707320	2709560	I gotta link that in chat there.
2709560	2710560	She's a hobo plane.
2710560	2712240	I'll paste the link there.
2712240	2716560	I'm gonna paste that in chat so you guys can check that out and see if it's a weird deal.
2716560	2718600	Alright, so that's on the PlayStation 2.
2718600	2721240	So they are still cranking out the PS2 games over there.
2721240	2727840	And on the Sony PSP, God Eater comes out.
2727840	2730000	Well, that sounds rather pleasant on the PSP.
2730000	2731800	I don't know if that- is that local?
2731800	2734120	Is that a- some type of game we have here?
2734120	2736120	I think it's based off of manga.
2736120	2737120	Yeah.
2737120	2740120	Oh, it is.
2740120	2741960	Looks like a- It's a fighting game.
2741960	2745920	Yeah, kind of a fighting game, but you can take on multiple things at once.
2745920	2746920	Pretty cool.
2746920	2747920	Yeah.
2747920	2749840	And that's it for Japanese release dates.
2749840	2750840	How about the UK?
2750840	2751840	Jamie?
2751840	2754920	Well, for the third, we have Chime on Xbox 360.
2754920	2757680	And then the fifth, we have a number of things.
2757680	2759840	We have Dante's Inferno.
2759840	2765700	We have Disgaea 2, Dark Hero Days, Endless Ocean 2, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,
2765700	2775520	The Crystal Bearers, MX vs. ATV Reflex, Stalker Call of Pripyat, Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2775520	2779560	Please everybody, it's not- it's not Silent Hill as you know it.
2779560	2782720	If you like running, you'll love Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2782720	2785920	If you like a lot of frustrating fucking trial and error, then you'll like it.
2785920	2786920	You just run.
2786920	2789120	They should've- they should've- this is kind of funny.
2789120	2792640	They should've combined Walk It Out with Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2792640	2794560	Wouldn't that be hilarious?
2794560	2797680	Well, last on my list is the best on the list.
2797680	2798680	Star Trek Online.
2798680	2800520	Um, I have already been playing it.
2800520	2805200	It is tons of fun, um, although now that the beta's over, I have to remake my fucking character.
2805200	2807440	Yeah, but you should've known that was coming.
2807440	2808440	Well, yeah.
2808440	2811880	Actually, I didn't have to when I played, um, Ragnarok Online.
2811880	2812960	Oh, buh-bye.
2812960	2815960	They saved the character data on a separate server so that when you start the game, you
2815960	2816960	have your character attack.
2816960	2817960	Did you like the ship combat?
2817960	2818960	I didn't like it.
2818960	2819960	I didn't like the camera in it.
2819960	2820960	Yeah.
2820960	2825680	But they're supposed to, um, have been implementing, um, cause I've been giving a lot of feedback
2825680	2826680	on the dev forum.
2826680	2830240	They're supposed to be, um, doing a way to lock- cause my whole problem was that you
2830240	2833600	couldn't lock the camera behind your ship.
2833600	2839680	That really pissed me off, because it really- your controls were always justified by your
2839680	2846880	ship, but if you were not- if you were, like, looking at your ship sideways, you could not
2846880	2851600	turn it around, adjust your camera, do anything without it trying to readjust itself based
2851600	2855280	on where your enemy was, and it would never lock on the enemy when you were close by.
2855280	2863720	So it'd be like, um, I'm trying to shoot these, uh, Borg, um, I'm trying to shoot these, uh,
2863720	2864720	whatever they are.
2864720	2869080	Um, I did, though, I really liked the away missions.
2869080	2870080	Those were fun.
2870080	2874920	Yeah, the- I liked it when you were on the world, kind of in the- as the player, but
2874920	2875920	I didn't care for the-
2875920	2879240	I liked the one mission, I don't know if you did it, it was one of your emergency missions,
2879240	2882760	where you have to go and talk to these miners, and you find out why they're so pissed off
2882760	2883760	at their boss.
2883760	2884760	No.
2884760	2887560	I think it was- it was such a great thing that it had, like, diplomatic missions and
2887560	2891880	little things in there, stuff that, you know, I'm sure Starfleet officers have to do all
2891880	2892880	the time.
2892880	2895440	I played through the whole Borg opening, and then I did a couple other missions, like,
2895440	2899520	I remember going on some ship to get the- like, get- like, kill a bunch of guys that
2899520	2902840	were trying to infiltrate the ship and get on the ship and get the people out.
2902840	2904480	They would follow me, kind of, to the exit.
2904480	2905480	Yeah.
2905480	2908360	Yeah, that was- and then more bad guys were showing up, so I was running out.
2908360	2912080	Well, the missions that I- I was actually on the way to the- whatever the mission was
2912080	2917720	near Vulcan or something, and you get emergency missions sometimes on your way as you pass
2917720	2921920	by other places, although really what- the first thing I'm gonna freakin' do as soon
2921920	2926600	as my ship is up to it is go hang out at DS9 for a while.
2926600	2927600	It's in there!
2927600	2928600	It's in there!
2928600	2929600	Did you know?
2929600	2930600	That's nice.
2930600	2931600	No, I didn't know that.
2931600	2932600	That's great.
2932600	2933600	There's a video up of someone actually trying to go through the wormhole.
2933600	2934600	I think it was funny.
2934600	2935600	Awesome.
2935600	2939280	All right, well, what's up next?
2939280	2940280	Back to some gaming news.
2940280	2944000	I just totally made myself an utter geek.
2944000	2945580	I know.
2945580	2951000	You know, I wanna, like, uh, play Star Trek Online and then just kill all the creatures.
2951000	2954280	You know how they- do they have any diplomatic away missions where you're supposed to not
2954280	2956520	kill things, and then if you do, that's bad?
2956520	2959480	I think those you just are actually set to talk to them, because you can't actually fire
2959480	2963400	at someone who's not an enemy, but you should totally play a Klingon.
2963400	2964400	That's unfortunate.
2964400	2966360	You should totally play a Klingon.
2966360	2969400	See, that's what I do in Spore, is just kill people.
2969400	2973680	Oh, wait, no, I don't do that in Spore, because I don't play Spore anymore.
2973680	2974680	That's right.
2974680	2979080	You should just totally play a Klingon, then you can call your commanding officer, uh,
2979080	2982640	you know, a coward, and then kill him and take his position.
2982640	2987160	And you know what Spore has to do with this next, uh, story they have?
2987160	2989560	Well, both of them have DRM.
2989560	2993960	Ubisoft is now introducing a new online-enabled DRM for their PC games.
2993960	3000960	Um, basically, you're gonna be able to install the game on, um, you know, whatever PCs you
3000960	3001960	want.
3001960	3008600	You just have to be connected to, um, the internet in order to be logged into your Ubi.com
3008600	3013440	account to play the games, even if you wanna just play, uh, single-player games.
3013440	3017680	Uh, sounds wonderful and all, but somehow I have a feeling that they're gonna get around
3017680	3023920	it just as easy as they got around the DRM on the EA games, but hey, I guess that's neat.
3023920	3028120	And stuff that they don't limit you to how many PCs you can install your stuff onto,
3028120	3034000	but you know, some people out there don't have internet access or don't have broadband
3034000	3038880	internet access, but I guess those people won't be buying those Ubisoft games.
3038880	3043500	Just hopefully they make it very clear, um, on there.
3043500	3049280	But um, I guess, uh, this is kinda similar to some of the Steam games that they have
3049280	3054000	out there now that they require that you're logged in, um, to the internet.
3054000	3056960	But I guess that's not true for all Steam games?
3056960	3058840	I don't know.
3058840	3060280	Well, here's the question.
3060280	3063680	I mean, I understand these gaming companies have to do whatever they have to do to try
3063680	3066880	and curb piracy because it's getting way out of control, especially on PC games, it's so
3066880	3067880	easy.
3067880	3071920	But, um, you know, there's always somebody gonna play that card, like, okay, well, if
3071920	3076920	you require an internet connection to validate the game, what happens to the military guys
3076920	3080880	overseas who don't have an internet connection and these computer games are a way that they
3080880	3083720	can, you know, de-stress in downtime?
3083720	3089180	That card always gets played somehow, so what is, I mean, any DRM scheme has to kinda take
3089180	3092960	that stuff into consideration is, you know, there are some people who legitimately don't
3092960	3096840	have internet and are trying to legitimately play games.
3096840	3098440	Could they call an 800 number?
3098440	3099440	I mean, I don't know.
3099440	3100440	What would happen?
3100440	3104480	I think it's not, they're not gonna be able to call an 800 number and really what's gonna
3104480	3112200	come down to is any DRM scheme that you have out there, really there's no way that you're
3112200	3118320	gonna be able to ensure that people aren't stealing your product because there's always
3118320	3122780	gonna be a way around everything, whether it be, you know, some extremes I can see them
3122780	3128080	going to is a physical dongle that you have to stick into your USB drive or something
3128080	3132080	like that that authenticates your, you know, copy that you have and you can't play unless
3132080	3133640	that's plugged in there.
3133640	3139280	They do that with some software programs out there, but it's very rare and even those can
3139280	3145400	be emulated or, you know, copied and, you know, nothing's perfect.
3145400	3148720	Well here's what Frisbee in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com and just makes
3148720	3149960	a very clear statement.
3149960	3153280	Frisbee says DRM will always be cracked.
3153280	3154280	Give it up.
3154280	3155280	Agree?
3155280	3156280	Yeah.
3156280	3165640	Really, and even DLC can be cracked and always is, so you just can't win in the PC market.
3165640	3169520	You just have to, you know, hope that most people aren't pirating your stuff.
3169520	3172380	Or you're putting it out at a price that makes it worth it.
3172380	3173380	I don't know.
3173380	3174380	Yeah.
3174380	3177620	Steam, you know, Steam's a great service and a lot of people, you know, purchase stuff
3177620	3179640	on Steam because it's very convenient.
3179640	3184440	It's all in one, you know, spot, but there's people that are gonna pirate games that are
3184440	3189080	gonna pirate games and there's nothing really stopping them because, you know, as soon as
3189080	3194480	you tell somebody, oh this is, you know, if, you know, if it's something that's gonna inconvenience
3194480	3199320	somebody, you know, whether it be, you know, requiring a disk or you have to be online
3199320	3204800	or you have to install this, you know, some sort of rootkit on your system in order for
3204800	3209560	it to work, someone's getting pissed off and trying to hack it around.
3209560	3212400	Some more comments from chat and Frisbee makes another point here.
3212400	3216920	What happens to the servers, or what happens when the servers, when they crap out?
3216920	3219760	So if these servers that authenticate the games or whatever, what happens if they die?
3219760	3223040	They're gonna send out a patch and it'll probably remove the DRM from the game.
3223040	3228280	What if, what if all the servers, well that's, that's Steam's contingency plan, supposedly.
3228280	3231420	If Steam were to ever disappear, they would do that.
3231420	3235400	But that isn't the same thing that Ubisoft has necessarily said, I don't know.
3235400	3239160	Ray Iannami says, if I was a developer, I'd just say fuck it to DRM and just put in a
3239160	3242640	finger wagging message that says, while we thank you for your interest in this game,
3242640	3246480	we would appreciate it if you buy a legitimate copy if possible.
3246480	3250880	You know, I have to admit, I always did like the kind of gotcha thing that some of those
3250880	3252520	Super Nintendo games did.
3252520	3253520	Like, what was it?
3253520	3259160	One of those games, if you were playing like a hacked version, Earthbound, would be way
3259160	3260160	harder.
3260160	3263320	Like if you were playing like a pirated copy of Earthbound, it would be way harder.
3263320	3266120	And then when you get to the very last boss, it deletes your save game.
3266120	3268440	Like that's just evil, but kind of funny in a way.
3268440	3272560	I mean, if somebody's pirating it, they can't complain at what the game did.
3272560	3276040	I mean, it might make them really pissed off so they never actually buy the game legitimately.
3276040	3280800	But just kind of, most people didn't know that that kind of prevention was in there
3280800	3284280	until it was too late.
3284280	3287520	Frisbee continues and says DRM does nothing to stop piracy.
3287520	3289140	Just screws over real players.
3289140	3291160	What pirate would keep DRM in the game?
3291160	3295220	The other thing too, DRM, especially if it's not made in-house, although Oobies might be
3295220	3298960	made in-house or they may be licensed, I don't know if they're licensing it from somebody
3298960	3299960	else.
3299960	3301840	But I mean, that costs these companies money too.
3301840	3307640	So if it's just going to get defeated like immediately, then you might as well just save
3307640	3313440	the money and just not have it, you know, cracked or just not have the DRM in there.
3313440	3317480	Just save whatever, at least I'm going to save myself, you know, X amount of thousands
3317480	3318480	of dollars.
3318480	3323280	Uh, D5T in chat kind of half jokes here, next gen consoles will need a pin drop of your
3323280	3325400	blood to start the game up.
3325400	3328560	Well hey, don't they already have laptops now that are like fingerprints or something?
3328560	3329560	Biometric scanner.
3329560	3330560	Yeah.
3330560	3336280	As that technology comes down, maybe not your blood, but your fingerprint, who knows?
3336280	3337280	Could you imagine that?
3337280	3339960	You had to, you have to press your fingerprint in order to start a game?
3339960	3344960	Well why don't they look at, well, I guess, I was going to say why don't they look at
3344960	3351360	how, you know, console games are doing DRM and stuff like that, you know, why don't they
3351360	3355000	look at that and try to kind of match something that they're doing there?
3355000	3356000	I don't know.
3356000	3360360	A decipher in chat reminds us, um, I think speaking of my whole little earthbound story
3360360	3362400	there, that happened with a recent release of a game.
3362400	3366140	A guy complained in the forums of a bug and it outed him as a pirate.
3366140	3367520	That was an Arkham Asylum, wasn't it?
3367520	3373760	Like there was some type of trick that Batman would, couldn't do in the copied version and
3373760	3377200	somebody went to the forums to complain about it and it, it, that's how they knew that he
3377200	3379080	pirated the game.
3379080	3382200	That's, I mean, at the same time, I mean, I kind of look at that and go, that's kind
3382200	3383200	of funny.
3383200	3384760	I mean, they're within the rights to do that.
3384760	3386600	They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto IV.
3386600	3390480	You'd have the drunk cam on all the time if you, you know, pirate the game so your camera
3390480	3392140	would be shaking around like you're drunk.
3392140	3396120	But there was like a patch within like a week, you know, of it coming out that fixed that.
3396120	3398360	And you know, same with the Arkham Asylum stuff.
3398360	3403640	There was a patch already fixing that problem, you know, within a week or so.
3403640	3408320	And it's just not going to really matter.
3408320	3411400	Everybody's going to find a way around it no matter what you do.
3411400	3415720	So you might as well just give up because, you know, all you're doing is laying the inevitable
3415720	3416720	and wasting money.
3416720	3421280	All right, well, let's move on to one more story here before we get to the classic game
3421280	3422280	of the week.
3422280	3426200	And this has to do with what I believe will be a highly anticipated game.
3426200	3430600	Hopefully this doesn't get pirated too much though because this is some real A-list talent
3430600	3431600	behind this.
3431600	3433360	It's the folks at Platinum Games.
3433360	3436120	If I'm not mistaken, Platinum Games actually did Bayonetta recently.
3436120	3437120	Yes, they did.
3437120	3438120	They were the minds behind that.
3438120	3440200	They were developed by Devil May Cry Dude.
3440200	3441500	We had a new game announced this week.
3441500	3446560	It's from Platinum Games but the mastermind behind this is Shinji Mikami and he's the
3446560	3448360	guy behind Resident Evil.
3448360	3449520	The game looks awesome.
3449520	3453240	It's called Vanquish is the game that Loki is referring to.
3453240	3455960	Vanquish appears to be a futuristic shooter game.
3455960	3460720	I guess it takes place in San Francisco so kind of not that far from here.
3460720	3466800	I guess it's in the future and well, obviously there's not a lot known about the actual game
3466800	3467800	itself.
3467800	3471960	The trailer used a bunch of cut scenes and live action stuff.
3471960	3474680	Did you actually watch the whole debut on TV or the YouTube trailer?
3474680	3475680	I watched the trailer though.
3475680	3476680	Yeah?
3476680	3477680	What did you think?
3477680	3478680	I think it looks cool.
3478680	3479680	I'm definitely excited for it.
3479680	3482360	It looks like something that will be on the next gen consoles.
3482360	3483840	Not a Wii game.
3483840	3486360	But even their Wii game, Madworld, is pretty awesome.
3486360	3493960	Unfortunately, not a lot of people play mature games on the Wii which is really sad but really
3493960	3495400	sweet game.
3495400	3499040	I think for Platinum Games what they really should do on some of these mature titles that
3499040	3502920	they put out for the Wii is just re-release them on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
3502920	3504120	I think that would be a great idea.
3504120	3509120	Madworld, port that sucker with high definition graphics to the 360.
3509120	3512320	It would sell like crazy.
3512320	3513640	So you don't have the motion controls in there.
3513640	3514640	Big deal.
3514640	3516800	Just use something with the right analog stick or something.
3516800	3517800	I don't know.
3517800	3519680	It would be pretty awesome.
3519680	3521760	But this new game looks really cool.
3521760	3523720	I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit more about it.
3523720	3526680	Yeah because we don't even know what platform it's on.
3526680	3533600	We can assume like Bayonetta it will be PS3 and 360 but we don't know that for sure yet.
3533600	3536600	And we don't know if it's going to be like multiplayer.
3536600	3537960	We don't know much about that yet.
3537960	3539160	But more to come soon.
3539160	3542080	I imagine this is going to be an E3 All-Star right here.
3542080	3543080	Probably.
3543080	3544080	It's going to be something you're hearing a lot about at E3.
3544080	3545560	It's called Vanquish.
3545560	3546560	So look out for that.
3546560	3549560	Obviously Bayonetta, we're huge fans of that here at OLR.
3549560	3554760	Although this is, I mean it's still the same studio but it sounds like a different branch.
3554760	3555960	So anything could happen here.
3555960	3559040	But Outlook so far looks pretty good.
3559040	3561400	I think all their Platinum games have been really good.
3561400	3570200	It's just, I don't know, unfortunately just mature games don't do well on the Wii.
3570200	3571480	That's too bad.
3571480	3572960	But this one's not going to be on the Wii right?
3572960	3573960	I hope not.
3573960	3575640	I don't think it will be.
3575640	3576640	It didn't look like it.
3576640	3579080	Based on the graphics you saw you're thinking no right?
3579080	3580080	Alright.
3580080	3585040	Alright well let's take a trip down memory lane and some of the classics we always hear
3585040	3591360	every week at OLR like take a trip and take a look at the classic video game of the week.
3591360	3595360	It's a chance for Dark Soccer to go into gaming's vault and pull out a game that she thinks
3595360	3597720	y'all should be checking this game out right now.
3597720	3603000	And just a side note, I do notice, because Jamie had a game picked out last week but
3603000	3604000	we didn't end up doing the show.
3604000	3605000	I did?
3605000	3606000	Yeah you had a game.
3606000	3607000	I don't know what I picked out.
3607000	3608000	But you changed it.
3608000	3609000	I did?
3609000	3610000	I don't remember what I picked out last week.
3610000	3614440	Do you want me to tell you or do you want to wait?
3614440	3615640	I don't have to look.
3615640	3619560	I'll look it up while you talk about this week's game.
3619560	3621840	But I fully approve of what you've picked for this week.
3621840	3622840	So tell our chatters.
3622840	3623840	It's about damn time I did this one.
3623840	3625320	It's about damn time.
3625320	3629320	This week's game is Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.
3629320	3633080	And I would love to play the music but one of those audio difficulties I warned you about
3633080	3638280	before the show was that some things are not installed including Flash so I can't use YouTube
3638280	3639520	just yet.
3639520	3645600	Never fear though I think I have some of the ripped files here on my drive so I'll pull
3645600	3646600	those up instead.
3646600	3647600	Sorry Jamie.
3647600	3654560	Well in Japan it was called Zelda no Densetsu Kamigami no Toraifosu which was the Legend
3654560	3659480	of Zelda Triforce of the Gods.
3659480	3665920	This is arranged but still.
3665920	3673160	Anyway it was one of the ones that was very closely worked on by Miyamoto so of course
3673160	3675840	it was awesome.
3675840	3681760	Anyway this is you know it's basically Link's hanging out in Hyrule you know kicking Ganon's
3681760	3688040	ass going to the dark world and of course it's been re-released on the Game Boy Advance
3688040	3690040	and on the Virtual Console.
3690040	3695160	I just think it's so funny that like when you go into the dark world Link turns into
3695160	3700000	a bunny because it's supposed to reflect like your innermost self or something.
3700000	3703600	Yeah but I mean you had all kinds of cool attacks and you could go get the Master Sword
3703600	3710360	by running through the forest and you could swim and just one of the big things that got
3710360	3716840	me is because it had that sort of dual world aspect to it that you could often do things
3716840	3718940	in one world that would affect the other.
3718940	3724600	Like for example when you're going to the ice level in the dark world if you would have
3724600	3732520	to throw your portal like in one place and then walk to a certain place in the light
3732520	3741360	world and then use your mirror again and you would be inside the walls of the fortress.
3741360	3749060	So that was pretty cool and I really really liked just the overall play to it and this
3749060	3752560	is a game that I have gone back and just played a bajillion times over.
3752560	3759680	I mean I probably have whole sections of this game completely freaking memorized.
3759680	3767440	I was actually watching people glitching out the game today by trying to run a dash when
3767440	3774040	you call the bird with the ocarina that I think is in the DS version.
3774040	3779360	Yeah which reminds me there is a DS version and of course the Virtual Console version.
3779360	3792600	But yeah the game came out for the Super Famicom in Japan and it was released in 1991 and in
3792600	3797720	the US and Europe in 1992 and you know it was funny I'll tell you another funny thing
3797720	3799920	about this one Rob.
3799920	3800920	Is that.
3800920	3801920	Hey look what I got.
3801920	3802920	I got the real music here.
3802920	3803920	Look at that.
3803920	3815040	I'm sorry I just have to say for a minute I'm sorry Jamie I know you have more to say
3815040	3818240	but I saw it because there's a lot of controversy going on in chat right now like some people
3818240	3820120	say and I love this game so I'm saying I hate this game.
3820120	3823760	I personally well not that they hate it but it's not the best in the series.
3823760	3827240	By far my favorite Zelda game they ever put out.
3827240	3832440	Great music great gameplay I this is by far my favorite Zelda game ever.
3832440	3833440	Love it.
3833440	3834440	I love it too.
3834440	3843320	Although I do really like Ocarina but now this actually there was a little bit more
3843320	3844320	to this one.
3844320	3848680	Actually did you know that there was a comic that came out.
3848680	3853680	It was actually published in Nintendo Power and they put it out in the US too.
3853680	3856320	Do you remember that Rob?
3856320	3858680	The Zelda comic from Nintendo Power.
3858680	3859680	Very vaguely.
3859680	3861160	Here we go.
3861160	3866240	There's actually a picture from it if any of that looks familiar.
3866240	3871360	It's by the same guy who did the I think who did Howard and Esther.
3871360	3874760	Yeah I vaguely remember it.
3874760	3880020	Well at any rate there was another follow up to Link to the Past that came out in Japan
3880020	3886440	it was BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban which is BS The Legend of Zelda ancient stone
3886440	3891840	tablets or stone tablets of antiquity that was one of the Satellaview games and you could
3891840	3895240	voice broadcast using the sound link.
3895240	3900120	And it was supposed to be set around the same time as Link's Awakening but you don't use
3900120	3903720	Link you play as the heroes of light.
3903720	3910520	And who they are are the Satellaview mascots who you could also see in BS Zelda no Densetsu
3910520	3917800	which I had the Satellaview one ran on like a time system and there are hacked ROMs out
3917800	3924400	there where you can play with your time counter turned off.
3924400	3931240	And then there was another version of Link to the Past that came out on Satellaview as
3931240	3932240	well.
3932240	3942640	Then of course there was Link to the Past and Four Swords there was also if I'm right
3942640	3947000	I think they actually reserved a lot of the sound effects for Ocarina of Time and Majora's
3947000	3949840	Mask so that was pretty cool.
3949840	3955520	But that is overall I'd have to say probably my favorite in this series.
3955520	3958640	Very worthy.
3958640	3964480	If no one's played this game I pity you, I pity Dafuq.
3964480	3967520	They'll get it on Virtual Console, seriously, at least.
3967520	3970040	You can actually get the cart kind of cheap too.
3970040	3973360	Just one thing to remember is it doesn't run on a battery backup so you have to be really
3973360	3974360	careful.
3974360	3975360	We still have our saved games.
3975360	3979120	I actually this is one of the games now that I'll just sit and play with the Game Genie
3979120	3984680	on just so I can just run through the whole game because I mean for me what I like to
3984680	3988320	do is I like to play through the game once without cheating and then I like to just cheat
3988320	3995160	like a mofo the second time through and just enjoy the story but even so I mean this wasn't
3995160	3996160	super super hard.
3996160	3997160	There were really difficult parts.
3997160	3998160	This is some of my favorite music in the game right here.
3998160	3999160	I love this song.
3999160	4000160	In the early palaces.
4000160	4001160	Sorry.
4001160	4011120	No, I like that music too.
4011120	4017320	I never liked the palace music from the...
4017320	4024000	This is the forest music.
4024000	4026000	One of the most amazing game soundtracks ever.
4026000	4030120	I know a lot of people think like Final Fantasies where all the music's at but this seriously
4030120	4034120	seriously Zelda's got just awesome music.
4034120	4039200	Well you know the big thing actually this it's actually showing baking through the palace.
4039200	4042440	I love the little touches in it like if you had the places that you could fall off the
4042440	4047760	cliff you can make the guys charge you and they would run off the ledge or you could
4047760	4051120	throw a pot at them and they would fall off on the ledge.
4051120	4052120	You know I thought that was great.
4052120	4053520	Or you could just throw a chicken off the ledge.
4053520	4057240	Actually you know what one of my favorite levels in this one was where you go to the
4057240	4062040	thieves village and you have to take the girl into the sunlight and she turns into blind
4062040	4063040	the thief.
4063040	4064040	That's right.
4064040	4070680	And that was and I love the this is the game that made the hookshot replace the boomerang.
4070680	4076440	Was it just me or was the hookshot the single best item in the damn game?
4076440	4079120	That and the freaking medallions?
4079120	4080800	Maybe I do remember the hookshot being pretty odd.
4080800	4086880	The bombos medallion it sets the world on fire it was fantastic but yeah this totally
4086880	4088600	totally totally totally my game.
4088600	4092760	All right there it is your classic game of the week a true classic in many respects Zelda
4092760	4096320	A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo.
4096320	4100160	And most surprisingly Dark Sakura picked a non-sega game this week I'm very proud.
4100160	4104000	By the way Rob I do have something that I might be able to lend you if you've still
4104000	4105000	got Super Nintendo.
4105000	4107520	I don't know if I have a Super Nintendo still.
4107520	4109280	Didn't we give you the Super Nintendo?
4109280	4110280	No it was a regular Nintendo.
4110280	4111280	Oh okay.
4111280	4113080	In the midst of moving too is not a good time.
4113080	4114080	Well I mean later.
4114080	4115560	But in a month yeah.
4115560	4117640	We have two copies of Super Mario RPG.
4117640	4121800	Oh sweet sweet I need to find my copy of Super Metroid that's a game I really want to play
4121800	4122800	again.
4122800	4123800	Maybe we have another one?
4123800	4125320	I could do the Wii console thing but you know.
4125320	4128200	There's something about playing Super Metroid on the right system.
4128200	4130440	It's having the Super Nintendo controller.
4130440	4131440	It's having that same controller.
4131440	4134960	Rob you need to call in sick to work and hang out with me tonight and play some Super Metroid.
4134960	4140960	I would love to if I could but maybe now here's the great thing when I get the place when
4140960	4145080	I get my new place it's gonna be by myself I can set it all up without having without
4145080	4149120	anybody complaining or having other things so you could just come over we plug in the
4149120	4152720	system we're good to go we broadcast we can do that kind of stuff on the fly a lot easier
4152720	4153720	it's gonna be amazing.
4153720	4154720	That's what we should do.
4154720	4155720	Excited.
4155720	4159640	Anyhow that's gonna do it for this part A here tonight but we're not done yet we got
4159640	4163280	plenty more show coming part B is just around the corner and in part B tonight we're gonna
4163280	4167360	hear about a variety of different topics including game room we have a little more information
4167360	4173560	on game room a Microsoft and Capcom collaboration and you know just cuz Jamie really wanted
4173560	4176960	to talk about it tonight we have a story on Doctor Who as well so we have some Doctor
4176960	4179200	Who news coming up in part B tonight.
4179200	4183780	So we'll be and it does relate to video games yes it does although I know a lot of you nerds
4183780	4184780	like them both.
4184780	4186440	It's not Trump's is it?
4186440	4190280	No we'll talk more about that in part B by the way speaking of nerds since it isn't coming
4190280	4195360	up later in the show and shows that nerds like anyone watch Caprica by chance I know
4195360	4199600	it's free on Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 some of the early reviews I heard on it were very
4199600	4205160	good I downloaded the free version on PlayStation 3 because I think it hit that marketplace
4205160	4209560	couple days before the Xbox one you can download the pilot for free in HD so I still want to
4209560	4215320	check that out maybe I'll see if the chat has anything to say about Caprica while we
4215320	4218460	take a break tonight but for those of you on the podcast we'll be back in just a couple
4218460	4228280	seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4228280	4232200	Hello everybody out there and welcome back to another part B here at Orange Lounge Radio
4232200	4237920	it's episode number 353 and trying to have fun with our new mixing board and some of
4237920	4241480	our audio setup we're still trying to get you just used to some things and the podcast
4241480	4244840	listeners won't really hear this but the live listeners are hearing some interesting fluctuation
4244840	4249960	in our audio when we stop the recording so we're still trying to figure everything out
4249960	4254840	here at OLR Studios but for the most part the feedback we're getting so far is that
4254840	4258680	the soundboard sounds really good in fact I was going to get into Twitter topics a little
4258680	4263380	bit here but one of the early tweets I have here is from Blue Swim on Twitter saying at
4263380	4268960	OLR very nice soundboard hope you guys get to try it out tonight and yes we're here we're
4268960	4274200	live so I hope he's listening alright so we'll get back into some Twitter topics in just
4274200	4278360	a minute but first I thought we could get into some rapid fire news here in studio we
4278360	4283920	have a lot a lot of news to cover tonight so Loki what's on deck yes lots of Capcom
4283920	4290200	release dates including Super Street Fighter IV has been announced to be coming out in
4290200	4298560	North America on April 27th Lost Planet 2 also now on May 18th and I don't believe it
4298560	4306040	was in the article here but Monster Hunter Tri coming out April 20th as well they're
4306040	4312800	waiting to announce that because of the classic controller pro being bundled in there one
4312800	4320680	game though that is going to be not coming out soon will be No More Heroes Paradise the
4320680	4326280	kind of Xbox 360 Playstation 3 port of the Wii title that was originally supposed to
4326280	4333280	be coming out in Japan on February 25th however now it's been pushed back and no word yet
4333280	4338340	on when it's going to come out they're looking maybe at some point in April now and then
4338340	4345040	finally Red Steel 2 also right around the corner coming out March 23rd in the US and
4345040	4350680	also March 26th in Europe and that'll be available both the game by itself and bundled with Wii
4350680	4356120	Motion Plus because the game does require Wii Motion Plus but it's kind of neat and
4356120	4363440	looks pretty awesome way better than the first one which is a relief alright well I got some
4363440	4367560	news for you as well including God of War 3 I was talking about a little bit during
4367560	4373080	my gaming week watching the demo get played there it is dated March 16th is the date that
4373080	4377360	this game is coming out that's not that far away that's only like a month and a half if
4377360	4382280	that there's a lot of good games coming out in the spring this is a very weird year that
4382280	4386920	we have so many I mean usually there's a couple big games in the spring but we have a lot
4386920	4394840	I mean March 16th is just a week after Final Fantasy 13 isn't it yeah that's a huge PS3
4394840	4398920	and 360 to be fair title as well I mean this is huge there's also an ultimate edition by
4398920	4403800	the way of God of War 3 coming out there's going to be a replica Pandora's box that will
4403800	4408800	have the game in it there's also be some DLC included as well as some other collectibles
4408800	4414160	of course God of War 3 is a PS3 exclusive heavy rain is a controversial issue games
4414160	4417040	you hear about some of the nudity and heavy rain apparently I've seen some of the nudity
4417040	4422160	and haven't have any rain there yeah so it's alright I mean it's just you know just trying
4422160	4424920	to be a little bit movie ish well if you want to see it for yourself I don't know if you
4424920	4428400	get to see nudity in the demo but maybe you'll find out what this game is all about that'll
4428400	4433120	be on February 11th there will be a demo available on the PlayStation Network both in Europe
4433120	4438600	and North America that's February 11th not too far from now two chapters in the demo
4438600	4448080	one where you are the FBI agent Norman Jaden and then the other one I guess some type of
4448080	4456600	private investigator also lost planet 2 has a release date and some Gears of War characters
4456600	4460520	apparently are going to be making a cameo in the game as well that's kind of interesting
4460520	4465480	Marcus and Dom from Gears of War I'm guessing they'll be only on the 360 call it a hunch
4465480	4469200	yeah you're probably right there's some new trailers by the way on Xbox Live maybe they'll
4469200	4475720	have like may 18th by the way something like that from Uncharted or something in the ps3
4475720	4482400	one that'd be kind of neat yeah God of War that or Kratos that'd be kind of weird all
4482400	4489960	right apparently for the live folks our stream dropped while we were doing some of the reporting
4489960	4494760	right there I don't know why that happened but apparently it fixed itself I didn't have
4494760	4499480	to do anything weird I was just reading right on through the news apparently our stream
4499480	4505760	drops somewhere in there all right just another wonderful night here all right good times
4505760	4510520	hopefully just a hiccup in the cable not anything about our new software I hope anyhow let's
4510520	4513880	hope we get through the rest of the show dark soccer what do you got for us we'll make it
4513880	4520160	through the show so for more Star Trek online news since we did go into it just a little
4520160	4527760	bit in the last part they're actually doing a patch for launch day I patched it when we
4527760	4533320	were starting the show so for for the well no wonder we're dropping for you know I'm
4533320	4542880	kidding but they're already working on the first big update for the game they're not
4542880	4549280	really saying exactly what but there's gonna be more PvP exploration missions for the Klingons
4549280	4557620	and more ground-based fleet stuff as in huge ass quest like there's gonna be raids and
4557620	4565480	also also Rob they're thinking about having Q and time travel oh that's kind of cool yep
4565480	4570840	and yeah about seven of nine actually because I pre-ordered mine I'm gonna have a liberated
4570840	4576240	Borg cool I ordered my through Amazon so yeah I'll pretty much have my seven of nine just
4576240	4581080	not you know pretty um but like I was saying they're also doing rating there'll be five
4581080	4587480	man missions for max level players that will be both for Federation and Klingon and they'll
4587480	4595800	be that says will be released every few weeks starting a week after launch there's also
4595800	4601600	Federation versus Federation PvP which will be kind of interesting I guess I did I want
4601600	4605360	the mirror verse stuff to come in and you know down the line we're supposed to be getting
4605360	4614160	Cardassian and Romulan factions as well so I guess you have for the Federation then you
4614160	4622200	have Qapla you know for the Klingons sorry anyway um so yeah Darwinia is our next news
4622200	4635440	and it should be coming out on Xbox Live on February 10th and it's supposed to be free
4635440	4645580	on February 10th from what I understand and then $15 I think you have to pay for the minimum
4645580	4651520	sales I think later on if I'm reading this correctly and then another good thing is afterburner
4651520	4660280	climax will be coming to the US and actually into Europe for the spring on it says it's
4660280	4668680	going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and it's basically going to be the
4668680	4676920	full arcade port it's pretty cool now where's my planet Harrier you'll have to wait for
4676920	4683120	that I guess all right let's get into some Twitter topics although my mouth is full here
4683120	4688160	so I'm gonna have Loki answer the first one here oh actually oh here's a question from
4688160	4693200	Blue Swim and no theme music tonight guys sorry I didn't queue it up Blue Swim says
4693200	4697060	have any of you played Mercenaries 2 it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto meets Earth
4697060	4704220	Defense Force 2017 it's a ton of fun it is a very glitchy ass game yes I've played lots
4704220	4713260	of Mercenaries 2 and yeah it's horribly glitchy which is why I love it I've unfortunately
4713260	4718400	stopped playing it a long time ago though yeah I don't recommend picking it up if you
4718400	4725480	can find it used it's probably dirt cheap nowadays and yes it brings you back to driver
4725480	4733240	3 it is seriously hilarious just to watch like the computer do stupid shit TigerCloth305
4733240	4737720	on the Twitter sends us a story about a woman who loses 112 pounds links us to a story here
4737720	4744140	on Kotaku a 38 year old British woman apparently so big she didn't want to have sex with her
4744140	4749840	husband she was and I you know it's it's sad but unfortunately some of those images they
4749840	4754000	put out on TV about you know what the perfect woman looks like quote unquote you know it
4754000	4761120	causes this to happen to some people where she wasn't even wanting to it didn't even
4761120	4765040	feel comfortable enough to show her husband you know what I mean so anyway apparently
4765040	4770000	she lost 112 pounds all thanks to we fit her name is Laura Roberts and she came out and
4770000	4776540	said she went from 252 pounds down to 140 in a year and by the way though they do say
4776540	4780560	there was a dietary part of this as well and I think that's always important to know we
4780560	4783240	talk about these games that help you lose weight and everything you're not going to
4783240	4786920	magically lose weight just by playing one of these games five minutes a day you have
4786920	4791200	to make a I believe Jamie's used this term before on the show and I like it a lifestyle
4791200	4797120	adjustment yes because you have to make better choices in eating as well and you have to
4797120	4801120	you know do the game on a somewhat regular basis for a somewhat extended period of time
4801120	4805840	for this to work it just has to it's a lot of changes you know I'm even wanting to get
4805840	4811760	our DDR night started back again the tab the news of the world apparently said she ditched
4811760	4816280	the comfort eating and that added up to 4000 calories a day well of course she lost weight
4816280	4820960	yeah well and we fit just helped her probably tone it as she was losing it so it didn't
4820960	4824600	all kind of come out of one place you know well I've learned this and I've learned it
4824600	4829240	the hard way during this week and last one thing that's a big help now you know I've
4829240	4833760	had some stomach problems and I haven't been able to eat a whole lot I found out that if
4833760	4838700	you just eat until you're you're not hungry not full but not hungry because I've had to
4838700	4844920	stop there to keep myself from feeling sick I lost five pounds in a week it's just that
4844920	4849280	easy you know so she had the right idea you cut out the comfort eating you realize you
4849280	4853720	know what it is that you're doing it for and you know you can enjoy your food that's the
4853720	4859400	point but you know it is fuel first and foremost all right Ray Iannami on the Twitter sends
4859400	4865520	us a tweet death smiles will get a US localization by axis games they're the ones that make blast
4865520	4869600	blue and yes I remember that I'm on the list for last week the show that didn't happen
4869600	4875660	did I say I always say blast blue because there's no extra e well am I just wrong yes
4875660	4881080	you're wrong fine blaze blue looks like blast blue to me all right well anyhow death smiles
4881080	4888560	has five different characters apparently you explore the ice palace and it's a shmup by
4888560	4893400	the way of course you get to choose your own path and difficulty from a level of one to
4893400	4900020	three if I guess it customizes how many bullets you're gonna fight and all this save and play
4900020	4904200	back your own replays and there's online rankings and online co-op so this looks to be a pretty
4904200	4910320	robust little shmup and it's not something on Xbox Live it's a full disc release so looks
4910320	4914560	to be pretty intense and I know Ray is a big fan of the shmups so he's probably got his
4914560	4919560	eye on this one and lastly from SSJ 100 Matt on Twitter saying although his Twitter name
4919560	4924560	is Matt Osterovski and I always mispronounce his last name sorry Courtney love now says
4924560	4930560	that Kurt Cobain would have liked Guitar Hero 5 bitch be trippin she must have been paid
4930560	4934680	off wouldn't yeah apparently wouldn't she gonna sue him and now she says he would have
4934680	4941780	been cool with it this is by the way to the UK's NME magazine she says what pisses me
4941780	4945680	off the most about it is I think Kurt would have been fine with having five Kurt Cobains
4945680	4948740	singing the Spice Girls song wannabe like tell me what you want what you really really
4948740	4952540	want I think you'd find that really funny but at the same time it's gross what they
4952540	4959120	did Gwen Stefani started the lawsuit I have really good lawyers now will join that lawsuit
4959120	4962400	there was this gray area and they fucked a lot of us they didn't fuck Jack White but
4962400	4967120	they fuck Gwen fuck Johnny Cash and fuck Kurt it's just gross oh that's that's that's a
4967120	4971080	pretty impressive tracker there it's just gross this is a rock and roll business is
4971080	4976240	what people do they are sleazy they do sleazy things interesting I the quote I really pull
4976240	4981560	from this there was this gray area and if you go way back to when we first covered these
4981560	4987040	stories they didn't read the contract they were signed in and they probably had that
4987040	4991460	whole thing misrepresented there was fault on both sides one side didn't read it the
4991460	4995560	other side didn't represent it accurately I bet you that's what it is there's always
4995560	5003480	three sides to every star story your side my side and the truth so anyhow let's get
5003480	5010320	back into some other gaming news Loki what you got for us well I got some more information
5010320	5016720	regarding the Microsoft game room this is not really a big surprise to me but apparently
5016720	5021860	your classic Xbox Live arcade games won't work with the game room so for example if
5021860	5028120	you bought Frogger or you know even some of the Konami games that they had on there like
5028120	5034320	time pilot and whatnot you will not be able to play those games in game room you'll have
5034320	5041740	to purchase them again and mainly they're saying that some of those you know were revamped
5041740	5048200	versions on you know Xbox Live and honestly I think some of them weren't but you know
5048200	5054800	they're just probably they have licensing and the revamps like especially when you look
5054800	5060320	at some of those Konami games like Frogger and stuff new graphics that's it like some
5060320	5065280	some redone sprites there are more colors and stuff that's really it it's a little
5065280	5071260	shady but we kind of knew it was coming you know what I mean we kind of knew it was coming
5071260	5074920	that there was you know not gonna be or that you were gonna get screwed you'd have to buy
5074920	5080720	all these things over again I mean this isn't a surprise it's disappointing but whatever
5080720	5083700	I know you know they're gonna come out and say you know a because of the redone stuff
5083700	5088340	and these separate achievements and the leaderboards that are unique to the games and the fact
5088340	5093920	that in game room you can play them on the PC if you pay a certain amount and that I'm
5093920	5097800	sure they have reasons up the yin yang but just in the end you know you do feel a little
5097800	5101960	bit disappointed but at the same time did Nintendo let you download something on Virtual
5101960	5108580	Console for free just because you own the cart no so no surprise yeah but I mean this
5108580	5115120	is like the same you know online service it's just I don't I I I've bought a lot of those
5115120	5119720	earlier because I do love classic games and I bought a lot of I bought like Russian attack
5119720	5124760	I bought all these games I barely even were familiar with and I'll if I want them in game
5124760	5129080	room I'll probably have to buy them again but I'm just not going to on principle yeah
5129080	5133000	and that's that's where I stand I'll buy some of these like the Atari mate well I don't
5133000	5137060	even know because some of those Atari games I have to but depending on what game room
5137060	5141880	will give me with these classic games you know if there are things like robust leaderboards
5141880	5147160	and medals and things I might consider spying some of those really really good Activision
5147160	5151080	games that I would play over and over again like the original pitfall I still love that
5151080	5158840	game and would play that a lot I would they need to fix the d-pad that's really what that's
5158840	5162600	why I plan on buying everything on the computer too because it's the whole laptop and with
5162600	5168840	me on the go and everything so cuz it's a d-pad Microsoft come on it would be nice make
5168840	5173760	a revision to your controller maybe 3 surprise who knows they did it for a little bit in
5173760	5178800	Europe they release that green FIFA controller they're like we're done with it was a limited
5178800	5183640	time Brad from pop culture in our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com asks sky what
5183640	5189240	if they were to do some sort of bundle a discount for the XBL and game room at the same time
5189240	5194160	I'd be all for it I guess but the problem is is that I already bought the Xbox Live
5194160	5198320	version so I don't know if I would get access to the bundle I don't know if you mean like
5198320	5203480	maybe like a discounted game room game because I have the Xbox Live version of course I would
5203480	5211660	like that idea a lot but it's not gonna happen but I will refuse on principle I am not rebuying
5211660	5216800	Frogger I'm not rebuying joust I'm not rebuying anything that I already have on Xbox Live
5216800	5221240	Arcade which is quite a bit so Konami probably won't be buying much of your stuff unless
5221240	5226760	you really dig deep you have to put out like time pilot 83 some of these things that you
5226760	5231680	miss the first time and the other thing too about game room that they announced too is
5231680	5238360	that it's not going to be including any T or M rated content it's gonna be e10 plus
5238360	5246440	only so you know one of the games that they're talking about no death race 2000 unfortunately
5246440	5249880	oh that's right because I was rated really there I don't think there was that many T
5249880	5255000	and M rated game will be well hell most of the games weren't even rated back then I think
5255000	5259160	so actually all the games weren't rated back do they all have to be rerated they have to
5259160	5262920	be not even rerated they have to be rated for the first time well you know what I mean
5262920	5267640	though or do they just kind of roll up into game I don't know I don't know unless they
5267640	5271020	came out like the 90s and stuff where they finally started doing that well here's the
5271020	5275640	thing and a lot of people are saying oh this means no Mortal Kombat or Smash TV or dah
5275640	5281320	dah dah and I'm thinking you guys are thinking too new like I don't I think game room is
5281320	5288040	for really old stuff like you got to go back before the NES like you look at that initial
5288040	5295540	list of games that's coming out they are all really old games like Atari 2600 Intellivision
5295540	5299880	and arcade games of that era I think if you're sitting there going oh this means no Smash
5299880	5305040	TV you're thinking too new believe it or not I mean I know that sounds really weird to
5305040	5310600	say because Smash TV is probably a good 18 years old of a game right now maybe maybe
5310600	5317720	even 20 years old I think the games you're going to be seeing in game room are like 25
5317720	5327920	years or more old like before the great video game crash of 84 we'll see though I could
5327920	5332060	be wrong and who knows as you know game rooms supposedly going to deliver a thousand games
5332060	5337040	although I think there's going to be certain fudging of that number I think they'll give
5337040	5341480	us a thousand games but that means Crystal Castles on the Atari Crystal Castles in the
5341480	5347040	arcade Crystal Castles on the television Crystal Ca- there'll be ways they mess with that just
5347040	5353520	you see game guru says games before the NES kind of sucked um no there were a lot of great
5353520	5358100	games back in the day it's just by today's standards the short attention span that today's
5358100	5361680	gamers have I don't think would appreciate a lot of those old games from the past like
5361680	5367900	a very very simple game like kaboom roll the paddle back and forth collect bombs that fall
5367900	5371880	disgustingly simple game I bet most people that grew up on today's games would play for
5371880	5379680	about five seconds and go boring I could sit there and play kaboom for a while I mean it's
5379680	5382880	just you just have to kind of think about games differently arcade games were just different
5382880	5387840	back then they were they were one trick ponies look at the game the games that they released
5387840	5400600	on the Atari 2600 boxing freeway drag race you know they were very like one name things
5400600	5405720	so it was just different amiga 777 asked was tempest really fun yeah it was actually it
5405720	5410480	was a great shooter I think it's still really fun today especially tempest 2000 it's great
5410480	5415560	tempest 2000 is the shit anyway all right let's move on uh sorry uh some other gaming
5415560	5421820	news trying not to focus on the past too much here whoops uh monster hunter frontier this
5421820	5427240	is a new game between capcom and microsoft it's going to be coming out on the xbox 360
5427240	5433200	here's the deal apparently it's a port of a pc mmo that's right it's an mmo coming to
5433200	5438360	the 360 a monster hunter there is a little trailer that was released and capcom put out
5438360	5443660	a few details this week apparently the way the subscription plan will work you get what's
5443660	5448920	called a hunter life course coupon for about 15 bucks and you get access to the game for
5448920	5456360	30 days and you get an xbox live gold subscription with that for that month kind of interesting
5456360	5461480	yeah how much is xbox live a month anyway it's five bucks is it yeah so interesting
5461480	5465400	i wonder if you could buy like for those of us that bought xbox live for a year what happens
5465400	5469840	if you just want to buy like a few months of uh this game so let's keep adding it to
5469840	5474360	your year because you can store up to like five years worth of live well that's a little
5474360	5479920	ridiculous and also just a forewarning it's really hard to cancel once you've put your
5479920	5486480	credit card in there to pay it auto renews by the way yes it does and it's a pain in
5486480	5490120	the ass and you have to call them up and then they give you because i was paying for some
5490120	5497680	of our other co-workers you know just to have their accounts going and uh now they've left
5497680	5504200	kind of hard to get rid of the account especially when i'm paying for it all right uh reading
5504200	5507840	some comments from chat there's still some comments from the last story uh going on here
5507840	5512080	about game room vid power says i discovered the joys of atari 2600 when a friend brought
5512080	5515960	over his system a few years ago that's awesome oh man that'd be so much fun to just whip
5515960	5520040	out the atari 2600 and play that for a few hours uh game guru says i mean there were
5520040	5523680	some good games from before the crash but most were already ported to the xbox live
5523680	5528960	arcade for the most part i think there's still some good ones out there uh salacious pop
5528960	5534560	and chat says uh when the 2600 came out people were omg-ing that they could alter what happened
5534560	5538960	on their tv screen they moved the paddle and the dot moved very true why do you think those
5538960	5544600	pong they had machines that were only pong it was pong for your tv and that was it that
5544600	5550440	was like before the odyssey which was before the 2600 and those things still sold because
5550440	5555400	exactly right people were ooh-ing and ah-ing because they controlled what was on the screen
5555400	5560120	and that was really a first think about it television before that you don't control what's
5560120	5567320	on the screen besides you know changing the channel which doesn't really count so anyhow
5567320	5570680	sorry for the tangent there but those are some good comments around the room from chat
5570680	5574320	what's the tangent what's the show if there's no tangent what is the show without a tangent
5574320	5581960	how about doctor who speaking of tangents well um bbc um is uh pretty interested in
5581960	5587760	doing video games um for after the doctor who relaunched and they want to do um ones
5587760	5594080	that are complementary to each other instead of competition so i guess it's going to be
5594080	5600420	episodic that's how i would translate that or have uh you know things that go from one
5600420	5608400	to the other like transferable content um but they're saying that their ideas um involve
5608400	5613600	quote boxed product console games virtual worlds and other experiences so who knows
5613600	5619960	maybe we'll get a doctor who mmo but all the time lords are dead random question out of
5619960	5624520	the blue um wasn't there like a doctor who game on the dfs that was kind of it was top
5624520	5630980	trumps huh top trumps is like playing war with cards only you pick a stat and then the
5630980	5637120	other person picks a stat and whichever stat wins you take that card so sort of you play
5637120	5642200	kind of for anti but not interesting so it wasn't a very robust kind of game but i was
5642200	5646400	just thinking a fun way to pass time i'm hearing this story and i'm thinking well there was
5646400	5652240	a doctor who game but it sounds like it wasn't very dr hooey buddy rob overseas sent me yeah
5652240	5655320	that's what i thought i seem to remember you got a copy of it from an overseas listener
5655320	5660200	and we're playing it yeah no don't get me wrong i liked it it was pretty fun even though
5660200	5664360	it had martha all over it and i don't like martha but um season three doctor who just
5664360	5669900	was really weak to me but um i it was a fun game it's just it wasn't like super engaging
5669900	5677520	is what i'm saying it's not depth of story or anything that adds to you know to the the
5677520	5683840	universe uh decipher in chat says an mmo would suck everyone's a time lord time traveling
5683840	5689400	would be hectic and uh sj100 matt wins the chat by saying president cat is a time lord
5689400	5694240	president cat is a time lord that would be actually that would be the sequel to president
5694240	5701800	cat that would be the sequel to president cat time lord cat or lord cat instead of president
5701800	5706840	cat queen cat or something i don't forget it and for the record to tell our dear friend
5706840	5715600	brad from pod culture in the chat room martha was so she didn't get good until she was off
5715600	5721080	of the show i'll put it that way as a character she didn't get good until she was off of the
5721080	5728880	show she was this silly little girl with a crush and yeah she's smart she really couldn't
5728880	5733700	think her way out of the paper bag when it came to common sense sorry but it's all about
5733700	5743600	donna loud obnoxious and smarter than she thinks no and i'm not going to go into the
5743600	5748760	whole rose doctor fandom i was gonna say i'm sitting here going okay i don't know much
5748760	5755560	about dr who but i seem to recall rose was a big you were a big fan of rose rose eventually
5755560	5762480	though became for me the the little touch of mary sue i want to say you know you know
5762480	5768320	what a mary sue is right okay she took on a little bit too many of this not not to say
5768320	5771640	not to say that she was a bad character i loved her she was very well fleshed out she
5771640	5777200	and the doctor were believable together but there were certain elements that just seemed
5777200	5782040	like an okay we're doing this for the fans but even so rose was still amazing but i still
5782040	5789300	think that donna well my favorite of all the companions is um sarah jane to this day even
5789300	5793560	back to her old episodes including the badly written arc in space with the bubble wrap
5793560	5798160	larva creatures they really they made the creatures out of green bar uh bubble wrap
5798160	5806120	i low budget doctor who no it's what little i've seen of it i've liked i just haven't
5806120	5810280	committed the time to sit down and watch more episodes don donna is fantastic amazing especially
5810280	5817200	as dr donna all right back to video games loki so you may remember we talked about this
5817200	5822640	a few weeks ago that detail was pissed off at microsoft for locking out their third-party
5822640	5827480	memory cards which kind of sucks because microsoft memory cards are only like half a meg or not
5827480	5835400	even half a half a gig and um they really they're like 49.99 you mean for that price
5835400	5839040	you might as well just buy a hard drive because it's going to cost you about you know 50 bucks
5839040	5847340	more but you get you know like 40 times the space anyways so now um microsoft has registered
5847340	5854180	a motion to dismiss the antitrust lawsuit which was filed by daytail and um basically
5854180	5862800	they're citing that you know other um rivals like apple for example have a lockout on different
5862800	5868680	things for their systems for example can't run osx on computers not made by apple um
5868680	5874160	so why should you be able to you know use non-microsoft memory cards on your xbox i
5874160	5880440	think it's a little different but whatever um they're also claiming though that they
5880440	5887100	don't want to kind of um undermine the quality of the user experience on xbox live by allowing
5887100	5894160	data to release uh cheat enabling memory cards but from what i remember i don't think the
5894160	5898360	memory cards that they had were cheat enabling it was basically just allowing you to run
5898360	5902260	more space or you know have more space on there like instead of having a half a gig
5902260	5908760	memory card you have an eight gig memory card which is way cheaper um so i don't know if
5908760	5912400	it's really the same thing but yeah i can understand where detail you know they do release
5912400	5918680	a lot of their cheat devices and stuff for different consoles i don't think it's fair
5918680	5922080	it's an interesting comparison but what do you think is ultimately going to happen do
5922080	5928040	you think uh microsoft's got a point or do you think uh details gonna win i don't think
5928040	5935840	detail is gonna win because it's i think it's you know it's their system but then again
5935840	5942560	you know they don't they may they should i think that they should allow them to maybe
5942560	5946000	manufacture third-party hard drives or something like that because you know as far as their
5946000	5950600	storage goes they're really limited on what they allow other vendors to do it's basically
5950600	5958520	just you know either wired controllers or actually i think that's about it is all that
5958520	5963760	they have is wired controllers out there um you know storage is all first party you know
5963760	5967960	the network adapters i guess those can be anybody since that just plugs into the ethernet
5967960	5972600	port there's nothing really locking that out but um you know storage is a big thing and
5972600	5977300	i think they're way overcharging on their storage because you can buy hard drives that
5977300	5981980	fit in those actual cases because it all really is a laptop drive inside a fancy little case
5981980	5986280	that's about it and i mean the laptop drives are a lot cheaper than what they're selling
5986280	5991640	them for so you know that is kind of a ripoff but in the in the end it's their system i
5991640	5995120	guess so they can decide what they want to do with it there are ways around everything
5995120	6001720	but i don't know all right i'm surprised detail didn't find a way to kind of hack those things
6001720	6006680	but i guess it's not possible with hardware they tried i think but um yeah it's kind of
6006680	6009360	hard to do that with a memory card but can you imagine though if you could make a memory
6009360	6014120	card the size of one of those hard drives that'd be awesome all right let's move on
6014120	6019520	to some other news involving microsoft and it is the indie games uh indie games uh some
6019520	6024280	of the sales figures for 2009 were released and the best selling game xbox live indie
6024280	6029160	game was i made a game with zombies in it with all the elite speak in the title was
6029160	6038320	the best selling indie game last year um apparently uh it sold 160 000 units at one dollar each
6038320	6045200	that means 112 000 for ska studios that made the game not bad but uh unfortunately that's
6045200	6050240	just kind of one success story out of a lot a lot of games that are released which uh
6050240	6053720	i don't know i'm not here i haven't heard a whole lot about how those games are selling
6053720	6058160	there but i know it's very hard to kind of get featured in there and everything um there
6058160	6064440	is actually a more more uh full list of data here apparently uh rumble massage was the
6064440	6072120	sixth best selling game that just basically turned your thing into a massager let's see
6072120	6080600	what were some of the other big uh selling games of the year um avatar drop sold 117
6080600	6088000	000 with 433 000 doing a trial that was a dollar uh let's see number 15 the impossible
6088000	6095320	game moved 31 000 copies so that's at number 15 aquarium hd was number 10 24 000 copies
6095320	6103200	172 000 trials interesting sorry guys snake 3d or snake 360 is nowhere to be found is
6103200	6109400	a meyer dig deep on there uh no neither's neither's revenge of the ball oh no minor
6109400	6113520	dig deep is there sorry number five it just doesn't have actual figures but yeah that's
6113520	6120840	a pretty good game yeah it's addictive so there you go if you haven't checked out any
6120840	6125320	games go go download there's so much there's some good stuff i think they really under
6125320	6130240	advertise it i mean there's a ton of stuff on there and it's really hard to sort through
6130240	6134440	it because of the new interface which was supposed to be a good thing and i don't like
6134440	6141140	it so anyhow uh i think this is the part of the show where we're gonna get into some emails
6141140	6145200	although i don't know if we really have a lot of emails i think i heard there was one
6145200	6149360	left over from last week that never got read i had remember i had to um delete all the
6149360	6154520	spam and i think i got rid of some of them whoops so if someone um sent us email just
6154520	6159760	uh resend it to to me and i'll redo it all right so we don't have email this week yet
6159760	6165120	wow well i'll play the music and then end it because we have no emails so send us your
6165120	6169260	emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com obviously if you send them tonight you're
6169260	6173480	too late but do give us some emails for next week we'll be happy to take your questions
6173480	6178040	and uh hopefully after the oopsies and whoops of the past couple weeks we can get back on
6178040	6183380	track with some more listener interaction um so maybe the lack of emails uh due to spammers
6183380	6188720	necessitates an f you f the spammers i hate spammers they hit our website too but i've
6188720	6194620	gotten creative like they keep spamming this thing on the forum about how to turn sub video
6194620	6199280	on your ipod all this crap what i did is i put in a custom filter that turns the name
6199280	6204700	of the program into this program fucking sucks so every time they uh put a spam post it just
6204700	6209040	puts a link to this program fucking sucks so and i'm going to continue to do that for
6209040	6212960	all the programs that they spam on the board because it's funny even if it doesn't get
6212960	6216520	them to stop it's really funny that they're taking all this effort to announce to the
6216520	6221160	world that their program and they always use like names like i'm a stupid spammer oh yeah
6221160	6226280	i did that too oh sorry yeah i change i put in custom filters and say punch me i'm a stupid
6226280	6230960	spammer i'm like if you have okay i thought they were doing that i was like no why would
6230960	6238360	you do that no i see but it's funny that people are thinking that if you can't beat them fuck
6238360	6242400	with them you should just change all the words that they use like like hot dog and like stuff
6242400	6247080	they just make it weird well i can't change a lot like i can't change ipod because maybe
6247080	6253280	people on the olr forums want to have a legitimate discussion about ipod but this shut up but
6253280	6256920	this particular company ain't no one give a shit about them so i'm just going to change
6256920	6262880	it too and you know i think i think the language is how to convert video i think i that whole
6262880	6267360	if you use those words just like that it changes to punch me i'm a fucking spammer or something
6267360	6274120	like that it's great oh i like that idea um somebody changed their name to this program
6274120	6279960	fucking sucks in chat change them all to breastler quotes i'm gonna do that the next okay you
6279960	6284720	got it the next one i see i'm gonna change it to say guy guy guy guy guy guy guy and
6284720	6293520	then the best the best the best i'll do it i'll do it you wait in fact oh man spammers
6293520	6315760	hit our forums right now so i can mess with you guys even more hey f us
6315760	6324480	or soccer i want to start us off tonight um i being busy f you to be busy that's about
6324480	6330760	it loki fe adobe programs are being too complicated i mean seriously an adobe premiere to try
6330760	6337180	to render something so that it actually plays back correctly is like pulling out my hair
6337180	6340960	i mean i understand that they want to be flexible with what kind of options and stuff but when
6340960	6346160	i try to render a video and like the audio is all lagged out and or it's like at the
6346160	6353080	wrong resolution or it's just like an audio file i'm like god damn it just have a button
6353080	6358400	where i click it and it okay look windows media file done you know select the resolution
6358400	6364000	done you know i have a program that converts um you know different video files for use
6364000	6371400	with my uh playstation 3 so you know that one they either have you know the uber you
6371400	6377440	know okay i just all the settings type stuff or you can just do the stupid simple i want
6377440	6383960	it to look good i want it to have good sound you just select you know good very good excellent
6383960	6388560	you know that type of stuff so why they can't do that is beyond me i have to actually cut
6388560	6393240	you know create my own custom settings and save that profile so that i have to actually
6393240	6398800	have one that works really frustrated and i know auditions the same way because it's
6398800	6405080	hard photoshop good did you say photoshop sucked earlier in the show no i said photoshop's
6405080	6410920	good i said photoshop on the iphone probably okay sorry uh let's see my fu of the week
6410920	6415600	goes to actually you know for a lot of things are going very very well for me so i can't
6415600	6421720	complain but just fu to that chaos feeling that and like uncertainty like you know things
6421720	6427320	are changing but you don't know how they're changing and just the whole process of moving
6427320	6432520	i hate packing and having to throw away things i don't need the fact that i'm having to downsize
6432520	6441160	from a house to an apartment again sucks but i'll get through it i always do all right
6441160	6446040	couple more stories for you guys and then the skype line and hopefully very few audio
6446040	6451960	problems tonight but we'll see what happens uh low-key what you got for us uh let's see
6451960	6459360	what we've got um it's funny the last story um it's actually a new game coming to the
6459360	6466960	nintendo we it's uh from mist walker and um apparently the uh other game that we we talked
6466960	6470620	about this earlier this is on that list of titles that were like to be announced and
6470620	6477320	whatnot um xenoblade was the other one that's actually a game coming from um the company
6477320	6484800	let's see here oh it's actually the localized name for uh mondan was it monado uh beginning
6484800	6490240	of the world which is an rpg from monolith soft and then of course the last story is
6490240	6496200	an rpg um game being developed by mist walker and uh they didn't really say what it is but
6496200	6502000	it's a new new form of rpg they're calling it so whatever the hell that's supposed to
6502000	6508000	mean um and yeah and then the other thing of course metroid uh other m you know it's
6508000	6512400	supposed to be coming out summer 2010 in japan and what do all these have in common all of
6512400	6517880	them have teaser sites now on nintendo's japanese website so you can go check those out as well
6517880	6522440	um so that's kind of neat so obviously they're coming relatively soon if they have their
6522440	6530840	own teaser site all right there's been a lot of nintendo news tonight it's all kind of
6530840	6534720	tying it together i guess so i think i don't know i think nintendo's trying to put the
6534720	6539080	cards together to really try to wow us again at e3 this year but i just on their hardware
6539080	6544200	i don't know but mist walker had some pretty good rpgs at least lost odyssey blue dragon
6544200	6549900	was kind of for me i mean it wasn't great but i know jamie really enjoyed it so i guess
6549900	6553440	they got some people with it anyhow i have one more story for you guys then we're going
6553440	6557820	to open up the skype line this has to do with steam and some of the growth that steam had
6557820	6566280	in the year 2009 apparently 25 million users now on steam that's a 205 jump over the year
6566280	6570080	and year sales and i wonder if this takes into account some of the uh christmas sales
6570080	6574160	because they were having some obscene sales at the end of the year there um and valve
6574160	6577400	put out a press release earlier in the week just talking about how great their 2009 was
6577400	6584360	uh more than 25 new accounts meaning they're up to 25 million uh 10 million of those actually
6584360	6589800	using profiles on steam over a thousand games available on the service 100 different developers
6589800	6596240	um just crazy five years i guess the service is being being used now uh they hit their
6596240	6601480	peak in december 2.5 million concurrent users probably thanks to modern warfare 2 and left
6601480	6608760	for dead 2 uh monthly average player minutes 13 billion so uh those saying the digital
6608760	6614520	distribution didn't have a chance yeah uh steam's proving a lot of those wrong and i
6614520	6621040	think again it's a lot of those just obscene uh sales that they have on steam that really
6621040	6625960	kind of pushes that up to the top and the fact that valves you know pretty uh respectable
6625960	6629920	name in gaming you know the half-life games of course and you know portal and and team
6629920	6633440	fortress and all that and all this that good stuff that was in the orange box you know
6633440	6640560	and the fact that that software came with those games which were big pc games so i would
6640560	6644440	be curious though i know this isn't going to really involve digital distribution on
6644440	6650800	a wide scale but i'm curious how the new blizzard net software is gonna i don't want to say
6650800	6654960	necessarily compete with steam but kind of like put a chunk in that whole concurrent
6654960	6658860	users and stuff because you know let's face it i realize steam might have a hundred different
6658860	6665280	developers but blizzard is like they're like kings of pc development between wow diablo
6665280	6669480	starcraft it's kind of hard to ignore the fact that blizzard is a behemoth and it's
6669480	6673840	going to be interesting they're a three trick pony happen yeah it's good well well apparently
6673840	6676960	they're working on a new ip that we don't know about yet four trick pony it's going
6676960	6684040	to be interesting to see you know what happens well has blizzard made a bad game yes chirp
6684040	6690320	chirp chirp maybe the viking game but even that was kind of neat so i don't know we'll
6690320	6693360	see well i'm just kind of yeah i think in the end they're not really competition because
6693360	6697600	i don't see blizzard really selling all these different types of games but blizzard net
6697600	6703140	they already digitally distribute their own games and that's not to be ignored that's
6703140	6709920	a huge chunk of pc market right there so uh isam says and digital distribution is tax
6709920	6713900	free as no physical materials exchanging hands to boot crazy i don't know if you guys done
6713900	6717400	your taxes though but you know on the tax thing you're supposed to report anything you
6717400	6723320	bought that was out of state to uh yeah i don't think so yeah right yeah prove they
6723320	6727140	bought it out of state i would you know i think if maybe i bought a car out of state
6727140	6731560	or like major purchases i'd probably report those because you know that's the ethical
6731560	6736000	thing to do and i don't want to get caught but like 20 bucks on a game i can't keep track
6736000	6739880	of that throughout the year come on if you want to charge me taxes on it you need to
6739880	6745480	do it at the point of sale like some other states do so all right and by the way some
6745480	6750160	folks in chat saying uh lost vikings is good rock and roll racing for this nest was by
6750160	6754360	blizzard that was from vid power and gang guru and rob d says hey if that was the only
6754360	6760040	one that wasn't a good game uh blizzard's in good shape i agree there you go so uh all
6760040	6764280	right you guys ready to get to the skype line at uh one eight seven seven game olr our username
6764280	6768360	on skype is orange lounge radio again i don't know how this is going to work tonight i'm
6768360	6774000	hoping the audio program uh audio problems are okay we don't have a lot of them our phone
6774000	6777960	call with bobby went okay so hopefully skype goes okay too we have a call on the line hi
6777960	6783600	you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is ray hi ray how are you doing i'm all
6783600	6787560	right what's on your mind tonight i've been meaning to call about this for a few weeks
6787560	6793600	now but haven't been able to because missed episodes because you know yeah yeah anyways
6793600	6800280	we had some drama what's up um dg max technical platinum crew service is finally online like
6800280	6804300	internationally not just in a few countries that's right because you can download it now
6804300	6813160	on uh the psn right uh no i'm talking about the server the online service for arcade dg
6813160	6819180	max technical machines oh oh okay okay gotcha yeah so for those who haven't heard of it
6819180	6826320	it's kind of like konami's emu system only it actually happened outside of japan and
6826320	6832680	what it what you can do is like go to the special mode where you can do these missions
6832680	6839120	to unlock new charts and songs there's also some like special super hard charts you can
6839120	6846400	try as well as some courses you can do where you can compete for the best score and then
6846400	6851040	when you go online on your pc or your iphone or whatever you can check your scores and
6851040	6857160	whatnot um is this really taken off in arcades though because you know it would seem like
6857160	6861880	this is kind of an expensive thing for arcades to set up are they actually kind of welcoming
6861880	6870400	of this um so far i think so like when like the first week i was there like there are
6870400	6875920	pretty huge lines for the technical machine like at sanibel golf fund like as many as
6875920	6881400	10 to 15 people wasn't it really in mind i can understand like the excitement for it
6881400	6889840	and such um okay well i i just i don't know i just think about like arcades and it's unfortunate
6889840	6893320	because i think about i haven't really been to an arcade myself in a long time and i'm
6893320	6897520	a pretty hardcore gamer and it's i i hope there's more interesting things like this
6897520	6902400	that bring me back i i almost wonder if our local arcade has this all set up it's kind
6902400	6908440	of sad how arcades outside japan are doing i mean there i believe a number of factors
6908440	6913500	and it's like for example arcades on maintaining their machines or american arcade developers
6913500	6917820	not taking the arcade scene seriously like choosing to make novelty games rather than
6917820	6926040	games that you can play for quite a while like rostral for example a lot of their games
6926040	6930960	are the kind of games that you would play just from novelty like a few times not really
6930960	6938560	take seriously hmm well uh speaking of which um of this whole dj max thing um because i
6938560	6942440	i referenced this a minute ago but now it's available on playstation network you know
6942440	6946840	to download right to your psp what do you think that would be dj max fever and i've
6946840	6953520	heard they fix a few things but i'm still like i'm not still like getting it because
6953520	6958520	there's one annoying feature that they didn't take out that would have made me buy it and
6958520	6966440	that's the author correct feature hmm uh i'm looking in chat ssj100 man on our chat says
6966440	6969920	uh they had this whole system set up at eight on the break that's that popular arcade in
6969920	6975960	jersey and it was an hour wait to play yeah that sounds like wow spiggle too wow i should
6975960	6979560	check and see if uh the roseville golf land here got it i don't even know i haven't been
6979560	6984360	there in six months kind of too bad well all right well uh ray is there anything else you
6984360	6989520	want to um ask us about tonight yeah not the moment all right well thanks for calling and
6989520	6993040	giving us the update it's it's it's good to know what's going on in the arcades because
6993040	6997920	it's some sad irony that uh loki myself and dark sakura all met at an arcade yet we hardly
6997920	7005560	ever go anymore yeah unfortunate i brought the arcade home uh main cabinet loki unfortunately
7005560	7009920	a lot of people did that's the problem a lot of people brought the arcade home i mean street
7009920	7015720	fighter 4 hello arcade and oh home hey all right ray you take care buddy yes sir speaking
7015720	7020560	which i actually bought some stuff to upgrade my arcade cabinet at home i bought a new uh
7020560	7024800	g force graphics card because now i'm gonna because i before i had what they call an arcade
7024800	7030600	vga card it's basically a hacked ati card that's pretty old um with some different drivers
7030600	7037520	and stuff but you can do the same uh 15 you know drivers hey be quiet loki's talking um
7037520	7042800	to output to the arcade monitor with uh software and you can run any card with that so now
7042800	7049360	i can run you know hopefully uh since uh man alive here blaze blues uh continuum shift
7049360	7054000	uh leaked to the internet i'm gonna run that on my um cabinet too clearly we have a caller
7054000	7060280	on the line hi who's there uh legend is aku hi zaku how are you doing yeah i just want
7060280	7066280	to say congratulate you on the new year i managed to make a good uh almost like what

7082160	7089400	don't remind me well what's on your mind uh nothing much just wanted to let me see the
7089400	7094120	truth of the matter is uh you heard about the ipad right and how some of them are just
7094120	7100680	like wait wait wait wait what's an ipad no i'm kidding i'm sorry yeah yes we heard about
7100680	7105640	the ipad i mean the way i see it right now i don't know i don't know why they had to
7105640	7111360	make the the ipod i mean the ipod touch or iphone much bigger i guess it's because apple's
7111360	7118240	trying to try to make itself relevant against the ds and the psp trying to carve itself
7118240	7124840	an itch in that in that gaming market when it's like a johnny come lately right now uh-huh
7124840	7129180	i mean i don't know some of them were just saying the other day that it might actually
7129180	7136500	be a game for sony actually picked this one up on kotaku earlier today where the the ipad
7136500	7142800	itself would actually increase do you type with your fists like the clacking of the keys
7142800	7147920	is so loud it's my mac all right oh okay that explains it all right never mind okay that
7147920	7153080	explains it is it just me it sounds like he's beating the keyboard with his fist but let's
7153080	7159040	like they have because these are the chicklet uh keys they look exactly like that but let
7159040	7166200	me see uh yeah sony's please as much with apple's ipad something along that lines let's
7166200	7173900	see you see nintendo basically uh you know a lot basically panning the the ipad i don't
7173900	7176640	know when you joined the show we covered that in part a towards the top of the show yeah
7176640	7179760	we talked about a wada base basically saying what the rest of us were thinking that the
7179760	7185160	ipad is basically uh several eye touches glued together well it's basically the point where
7185160	7189960	steve jobs literally jumped the shark and just trying to go after going trying to go
7189960	7196000	after everything when he's not you know i mean i can understand that the i the iphone
7196000	7200560	and the ipod touch managed to build itself up to a gaming platform even though it was
7200560	7206720	never its true intention well here's the thing here's the thing the ipad only needed like
7206720	7212000	a couple of really great things and i think very clearly distinguishable things from the
7212000	7216640	iphone that would have made people jump all over it and i think one of them is if they
7216640	7222080	put a camera in the front of it so you could video conference from anywhere i think a lot
7222080	7225360	of people would have ate that shit up right away i think that would have been amazing
7225360	7230360	and i think the other thing is multitasking i mean they go out and say yippee skippy we've
7230360	7235480	got a gigahert processor in here but uh you can't really surf the web and that was a disappointment
7235480	7241640	yeah the only thing it's the only thing it is just a an oversized uh an oversized iphone
7241640	7246640	minus the the you know the voice sorry i like this comment from chat decipher says did jobs
7246640	7251400	give a thumbs up and say hey while jumping over this edge shark we'll imagine that he
7251400	7257040	did um since i know you're big on like the mobile gaming and everything do you think
7257040	7260760	the gaming is going to take off on this platform i mean we already heard about how it's going
7260760	7265520	to be able to play all the existing iphone games but you blow them up to scale or whatever
7265520	7269160	it should be backwards compatible with the you know the other ones but then you have
7269160	7275120	to realize some other you saw you saw that actual you know the day they actually revealed
7275120	7279960	the ipad and he had like uh i think it was game loft that had the first person shooter
7279960	7285200	tech demo that they had up there and it looked it looked pretty damn good for for something
7285200	7289040	that you know something that small but zack do you think there's going to be a lot of
7289040	7293480	people that are that excited about the ipad where developers are going to be jumping to
7293480	7297680	the bit to develop it depends on how much of an install base we're talking about with
7297680	7302680	the ipad whether or not the ipad itself would would have the same numbers as the ipod touching
7302680	7307160	the iphone if there's a huge install base and that's a that's a pretty big market to
7307160	7311540	actually you know make games on and the other thing is developers have to take advantage
7311540	7316160	of the platform completely they can't just like glue they can't just mickey mouse their
7316160	7323720	way onto the onto like um you know onto that platform when you know shitty titles they
7323720	7332560	have to really find a way to to exploit the to exploit the the platform's potential you
7332560	7337640	know there's a lot of strengths in that platform in terms of you know multi-touch in in the
7337640	7344080	accelerometer so surely they could think of something that could utilize both if not all
7344080	7350400	the aspects of the the device you know i think though it's important to remember that apple
7350400	7355280	loves to reinvent their shit and i think honestly i think in a year's time i think the ipad's
7355280	7360400	going to get a lot better let's not forget good god he's like he's shooting a gun at
7360400	7366320	his keyboard um it sounds like whack-a-mole it does it sounds like you have a chuck-e-cheese
7366320	7371360	there alright and here's the thing i think in a year's time when that thing is redeveloped
7371360	7375380	it's gonna be great because let's not forget the iphone did not have the app store when
7375380	7380120	it first launched right and that was and that was like several months and that was basically
7380120	7385840	steve jobs coming to a census and realizing that you can't just have a you can't just
7385840	7390600	have everything web-based when that whole web-based platform is basically it's a bottleneck
7390600	7395960	all right it's not it's not it's not a robust solution for what you could actually do natively
7395960	7400960	All right, Zaku, we're gonna let you go so you can go play more whack-a-mole, but thanks for the call, okay?
7400960	7401960	All right, have a good one.
7401960	7403960	Type a little bit more for us so we can hear it a little more.
7407960	7408960	Bye, Zaku.
7412960	7421960	We need to have like a loudest keyboard competition here at Orange Lounge Radio in honor of the new soundboard helping us with alleviating the Jamie typing during the show noises.
7421960	7424960	We need to have a loudest keyboard competition.
7425960	7426960	I don't type that loudly.
7426960	7428960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7429960	7430960	It's Brad from Pod Culture.
7430960	7436960	Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. Wait, hold that thought for a minute. You're right, Jamie. You don't type with your fists, but you have to admit.
7437960	7439960	Okay, Brad, what's up? How you doing?
7439960	7441960	I'm doing fine, guys.
7442960	7444960	What's on your mind?
7445960	7447960	Star Trek Online, man.
7447960	7453960	Oh, Star Trek Online. I know you've been all over this game. Congratulations on having a computer good enough to play it, for starters.
7455960	7459960	The computer itself isn't that old, or isn't that high-end.
7460960	7463960	A lot of RAM and a video card that was donated to us.
7464960	7468960	It's the video card. The video card is so key, I think, for this game, and well, any game, really.
7468960	7472960	But tell us a little bit about your experiences with Star Trek Online. How's it been going for you?
7473960	7475960	When I can log in, it's great.
7475960	7487960	I guess with the beta and stuff, I've had some problems at first logging in and staying in, and then they had one huge, almost a gig patch that seemed to smooth everything out.
7488960	7489960	That took forever, didn't it?
7490960	7491960	No, kidding.
7492960	7495960	Also, were you there for when the beta closed?
7496960	7498960	Oh, yeah. I was on the Starbase getting my ass kicked by Borg.
7499960	7500960	Okay, so how cool was it?
7500960	7507960	It was ridiculously cool, because it was hopeless. There's nothing you could do to win.
7508960	7510960	Did the Borg come out and say, you will die?
7511960	7517960	When you hear the Borg, though, you actually hear the big mass voice of them talking. It's pretty cool.
7518960	7522960	Yeah, the first training mission with the older Borg was pretty damn cool.
7523960	7526960	So that's how they ended the beta? They just had a big Borg invasion?
7527960	7527960	Yep.
7527960	7533960	Oh, it was Borg clinging on every damn race attack, and it was awesome.
7534960	7537960	Nice. That sounds very Ragnarok of the developers to do.
7538960	7540960	It was kind of a geek Ragnarok, yeah.
7541960	7548960	In Ragnarok, they used to just do random raids on the town by all the critters.
7549960	7553960	So, did you go ahead and remake your character?
7554960	7555960	Oh, yeah.
7555960	7556960	I'm doing that tonight.
7557960	7558960	I'm almost back to where I was.
7559960	7560960	Oh my gosh, that's impressive.
7561960	7563960	I'm totally going to have a character permanently living on DS9. I don't care.
7564960	7569960	During the beta, I flew my ship out there, and it looks pretty damn slick.
7570960	7571960	No quirk!
7572960	7574960	It's, what, 38 years or something like that?
7575960	7576960	He still needs to make money.
7577960	7579960	He's got his own moon now, and his brother's the Nagus.
7579960	7586960	You've got to wait for the expansion. There's going to be an inevitable expansion pack, and that's where the fan service will really start getting delivered.
7587960	7588960	They'll put Khan. You'll be able to fight Khan or something.
7589960	7592960	No, he's probably long since... He died, Rob!
7593960	7594960	This is Star Trek Online in the alternate universe, though?
7595960	7595960	No.
7596960	7606960	It takes place from that point, the big event where the two universes split, it goes forward from our prime timeline forward.
7606960	7608960	Now I've gone cross-eyed.
7609960	7614960	It'll do that. I will say, this is the first game that's actually got me to play an MMO.
7615960	7616960	I quit World of Warcraft for this.
7617960	7619960	Well, this is better. It's Star Trek.
7620960	7625960	Except I totally, totally hate the targeting system.
7625960	7635960	More like ship navigation in combat. Or the fact that having never really played much in PC gaming, period, if I just suck, which I do.
7636960	7641960	No, it's not you. It's just the control, and the walking controls are oversensitive.
7642960	7643960	A little bit, yeah.
7644960	7646960	Yeah, I mean, it's really easy to run into a wall.
7646960	7657960	Well, Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun on Star Trek Online. I know there's been talk about an OLR fleet, but since I'm not really playing the game until I get a better computer, that's gonna be all Jamie to put together.
7658960	7662960	Her OLRian race and all that, so Jamie, you're gonna have to get on the forums and tell people how to join up with you.
7663960	7664960	Screw that, I'm playing a trill.
7665960	7666960	Whatever.
7667960	7668960	Well, he did say join up.
7669960	7674960	I tried to make a couple of OLRians. They're not very orange, although I did make a really cool chick.
7674960	7685960	I'll tell you what, I'll put up some of my experimental pictures in the chatroom of some of the things that I've made, because I saved screen caps, and, you know, people, this is what I want you to do.
7686960	7696960	If anyone wants to contribute to the OLRians, I want pictures of your creation screen with the face dimensions, with what you've done to make one.
7697960	7698960	Okay, there you go.
7698960	7704960	Hopefully we'll get some forum chat. Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun with Star Trek Online. Hopefully I'll be joining you in a few months.
7705960	7710960	I want to ask you real quick, though, because I know you're a big fan of this, too, and one of your other shows is about Dollhouse.
7711960	7715960	If I'm not mistaken, Dollhouse had its final episode this past week. How was it?
7715960	7730960	It was a different kind of episode. It was almost a sequel to the season one ender, Epitaph One, and it was pretty good. It was pretty good overall.
7733960	7742960	It's one of those things that you could tell that they had a rush. The last few episodes, actually, they crammed like two seasons' worth into four episodes.
7742960	7748960	That's too bad. Any word about what Joss Whedon is up to next, besides directing an episode of Glee, apparently?
7749960	7757960	Well, apparently he's got battered wife syndrome or something because he's in talks with FX, which is pretty much Fox, about doing something.
7758960	7761960	And then, of course, there's always Dr. Horrible, too.
7762960	7768960	Oh, Dr. Horrible, too. Excellent, excellent. All right, well, Brad, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for your call, okay?
7768960	7772960	All righty, guys. Have fun, and the new board is sounding really good.
7773960	7776960	Thank you so much. We're happy to have it. Now, if only we could get all the computer stuff side-fixed, but we'll get it.
7777960	7778960	All right, later, Brad.
7779960	7779960	Later, guys.
7780960	7789960	Podculture.net if you want to hear more of Brad and his sci-fi geekdom. And if you liked our little Doctor Who talk earlier, or I should say Dark Soccer's little Doctor Who talk earlier, that's Brad's show.
7789960	7797960	That's where they live there. They'll debate whether Tenth Doctor was better or Fourth Doctor was better. They'll debate that all day long.
7798960	7808960	By the way, one thing to mention, if anyone else is playing Star Trek Online, you can add me to your friends list. I'm in there as Dark Sakura with the space in between the two on the Star Trek Online page.
7809960	7811960	All right, we got another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7812960	7814960	Good evening, you across the ocean.
7815960	7816960	How are you, my friend?
7816960	7823960	This is Aguerefer, as well as new, well, new listeners. What the fuck? I will help.
7824960	7825960	Oh, well. Anyway, good evening.
7826960	7826960	Good evening.
7827960	7837960	Or good morning, if you are to be incorrect or something on these parts, since actually it's like, yeah, it's like half past five.
7838960	7839960	It's five in the morning where you are?
7840960	7841960	Yeah, it's 5.35.
7841960	7846960	Easy. I feel so bad we weren't able to do the early show, but, you know, shit happens. What can we do?
7846960	7871960	No, no, no. The thing is that, well, yeah, I was almost about to actually miss it since I was about to go, I was just shaking around, and then I found, oh, yeah, this whole show is like now, but I haven't slept that much, so, oh, well, what the hell? I'll see if it happens, but it didn't, so, well.
7871960	7875960	Well, what's on your mind tonight, Aguerefer?
7876960	7882960	Well, Mass Effect 2 is an awesome game.
7883960	7894960	Of course. We haven't mentioned anything about Mass Effect 2, but that was a huge release this week. I know it's been getting a lot of, like, especially folks that just loved the first one are all about this game. Tell us a little bit about your experience with Mass Effect 2.
7894960	7923960	I've, well, I, well, what can I say? I'm an impatient fuck, so to say. I should really be, like, and I'm, and I'm, like, in a kind of way, almost, but still not doing that since, well, the whole story is that I got the, cracked the, got the pirated version of it, and played it all through, and now, and,
7924960	7933960	then I tried to install my retail copy, and my retail copy will not work for some strange reason.
7934960	7951960	But, here's the other thing, is that, well, since I'm still running the Windows 7 beta, which runs out of time pretty soon, I'm not that, it doesn't annoy me that much, so to say.
7951960	7961960	Well, how is Mass Effect, because I'm not as up and up on Mass Effect. I watched a friend play it once for a little while, and, you know, obviously I've heard it's a BioWare RPG, it's awesome.
7962960	7967960	How does it, what are some of the differences between 1 and 2, or is it really just, like, a continuation of one story?
7967960	7994960	No, no, the whole really difference between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 is really, the combat is way much better. Way, way much better, since, well, it annoys me really at first, because, well, I'm not, because basically they, I felt like they turned, like, Mass Effect into Gears of War.
7994960	8009960	Which is, well, you run for cover, and, well, you shoot from cover, and that was a mechanic that I didn't at first like, really, at all.
8009960	8038960	But, well, after a while I got used to it, and then I've just been reminded, yeah, what's the difference between this and Gears of War? Well, here you actually have a health bar, or shield meters, and you can actually rush people, kill them up front, and in Mass Effect 2, I don't die after that.
8039960	8042960	I die after, like, five minutes.
8043960	8052960	Well, good, because I'm totally the type of bonsai kind of player where I just run out, ah! I'm not very good with covering that, so, excellent.
8053960	8059960	Well, IK Ripper, I want to wrap up real quick and get to some other calls, but quickly, what are some other games you're looking forward to in the next couple weeks?
8060960	8062960	Bioshock 2.
8063960	8064960	Oh, another great one.
8064960	8073960	Yeah, but, these, and that's the, really, that's the only game I have room for in my budget.
8074960	8085960	But, here's the other thing, is that, well, for both Mass Effect 2 and Bioshock 2, I've went and got the collector's one.
8085960	8101960	And, especially the Bioshock one is really interesting, because you get, the soundtrack that you get in the special one is the record, that authentic record, apparently.
8101960	8115960	Which is, like, that's, like, one, a few nerd bonuses from me, which makes it, like, insta-buy. So, I will.
8116960	8121960	Alright. Well, IK Ripper, I gotta let you go to get some more calls, but have fun with your collector's edition, enjoy.
8122960	8123960	Yeah, later.
8123960	8131960	And thanks for staying up, or getting up earlier, staying up late, now you know he's staying up late, to listen to the program, it's an awesome commitment for you guys overseas.
8132960	8133960	Love it.
8134960	8143960	Why not? We can do some more calls. 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I'm just having fun hearing some of these people through the new computer,
8144960	8150960	because now that we kind of had to reconfigure our sound, it's actually helping the calls a lot. I'm actually kind of impressed.
8150960	8155960	We should have done this, like, three years ago. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8156960	8157960	Hey, this is XLink.
8158960	8159960	Hey XLink, how you doing?
8160960	8161960	Hey, doing good. I have a few things I'd like to talk about real quick.
8162960	8163960	Well, I suppose.
8164960	8172960	The iPad, the only good thing I can see about that is maybe playing desktop version of D&D, making it more better, enhancing it a little bit.
8173960	8177960	That's the only cool thing I could possibly see ever coming out of that thing for $500.
8177960	8184960	Funny enough, another giant, I mean, not a tablet so much, but that table, the Surface, I remember a story we had a couple months ago,
8185960	8193960	maybe like last month, about a big D&D game that was on the Surface, I know was supposed to be kind of really innovative for that platform,
8194960	8198960	so that's an interesting way of thinking, is the iPad as a D&D device. I could see that.
8198960	8207960	Correct. Mass Effect had a big patch about two months ago for the first game that they took a lot of the issues that they were having,
8208960	8212960	like in the screens where there was dialogue, where it was spoken, a lot of times it was skipped.
8213960	8219960	They cleared a lot of that up, which was really helpful, and made the gameplay a lot better, a lot more smooth than it was before.
8219960	8227960	And then Mass Effect 2, I'm hearing, they took a lot of the gameplay and a lot of the stuff for the experience,
8228960	8233960	when you level up a character, and made the interface more easier than it was beforehand.
8234960	8236960	So that was very interesting.
8237960	8240960	I'm going to have to check these games out at some point. There's too many games to play, especially now.
8241960	8245960	Usually we're not saying this in January, February, it's just insane what the release calendar looks like.
8245960	8248960	I'm starting to wonder what's left for Christmas.
8249960	8253960	Really, well it's hard for me because I work, and then I do my online schooling,
8254960	8259960	and then between that and trying to level my character in a while still, it's kind of hard to go back and forth.
8260960	8267960	I just now got to nine hours of Mass Effect 1 for the PC, which I'm really enjoying a lot.
8268960	8272960	Didn't you, weren't you telling me on Warcraft that you bought that on some Steam sale or something?
8272960	8276960	No, I bought a few other things on Steam, but that wasn't one of them.
8277960	8282960	Actually, I bought that one at a store for $15, $10 when it was sale.
8283960	8283960	Nice.
8284960	8287960	Yeah, it was a real good value for it, but I can't remember what I bought.
8288960	8291960	Now I'm going to go back and try to remind myself what I bought last from Steam.
8292960	8294960	But it's been a while since I bought something from there.
8295960	8299960	Usually I get most of my stuff while it was on sale during that Christmas stuff, during Christmas time.
8299960	8303960	But I have a question for Loki though.
8304960	8308960	I was planning on trying down the road here getting an Xbox 360.
8309960	8311960	Which system would be the best for my value?
8312960	8316960	They're all about the same because it's really just what size hard drive you want.
8317960	8321960	So probably just, I don't know, an Elite.
8322960	8323960	Delete?
8324960	8325960	Yeah, because then you get a hard drive with it at least.
8326960	8326960	Gotcha.
8326960	8330960	Yeah, I don't get the arcade because you're somebody like you who actually plays a lot of games.
8331960	8332960	You're going to want a hard drive.
8333960	8335960	So make sure you get at least the Pro that comes with the 60 game.
8336960	8337960	Stay on the Pro, it's just the Elite now.
8338960	8339960	Oh, it's just the Elite and the Core now?
8340960	8341960	Then you need to just get the Elite I think.
8342960	8345960	The arcade is good for replacing a dead 360, which is what I just did.
8346960	8347960	Or people that really don't play console games a lot.
8348960	8350960	But if you're going to play your games, you know, think about it.
8350960	8355960	If you get an arcade unit and you want to play 1 versus 100, you have no place to store the game.
8356960	8357960	Because you have to download it from the server.
8358960	8359960	So you're going to need a hard drive.
8360960	8361960	And by the way, it's very interesting.
8362960	8365960	I mean, something that I don't hear enough people question.
8366960	8371960	A lot of folks really gave Sony hell over the price of their console.
8372960	8375960	But Sony didn't nickel and dime you the way Microsoft's doing.
8375960	8379960	I mean, yeah, Microsoft got their system out for what? $199.
8380960	8381960	But without the $100 hard drive.
8382960	8383960	Without the more expensive component cable.
8384960	8386960	Without any type of wireless adapter built in.
8387960	8389960	They don't put the component cable in with the Sony systems either.
8390960	8391960	Okay, fair enough. I'll give you that one.
8392960	8395960	But without a wireless adapter, where Sony has that built in, yes.
8396960	8397960	And Microsoft wants $100 for theirs.
8398960	8399960	But some people don't need that, so why pay the extra money for it?
8400960	8401960	I'm just saying, it's not brought up enough.
8401960	8404960	What's the value you're getting?
8405960	8407960	Especially now that the PS3 is $299.
8408960	8410960	They're about equal now, I think.
8411960	8412960	So, something to think about. Anyway, sorry.
8413960	8415960	Really quickly, I'll let you go.
8416960	8418960	The battle that you were asking about.
8419960	8423960	I actually own a copy of Warcraft 3 with the expansion.
8424960	8426960	And the funny thing about that is, when I registered that onto it,
8426960	8430960	I can now download that anytime I want through them.
8431960	8435960	Which is good, because if I ever lose a disc, or the disc gets lost when I move from place to place,
8436960	8440960	or if it gets broken or something, it's good enough to know that I can log on to that site
8441960	8443960	and redownload the game and not worry about, you know,
8444960	8449960	have to go out and spend another $30, $40, or $20, or whatever, to replace the game.
8450960	8453960	Absolutely. I'm trying to find my old Diablo 2 key for the same reason,
8453960	8455960	because I want to play that again and I know I can download it,
8456960	8459960	but I can't find my old CD. The game's just so frickin' old.
8460960	8463960	But what's cool about it, if you put the CD key into the battle.net,
8464960	8467960	it will not only appear on your screen like it does with Warcraft and everything,
8468960	8469960	but also it will let you download it.
8470960	8473960	Like, if you click on the game, you can download the game onto your computer.
8474960	8475960	Very cool.
8476960	8479960	Excellent. We're going to wrap up and let you go so we can try and squeeze a couple more calls in,
8480960	8481960	but thank you so much, okay?
8481960	8485960	Take care, buddy. 877-GAME-OLR. Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8486960	8489960	We'll see if any more calls come in, but I'll let Loki start some last minute news.
8490960	8491960	Alright.
8492960	8494960	I'm assuming Jamie doesn't have anything, but I don't know if you have anything, Jamie.
8495960	8496960	Way to assume, Rob.
8497960	8498960	I'm just saying.
8499960	8502960	There's more Who coming to the Rock Band Marketplace.
8503960	8506960	Apparently some more tracks are going to be coming on February 7th,
8507960	8508960	according to an advertisement.
8508960	8510960	It looks like...
8511960	8512960	Oh, that's in Rock Band?
8513960	8516960	I don't know. It's some digital advertisement, but that's kind of neat.
8517960	8519960	We got another call coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8520960	8521960	Hey, it's Sturlock.
8522960	8523960	Hi, Sturlock. What's on your mind?
8524960	8529960	Not much. I wanted to let you guys know about something cool I found a few weeks ago.
8530960	8531960	We like cool stuff. What's up?
8531960	8537960	Well, I remember the FC Mobile, which was the portable NES.
8538960	8540960	Yes, I do. I got that as a Christmas present, which was amazing.
8541960	8542960	I have one too.
8543960	8545960	Well, now there is a portable Super Nintendo.
8546960	8547960	It's done by a really crappy company.
8548960	8552960	Yeah, it kind of is, but it's not that bad.
8553960	8556960	Does this mean the patents are up on the Super Nintendo technology or something,
8557960	8559960	where now we're going to start seeing all these bootleg Super Nintendos come out?
8559960	8562960	I guess so. I guess we're going to be seeing more of these.
8563960	8566960	So maybe this is the first one out the gate, but that means there might be some more of these in the future.
8567960	8571960	Well, tell us a little more about the system, because even though Jamie's heard of it, I have not.
8572960	8574960	Well, it's called the FC 16 GO.
8575960	8585960	And yeah, it's done by Yobo, who did the FC Twin and the FC3, and I don't know, they're not the greatest.
8585960	8592960	But the Super Nintendo end seems to be kind of improved in this.
8593960	8599960	It does play Star Fox. Oh my gosh. Nice. Wow.
8600960	8606960	My only real complaint about it is the headphone jack is retarded.
8606960	8614960	Like, the headphone jack is not your standard, you know, three and a half millimeter, you know, whatever.
8615960	8620960	It's 2.5, which is, you know, like what you would see like in a cell phone headset.
8621960	8626960	That's weird. Do you think that might be a region thing, because cell phones are so prevalent in the other countries, maybe where this is really...
8627960	8631960	I don't. I mean, I solved that problem. I just got an adapter and that was that.
8631960	8635960	That's what RadioShacks are really good for. I need an adapter.
8636960	8640960	Yeah, exactly. But yeah, I haven't found anything that doesn't work on it.
8641960	8642960	Well, that's pretty cool.
8643960	8646960	I guess Super Mario RPG probably doesn't work, I don't know, because I don't have the game.
8647960	8656960	Is it the same type of thing like the FC Mobile, where, you know, it's kind of like you can have it on, you know, a little portable system, or you can hook it into the TV and do it that way?
8656960	8660960	Yep, it is. And it comes with two wireless controllers also.
8661960	8662960	Oh, wow.
8663960	8664960	And the controllers are actually pretty good.
8665960	8669960	I'm very excited at the idea, because Super Nintendo, I'm sorry, is the best console they ever put out ever.
8670960	8672960	I don't think they'll ever put out a console that good ever again.
8673960	8678960	Just being able to play some of these games like Kid Icarus, or not Kid Icarus, I was going to say Super Metroid.
8678960	8686960	Yeah, Super Metroid. I wish the hypothetical Super Nintendo Kid Icarus game in my head, and Actraiser, and Final Fantasy III, VI, whatever you want to call it.
8687960	8688960	Which does work on it.
8689960	8690960	I'm still going to go with the PC Engine Duo.
8691960	8692960	What's that?
8693960	8694960	That was released in the US, so I have no memories of that.
8695960	8696960	Sorry, it's got some of the best games ever.
8697960	8701960	Yeah, Dracula X, which was kind of a bastardized rondo of blood, pretty much.
8702960	8704960	Alright. Well, Sturlock, anything else on your mind, buddy?
8705960	8706960	No, that was it.
8706960	8710960	Alright, well thank you so much for the call, and have fun with that FC16 device.
8711960	8712960	Yeah, it's pretty fun.
8713960	8715960	I'm going to look into it, but I'm going to wait and see what kind of competition comes out. We'll see.
8716960	8717960	Yeah, I'm sure there will be other things.
8718960	8719960	Alright, take care, buddy.
8720960	8720960	See ya.
8721960	8724960	GameGuru says, expect the FC64 to come soon. Who knows?
8725960	8733960	It sounds like it's about, what, 20 years on the patents or something? I don't know exactly how that all works, but it's going to be interesting when the ones on the PlayStation and so forth are up.
8733960	8735960	I'm really curious to see what happens there.
8736960	8741960	Decipher in chat says, I want a portable N64 so bad. Go buy a Nintendo DS.
8742960	8742960	Seriously?
8743960	8746960	That's what they pretty much are. Loki, do you have any other last minute stories while we see if any other calls come in?
8747960	8748960	Um, yeah. Let's see.
8749960	8751960	Oh, we got a call coming in. Hold on.
8752960	8754960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8755960	8756960	Hello, it's Salacious Pop.
8757960	8757960	Hi, how are you?
8758960	8759960	I'm good, how are you?
8759960	8766960	I'm great. For those listeners that don't know, Salacious Pop, you know this show pretty well, right?
8767960	8768960	Yeah, I've been listening since about September.
8769960	8772960	Yeah, and is there any type of special relationship you have to this program?
8773960	8775960	Yeah, I might be going out with one of the hosts.
8776960	8777960	Get a room.
8778960	8780960	Yeah, Shermy and I, we just know.
8781960	8782960	It's kiddie love.
8783960	8785960	I know. Well, Shermy misses you terribly.
8786960	8787960	Alright. No, in all seriousness...
8787960	8788960	My brain's improving.
8789960	8794960	Salacious Pop is the said boyfriend I mentioned earlier that was supposed to be here last week, but sadly it didn't work.
8795960	8800960	Do you want to describe quickly, I don't know why you're calling tonight, but I'm just going to derail and ask you to talk about what I want to talk about.
8801960	8806960	Can you describe for the listeners what the scene was like in studio last week at 10am?
8807960	8813960	Lots of flapping hands and flailing. It was very chaotic and stressful.
8813960	8818960	I know, and you're probably just kind of watching, just like Shermy, kind of watching going, uh, what?
8819960	8828960	Yeah, it was my fault that I was there. I did 9-11, and I caused all that cancer, and then I set up the bomb for LLR.
8829960	8833960	So, to all the UK listeners, I'm sorry. My presence there sort of cursed the machine.
8834960	8835960	But they have a new system now.
8836960	8840960	I see. Alright, so what do we owe your phone call tonight?
8840960	8849960	Um, I was just being silly and wanted to say hello and say that I'm really looking forward to eventually being a guest.
8850960	8852960	Maybe this room will be less chaotic next time you're here.
8853960	8859960	Let's hope. I don't know, tonight was pretty bad. I mean, the only difference between what you saw and tonight is that we actually had a show tonight.
8860960	8861960	You've got a bigger mess in here now.
8862960	8863960	But there was lots of flailing.
8863960	8871960	Yes. There really was. Well, what about this week's news? I know you've got something to say about some of these topics going on here.
8872960	8873960	You were the one that gave me the Steam story.
8874960	8885960	Um, most of my internet trolling for news has involved just wank about the iPad, which I know that everyone's gone over about a million times on tonight's show.
8885960	8896960	But just that it's not very good. As a huge Half-Life fan, I was upset that Black Mesa Source was bumped until this year, but that's like a month-old story.
8897960	8902960	They were supposed to release their remake of Half-Life 1 by the end of last year, and it didn't happen.
8903960	8907960	I remember hearing something about that, and I remember you were kind of upset about that because I know you're a big Half-Life fan.
8908960	8910960	Whatever happened to Episode 3? That's the other big question, right?
8911960	8912960	Damn them!
8912960	8921960	It's probably going to be so big that they're just going to throw it into Half-Life 3 proper, but Valve is so silent on it, no one knows anything.
8922960	8924960	And it's been almost three years since Episode 2.
8925960	8930960	Are you going to be downloading Rondo of Blood when it comes to Virtual Console? Oh wait, you don't own a Wii.
8931960	8934960	Hypothetically, if you owned a Wii, would you download Rondo of Blood?
8934960	8941960	Well, I have the remake for PSP, which I heard is really good. It's sort of a competent remake of it, so I don't really need to.
8942960	8945960	And why don't you own a Wii? Because you have a 360 and a PS3.
8946960	8953960	Well, I put off buying the 360 and the PS3 because I wanted an HDTV, because they were made for HDTVs.
8953960	8967960	So now that I have the TV, and Wii is now standard def, the video file in me is offended by that, and I just don't want one. I don't know.
8968960	8969960	Nintendo's being ignorant?
8970960	8980960	Yeah, if they put out an HD one, or the Wii, whatever, Omega, in a year or two, the next gen, I would get that, but I'm sort of over standard definition.
8980960	8994960	So don't care that they're the only system you can do the new Super Mario Brothers, or Super Smash Brothers Melee, or this Metroid Other M, or the fancy Zelda games, but until it's pretty, no thank you.
8994960	9008960	I guess. I mean, it sounds really superficial, and I hate the fanboys on the forum to just say, oh, you know, the graphics, blah blah blah. It's all about the graphics.
9009960	9018960	But those franchises, I've visited those franchises so much, and I've played the previous incarnations of Zelda and Metroid, that I can just go to a friend's house.
9018960	9033960	It's not that important to me to get a system for those specific franchises, which is really all Nintendo is now. You have to be with Nintendo if you want the Zelda, whereas all the third party is with Sony and Microsoft.
9034960	9042960	Alright, well, you know that I have a Nintendo system, so you can come over and play Zelda or what have you if I choose to buy those games.
9042960	9051960	For the record, you guys are both invited, everyone in this room, including me, because I live here, and on the phone with us is invited for PC Engine Night.
9052960	9053960	When is PC Engine Night?
9054960	9054960	Sometime.
9055960	9060960	Maybe after Moving Chaos, we'll get Alan down here one week and we'll have PC Engine Night. It'll be fun.
9061960	9062960	Seriously, we'll get our Dracula X on.
9063960	9067960	Or bring PC Engine over to New Casa de Rob that'll be wired for video and everything.
9068960	9069960	If Dan doesn't crap his pants like he did last time.
9069960	9071960	Just steal it. Alright.
9072960	9079960	Nice. Alright, I should probably let you go. I hate to do that to you, but I'll talk to you later, you know that.
9080960	9080960	Yes.
9081960	9082960	Alright, you take care, and thanks for calling.
9083960	9084960	Alright, thank you, bye.
9085960	9094960	Alright, that's going to do it for the Sky for the Lion tonight. Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but hey, we need emails, so you should totally write us some emails if you didn't get through tonight. That would be awesome.
9094960	9100960	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. I'm going to let Loki wrap up with any other last minute stories and then we're going to wrap up the show. Loki.
9101960	9108960	The developer behind the Survivor Horror game that came out last summer, Cursed Mountain, has gone under.
9109960	9113960	Apparently they've run into some financial trouble.
9114960	9118960	Oh well. I got shut down. Too bad.
9118960	9134960	That's all I pretty much had. Oh, Dragon Quest stuff. Looks like 6 is going to have some new anti-piracy measures put in place on that cart, so it might be a little harder to crack.
9134960	9155960	And then also there's this one game that I'm playing now that's a homebrew game that's now available on, or I should say that it was a free game that was available now on Wii Homebrew, which is Saoban, which is Cat Mario, and it's extremely hard and funny because it's extremely hard.
9156960	9157960	Is that what you were giggling at during the Skype calls?
9158960	9162960	It's just really brutal, like the second level you're supposed to go into the warp pipe.
9162960	9173960	If you wonder why Loki doesn't talk much during the Skype segment unless you specifically call out his name, it's because that's the point of the show where he's catching up on all the funny stuff and you'll randomly just hear him, hee hee hee, over there in the corner.
9174960	9177960	He doesn't sound like that, but you know what I mean. He's laughing at something on the internet.
9178960	9183960	Alright. Is that it? That's all I... We are about out of here.
9184960	9187960	Well, we're going to wrap up the show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
9187960	9194960	But I do want to say before we get to the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio and checking us out and sticking with us through the good times and the bad.
9195960	9200960	I know it sucks that we haven't had any show the past couple weeks, but I'm looking at the live listening numbers and we haven't really tapered off.
9201960	9203960	We're still right back where we were, and so thank you guys for coming out.
9204960	9214960	I know especially the anticipation of us coming back tonight, and I hope the new sound was worth it, but at the same time, especially for those of you live folks that had to kind of put up with some of the hiccups we've had tonight,
9214960	9218960	that we'll probably continue on into our special live only after-birth segment after the show.
9219960	9225960	Thank you guys for sticking by us while we kind of go through all these changes.
9226960	9229960	But it's fun. It's a new year, a new decade of sound and everything.
9230960	9236960	So anyhow, and of course, if this is your first time listening to Orange Launch Radio, we are a non-profit show.
9237960	9240960	We're not really a business that's out to make money. We don't really run ads during the show.
9240960	9245960	All we ask, if you like the show, tell two friends about the show and help us spread the word. That's all we ask.
9246960	9250960	We're an independent production. We don't have a lot of big dollars behind us, and we're just here because we want to have fun.
9251960	9252960	That being said, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9253960	9255960	DarkSakura, I see you picking up the mic, so why don't you give us your final thought?
9256960	9258960	Um, yeah.
9259960	9260960	Loki, your final thought?
9261960	9265960	Hopefully that new YouTube video will be up this week.
9265960	9272960	My final thought is I totally want like a warm chocolate chip cookie right now. Sounds amazing.
9273960	9276960	Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show. We really appreciate it.
9277960	9283960	We'll be back here to do it all again next week. Hopefully the computer doesn't blow up or anything until then, but we'll pray that we're back.
9284960	9285960	Bye guys. Have a wonderful week.
