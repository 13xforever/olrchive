14032	25167	Tonight, January 31st, 2010, big Nintendo franchise games could be out this year, the classic Japanese release looks to be US-bound, and Ubisoft announces a controversial new DRM.
31701	34123	We are live, I think.
34663	37605	Welcome to another week, everybody, of Orange Lounge Radio.
38045	43869	We are that show dedicated to video gaming, video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43969	46670	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week.
46830	52114	And also joining me tonight, say hello to the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, or as we used to call her anyway.
52614	54495	The one and only, now she's an angry bunny.
54575	54995	No, I don't know.
55155	56376	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
56456	57097	I'm not angry.
57437	58658	No, she's a very pleasant bunny.
58898	59498	I'm not a bunny.
59518	60399	Contrary to rumors.
61800	62540	I'm not a bunny!
63521	64181	You're some bunny.
65662	69705	Alright, so, and also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
70126	70446	Hello.
70706	71367	Hi, how you doing?
71647	72067	Doing fine.
72127	74729	He proved he was the Techmaster tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
74809	76110	Okay, where the hell do we start?
76510	80773	Alright, obviously we've been without a show for two weeks, and that's not the place we like to be.
81434	88059	You guys knew this was coming, though, because a couple weeks ago we told you guys that there was not going to be an Orange Lounge Radio because I was going to be in Seattle.
88559	89059	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
113135	116936	So, unfortunately, we didn't end up having a show last week, and that kills.
117016	128659	We really hate missing two weeks in a row because we know a lot of people, you know, well, especially the fact that we know a lot of our British listeners were, you know, making plans to tune in, so we feel really bad that that didn't happen.
128679	131000	But, of course, you know, computer issues are computer issues.
131020	133661	There's not a lot we can do about it, so it didn't happen.
135142	137743	So, we had to replace the old computer, essentially.
138103	147889	Now, the nice thing is we already had a new computer waiting for us because, you might remember a couple years ago, or you might not, the listeners all pooled together and bought us a new computer.
148049	148889	Wasn't that long ago.
148989	150090	Well, maybe it was about a year ago.
150570	151511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
172611	174472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
199191	204375	A brand new mixing board that we just posted a picture of to our Twitter account.
204515	205256	And the website.
206717	208198	Oh, did you send it to the website too?
208318	208678	Yes.
208698	208778	Nice.
209018	210940	So it's also there on orangelauncher.com.
210960	213782	So if we do sound a little different, you can thank our new mixing board.
214062	218205	And supposedly our mixing board does all these effects I haven't even played with yet.
218285	221808	Like I think it does like equalizer effects.
221828	223149	Like I think if I hit that button...
223689	225170	I think my voice gets more bassy.
225370	227893	I don't know if anyone notices that, but there's like an onboard equalizer.
228213	230114	We just opened this out of the box tonight.
230335	230975	Let me turn that off.
231376	232717	I don't even know if that did anything at all.
233077	236080	But I think supposedly you can do these weird FX things too.
236140	237601	Like if I turn, let's see which one's me.
238221	238962	Turn that up.
239322	240423	This is all live radio.
240463	241044	It's all the fun.
241304	245027	I think if I turn that up, it actually does some type of delay effect.
245527	246989	I don't, it probably sounds stupid.
247069	247389	I don't know.
247689	248370	Let me turn that down.
248826	249707	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
264867	286330	moving on up moving on up all right so anyway it's great to be back we're really sorry we missed the past couple weeks but i think for some of these upgrades that we've had here in studio in a way it was almost worth it i can tell you the show computer is much better than it was before so um i'm excited and they said in chat they didn't hear the fx so all right so i'll have to play with the mixing board over there i don't know i was just kind of futzing around with it
287151	288572	I don't know what effect this is on right now.
301038	302239	DarkSakura, how is your gaming week?
319318	319978	Gaming Week?
321919	322360	I didn't.
322880	323300	Not really.
323400	329323	I mean, I played Star Trek Online, but I missed the end of the beta because I wanted to see all of the Borg going in and assimilating all the people in game.
330444	331745	I did see the video of it.
331765	333746	It was pretty funny.
335707	340369	Because the Borg took over Earth, or the Starbase outside of Earth, so it was pretty fun.
341750	346552	I got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom because I decided I did not want Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
347953	352175	I know, me not wanting a Silent Hill, but it wasn't really a Silent Hill, I don't think.
352355	353456	It was like a different kind of game.
354016	357818	So I have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which makes me a happy fangirl.
361959	365121	I read this really about it, I think.
366840	369324	Dan's been playing a crap ton of Borderlands as usual.
369985	372709	And I finished another season of DS9.
372949	375473	And it has nothing to do with playing games.
375933	376835	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
377155	377756	We did something.
378537	382123	We broke out the SNES and got our Super Metroid on.
383072	383673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
409033	409754	It's beautiful.
409814	411597	So hopefully Jamie's volume is a little better now.
411637	412178	Just let me know.
412519	414762	We'll play with things tonight as we go.
414802	417547	And I apologize because it's completely unprofessional, but you know what?
418288	418668	I don't care.
418749	419249	You know what?
419349	419710	I don't care.
419870	420271	You know what?
420351	421012	You know what?
422655	423356	There, that's what I say.
425467	425767	That's it.
454893	455634	I'm doing pretty good.
455674	459356	And then my true skill ranking as far as ranked deathmatch goes, I'm almost in the top 100.
459396	461717	I might be in the top 100 right now, I don't know.
462217	465159	But last I checked, I was like 104 or 105.
465639	469261	So that's pretty good out of like 50,000 people.
470142	475085	And then I've been playing Borderlands a lot, especially since I can...
475325	476466	Thank you for watching!
504665	523795	Yeah, and then as I was going to say, I know everybody's been bugging me about doing more videos for the YouTube channel, so finally I put the one video that I did a while back on the YouTube channel, so there's something there now, and there's a new one which I already previewed in studio at least the first three minutes of it.
523815	524956	I want to make it like ten minutes, but...
525396	526057	It's pretty funny.
526157	530381	A lot of these custom things that Loki always talks about on the show, you can now kind of see on the YouTube.
530401	530802	It's great.
530822	546378	Yes, it will document how I used to play Deathmatch and Grand Theft Auto, The Lost and Damned, a while back when we played with modded consoles and modded games and whatnot, our closed work games that we'd play.
546878	567281	but um you know it's hard to explain it so I just kind of have to show you so the first part of the video that I have done I finished this weekend um is basically showing the different weapons in the game and then the very end there's like some of the vehicles that you can use in there and then finally I'm going to get into the actual deathmatch stuff because I have like
567641	572145	I'm looking forward to seeing more of the YouTube's I didn't realize you'd already put one up
588154	589835	Yes, I did that yesterday.
618087	619008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
643968	644889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
670284	671065	That's really old.
671145	671865	Exactly.
672065	673466	I was pissed when I found that out.
673506	674806	But stupid me, my mistake.
675306	676007	Lesson learned.
676387	676887	Just so you know.
677087	679928	I got my computer the Christmas 2009 and I can run it.
682574	685976	Yeah, well, mine's from about 2008 because I think I bought it around August of 08.
686576	689637	So, you know, it's just a bummer, but lesson learned for next time.
689697	692999	So I might have to get a new computer later on down the line.
693519	695020	My gaming really didn't end there, though.
695400	703924	I didn't really play, but I watched God of War Collection this weekend, which included the God of War 3 demo.
704264	705525	God of War is kind of one of those games.
705565	706065	It's really weird.
706225	710727	I haven't played a lot of it myself, but I've watched several other people play this game.
711067	713210	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
732091	760124	I think the game really looks great and it's kind of one of those games I'm always sitting there going hmm I want to kind of pick this up and play it but for now I'll just watch my boyfriend play because he's having a lot of fun playing it which by the way can I just say this real quick why I'm really mad the show last week didn't happen is that he was a surprise special guest on the show last week he's really funny and knows his shit when it comes to games so I'm really disappointed it didn't work out but we're going to try to get him on a later show because I'm sure you guys are going to enjoy it
761905	766407	Let's see, what else have I been playing these past few weeks that is not WoW related?
766467	771750	Still some Xbox Live Arcade things, 1 versus 100, because I think the season's wrapping up pretty soon.
772210	773791	A little bit of Gyromancer, a little bit.
774212	778534	And Bejeweled Blitz, you know Bejeweled Blitz just got a major update on Facebook.
778894	781896	Now you collect coins to buy power-ups that you use.
782676	787119	I love PopCap, they make the best crack games in the world, it's great.
787879	790821	Anyhow, feel free to join our chatroom, guys, if you're listening live.
790861	797686	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
797846	800468	We start at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
800788	804730	We got a little bit of a late start tonight because of all the issues going on with our audio board.
804770	809333	In fact, I may have already said this whole spiel about All Games Radio, and if I did, I apologize.
810294	812895	I'm really scatterbrained tonight with all the stuff going on.
813495	816796	But now we can kind of coast into housekeeping and tonight's news.
817496	823637	I did want to say real quick during housekeeping, again, there was no show on the feed for the past two weeks.
823657	824297	There was nothing.
824357	832399	So this should be the first show that shows up, episode 353 after 352, which was taped, believe it or not, on the 10th of the month.
832479	835400	So we have missed you guys, as I know a lot of you have missed us.
835880	859851	and of course we have some fancy new toys and we're going to be playing with these over the next few weeks do bear with us though during tonight's show when we have a whole new setup we're more prone to technical difficulties so just give a shout out in chat if suddenly our audio drops or something really weird happens you don't hear us dead air our live listeners we really count on you guys to help us out chat.orangeloungeradio.com
860611	865954	Also, since I have been so focused on trying to make sure the show is starting by 6 o'clock, I haven't been posting a lot of tweets.
866614	869936	But go ahead and send in your Twitter topics if you have some stuff you want us to discuss tonight.
870276	872477	We'll be taking those at the top of Part B tonight.
872897	876599	And, of course, if you don't yet have us on Twitter, it's twitter.com slash OLR.
877059	879360	Or we're on Facebook, too, at Orange Lounge Radio.
879400	883022	And as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, finally showing the YouTube some love.
883342	886364	And that's YouTube Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio?
886524	887064	Orange Lounge Radio.
888479	889520	Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio
915874	917775	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
942823	947985	and apparently I think Xenoblade is a new RPG, I want to say.
949685	957648	And then they've got Super Mario Galaxy, which is due sometime in 2010, most likely probably around the holiday, be my guess.
958348	958928	And then...
960649	968971	Some other stuff I haven't heard of, there's a new Legend of Zelda that's to be announced, Lion Attack Heroes, which is something that they showed during E3.
971412	976153	Hoshino Kirby, Kirby game, that's also to be announced.
976233	978553	And start with 100 words, English conversation.
978934	982454	Most likely a game we probably won't see over here, because most of us speak English.
982895	984615	Maybe not that well, but we do speak it.
985315	991379	Um, and then Span, um, Smasher is another, uh, Wii game, which I remember, I think that was a WiiWare title.
991800	992380	Um, I can't remember.
993121	998464	And, um, looks like, uh, Kensa Kusu, also another to be announced title.
998504	1001986	And then Last Story, uh, which is, I believe, the new Mistwalker title.
1002947	1008591	Um, all those have been announced for, you know, sometime this year or to be announced.
1009211	1018213	And then, also, there's a promo video that says the new Zelda game, the one that is kind of to be announced, may be coming this year.
1018613	1035477	In fact, apparently, something that they're thinking is going to be shown off at E3, and my guess is probably yes, because they're going to need something to get people's attention after they show Wii Relax, because everybody's going to be like, Ugh!
1036458	1037558	Don't care!
1038958	1048503	I kind of get the impression, based on a lot of this, what you're saying, that Nintendo is really trying this year to really wow us at E3, where there's been a lot of disappointment in years past.
1048923	1051845	Not just these games we've talked about so far, but some other ones we're going to talk about in a minute.
1051885	1056207	It seems like there's a lot of core franchise news coming out of Nintendo.
1056307	1059708	With the exception of, well, no, even Mario is supposed to have Galaxy 2, right?
1060069	1060769	So you've got Galaxy 2, Zelda...
1063110	1066793	Metroid, I mean, a lot of their big franchises have games this year.
1066993	1067953	Well, so far.
1068133	1069254	I mean, dates change.
1069274	1070375	We're talking about the end of 2010.
1072076	1076039	Now, I mean, this stuff could all be pushed by the time we get to it.
1076219	1080281	Is it possible, though, that Nintendo has been working on the Zelda game in secret, quote-unquote?
1080301	1085805	I mean, you know, saying there's a new Zelda game is about as obvious as, you know, it might rain today, you know?
1086265	1086405	But...
1087786	1090207	Remember E3 last year?
1090648	1092969	The Mario game came out of nowhere.
1093229	1095510	And it ended up probably being the best Wii game of the year.
1095610	1097971	I don't doubt that they're working on a new Zelda game.
1098412	1105635	And the thing is, though, is I wouldn't expect it to probably be too different than Twilight Princess was because look at Mario Galaxy.
1105655	1108457	I mean, all they're really doing is crafting new levels to go with it.
1108497	1110998	It's basically going to be the same engine all over again.
1111018	1112319	I mean, no effort there.
1113100	1124732	Wasn't there a rumor, and I want to say it was on our show roll for last week, because sadly the show didn't happen, but we had a whole script and a whole thing ready to go, and I want to say one of the things was about that supposedly the new Zelda is supposed to be kind of like Majora's Mask.
1125112	1126994	It's supposed to be a sequel to Majora's Mask.
1127075	1134743	Which would make sense, because Majora's Mask was essentially Ocarina of Time with some new frills, because it was a new game.
1135069	1136671	I just, I don't know.
1137552	1146041	A lot of the stuff they see from Nintendo, and granted, Other M looks pretty awesome, but that's being kind of developed by a third party anyways, so whatever.
1146262	1149826	I just want to see Samus' booby mechanics, because it is Team Ninja after all.
1150306	1151926	So you know she's going to have some boobie mechanics.
1151986	1152766	It's going to be awesome.
1152807	1155687	Even though she wears a steel space suit or something.
1156387	1161328	I would rather see a lot of third-party companies work with Nintendo on some new games.
1161348	1166209	If that's what it's going to take to make these games stand out and be a little different.
1166789	1167829	I think that would be pretty cool.
1168749	1174650	Can you imagine a new Mario game with them working with Sonic Team or something like that?
1174670	1175031	Like the 3D...
1178031	1180233	Suddenly Mario is blue and has spiky hair.
1180313	1180873	It's incredible.
1180893	1186737	Well, it doesn't have to be exactly Sonic, but I'm just saying something like, you know, the Sonic Adventure stuff.
1186777	1188418	I mean, just, I don't know.
1188699	1192781	Or maybe revivals of some of the dead franchises that people really want to see come back.
1192821	1194943	Like, oh, I don't know, Kid Icarus, maybe?
1195883	1196344	Just a hunch.
1197017	1197617	We need Pit.
1198117	1198598	Exactly.
1198638	1199918	Whatever happened to that rumor?
1200238	1202859	There was artwork and all this shit that came out for the game?
1203419	1205140	And then it just... What?
1205440	1207681	Well, the studio that was developing it closed, right?
1207701	1208761	It was Factor 5, right?
1208801	1210301	And they're not around?
1210321	1211222	I don't know.
1211242	1212422	This is all based on rumor.
1212462	1219284	That's why I say this with a question mark, because I'm sure it was rumored that, like, five different people were developing it, so... Yeah.
1219704	1220485	So, yeah, I mean, it'll...
1222560	1222840	I don't know.
1222860	1224702	I'm just not expecting a lot from it.
1225083	1226404	But people, I'm sure, will love it.
1226424	1228166	Because Twilight Princess was alright.
1229187	1230568	I just didn't really get into it.
1230668	1232430	But maybe I'll try it again later on.
1234452	1234813	I don't know.
1235473	1237876	I like Wind Waker, so I must have something wrong with me.
1239337	1239758	Yeah, you do.
1239878	1240479	No, I'm just kidding.
1241078	1245822	Well, I have something... No, clearly I have something wrong with me because I think Ocarina of Time is so overrated.
1245942	1248564	Like, it is not my favorite Zelda game by far.
1248584	1250906	I don't care for the Nintendo 64 Zelda games at all.
1251026	1255931	I hated the jump to 3D just because I loved Link to the Past so much.
1256411	1260354	Like, that was the next Zelda game just made me want to barf.
1260454	1260935	And I've tried...
1261215	1261935	Guys, I've tried.
1262095	1263656	And honestly... I loved Ocarina.
1263836	1265077	I know, most people do.
1265257	1266298	I admit, I'm weird.
1266998	1271080	I also think most people give too much fan wank to Chrono Trigger.
1271160	1273561	I don't think Chrono Trigger is that great.
1273741	1274221	Like, it's great.
1274241	1275122	How much of it did you play?
1276363	1278625	almost beat it, probably like three quarters of the way through.
1278925	1281007	Why don't they just take a page from Capcom?
1281027	1281747	And I've seen the endings.
1281767	1288132	I mean, we've seen how Capcom can sell these retro games, I mean, that, you know, look like they were on the NES or something.
1288572	1293176	You know, just make another, like, link, you know, a link to the past or something like that.
1293676	1297459	You don't have to go all 3D and, like, all crazy, you know,
1298019	1314441	that's what they do on the Game Boy Advance at least it was a couple years ago all those Game Boy Advance games were kind of like linked to the pasty kind of games but I didn't like them because they were on the freaking Game Boy Advance and I wanted something on my TV although you know get one of the GameCube adapters not the same thing and you know it
1315261	1318584	I'm surprised we don't see Game Boy Advance games on the Wii yet.
1319524	1320585	Like, virtual console?
1342720	1345861	I'm going to have to get out my old system so you can play this game.
1345881	1346681	Well, she may not have to.
1347162	1353864	Castlevania, Rondo of Blood, apparently has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii.
1354024	1359606	Now, this is following a couple weeks of reports that it was rated by the Australian board, it was rated by other boards.
1360026	1368209	Apparently now it has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, which indicates that it will be headed to the Wii.
1369009	1375250	So, and by the way, you had to have a PC Engine CD device a long time ago in order to play this game.
1375590	1379491	Or, you played the PSP remake, but of course that wouldn't be the original.
1379551	1388352	But that, what was it, Akumajo Collection, or whatever it was called, had this and Symphony of the Night, but this game had been quite altered.
1388812	1392093	So, now apparently it is headed for the Wii.
1392133	1397454	What is also interesting about this, not only has this kind of been confirmed thanks to the ESRB, but
1397794	1403115	But also a representative from Hudson has said the game is coming out shortly.
1403515	1404656	But here's the other interesting thing.
1405096	1405756	Not in English.
1406616	1408336	Because it is a virtual console release.
1408396	1409917	It's just an emulation of the old game.
1410257	1413157	They did not go back and touch up any of the language.
1413217	1416798	So it's just... It is exactly what it was back in the day.
1416878	1424180	The only parts of this game that are in Japanese is... Well, even the freaking intro is in German.
1425521	1447143	and then there's dialogue that's like right in between at the beginning of the game right when you rescue people and uh when you fight Dracula and really it's it's like oh Richter it's your wife blah blah blah oh Maria blah blah blah you know whatever I've played the intro though for you haven't I
1448106	1448566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1476189	1495435	well um the last eBay auction I looked at for that game intact was um ending I think at about 150 for a low one okay what do you think about this now do you think that this could possibly devalue that purchase or is this a good thing because more people will get to play the game without having to have all this fancy stuff
1495802	1496483	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1510942	1514104	I'm glad that I had it because I played the crap out of it.
1515085	1519168	And keep in mind, for the longest time, that was the only way I could remotely play it.
1519288	1523912	So I'm sure there's going to be other formerly frustrated fangirls.
1524032	1526153	Ooh, that's actually a good name for a podcast.
1526714	1528455	Formerly frustrated fangirls.
1528935	1531217	Isn't that what you and Tiara's comic book show is?
1531237	1534239	No, that's Monday Comic Mania.
1534339	1534639	Oh, I see.
1534659	1535560	Are you guys on iTunes yet?
1536440	1538543	No, we were going to talk to you about that.
1538803	1539804	Okay, alright.
1540685	1541026	Call me.
1541466	1542527	Have your people call my people.
1542888	1543128	Anyway.
1543228	1543989	My people being me.
1544109	1544730	Rondo of Blood.
1544810	1545170	Sure, me.
1545491	1545951	Call Rob.
1546292	1549516	Which is what will happen if your show doesn't get listed in iTunes.
1549616	1550216	Rondo of Blood.
1551618	1553961	Anything else we should know about this game being on Virtual Console?
1554816	1555616	It's fucking fun.
1556357	1557719	I wonder how much they're going to charge us for it.
1558400	1566368	What are they charging for the other... If Neo Geo games are like $9, I think TurboGraf... Well, you can't say TurboGraf is CD.
1566489	1568811	It's a PC Engine CD, this one.
1569111	1572896	I'm going to guess, with no real basis, they're going to charge $10.
1573817	1575799	What are they already charging for the CD games elsewhere?
1577105	1578146	I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.
1578346	1580667	I don't even know if PC Engine CD has been emulated yet.
1580687	1583228	I thought they did East, didn't they?
1583668	1584309	Or Valus?
1586210	1588391	Yeah, they've done some of the CD games.
1588491	1591272	There's so much on Virtual Console now I can't even keep track of it anymore.
1592533	1594114	But yeah, you know what?
1594214	1595214	I want a lot of people to get it.
1595294	1601618	I would actually love to see people spend the money on this so that Nintendo knows that, hey, we want more.
1604398	1613800	This game, keep in mind, for a long time, this game was considered one of those pinnacles of gaming that you just could not find here.
1613900	1618581	You had to be something special to have it or have good contacts or have money.
1619742	1624243	And I think that it just goes to show that maybe patience is a virtue.
1625563	1626703	A virtual virtue.
1627303	1630644	And by the way, the next game they need to put out is Sapphire.
1631344	1632464	Some comments from our chat room.
1632704	1640087	Ray Ayanami says, thank you for not being the snobby, hur hur, I bought the original for $9,001 kind of collector, DarkSakura.
1640107	1641367	There you go.
1641887	1648969	Well, you know what, there's actually two other games that I would love to see coming on a virtual console, but one of them they would have to translate.
1649889	1650289	And what's that?
1650309	1651810	It's an RPG called Emerald Dragon.
1653257	1655539	Well, I don't see that really happening.
1655719	1656799	Yeah, I don't see it happening.
1656819	1661122	Have you seen any game on virtual console kind of go back and be tinkered with at all?
1661643	1667447	I can only think of Pokemon Snap because it saves pictures to your thing or your Wii board or whatever it's called.
1667607	1668767	Sapphire needs to come out.
1669308	1670929	I don't think they've translated a single game yet.
1672898	1674359	Saffire is a shooter.
1675019	1677480	And I think I might have done Saffire as a classic game.
1677840	1678300	I might have.
1678340	1678960	I'll have to check.
1679561	1687404	But it was one of the first with real-time 3D objects in the game.
1688364	1689624	You know, on a 16-bit system.
1689765	1690025	Nice.
1690845	1693946	So yeah, Saffire is an amazing little shooter.
1694426	1696567	And then I'd also like to see Psychic Storm.
1696907	1698628	That's the game that Dan calls I Get Pissed Off.
1699049	1702470	You're saying psychic custom But Dan says it sounds like they're saying I get pissed off
1703417	1709220	Ray Ayanami says the only game that's had any translation is Sin and Punishment and even then it was only menu text.
1709800	1710901	I did think of another one though.
1711181	1711781	Tecmo Bowl.
1712001	1715142	They went back and screwed with that because they had to take out all the stuff that was licensed originally.
1715162	1715563	Remember that?
1716183	1719745	So they have gone in and altered with ROMs but very, very rarely.
1720285	1722586	So anyhow, we will see what happens with this release.
1722666	1726228	Maybe, who knows, maybe tomorrow by the time you guys hear this podcast it could already be out.
1726268	1728629	I mean when they say shortly that could mean Monday.
1728729	1729729	So we'll see.
1730590	1731530	DarkSakura, what's up next?
1733148	1745318	Well, I was actually going to look for the, see if I had covered it, but in other news, something about Satoru Iwata, who is the Nintendo president, he's not impressed by the iPad.
1746826	1748347	Yes, the iPad happened this week.
1748547	1750828	We didn't really, I think everybody's heard.
1750989	1752049	This is the show, yes.
1752449	1755311	The iPad is coming out and everybody is, well, not everybody.
1755391	1758173	I just didn't see, did it say that it was coming with a stylus or something?
1758353	1761555	No, folks are criticizing it because it looks like a giant iPhone.
1761675	1762195	At least that's me.
1762215	1763396	I am criticizing it for that reason.
1763436	1766038	I would only want one if I could draw on it, you know?
1766758	1768299	If it was like carrying around a Cintiq.
1768559	1771701	I will say though, some of the art stuff on that did look very cool.
1771841	1774183	I could see some of the art playing looked really cool.
1774203	1777165	And I gotta say, I really like the calendar that they showed in it.
1777185	1784209	I thought the calendar seemed really robust and I could really use that, but I'm not paying $4.99 or whatever and that's not even with 3G.
1784269	1786691	I'll tell you, actually, you know what would make me buy that, Rob?
1787151	1787491	What's that?
1788632	1790013	It costs the same as a Kindle and does more.
1790553	1791634	And I can run my Kindle app on it.
1792695	1794717	I bet you the cost does come down, but you know Apple.
1795257	1798940	In a year, there'll be an iPad 2 or an iPad 2.0 or whatever.
1798960	1802062	I see myself getting one if I can actually use it for real art stuff, but I digress.
1802182	1804224	Will Loki be getting an iPad, just out of curiosity?
1806266	1806406	No.
1806966	1807567	Okay.
1808307	1811450	So much he could say, but he just keeps it classy.
1813211	1814612	I'm sorry.
1814632	1816554	Did you watch the press conference out of curiosity?
1816854	1820376	I watched the live blogging of it, and I laughed.
1821177	1821978	I'm like, wow.
1823539	1827921	So, people do realize this is just an iPod Touch, but bigger, right?
1828662	1829703	Slightly faster processor.
1829863	1831984	Whoa, a blazing fast 1 gigahertz processor!
1832164	1834686	Oh my god, that's blazing fast like years ago.
1835446	1837848	I guess for a handheld that's blazing fast.
1837888	1843831	Let's let Jamie get back to the story, but I do want to say real quick, the only thing to tick me off about it too, it doesn't multitask.
1844132	1844572	Like, come on.
1844992	1846553	What kind of computer doesn't alt-tab?
1846753	1851756	But it's so shiny and beautiful, Rob, because that's what people buy Apple products for is because they're beautiful.
1852356	1853117	It's just like my wife.
1853457	1854217	Perfect example.
1854658	1859040	We went to go get a new camera because my camera, whatever, it's... You want me to go get you a drink, Jamie?
1859780	1860181	I'm sorry.
1860201	1861061	I'll make this quick.
1861081	1862102	I have one.
1862302	1863903	It didn't... Is it strong enough?
1864503	1866565	It doesn't hold a charge anymore for whatever reason.
1866605	1867445	So what did my wife do?
1867846	1869066	I want the red camera!
1869847	1874691	She's the perfect Mac Apple product buyer right there.
1874891	1875751	I want the red one!
1875971	1876952	You are incorrect, sir.
1878593	1881956	Any good graphic artist is going to primarily go for a Mac.
1882301	1887465	Great, I hope you have a lot of art programs on the iPhone because that's the only apps it can run.
1887485	1888166	I have Photoshop.
1888806	1890368	Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think that's on the iPhone.
1890388	1890728	Yes, it is.
1891369	1893510	Well, that gives it a pretty piss-poor version then.
1894471	1899015	It's basically just for editing photos taken, but it actually has pretty good image cleaner features.
1899275	1900296	I like it.
1900356	1907000	I mean, I have real Photoshop to actually fix my photos, but back to my story, please.
1907460	1907740	Yes.
1908541	1913864	As I was saying, you know, basically, Iwata agrees with Loki.
1914064	1916686	It's a bigger, you know...
1918368	1918908	IpodTouch
1940838	1964284	and then he also doesn't really care you know about he doesn't think people just want to wear those silly looking glasses to play their video games and also he said that the next DS would not have motion sensor and there's no HD Wii he doesn't think that people would pay money for it oh Iwata
1965307	1966248	Poor special boy.
1966648	1970510	Maybe we should put him in the crayon eating camp.
1972311	1978214	I'm not ready to put him there yet because whether we like it or not, the Wii is really kicking ass when it comes to sales and so forth.
1978234	1979574	So maybe he just has the bicycle helmet?
1979734	1983396	We have to remember, Nintendo doesn't only care about the core gamer.
1983556	1985217	They care about the soccer bombs.
1985477	1988479	They're kicking ass in console sales.
1989059	1992081	Console sales, but software sales, they suck.
1992901	1994462	Except for first-party Nintendo products.
1994611	1996514	That's okay, Nintendo's giving me what I want.
1997776	1999258	I'm holding it in my hand.
1999278	2000540	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom?
2000941	2002243	Well, Capcom gave you that.
2002603	2003244	But it's on Wii.
2004326	2005628	They had to license it.
2007141	2012444	I love this too, this comment in chat, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, but guys, think about it.
2012624	2015426	You can listen to OLR on a bigger screen with the All Games app.
2015866	2019128	Yeah, that's bigger screens really going to help you with a radio app.
2020089	2020809	Think about it.
2021330	2024612	And you can't even put the thing in your pocket because it's so huge.
2025412	2027534	You can kind of put it like under your shirt.
2027774	2032017	Maybe they need to come out with a girdle with a pocket or something that you could carry your iPad under your shirt.
2032737	2033517	You know what's sad?
2033697	2033857	What?
2033877	2037418	Is that one gigahertz processor probably could go into an iPhone.
2038198	2038879	And maybe it will.
2038899	2040679	There'll be a new iPhone this year too, I'm sure.
2040699	2041219	Exactly.
2041379	2047641	And then once you bought your iPad, then the 4G version will come out and you'll have to pay... I've told you the reason I want one.
2048621	2053222	I want it instead of a Kindle because it'll do what the Kindle does plus some other crap.
2053843	2055403	And I use my Kindle app on my iPhone.
2057003	2061005	GameGuru says, remember, this is coming from the guy who's marketing a bigger DSi.
2061085	2062085	He knows his stuff.
2063205	2066146	How's the DSi XL any different from the iPad?
2066226	2066587	It's not.
2067167	2068807	It's equally retarded, okay?
2068907	2069968	Maybe he's just jealous.
2070388	2074629	Actually, I gotta say, some people that I've heard that have played with that thing really enjoy it.
2074869	2076690	They say it does make a big difference.
2077990	2080371	I don't know how, but that's just what I'm hearing.
2080411	2083592	Are they also the people that dial the big number phones, you know?
2083612	2084333	laughter
2085513	2087433	They have one of those oversized phones.
2087453	2088754	Don't hit the buttons.
2088874	2090994	I hit one button and it hits both of them.
2091014	2093375	The kind grandma has to have so she can see the numbers.
2093455	2097155	The ones that are like, you know, it looks like someone put post-its.
2097596	2099516	You could use your whole fist to hit a button.
2101636	2102977	You should have whack-a-mole phones.
2102997	2104077	That'd be awesome.
2105617	2105917	Nice.
2107578	2109498	Alright, how about some different gaming news, Loki?
2110103	2110504	Thanks for watching!
2127525	2140628	But there's basically going to be a new game, I guess a new main entry game as they would call it, which will probably have two games and then one that compiles both of them together that they'll release later on that people will buy anyways.
2142028	2154091	I didn't say when it's coming out, but sometime in 2010 it's going to be seeing a release in Japan, most likely probably holiday, because usually they'll have Pokemon games that come out around April or November.
2155651	2162115	and I believe the April one is HeartGold, except this year it's March.
2162375	2164616	So we're going to go online with this now?
2164937	2172821	I mean, I know they do, isn't there like the trading room over Wi-Fi or something, a very limited kind of online app that you were able to do in the last one?
2173735	2177157	I don't know, Pokemon to me is like... When's Pokemon just going to be an MMO already?
2177337	2179218	I mean, Nintendo is sitting on a goldmine.
2179238	2181260	A Pokemon MMO I think would be huge.
2181280	2184261	But they don't want to embrace online.
2184422	2186403	There's one of those things they get a third party to do.
2186903	2187403	Seriously.
2188144	2196629	I bet there's some MMO developers out there that would suck Nintendo's cock in order to be able to put out the Pokemon MMO and get money off of that.
2196729	2199190	I mean, that is just a goldmine waiting to happen.
2199831	2202853	But Rob, then people wouldn't buy Pokemon games.
2203133	2203273	Yeah.
2203493	2204153	That's not true.
2205454	2210235	Just because World of Warcraft is doing amazingly well, you don't think Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 are going to sell well?
2210275	2212776	And if they wanted to put out a Warcraft 4, you don't think that would sell?
2213616	2214296	They'd still sell.
2214456	2214996	They'd still sell.
2215016	2218057	I don't know.
2218197	2222278	Azure Edge in chat says, Sky, we'd have to enter 1 million friend codes.
2222318	2223359	I don't want to fucking do that.
2223739	2224159	Good point.
2224599	2225379	I don't know.
2226919	2228660	I'm showing Rob Sapphire.
2229571	2230032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2243991	2244731	I have done Sapphire.
2245071	2245291	When?
2245972	2246372	Episode 326.
2246432	2249032	That wasn't that long ago.
2249232	2252193	After I did Starblade and before Donkey Kong Jr.
2252573	2253293	I'm just getting old.
2253313	2254054	I have bad memory.
2254214	2254714	What can I say?
2255194	2257434	Yet here I am clamoring for a Pokemon MMO.
2257454	2258055	What's wrong with me?
2258895	2262096	Anyway, how about another type of MMO of sorts?
2262116	2264216	At least this was one of the original MMOs.
2264816	2270838	And we know that MMOs just draw kids across country to their, you know, pedophile friends.
2271278	2285610	See, that's why they wouldn't do it, because you'd hear the PR newswire go out about some kid that went across country to find their friend, and it ends up being some 40-year-old dude that really likes Pokemon and touching little kids.
2285690	2288232	If Nintendo actually sat down to think about it,
2288712	2312858	there's a way to do it you could do friend codes maybe for just the people that you talk to and party with especially if you're like under a certain age but you could still at least interact in a certain capacity maybe using pre like that's how the Disney MMOs do it there's like pre phrases that are in there even the Phantasy Star games have that to some extent the already put in phrases that you would communicate with if you maybe especially if you were under a certain age
2314289	2315771	Or just an Animal Crossing MMO.
2333610	2333690	E.A.
2333710	2334711	is bringing out a new Ultima game.
2357203	2360424	But, um, don't get too excited because it's not quite what you think.
2360644	2367266	It's called Lord of Ultima, and it's a game where you build your own unique city, and you play with thousands of other players.
2368026	2372768	And, uh, yeah, it doesn't sound like it's really like a role-playing kind of game at all.
2372808	2376189	It sounds almost more like, I don't know, Civilization or something?
2376349	2380450	Which, not that Civ's a bad thing, but they kind of took the Ultima out of Ultima.
2380630	2381030	I don't know.
2381690	2382731	So, uh, yeah.
2383951	2384792	Take with it what you will.
2384832	2392459	I guess it will be hard to know until we actually get our hands on it, but this is their idea on how to revive the Ultima franchise is to give us Lord of Ultima.
2392599	2393360	That's silly.
2393941	2396483	How about just like a really kick-ass Ultima console game?
2396804	2397064	I don't know.
2397084	2399927	I guess the tricky thing about Ultima is that it really was more...
2401167	2405449	It wasn't like a Final Fantasy type of role-playing game, you know, where you hit a button to attack and all that.
2405569	2414153	Even on the NES one, dude, you had to micromanage the food that your people were eating to make sure they weren't going to die of starvation.
2414514	2416835	You had all these status effects that could happen.
2416855	2419256	Your people could die, or they could just straight up turn to ash.
2419976	2422437	And you can't revive someone who's turned to ash.
2422477	2426079	I mean, it kind of kicks up the ante a little bit.
2426099	2428560	It's a tougher game to manage, but rewarding.
2429520	2431742	You know what type of game I think would make a fun MMO?
2431762	2432122	What's that?
2432162	2432862	I was thinking about it.
2433423	2433883	Actraiser.
2434484	2435865	Where everyone plays God.
2436105	2438166	That would be a little bit confusing at some point.
2438206	2438567	I don't know.
2438667	2440548	And then you have Holy Wars and shit.
2441249	2442009	For Sky Cake.
2442750	2442990	Nice.
2444051	2444291	Okay.
2444491	2445552	Well, how about another story?
2446092	2446933	How about Borderlands?
2448323	2450684	Which is what my husband was playing this morning.
2452925	2459227	The Secret Armory of General Nox is the next download content to be coming out.
2460348	2463049	And instead of supposed to have...
2465883	2470185	Like really cool new enemies and a big new place to hang out.
2470825	2478428	And I really have to say that if it's anything like the Island of Dr. Ned, then it's going to be fun.
2478548	2479409	It's going to be pretty great.
2479609	2481489	Also, they're raising the level cap.
2482670	2485711	We don't know how much, but it's raising the level cap.
2485911	2486551	And right now it's at 50.
2487292	2490533	So maybe they'll get Legendary Mounts next.
2490733	2495015	How about instead of an add-on like the Island of Dr. Ned, we get the Island of Dr. Brain?
2497074	2497194	No.
2497214	2498356	Because that was an amazing game.
2499377	2500058	Well, that surprised me.
2500579	2502863	The Island of Dr. Ned involved a lot of brains.
2503934	2504254	I see.
2504274	2507655	It involved timed headshots that would make their... It was zombies.
2507695	2511877	You had to... I'm not going to say why you had to collect the brains, but it was pretty funny.
2512557	2517919	But you had to get headshots on all the zombies to make their brains pop out of their head, and then you would collect their brains.
2519280	2519820	Sounds pleasant.
2520140	2522541	As you turned in your brains, your first mission is brains.
2523121	2524782	Your second mission is brains.
2525242	2527523	Your third mission is brains.
2527543	2528663	The A's would keep increasing.
2529203	2529864	It was pretty funny.
2530364	2530964	And, yeah.
2533479	2539064	Let's travel around the world while Jamie goes and eats some brains.
2539685	2544530	Or maybe some of these yummy potato chips I got at Walgreens.
2544810	2547292	These pita chips, yes, thank you.
2548794	2549274	Ah, yes.
2549715	2554079	This week is kind of the calm before the storm as far as releases go.
2554580	2556842	Not a lot of good stuff coming out, unfortunately.
2558402	2560523	So, instead we- Bite your tongue.
2561103	2561724	Bite your tongue.
2561884	2565425	Why Night Chronicles is this week- Oh, that's right.
2565485	2567326	Well, I said not a lot of good stuff.
2568787	2570587	One title- Sorry, I'm joking on a paper chip.
2570607	2572468	Two titles do not a good week make.
2573169	2576530	Anyways, so, Imagine Reporter, coming out on DS.
2577050	2578631	Whoopity shit.
2578691	2582953	Star Trek Online, though, is making it out this week, both the collector's edition and the regular edition.
2583633	2586115	White Knight Chronicles on PlayStation 3 coming out.
2586335	2588557	And that wraps up the good games coming out this week.
2588817	2592180	And also Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun on the Wii.
2593281	2595142	The Sims 3 High End Lost Stuff.
2596323	2598385	If you want to buy more crap for your fake people.
2600486	2601868	And that would be it.
2605931	2606211	All right.
2608539	2619742	Sorry, I'm playing around in chat room because somebody said, or it was Azure Ed said, did someone say PETA chips, but spelled it P-E-T-A, like the people eating tasty animals?
2620623	2624444	And then I tried to slap him, but I accidentally slapped the wrong person in chat, so there we go.
2624504	2627985	I gave the right person a slap there in the chat room.
2628345	2631286	Anyway, hey, how about Japan and looking at the Japanese releases?
2631306	2633647	I don't know if there's any games in Japan where you can slap people yet.
2634347	2635407	We might need to let Shermie out.
2635527	2637068	Shermie's headed towards the door and wants to...
2637792	2638668	there we go, bye Shermie
2640322	2641142	It's the U.S.
2641162	2643623	version with more, I think there's more language options.
2667913	2670194	And honestly, that is really it.
2670235	2681421	I mean, there's another game on the PS2 called Momo, Tujji, Taisen, Ryoku 2, coming from Systemsoft, that looks to be some type of adventure game.
2681502	2687205	I don't know if it's just... There's little cute little animals there, and that poor girl's sitting in a cardboard box.
2687305	2691508	I don't know why, but I guess it's about a bunch of homeless chicks with big boobs.
2691688	2692528	No, they're all planes.
2692548	2693329	Did you notice that they're all planes?
2693349	2694430	Oh, they're planes.
2694490	2695030	They are.
2697106	2699470	Oh, these girls must turn into planes or something.
2699951	2700572	It's just weird.
2700912	2701253	Yeah.
2701573	2703176	Oh, the Japanese and their fetishes.
2703717	2704458	That is so strange.
2704518	2706161	Her ass is a cardboard box.
2706261	2706722	Look at that.
2707323	2709186	I'm going to link that in chat there.
2709466	2710347	She's a hobo plane.
2711260	2712200	Copy the link there.
2712240	2716262	I'm going to paste that in chat so you guys can check that out and see if it's weird to you.
2716803	2717083	All right.
2717123	2718243	So that's on the PlayStation 2.
2718563	2720504	So they are still cranking out the PS2 games over there.
2721105	2727567	And on the Sony PSP, God Eater comes out.
2728188	2730249	Well, that sounds rather pleasant on the PSP.
2730629	2730889	I don't know.
2730909	2731669	Is that local?
2731789	2734191	Is that some type of game we have here?
2734211	2735331	I think it's based off a manga.
2735931	2736151	Yeah.
2736792	2737252	Oh, it is.
2740254	2741637	It's a fighting game.
2742438	2744923	Yeah, kind of a fighting game but you can take on multiple things at once.
2745824	2746145	Pretty cool.
2748536	2749776	That's it for Japanese release dates.
2749816	2751297	How about the UK, Jamie?
2751757	2754678	Well, for the third, we have Chime on Xbox 360.
2754838	2757579	And then the fifth, we have a number of things.
2757639	2759379	We have Dante's Inferno.
2759820	2762000	We have Disgaea 2, Dark Hero Days.
2762740	2763821	Endless Ocean 2.
2764321	2766602	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Crystal Bearers.
2767362	2769442	MX vs. ATV Reflex.
2770743	2772323	Stalker Call of Pripyat.
2773544	2774804	Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2775304	2776665	Please, everybody, it's not...
2777725	2778985	It's not Silent Hill as you know it.
2779546	2782546	If you like running, you'll love Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2782726	2786668	If you like a lot of frustrating fucking trial and error, then you'll like it.
2788028	2789048	This is kind of funny.
2789288	2792729	They should have combined Walk It Out with Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
2792749	2794250	Wouldn't that be hilarious?
2795210	2797051	Last on my list is the best on the list.
2797551	2798351	Star Trek Online.
2799311	2800312	I have already been playing it.
2800552	2801452	It is tons of fun.
2801912	2805113	Although, now that the beta is over, I have to remake my fucking character.
2805967	2806648	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2821107	2821828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2841287	2869493	but if you were not if you were like looking at your ship sideways you could not turn it around adjust your camera do anything without it trying to readjust itself based on where your enemy was and it would never lock on the enemy when you were close by so it'd be like I'm trying to shoot these Borg I'm trying to shoot these whatever they are I did though I really liked the away missions those were fun
2869830	2875533	Yeah, I liked it when you were on the world as the player, but I didn't care for that.
2875573	2883398	I liked the one mission, I don't know if you did it, it was one of your emergency missions, where you have to go and talk to these miners, and you find out why they're so pissed off at their boss.
2883718	2883958	No.
2884278	2888981	But I think it was such a great thing that had diplomatic missions and little things in there, stuff that...
2889853	2891374	Starfleet Officers Starfleet Officers
2914313	2918555	and you get emergency missions sometimes on your way as you pass by other places.
2919096	2926319	Although really the first thing I'm going to freaking do as soon as my ship is up to it is go hang out at DS9 for a while.
2927420	2927820	It's in there.
2927920	2928320	It's in there.
2928380	2928900	Did you know?
2929060	2929661	No, I didn't know that.
2929701	2930081	That's great.
2930161	2932502	There's a video up of someone actually trying to go through the wormhole.
2932642	2933222	I think it was funny.
2933583	2933883	Awesome.
2935604	2936004	All right.
2936064	2938105	Well, what's up next?
2939185	2940006	Back to some gaming news.
2940086	2942687	I just totally made myself an utter geek.
2944079	2944319	I know.
2945539	2950881	You know, I want to like play Star Trek Online and then just kill all the creatures.
2951721	2956482	Do they have any diplomatic away missions where you're supposed to not kill things and then if you do, that's bad?
2956502	2960523	I think those you just are actually set to talk to them because you can't actually fire at someone who's not an enemy.
2961063	2962283	But you should totally play Klingon.
2963223	2964264	That's unfortunate.
2964684	2965884	You should totally play Klingon.
2966769	2969450	See, that's what I do in Spore, is just kill people.
2969651	2972872	Oh wait, no, I don't do that in Spore because I don't play Spore anymore.
2973433	2974053	That's right.
2974393	2975534	You should just totally play a Klingon.
2975554	2981417	Then you can call your commanding officer a coward and then kill him and take his position.
2982487	2986953	And you know what Spore has to do with this next story they have?
2987413	2988955	Well, both of them have DRM.
2989616	2993440	Ubisoft is now introducing a new online enabled DRM for their PC games.
2994401	2999307	Basically, you're going to be able to install the game on, you know,
3000248	3014724	Whatever PCs you want, you just have to be connected to the internet in order to be logged into your Ubi.com account to play the games, even if you want to just play single player games.
3014784	3021091	Sounds wonderful and all, but somehow I have a feeling that they're going to get around it just as easy as they got around the DRM on the EA games, but...
3022253	3034938	Hey, I guess that's neat and stuff that they don't limit you to how many PCs you can install your stuff onto, but some people out there don't have internet access or don't have broadband internet access.
3035278	3038039	I guess those people won't be buying those Ubisoft games.
3038739	3040520	Just hopefully they make it very clear.
3043395	3053902	But I guess this is kind of similar to some of the Steam games that they have out there now that they require that you're logged in to the internet.
3054482	3056724	But I guess that's not true for all Steam games.
3057845	3058125	I don't know.
3059352	3060313	Well, here's the question.
3060353	3066716	I mean, I understand these gaming companies have to do whatever they have to do to try and curb piracy because it's getting way out of control, especially on PC games.
3066736	3067396	It's so easy.
3068036	3082784	But there's always somebody going to play that card like, okay, well, if you require an internet connection to validate the game, what happens to the military guys overseas who don't have an internet connection and these computer games are a way that they can de-stress in downtime?
3083564	3085586	That card always gets played somehow.
3085926	3091251	Any DRM scheme has to take that stuff into consideration.
3091291	3096155	There are some people who legitimately don't have internet and are trying to legitimately play games.
3096756	3098437	Could they call an 800 number?
3098738	3099198	I don't know.
3099538	3100039	What would happen?
3100339	3103463	I think they're not going to be able to call an 800 number.
3103603	3116941	And really what it's going to come down to is any DRM scheme that you have out there, really there's no way that you're going to be able to ensure that people aren't stealing your product because...
3117862	3119823	There's always going to be a way around everything.
3120483	3133267	Whether it be some extremes I can see them going to as a physical dongle that you have to stick into your USB drive or something like that that authenticates your copy that you have and you can't play it unless that's plugged in there.
3133587	3144950	They do that with some software programs out there but it's very rare and even those can be emulated or copied and nothing's perfect.
3145350	3149654	Well, here's what Frisbee in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and just makes a very clear statement.
3149934	3152757	Frisbee says, DRM will always be cracked.
3153177	3153577	Give it up.
3155439	3155719	Agree?
3156200	3156360	Yeah.
3157160	3161704	Really, and even DLC can be cracked and always is.
3162065	3162305	So...
3192593	3208461	If it's something that's going to inconvenience somebody, whether it be requiring a disk, or you have to be online, or you have to install some sort of rootkit on your system in order for it to work, someone's going to get pissed off and try to hack it around.
3209522	3212163	Some more comments from chat, and Frisbee makes another point here.
3212323	3213824	What happens when the servers crap out?
3216865	3219566	So if these servers that authenticate the games or whatever, what happens if they die?
3219666	3222868	They're going to send out a patch and it'll probably remove the DRM from the game.
3222948	3228210	What if all the servers... Well, that's Steam's contingency plan, supposedly.
3228270	3230611	If Steam were to ever disappear, they would do that.
3231151	3233892	But that isn't the same thing that Ubisoft has necessarily said.
3234052	3234372	I don't know.
3235353	3245297	Ray Ayanami says, If I was a developer, I'd just say fuck it to DRM and just put in a finger-wagging message that says, While we thank you for your interest in this game, we would appreciate it if you'd buy a legitimate copy if possible.
3246499	3252462	You know, I have to admit, I always did like the kind of gotcha thing that some of those Super Nintendo games did.
3252502	3253242	Like, what was it?
3253422	3260026	One of those games, if you were playing, like, a hacked version, Earthbound would be way harder.
3260066	3265709	Like, if you were playing, like, a pirated copy of Earthbound, it would be way harder, and then when you get to the very last boss, it deletes your save game.
3266129	3268490	Like, that's just evil, but kind of funny in a way.
3268550	3272292	I mean, if somebody's pirating it, they can't complain at what the game did.
3272692	3276134	I mean, it might make them really pissed off so they never actually buy the game legitimately, but...
3276854	3282458	Just kind of... Most people didn't know that that kind of prevention was in there until it was too late.
3284259	3287001	Frisbee continues and says, DRM does nothing to stop piracy.
3287441	3288962	Just screws over real players.
3289082	3291143	What pirate would keep DRM in the game?
3291163	3297207	The other thing too, DRM, especially if it's not made in-house, although Oobies might be made in-house or they may be licensed.
3297307	3299108	I don't know if they're licensing it from somebody else.
3299529	3301690	But, I mean, that costs these companies money too.
3301830	3302090	So...
3303451	3309119	If it's just going to get defeated immediately, then you might as well just save the money and just not have it...
3311900	3313281	or just not have the DRM in there.
3313321	3314741	Just save whatever.
3314781	3318042	At least I'm going to save myself X amount of thousands of dollars.
3319102	3321242	D5T in chat kind of half jokes here.
3321342	3324643	Next-gen consoles will need a pin drop of your blood to start the game up.
3325343	3328504	Well, hey, don't they already have laptops now that are like fingerprints or something?
3328524	3331065	Biometric scanners.
3331105	3334306	As that technology comes down, it may be not your blood, but your fingerprint.
3334986	3335406	Who knows?
3336206	3336966	Could you imagine that?
3337006	3339527	You have to press your fingerprint in order to start a game?
3340567	3350434	Why don't they look at how console games are doing DRM and stuff like that?
3350454	3354417	Why don't they look at that and try to match something that they're doing there?
3355098	3355398	I don't know.
3355698	3362424	A decipher in chat reminds us, I think speaking of my whole little Earthbound story there, that happened with a recent release of a game.
3362464	3366067	A guy complained in the forums of a bug and it outed him as a pirate.
3366087	3367528	That was Arkham Asylum, wasn't it?
3367568	3378056	Like there was some type of trick that Batman couldn't do in the copied version and somebody went to the forums to complain about it and it's how they knew that he pirated the game.
3379438	3382661	I mean, at the same time, I kind of look at that and go, that's kind of funny.
3382801	3384723	I mean, they're within their rights to do that.
3384743	3386465	They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto 4.
3386525	3391530	You'd have the drunk cam on all the time if you pirated the game so your camera would be shaking around like you're drunk.
3392090	3395894	But there was a patch within a week of it coming out that fixed that.
3396955	3398276	Same with the Arkham Asylum stuff.
3398296	3400238	There was a patch already fixing that problem.
3402060	3403120	within a week or so.
3404741	3407443	It's just not going to really matter.
3407963	3411385	Everybody's going to find a way around it no matter what you do.
3411645	3416208	So you might as well just give up because all you're doing is delaying the inevitable and wasting money.
3417734	3421816	Alright, well let's move on to one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.
3421836	3425218	And this has to do with what I believe will be a highly anticipated game.
3425979	3431142	Hopefully this doesn't get pirated too much though, because this is some real A-list talent behind this.
3431202	3432923	It's the folks at Platinum Games.
3433303	3434084	Thank you for watching!
3448354	3449314	The game looks awesome.
3449454	3452796	It's called Vanquish, is the game that Loki is referring to.
3453296	3455977	Vanquish appears to be a futuristic shooter game.
3456017	3459478	I guess it takes place in San Francisco, so not that far from here.
3460158	3467101	I guess it's in the future, and well, obviously there's not a lot known about the actual game itself.
3467121	3470902	The trailer used a bunch of cutscenes and live action stuff.
3471923	3474405	Did you actually watch the whole debut on TV?
3474666	3475707	I watched the trailer, though.
3476107	3476528	What did you think?
3476788	3477529	I think it looks cool.
3477649	3479571	I'm definitely excited for it.
3479611	3483335	It looks like something that will be on next-gen consoles, not a Wii game.
3483816	3486218	But even their Wii game, Mad World, is pretty awesome.
3486238	3491023	Unfortunately, not a lot of people play mature games on the Wii, which is really sad.
3492105	3494587	Um, you know, really sweet game.
3494647	3504075	And I, you know, I think for Platinum Games, what they really should do on some of these, you know, mature titles that they put out for the Wii, just to re-release them on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, I think that'd be a great idea.
3504116	3509200	Mad World, support that sucker, you know, with high-definition graphics to, you know, the 360.
3509320	3510822	You know, it'd sell like crazy.
3511342	3513985	I mean, you could sell, you know, the motion controls in there, big deal.
3514005	3516407	Just use something with the right analog stick or something.
3516887	3517187	I don't know.
3517407	3518667	It would be pretty awesome.
3519628	3521688	But this new game looks really cool.
3521728	3523529	I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit more about it.
3523629	3526429	Yeah, because we don't even know what platform it's on.
3526469	3531690	I mean, we can assume, like Bayonetta, it'll be PS3 and 360, but we don't know that for sure yet.
3533591	3536151	And we don't know if it's going to be multiplayer.
3536291	3537732	I mean, we don't know much about that yet.
3537872	3538992	But more to come soon.
3539452	3542074	I imagine this is going to be an E3 all-star right here.
3542154	3542334	Probably.
3542354	3544096	It's going to be something you're hearing a lot about at E3.
3544216	3545056	It's called Vanquish.
3545537	3546157	So look out for that.
3546257	3548879	Obviously Bayonetta, we're huge fans of that here at OLR.
3549560	3554243	Although this is, I mean, it's still the same studio, but it's kind of, it sounds like a different branch.
3554703	3559026	So anything could happen here, but Outlook so far looks pretty good, yeah?
3559127	3561308	I think all their Platinum games have been really good.
3561368	3561769	It's just...
3564372	3564732	I don't know.
3565513	3569216	Unfortunately, mature games don't do well on the Wii.
3570057	3570698	That's too bad.
3571438	3572879	But this one's not going to be on the Wii, right?
3573180	3573760	I hope not.
3574221	3575342	I don't think that it will be.
3575622	3576362	It didn't look like it.
3576523	3578785	Based on the graphics you saw, you're thinking no, right?
3578825	3579005	No.
3580046	3586972	All right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane and some of the classics we always hear every week at Orange Lawn Trader, like take a trip...
3588024	3589925	I don't remember what I picked last time.
3611940	3613421	Do you want me to tell you or do you want to wait?
3614741	3615522	I don't have to look.
3615682	3618983	I'll look it up while you talk about this week's game.
3619463	3621744	But I fully approve of what you've picked for this week.
3621844	3623565	It's about damn time I did this one.
3623685	3624506	It's about damn time.
3625206	3627767	This week's game is Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.
3629248	3638692	And I would love to play the music, but one of those audio difficulties I warned you about before the show was that some things are not installed, including Flash, so I can't use YouTube just yet.
3639352	3639992	Never fear, though.
3640032	3641233	I think I have some...
3642661	3646203	of the ripped files here on my drive, so I'll pull those up instead.
3646223	3647164	Sorry, Jamie.
3647424	3656270	In Japan, it was called Zelda no Densetsu Kamigami no Triforce, which was The Legend of Zelda Triforce of the Gods.
3657731	3657871	And...
3662757	3663938	This is arranged, but still.
3680563	3681744	Dark World Link turns into a bunny
3699915	3718762	Yeah, but I mean, you had all kinds of cool attacks, and you could go get the Master Sword by running through the forest, and you could swim, and just... One of the big things that got me is because it had that sort of dual world aspect to it, that you could often do things in one world that would affect the other.
3718862	3725785	Like, for example, when you're going to the ice level in the Dark World, if you would have to throw your portal...
3727345	3741029	Like, in one place, and then walk to a certain place in the light world, and then use your mirror again, and you would be inside the walls of the fortress.
3741289	3742609	So that was pretty cool.
3743770	3748811	And I really, really liked just the overall play to it.
3748891	3752152	And this is a game that I have gone back and just played a bajillion times over.
3753152	3758137	I mean, I probably have whole sections of this game completely freaking memorized.
3759338	3771068	And I was actually watching people glitching out the game today by trying to run a dash when you call the bird with the ocarina.
3771669	3773350	I think that's in the DS version.
3773991	3778535	Yeah, which reminds me, there is a DS version and, of course, the virtual console version.
3781319	3793964	But yeah, the game came out for the Super Famicom in Japan, and it was released in 1991 and in the US and Europe in 1992.
3795364	3796604	And you know what's funny?
3796645	3799986	I'll tell you another funny thing about this one, Rob.
3800286	3801086	Hey, look what I got.
3801106	3802346	I got the real music here.
3802446	3802787	Look at that.
3802827	3803807	Here, let's hear this for a minute.
3804707	3811172	I like this particular game because it's a bunch of different musics.
3811992	3812353	I'm sorry.
3812393	3813413	I just have to say for a minute.
3813494	3814134	I'm sorry, Jamie.
3814174	3815175	I know you have more to say.
3815995	3817776	There's a lot of controversy going on in chat right now.
3818057	3819137	Some people are saying, I love this game.
3819157	3820138	Some people are saying, I hate this game.
3820298	3823000	I personally, well, not that they hate it, but it's not the best in the series.
3823761	3826643	By far my favorite Zelda game they ever put out.
3827043	3827823	Great music.
3828044	3828984	Great gameplay.
3829905	3831746	This is by far my favorite Zelda game ever.
3831766	3831946	I agree.
3832086	3832927	I think that it's my favorite.
3832927	3833527	My favorite too.
3833888	3835489	Although I do really like Ocarina.
3838792	3844356	But now, actually there was a little bit more to this one.
3844576	3847179	Actually, did you know that there was a comic that came out?
3848760	3850341	It was actually published in Nintendo Power.
3851602	3853384	And they put it out in the US too.
3854084	3854925	Do you remember that, Rob?
3856346	3857667	The Zelda comic from Nintendo Power?
3858348	3859929	Very vaguely.
3860009	3860449	Here we go.
3861110	3862451	There's actually a picture from it.
3864590	3865690	If any of that looks familiar.
3866790	3870392	It's by the same guy who did the... I think who did Howard and Nestor.
3871292	3873233	Yeah, I vaguely remember it.
3874693	3875474	Well, at any rate...
3877245	3880127	There was another follow-up to Link to the Past that came out in Japan.
3880187	3888934	It was BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban, which is BS The Legend of Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets or Stone Tablets of Antiquity.
3889394	3894037	That was one of the Satellaview games and you could voice broadcast using the sound link.
3895138	3921151	and it was supposed to be set around the same time as Link's Awakening but you don't use Link you play as the Heroes of Light and who they are are the Satellavie mascots who you could also see in BS Zelda No Densetsu which I had a the Satellavie one ran on like a time system and there are hacked ROMs out there where you can play with your time counter turned off um
3924306	3932893	And then there was another version of A Link to the Past that came out on Satellaview as well.
3934395	3938318	Then, of course, there was A Link to the Past and Four Swords.
3939359	3940120	There was also...
3942262	3948147	If I'm right, I think they actually reserved a lot of the sound effects for Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, so that was pretty cool.
3949728	3953491	But that is, overall, I'd have to say probably my favorite in this series.
3956014	3956474	Very worthy.
3958596	3961498	If no one's played this game, I pity you.
3961738	3962339	I pity Dafu.
3964434	3965797	Go get it on Virtual Console.
3966138	3967120	Seriously, at least.
3967481	3969485	You can actually get the cart kind of cheap, too.
3969946	3973333	Just one thing to remember is it doesn't run on a battery backup, so you have to be a little careful.
3973654	3974676	We still have our saved games.
3976400	3979423	Actually, this is one of the games now that I'll just sit and play with the Game Genie on.
3980624	3982285	Just so I can just run through the whole game.
3982305	3987289	Because, I mean, for me, what I like to do is I like to play through the game once without cheating.
3987409	3991873	And then I like to just cheat like a mofo the second time through and just enjoy the story.
3992413	3996557	But even so, I mean, this wasn't super hard.
3996577	3997758	There were really difficult parts.
3998458	4000640	This is some of my favorite music in the game right here.
4000660	4001681	I love this song.
4002762	4003662	In the early palaces.
4005384	4006585	Sorry.
4006665	4007886	No, I like that music too.
4011269	4018594	I never liked the palace music from the... This is the force music.
4023979	4026020	One of the most amazing game soundtracks ever.
4026040	4030764	I know a lot of people think Final Fantasy is where all the music's at, but this seriously... Seriously.
4031185	4031745	Zelda's got...
4033286	4034227	Just awesome music.
4034287	4038570	Well, you know the big thing, it's actually showing Baking Through the Palace.
4039290	4050437	I love the little touches in it, like if you had the places that you could fall off the cliff, you could make the guys charge you, and they would run off the ledge, or you could throw a pot at them, and they would fall off on the ledge.
4051078	4052158	You know, I thought that was great.
4052178	4053559	Or you could just throw a chicken off the ledge.
4053579	4062425	Actually, you know what one of my favorite levels in this one was, where you go to the thief's village, and you have to take the girl into the sunlight, and she turns into Blind the Thief.
4062865	4063566	That's right.
4064246	4069931	That was, and I love, this is the game that made the hookshot replace the boomerang.
4070592	4074735	Was it just me, or was the hookshot the single best item in the damn game?
4076237	4077578	That and the freaking medallions?
4079099	4080801	Maybe, I do remember the hookshot being pretty odd.
4080821	4084183	The bomb goes medallion, it sets the world on fire, it was fantastic.
4085444	4088327	But yeah, this, totally, totally, totally, totally my game.
4089184	4090644	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4090664	4092285	A true classic in many respects.
4092465	4094926	Zelda, A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo.
4096266	4099187	And most surprisingly, DarkSakura picked a non-Sega game this week.
4099207	4099727	I'm very proud.
4099987	4101207	Actually, I picked a non-Sega game on purpose.
4101247	4104808	By the way, Rob, I do have something that I might be able to lend you if you've still got Super Nintendo.
4105649	4107549	I don't know if I have a Super Nintendo still.
4107649	4108850	Didn't we give you the Super Nintendo?
4109230	4110190	No, it was a regular Nintendo.
4110310	4110890	Oh, okay.
4111030	4112871	In the midst of moving to is not a good time.
4113411	4113931	Plenty later.
4114011	4114771	But in a month, yeah.
4115552	4117092	We have two copies of Super Mario RPG.
4117719	4118119	Oh, sweet.
4118900	4119180	Sweet.
4119280	4120700	I need to find my copy of Super Metroid.
4120740	4122121	That's a game I really want to play again.
4122261	4123241	Maybe we have another one?
4123281	4125182	I could do the Wii console thing, but you know.
4125242	4127923	There's something about playing Super Metroid on the right system.
4128103	4129904	It's having the Super Nintendo controller.
4130364	4131545	It's having that same controller.
4131705	4134566	Rob, you need to call in sick to work and hang out with me tonight and play some Super Metroid.
4135166	4136348	I would love to if I could.
4137389	4138530	Call him dead.
4138630	4139311	Here's the great thing.
4139371	4147361	When I get my new place that's going to be by myself, I can set it all up without anybody complaining or having other things.
4147561	4148442	You could just come over.
4148622	4149563	We plug in the system.
4149583	4150044	We're good to go.
4150104	4150825	We broadcast.
4151085	4152727	We can do that kind of stuff on the fly a lot easier.
4152747	4153548	It's going to be amazing.
4153748	4154269	That's what we should do.
4154289	4154709	I'm excited.
4155450	4155590	Woohoo!
4179051	4180973	It's not more Top Trumps is it?
4195248	4221457	I know it's free on Xbox Live and Playstation 3 some of the early reviews I heard on it were very good I downloaded the free version on Playstation 3 because I think it hit that marketplace a couple days before the Xbox one you can download the pilot for free in HD so I still want to check that out maybe I'll see if the chat has anything to say about Caprica while we take a break tonight but for those of you on the podcast we'll be back in just a couple seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4228223	4232305	Hello everybody out there and welcome back to another Part B here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4232385	4238847	It's episode number 353 and trying to have fun with our new mixing board and some of our audio setup.
4238867	4247430	We're still trying to get used to some things and the podcast listeners won't really hear this, but the live listeners are hearing some interesting fluctuation in our audio when we stop the recording.
4247510	4248431	So we're still trying to...
4249031	4270167	figure everything out here at OLR Studios but for the most part the feedback we're getting so far is that the soundboard sounds really good in fact I was going to get into Twitter topics a little bit here but one of the early tweets I have here is from Blue Swim on Twitter saying at OLR very nice soundboard hope you guys get to try it out tonight and yes we're here we're live so I hope he's listening
4271548	4278352	We'll get back into some Twitter topics in just a minute, but first, thought we could get into some rapid fire news here in studio.
4278392	4282234	We have a lot of news to cover tonight, so Loki, what's on deck?
4282555	4291760	Yes, lots of Capcom release dates, including Super Street Fighter 4 has been announced to be coming out in North America on April 27th.
4293562	4304577	Lost Planet 2 also now on May 18th and I don't believe it was in the article here but Monster Hunter Tri coming out April 20th as well.
4306039	4309905	They're waiting to announce that because of the classic controller pro being bundled in there.
4312827	4324297	One game, though, that is going to be not coming out soon will be No More Heroes Paradise, the kind of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 port of the Wii title.
4325078	4328881	That was originally supposed to be coming out in Japan on February 25th.
4329281	4334346	However, now it's been pushed back, and no word yet on when it's going to be coming out.
4334806	4337408	They're looking maybe at some point in April now.
4339449	4347072	Red Seal 2 is coming out March 23rd in the US and March 26th in Europe.
4347572	4353614	That will be available both the game by itself and bundled with Wii Motion Plus.
4356015	4356936	It looks pretty awesome.
4357056	4358816	Way better than the first one.
4360357	4361037	Which is a relief.
4362774	4370245	Alright, well I got some news for you as well, including God of War 3 I was talking about a little bit during my gaming week, watching the demo get played there.
4370426	4371067	It is dated.
4371707	4374151	March 16th is the date that this game is coming out.
4374592	4375794	That's not that far away.
4375854	4377777	That's only like a month and a half, if that.
4378277	4379918	There's a lot of good games coming out in the spring.
4380058	4383219	This is a very weird year that we have so many.
4383259	4386641	I mean, usually there's a couple big games in the spring, but we have a lot.
4387121	4391123	I mean, March 16th is just a week after Final Fantasy XIII, isn't it?
4393024	4393284	Yeah.
4393444	4396466	That's a huge PS3 and 360, to be fair, title as well.
4396486	4397126	I mean, this is huge.
4397747	4400248	There's also an Ultimate Edition, by the way, of God of War 3 coming out.
4401188	4404611	There's going to be a replica Pandora's box that will have the game in it.
4405292	4408215	There's also going to be some DLC included as well as some other collectibles.
4408835	4411438	Of course, God of War 3 is a PS3 exclusive.
4411938	4414140	Heavy Rain is a controversial-ish game.
4414160	4416122	Did you hear about some of the nudity in Heavy Rain, apparently?
4416342	4419565	I've seen some of the nudity in Heavy Rain there.
4419865	4420266	It's all right.
4420286	4421407	I mean, it's just, you know...
4421852	4423233	I'm just trying to be a little bit movie-ish.
4423273	4427815	Well, if you want to see it for yourself, I don't know if you get to see nudity in the demo, but maybe you can find out what this game is all about.
4428315	4429796	That'll be on February 11th.
4429976	4433998	There will be a demo available on the PlayStation Network, both in Europe and North America.
4434038	4436939	That's February 11th, not too far from now.
4437579	4444783	Two chapters in the demo, one where you are the FBI agent Norman Jaden, and then the other one, I guess...
4447802	4466510	Some type of private investigator Also, Lost Planet 2 has a release date And some Gears of War characters apparently are going to be making a cameo in the game as well That's kind of interesting Marcus and Dom from Gears of War I'm guessing they'll be only in the 360 Call it a hunch, yeah, you're probably right
4467170	4468892	There's some new trailers, by the way, on Xbox Live.
4468912	4476022	Maybe they'll have like Nathan Drake or something like that from Uncharted or something in the PS3 one.
4476062	4476723	That'd be kind of neat.
4477384	4479146	God of War or Kratos.
4479847	4480768	That'd be kind of weird.
4482410	4500349	Alright, apparently for the live folks, our stream dropped while we were doing some of the reporting right there, I don't know why that happened, but apparently it fixed itself, I didn't have to do anything, weird, I was just reading right on through the news, apparently our stream dropped somewhere in there
4501986	4504368	Alright, just another wonderful night here at OLR.
4504448	4505269	Alright, good times.
4505709	4509011	Hopefully just a hiccup in the cable, not anything about our new software, I hope.
4510052	4511613	Anyhow, let's hope we get through the rest of the show.
4511674	4512914	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
4513555	4514416	We'll make it through the show.
4515436	4526645	So, for more Star Trek Online news, since we did go into it just a little bit in the last part, they're actually doing a patch for launch day.
4527025	4528787	I patched it when we were starting the show.
4529087	4530388	So, for the...
4532162	4533062	Well, no wonder we're dropping.
4533223	4535124	No, I'm kidding.
4535224	4536084	I did it before we went live.
4537765	4541847	But they're already working on the first big update for the game.
4542607	4554173	They're not really saying exactly what, but there's going to be more PvP, exploration missions for the Klingons, and more ground-based fleet stuff, as in huge-ass quests.
4554693	4555594	There's going to be raids.
4557529	4563602	And also, also Rob, they're thinking about having Q and time travel.
4563743	4564444	Oh, that's kind of cool.
4565005	4565787	Yep.
4565887	4566970	How about Seven of Nine?
4568456	4569277	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4594565	4600208	There's also Federation vs. Federation PvP, which will be kind of interesting, I guess.
4601348	4603429	Dude, I want the Mirrorverse stuff to come in.
4603629	4608411	And, you know, down the line we're supposed to be getting Cardassian and Romulan factions as well.
4610432	4614974	So I guess you have for the Federation, then you have Kapla!
4615635	4617155	You know, for the Klingons, sorry.
4618316	4618536	Anyway.
4619526	4621748	So yeah, Darwinia is our next news.
4622508	4627112	And it should be coming out on Xbox Live on February 10th.
4628132	4639080	And it's supposed to be free on February 10th, from what I understand.
4639260	4648067	And then $15, I think you have to pay for the minimum sales, I think, later on, if I'm reading this correctly.
4649727	4658829	and then another good thing is After Burner Climax will be coming to the US and actually into Europe for the spring.
4659910	4669412	It says it's going to be on Xbox Live, Arcade and PlayStation Network and it's basically going to be the full arcade port.
4669432	4670452	It's pretty cool.
4671833	4672953	Now where's my Planet Harrier?
4676114	4677474	You'll have to wait for that I guess.
4679847	4683209	Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics, although my mouth is full here.
4683289	4685571	So, I'm going to have Loki answer the first one here.
4686451	4687752	Oh, actually, here's a question.
4688072	4690934	From Blue Swim, and no theme music tonight, guys.
4690954	4691715	Sorry, I didn't queue it up.
4692275	4694697	Blue Swim says, have any of you played Mercenaries 2?
4695537	4698079	It's kind of like Grand Theft Auto meets Earth Defense Force 2017.
4698579	4699260	It's a ton of fun.
4700060	4702582	It is a very glitchy-ass game.
4702682	4707705	Yes, I've played lots of Mercenaries 2, and yeah, it's horrible.
4707845	4709126	Horribly Glitchy
4732174	4736778	TigerClaw305 on the Twitter sends us a story about a woman who loses 112 pounds.
4736838	4738479	Links us to a story here on Kotaku.
4738919	4744884	A 38-year-old British woman, apparently so big she didn't want to have sex with her husband.
4746806	4754011	You know, it's sad, but unfortunately some of those images they put out on TV about what the perfect woman looks like, quote-unquote.
4754031	4758375	It causes this to happen to some people where she wasn't even wanting to...
4760776	4763118	It didn't even feel comfortable enough to show her husband, you know what I mean?
4763538	4767800	So anyway, apparently she lost 112 pounds, all thanks to WeFit.
4767820	4774183	Her name is Laura Roberts, and she came out and said she went from 252 pounds down to 140 in a year.
4775284	4778946	And by the way, though, they do say there was a dietary part of this as well.
4779246	4782508	And I think that's always important to know when we talk about these games that help you lose weight and everything.
4782848	4786110	You're not going to magically lose weight just by playing one of these games five minutes a day.
4786750	4807360	You have to make a, I believe Jamie's used this term before on the show and I like it, a lifestyle adjustment Yes Because you have to make better choices in eating as well And you have to, you know, do the game on a somewhat regular basis for a somewhat extended period of time for this to work It just has to, it's a lot of changes, you know, I'm even wanting to get our DDR night started back again
4808428	4822576	uh the tab the news of the world apparently said she ditched the comfort eating and that added up to 4,000 calories a day well of course she lost weight yeah well and Wii Fit just helped her probably tone it as she was losing it so it didn't all kind of come out of one place you know
4823086	4824167	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4846326	4847747	You know, so she had the right idea.
4847787	4850830	You cut out the comfort eating, you realize, you know, what it is that you're doing it for.
4851410	4854192	And, you know, you can enjoy your food, that's the point.
4854272	4856254	But, you know, it is fuel first and foremost.
4857054	4857295	Alright.
4858055	4860277	Ray Ayanami on the Twitter sends us a tweet.
4860557	4863860	Death Smiles will get a US localization by Axis Games.
4864440	4865901	They're the ones that make BlazBlue.
4865961	4869704	And yes, I remember that on the list for last week, the show that didn't happen.
4870305	4873627	Did I say... I always say BlazBlue because there's no extra E. Well...
4874548	4875088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4899326	4927949	Save and play back your own replays And there's online rankings and online co-ops So this looks to be a pretty robust little shmup And it's not something on Xbox Live It's a full disc release So it looks to be pretty intense And I know Ray is a big fan of the shmups So he's probably got his eye on this one And lastly, from SSJ100Matt on Twitter Saying, although his Twitter name is Matt Osterowski And I always mispronounce his last name, sorry Courtney Love now says that Kurt Cobain would have liked Guitar Hero 5 Bitch be trippin'
4930000	4930781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4950680	4951641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4979542	4988264	And if you go way back to when we first covered these stories, they didn't read the contract, they were signed in, and they probably had that whole thing misrepresented.
4988304	4989425	There was fault on both sides.
4990225	4993105	One side didn't read it, the other side didn't represent it accurately.
4993706	4994586	I bet you that's what it is.
4995146	4997206	There's always three sides to every story.
4997246	4999087	Your side, my side, and the truth.
5000347	5001928	So, anyhow.
5003248	5005769	Let's get back into some other gaming news.
5006169	5007189	Loki, what you got for us?
5008021	5012523	Well, I got some more information regarding the Microsoft Game Room.
5014304	5020468	This is not really a big surprise to me, but apparently your classic Xbox Live Arcade games won't work with the Game Room.
5020948	5033935	So, for example, if you bought Frogger, or even some of the Konami games that they had on there, like Time Pilot and whatnot, you will not be able to play those games in Game Room.
5033955	5035976	You will have to purchase them again.
5036876	5044184	and, um, mainly they're saying that some of those, you know, were revamped versions on, um, you know, Xbox Live.
5044484	5048569	And honestly, I think some of them weren't, but, you know, they're just...
5050185	5051526	Probably they have licensing.
5052366	5058411	The revamps, like especially when you look at some of those Konami games like Frogger and stuff, new graphics.
5058911	5059271	That's it.
5059891	5063334	Like some redone sprites that are more colors and stuff.
5063354	5063974	That's really it.
5064815	5068938	It's a little shady, but we kind of knew it was coming.
5069278	5069798	You know what I mean?
5070058	5074541	We kind of knew it was coming, that there was not going to be, or that you were going to get screwed.
5074561	5075982	You'd have to buy all these things over again.
5076062	5077003	I mean, this isn't a surprise.
5077483	5080025	It's disappointing, but whatever.
5080826	5092201	You know they're going to come out and say, you know, A, because of the redone stuff and the separate achievements and the leaderboards that are unique to the games and the fact that in Game Room you can play them on the PC if you pay a certain amount and da-da-da-da-da.
5093880	5098544	I'm sure they have reasons up the yin-yang, but just in the end, you know, you do feel a little bit disappointed.
5098564	5103788	But at the same time, did Nintendo let you download something on Virtual Console for free just because you own the cart?
5104869	5105109	No.
5106290	5107751	So, no surprise.
5107851	5111634	Yeah, but I mean, this is like the same, you know, online service.
5111714	5112115	It's just...
5112535	5128450	I don't... I've bought a lot of those earlier, because I do love classic games, and I bought a lot of... I bought, like, Russian Attack, I bought all these games I barely even were familiar with, and I'll... If I want them in Game Room, I'll probably have to buy them again, but I'm just not going to on principle.
5128590	5130412	Yeah, and I'm not going to... That's where I stand.
5130452	5132314	I'll buy some of the... Like, the Atari... Well...
5132874	5153532	I don't even know because some of those Atari games I have too but depending on what game room will give me with these classic games you know if there are things like robust leaderboards and medals and things I might consider buying some of those really really good Activision games that I would play over and over again like the original Pitfall I still love that game and would play that a lot I would
5155509	5156529	They need to fix the D-pad.
5157530	5163732	That's really what the... That's why I plan on buying everything on the computer too because it's the whole laptop and with me on the go and everything.
5165713	5167294	Fix the D-pad, Microsoft.
5167334	5167794	Come on.
5167814	5168394	That would be nice.
5168755	5170375	Make a revision to your controller.
5170415	5171536	Maybe an E3 surprise.
5171556	5171856	Who knows?
5172165	5176868	Sky, what if they were to do some sort of bundle, a discount for the XBL and Game Room at the same time?
5188917	5189438	Thanks for watching!
5208331	5210454	But I will refuse on principle.
5210514	5212216	I am not rebuying Frogger.
5212236	5213457	I'm not rebuying Joust.
5213497	5218083	I'm not rebuying anything that I already have on Xbox Live Arcade, which is quite a bit.
5218483	5222048	So Konami probably won't be buying much of your stuff unless you really dig deep.
5222308	5227835	You're going to have to put out like Time Pilot 83 and some of these things that you missed the first time.
5228539	5245048	and the other thing too about Game Room that they announced too is that it's not going to be including any T or M rated content it's going to be E10 plus only so one of the games that they're talking about no Death Race 2000 unfortunately
5246722	5247282	Thanks for watching!
5264247	5266229	Game Room is for really old games.
5283704	5284084	S, DarkSakura,
5313143	5318586	I think the games you're going to be seeing in Game Room are like 25 years or more old.
5319486	5322227	Like before the great video game crash of 84.
5324348	5324928	We'll see though.
5327708	5328368	I could be wrong.
5328408	5328809	And who knows?
5329329	5336391	Game Room's supposedly going to deliver a thousand games, although I think there's going to be certain fudging of that number.
5336531	5343913	I think they'll give us a thousand games, but that means Crystal Castle's on the Atari, Crystal Castle's in the arcade, Crystal Castle's on television, Crystal Castle...
5348619	5367252	GameGuru says games before the NES kinda sucked um no there were a lot of great games back in the day it's just by today's standards the short attention span that today's gamers have I don't think would appreciate a lot of those old games from the past like a very very simple game like Kaboom roll the paddle back and forth collect bombs that fall
5368012	5369233	Disgustingly Simple Game
5393680	5404689	Freeway Drag Race They were very one name things So it was just different Amiga777 asked Was Tempest really fun?
5405009	5412895	Yeah, it was a great shooter I think it's still really fun today Especially Tempest 2000 Tempest 2000 is the shit Anyway
5413416	5414457	Alright, let's move on.
5414477	5415917	Sorry, some other gaming news.
5416838	5418879	Trying not to focus on the past too much here.
5418919	5419219	Whoops.
5420060	5421680	Monster Hunter Frontier.
5421780	5424402	This is a new game between Capcom and Microsoft.
5424422	5425823	It's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360.
5427163	5427924	Here's the deal.
5428404	5431145	Apparently it's a port of a PC MMO.
5431225	5434927	That's right, it's an MMO coming to the 360, a Monster Hunter.
5435588	5439570	There is a little trailer that was released and Capcom put out a few details this week.
5440231	5456131	apparently the way the subscription plan will work you get what's called a Hunter Life course coupon for about 15 bucks and you get access to the game for 30 days and you get an Xbox Live Gold subscription with that for that month kind of interesting
5456834	5458435	How much is Xbox Live a month anyway?
5458455	5459316	It's like five bucks.
5459796	5459996	Is it?
5460476	5460637	Yeah.
5460777	5461557	So interesting.
5461597	5468601	I wonder if you could buy, like for those of us that bought Xbox Live for a year, what happens if you just want to buy like a few months of this game?
5468801	5473644	They'll just keep adding it to your year because you can store up to like five years worth of live.
5473784	5474985	Well, that's a little ridiculous.
5475045	5482289	And also just a forewarning, it's really hard to cancel once you've put your credit card in there to pay.
5482449	5484030	It auto-renews, by the way.
5484250	5484811	Yes, it does.
5485419	5493703	And it's a pain in the ass, and you have to call them up, and then they give you... Because I was paying for some of our other coworkers, you know, just to have their accounts going.
5494464	5500307	And now that they've left, it's kind of hard to get rid of the account, especially when I'm paying for it.
5502845	5505167	Alright, reading some comments from chat.
5505187	5508651	There's still some comments from the last story going on here about Game Room.
5508671	5509932	VidPower says, That's awesome.
5509952	5512654	Oh man, that would be so much fun to just whip out the Atari 2600 and play that for a few hours.
5512674	5512995	GameGuru says,
5526127	5543797	I think there's still some good ones out there Salacious Pop in chat says when the 2600 came out people were OMGing that they could alter what happened on their TV screen they moved the paddle and the dot moved very true, why do you think those pong they had machines that were only pong it was pong for your TV and that was it
5544457	5547879	That was like before the Odyssey, which was before the 2600.
5548800	5555224	And those things still sold because, exactly right, people were oohing and aahing because they controlled what was on the screen.
5555545	5556545	And that was really a first.
5557186	5557686	Think about it.
5558367	5563930	Television before that, you don't control what's on the screen besides changing the channel, which doesn't really count.
5564891	5566492	So, anyhow.
5567473	5570415	Sorry for the tangent there, but those were some good comments around the room from chat.
5570774	5572856	What's the show if there's no tangent?
5572876	5574197	What is the show without a tangent?
5574397	5575198	How about Doctor Who?
5576339	5577260	Speaking of tangents...
5578745	5585389	BBC is pretty interested in doing video games after the Doctor Who relaunch.
5585569	5591914	They want to do ones that are complementary to each other instead of competition.
5592694	5594816	So I guess it's going to be episodic.
5595877	5597238	That's how I would translate that.
5597938	5602822	Or have things that go from one to the other like transferable content.
5603762	5612554	Um, but they're saying that their ideas involve, quote, boxed product console games, virtual worlds, and other experiences.
5613215	5615477	So who knows, maybe we'll get a Doctor Who MMO.
5616058	5617240	But all the Time Lords are dead!
5618639	5624226	Random question out of the blue, wasn't there like a Doctor Who game on the DS that was kind of eh?
5624246	5624946	It was Top Chumps.
5625908	5634858	Top Chumps is like playing war with cards, only you pick a stat, and then the other person picks a stat, and whichever stat wins, you take that card.
5636700	5638362	So you play kind of for ante, but not...
5639582	5640042	Interesting.
5640143	5641984	So it wasn't a very robust kind of game.
5642044	5644446	It was a fun way to pass time.
5644546	5649790	I'm hearing this story and I'm thinking, well, there was a Doctor Who game, but it sounds like it wasn't very Doctor Who-y.
5649810	5652132	Well, our buddy Rob overseas sent me my copy.
5652152	5652792	Yeah, that's what I thought.
5652812	5656115	I seem to remember you got a copy of it from an overseas listener and were playing it.
5656835	5657836	No, don't get me wrong.
5658096	5658577	I liked it.
5658697	5659457	It was pretty fun.
5659978	5662219	Even though it had Martha all over it and I don't like Martha.
5662600	5665202	But Season 3 Doctor Who just was really weak to me.
5665982	5666163	But...
5667363	5668164	It was a fun game.
5668584	5670745	It wasn't super engaging is what I'm saying.
5670785	5678109	It's not depth of story or anything that adds to the Hooniverse.
5679769	5682051	Decipher in chat says, An MMO would suck.
5682111	5683231	Everyone's a Time Lord.
5683351	5684532	Time traveling would be hectic.
5685132	5688774	And SSJ100Matt wins the chat by saying, President Cat is a Time Lord.
5689474	5690775	President Cat is a Time Lord.
5692672	5695094	Actually, that would be the sequel to President Cat.
5695295	5696836	That would be the sequel to President Cat.
5696876	5697617	Time Lord Cat.
5700020	5700861	Or Lord Cat.
5701081	5703564	Instead of President Cat, Queen Cat or something.
5703584	5704385	I forget it.
5704867	5721333	and for the record to tell our dear friend Brad from PodCulture in the chat room Martha was so she didn't get good until she was off of the show I'll put it that way as a character she didn't get good until she was off of the show
5722433	5728236	She was this silly little girl with a crush and yeah, she's smart.
5728276	5731158	She really couldn't think her way out of the paper bag when it came to common sense.
5731238	5731558	Sorry.
5732339	5734260	But it's all about Donna.
5735620	5739943	Loud, obnoxious, and smarter than she thinks.
5740743	5745386	And I'm not going to go into the whole Rose Doctor fandom.
5746611	5747933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5766209	5769572	She took on a little bit too many of the... Not to say that she was a bad character.
5769632	5769992	I loved her.
5770012	5771013	She was very well fleshed out.
5771554	5773775	She and the Doctor were believable together.
5775017	5778920	But there were certain elements that just seemed like, okay, we're doing this for the fans.
5780001	5788308	But even so, Rose was still amazing, but I still think that Donna... Well, my favorite of all the companions is Sarah Jane, to this day.
5789228	5794453	Even back to her old episodes, including the badly written Ark in Space with the bubble wrap larva creatures.
5795093	5797635	They made the creatures out of green bubble wrap.
5798596	5799136	Low budget.
5800697	5801258	Doctor Who?
5803859	5805621	No, it's what little I've seen of it I've liked.
5805661	5808463	I just haven't committed the time to sit down and watch more episodes.
5808583	5811084	Donna is fantastic, amazing, especially as Dr. Donna.
5812766	5814467	Alright, back to video games, Loki.
5815416	5833534	So, you may remember we talked about this a few weeks ago, that Datel was pissed off at Microsoft for locking out their third-party memory cards, which kind of sucks, because Microsoft memory cards are only like half a meg, or not even half a meg, half a gig, and they're like $49.99.
5833634	5838679	For that price, you might as well just buy a hard drive, because it's going to cost you about $50 more, but you get...
5840900	5842261	You know, like 40 times the space.
5843102	5851547	Anyways, so now Microsoft has registered a motion to dismiss the antitrust lawsuit, which was filed by Datel.
5852267	5859571	And basically they're citing that other rivals, like Apple, for example...
5860772	5864017	Have a lockout on different things for their systems.
5864097	5867661	For example, you can't run OSX on computers not made by Apple.
5868883	5874090	So why should you be able to use non-Microsoft memory cards on your Xbox?
5874230	5876133	I think that's a little different, but whatever.
5878035	5890670	They're also claiming, though, that they don't want to undermine the quality of the user experience on Xbox Live by allowing Datel to release cheat-enabling memory cards.
5892321	5896484	But from what I remember, I don't think the memory cards that they had were cheat enabling.
5896684	5900566	It was basically just allowing you to run more space or, you know, have more space on there.
5900586	5905330	Like instead of having a half a gig memory card, you have an eight gig memory card, which is way cheaper.
5906931	5909953	So I don't know if it's really the same thing.
5909993	5915036	But yeah, I can understand where Datel, you know, they do release a lot of their cheat devices and stuff for different consoles.
5917608	5918209	I don't think it's fair.
5918789	5921972	It's an interesting comparison, but what do you think is ultimately going to happen?
5921992	5926936	Do you think Microsoft's got a point, or do you think Datel's going to win?
5927657	5928838	I don't think Datel's going to win.
5932181	5936144	Because I think it's their system, but then again, they may...
5941073	5949937	I think that they should allow them to maybe manufacture third-party hard drives or something like that because as far as their storage goes, they're really limited on what they allow other vendors to do.
5949997	5954699	It's basically just either wired controllers or...
5956761	5957261	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5973214	5974194	Thanks for watching!
5996582	6011992	I don't know alright I'm surprised Datel didn't find a way to kind of hack those things but I guess it's not possible with hardware they tried I think but yeah it's kind of hard to do that with a memory card but can you imagine though if you could make a memory card the size of one of those hard drives that'd be awesome
6013092	6017754	Alright, let's move on to some other news involving Microsoft, and it is the indie games.
6018574	6031039	Indie games, some of the sales figures for 2009 were released, and the best-selling game, Xbox Live Indie Game, was I Made a Game with Zombies in It, with all the leet-speak in the title, was the best-selling indie game last year.
6031880	6033780	Apparently, it sold 160,000 units at $1 each.
6038228	6039929	Rumble Massage was the sixth best-selling game.
6068860	6071101	Avatar Drop sold $117,000 with $433,000 doing a trial.
6071161	6072222	Number 15, The Impossible Game moved 31,000 copies.
6090932	6092433	So that's at number 15.
6092513	6094093	Aquarium HD was number 10.
6094933	6096794	24,000 copies, 172,000 trials.
6097634	6098114	Interesting.
6098975	6102776	Sorry guys, Snake 360 is nowhere to be found.
6103216	6104817	Is Miner Dig Deep on there?
6106377	6106657	No.
6106937	6108038	I'm surprised.
6108058	6109038	Neither is Revenge of the Ball.
6109078	6110158	Oh no, Miner Dig Deep is there.
6110198	6110939	Sorry, number 5.
6111079	6113259	It just doesn't have actual figures.
6113460	6114400	That's a pretty good game.
6115000	6116320	It's addictive.
6117261	6117661	There you go.
6120074	6123416	If you haven't checked out any games, go download a handful.
6123436	6124436	There's some good stuff.
6124496	6126137	I think they really under-advertise it.
6126197	6128438	I mean, there's a ton of stuff on there.
6128638	6134662	And it's really hard to sort through it because of the new interface, which was supposed to be a good thing, and I don't like it.
6135702	6137183	So, anyhow.
6138664	6143926	I think this is the part of the show where we're going to get into some emails, although I don't know if we really have a lot of emails.
6143946	6146928	I think I heard there was one left over from last week that never got read.
6147288	6151016	I had, remember I had to delete all the spam and I think I got rid of some of them.
6151196	6151577	Whoops.
6151717	6156627	So if someone sent us email, just resend it to me and I'll redo it.
6157128	6158370	Alright, so we don't have email this week?
6159031	6159192	Yet.
6159847	6160087	Wow.
6160647	6164369	Well, I'll play the music and then end it because we have no emails.
6164669	6167971	So send us your emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6168031	6169772	Obviously, if you send them tonight, you're too late.
6170112	6171613	But do give us some emails for next week.
6171653	6173154	We'll be happy to take your questions.
6173714	6179837	And hopefully after the oopsies and whoops of the past couple weeks, we can get back on track with some more listener interaction.
6180637	6184620	So maybe the lack of emails due to spammers necessitates an F you.
6185141	6185901	F the spammers.
6186461	6187002	I hate spammers.
6187022	6188183	They hit our website too.
6188523	6189744	But I've gotten creative.
6190124	6196408	Like they keep spamming this thing on the forum about how to turn sub video on your iPod, all this crap.
6196709	6201692	What I did is I put in a custom filter that turns the name of the program into this program fucking sucks.
6202393	6206896	So every time they put a spam post, it just puts a link to this program fucking sucks.
6207856	6211099	And I'm going to continue to do that for all the programs that they spam on the board.
6211119	6212079	Because it's funny.
6212440	6217883	Even if it doesn't get them to stop, it's really funny that they're taking all this effort to announce to the world that their program fucking sucks.
6217903	6220265	And they always use names like, I'm a stupid spammer.
6221045	6221986	Oh yeah, I did that too.
6222646	6222927	Sorry.
6223407	6227049	I put in custom filters that say, punch me, I'm a stupid spammer.
6227490	6230271	I know they were doing that.
6230291	6231672	I was like, why would you do that?
6231692	6233053	That's stupid.
6233113	6235235	See, but it's funny that people are thinking that.
6235375	6236375	If you can't beat them,
6238243	6238763	Fuck with them.
6238884	6242567	You should just change all the words that they use, like hot dog and stuff.
6242587	6243367	Just make it weird.
6243607	6251794	Well, I can't change iPod because maybe people on the OLR forums want to have a legitimate discussion about iPod.
6252515	6252835	Shut up.
6253215	6262162	But this particular company, ain't no one give a shit about them, so I'm just going to change it to... I think the language is how to convert video.
6262282	6267787	If you use those words just like that, it changes to punch me, I'm a fucking spammer or something like that.
6269102	6269523	I'll do it.
6269543	6271104	I'll do it.
6291590	6292831	DarkSakura when it starts off tonight.
6317771	6321236	Um... I... Being busy.
6321516	6322497	F you for being busy.
6323479	6324140	That's about it.
6324898	6325679	I'm like...
6351138	6356980	God damn it, just have a button where I click it and it... Okay, look, Windows Media File, done.
6357340	6359320	Select the resolution, done.
6359380	6366902	I have a program that converts different video files for use with my PlayStation 3.
6366942	6366982	So...
6369183	6378451	That one, they either have the uber, okay, adjust all the settings type stuff, or you can just do the stupid simple, I want it to look good.
6378751	6380792	I want it to have good sound.
6380812	6385056	You just select good, very good, excellent, that type of stuff.
6385656	6387558	So why they can't do that is beyond me.
6387678	6394163	I have to actually create my own custom settings and save that profile so that I actually have one that works.
6395017	6395637	Really frustrated.
6396278	6399099	And I know auditions the same way because it's hard.
6399899	6400359	Photoshop.
6400680	6400900	Good.
6402240	6404021	Did you say Photoshop sucked earlier in the show?
6404181	6405342	No, I said Photoshop's good.
6405602	6408103	I said Photoshop on the iPhone probably sucked.
6408123	6409663	Okay, sorry.
6409743	6420848	Let's see, my FU of the week goes to... Actually, you know, a lot of things are going very well for me, so I can't complain, but just FU to that chaos feeling and uncertainty.
6420888	6423950	You know things are changing, but you don't know how they're changing.
6424850	6449669	and just the whole process of moving I hate packing and having to throw away things I don't need and the fact that I'm having to downsize from a house to an apartment again sucks but I'll get through it, I always do alright, couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line and hopefully very few audio problems tonight but we'll see what happens Loki, what you got for us?
6451398	6477930	let's see what we've got it's funny the last story it's actually a new game coming to the Nintendo Wii it's from Mistwalker and apparently the other game that we talked about this earlier this is on that list of titles that were to be announced and what not Xenoblade was the other one that's actually a game coming from the company let's see here
6478789	6488032	Oh, it's actually the localized name for Monado Beginning of the World, which is an RPG from Monolith Soft.
6488712	6493353	And then, of course, the last story is an RPG game being developed by Mistwalker.
6494514	6498775	And they didn't really say what it is, but it's a new form of RPG, they're calling it.
6499135	6500696	So, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.
6501736	6501816	Um...
6504056	6529106	and yeah and then the other thing of course Metroid Other M you know it's supposed to be coming out summer 2010 in Japan and what do all these have in common all of them have teaser sites now on Nintendo's Japanese website so you can go check those out as well so that's kind of neat so obviously they're coming relatively soon if they have their own teaser site all right there's been a lot of Nintendo news tonight
6530250	6531591	It's all kind of tying in together.
6531611	6532531	I guess so.
6532851	6533572	I don't know.
6533592	6537694	I think Nintendo's trying to put the cards together to really try to wow us again at E3 this year.
6537754	6539615	But on their hardware, I don't know.
6540055	6543617	But Mistwalker had some pretty good RPGs, at least Lost Odyssey.
6543677	6544778	Blue Dragon was kind of...
6545638	6546319	Ehh, for me.
6546479	6550843	I mean, it wasn't great, but I know Jamie really enjoyed it, so I guess they got some people with it.
6551904	6554466	Anyhow, I have one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
6554486	6559290	This has to do with Steam and some of the growth that Steam had in the year 2009.
6559350	6562413	Apparently, 25 million users now on Steam.
6562713	6563074	That's a 205% jump.
6565916	6572543	Over the year and year sales, and I wonder if this takes into account some of the Christmas sales, because they were having some obscene sales at the end of the year there.
6573684	6576707	And Valve put out a press release earlier in the week just talking about how great their 2009 was.
6576727	6578729	More than 25% new accounts, meaning they're up to $25 million.
6583032	6611148	10 million of those actually using profiles on Steam over a thousand games available on the service 100 different developers just crazy 5 years I guess the service is being used now they hit their peak in December 2.5 million concurrent users probably thanks to Modern Warfare 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 monthly average player minutes 13 billion so those saying the digital distribution didn't have a chance yeah
6612625	6638994	Steam's proving a lot of those wrong and I think again it's a lot of those just obscene sales that they have on Steam that really kind of pushes that up to the top and the fact that Valve's you know pretty respectable name in gaming you know the Half-Life games of course and you know Portal and Team Fortress and all that and all this that good stuff that was in the orange box you know and the fact that that software came with those games which were big PC games so
6640294	6641695	I would be curious, though.
6641855	6655543	I know this isn't going to really involve digital distribution on a wide scale, but I'm curious how the new Blizzard net software is going to, I don't want to say necessarily compete with Steam, but kind of like put a chunk in that whole concurrent users and stuff.
6655563	6661286	Because, you know, let's face it, I realize Steam might have 100 different developers, but Blizzard is like, they're like...
6662006	6666287	Kings of PC development between WoW, Diablo, StarCraft.
6666347	6672969	It's kind of hard to ignore the fact that Blizzard is a behemoth, and it's going to be interesting to see... They're a three-trick pony.
6673369	6675790	Well, apparently they're working on a new IP that we don't know about yet.
6675890	6676610	Four-trick pony.
6676670	6678610	But it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
6678850	6680411	Well, has Blizzard made a bad game?
6683372	6683692	Yes.
6683872	6684452	Chirp, chirp.
6684772	6687593	Maybe the Viking game, but even that was kind of neat.
6687933	6688153	So...
6689927	6705469	I don't know, we'll see I think in the end they're not really competition because I don't see Blizzard really selling all these different types of games but BlizzardNet, they already digitally distribute their own games and that's not to be ignored that's a huge chunk of PC market right there
6707552	6712536	Azam says, and digital distribution is tax-free as no physical material is exchanging hands to boot.
6712596	6712917	Crazy.
6713237	6718903	I don't know if you guys have done your taxes, though, but you know on the tax thing you're supposed to report anything you bought that was out of state?
6720564	6721625	Yeah, I don't think so.
6723067	6724248	Prove they bought it out of state.
6724908	6744367	I would you know I think if maybe I bought a car out of state or like major purchases I'd probably report those because you know that's the ethical thing to do and I don't want to get caught but like 20 bucks on a game I can't keep track of that throughout the year come on if you want to charge me taxes on it you need to do it at the point of sale like some other states do so all right
6744912	6748136	And by the way, some folks in chat saying Lost Vikings is good.
6748636	6750579	Rock and Roll Racing for the SNES was by Blizzard.
6750599	6752160	That was from VidPower and GameGuru.
6752661	6756806	And Rob D says, hey, if that was the only one that wasn't a good game, Blizzard's in good shape.
6757026	6757386	I agree.
6757987	6758447	There you go.
6759989	6763954	All right, you guys ready to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6763974	6765476	Use the name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
6766296	6768177	Again, I don't know how this is going to work tonight.
6768317	6773300	I'm hoping the audio problems are okay and we don't have a lot of them.
6773760	6776682	Our phone call with Bobby went okay, so hopefully Skype goes okay too.
6776742	6777862	We have a call on the line.
6777922	6778883	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6778903	6779243	Who's this?
6780063	6781244	Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.
6781544	6781924	Hi, Ray.
6781944	6782445	How are you doing?
6783445	6783965	I'm all right.
6784566	6785266	What's on your mind tonight?
6785866	6792370	I've been meaning to call about this for a few weeks now, but haven't been able to because I missed episodes.
6793430	6794311	We had some drama.
6794431	6794691	What's up?
6795843	6802469	Um, DJMAX Technica Platinum Crew Service is finally online, like, internationally, not just in a few countries.
6802709	6806332	That's right, because you can download it now on the PSN, right?
6807373	6814238	Uh, no, I'm talking about the server, the online service for arcade DJMAX Technica machines.
6814479	6816320	Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, gotcha, yeah.
6817441	6824587	So, for those who haven't heard of it, it's kind of like Konami's EMU system, only it actually happened outside of Japan.
6825709	6834512	And what you can do is go to the special mode where you can do these missions to unlock new charts and songs.
6835092	6845136	There's also some special super hard charts you can try, as well as some courses you can do where you try to compete for the best score.
6845196	6851558	And then when you go online on your PC or your iPhone or whatever, you can check your scores and whatnot.
6853922	6855683	Is this really taking off in arcades, though?
6855783	6859625	Because, you know, it would seem like this is kind of an expensive thing for arcades to set up.
6859725	6862206	Are they actually kind of welcoming of this?
6863627	6866408	So far, I think so.
6868129	6879015	Like, the first week I was there, like, there were pretty huge lines for the Technica machine, like, at Sunnyvale Golf Line, like, as many as 10 to 15 people, which isn't really a mine.
6879055	6881816	I can understand, like, the excitement for it and such.
6884446	6888170	It's kind of sad how arcades outside Japan are doing.
6888210	6888350	I mean...
6907469	6922994	I believe a number of factors on this, like for example, arcades not maintaining their machines or American arcade developers not taking the arcade scene seriously, like choosing to make novelty games rather than games that you can play for quite a while.
6923754	6931677	Like, Raw Thrills, for example, a lot of their games are the kind of games that you would play just for novelty a few times, not really take seriously.
6934557	6943860	Well, speaking of this whole DJ Max thing, because I referenced this a minute ago, but now it's available on PlayStation Network to download right to your PSP.
6943900	6944340	What do you think?
6944941	6959866	That would be DJ Max fever, and I've heard they fixed a few things, but I'm still not getting it because there's one annoying feature that they didn't take out that would have made me buy it, and that's the author-correct feature.
6960826	6961026	Hmm.
6964000	6986061	I'm looking in chat, SSJ100Man on our chat says they had this whole system set up at 8 on the break That's that popular arcade in Jersey and it was an hour wait to play Yeah, that sounds like Swiggle too Wow, I should check and see if the Roseville Golf Land here got it I don't even know, I haven't been there in six months, kind of too bad Well, alright, Ray, is there anything else you want to ask us about tonight?
6987305	6988205	Eh, not the moment.
6988225	6988546	Yeah.
6988566	6988666	Yeah.
7015575	7018896	Speaking of which, I actually bought some stuff to upgrade my arcade cabinet at home.
7018936	7025599	I bought a new GeForce graphics card because before I had what they call an arcade VGA card.
7025639	7031001	It's basically a hacked ATI card that's pretty old with some different drivers and stuff.
7031021	7040624	But you can do the same 15-kilogram drivers to output to the arcade monitor with a software program.
7040644	7041785	You can run any card with that.
7042345	7052530	So now I can run, you know, hopefully since BlazBlue's continuum shift leaked to the internet, I'm going to run that on my cabinet too.
7053031	7054571	Clearly we have a caller on the line.
7054611	7055212	Hi, who's there?
7056172	7057133	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
7057313	7058253	Hi, Zaku.
7058293	7058894	How are you doing?
7059594	7062516	Yeah, I just want to say congratulations on the new year.
7062536	7068639	I managed to make a good, almost like what, almost like eight years in running so far.
7069443	7073345	Yeah, we're now into, we've now spanned two decades, this show.
7073845	7075906	Yeah, we started, what was the first show, 2002?
7077026	7078687	June 23rd of 02, right?
7079087	7079868	Wow, you're close.
7080228	7081848	You're close to an eight year anniversary show.
7082509	7083009	Don't remind me.
7084210	7084790	Well, what's on your mind?
7085770	7086611	Ah, nothing much.
7086691	7088692	Just wanted to... Let me see.
7089393	7092475	The truth of the matter is, you heard about the iPad, right?
7092515	7095317	And how some of them are just like... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
7095717	7096798	What's an iPad?
7097438	7097938	No, I'm kidding.
7097998	7098359	I'm sorry.
7099519	7101100	Yes, we heard about the iPad.
7102261	7109586	I mean, the way I see it right now, I don't know why they had to make the iPod Touch or iPhone much bigger.
7110126	7112068	I guess it's because Apple's trying to...
7113544	7113864	I don't know.
7113885	7118269	Some of them were just saying the other day that it might actually be a game for Sony.
7118309	7120251	I actually picked this one up on Kotaku earlier today.
7135475	7139918	Where the iPad itself would actually increase Do you type with your fists?
7140379	7150586	Like, the clacking of the keys is so loud It's my Mac, alright Oh, okay, that explains it My MacBook, alright Nevermind, okay, that explains it Is it just me?
7150666	7162996	It sounds like he's beating the keyboard with his fists But it's like typing Because these are the chiclet keys They look exactly like that, but Let me see Yeah, Sony's pleased as much with Apple's iPad
7164011	7192442	something along that lines let's see you see Nintendo basically you know basically panning the iPad I don't know when you joined the show we covered that in part A towards the top of the show yeah we talked about Iwata basically saying what the rest of us were thinking that the iPad is basically several eye touches glued together well it's basically the point where Steve Jobs literally jumped the shark and just trying to go after trying to go after everything when he's not you know
7193328	7201979	I mean, I can understand that the iPhone and the iPod Touch managed to build itself up to a gaming platform, even though it was never its true intention.
7203541	7204762	Well, here's the thing.
7204922	7212652	The iPad only needed a couple of really great things, and I think very clearly distinguishable things from the iPhone.
7212972	7215193	that would have made people jump all over it.
7215313	7224036	And I think one of them is if they put a camera in the front of it so you could video conference from anywhere, I think a lot of people would have ate that shit up right away.
7224176	7225136	I think that would have been amazing.
7225496	7227857	And I think the other thing is multitasking.
7227937	7234340	I mean, they go out and say, yippee, skippy, we've got a gigahertz processor in here, but you can't really surf the web.
7234360	7235780	That was a disappointment.
7235920	7236960	The only thing it is is just a...
7238914	7241015	An oversized iPhone.
7241755	7243936	Minus the voice.
7244176	7245496	Sorry, I like this comment from chat.
7245536	7250118	Decipher says, did Jobs give a thumbs up and say, hey, while jumping over the said shark?
7250818	7251618	We'll imagine that he did.
7254079	7259061	Since I know you're big on the mobile gaming and everything, do you think the gaming is going to take off on this platform?
7259101	7265343	I mean, we already heard about how it's going to be able to play all the existing iPhone games, but you blow them up to scale or whatever.
7265603	7281474	It should be backwards compatible with the other ones, but then you have to realize some other... You saw that actual, you know, the day they actually revealed the iPad and they had like, I think it was Gameloft that had the first person shooter tech demo that they had up there.
7283297	7287098	It looked pretty damn good for something that small.
7287318	7294660	But Zaku, do you think there's going to be a lot of people that are that excited about the iPad where developers are going to be jumping to the bit to develop for it?
7294680	7298421	That depends on how much of an install base we're talking about with the iPad.
7298521	7303382	Whether or not the iPad itself would have the same numbers as the iPod Touch and the iPhone.
7303523	7308744	If there's a huge install base, then that's a pretty big market to actually make games on.
7309468	7312730	The other thing is developers have to take advantage of the platform completely.
7313371	7323297	They can't just Mickey Mouse their way onto that platform with shitty titles.
7323698	7331183	They have to really find a way to exploit the platform's potential.
7332704	7338388	There's a lot of strengths in that platform in terms of multi-touch and the accelerometer.
7339386	7346173	Surely they could think of something that could utilize both if not all the aspects of the device.
7347731	7352052	You know, I think, though, it's important to remember that Apple loves to reinvent their shit.
7352132	7356153	And I think, honestly, I think in a year's time, I think the iPad's going to get a lot better.
7356213	7356974	Let's not forget.
7358154	7358994	Good God.
7359094	7360995	It's like he's shooting a gun at his keyboard.
7363275	7364236	It sounds like whack-a-mole.
7364356	7364716	It does.
7364736	7366616	It sounds like you have a Chuck E. Cheese there.
7367537	7367797	All right.
7368717	7369097	Here's the thing.
7369137	7372158	I think in a year's time, when that thing gets redeveloped, it's going to be great.
7372198	7376359	Because let's not forget, the iPhone did not have the App Store when it first launched.
7376499	7391049	Right, and that was like several months and that was basically Steve Jobs coming to his senses and realizing that you can't just have everything web-based when that whole web-based platform is basically a bottleneck.
7391089	7396733	It's not a robust solution for what you could actually do natively on that phone.
7397193	7400996	Alright, Zach, we're going to let you go so you can go play more Whack-A-Mole, but thanks for the call, okay?
7401496	7402237	Alright, have a good one.
7402257	7404018	Type a little bit more for us so we can hear it a little more.
7412929	7422155	We need to have like a loudest keyboard competition here at Orange Lounge Radio in honor of the new soundboard helping us with alleviating the Jamie typing during the show noises.
7423096	7424957	We need to have a loudest keyboard competition.
7426378	7427298	I don't type that loudly.
7427559	7428979	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7429019	7429500	Who's this?
7430140	7431341	It's Brad from PodCulture.
7431461	7432842	Hey, Brad from PodCulture.
7432902	7434003	Wait, hold that thought for a minute.
7434283	7434823	You're right, Jamie.
7434843	7437105	You don't type with your fists, but you have to admit...
7438695	7439795	Okay, Brad, what's up?
7439855	7440316	How you doing?
7441076	7442637	I'm doing fine, guys.
7443957	7444797	What's on your mind?
7446758	7447978	Star Trek Online, man.
7448279	7449279	Oh, Star Trek Online.
7449319	7450900	I know you've been all over this game.
7450940	7454281	Congratulations on having a computer good enough to play it, for starters.
7454861	7460623	The computer itself isn't that old, or isn't that high-end.
7461363	7462404	A lot of RAM and a...
7463274	7464675	Video card that was donated to us.
7465135	7465996	It's the video card.
7466016	7469158	The video card is so key I think for this game and well any game really.
7469558	7472520	But tell us a little bit about your experience as a Star Trek online.
7472560	7473320	How's it been going for you?
7474481	7475821	When I can log in, it's great.
7478083	7488829	I guess with the beta and stuff I had some problems at first logging in and staying in and then they had one huge, almost a gig patch that seemed to smooth everything out.
7488869	7490050	That took forever, didn't it?
7490635	7492816	No, kidding.
7493396	7496317	Also, were you there for when the beta closed?
7496837	7499658	Oh yeah, I was on the Starbase getting my ass kicked by Borg.
7500118	7501138	Okay, so how cool was it?
7502618	7506119	It was ridiculously cool because it was hopeless.
7506139	7508160	There's nothing you could do to win.
7508400	7510981	Did the Borg come out and say, you will die?
7512081	7518003	When you hear the Borg, you can actually hear the big mass voice of them talking.
7518043	7518423	It's pretty cool.
7518973	7522755	Yeah, the first training mission with the older Borg was pretty damn cool.
7525417	7526537	So that's how they ended the beta?
7526577	7527858	They just had a big Borg invasion?
7528038	7528158	Yep.
7528178	7530920	Oh, it was Borg, Klingon, every damn...
7532626	7534067	Race Attack, and it was awesome.
7534287	7534527	Nice.
7534547	7538170	That sounds very Ragnarok of the developers to do.
7538290	7542172	It's kind of a geek Ragnarok, yeah.
7542412	7549377	In Ragnarok, they used to just do random raids on the town by all the critters.
7552679	7554460	Did you go ahead and remake your character?
7554981	7555261	Oh, yeah.
7555801	7556982	I'm doing that tonight.
7557242	7558543	I'm almost back to where I was.
7560462	7561603	Oh my gosh, that's impressive.
7561644	7564106	I'm totally going to have a character permanently living on DS9.
7564146	7564486	I don't care.
7566368	7570373	During the beta, I flew my ship out there, and it looks pretty damn slick.
7570913	7571414	No quark!
7572975	7575638	It's, what, 38 years or something like that?
7575978	7577380	He still needs to make money.
7577880	7580323	He's got his own moon now, and his brother's in Nagus.
7581347	7582948	You gotta wait for the expansion.
7583008	7587629	There's gonna be an inevitable expansion pack, and that's where the fan service will really start getting delivered.
7587649	7588449	They'll put Khan.
7588469	7589909	You'll be able to fight Khan or something.
7589949	7593170	No, he's probably long since... He died, Rob!
7593530	7595691	This is Star Trek Online in the alternate universe, though?
7595791	7595931	No.
7596471	7597171	Oh, okay.
7597251	7601893	It takes place from that point, the big event where the two universes split.
7602753	7606794	It goes forward from, quote, our prime timeline forward.
7608163	7609244	Now I've gone cross-eyed.
7610825	7611486	It'll do that.
7611986	7615109	I will say this is the first game that's actually got me to play an MMO.
7615849	7617411	I quit World of Warcraft for this.
7618491	7619152	Well, this is better.
7619852	7620613	Hell yeah.
7621894	7626518	Except I totally, totally hate the targeting system.
7628794	7630716	More like ship navigation in combat.
7630796	7637023	Or the fact that having never really played much in PC gaming, period, if I just suck, which I do.
7637384	7638285	No, it's not you.
7639145	7642029	It's just the control, and the walking controls are oversensitive.
7643811	7644431	A little bit, yeah.
7644692	7646834	Yeah, I mean, like, it's really easy to run into a wall.
7648991	7650934	Well Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun on Star Trek Online.
7650954	7660227	I know there's been talk about an OLR fleet, but since I'm not really playing the game until I get a better computer, that's going to be all Jamie to put together, her OLR-ian race and all that.
7660267	7663692	So Jamie, you're going to have to get on the forums and tell people how to join up with you.
7663712	7664533	Screw that, I'm playing a trill.
7665634	7665974	Whatever.
7666996	7669178	Well, he did say join up.
7669599	7672102	I tried to make a couple of Olarians.
7672122	7675305	They're not very orange, although I did make a really cool chick.
7675586	7676066	I'll tell you what.
7676967	7682834	I'll put up some of my experimental pictures in the chat room of some of the things I've made because I saved screen caps.
7684995	7686576	This is what I want you to do.
7687296	7695438	If anyone wants to contribute to the Olarians, I want pictures of your creation screen with the face dimensions.
7695578	7697278	With what you've done to make one.
7698279	7699439	That's what I want to see.
7699559	7701600	Hopefully we'll get some forum chat.
7702400	7704180	Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun with Star Trek Online.
7704220	7705761	Hopefully I'll be joining you in a few months.
7705941	7711082	I want to ask you real quick though, because I know you're a big fan of this too and one of your other shows is about Dollhouse.
7711702	7712002	Oh yeah.
7712062	7715225	If I'm not mistaken, Dollhouse had its final episode this past week.
7715565	7716086	How was it?
7716686	7721330	It was... It was a different kind of episode.
7721970	7726594	It was almost a sequel to the season one ender, Epitaph One.
7727615	7728716	And it was pretty good.
7729776	7730877	It was pretty good overall.
7730917	7737863	It was... It's one of those things that you could tell that they had a rush.
7737923	7740245	The last few episodes, actually, they crammed like...
7741021	7743062	Two seasons worth into four episodes.
7744443	7745023	That's too bad.
7745083	7749005	Any word about what Joss Whedon's up to next, besides directing an episode of Glee, apparently?
7749745	7757888	Well, apparently he's got battered wife syndrome or something because he's in talks with FX, which is pretty much Fox, about doing something.
7759649	7761270	And then, of course, there's always Dr. Horrible 2.
7763831	7764891	Oh, Dr. Horrible 2.
7765112	7765932	Excellent, excellent.
7766331	7769672	Alright, well, Brad, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for your call, okay?
7770292	7770873	Alrighty, guys.
7771033	7773334	Have fun, and the new board is sounding really good.
7773454	7774274	Thank you so much.
7774314	7775014	We're happy to have it.
7775054	7777855	Now, if only we could get all the computer stuff side-fixed, but we'll get it.
7778775	7779436	Alright, later, Brad.
7779876	7780356	Later, guys.
7780536	7784137	PodCulture.net if you want to hear more of Brad and his sci-fi geekdom.
7784157	7790020	And if you liked our little Doctor Who talk earlier, or I should say DarkSakura's little Doctor Who talk earlier, like, that's Brad's show.
7791460	7793301	That's where they live there.
7793862	7797144	They'll debate whether 10th Doctor was better or 4th Doctor was darker.
7797164	7798204	They'll debate that all day long.
7799305	7800366	By the way, one thing to mention.
7800506	7804208	If anyone else is playing Star Trek Online, you can add me to your friends list.
7804248	7809952	I'm in there as DarkSakura with the space in between the two on the Star Trek Online page.
7810332	7811153	Alright, we got another call.
7811193	7812013	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7812033	7812354	Who's this?
7813614	7815636	Good evening, you across the ocean.
7816116	7817097	How are you, my friend?
7818137	7823022	This is Akeriper, as well as new listeners.
7823042	7824203	What the fuck?
7824403	7824844	I will help.
7825244	7826845	Oh well, anyway, good evening.
7827126	7827666	Good evening.
7828627	7832191	Or good morning, if you are to be incorrect or something.
7834353	7838237	Actually, it's like half past five.
7838957	7840579	It's five in the morning where you are?
7841590	7843594	Yeah, it's 5.35.
7843694	7847481	I feel so bad we weren't able to do the early show, but, you know, shit happens.
7847501	7847902	What can we do?
7847922	7849666	The thing is that, well, yeah...
7853381	7872670	I was almost about to actually miss it, since I was just shaking around a bit, and then I just found out, oh yeah, this supposed show is like now, but I haven't slept that much, so, oh well, what the hell, I'll see if it happens, but it didn't, so, well.
7873550	7876092	Well, what's on your mind tonight, Aki Ripper?
7877376	7883981	Um, well, um, Mass Effect 2 is an awesome game.
7884321	7885002	Of course.
7885602	7888865	We haven't mentioned anything about Mass Effect 2, but that was a huge release this week.
7888925	7893028	I know it's been getting a lot of, like, especially folks that just loved the first one are all about this game.
7893468	7895510	Tell us a little bit about your experience with Mass Effect 2.
7896856	7901480	Um, I've, uh, well, uh, I, uh, well, what can I say?
7901640	7903682	I'm an impatient fuck, so to say.
7904382	7922498	I should really be, like, and I'm, uh, and I'm, like, in a kind of way, uh, almost, but still not, uh, doing that, since, well, the whole story is that I got the, uh, cracked, the, got the pirated version of it, and played it all through, and
7923727	7933712	And then I tried to install my retail copy, and my retail copy will not work for some strange reason.
7936154	7951922	But here's the other thing, is that since I'm still running the Windows 7 beta, which runs out of time pretty soon, it doesn't annoy me that much, so to say.
7954059	7956241	But how is Mass Effect?
7956261	7958103	Because I'm not as up and up on Mass Effect.
7958143	7963307	I watched a friend play it once for a little while, and obviously I've heard it's a Bioware RPG, it's awesome.
7963467	7964948	What are some of the differences between 1 and 2?
7965388	7968011	Or is it really just like a continuation of one story?
7969051	7979620	The whole difference between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 is really the combat is way much better.
7981612	8002146	Way, way, uh, much better since, well, um, it annoys me really at first because, well, uh, I'm not, because basically they, I, I felt like they've turned like Mass Effect into Gears of War, which is, well, you run for cover and cover, cover, and, uh, well, you shoot for it, shoot from cover.
8003147	8010412	And that was a mechanic that I didn't at first like really at all.
8011519	8020502	But, well, after a while I got used to it, and then I've just been reminded, yeah, what's the difference between this and Gears of War?
8020842	8036286	Well, here you actually have a health bar, or shield meters, and you can actually rush people, kill them up front, and...
8038107	8041579	and in Mass Effect 2, I don't die after like five minutes.
8044696	8048419	Well, good, because I'm totally the type of bonsai kind of player where I just run out.
8050240	8052922	I'm not very good with covering that, so excellent.
8053363	8060228	Well, IKripper, I want to wrap up real quick and get to some other calls, but quickly, what are some other games you're looking forward to in the next couple weeks?
8061789	8062529	Bioshock 2.
8062770	8064991	Oh, another great one.
8065692	8069074	Yeah, but these... And that's the...
8071374	8074436	That's the only game I have room for in my budget.
8076058	8080461	But here's the other thing.
8080601	8086926	For both Mass Effect 2 and Bioshock 2, I've went and got the collector's one.
8088047	8098115	Especially the Bioshock one is really interesting because you get the soundtrack that you get in the special one is the
8099075	8102476	Record, that authentic record, apparently.
8103417	8113700	Which is, like, that's like a few nerd bonuses from me, which makes it like insta-buy.
8115361	8116541	So, I will...
8117193	8117493	All right.
8117853	8121595	Well, I gotta let you go to get some more calls, but have fun with your collector's edition.
8121635	8121975	Enjoy.
8122795	8122975	Yeah.
8123215	8123495	All right.
8123815	8124076	Later.
8124916	8128037	And thanks for staying up or getting up earlier, staying up late.
8128057	8130578	Now, you know he's staying up late to listen to the program.
8130598	8132679	That's an awesome commitment for you guys overseas.
8133739	8134039	Love it.
8135780	8136140	Why not?
8136220	8137980	We can do some more calls.
8138000	8138720	877-GAME-OLR.
8138821	8140781	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8141001	8148983	And I'm just having fun hearing some of these people through the new computer because now that we kind of had to reconfigure our sound, it's actually helping the calls a lot.
8149524	8150964	I'm actually kind of impressed.
8152574	8154035	We should have done this like three years ago.
8155095	8156275	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8156295	8156695	Who's this?
8157296	8158216	Hey, this is X-Link.
8158336	8158936	Hey, X-Link.
8158976	8159476	How you doing?
8159837	8160517	Hey, doing good.
8160537	8162558	I have a few things I'd like to talk about real quick.
8162718	8163518	Well, I suppose.
8165298	8165839	The iPad.
8165859	8173541	The only good thing I can see about that is maybe playing desktop version of D&D, making it more better, enhancing it a little bit.
8173701	8177143	That's the only cool thing I could possibly see ever coming out of that thing for $500.
8178223	8183749	Funny enough, another giant, I mean, not a tablet so much, but that table, the Surface.
8183969	8190096	I remember a story we had a couple months ago, maybe like last month, about a big D&D game that was on the Surface.
8190316	8194220	I know it was supposed to be kind of really innovative for that platform.
8194280	8198404	So that's an interesting way of thinking is the iPad as a D&D device.
8198905	8199546	I could see that.
8200226	8200587	Correct.
8201347	8213531	Mass Effect had a big patch about two months ago for the first game that they took a lot of the issues that they were having, like in the screens where there was dialogue, where it was spoken, a lot of times it would skip.
8213571	8220674	They cleared a lot of that up, which was really helpful and made the gameplay a lot better, a lot more smooth than it was before.
8222755	8237642	and then on Mass Effect 2 I'm hearing they're taking a lot of the took a lot of the gameplay and a lot of the stuff for like the experience for how when you level up a character and made it more easier and the interface more easier than what's beforehand hmm so that was very interesting
8237955	8239836	I'm going to have to check these games out at some point.
8239856	8241937	There's too many games to play, especially now.
8242037	8244377	Usually we're not saying this in January, February.
8244457	8247098	It's insane what the release calendar looks like.
8247118	8248979	I'm starting to wonder what's left for Christmas.
8250200	8250440	Really?
8250460	8260544	Well, it's hard for me because I work, and then I do my online schooling, and then between that and trying to level my character in WoW still, it's kind of hard to go back and forth.
8260604	8260884	Yeah.
8262786	8273845	I just now got to like 9 hours of Mass Effect 1 for the PC which I'm really enjoying a lot Weren't you telling me on Warcraft that you bought that on some Steam sale or something?
8274528	8277891	No, I bought a few other things on Steam, but that wasn't one of them.
8277971	8283735	Actually, I bought that one at a store for $15, $10 when it was on sale.
8283935	8284416	Nice.
8285096	8286918	Yeah, it was a real good value for it.
8287158	8288739	I can't remember what I bought.
8289560	8292682	Now I'm going to go back and try to remind myself what I bought last from Steam.
8293763	8296005	But it's been a while since I bought something from there.
8296805	8299787	Usually I get most of my stuff while it was on sale during that Christmas time, but...
8302934	8306115	I have a question for Loki though.
8306175	8309436	I was planning on trying down the road here getting an Xbox 360.
8309496	8313137	Which system would be the best for my value?
8313837	8316978	They're all about the same because it's really just what size hard drive you want.
8317478	8319939	So probably just...
8321798	8324821	Elite Elite Elite Elite Elite
8338934	8340556	Oh, it's just the Elite and the Core now?
8340936	8342477	Then you need to just get the Elite, I think.
8342818	8349003	The Arcade is good for replacing a dead 360, which is what I just did, or people that really don't play console games a lot.
8349023	8351585	But if you're going to play your games... Think about it.
8351645	8357631	If you get an Arcade unit and you want to play 1 versus 100, you have no place to store the game because you have to download it from the server.
8357931	8359172	So you're going to need a hard drive.
8359532	8362014	And by the way, it's very interesting.
8362215	8365858	I mean, something that I don't hear enough people question...
8367236	8368617	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8384910	8387811	without any type of wireless adapter built in.
8387831	8390932	They don't put the component cable in with the Sony systems either.
8391092	8391912	Okay, fair enough.
8391932	8392572	Then I'll give you that one.
8392592	8397634	But without a wireless adapter where Sony has that built in, yes, and Microsoft wants $100 for theirs.
8397654	8399775	But some people don't need that, and so why pay the extra money for it?
8399815	8407717	I'm just saying it's not brought up enough that what's the value you're getting, especially now that the PS3 is $299.
8409017	8410958	They're about equal now, I think.
8411818	8412799	So something to think about.
8412959	8413479	Anyway, sorry.
8413499	8413599	Yeah.
8415460	8416581	Really quickly, I'll let you go.
8417102	8420164	The Battle.net, you were asking about that.
8420845	8431334	I actually own a copy of Warcraft 3 with the expansion, and the funny thing about that is when I registered that onto it, I can now download that anytime I want through them.
8432015	8437900	Which is good, because if I ever lose a disc, or the disc gets lost when I move from place to place, or it gets broken or something...
8438501	8450122	It's good enough to know that I can log on to that site and re-download the game and not worry about, you know, have to go out and spend another 30, 40 bucks or 20 bucks or whatever to replace the game.
8450899	8460221	Absolutely, I'm trying to find my old Diablo 2 key for the same reason, because I want to play that again, and I know I can download it, but I can't find my old CD, the game's just so freaking old.
8460762	8470744	But what's cool about it, if you put the CD key into the battle.net, it will not only appear on your screen like it does with Warcraft and everything, but also it will let you download it.
8470764	8475005	Like, if you click on the game, you can download the game onto your computer.
8475145	8475626	Very cool.
8476226	8477146	So that's very plus.
8477646	8481751	X-Link, we're going to wrap up and let you go so we can try and squeeze a couple more calls in, but thank you so much, okay?
8481871	8483292	Take care, buddy.
8483312	8486316	877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8486356	8489920	We'll see if any more calls come in, but I'll let Loki start some last-minute news.
8491432	8494934	I'm assuming Jamie doesn't have anything, but I don't know if you have anything, Jamie.
8495234	8496234	Way to assume, Rob.
8496454	8496995	I'm just saying.
8497015	8497555	I don't have anything.
8497735	8498395	Aha, I was right.
8499136	8503638	There's more Who coming to the Rock Band marketplace.
8504158	8508660	Apparently some more tracks are going to be coming on February 7th, according to an advertisement.
8508900	8513082	It looks like, oh, that's in Rock Band?
8513102	8514583	I don't know.
8514723	8517664	It's some digital advertisement, but that's kind of neat.
8517824	8518684	We got another call coming in.
8518704	8519645	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8519665	8519945	Who's this?
8520987	8521767	Hey, it's Sterlok.
8521987	8522608	Hi, Sterlok.
8522628	8523168	What's on your mind?
8524088	8524689	Eh, not much.
8524709	8530331	I wanted to let you guys know about something cool I found a few weeks ago.
8530651	8531532	We like cool stuff.
8531592	8531912	What's up?
8533332	8538635	Well, remember the FC Mobile, which was the portable NES?
8538935	8539515	Yes, I do.
8539815	8541796	I got that as a Christmas present, which was amazing.
8541956	8542536	I have one too.
8543697	8546898	Well, now there is a portable Super Nintendo.
8547218	8548739	It's done by a really crappy company.
8549386	8553308	Yeah, it kind of is, but it's not that bad.
8554068	8560831	Does this mean the patents are up on the Super Nintendo technology or something, where now we're going to start seeing all these bootleg Super Nintendos come out?
8562112	8562672	I guess so.
8562692	8564493	I guess we're going to be seeing more of these.
8564853	8568314	So maybe this is the first one out the gate, but that means there might be some more of these in the future.
8568614	8573297	Well, tell us a little more about the system, because even though Jamie's heard of it, I have not.
8574237	8575177	Well, it's called the FC-16 Go.
8575197	8575237	Um...
8579355	8593380	and yeah, it's done by Yobo who did the FC Twin and like the FC3 and I don't know, they're not the greatest but the Super Nintendo end seems to be kind of improved in this.
8595140	8596061	It does play Star Fox.
8596881	8597521	Oh my gosh.
8598402	8598722	Nice.
8599642	8600162	Wow.
8601283	8607165	My only real complaint about it is the headphone jack is retarded.
8607925	8608145	Like
8608530	8614975	The headphone jack is not your standard, you know, three and a half millimeter, you know, whatever.
8615716	8621180	It's 2.5, which is, you know, like what you would see like in a cell phone headset.
8621420	8621940	That's weird.
8621960	8626084	Do you think that might be a region thing because cell phones are so prevalent in the other countries?
8626184	8630627	Maybe where this is really... I don't... I mean, I solved that problem.
8630667	8632429	I just got an adapter and that was that.
8633349	8634770	That's what Radio Shacks are really good for.
8634790	8636212	I need an adapter.
8636232	8636412	Yeah.
8637182	8637762	Yeah, exactly.
8638263	8641105	But yeah, I haven't found anything that doesn't work on it.
8642225	8643206	Well, that's pretty cool.
8643286	8646228	I guess Super Mario RPG probably doesn't work.
8646288	8647829	I don't know because I don't have the game.
8648049	8657115	Is it the same type of thing like the FC Mobile where it's kind of like you can have it on a little portable system or you can hook it into the TV and do it that way?
8657695	8661799	Yep, it is, and it comes with two wireless controllers also.
8662279	8662920	Oh, wow.
8663060	8664762	And the controllers are actually pretty good.
8664882	8665602	Drool.
8666623	8670587	I'm very excited at the idea, because Super Nintendo, I'm sorry, is the best console they ever put out.
8670907	8673850	I don't think they'll ever put out a console that good ever again.
8674530	8679635	Just being able to play some of these games like Kid Icarus, or not Kid Icarus, I was going to say Super Metroid, and
8680395	8705545	I wish the hypothetical Super Nintendo Kid Icarus game in my head an Actraiser in Final Fantasy 3 6, whatever you want to call it which does work on it with the PC Engine Duo that wasn't even released in the US so I have no memories of that sorry, it's got some of the best games ever which was kind of a bastardized Rondo of Blood pretty much alright, well Sterlok, anything else on your mind buddy?
8706924	8707444	No, that was it.
8707805	8708065	All right.
8708105	8712511	Well, thank you so much for the call, and have fun with that FC-16 device.
8712631	8713553	Yeah, it's pretty fun.
8713613	8716436	I'm going to look into it, but I'm going to wait and see what kind of competition comes out.
8716717	8717037	We'll see.
8717218	8717438	Yeah.
8717718	8718960	I'm sure there will be other things.
8719220	8719481	All right.
8719601	8720061	Take care, buddy.
8720662	8720862	See you.
8721983	8725144	GameGuru says, expect the FC64 to come soon.
8725184	8725604	Who knows?
8725824	8728424	It sounds like it's about, what, 20 years on the patents or something?
8728484	8734586	I don't know exactly how that all works, but it's going to be interesting when the ones on the PlayStation and so forth are up.
8734966	8736406	I'm really curious to see what happens there.
8737606	8740587	Decipher in chat says, I want a portable N64 so bad.
8741007	8742087	Go buy a Nintendo DS.
8742587	8743068	Seriously?
8743168	8744028	That's what they pretty much are.
8744348	8747268	Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories while we see if any other calls come in?
8748329	8749529	Yeah, let's see.
8750711	8751532	We've got a call coming in.
8751552	8751792	Hold on.
8753514	8754715	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8754735	8755135	Who's this?
8755816	8756937	Hello, it's Salacious Pop.
8757398	8758358	Hi, how are you?
8759079	8759460	I'm good.
8759520	8759940	How are you?
8760200	8761001	I'm great.
8762122	8767207	For those listeners that don't know, Salacious Pop, you know this show pretty well, right?
8767948	8769249	Yeah, I've been listening since about September.
8769469	8773173	Yeah, and is there any type of a special relationship you have to this program?
8774136	8775980	Yeah, I might be going out with one of the hosts.
8778084	8778645	Get a room!
8779186	8779666	Yeah.
8780087	8784035	Shermie and I, we just, you know... It's kiddie love.
8784580	8784820	Lots of...
8811860	8814963	Flapping hands and flailing, it was very chaotic and stressful.
8815344	8819728	I know, and you're probably just kind of watching going, just like Shermie, kind of watching going, what?
8821010	8824974	Yeah, it was my fault that I was there.
8825034	8829479	I did 9-11, and I caused all that cancer, and then I set up the bomb for all our...
8830707	8832868	To all the UK listeners, I'm sorry.
8833108	8834709	My presence there sort of cursed the machine.
8835189	8836989	They have a new system now.
8837349	8839630	I see.
8839670	8841851	To what do we owe your phone call tonight?
8843011	8849934	I was just being silly and wanted to say hello and say that I'm really looking forward to eventually being a guest.
8851294	8853775	Maybe this room will be less chaotic next time you're here.
8854055	8854575	Let's hope.
8854755	8855095	I don't know.
8855115	8856096	Tonight was pretty bad.
8856496	8859817	The only difference between what you saw and tonight is that we actually had a show tonight.
8861226	8862347	We've got a bigger mess in here now.
8862367	8863528	But there was lots of flailing.
8864228	8864408	Yes.
8865089	8865769	There really was.
8866410	8868311	Well, what about this week's news?
8869112	8872014	I know you've got something to say about some of these topics going on here.
8872234	8876877	You were the one that gave me the Steam story.
8877998	8886144	Most of my internet trolling for news has involved just wank about the iPad, which I know that everyone's gone over about a million times on tonight's show.
8886685	8887885	But just that it's not very good.
8891162	8897167	As a huge Half-Life fan, I was upset that Black Mesa Source was bumped until this year, but that's like a month-old story.
8897908	8903392	They were supposed to release their remake of Half-Life 1 by the end of last year, and it didn't happen.
8904172	8908636	I remember hearing something about that, and I remember you were kind of upset about that, because I know you're a big Half-Life fan.
8909156	8910117	Whatever happened to Episode 3?
8910477	8911618	That's the other big question, right?
8912399	8915041	Damn them!
8915401	8918904	It's probably going to be so big that they're just going to throw it into Half-Life 3.
8919682	8921042	I don't really need to.
8921062	8922003	And why don't you own a Wii?
8922203	8923383	Because you have a 360 and a PS3.
8923423	8924023	Well, I put off buying...
8949744	8954888	The 360 and the PS3 because I wanted an HDTV because they were made for HDTVs.
8955448	8966636	So now that I have the TV and Wii is now standard def, the video file in me is offended by that and I just don't want one.
8966736	8968417	It's like, I don't know.
8968958	8969938	Nintendo's being ignorant?
8970679	8971519	Yeah.
8971599	8975082	If they put out an HD one or the Wii whatever, Omega...
8975848	8977569	in a year or two, the next gen.
8977649	8983394	I would get that, but I just don't want... I'm sort of over standard definition.
8983894	8987377	Don't care that they're the only system you can do the new Super Mario Bros.
8987557	8988678	or Super Smash Bros.
8988698	8995102	Melee or this Metroid Other M or the fancy Zelda games, but until it's pretty, no thank you.
8997764	8998305	I guess.
8999666	9003148	I mean, it sounds really superficial and I hate the...
9004642	9031918	Fanboys on the forum to just say oh you know the graphics blah blah blah it's all about the graphics but those franchises I've visited those franchises so much and I've played the previous incarnations of Zelda and Metroid that I can just go to a friend's house like it's not that important to me to get a system for those specific franchises which is really all Nintendo is now like you have to be with Nintendo if you want the Zelda whereas all the third party is with
9033191	9052038	Sony and Microsoft so alright well you know that I have a Nintendo system so you know you can come over and play Zelda or what have you if I choose to buy those games for the record you guys are both invited everyone in this room including me because I live here and on the phone with us is invited for PC Engine Night
9052729	9053950	When is PC Engine Night?
9054170	9054791	Sometime.
9055772	9057253	Maybe after Moving Chaos?
9057453	9058033	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
9058053	9061036	We'll get Alan down here one week and we'll have PC Engine Night.
9061076	9061496	It'll be fun.
9061516	9063197	Seriously, we'll get our Dracula X on.
9063778	9068081	Or bring PC Engine over to New Casa de Rob that'll be wired for video and everything.
9068101	9070303	If Dan doesn't crap his pants like he did last time.
9070523	9071384	Just steal it.
9071544	9073025	I did last time.
9073705	9074586	Nice.
9074626	9077288	I should probably let you go.
9077729	9080070	I hate to do that to you, but I'll talk to you later.
9080090	9080431	You know that.
9080951	9081131	Yes.
9081391	9081631	All right.
9081771	9082231	You take care.
9082391	9082771	Good night, guys.
9082791	9084012	Great show.
9084232	9084452	Bye.
9084572	9084892	Thank you.
9084932	9085172	Bye.
9086112	9086392	All right.
9087152	9088733	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9088793	9094114	Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but hey, we need emails, so you should totally write us some emails if you didn't get through tonight.
9094174	9094934	That would be awesome.
9095694	9097354	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9098095	9101195	I'm going to let Loki wrap up with any other last-minute stories, and then we're going to wrap up the show.
9101275	9101535	Loki.
9102756	9108877	The developer behind the Survivor horror game that came out last summer, Cursed Mountain, has gone under.
9108897	9109817	Yeah.
9111305	9114726	Apparently they've run into some financial trouble.
9116367	9117947	Oh well, I got shut down.
9118768	9120888	Too bad.
9123009	9124510	That's all I pretty much had.
9124710	9133393	Oh, Dragon Quest looks like 6 is going to have some new anti-piracy measures put in place on that cart, so it might be a little harder to...
9135646	9156201	DeKrak, and then also there's this one game that I'm playing now that's a homebrew game that's now available on, or I should say that it was a free game that was available now on Wii Homebrew, which is Psyobon, which is Cat Mario, and it's extremely hard and funny because it's extremely hard.
9156221	9158742	Is that what you were giggling at during the Skype calls?
9158823	9160223	It's just really brutal.
9161344	9163626	The second level, you're supposed to go into the warp pipe
9163906	9177679	if you wonder why Loki doesn't talk much during the Skype segment unless you specifically call out his name it's because that's the point of the show where he's catching up on all the funny stuff and you'll randomly just hear him hee hee hee over there in the corner wait it doesn't sound like that but you know what I mean he's laughing at something on the internet
9179719	9179979	All right.
9180159	9180559	Is that it?
9180920	9181900	That's all.
9182400	9184041	We are about out of here.
9184521	9188383	Well, we're going to wrap up the show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
9188403	9195467	But I do want to say before we get to the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio and checking us out and sticking with us through the good times and the bad.
9195867	9201390	I know it sucks that we haven't had any show the past couple weeks, but I'm looking at the live listening numbers and we haven't really tapered off.
9201450	9202651	We're still right back where we were.
9203151	9204512	And so thank you guys for coming out.
9204552	9207013	I know especially the anticipation of us coming back tonight.
9207453	9230678	and I hope the new sound was worth it but at the same time especially for those of you live folks that had to kind of put up with some of the hiccups we've had tonight that will probably continue on into our special live only afterbirth segment after the show thank you guys for sticking by us while we kind of go through all these changes but it's fun it's a new year a new decade of sound and everything
9231258	9259408	so anyhow and of course if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio we are a non-profit show we're not really a business that's out to make money we don't really run ads during the show all we ask if you like the show tell two friends about the show and help us spread the word that's all we ask we're an independent production we don't have a lot of big dollars behind us and we're just here because we want to have fun that being said let's go around and get everybody's final thought DarkSakura I see you picking up the mic so why don't you give us your final thought um yeah
9260749	9261649	Loki, your final thought?
9262570	9266692	Hopefully that new YouTube video will be up this week.
9268112	9272314	My final thought is I totally want a warm chocolate chip cookie right now.
9272774	9273335	Sounds amazing.
9274295	9274535	All right.
9274895	9277276	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show.
9277296	9278237	We really appreciate it.
9278517	9280318	We'll be back here to do it all again next week.
9280718	9284780	Hopefully the computer doesn't blow up or anything until then, but we'll pray that we're back.
9285160	9285520	Bye, guys.
