00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:18,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 3rd, 2010, what could Google be planning for gaming?

2
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:23,139
[SPEAKER_00]: A brand new 8-bit NES game is about to be released, and what in the world is a WiiWa?

3
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:35,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:44,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining you over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And with me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Always ready and alert as always, right?

8
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

9
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

10
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:56,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

11
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,193
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Loki?

12
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:57,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing fine.

13
00:00:57,893 --> 00:00:59,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you YouTubing something over there.

14
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:00,314
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

15
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:06,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just looking at an auction for a bar top cabinet thing because it's hilarious how much they try to charge for these things.

16
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:08,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they want $900 for this.

17
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get two full-size arcade games for that.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,300
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are dumb.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

20
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:38,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, though, they beat me in a three.

21
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,357
[SPEAKER_03]: They only wanted a few hundred dollars for it.

22
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:41,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

23
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:45,679
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a thousand or something, but I was seriously considering it.

24
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,102
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wasn't a stinking adult with stinking adult responsibilities, I would have seriously considered it.

25
00:01:51,162 --> 00:02:00,787
[SPEAKER_03]: But, alas, another piece of my car broke this week, and it made me realize, you know, probably before I indulge in the video game habit, I probably ought to get a car.

26
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably should.

27
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid responsibility.

28
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:04,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

29
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:08,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you are almost 75% to a new present.

30
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, yes, that's right, because you're working on an MP3.

31
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:22,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've just discovered that the real player converter will convert to MP3 from stuff off YouTube.

32
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,201
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of websites that do that, too.

33
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that happen.

34
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,483
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so much easier because it just runs in the background.

35
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:27,804
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

36
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox.

37
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:34,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So enjoy your gift of Angela Aki covers.

38
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:37,238
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

39
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:37,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It's freaking hard.

40
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,329
[SPEAKER_01]: On the iPhone.

41
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:05,231
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a bunch of Ride and Ford going on in the house last night.

42
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:08,511
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were all, no, let's watch Macross.

43
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:09,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were watching Macross.

44
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:10,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Macross Frontier.

45
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually dropped by randomly yesterday.

46
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:14,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

47
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I wanted to show a friend the OLR studio.

48
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had Sonic.

49
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys were watching Macross.

50
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:24,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was kind of like, oh, anime that I'm not familiar with.

51
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't follow anime as closely as I think a lot of our listeners do.

52
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't follow it nearly as much as I used to.

53
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,423
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have plenty of friends that do, and Dan's like, oh, bring it over, let's see what's new.

54
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,925
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Hatalia, which I love.

55
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:40,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one where it's different personifications of countries.

56
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the different countries are characters.

57
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:45,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And America is trying to solve everything through cheeseburgers.

58
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And Japan is very soft-spoken and never gives a clear answer.

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's still playing the hell out of Borderlands, out of curiosity?

60
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty much.

61
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:58,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was really, he's actually played through Ikaruga the other night.

62
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:03,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, when I came over the other night, they were playing some Japanese shooter game on 360.

63
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:07,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure if it was Trigger Hard Excelica or, I only glanced at it for a second.

64
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:08,466
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ikaruga?

65
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:08,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

66
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:14,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they were actually watching playthroughs of other people doing tricks, so they decided they were going to do them themselves.

67
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:19,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And, because they, I think they watched some guy do a perfect playthrough of Ikaruga and decided that they wanted to do it.

68
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

69
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:21,523
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

70
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:23,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how about you?

71
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:23,724
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

72
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:24,105
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do?

73
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:28,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, played Ikaruga on my arcade cabinet because I was working on getting Naomi stuff.

74
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Random.

75
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:29,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

76
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:42,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so I was working on getting my Naomi and Atomic Wave and actually also my Zinc emulation running.

77
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Zinc, though, doesn't seem to run very well.

78
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:51,597
[SPEAKER_04]: The loader that I have for it sucks, so I have to do it by hand.

79
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,921
[SPEAKER_04]: But I tried playing Urgot, and that's pretty fun.

80
00:04:55,021 --> 00:05:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I wish the Japanese ROM would work, because I think the US one doesn't have Cloud in it.

81
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.

82
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:01,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It does?

83
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,312
[SPEAKER_01]: It has Cloud Antifa, because I've played one.

84
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have to unlock it or something?

85
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:17,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not remember, because it's been a long time since I've played it, but I thought it was either that or time released, or that it's some little trick you have to do, but yeah, I've played both of them in the American cabinet.

86
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:26,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then I will have to mess around with that, but in the meantime, I couldn't get any of the controls to work, even though I configured them correctly, it's just being retarded.

87
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:29,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I did play a little bit of Atomic Wave, had...

88
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Dolphin Blue Marvel vs. Capcom 2

89
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:59,792
[SPEAKER_04]: A processor in the arcade cabinet because it's only 2.2 GHz whereas you probably need a little bit more than that.

90
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,356
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually have to overclock it since I can do that.

91
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:09,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that'll fix it because right now the sound's a little laggy and it's kind of annoying.

92
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:15,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, let's see what else did I play other than Ikaruga.

93
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:24,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Guilty Gear Iizuka, which is interesting, because I didn't realize that they had a four-player Guilty Gear game, so that was neat.

94
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:35,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And then other than arcade cabinet stuff, I played through the rest of the LittleBigPlanet Pirates of the Caribbean level pack.

95
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was alright.

96
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:40,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't as cool as the Melgar Solid pack, but it was pretty good.

97
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Still worth the five or six bucks you have to pay for it.

98
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:47,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, how can you top guns?

99
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough, so it's understandable.

100
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:52,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

101
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto, still no Borderlands, thought about it, but been working on the cabinet, so I haven't had a chance to play anything.

102
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:01,544
[SPEAKER_01]: You can borrow Dan's.

103
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Borderlands, I just haven't played it.

104
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:06,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, okay.

105
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:12,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sitting on it for weeks now, months now actually, so I'll eventually get around to it.

106
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to play it too, so if you don't ever crack open that copy, I find it at home.

107
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:20,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's cracked open, it's ready to go, it's just, I just haven't gotten a chance to do it yet.

108
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,836
[SPEAKER_01]: When are you bringing Bayonetta over for me?

109
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,485
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

110
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:53,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're about 8 hours ahead of us.

111
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:06,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get the call in the green!

112
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,269
[SPEAKER_04]: That little wanker!

113
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,253
[SPEAKER_04]: No wanker talk there, but he's like, So, I'm gonna get the green, fella!

114
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:26,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I like getting cussed at in, um, like, other, like, I don't wanna say other languages, but other dialects, I guess you could say, where, you know, other, uh, you know, getting called a poof, and, you know, all those other types of words.

115
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,682
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty brutal, though.

116
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I had 47 kills in 20 minutes with a streak of 14, and, uh...

117
00:08:34,466 --> 00:09:02,462
[SPEAKER_04]: and people were pissed so it was fun in fact actually the second place had less than half as many kills as I did so it was fun so that's what I've been playing all that fun stuff awesome I'm just imagining all the little talk on Grand Theft Auto we don't talk back because it's hard to wear headphones and a headset at the same time so we just listen to it and it's funny

118
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone invented that?

119
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a third party?

120
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,043
[SPEAKER_03]: A headphone slash headset?

121
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:20,487
[SPEAKER_04]: They have my actual 5.1 headset, which by the way, and I don't know why these headsets do this, but one of the channels is already cutting out on it because I guess the cord is so heavy that it's pulling it out a little bit.

122
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm only getting one speaker, which is annoying.

123
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had other headsets do the same thing.

124
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they have like Turtle Beach headsets, but they're like $100.

125
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the cheapest one you can get that has that built in is like

126
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe $60.

127
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:43,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But really what they need to come up with is a clip-on microphone or something like that that you can just wear so you can talk.

128
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:45,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you don't really need the headset to hear people talking.

129
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:50,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Most games have a way you can listen to it through your actual headphones.

130
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:53,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all you really need.

131
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:54,516
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really awkward the way it is.

132
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to the chat room, of course, our always present fourth guest on the show, chat.orangesongeradio.com.

133
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:12,941
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening live on this Sunday night, as we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

134
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be joining us in our chat room, and check that out, chat.orangesongeradio.com.

135
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, I thought Rob's British accent is banned from the show.

136
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember that getting an official banning, but fine, it'll be my Welsh accent there.

137
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

138
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, going into... It's not sing-songy enough.

139
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll work on it.

140
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:38,086
[SPEAKER_03]: If my Japanese pronunciation got better, maybe I should resolve this year to work on my British accent.

141
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:38,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

142
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to Skype some of our British listeners and say, please teach me how to say cute things.

143
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:44,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll teach you...

144
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Teach me how to speak English English.

145
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:51,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please teach me how to speak English.

146
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even do that on the show.

147
00:10:53,567 --> 00:11:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've listened to the past two or three months of show, I don't know if it's because I have to multitask a lot while doing this show or what, but sometimes the things that come out of my mouth, I'm like, what did I say?

148
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:04,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I just totally butchered the English language.

149
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I need English lessons from an English person.

150
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:07,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need.

151
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:08,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

152
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,695
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they do have those.

153
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:13,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that it's...

154
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: British English as a language learning system

155
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:41,851
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

156
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:31,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

158
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,185
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

159
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:30,738
[SPEAKER_03]: and I finally took the opportunity to download Shadow Complex to my 360 and check it out and wow did I miss that like seriously that game was kind of awesome and by kind of I mean really it is like a Super Metroid Castlevania type exploration game but a little more modernized and part I gotta be honest

160
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:32,319
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got over it and downloaded the game and I had an awesome time with it.

162
00:13:55,791 --> 00:14:00,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really wanting to play that game through to completion and I highly recommend it.

163
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:00,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

164
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:12,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I was impressed by how much they crammed into an arcade download because seriously, they could charge $30 for this stuff on Blu-ray or I'm sorry, it's $3.60.

165
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:18,120
[SPEAKER_03]: They could charge this on a DVD and put it in stores and most folks would be none the wiser.

166
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I was very excited to play Shadow Complex.

167
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:34,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll spend a little bit of time with Gyromancer, which I played on the PC a little bit ago, but one of my friends sat me down and kind of explained the game a little better, because I've got to admit, the tutorial, because the game kind of

168
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,116
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

169
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:11,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I feel more accomplished playing Gyromancer I feel like I got nowhere in Puzzle Quest because I didn't spend 100 hours with it

170
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:17,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to spending more time with Gyromancer Did you even bother to look at it on the 360?

171
00:15:17,911 --> 00:15:17,951
[SPEAKER_03]: No

172
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care.

173
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:38,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it on my computer.

174
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta be honest.

175
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:40,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nothing.

176
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:46,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a frivolous, silly thing on the 360 and probably is something most people look at only once.

177
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, I did play with Facebook a little bit too, and I think Facebook looks hideous on the 360.

178
00:15:52,852 --> 00:16:00,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate the way it's laid out because they try to put Facebook in the Xbox crossbar format, which the more and more I use it, the more and more I really don't like the NXE.

179
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all the features, I hate the layout.

180
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:07,459
[SPEAKER_03]: What they had before, I honestly think was better, but whatever.

181
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:17,284
[SPEAKER_03]: The cool thing about Facebook is that you can find friends on Facebook that are on 360, and you can find friends on 360 that are on Facebook.

182
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:25,129
[SPEAKER_03]: The gamer tags and names are linked, so maybe I have people on my Xbox list that I didn't have added on Facebook, or, for example, somehow...

183
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:31,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have Tiara on my Xbox 360 list, but I found, because she's on my Facebook, that she had a gamer tag, so I sent her a friend request.

184
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tiara, if you're listening, accept my friend request.

185
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:35,396
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making me cry.

186
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I had to play a little bit of Last.fm too.

187
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:41,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to catch up on all this crap I missed.

188
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize this is like months old, but it was all new to me.

189
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:53,328
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, the Twitter response I got to my tweet about, hi, for my 360, I have one again, was, oh, well, guess your PlayStation 3 is going to be collecting dust now, huh?

190
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:55,089
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think,

191
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:03,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, this little bit of downtime has really raised my respect for Sony because I know we've given them a lot of crap on the show, and rightfully so.

192
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:04,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

193
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't suddenly said Sony is forgiven for everything they've done wrong.

194
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:13,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they made lots and lots of great improvements in 2009, and there's things I look forward to from them in 2010.

195
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, there's going to be some cases where it's 360 versus PlayStation 3.

196
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:18,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going the route of PlayStation 3.

197
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:20,465
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Final Fantasy XIII.

198
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:21,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan to buy that on PlayStation 3.

199
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:23,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Better controller, better graphics.

200
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:52,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the game was designed for that in the first place that's just where I'm going Microsoft fans, put down the hate mail because there's some things I'm going to opt for on 360 as well for instance a lot of the things that have online play I just know more people on 360 that's probably where I'll go with those games plus I'm still playing a lot of DJ Hero and that's on Playstation 3 for me so I have to throw that out there too I finally got the trophy for playing every song in the game at least once even the songs I didn't want to play I finally played everything at least once so making good progress there

201
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:53,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

202
00:17:54,907 --> 00:18:01,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to our chat room again, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Some people wondering what NXE was, because I just rattled that off.

203
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the new Xbox experience.

204
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,151
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new interface they launched.

205
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:05,911
[SPEAKER_03]: When was that?

206
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that last holiday?

207
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:08,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about September of 08?

208
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:09,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

209
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:13,694
[SPEAKER_03]: When they switched from what was called the Blades to this new system that I can't stand.

210
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:16,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot stand the new 360 layout.

211
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:17,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

212
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:19,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony fans, I'll give you that.

213
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:23,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I think PlayStation 3 makes a hell of a lot more sense than 360 does to navigate around in.

214
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:26,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think it's really simple how they have it set up.

215
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,941
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much useless garbage in there.

216
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:32,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how long it took me to figure out how to change my theme?

217
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that shouldn't be that hard.

218
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:38,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have to go into myself and then it's there.

219
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:39,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not in the guide button.

220
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in these other settings.

221
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:44,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have to do this and this.

222
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that made perfect sense for it to be there.

223
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it's my theme, it would be my preference.

224
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:50,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

225
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:52,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's nowhere on that box to say my preferences.

226
00:18:52,881 --> 00:19:02,566
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, if you hit the guide button and go into preferences, you get a bunch of console preferences that have nothing to do with theme, but like parental guides and user ratings and things I thought I disabled.

227
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:03,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not where I thought to go.

228
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:06,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it better.

229
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:07,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how it's laid out better.

230
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it makes a lot more sense the way it's laid out.

231
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:17,883
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that I don't like is just the ads, I guess, for the stuff that I don't care about.

232
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:21,645
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the stuff that I want to get to quickly, I can get to very quickly.

233
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:23,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, Sony has the ads too.

234
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:26,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm going to hate it on 360, I have to hate it on Sony.

235
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:27,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just... I don't know.

236
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The crossbar just works better for me than NXT's been working.

237
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:31,411
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

238
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:36,890
[SPEAKER_03]: To Microsoft's credit, they tend to upgrade their crap pretty fast.

239
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:43,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe some of these things that I'm QQing about, they will fix on the next update, even though I think they're only doing them yearly now, I'm not sure.

240
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:47,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

241
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:56,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I talked about a lot of games, and really, I didn't even talk about everything I played, because I went on a shopping spree on Steam, because they've been having their massive holiday sale.

242
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you guys alluded to this.

243
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I got Morrowind for five bucks yesterday.

244
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:05,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it was five bucks and I liked Oblivion, yet I'd never played Morrowind.

245
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, yeah, I'm going to drop five bucks on it.

246
00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:11,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got Luminous last week, and I think there was another game I bought too.

247
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:17,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem with this stinking Steam sale is that, yeah, the games are only five bucks, but suddenly I bought four of them.

248
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped 20.

249
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:21,392
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just been friended, Rob.

250
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:22,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

251
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get a message from Tiara?

252
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:24,313
[SPEAKER_01]: She's listening.

253
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:25,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Tiara.

254
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to kick your ass in Puzzle Fighter.

255
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:29,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

256
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll rock band or something.

257
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week.

258
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:35,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go to housekeeping.

259
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:39,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast listeners, I know you thought we've neglected you and I'm sorry.

260
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:40,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my bad.

261
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:42,593
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with Jamie or Matt.

262
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,114
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my responsibility and I've really slacked on it over the holidays.

263
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:46,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But I...

264
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Crack the whip today.

265
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:51,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all four shows from December up, and we are caught up.

266
00:20:51,978 --> 00:21:00,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I don't like to make New Year's resolutions, one of my goals, let's say, for 2010 is to do Monday turnarounds on the shows so that those are up on the feeds on Monday.

267
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:04,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep me on my toes, Twitters and Facebookers.

268
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't have the show up, tell me to quit playing WoW and get the damn show up.

269
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, by the way, it is not as simple as just clicking a button that says upload because we do edit the show.

270
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,635
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say edit, we don't edit content.

271
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:21,220
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really edit anything out unless there's like a huge technical failure that causes the show to go down for 10 minutes or something.

272
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:30,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to clean up the actual MP3s themselves, take out the little, you know, you're listening to all games radio and all that and the little stuff that gets in the master file and all that.

273
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:32,649
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

274
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:49,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

275
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:06,848
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

276
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:52,642
[SPEAKER_03]: and our old pal Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us is going to join us because he always has us on his show but we never seem to get him on ours because we're on after him so there's no real tease at the end of the show because we go off air at that point but we're going to get him on the show tonight to at least say thank you and let him participate in our silly little game but before we get to the games we get to the news Loki yes there's a rumor kind of involving the development of the PlayStation 4 which you know

277
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,192
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it's coming, eventually.

278
00:22:55,652 --> 00:23:02,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously they're probably, you know, they started work on it the day after the PlayStation 3 came out.

279
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:19,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the possible pieces of technology that will be in the PlayStation 4 and possibly considered for additional units afterwards would be this thing called Project Larrabee.

280
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:22,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it is, is it's actually a...

281
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:50,694
[SPEAKER_04]: A piece of hardware developed by Intel And it's kind of an architecture that revolves around a lot of CPUs, that's for sure Because, you know, the kind of diagram that they have They have a bunch of different CPU cores, including this picture I think it's about 16 cores And each with their own, you know, cache And kind of revolving around this thing they call a ring bus Um

282
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,963
[SPEAKER_04]: PC Watch's Hiroshinji Goto

283
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:27,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Naming some unnamed sources familiar with Intel's long-awaited larvae project.

284
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:35,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, apparently, Intel was pursuing relationships with Microsoft and Nintendo as well for their next-gen consoles.

285
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:41,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So, maybe this technology might not be only in the Sony console.

286
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows if it's even going to be in the Sony console.

287
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:46,009
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

288
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:48,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's kind of neat.

289
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:55,555
[SPEAKER_04]: In something like this, you know, they could definitely scale it to however many processors they want in there.

290
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in chat says, Breaking news, PS4 is coming, eventually.

291
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:07,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is what a lot of us that just kind of looked at this story went, yeah, okay, so PS4, they're already planning some of the stuff for it, sure, it's going to happen sometime.

292
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,481
[SPEAKER_03]: What would this really mean for the system?

293
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:12,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is this just a boost in power?

294
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:18,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this, you know, is this vaporware like the emotion engine chip?

295
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:19,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what is this?

296
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:25,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, multi-processors like that, I mean, obviously it's going to be the crunch, everything from graphics to physics,

297
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:28,310
[SPEAKER_04]: GameLogic, whatever.

298
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:44,019
[SPEAKER_04]: With this, obviously, you're going to be able to push better graphics, better physics in the games, more detailed gameplay, better sound, a whole lot more detail in there.

299
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:53,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Problem is, though, when you are able to push that much details, you have to also create that much detail, and then development costs rise, and so on and so forth.

300
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:54,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is kind of a

301
00:25:58,038 --> 00:25:59,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I... Downside to everything.

302
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,081
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how Nintendo's kind of getting around it because their system isn't really pushing that, you know, great graphics.

303
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:11,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there are companies that will try to kind of squeeze every ounce of, you know, power out of the Wii.

304
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:22,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you don't have to because their console doesn't look that... I mean, there's only so much they can do graphic-wise in there, so... Kind of to let the gameplay shine through.

305
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:26,194
[SPEAKER_04]: But with Sony, though, you know, it's really all about...

306
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trying to push better graphics, better specs, better everything.

307
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's really what they've been...

308
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:38,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Do them from the get-go.

309
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:39,223
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they've been really pushing with.

310
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember with the PlayStation 3?

311
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:43,526
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh yeah, all the games are going to come out at 1080p.

312
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's going to run at 120 frames per second.

313
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:47,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be super awesome.

314
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,031
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just going to blow your load when you see anything on the screen.

315
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:50,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That type of stuff.

316
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously that didn't really happen.

317
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of this stuff comes out now at 720p.

318
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:57,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is running at 120 frames per second.

319
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:58,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, TVs...

320
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:04,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Most TVs out there, you wouldn't be able to see that.

321
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:11,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask a weird, maybe tangent kind of question that I don't even know if it has an easy answer, so I'm really posing this to chat as well.

322
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we say this a lot.

323
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:18,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said this as a kid and I've said this growing up and I'm sure a lot of you did this too.

324
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even back in the Nintendo days, 8-bit NES days.

325
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, games look so realistic now.

326
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:27,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how they're going to look any better.

327
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:29,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it looks like a cartoon on my screen.

328
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome, right?

329
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:33,794
[SPEAKER_03]: We always kind of say that and then somehow they get better.

330
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:45,298
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really feel like we're at this point now where like PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, like the stuff that that renders really is close to like DVD, Blu-ray quality.

331
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what is left to improve?

332
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:53,061
[SPEAKER_03]: My eye cannot tell the difference that easily between 720p and 1080p.

333
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,241
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they going to justify an upgrade to PlayStation 4?

334
00:27:55,822 --> 00:28:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing too is, I mean, who knows what the technology is going to be like when the PlayStation 4 comes out.

335
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how long did it take for them to develop, you know...

336
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:07,065
[SPEAKER_04]: High Definition, 720p, 1080p, and so on.

337
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:08,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a few years.

338
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:11,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have no idea what technology is going to be like then.

339
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:21,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, this kind of processor, I wouldn't be surprised if we see this in a future PC processor or anything, this lower B thing where you can add something beyond four cores.

340
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just add as many cores as you want.

341
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, the chip might be bigger or you have multiple processors in there and stuff, but I don't know.

342
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:32,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

343
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:35,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I have to admit, you have a pretty good argument there.

344
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:40,071
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that it will do we haven't thought of yet, or it would already be in the system.

345
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they're just making it to do things that we haven't thought of yet.

346
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:55,031
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, and this might be crazy talk, but especially with, you know, Avatar, the movie having done so well at the box office and being so well received, especially as the visuals.

347
00:28:55,091 --> 00:29:02,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't seen it yet myself, and I know I ragged on it, but clearly I must have been wrong because everybody I know has been raving about the movie.

348
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:09,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they don't like the story, everybody's pretty consistent with, but the visuals, wow, wow, wowie, wow.

349
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is this whole 3D...

350
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:13,025
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 1⁄2 hours.

351
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:13,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

352
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:42,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.

353
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:57,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hilarious.

354
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:03,867
[SPEAKER_03]: AmazeSatsuma in chat says, the PlayStation 4 will give you new eyes to see its new, better, older graphics.

355
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:08,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you might be joking, but if we're talking 3D, you gotta have those glasses, right?

356
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,313
[SPEAKER_03]: That's new eyes of a sort.

357
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:10,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

358
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, you do need the glasses.

359
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:17,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, I could see something, you know, for, like, realty, where it's just polarized glasses.

360
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are cheap.

361
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'd rather have that than $200 shutter glasses, so...

362
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:52,877
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess the old rule of thumb is gaming has to get closer and closer to the holodeck from Star Trek is that every system brings us one step closer to the holodeck and 3D glasses will be a pretty big step in that direction until eventually I do my PlayStation 6 is just a room in my house that I walk into and you know computer activate Final Fantasy program and I am in the holodeck basically that's where gaming is headed right?

363
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,274
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember we did have the U-Force?

364
00:31:00,637 --> 00:31:01,277
[SPEAKER_03]: The U-Suck?

365
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:04,520
[SPEAKER_03]: The U-Force.

366
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,484
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend had one of those and it did not work like you would think in the advertisements, that's for dang sure.

367
00:31:10,524 --> 00:31:18,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one of the ones that came with, oh shoot, what was that game that was on Genesis and then on Sega CD?

368
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,391
[SPEAKER_01]: The Activator.

369
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:22,924
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I can't remember the game and it was a really cool game.

370
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:27,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never forget when Loki took the activator and made it a Para Para Paradise controller.

371
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,447
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I thought about it.

372
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:30,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I just took it apart.

373
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:31,749
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, I didn't even take it apart.

374
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I just threw it away.

375
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I don't know what I did with that.

376
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:37,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to, though.

377
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,497
[SPEAKER_03]: How long until someone puts their dick in it?

378
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:05,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's... Not necessarily how long.

379
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:09,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically, as I've seen before, it's TTP.

380
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to penis.

381
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether it be like... Is there a website dedicated to this?

382
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,022
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there isn't.

383
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:21,564
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically, you know, in how long will someone create a penis with it or put their penis in it?

384
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:23,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Or use it... And install Linux on it.

385
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:24,606
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the other question.

386
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Or use it in conjunction with their penis.

387
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically... You know, like for example...

388
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:34,050
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii Vitality Sensor.

389
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:40,774
[SPEAKER_04]: How long until someone puts a penis into that?

390
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:42,154
[SPEAKER_04]: LittleBigPlanet.

391
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:44,356
[SPEAKER_04]: How long until someone creates a penis in that?

392
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:48,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like milliseconds.

393
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:52,420
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole bunch of stuff like that.

394
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,200
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good point.

395
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:57,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get to the holodeck, there's going to be guys that never leave the house.

396
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:57,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

397
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:02,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the holodeck has a holobathroom because people will live there.

398
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,870
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be strange.

399
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

400
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:09,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, hey, changing tones completely.

401
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:18,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else that game devices do these days is play movies and obviously digital distribution is getting big but some studios might have some second thoughts after what happened this week.

402
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:23,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony apparently put the movie Armored, which is a new release that's playing in theaters right now.

403
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not heard of this movie but it looks like the

404
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:30,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Bow, Pow action type of flick that I would not usually see.

405
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:38,216
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Armored is the movie and it's Matt Dillon and Lawrence Fishburne and Jean Reno and all these people.

406
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Peter Petrelli's in it though.

407
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I see him in the poster.

408
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,024
[SPEAKER_03]: All these people are in this movie, Armored.

409
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:49,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, the movie... I don't know how it's doing at the box office.

410
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:50,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's in the top ten.

411
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, what?

412
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:57,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got Avatar and the Sherlock Holmes and the Alvin and the freaking Chipmunks.

413
00:33:58,197 --> 00:33:59,137
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that happen?

414
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:00,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And all this.

415
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Armored, despite the fact that it's not doing well in theaters, maybe this is not helping the case.

416
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:08,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It was available for download on the PlayStation Store this week.

417
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,762
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you could actually download a movie already in theaters on the PlayStation Store.

418
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just that, it was up for free.

419
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:18,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I call that the internet.

420
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but usually this type of thing is not, like, officially done by Sony.

421
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And, to be honest, this really wasn't either.

422
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:36,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, of course, lol whoopsie, you know, somebody accidentally put that thing up long before it should have gone up and put it up for the price of free.

423
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:43,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I think is interesting about this, I mean, yeah, haha, point and laugh, do your Nelson, aha, you know, at Sony for whatever happened over this.

424
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But I find it interesting that...

425
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,631
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

426
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:12,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's waiting to deliver the movie to the service.

427
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:15,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize, I think this is one of Sony's studios that put the movie out.

428
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that's part of the reason.

429
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:23,929
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, isn't that kind of weird that it was sitting there on the store waiting to go?

430
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably all these movies are already sitting on the store if people knew how to hack in there.

431
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:37,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that, and this even goes back to the VHS days, is that there were often screener copies available for awards ceremonies and whatnot.

432
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:42,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a copy of American Pie, not American Pie, American Beauty.

433
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,959
[SPEAKER_01]: When, no, I take that back, I take that back.

434
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,339
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Titanic is what I had.

435
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a screening version of Titanic when it had just gotten out of the theater.

436
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:56,603
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way I was going to see it was for free.

437
00:35:56,923 --> 00:36:01,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a really, really good friend of mine who may or may not be sitting in this room used to get those screener copies all the time.

438
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,166
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not those kind of screener copies.

439
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the review screeners.

440
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:11,110
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual... For your consideration, Oscar screeners.

441
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

442
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,552
[SPEAKER_04]: They have screen copies of movies literally right... Sometimes even before they come out.

443
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:22,255
[SPEAKER_04]: We watched Snakes on a Plane at my work right before we went to theaters and...

444
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:24,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

445
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it... I saw that at Disneyland.

446
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.

447
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,008
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it can be done.

448
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:33,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... Yeah, but I don't think PlayStation 3 is being used as a screening service.

449
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, kind of interesting if it could be.

450
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:41,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised that they don't have... You know, because with piracy and everything going on, I'm kind of surprised they don't have a device.

451
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:48,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be funny, though, if that copy gets ripped and just, you know, dumped and then that is... I'm sure it already happened.

452
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:51,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened long before you thought of it.

453
00:36:53,497 --> 00:36:54,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though.

454
00:36:54,497 --> 00:36:56,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about that movie at all.

455
00:36:57,459 --> 00:37:00,820
[SPEAKER_04]: If I saw it for free, I'd be like, nope, still don't want to watch it.

456
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

457
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I have better things to do for an hour and a half.

458
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:13,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but still, I'm going to say call weird on the whole it was up on the marketplace long before it should have been, right?

459
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:14,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

460
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That does kind of go without saying.

461
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:20,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure somebody's going to get a write-up over that one.

462
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:21,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens now.

463
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:24,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's probably pissing their pants.

464
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably already fired.

465
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how about...

466
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:41,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't really think this is strange news at all, but Final Fantasy XIII sales have actually decreased from how they were during the release.

467
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:53,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why that's a really big thing, because just about when anything comes out, especially something big like that, everyone's going to be picking up their copy during the first week.

468
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a million plus sales.

469
00:37:54,944 --> 00:38:06,112
[SPEAKER_01]: release day, broke records for the first week, and then it basically dropped about a million units into the second week.

470
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:10,034
[SPEAKER_01]: It did take a dip because everyone's already bought it.

471
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:19,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Squeenix is pretty much like, well, when it gets the worldwide release, we're going to hit our numbers, so they're not too worried about it.

472
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:47,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I think another thing, especially with Final Fantasy XIII is that they, dude, they released it the week before Christmas, so of course the second week is gonna, I mean, I don't know how big of a holiday Christmas is in Japan compared to here, I'm imagining it's not quite the same big deal and same shopping patterns that we have here but, you know, still, that's gotta have some impact is that you don't really have the amount of holiday purchasing going on in the second week when you release your game the week before a big holiday, right?

473
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:49,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's a part of it too.

474
00:38:49,298 --> 00:38:49,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

475
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,139
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

476
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,372
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

477
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:42,167
[SPEAKER_03]: and in Europe.

478
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge first week sales.

479
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:45,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge drop-off second week.

480
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,311
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% drop-off second week.

481
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:53,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, they're just not releasing at a time like Christmas where it's going to sell consistently.

482
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:54,557
[SPEAKER_03]: March is kind of a weird month.

483
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:55,878
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have already had it ready.

484
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:58,020
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

485
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:08,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so other things might cause the drop-off of Final Fantasy XIII would be WeWa.

486
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:24,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well maybe not, but WiiWa is this thing, I think I talked about it on the show before, because this is where I got my Cage Match song, D-A-N-C-E, from, at least the idea for it.

487
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, WiiWa is a brand new game that's coming out, and it's using a unique...

488
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:33,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um...

489
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,450
[SPEAKER_04]: it looks neat, I guess I don't know

490
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,418
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of game is it?

491
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:08,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a pet sim game?

492
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like an action game?

493
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:10,339
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like an action game.

494
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:13,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like something you'd see from Rare or something even.

495
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of a little platformer game where you walk around and you sneak up on enemies and stuff like that.

496
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:30,865
[SPEAKER_04]: They have little mini games in there including one that I guess the WiiWare has these bungee cord things on it where you can fling it into the air and you kind of do that almost like a spring.

497
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:35,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pulling up a little video here in studio courtesy of our chat room.

498
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:55,978
[SPEAKER_03]: These little, looks like a, kind of a Crash the Bandicoot Oh, you put the Wiimote in its mouth, so you force feed it Okay Oh, so you have to like, shake the thing around, that's kind of cute Back and forth and stuff

499
00:41:57,492 --> 00:41:58,233
[SPEAKER_01]: That's adorable.

500
00:41:58,493 --> 00:41:59,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of cute.

501
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:04,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I noticed that, you know, it's not aimed at adults.

502
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:09,225
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a little, like, six-year-old kid in the video doing this.

503
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:12,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

504
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I would totally play this.

505
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:15,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

506
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:21,928
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

507
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:50,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I will point out, that little stuffed animal has a hole in its mouth.

508
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:52,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to penis?

509
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,117
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 seconds.

510
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

511
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:58,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new peripheral.

512
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be measured.

513
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: No pun intended.

514
00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:01,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

515
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:10,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of adorable and cute games, although this one I don't think Jamie plays quite as much.

516
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:11,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she should, though.

517
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:20,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And if she wants to know where to begin, LittleBigPlanet has done the first annual Saki Awards, or that they're calling them the Sakademy Awards.

518
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:21,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really cute little pun there.

519
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,491
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sakademy Awards.

520
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:26,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Media Molecule has been giving out all these types of awards.

521
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:30,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know there's 1.5 million LittleBigPlanet levels right now?

522
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:31,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.

523
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:32,977
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.

524
00:43:33,498 --> 00:43:36,300
[SPEAKER_03]: How many stupid levels make up?

525
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably 1.49 million really bad levels.

526
00:43:39,562 --> 00:43:41,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still a lot, though, if you have 100,000 good levels.

527
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:42,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, that's true.

528
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:52,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the awards that they gave out, Best Mashima Video, Best Visuals and Use of Special Effects, Best Use of Story in a Level, and all more.

529
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:54,612
[SPEAKER_04]: The Best Visuals one was pretty awesome.

530
00:43:54,732 --> 00:44:00,336
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a post-apocalyptic, I think was the name of it, and it actually had...

531
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:02,157
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

532
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:21,491
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

533
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:45,920
[SPEAKER_03]: and put them on a separate planet or something or put them in a separate menu.

534
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Something where I can go straight to the best.

535
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:54,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I can weed through all the crap that's out there and just go straight to these levels I have to see.

536
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:58,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they had a category for best trophy whoring level.

537
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:04,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember when the game first came out, all the high-rated levels were like, earn seven trophies in 30 seconds!

538
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:12,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at some of the other ones on there, because of course the Contra one won for best collaboration, which is awesome.

539
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: All the Contra levels, as it should have.

540
00:45:17,943 --> 00:45:19,504
[SPEAKER_04]: There was best...

541
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:23,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Logic Device or something like that.

542
00:45:23,983 --> 00:45:24,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Computer.

543
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:29,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the LittleBigPlanet Calculator because that was really, really involved.

544
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,210
[SPEAKER_04]: There was... I'm trying to think what some of the other ones were.

545
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,092
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like a Best Community Project.

546
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand what that was.

547
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was just like tools.

548
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:44,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they had logic tools that you could use for your machines and stuff.

549
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:48,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, definitely check out the post-apocalyptic level because that looked pretty...

550
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:49,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

551
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, when I have been playing LittleBigPlanet recently, I've been checking out those new Pirates of the Caribbean levels, so I haven't had time to check out the Academy winners.

552
00:46:12,326 --> 00:46:12,946
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you like those?

553
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:14,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cute.

554
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:21,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play a whole lot, so I can't really give you a full review yet, but I was kind of surprised that you can't stay underwater very long.

555
00:46:21,388 --> 00:46:25,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there items later that increase your breathing time and things I haven't gotten to yet?

556
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:32,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get scuba gear that allows you to breathe underwater forever, so you can get that.

557
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:34,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured that was there, yeah.

558
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:38,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I did like how the water can raise and lower.

559
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:45,176
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one part of the very first level where you can flood the town and then you bring the flood down.

560
00:46:45,196 --> 00:46:48,037
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of neat.

561
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:56,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love the fact that LittleBigPlanet is still being supported and that they haven't taken that route that I think some developers would have and put all this in LittleBigPlanet 2.

562
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: They've really been supporting this one game.

563
00:46:59,822 --> 00:47:00,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

564
00:47:02,023 --> 00:47:04,084
[SPEAKER_03]: A really good PlayStation 3 value, I gotta say.

565
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:06,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Color me impressed.

566
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:09,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I named it my game of the year last year, and I still stand by it.

567
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:13,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of the greatest games they've released in quite some time.

568
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:17,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just biased, I don't know.

569
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, moving on with more news, and we'll get to release dates.

570
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:21,532
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

571
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:26,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some news about Sonic Racing for 360.

572
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:29,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Sonic R, just to clarify.

573
00:47:30,968 --> 00:47:34,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's actually going to be characters that you can use for Sonic Racing.

574
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:38,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Namely, your avatars will be playable and Banjo-Kazooie.

575
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really don't give a crap about Banjo.

576
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think it would be pretty cool to go ahead and use my avatar.

577
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:55,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other characters in the game, too, are, of course, Sonic, Tails, Shadow, I from Super Monkey Ball, Samba.

578
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:57,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in the Samba de Amigo Monkey.

579
00:47:57,302 --> 00:47:57,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cute.

580
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:03,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Beat from Jet Set Radio, Alex Kidd, Billy Hatcher, and... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

581
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:05,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega is acknowledging Jet Set Radio?

582
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:06,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

583
00:48:07,006 --> 00:48:08,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good, right?

584
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:10,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex Kidd.

585
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:12,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

586
00:48:12,396 --> 00:48:14,140
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time we had an Alex Kidd game?

587
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:18,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy Hatcher and Ryo Hazuki, the guy from Shenmue.

588
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:24,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's like Sega's throwing bones at all these fans.

589
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:28,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, damn it, we need a new Jet Set future, Jet Set Radio.

590
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:29,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it, we need a new Shenmue.

591
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:32,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're teasing us with this silly little racing game.

592
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:40,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you remember when they teased us with having knights in that stupid eye toy game back when?

593
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:40,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

594
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:41,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Knights in the game?

595
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:41,813
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

596
00:48:42,913 --> 00:48:52,338
[SPEAKER_01]: But they said that there's rumors, though, that other possibilities is Ulala and Akira from Virtua Fighter and Vice from Skies of Arcadia.

597
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:53,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're just being mean.

598
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:57,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we all know there's not going to be another Space Channel 5 game.

599
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,841
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be.

600
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:00,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Channel 5.

601
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:05,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wish there would be, but they're just being mean by putting Ulala in the game.

602
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:06,825
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just rude.

603
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:10,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Michaels in the game.

604
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:12,951
[SPEAKER_03]: If they put Pudding Dye in there, I'm going to scream.

605
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:14,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she was my favorite.

606
00:49:14,673 --> 00:49:15,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Pudding.

607
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:16,916
[SPEAKER_03]: She was my favorite.

608
00:49:17,717 --> 00:49:19,098
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, sorry, it was Jaguar.

609
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: With his little group.

610
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:23,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought steampunk stuff.

611
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:53,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

612
00:50:13,248 --> 00:50:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl would have it in her band.

613
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:16,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like the Taylor Swift microphone or something.

614
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought that for my, you know, because I liked karaoke and all that stuff.

615
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:25,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny and it made me laugh when my avatar was like dancing with it.

616
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:30,755
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I was thinking like, okay, if I'm playing this racing game or whatever, you're not going to see that microphone shoved in the back of the car.

617
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:33,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be funny though.

618
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, I completely forgot about that.

619
00:50:36,184 --> 00:50:42,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that racing game that they had out that was free to download and then they have all those expansions you have to buy and stuff to it?

620
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:43,170
[SPEAKER_03]: On 360?

621
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:43,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

622
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, keep in mind I've been asleep for like the past five months on 360.

623
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:48,014
[SPEAKER_04]: That came out like in July.

624
00:50:48,174 --> 00:50:48,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did it?

625
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:50,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

626
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:51,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

627
00:50:52,078 --> 00:50:53,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember if it came out.

628
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:53,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So many games, so little time.

629
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:54,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

630
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:58,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, because... No, I don't know if it came out because I would have downloaded it because it would have been free.

631
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:00,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

632
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,771
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

633
00:51:25,464 --> 00:51:26,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So many games, so little time.

634
00:51:26,926 --> 00:51:29,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, we all have day jobs.

635
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:34,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Your game sites, you like to go surf and all that, they get paid to play games eight hours a day and all that.

636
00:51:35,356 --> 00:51:35,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do that.

637
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:39,221
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to work in our free time, so sometimes we can't play everything.

638
00:51:39,782 --> 00:51:42,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, chat, there's a lot of folks in chat saying...

639
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Misty says, Barbie crap?

640
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a cell phone and I got the free Chocobo.

641
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:49,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I waste enough money on Rock Band download content.

642
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:52,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft said I would have expected Disney stuff, but Barbie, come on Rob.

643
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:54,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't being literal.

644
00:51:54,134 --> 00:51:59,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't literally Barbie, but I call it that because, I mean, it's basically the same thing.

645
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a Dresher Barbie doll, and there's no...

646
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:04,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I did pay for Avatar content, did I tell you?

647
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you buy?

648
00:52:04,982 --> 00:52:06,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one of the steampunk outfits.

649
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:07,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have leftover points.

650
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have one of those ginormous helmets or something?

651
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:14,646
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got like the duster jacket with the kind of gypsy top.

652
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm actually planning on getting the rest of the steampunk set.

653
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Because actually, I don't really buy much with my points.

654
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan usually puts all the points on his account and buys the stuff for us.

655
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to go ahead and get the rest of the steampunk outfit.

656
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:30,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think the stuff's cute.

657
00:52:31,412 --> 00:52:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

658
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:33,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Sims stuff, what's the difference?

659
00:52:34,616 --> 00:53:01,318
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the games I didn't mention during my gaming week but I did play for a little while was 1 vs 100 and I was actually cracking up because sometimes it'll show these random people in the mob who get questions right or wrong and it cracks my shit up when I see this person wearing just like a t-shirt and jeans but they have one of those uber robot helmets on their avatar and it's like that looks hideous and 45,000 people just saw how stupid your avatar looks like

660
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:06,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And they couldn't be happier Then again, I have a princess microphone, so who am I to judge?

661
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:08,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Who am I to judge?

662
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:17,488
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you didn't buy a fake cat I didn't buy a fake cat Alright, let's travel the world and look at some release dates If there are any

663
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,548
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

664
00:53:36,315 --> 00:54:03,204
[SPEAKER_04]: newer games though Bayonetta finally making its way out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week so definitely worth picking that one up Fast Food Panic on the Nintendo DS making its way out and not really gaming related but the Guinness Book of World Records Gamers Edition is making its way out to bookstands as well and you should at least thumb through it but I don't know if you should pay them for it you know

665
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

666
00:54:24,022 --> 00:54:25,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than the Guinness Book of Records

667
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:48,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you know you're supposed to say twat?

668
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:16,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for releases, unfortunately.

669
00:55:16,586 --> 00:55:19,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You only have those magazines for the articles, of course, right?

670
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:22,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the articles are really boring.

671
00:55:24,058 --> 00:55:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the forums are funny, but the articles suck.

672
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:31,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, let's look at Japanese release dates.

673
00:55:31,446 --> 00:55:34,307
[SPEAKER_03]: How we go from that to Japanese release dates, I have no idea, but we do.

674
00:55:34,987 --> 00:55:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, James Cameron's Avatar the game gets its Japanese localization from Ubisoft this week on the 7th of January.

675
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,251
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when the games are coming out.

676
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:47,952
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also making its way to the PlayStation 3, just so you know.

677
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:53,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to point out, speaking of Batman Arkham Asylum, that is finally making its way to Japan next week.

678
00:55:54,414 --> 00:55:56,016
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Do you want...

679
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:14,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the trailer for that?

680
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:16,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen little bits and pieces.

681
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:20,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, look, if you go to the website for it, the trailer is freaking amazing.

682
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put it on the console.

683
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this is my biggest bitch about these portable games.

684
00:56:26,622 --> 00:56:34,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually want it for PSP so that I can... Did you hear this week, well, actually, yeah, earlier this week on the DSi, Oregon Trail came out.

685
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:38,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Like old school Apple IIe or this new shit?

686
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:38,870
[SPEAKER_03]: This new shit.

687
00:56:38,931 --> 00:56:39,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass.

688
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:40,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass.

689
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:50,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you don't have direction keys on the DS in order to shoot.

690
00:56:50,405 --> 00:56:56,367
[SPEAKER_03]: In these new games, do you shoot five buffalo and then like, congratulations, you shot 3,400 pounds of food.

691
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:58,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you can only carry 100 back to the wagon.

692
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:00,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow doubt it.

693
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:02,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

694
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:04,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

695
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:11,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, there's actually another Oregon Trail game that I linked in our show role.

696
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:12,053
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to see.

697
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:13,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Oregon Trail of Physics.

698
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:15,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

699
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:16,796
[SPEAKER_03]: The Oregon Trail of Physics?

700
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:18,398
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Oregon Trail with Physics.

701
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:19,298
[SPEAKER_03]: With Physics?

702
00:57:19,698 --> 00:57:20,299
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

703
00:57:20,419 --> 00:57:21,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it not make the show role tonight?

704
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Then tell us about it.

705
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:24,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this game.

706
00:57:24,362 --> 00:57:28,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even really called the Oregon Trail, but it is exactly the Oregon Trail.

707
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:32,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the Oregon Trail.

708
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:37,896
[SPEAKER_04]: You stuff your cart full of crap and whatever you're carrying with you.

709
00:57:38,396 --> 00:57:42,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like combining the Oregon Trail with that sledding game.

710
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it was.

711
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,044
[SPEAKER_04]: You jump hills and stuff.

712
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:59,573
[SPEAKER_03]: so your ox just start running down the hill and then you go off of it and fly and stuff and if you land upside down like people get injured stuff like that I've seen a flash game like that yeah I know what you're talking about so somebody skinned that with the Oregon Trail basically

713
00:57:59,898 --> 00:58:03,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's... Oh, what was it called here?

714
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It is... Let's Go Find Eldorado.

715
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:09,042
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you die of dysentery in the game?

716
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that possible?

717
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:10,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It is possible.

718
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:14,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen... There's a video of it, and I will link it.

719
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:14,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a Flash game?

720
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a Flash game.

721
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:19,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

722
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to look into this while DarkSakura covers the UK releases.

723
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:23,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks hilarious.

724
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:28,555
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny, you were just saying, what was it called, The Road to El Dorado?

725
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:33,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just watching The Mysterious Cities of Gold last night, so I thought that was funny.

726
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:34,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Random!

727
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:35,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Random!

728
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:38,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you remember, it's on Hulu now, Rob.

729
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:40,445
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mysterious Cities of Gold.

730
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:43,547
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all this crazy stuff on Hulu.

731
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Loki's showing me a picture of...

732
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:49,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Bayonetta Bayonetta

733
00:59:14,778 --> 00:59:19,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't believe they didn't try to crank that out in time for Christmas, especially because it did get its release over there in Japan.

734
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're just hoping for big sales off of gift cards.

735
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:22,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

736
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:25,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

737
00:59:25,543 --> 00:59:25,823
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

738
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm very excited about this game.

739
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:30,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here's a little YouTube.

740
00:59:30,745 --> 00:59:34,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if this... I don't know if this has sound effects or anything, but this is the Oregon Trail.

741
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:42,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a little frog croaking or something.

742
00:59:42,406 --> 00:59:43,247
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is that?

743
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:43,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's upside down.

744
00:59:44,868 --> 00:59:45,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it just fart?

745
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,511
[SPEAKER_04]: People do get dysentery in that.

746
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:48,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they?

747
00:59:48,311 --> 00:59:50,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, yeah, John Boy has a broken arm.

748
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,555
[SPEAKER_03]: This game looks amazing.

749
00:59:52,635 --> 00:59:57,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's more like Excite Bike with the Oregon Trail.

750
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody has typhoid right now.

751
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:01,944
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like extra physics physics.

752
01:00:03,085 --> 01:00:04,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is this game available at?

753
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:05,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

754
01:00:05,552 --> 01:00:06,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I won it totally.

755
01:00:06,613 --> 01:00:07,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Ludumdare.com.

756
01:00:07,973 --> 01:00:10,195
[SPEAKER_03]: L-U-D-U-M-D-A-R-E.com.

757
01:00:10,335 --> 01:00:11,335
[SPEAKER_01]: You should post that in chat, Rob.

758
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do that right now.

759
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:14,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Good!

760
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:17,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited that you're doing that, Rob.

761
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:19,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do more news while I'm posting that in chat?

762
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Loki.

763
01:00:23,262 --> 01:00:23,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

764
01:00:25,044 --> 01:00:27,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see, I got so distracted by...

765
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:30,496
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

766
01:00:49,972 --> 01:00:59,059
[SPEAKER_04]: They were saying that there's already some kind of interactive games on YouTube, kind of done with videos, sort of like your choose-your-own-adventure type stuff.

767
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:15,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were saying that the patent-tiled web-based system for generation of interactive games based on digital videos was filed earlier this year, or I guess last year, and it was...

768
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:28,742
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really say what exactly it's going to be, but it sounds like something that links videos together, creating different narratives and alternatives and different scenarios for the users.

769
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:30,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marky Mark, create your own video?

770
01:01:30,523 --> 01:01:31,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome!

771
01:01:32,324 --> 01:01:35,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably something so that you can create your own, kind of choose your own adventure stuff.

772
01:01:36,246 --> 01:01:42,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I wouldn't be surprised if they did add casual games to YouTube or something like that, or you could just play little Flash games.

773
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would fit right in, I would think.

774
01:01:46,845 --> 01:01:47,206
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube the Game

775
01:02:15,718 --> 01:02:16,059
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

776
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:35,734
[SPEAKER_03]: What's not as weird, because there's a lot of folks that are really into classic games and respecting the classics and so forth.

777
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a project going on at the Atari Museum where they're actually reconstructing a lot of the old proprietary chips.

778
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:50,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Things from the 2600 and the VCS, also known as the Atari 5200 and Atari's old 8-bit computers.

779
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:56,745
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually using data that was recovered from old tapes used in the original manufacturing.

780
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:04,770
[SPEAKER_03]: The Atari Museum's Kurt Vendel has noted that the project has a practical application besides just, you know, it being history.

781
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the potential of this?

782
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:16,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, doing the chips in smaller SMT packaging and potentially bringing back to life some of the later CMOS designs of combo chips, which could lead to a SOC or system on a chip.

783
01:03:17,597 --> 01:03:18,959
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

784
01:03:33,203 --> 01:03:36,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it's basically like those flashback consoles.

785
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:40,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, you'll see a lot of Nintendos on a chip.

786
01:03:40,926 --> 01:03:45,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's probably not one chip, but it's a few chips, but really shrunken down.

787
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:51,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those little knockoff Nintendo systems and stuff that they sell at the mall that Nintendo gets pissed at.

788
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:55,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the flea market.

789
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:56,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons and tons of those things.

790
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:57,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

791
01:03:57,491 --> 01:04:02,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are great for turning them into little, like, portable or arcade systems and stuff.

792
01:04:02,553 --> 01:04:02,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

793
01:04:04,588 --> 01:04:06,049
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

794
01:04:30,275 --> 01:04:36,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's worse for others than it was for me, but boy, going to one of those made me feel very old.

795
01:04:37,203 --> 01:04:43,050
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm glad that that stuff will be preserved and hopefully made more portable to future generations.

796
01:04:44,306 --> 01:04:48,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of classics, we always like to take a moment to pay some tribute to classic games.

797
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:54,572
[SPEAKER_03]: When DarkSakura takes a trip into the vault every week and pulls out a game that she says, you know what, folks?

798
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:57,714
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be playing this game, or you should check out this game.

799
01:04:57,754 --> 01:05:03,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you didn't know about it before, but it's our classic video game of the week, and it's preserved in our Orange Lounge Radio Museum.

800
01:05:03,978 --> 01:05:04,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever!

801
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:05,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever and ever.

802
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Which we call the wiki.

803
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:11,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, what game are you lavishing praise upon this week?

804
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:14,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first of all, the wrong link.

805
01:05:15,784 --> 01:05:17,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me actually find the right link again.

806
01:05:17,485 --> 01:05:17,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

807
01:05:18,186 --> 01:05:20,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because this isn't the link that I posted in the thing.

808
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:25,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, might have just broke on its way or something, so don't know what to tell you there.

809
01:05:29,095 --> 01:05:30,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there we go.

810
01:05:30,736 --> 01:05:39,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the game is, um, Choji Kyu Yo Sai Makros Oboete Imasuka, which is, Makros, do you remember love?

811
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,041
[SPEAKER_01]: which of course we know there was a

812
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,078
[SPEAKER_01]: An anime movie.

813
01:05:45,238 --> 01:05:46,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, listen to the music for a second.

814
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hear the music?

815
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:57,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the scramble music from the actual Macross movies.

816
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:58,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Explosions!

817
01:05:58,864 --> 01:05:59,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, speaker.

818
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:05,547
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shooter based off of the Macross anime.

819
01:06:06,048 --> 01:06:10,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one actually has to do with sort of a... According to...

820
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:30,076
[SPEAKER_01]: The creator Kawamori Shouji, that this is not an exact final word on what happened with the crew of the SDF-2 Mega Road 1, which was the ship that was taking everybody else to discover what was at the center of the galaxy.

821
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:36,479
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just sort of like a dramatization about what might have happened.

822
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:44,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But you basically, it shows you leaving Earth and fighting a bunch of Zentradi everywhere.

823
01:06:44,483 --> 01:06:49,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually a pretty cool game.

824
01:06:49,526 --> 01:06:50,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorites.

825
01:06:51,994 --> 01:07:00,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually had new dialogue recorded for the game when it came out by Mari Iijima, who was Minmei's voice actor.

826
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Minmei is still annoying, but she's Minmei.

827
01:07:05,804 --> 01:07:07,665
[SPEAKER_01]: But lots of shooting.

828
01:07:07,705 --> 01:07:12,828
[SPEAKER_01]: You could lock on different enemies in foreground and everything.

829
01:07:12,868 --> 01:07:13,429
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.

830
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:18,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out on Saturn and it also came out on PlayStation and I actually have both copies.

831
01:07:20,113 --> 01:07:20,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ask.

832
01:07:20,713 --> 01:07:23,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I came into them somehow or another for cheap.

833
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:30,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is, you know, I'd say for any Macross fan, it is the game you should have.

834
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:33,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got actually a ton of Macross games.

835
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:33,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got...

836
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:38,342
[SPEAKER_01]: The Macross Plus game.

837
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:40,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Macross M3 for Dreamcast.

838
01:07:41,463 --> 01:07:44,224
[SPEAKER_01]: But of all of them, I think that this one is probably my favorite.

839
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:45,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I take that back.

840
01:07:45,464 --> 01:07:50,466
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one on PC Engine that I really like, but this one is the more easily accessible one that I like.

841
01:07:52,326 --> 01:07:56,367
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely one that any Macross and shooter fan should have.

842
01:07:56,808 --> 01:07:57,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that not just epic?

843
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:03,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not as familiar with the anime series, but it certainly looks like a heck of a shooter.

844
01:08:03,272 --> 01:08:04,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We got it as Robotech, Rob.

845
01:08:04,712 --> 01:08:06,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plane is huge.

846
01:08:06,492 --> 01:08:08,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes up a pretty big chunk of the screen.

847
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:09,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised there.

848
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:11,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it also transforms between different modes.

849
01:08:12,194 --> 01:08:16,214
[SPEAKER_01]: As you see, it's in the full-on robot mode.

850
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:18,635
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Gerwalk mode, which is like a halfway in between.

851
01:08:21,355 --> 01:08:23,896
[SPEAKER_01]: But this did come out over here as Robotech.

852
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:26,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

853
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:27,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty epic.

854
01:08:28,477 --> 01:08:29,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool game.

855
01:08:30,097 --> 01:08:30,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

856
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:34,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there it is, folks, your classic game of the week.

857
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:38,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Macross, do you remember love on the Saturday?

858
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:39,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

859
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know DarkSakura loves her Saturn games.

860
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting off 2010 no differently.

861
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back, we'll have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

862
01:08:50,596 --> 01:08:57,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some quick news for you this week, including what's latest and greatest on the Virtual Console and iPhone games and Rock Band.

863
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have some other news we're going to get into, including 8-bit NES developments.

864
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:03,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, believe it or not.

865
01:09:03,624 --> 01:09:07,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And video games meet obscure Winter Olympic sports.

866
01:09:07,307 --> 01:09:07,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I kid you not.

867
01:09:08,388 --> 01:09:10,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, listless...

868
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:17,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's topic for listless, and if you've never done listless before, please, please join us in chat because the chat room plays a big, big role in this.

869
01:09:17,494 --> 01:09:18,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

870
01:09:18,775 --> 01:09:24,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's topic, thing I most want to happen in gaming in 2010.

871
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: This could get very interesting because as you know, sometimes we're serious and sometimes we're not.

872
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:33,466
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

873
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

874
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:43,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live on this January the 3rd, 2010.

875
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, our first show of the new decade.

876
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:54,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, you could get into that whole argument that the decade doesn't really begin until it's a one because, you know, the first...

877
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:55,347
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

878
01:10:11,653 --> 01:10:12,733
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

879
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, I think, what, in a couple weeks we've got CES, so, I mean, everybody needs that.

880
01:10:41,963 --> 01:10:42,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true.

881
01:10:42,584 --> 01:10:44,565
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be, there's sometimes a surprise or two.

882
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:48,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, CES is more of, like, the TVs and the home devices.

883
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:50,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's technology, but, hey, you know.

884
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some gaming things that come out of that, but, like, or you might see AIBO 2.

885
01:10:55,074 --> 01:10:55,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.

886
01:10:55,354 --> 01:10:57,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think we'll see AIBO 2.

887
01:10:57,856 --> 01:10:59,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we will either, but you never know.

888
01:10:59,158 --> 01:10:59,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't bow well.

889
01:10:59,998 --> 01:11:00,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

890
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:02,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Outlook, not good.

891
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:09,636
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Listless coming up later this hour as well, because somebody pointed out to me, you guys haven't done an OLR game in like a year.

892
01:11:09,856 --> 01:11:15,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you know, I don't think since we moved to Studio Dark Sakura have we done a single game.

893
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:19,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that is because we're in a tighter space now than we used to be, so we don't have a lot of guests in here.

894
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:19,505
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very rare.

895
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:19,986
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be changing.

896
01:11:20,366 --> 01:11:23,429
[SPEAKER_03]: That hopefully will be changing as we get more guests and etc.

897
01:11:26,141 --> 01:11:29,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

898
01:11:29,883 --> 01:11:32,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, some things did happen, and we'll get into that.

899
01:11:32,504 --> 01:11:34,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll get into Twitter topics after the news.

900
01:11:35,106 --> 01:11:37,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Let those last few tweets come in on Twitter.

901
01:11:37,867 --> 01:11:39,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's do Rapid Fire first.

902
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:43,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we talked about in Part A how we've missed a lot of games that have been coming out.

903
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:48,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know for a fact that I've missed a ton of stuff that's come out on Xbox Live Indie Games.

904
01:11:48,907 --> 01:11:50,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a few games you may want to check out.

905
01:11:51,028 --> 01:11:58,875
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, we've got Office Politics, which is a game you can have for the large sum of 80 Microsoft Points, or $1.

906
01:11:59,155 --> 01:12:03,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's basically kind of an office sim.

907
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not really like a...

908
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: How much you speak on the internet?

909
01:12:27,196 --> 01:12:28,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, all that fun stuff.

910
01:12:29,157 --> 01:12:30,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

911
01:12:30,057 --> 01:12:31,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Ceiling Cat is watching you.

912
01:12:31,497 --> 01:12:32,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Available for a dollar.

913
01:12:32,858 --> 01:12:33,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great price.

914
01:12:35,098 --> 01:12:36,499
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another game, Battle Beat.

915
01:12:37,059 --> 01:12:40,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a... Looks like almost a defense game.

916
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar to, say... Oh, I don't know.

917
01:12:45,101 --> 01:12:45,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

918
01:12:46,906 --> 01:12:47,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

919
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:05,659
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

920
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:37,572
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is also an Xbox game and it's these gerbils like in little blocks and stuff and they make funny faces when you stick bombs next to them.

921
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:38,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a dollar.

922
01:13:38,473 --> 01:13:39,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

923
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They make funny faces when you stick bombs next to them?

924
01:13:42,858 --> 01:13:43,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

925
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:44,840
[SPEAKER_03]: You explode the gerbils?

926
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a little bit like Boom Block.

927
01:13:48,022 --> 01:13:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: How sad!

928
01:13:50,983 --> 01:13:52,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just funny, though.

929
01:13:52,283 --> 01:13:53,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, is that a YouTube you're looking at there?

930
01:13:53,844 --> 01:13:54,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

931
01:13:54,624 --> 01:14:00,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I've got... I know this is terrible radio looking at YouTubes, but I need to see what this is all about.

932
01:14:00,346 --> 01:14:10,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we'll hear some hideous noises through on... So there's all these little turbos, okay.

933
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trapped in little blocks or something.

934
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:14,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You put bombs by them.

935
01:14:16,773 --> 01:14:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You will kneel before Zod!

936
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,564
[SPEAKER_03]: The people, oh yeah, that's right, because they were the people that ended up being the villains in the second movie.

937
01:14:46,105 --> 01:14:46,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

938
01:14:47,486 --> 01:14:50,810
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what these gerbils look like, is they look like they're trapped in the magic mirror.

939
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

940
01:14:55,562 --> 01:15:00,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, you have gerbils and you're supposed to be, I think, knocking them below a line or something like that.

941
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:02,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's cute.

942
01:15:02,788 --> 01:15:09,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't really injure them, but they get scared because they're being flung across the screen and you're detonating bombs next to them.

943
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:10,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, a dollar.

944
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:13,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, $1, 24 levels.

945
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:23,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's a great price for... Amaze Satsuma in our chatroom at chat.originalsradio.com thinks this might have been brought to us by PETA, People Exploding Tasty Animals.

946
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: That was from the chat, not from me Views and opinions do not necessarily reflect You laughed, you're going to hell too I did laugh

947
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:37,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Other things not related to Xbox indie games.

948
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:47,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to the Wii, and this is talk about a blast from the past, Fast Draw Showdown looks like something that could be straight out of Mad Dog McCree.

949
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, kind of is.

950
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:54,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually coming from Digital Leisure, which I believe did Mad Dog McCree release.

951
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

952
01:16:16,448 --> 01:16:20,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when they made Laserdisc games for the sake of making Laserdisc games and nothing more.

953
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:21,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

954
01:16:22,051 --> 01:16:23,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those games were pretty terrible.

955
01:16:23,732 --> 01:16:26,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first CD-ROM games.

956
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:28,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when CD-ROMs were new on the computer?

957
01:16:28,695 --> 01:16:28,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

958
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:37,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made some shittacious, and I'm making up a new word there, shittacious games just because you could have movies.

959
01:16:38,365 --> 01:16:42,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there were some interesting ones in there too, like Return to Zork, I think was one of those games.

960
01:16:42,507 --> 01:16:43,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss Mega Race.

961
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't it have Don Knotts in it or something?

962
01:16:45,828 --> 01:16:46,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Don Knotts.

963
01:16:47,289 --> 01:16:47,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

964
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:48,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it did.

965
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:48,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

966
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:50,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't really play Mega Race.

967
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:51,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That was more your thing.

968
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:52,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Mega Race.

969
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:57,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that game is on GameTap, but that's back when I was using GameTap when it was cooler.

970
01:16:58,234 --> 01:16:59,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say it's there now.

971
01:16:59,374 --> 01:17:00,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

972
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:00,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know.

973
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:07,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of those games that really needed a two-speed CD-ROM, and I had an external...

974
01:17:08,106 --> 01:17:24,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Ass, Single Speed CD-ROM Disk Drive, so it ran kind of slow, and then later on, you know, when I got a newer computer and it had like a, was it a 16 speed CD-ROM drive, which was like lightning fast, you know, it popped in there and the game ran too fast.

975
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:28,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, uh, you know, or, well, I would like to see the WiiWare emulate.

976
01:17:29,058 --> 01:17:33,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember those, uh, speaking of shittacious, remember the, uh, hologram games we had?

977
01:17:33,819 --> 01:17:39,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the, uh, there was a western one, and then I think there was, I think there was only like two hologram games.

978
01:17:40,002 --> 01:17:44,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think there was a western one, I think there was a time-traveling one that you, they had the first levels of western.

979
01:17:44,424 --> 01:17:48,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, maybe that's what I'm thinking, because I could never get past the first level because those games controlled like butt.

980
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:49,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they did.

981
01:17:50,868 --> 01:17:54,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see that crap on WiiWare just for no other reason than it fits.

982
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:58,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when we get our holographic games, I'm sure that'll be like some of the first of the important... I see, I see.

983
01:17:58,753 --> 01:18:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: When we get to the holodeck, I'll be able to play that game all over again and all its... And then you can go, fuck this shit and throw it across the room because it's virtual and you can do that.

984
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:17,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitstun in our chatroom at chat.orange.com wants to point out Mega Race 1 and 2 are on GOG.com and they run in DOSBox.

985
01:18:19,412 --> 01:18:19,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

986
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:27,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think that they should make an indie game called Fuck This Shit where you throw controllers at things and that would be funny.

987
01:18:29,406 --> 01:18:30,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they're Wiimotes.

988
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:36,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Nintendo is really trying hard to get away from that image of the Wiimotes going into televisions.

989
01:18:37,031 --> 01:18:37,891
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hilarious.

990
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:43,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And this week on the Rock Band Music Store... Sorry, real quick.

991
01:18:43,795 --> 01:18:45,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that would get on to Xbox Live Indie games?

992
01:18:46,057 --> 01:18:47,178
[SPEAKER_03]: A game called Fuck This Shit?

993
01:18:47,498 --> 01:18:50,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you obviously would have to, you know... Freak this stuff!

994
01:18:52,481 --> 01:18:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Frack this...

995
01:18:56,775 --> 01:18:57,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot.

996
01:18:57,596 --> 01:18:58,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Frack this.

997
01:18:58,196 --> 01:18:58,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot.

998
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:01,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

999
01:19:01,398 --> 01:19:01,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent pending.

1000
01:19:03,499 --> 01:19:04,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band this week.

1001
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we've talked about this for a few weeks now.

1002
01:19:07,062 --> 01:19:07,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Different things coming.

1003
01:19:08,402 --> 01:19:12,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Including the Paul McCartney download pack, which I saw commercials for this.

1004
01:19:13,566 --> 01:19:18,269
[SPEAKER_04]: They are actually advertising download content on VH1 and stuff.

1005
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:18,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1006
01:19:18,809 --> 01:19:19,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.

1007
01:19:19,269 --> 01:19:20,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what?

1008
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Paul McCartney, so I guess maybe that's why.

1009
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's kind of a big deal when it's Paul McCartney.

1010
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Three songs, I mean, come on.

1011
01:19:28,921 --> 01:19:34,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they've got Life Pack, including Band on the Run, Jet, and Sing the Changes.

1012
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of those available for two bucks, 160 Microsoft points, or...

1013
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:40,552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1014
01:20:10,373 --> 01:20:11,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, that's been pretty fun.

1015
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:36,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody did kind of think about it.

1016
01:20:36,422 --> 01:20:41,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the game isn't called Fuck This Shit, but there's... It probably will be after you play it.

1017
01:20:42,288 --> 01:20:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck this shit.

1018
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:43,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Why'd I pay for this?

1019
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:45,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

1020
01:20:46,735 --> 01:20:47,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows, who knows.

1021
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:52,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about some other quick news topics this week.

1022
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki brought up Plants vs. Zombies earlier, and I know some rumors have come up before about the game coming over to iPhone.

1023
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it does sound like it is happening.

1024
01:21:00,461 --> 01:21:03,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be coming to the iPhone, and of course that means the iPod Touch as well.

1025
01:21:04,363 --> 01:21:06,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Late January is what they're saying.

1026
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:08,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from PopCap's Facebook page.

1027
01:21:09,305 --> 01:21:14,167
[SPEAKER_03]: No word yet if Apple's approval process will fuck all that shit up.

1028
01:21:15,548 --> 01:21:19,771
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ David, and I always mispronounce his last name, Guetta, I think is how you say it.

1029
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:20,672
[SPEAKER_03]: David Guetta, of course.

1030
01:21:21,012 --> 01:21:23,454
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a download pack available in DJ Hero.

1031
01:21:23,495 --> 01:21:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play some of his songs.

1032
01:21:24,836 --> 01:21:30,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And the odd thing about it is it's some of the rare songs in the games that aren't mixed with anything.

1033
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:34,684
[SPEAKER_03]: They're remixes of those songs, but they're not mashups.

1034
01:21:35,164 --> 01:21:38,868
[SPEAKER_03]: There's very, very few songs in DJ Hero like that, but all those track pack songs are.

1035
01:21:38,888 --> 01:21:39,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I should go back and play that.

1036
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:41,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually downloaded it and never played it.

1037
01:21:41,650 --> 01:22:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know the very last song in the game I don't think this is a spoiler The very very last thing you unlock is Herbie Hancock's Rocket With like all that insane scratching Yeah That's the last song that you get And it is hell Like it isn't mixed with anything Because the song by itself is Like when I first played it you know what I said Fuck this shit that's what I said It's the one song in the game I can't get more than like two stars on On hard

1038
01:22:10,245 --> 01:22:14,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, back to David Guetta, because I liked his songs quite a bit that were in the download pack.

1039
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:20,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently he is actually working on what he called the number two version of the game.

1040
01:22:20,598 --> 01:22:22,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he means the poop version.

1041
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he actually means DJ Hero 2, which you could read as some type of confirmation of

1042
01:22:27,487 --> 01:22:30,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1043
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:51,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Ogre Battle 64

1044
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:00,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirby Star Stacker

1045
01:23:28,499 --> 01:23:46,768
[SPEAKER_03]: and Salamander and Parodius for the MSX because remember they get they get MSX over there which we have yet to get probably because those games aren't in English at all at all although I really wish we would get the MSX games because you know what that means we could get is Gartic

1046
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:53,123
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1047
01:23:53,584 --> 01:23:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff.

1048
01:23:56,165 --> 01:24:02,650
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a new trademark from Sega, Let's Go Island.

1049
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:08,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Which the theory is that it might be a sequel to Let's Go Jungle.

1050
01:24:09,674 --> 01:24:09,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1051
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:19,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows, but basically the way that Let's Go Jungle was, was you had guns and you shot your way through the jungle.

1052
01:24:19,579 --> 01:24:24,682
[SPEAKER_01]: It was... Though it's a potential, though, that this is going to be one for the Wii.

1053
01:24:25,162 --> 01:24:25,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be.

1054
01:24:26,343 --> 01:24:26,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows.

1055
01:24:28,746 --> 01:24:36,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Microsoft wants avatars to reflect actual physical characteristics.

1056
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:44,316
[SPEAKER_01]: They've put out a patent application for, quote, avatar individualized by physical characteristics.

1057
01:24:45,117 --> 01:24:51,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to eliminate the artificial look and make it look like someone actually really looks.

1058
01:24:51,781 --> 01:24:53,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1059
01:24:55,219 --> 01:25:07,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure how they're going to pull that up, but they're basically saying that they want to have a bit more reality in the game and actually be able to portray people accurately.

1060
01:25:09,211 --> 01:25:16,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they're basically going to be pulling actual health data, and you can spend points on it.

1061
01:25:17,031 --> 01:25:27,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some controversy behind this, because I seem to remember hearing somewhere that this ties into, like, you know, hey fatty, stop playing the game, basically.

1062
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:32,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that that could be the next development, which would suck, because, you know, people should be able to do what they want.

1063
01:25:34,447 --> 01:26:02,240
[SPEAKER_01]: well there's now well a pachinko game that is Castlevania it's Castlevania Pachislot which is a pachinko and slot machine and it has a story where you are Trevor Belmont challenging Dracula and being helped by Angela who's a sorceress and it actually you can buy the soundtrack to the game too it's pretty kinda

1064
01:26:04,181 --> 01:26:05,242
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even a video of it.

1065
01:26:05,262 --> 01:26:05,802
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.

1066
01:26:06,803 --> 01:26:09,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know there's a Gradius Pachinko.

1067
01:26:10,626 --> 01:26:13,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised this is the first Castlevania Pachinko machine.

1068
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:21,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's also a Parodius one too that I've actually found a playthrough about.

1069
01:26:22,234 --> 01:26:22,974
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty neat.

1070
01:26:24,275 --> 01:26:28,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be surprised if this is the first because keep in mind that Konami does slot machines.

1071
01:26:30,003 --> 01:26:30,683
[SPEAKER_03]: is a big business here.

1072
01:26:30,703 --> 01:26:32,324
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually got pretty cool graphics.

1073
01:26:32,364 --> 01:26:35,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming it could beat pachinko machines over in Japan because we don't really see those here.

1074
01:26:35,846 --> 01:26:38,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have seen Konami slot machines here in the US.

1075
01:26:38,467 --> 01:26:40,128
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually pretty hot.

1076
01:26:40,948 --> 01:26:41,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1077
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they actually do a good game like this?

1078
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:45,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking.

1079
01:26:46,751 --> 01:26:49,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks better than a lot of the games that have come out recently.

1080
01:26:49,312 --> 01:26:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Judgment?

1081
01:26:51,894 --> 01:26:54,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like Judgment.

1082
01:26:54,115 --> 01:26:55,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the Twitter.

1083
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:58,037
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Judgment would have been really good on the PlayStation 1.

1084
01:27:00,486 --> 01:27:00,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1085
01:27:16,132 --> 01:27:16,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1086
01:27:33,646 --> 01:27:33,926
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.

1087
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Zelda will also be a big one.

1088
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:35,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1089
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:00,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it has to be necessarily first party either.

1090
01:28:00,339 --> 01:28:08,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, when we bring up kind of these third party Activision and so forth, I think you could have something that's kind of on multiple systems because Modern Warfare was probably the biggest seller, right?

1091
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1092
01:28:10,781 --> 01:28:12,281
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, and that was on multiple systems.

1093
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:14,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1094
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:22,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Von Toxic on Twitter says, If Tinker isn't on your news list, you should mention it.

1095
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:25,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free on Games for Windows Live and it has achievements.

1096
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:30,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Von Toxic might have something to do with this game, but hey, I'm off for free!

1097
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:35,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's Windows New Games On Demand thing, you know, kind of like their Steam competitor type thing.

1098
01:28:37,152 --> 01:28:43,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Do these achievement points kind of blend together with my achievement points on Xbox Live?

1099
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:48,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt they do, because I don't think the PC like Halo 2 had them, and I don't think they blend in.

1100
01:28:48,837 --> 01:28:50,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Grand Theft Auto 4 does.

1101
01:28:51,097 --> 01:28:52,038
[SPEAKER_04]: They have achievements.

1102
01:28:52,558 --> 01:28:52,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1103
01:28:55,762 --> 01:28:56,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

1104
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:59,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it shows up when I play Grand Theft Auto 4.

1105
01:29:00,188 --> 01:29:03,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of pathetic because, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 has no protections on it.

1106
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:07,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it had minimal protections on it, so you can cheat really easy and all of that stuff.

1107
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:11,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like kind of like a puzzly type of game.

1108
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:13,124
[SPEAKER_03]: It uses this little, like, kind of isometry.

1109
01:29:13,144 --> 01:29:13,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like...

1110
01:29:14,969 --> 01:29:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this like some type of reincarnation of Devil's Dice?

1111
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:21,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I noticed it uses dice in kind of an isometric playing field there.

1112
01:29:21,472 --> 01:29:21,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1113
01:29:22,013 --> 01:29:23,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to download this myself and check it out.

1114
01:29:23,533 --> 01:29:24,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for free.

1115
01:29:24,494 --> 01:29:27,835
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like some of these achievement names, like Smack My Switch Up.

1116
01:29:28,616 --> 01:29:30,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Step 1, switch goes left.

1117
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:31,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Step 2, switch goes right.

1118
01:29:31,497 --> 01:29:32,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Step 3, profit.

1119
01:29:33,058 --> 01:29:35,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever that means, that's 10 achievement points right there.

1120
01:29:36,339 --> 01:29:39,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be more than Devil Dice, because I see dominoes, I see little targets.

1121
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:46,723
[SPEAKER_03]: This is clearly some type of little puzzle game based off toys you would find in a kid's room type of thing.

1122
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:51,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's Tinker, and I'm all for free, so I'll have to check that out for next week.

1123
01:29:55,737 --> 01:30:01,784
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw sent us a list of Xbox Live games for mobile phones.

1124
01:30:01,924 --> 01:30:04,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's something being looked at.

1125
01:30:05,228 --> 01:30:13,697
[SPEAKER_03]: He's linking us to an article from MTV's multiplayer blog, saying that Microsoft wants to do more between Xbox Live and Windows Mobile-enabled devices.

1126
01:30:14,177 --> 01:30:15,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, anything to...

1127
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Nickel and Dime at the iPhone and kind of get back at them for that.

1128
01:30:20,022 --> 01:30:27,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about avatars on the phones, being able to do Xbox Live, social media, multi-screen experiences.

1129
01:30:28,228 --> 01:30:35,553
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hiring what's called a principal program manager that's going to drive the platform and bring Xbox Live enabled games to Windows Mobile.

1130
01:30:35,893 --> 01:30:42,137
[SPEAKER_03]: You know when I hear this, I kind of think about like the whole like, remember the Fable pub games that tied into Fable 2?

1131
01:30:43,218 --> 01:30:45,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see something like that happening with this.

1132
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:51,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a mobile game that kind of enhances an existing game but doesn't necessarily take the place of it, if that makes sense.

1133
01:30:53,226 --> 01:30:57,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if they tie it into one of their big franchises, I'm sure it could be quite the big thing.

1134
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:04,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Maren Marvel, a good friend of ours, says, Final Fantasy IV The After Years is a fun bit of nostalgia.

1135
01:31:04,615 --> 01:31:08,037
[SPEAKER_03]: What other series would you play an After Years game for?

1136
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:08,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?

1137
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:09,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VI.

1138
01:31:10,828 --> 01:31:12,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, anything else you'd like to see?

1139
01:31:12,409 --> 01:31:19,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a retro, sequel, episodic, nostalgic, tickle your nostalgia bone type of game?

1140
01:31:19,614 --> 01:31:20,495
[SPEAKER_03]: For Final Fantasy?

1141
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything, really.

1142
01:31:22,196 --> 01:31:26,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Final Fantasy 4, she happened to name Final Fantasy 6, but I don't think, I think we can name anything.

1143
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see a new chip.

1144
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see a new

1145
01:31:28,911 --> 01:31:30,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking the same thing, DarkSakura, Chrono Trigger.

1146
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:32,292
[SPEAKER_03]: A good one.

1147
01:31:32,512 --> 01:31:34,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something in that same vein.

1148
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:40,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically enough, I don't know if it would be after years because Chrono Trigger was all over the map, but that would be awesome.

1149
01:31:40,414 --> 01:31:46,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a new Jet Moto game.

1150
01:31:47,616 --> 01:31:48,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It's old enough by now.

1151
01:31:49,756 --> 01:31:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking more like a story kind of based thing, but I guess anything works.

1152
01:31:54,062 --> 01:32:01,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Story-based game, uh... You know, these role-playing games that never really got fully realized, you know, maybe should have a sequel.

1153
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see an actual Xenogears sequel.

1154
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:06,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenosaga, eh... Not so much.

1155
01:32:08,578 --> 01:32:09,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, um...

1156
01:32:12,816 --> 01:32:17,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually reading our chat room here on Pachinko machines.

1157
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:20,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking, kind of catching up on our chat room, chat.orangeonstranger.com.

1158
01:32:20,678 --> 01:32:25,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting perspective from Akuma JP because he lives over in Japan and kind of gives us some perspective.

1159
01:32:25,759 --> 01:32:27,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have a couple folks that listen in Japan.

1160
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:27,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great.

1161
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,121
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Pachinko and arcade is different store here in Tokyo.

1162
01:32:32,441 --> 01:32:39,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Pachinko is bad because it's gambling and Pachinko can look good because the developer cost is different and the limit for developers is different too.

1163
01:32:39,843 --> 01:32:41,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So Pachinko is mostly computers.

1164
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:44,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize they separated that in Japan.

1165
01:32:45,164 --> 01:32:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That pachinkos and arcade machines were kind of in different places.

1166
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:48,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it makes sense.

1167
01:32:48,405 --> 01:32:53,467
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have slot machines next to Street Fighter 4 here in the States.

1168
01:32:53,767 --> 01:32:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time...

1169
01:32:56,167 --> 01:33:02,391
[SPEAKER_03]: We have things that are practically like little kid gambling devices, but they give you tickets.

1170
01:33:02,431 --> 01:33:03,892
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't give you money, they give you tickets.

1171
01:33:04,273 --> 01:33:08,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And those have taken over arcades, sadly, in the past 10 years.

1172
01:33:08,175 --> 01:33:09,556
[SPEAKER_03]: These arcades have kind of been dying out.

1173
01:33:09,836 --> 01:33:12,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You see more and more ticket spitters, I call them.

1174
01:33:12,498 --> 01:33:13,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something like...

1175
01:33:13,999 --> 01:33:24,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit the button when the wheel is in a certain spot and this one little sliver will give you the jackpot whereas the things around it only give you like four tickets and then you trade your tickets in for crap prizes.

1176
01:33:25,002 --> 01:33:27,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's kind of what we have instead of Pachinko.

1177
01:33:28,243 --> 01:33:28,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1178
01:33:30,584 --> 01:33:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1179
01:33:30,924 --> 01:33:35,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the Twitter, Dan Shadow asks, What do you think of Bayonetta's sexiness?

1180
01:33:35,586 --> 01:33:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the one-handed mode too much?

1181
01:33:37,706 --> 01:33:39,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there really a one-handed mode or is that a joke?

1182
01:33:39,587 --> 01:33:40,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one-button mode.

1183
01:33:40,727 --> 01:33:41,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

1184
01:33:43,628 --> 01:33:43,708
[SPEAKER_04]: And

1185
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1186
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:13,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a show tip from Spazinator, wanting to know that... Hold on, it got cut off.

1187
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:14,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to reload the Twitter here.

1188
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:16,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, folks.

1189
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:18,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes things screw up.

1190
01:34:19,173 --> 01:34:22,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we got some late tweets and it threw everything off.

1191
01:34:22,876 --> 01:34:25,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Spaznair says, here's an idea for an unofficial game.

1192
01:34:26,018 --> 01:34:32,742
[SPEAKER_03]: While in a story, blurt out a random, odd, and unrelated thing to say to see if anyone is paying attention and notices.

1193
01:34:33,182 --> 01:34:37,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you three like tangents and randomness, so here's the chance to essentially make a game of it.

1194
01:34:37,565 --> 01:34:39,346
[SPEAKER_03]: As if this show doesn't get derailed enough.

1195
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:41,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that kind of already happen?

1196
01:34:42,368 --> 01:34:43,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's called this show.

1197
01:34:43,869 --> 01:34:45,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that's kind of what the show's based on.

1198
01:34:45,509 --> 01:34:49,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I like where you're going with that, but that's kind of been the longest running game on this show.

1199
01:34:50,412 --> 01:34:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

1200
01:34:52,942 --> 01:34:58,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Noir says, how about suggestions for mobile games for smartphones other than the iPhone?

1201
01:34:58,484 --> 01:34:58,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1202
01:34:59,365 --> 01:35:02,006
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tricky one for me to answer because I have an iPhone.

1203
01:35:02,046 --> 01:35:03,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I know DarkSakura has an iPhone.

1204
01:35:03,566 --> 01:35:04,066
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sheep.

1205
01:35:04,527 --> 01:35:07,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki doesn't have an iPhone, but you don't really use a fancy phone, do you?

1206
01:35:08,008 --> 01:35:09,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I hardly use my phone.

1207
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:10,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your phone's never even on.

1208
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:12,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on all the time, actually.

1209
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:12,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

1210
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,271
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1211
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:39,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, so sadly, because of that, I would feel kind of ridiculous giving you other game recommendations when I haven't played any of them.

1212
01:35:39,747 --> 01:35:42,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have to turn to the chat to help us answer that one.

1213
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:49,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room, do you guys have any suggestions for Dr. Noir about what games he should be playing on a smartphone that's not an iPhone?

1214
01:35:50,237 --> 01:35:51,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would be curious about that.

1215
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:55,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Amiga777 in chat says, Y'all got iPhones?

1216
01:35:55,602 --> 01:35:56,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I demand an OLR app.

1217
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:57,738
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP App

1218
01:36:19,304 --> 01:36:20,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Caglom for BlackBerry

1219
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:50,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Deathwishing says, did you know that you can unlock a next-gen filter in Uncharted 2?

1220
01:36:50,676 --> 01:36:51,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes everything browner.

1221
01:36:51,838 --> 01:36:51,938
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1222
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:52,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't heard of that.

1223
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just for a look?

1224
01:37:06,641 --> 01:37:12,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a joke, probably, because their game is so colorful and vibrant and all the other games are kind of brown and murky.

1225
01:37:12,884 --> 01:37:13,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it now.

1226
01:37:14,505 --> 01:37:14,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1227
01:37:14,945 --> 01:37:21,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray Iannami says, Eight on the Brakes DJ Max Technica machine now has the Platinum Crew online service.

1228
01:37:21,469 --> 01:37:23,190
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a machine I haven't touched in a while.

1229
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:24,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really been to Roseville Golf Land in a while.

1230
01:37:24,991 --> 01:37:26,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember they had one of those machines.

1231
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if they still do.

1232
01:37:27,972 --> 01:37:29,993
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty broken by now.

1233
01:37:31,374 --> 01:37:34,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's some new songs and some stuff that was unlocked there.

1234
01:37:34,355 --> 01:37:42,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of cool that there's still some arcades in America, at least somewhere, even if you have to go all the way to New Jersey to play them, that will do those cool little unlocks and online things.

1235
01:37:43,178 --> 01:37:44,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So, apparently there was a huge line there.

1236
01:37:44,938 --> 01:37:45,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check that out.

1237
01:37:47,259 --> 01:37:47,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1238
01:37:47,879 --> 01:37:50,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and move back into some gaming news.

1239
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:55,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Listless coming right up, but we have just a few more stories for you guys before we get there.

1240
01:37:56,602 --> 01:37:56,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1241
01:37:57,462 --> 01:38:00,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Including, and this is kind of neat, a brand new

1242
01:38:01,072 --> 01:38:03,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle Kid Fortress of Peril

1243
01:38:21,122 --> 01:38:23,044
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1244
01:38:43,447 --> 01:38:43,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Cartridge Release

1245
01:39:02,908 --> 01:39:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But RetroZone, of course, if you haven't looked at their website in a while, they have wonderful things including reproductions of different games, including the Nintendo World Championships cartridge, the Nintendo College Tour cards, they even have Ultimate Frogger, some Homebrew Glider game, and one that didn't really make our show roll because it's a little late, an 8-bit Xmas cartridge which has a little light show that actually plays in there as well.

1246
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:32,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about that.

1247
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,631
[SPEAKER_03]: That's trippy.

1248
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:35,452
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a neat little Christmas decoration.

1249
01:39:35,772 --> 01:39:38,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's kind of neat.

1250
01:39:39,934 --> 01:39:42,756
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself, though, I'm not sure how much it's being offered for.

1251
01:39:43,176 --> 01:39:48,498
[SPEAKER_04]: My guess is it's going to be probably around $40, which is a little expensive, but hey, you get a cartridge out of it.

1252
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I don't know.

1253
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:58,783
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks pretty hard, so that might be beneficial if you're looking for that, I guess.

1254
01:39:59,404 --> 01:39:59,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1255
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:02,138
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1256
01:40:33,490 --> 01:40:34,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it does look very Mega Man-y.

1257
01:40:38,774 --> 01:40:40,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, those are the boss spells and stuff.

1258
01:40:40,435 --> 01:40:41,336
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different enough.

1259
01:40:42,997 --> 01:40:44,598
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a hack, it's a damn good one.

1260
01:40:44,638 --> 01:40:47,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe they... Yeah, but this inventory thing?

1261
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:48,321
[SPEAKER_03]: That wouldn't have been in a Mega Man game.

1262
01:40:51,123 --> 01:40:53,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you technically did have a kind of inventory.

1263
01:40:54,358 --> 01:40:55,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I don't know.

1264
01:40:55,740 --> 01:41:05,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see this as much of a hack, just as maybe like Mega Man was an inspiration and maybe even some of the stuff comes from it, but I don't know if I'd call it a ROM hack.

1265
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:07,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a ROM hack.

1266
01:41:07,412 --> 01:41:07,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine.

1267
01:41:08,494 --> 01:41:09,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's only one way to tell.

1268
01:41:09,795 --> 01:41:12,476
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some really, really good ROM hacks out there.

1269
01:41:12,597 --> 01:41:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks cool.

1270
01:41:12,897 --> 01:41:13,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks cool.

1271
01:41:13,257 --> 01:41:20,701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a ROM hack of Super Mario Brothers, the first one that actually looks completely different and has a lot of new features added into it.

1272
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:24,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very possible that this is just a ROM hack.

1273
01:41:24,863 --> 01:41:26,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised.

1274
01:41:29,724 --> 01:41:30,464
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1275
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:49,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple friends who are actually going from this area.

1276
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:51,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Seg, who's been on the show before, I know he's going out there.

1277
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:54,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of us have a friend in common.

1278
01:41:54,153 --> 01:41:57,614
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the friend that introduced us, Amanda, is planning on going.

1279
01:41:57,674 --> 01:41:59,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to PAX East with a girl.

1280
01:41:59,155 --> 01:41:59,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, I'm going to have a date.

1281
01:42:00,295 --> 01:42:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am looking at making that happening.

1282
01:42:02,056 --> 01:42:05,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to cross the T's and dot the I's.

1283
01:42:05,897 --> 01:42:07,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't dot the T's or I won't be going.

1284
01:42:08,318 --> 01:42:10,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as I have all the details on that, I'll let you know.

1285
01:42:10,339 --> 01:42:12,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did promise I would try to make that work and it looks like it's going to happen.

1286
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1287
01:42:16,441 --> 01:42:20,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in news, other news, talking about ROM hacks of sorts.

1288
01:42:21,684 --> 01:42:28,207
[SPEAKER_03]: These are fan translations that I guess are at various types of stages right now.

1289
01:42:28,648 --> 01:42:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatal Frame 4, this was a game that was not released over here, but they're doing a fan translation of it right now, and they're talking about doing voiceovers with it.

1290
01:42:36,332 --> 01:42:42,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's a fan translation that has translated 99% of the text, and they're going to do a patch soon so that you can play the game.

1291
01:42:43,095 --> 01:42:44,575
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1292
01:43:03,407 --> 01:43:03,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.

1293
01:43:04,068 --> 01:43:04,408
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

1294
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:08,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Front Mission 5 is also doing a fan translation, and guess what?

1295
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:08,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.

1296
01:43:09,973 --> 01:43:26,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Front Mission was the... 2005, there was the fifth game that came out on the PlayStation 2, and apparently the Front Mission series translation project has taken this long, thousands of hours, 2,000 pages of dialogue to make this game, and it is already...

1297
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:32,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Available and there's even a movie floating around on YouTube where you can actually check it out and it's been subtitled by the group and everything.

1298
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:34,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That is freaking dedication.

1299
01:43:35,331 --> 01:43:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I remember many, many years ago when I was in college and that I think the very, very first major fan translation project that saw fruition was Final Fantasy V. I remember when that came out, that was a big freaking deal because it was like, wow, somebody has done what

1300
01:43:52,322 --> 01:43:53,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Square refused to do.

1301
01:43:53,443 --> 01:43:55,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Seiken 3, also Seiken Densetsu 3.

1302
01:43:55,886 --> 01:43:57,928
[SPEAKER_03]: That was probably the next big, big one that came out.

1303
01:43:57,948 --> 01:44:02,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there were some little games in there that didn't have a lot of text, but yeah, then Seiken Densetsu 3 was a huge one.

1304
01:44:03,935 --> 01:44:10,002
[SPEAKER_01]: They even went so far as to translating sprites in the game.

1305
01:44:10,555 --> 01:44:19,918
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting how far that's come, though, because those are all cartridge-based things where you hack sprites and you change some of the coding to change the kanji letters and the American letters and so forth.

1306
01:44:20,558 --> 01:44:21,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting how far that's come.

1307
01:44:21,678 --> 01:44:24,399
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking about a PlayStation 2 game, that's videos and shit.

1308
01:44:24,439 --> 01:44:25,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hardcore.

1309
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,420
[SPEAKER_03]: No wonder it took so long to do it.

1310
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:28,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a labor of love.

1311
01:44:29,441 --> 01:44:29,941
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree.

1312
01:44:30,761 --> 01:44:31,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1313
01:44:32,962 --> 01:44:35,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that the company should have just paid some people to do, but I guess they didn't want to.

1314
01:44:37,783 --> 01:44:39,324
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story from Jamie, then listless.

1315
01:44:40,512 --> 01:44:41,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Quest Slime Bowling

1316
01:45:01,894 --> 01:45:09,196
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because it's got where you sort of guide it through different, you know, paths and try to land in the right place.

1317
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:11,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got like a bowling mode, it looks like.

1318
01:45:12,857 --> 01:45:14,477
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just interesting.

1319
01:45:16,398 --> 01:45:21,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And what a timely release, too, because we have the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics coming up.

1320
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:23,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, this looks like it might have been influenced.

1321
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:27,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're all going to be glued to the tubes to watch curling.

1322
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting stuff.

1323
01:45:29,121 --> 01:45:29,661
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.

1324
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:34,582
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, you know, as much crap as I give curling, it's actually kind of interesting.

1325
01:45:34,923 --> 01:45:45,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't, maybe, maybe I'm just weird, but it's kind of neat to watch, because, like, sometimes those WTF sports are kind of, I don't know, they make for good watching.

1326
01:45:46,069 --> 01:45:46,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll shut up now.

1327
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:50,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, do you think you'd play that game, though, the DSI game?

1328
01:45:50,452 --> 01:45:50,652
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1329
01:45:53,574 --> 01:45:53,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1330
01:45:55,695 --> 01:46:00,058
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangehauntradio.com says, the OLR game could be about curling.

1331
01:46:01,417 --> 01:46:02,278
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1332
01:46:24,926 --> 01:46:26,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to ring him up.

1333
01:46:26,187 --> 01:46:29,688
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the man who hosts the show before us here on All Games Radio.

1334
01:46:30,168 --> 01:46:36,131
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bobby Blackwolf Show is live at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern on Sunday nights right here at All Games Radio.

1335
01:46:36,151 --> 01:46:36,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, are you there?

1336
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

1337
01:46:38,272 --> 01:46:38,953
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing?

1338
01:46:38,993 --> 01:46:39,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1339
01:46:39,233 --> 01:46:39,873
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Bobby?

1340
01:46:40,733 --> 01:46:41,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good.

1341
01:46:41,654 --> 01:46:49,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for those folks that do listen to us that haven't listened to your show before, something they ought to know is that you always have us on your show every week.

1342
01:46:49,698 --> 01:46:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of do what you call the daily show tease, right?

1343
01:46:54,042 --> 01:46:55,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1344
01:46:55,302 --> 01:47:01,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we get to do our little what's coming up on the Colbert Report segment at the end of the Daily Show.

1345
01:47:01,204 --> 01:47:02,765
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a toss over there.

1346
01:47:02,825 --> 01:47:13,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're always really good to us having us on the show every week, but unfortunately it doesn't really get to work in the reverse because nobody comes on after us on All Games Radio, so we rarely get to have you on.

1347
01:47:13,849 --> 01:47:21,051
[SPEAKER_03]: We do read your comments from chat and so forth, but we're glad to have you here with us tonight to help us with the very first listless of the new decade.

1348
01:47:22,671 --> 01:47:27,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy It's me rambling That's all you need to know You do a really good job selling your show I just want to point that out

1349
01:47:41,511 --> 01:47:55,383
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's basically I go through some issues or things that are going on, and it's me talking and reading chatroom comments for the first 20, 25 minutes, and then I try to take phone calls from people for the last 25 minutes, and then I get to talk to you guys.

1350
01:47:55,964 --> 01:48:05,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically just my take on things that I want to talk about in the games I'm interested in, and people like listening to it, so that's why I keep on doing it.

1351
01:48:05,686 --> 01:48:20,866
[SPEAKER_03]: and you do this show yourself the Bobby Blackwolf show so you don't have anybody to really banter with but your listeners and that's a tough job I don't think people realize how difficult that is that means you have to kind of like actually read chat as you're trying to talk sometimes that's tricky

1352
01:48:22,338 --> 01:48:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's I let dead air happen and then I edit that out of the podcast whenever I put them up.

1353
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to tell them the secret.

1354
01:48:30,681 --> 01:48:31,041
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1355
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:35,183
[SPEAKER_03]: But your show's getting some love there in our chat room from Kitsune.

1356
01:48:35,243 --> 01:48:35,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Bobby's show.

1357
01:48:36,023 --> 01:48:37,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Bobby does a very good show.

1358
01:48:37,784 --> 01:48:42,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get sick of the dick and fart jokes on our show, Bobby's a lot more serious too.

1359
01:48:42,205 --> 01:48:43,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I should point that out.

1360
01:48:43,326 --> 01:48:45,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby keeps it family friendly on his show.

1361
01:48:45,206 --> 01:48:48,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And why would you be getting sick of the dick and fart jokes is what I gotta say.

1362
01:48:49,888 --> 01:48:51,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saving them for you guys.

1363
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:53,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with them.

1364
01:48:54,692 --> 01:48:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I choose not to for that hour.

1365
01:48:57,055 --> 01:48:57,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just fine.

1366
01:48:57,955 --> 01:49:04,101
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want the suitable for broadcast video game podcast, definitely check out Bobby's show.

1367
01:49:04,481 --> 01:49:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons and tons of shows on the All Games Network.

1368
01:49:07,323 --> 01:49:09,485
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growing exponentially.

1369
01:49:10,826 --> 01:49:12,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out at allgames.com.

1370
01:49:12,748 --> 01:49:14,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, you ready to play Listless tonight?

1371
01:49:15,934 --> 01:49:18,035
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, and Bobby Blackwolf

1372
01:49:30,942 --> 01:49:33,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go around and give our top three.

1373
01:49:33,685 --> 01:49:36,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So four times three means we'll have a list of twelve.

1374
01:49:36,968 --> 01:49:38,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Then comes the tricky part.

1375
01:49:38,509 --> 01:49:42,493
[SPEAKER_03]: We all go around the room and we eliminate one thing from the list.

1376
01:49:42,533 --> 01:49:51,642
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes us down to a list of eight, which our chat room will vote on to come up with the definitive list to answer this topic.

1377
01:49:51,662 --> 01:49:52,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight's topic is...

1378
01:49:53,524 --> 01:50:21,756
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing I most want to happen in gaming in 2010 This can be serious, this can be silly, this can be low worthy, this can be Nobel Prize worthy Whatever you want to do, it's up to you What you guys think our listeners would want represented is the thing most wanted in gaming in 2010 So Bobby, my friend, I'm going to let you start, you're the guest tonight, we'll let you go first What would be your number three thing you most want to happen in 2010?

1379
01:50:23,976 --> 01:50:25,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother 3 Localized and Released Legitimately

1380
01:50:37,921 --> 01:50:40,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother 3 localized and released legitimately.

1381
01:50:40,942 --> 01:50:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a damn good pick.

1382
01:50:42,042 --> 01:50:43,543
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hell of a way to start off.

1383
01:50:43,563 --> 01:50:46,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something folks have been looking for for a long time, so very good.

1384
01:50:46,943 --> 01:50:56,326
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, make sure you are in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, because it is the chatters that ultimately take that list of eight and break it down to a list of the top three.

1385
01:50:56,846 --> 01:50:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: What a way to start us off.

1386
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,327
[SPEAKER_03]: A very serious answer there.

1387
01:50:59,387 --> 01:51:01,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, we'll go to you next.

1388
01:51:01,547 --> 01:51:03,408
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your number three pick?

1389
01:51:05,045 --> 01:51:08,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if this would be good, but I'm just going to say it.

1390
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Grand Theft Auto 5 for Project Natal.

1391
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:21,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if I want to do that.

1392
01:51:21,781 --> 01:51:25,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just the fanboy for Grand Theft Auto and you mixed with that?

1393
01:51:25,783 --> 01:51:28,105
[SPEAKER_03]: You just really want to be able to slap a hoe for real.

1394
01:51:28,145 --> 01:51:28,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?

1395
01:51:29,046 --> 01:51:30,487
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that might not be good at all.

1396
01:51:31,567 --> 01:51:32,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking about that now.

1397
01:51:33,068 --> 01:51:34,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be horrible.

1398
01:51:35,029 --> 01:51:36,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to quickly change it?

1399
01:51:36,631 --> 01:51:38,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to quickly change that.

1400
01:51:38,512 --> 01:51:42,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's find something more appropriate for Project Natal here.

1401
01:51:43,075 --> 01:51:43,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1402
01:51:46,144 --> 01:51:53,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be funny to see that Milo kid become, like, a virtual child Sim in, uh, for Project Natal.

1403
01:51:55,086 --> 01:51:56,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it'd be funny to torture that kid.

1404
01:51:57,047 --> 01:51:59,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Milo becomes Sim baby?

1405
01:51:59,368 --> 01:52:00,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what am I calling this?

1406
01:52:00,148 --> 01:52:00,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Sim child.

1407
01:52:01,068 --> 01:52:01,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1408
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:08,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so hungry!

1409
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:09,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Tough, you're not real.

1410
01:52:10,851 --> 01:52:11,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Starve.

1411
01:52:12,211 --> 01:52:15,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Milo becomes Sim child on Natal.

1412
01:52:15,979 --> 01:52:20,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Loki, did you do your homework before tonight's show or are you just doing it in class?

1413
01:52:20,342 --> 01:52:24,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura, what is your number three pick?

1414
01:52:25,005 --> 01:52:26,105
[SPEAKER_01]: A real Silent Hill game.

1415
01:52:27,506 --> 01:52:29,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, so none of this homecoming garbage, huh?

1416
01:52:30,228 --> 01:52:33,069
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and even Shattered Memories isn't really Silent Hill.

1417
01:52:33,189 --> 01:52:35,871
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like, um, I don't want to spoil it.

1418
01:52:36,552 --> 01:52:36,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1419
01:52:37,212 --> 01:52:39,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so a real Silent Hill game, says DarkSakura.

1420
01:52:39,934 --> 01:52:40,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1421
01:52:41,249 --> 01:52:46,733
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick is, funny enough, extremely similar to what DarkSakura picked, yet very different.

1422
01:52:47,113 --> 01:52:48,834
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick is also a serious pick.

1423
01:52:49,314 --> 01:52:58,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Akira Yamaoka, now that he's left Konami, I want him to start a development studio and announce a new survival horror franchise.

1424
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:07,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because obviously he can't do Silent Hill if Konami still has that, but I would like to see Akira Yamaoka start a development studio and announce a new survival horror franchise.

1425
01:53:08,487 --> 01:53:10,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, is that a game you'd like to see happen, or what?

1426
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:19,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see this and I know everybody out there will agree Eye of Judgment finally sells 1 million units.

1427
01:53:42,179 --> 01:53:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd have to actually start manufacturing them again.

1428
01:53:45,002 --> 01:53:47,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, he can do anything he wants.

1429
01:53:47,945 --> 01:53:55,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they will have a new game this year or something where the interest in the old game just comes back.

1430
01:53:55,212 --> 01:53:58,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Valkyria Chronicles took like six months to catch on.

1431
01:53:59,016 --> 01:54:00,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe this is like that where...

1432
01:54:02,915 --> 01:54:05,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes six years to catch on, that's fine.

1433
01:54:05,296 --> 01:54:09,559
[SPEAKER_03]: If it goes into Best Hits, Loki, those Best Hits copies are going to count.

1434
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:11,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's still the same game.

1435
01:54:12,601 --> 01:54:13,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true, that is true.

1436
01:54:13,762 --> 01:54:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we got something.

1437
01:54:15,423 --> 01:54:18,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never going to happen because it has to sell a million copies.

1438
01:54:18,706 --> 01:54:22,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I want, that's what it's about.

1439
01:54:22,028 --> 01:54:23,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what we all want, dammit.

1440
01:54:23,769 --> 01:54:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: You better get your wife starting on that Tingle outfit.

1441
01:54:26,876 --> 01:54:27,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.

1442
01:54:27,717 --> 01:54:28,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus, so.

1443
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:29,160
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1444
01:54:29,621 --> 01:54:30,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, fine then.

1445
01:54:30,603 --> 01:54:33,730
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want as your number two thing you most want to see happen this year?

1446
01:54:34,191 --> 01:54:35,032
[SPEAKER_03]: President Cat.

1447
01:54:37,233 --> 01:54:38,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope by some act of...

1448
01:54:55,549 --> 01:54:56,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what.

1449
01:54:56,309 --> 01:54:57,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, think about it.

1450
01:54:57,730 --> 01:55:00,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Invader Zim.

1451
01:55:00,551 --> 01:55:03,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Off TV, but they sell merchandise out the ass.

1452
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,972
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just crazy.

1453
01:55:05,213 --> 01:55:06,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just point this out?

1454
01:55:06,213 --> 01:55:11,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope by some act of I don't know what, we get invited to Nintendo's press conference at E3 this year.

1455
01:55:12,175 --> 01:55:18,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And somehow through another act of I don't know what, lol, haha, that is actually announced by Reggie on stage.

1456
01:55:18,698 --> 01:55:22,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen carefully for the cackling from the audience, because it'll be me.

1457
01:55:24,815 --> 01:55:25,095
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1458
01:55:46,469 --> 01:55:47,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1459
01:56:05,444 --> 01:56:05,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Keytar Hero

1460
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Elton John

1461
01:56:50,262 --> 01:56:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.

1462
01:56:50,782 --> 01:56:51,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero.

1463
01:56:52,224 --> 01:56:53,985
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1464
01:56:54,085 --> 01:56:55,066
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the number two thing.

1465
01:56:55,126 --> 01:57:00,090
[SPEAKER_03]: The number two thing I would like to see happen is also... Actually, funny enough, it has to do with Nintendo at E3.

1466
01:57:00,731 --> 01:57:08,397
[SPEAKER_03]: The number two thing I would like to see happen this year is I want Reggie to apologize at E3 and then for effect, punch a kid in the face.

1467
01:57:10,045 --> 01:57:10,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

1468
01:57:10,605 --> 01:57:20,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to show that they are not about the kids anymore, Reggie's going to come out on stage and say, I am sorry that we've lost our focus, and then to prove it, he's going to punch a kid in the face.

1469
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:23,631
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the number two thing I want to see happen this year.

1470
01:57:25,511 --> 01:57:26,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't you like to see that happen, Loki?

1471
01:57:28,152 --> 01:57:28,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1472
01:57:30,213 --> 01:57:30,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1473
01:57:30,994 --> 01:57:32,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not weird.

1474
01:57:33,995 --> 01:57:34,375
[SPEAKER_03]: A face!

1475
01:57:35,768 --> 01:57:42,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and actually, I'm not going to put this on the list, but Loki could punch the child in his Tingle outfit after announcing President Cat.

1476
01:57:42,914 --> 01:57:43,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I would be down with it.

1477
01:57:46,883 --> 01:57:47,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you would be.

1478
01:57:47,704 --> 01:58:11,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so, so far, just to let you know where we're at in case you're just joining us, the list so far, thing we most want to see in 2010, Mother 3 localized and released, Milo becomes Sim Child on the tall, a real Silent Hill game, Akira Yamaoka starts a studio and does a new horror game, Eye of Judgment sells 1 million copies, President Cat for the Wii, Keytar Hero, and Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face.

1479
01:58:12,381 --> 01:58:13,862
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so now this is it.

1480
01:58:13,882 --> 01:58:17,603
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one thing you want to see happen in gaming this year.

1481
01:58:18,343 --> 01:58:19,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, what is it?

1482
01:58:19,663 --> 01:58:20,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.

1483
01:58:21,624 --> 01:58:29,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Game companies everywhere realize that first-person shooters are oversaturating the market and begin to turn all those franchises into dating sims.

1484
01:58:33,168 --> 01:58:33,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I approve.

1485
01:58:33,968 --> 01:58:34,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.

1486
01:58:34,728 --> 01:58:36,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to have to shorten that.

1487
01:58:36,589 --> 01:58:39,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to put first-person shooters turned into dating sims.

1488
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:40,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But you all know what Bobby means.

1489
01:58:42,677 --> 01:58:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be at the top of your list for that?

1490
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:51,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, something about the pink Spartan in Halo, you know, romancing her.

1491
01:58:51,743 --> 01:58:52,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1492
01:58:52,323 --> 01:58:52,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1493
01:58:52,604 --> 01:58:54,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so first-person shooters turn to dating sims.

1494
01:58:54,925 --> 01:58:55,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1495
01:58:55,285 --> 01:58:55,586
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

1496
01:58:56,417 --> 01:58:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, number one answer.

1497
01:58:58,658 --> 01:59:00,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what would be your number one answer?

1498
01:59:00,419 --> 01:59:04,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have anything that I could go with, I guess.

1499
01:59:04,401 --> 01:59:06,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I didn't do my homework.

1500
01:59:07,682 --> 01:59:11,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So... They do yell things in chat.

1501
01:59:11,324 --> 01:59:13,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes chat works... Yeah, but I'm not reading chat.

1502
01:59:13,145 --> 01:59:13,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine.

1503
01:59:15,166 --> 01:59:17,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew that it's right

1504
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:42,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Sony has another press conference that sparks a bunch of wonderful memes again, you know, like Ridge Razor.

1505
01:59:42,673 --> 01:59:48,035
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I hope they have a giant enemy crab come out on stage to announce a game for Sony.

1506
01:59:49,715 --> 01:59:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to be in on the joke.

1507
01:59:51,896 --> 01:59:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Or their next console could be shaped like a giant enemy crab, that'd be funny too.

1508
01:59:54,397 --> 02:00:01,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, since you need to pick one thing, I'm going to say Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference, like actually comes out on stage and presents something.

1509
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:02,520
[SPEAKER_03]: In a tuxedo.

1510
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:03,060
[SPEAKER_03]: In a tuxedo.

1511
02:00:04,861 --> 02:00:06,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not writing that, but you'll just know it's there.

1512
02:00:06,581 --> 02:00:06,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.

1513
02:00:07,582 --> 02:00:10,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura, it's your turn.

1514
02:00:11,203 --> 02:00:14,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The numero uno thing you most want to happen in gaming in 2010.

1515
02:00:15,324 --> 02:00:16,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Half-Life 2, Episode 3.

1516
02:00:19,005 --> 02:00:19,945
[SPEAKER_01]: With the portal gun.

1517
02:00:20,665 --> 02:00:21,905
[SPEAKER_03]: About fucking time, huh?

1518
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:24,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's supposed to come out anyway, but I want the portal gun in it.

1519
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:28,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, a somewhat serious one.

1520
02:00:28,671 --> 02:00:30,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks have been looking for this for a long time.

1521
02:00:30,311 --> 02:00:31,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2 and Episode 3.

1522
02:00:31,752 --> 02:00:36,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, dude, they're going to have the Borealis in it, which is the aperture ship.

1523
02:00:36,853 --> 02:00:37,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my portal gun?

1524
02:00:37,993 --> 02:00:41,654
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just have a mash-up game with all the different Valve franchises together.

1525
02:00:41,694 --> 02:00:46,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you get the portal gun with zombies and, you know, the Team Fortress 2 guys.

1526
02:00:46,375 --> 02:00:46,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary's mod.

1527
02:00:47,556 --> 02:00:48,016
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome.

1528
02:00:48,897 --> 02:00:49,557
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it.

1529
02:00:49,658 --> 02:00:54,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But if Bobby's thing stays too, then Half-Life 2 will become a dating sim.

1530
02:00:55,065 --> 02:00:55,705
[SPEAKER_03]: With a portal gun.

1531
02:00:55,986 --> 02:00:58,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure how that's going to work, but it's going to be funny.

1532
02:00:58,389 --> 02:00:59,090
[SPEAKER_03]: This date sucks.

1533
02:01:02,614 --> 02:01:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick exit.

1534
02:01:06,405 --> 02:01:07,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I like where this is going.

1535
02:01:07,306 --> 02:01:07,966
[SPEAKER_03]: The gravity gun.

1536
02:01:08,006 --> 02:01:08,407
[SPEAKER_03]: The gun!

1537
02:01:12,170 --> 02:01:13,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my number one thing.

1538
02:01:14,091 --> 02:01:19,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I have somewhat a controversial answer, but man, I would just... This would just make me so happy.

1539
02:01:20,036 --> 02:01:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I would just... I would cry tears of joy.

1540
02:01:23,579 --> 02:01:24,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you pee with happiness?

1541
02:01:25,261 --> 02:01:28,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, but, you know, in the toilet, because that's dirty otherwise.

1542
02:01:29,304 --> 02:01:31,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just be so happy if this would actually happen.

1543
02:01:32,006 --> 02:01:34,288
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one thing I would most like to see happen in gaming in 2010...

1544
02:01:35,834 --> 02:01:36,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Xplay gets cancelled.

1545
02:01:37,995 --> 02:01:38,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1546
02:01:40,017 --> 02:01:40,717
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be sweet.

1547
02:01:40,737 --> 02:01:42,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that bad.

1548
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:55,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say that G4 gets cancelled altogether and replaced with the Seacrest Network, but I'm just... Because remember, I have to feel sorry for Xplay because they were part of Tech TV at one time, you know?

1549
02:01:56,227 --> 02:02:02,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, like, I hate to see the last bit of good, you know, Tech TV die off, but...

1550
02:02:04,967 --> 02:02:08,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to admit, I'm just done with the reviews written by interns trying to be funny.

1551
02:02:08,733 --> 02:02:13,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'd like to see him return to, say, an out of ten scale instead of out of five.

1552
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:18,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I give Skye's answer 3 out of 5.

1553
02:02:38,911 --> 02:03:01,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother 3 localized and released, Milo becomes Sim Child on Atal, a real Silent Hill game, Akira Yamaoka starts a studio and does a new horror game, Eye of Judgment sells 1 million copies, President Cat on the Wii, Keitar Hero, Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face, first person shooters turn into dating sims, Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 with a portal gun, and X-Play gets cancelled.

1554
02:03:02,307 --> 02:03:08,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, unfortunately, it's part of the game, one of these has to go, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1555
02:03:10,152 --> 02:03:11,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over it already?

1556
02:03:11,492 --> 02:03:11,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1557
02:03:38,683 --> 02:03:39,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, Bobby.

1558
02:03:40,103 --> 02:03:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1559
02:03:40,403 --> 02:03:42,324
[SPEAKER_03]: For what it's worth, Bobby, I really like that answer.

1560
02:03:42,344 --> 02:03:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.

1561
02:03:43,804 --> 02:03:47,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, but unfortunately, Loki is deemed unworthy of the list and therefore it is gone.

1562
02:03:48,365 --> 02:03:52,606
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1563
02:03:53,766 --> 02:03:55,487
[SPEAKER_01]: First Person Shooters turned to Dating Sims.

1564
02:03:57,527 --> 02:04:00,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did we bring Bobby on the show if we're just going to eliminate all his answers?

1565
02:04:01,968 --> 02:04:05,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Dating Sims are... All you have to do is just go to Japan.

1566
02:04:05,849 --> 02:04:06,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's Dating Sim.

1567
02:04:07,522 --> 02:04:08,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poor Bobby.

1568
02:04:08,402 --> 02:04:09,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Bobby.

1569
02:04:09,342 --> 02:04:12,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for what it's worth, Bobby, I'm going to leave your last one on there, because I liked it.

1570
02:04:13,843 --> 02:04:22,805
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I am going to eliminate, though, the one that I think is not worthy of the list, Milo becomes Sim Child on Natal, because I don't even think Loki knew what that answer was.

1571
02:04:23,025 --> 02:04:25,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the one I'm eliminating from the list.

1572
02:04:25,566 --> 02:04:28,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a way to torture that virtual kid.

1573
02:04:28,646 --> 02:04:35,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, actually, if I think about it, I'm sure they're included in some sort of fable game, and I'll do just the same in that.

1574
02:04:35,608 --> 02:04:35,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1575
02:04:36,448 --> 02:04:36,769
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1576
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:40,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, the eight that the chat room does get to vote on.

1577
02:04:40,413 --> 02:04:44,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, chatters, when you vote, you're going to see... Damn, I should have said Peter Molyneux jumps into a volcano.

1578
02:04:45,018 --> 02:04:45,719
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been better.

1579
02:04:45,859 --> 02:04:46,140
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

1580
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:47,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have eliminated that.

1581
02:04:47,802 --> 02:04:48,643
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here it is, though.

1582
02:04:48,683 --> 02:04:51,286
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the list as it stands.

1583
02:04:52,087 --> 02:04:54,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother 3, localized and released.

1584
02:04:54,730 --> 02:04:57,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Akira Yamaoka starts a studio and does a new horror game.

1585
02:04:58,176 --> 02:04:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: President Cat is on the Wii.

1586
02:05:00,119 --> 02:05:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Keitar Hiro.

1587
02:05:01,481 --> 02:05:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face.

1588
02:05:04,305 --> 02:05:06,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference.

1589
02:05:06,869 --> 02:05:09,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2 Episode 3 is finally released with a portal gun.

1590
02:05:10,214 --> 02:05:12,136
[SPEAKER_03]: and Xplay gets cancelled.

1591
02:05:12,416 --> 02:05:18,041
[SPEAKER_03]: To vote, send a private message to Sky with your number 1 and your number 2 answer.

1592
02:05:18,141 --> 02:05:23,765
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't label what's 1 and 2, I'm going to just assume the first one is your number 1 choice.

1593
02:05:23,945 --> 02:05:31,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So place your vote now and we will tell you what the top 3 were a little later in the show.

1594
02:05:31,932 --> 02:05:34,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And no Bobby, stop telling the chatters to add dating sims.

1595
02:05:35,595 --> 02:05:36,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way the game works.

1596
02:05:37,216 --> 02:05:38,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no longer on the list.

1597
02:05:39,357 --> 02:05:40,018
[SPEAKER_03]: But nothing.

1598
02:05:40,738 --> 02:05:41,018
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1599
02:05:41,759 --> 02:05:42,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be victorious.

1600
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:46,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, thank you so much, though, for playing the list tonight.

1601
02:05:46,682 --> 02:05:49,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Mother 3 one especially was a good one that I completely forgot about.

1602
02:05:49,384 --> 02:05:50,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally am behind that one.

1603
02:05:50,184 --> 02:05:50,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I am behind that, too.

1604
02:05:52,966 --> 02:05:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it funny?

1605
02:05:53,426 --> 02:05:55,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Your serious answer was the one that gets through.

1606
02:05:55,808 --> 02:05:58,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, any other quick plugs for what's going on in your life?

1607
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:00,651
[SPEAKER_03]: You do another show, right, on Friday nights?

1608
02:06:00,771 --> 02:06:02,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about that real quick before I let you go.

1609
02:06:02,967 --> 02:06:03,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday Night Gaming

1610
02:06:21,527 --> 02:06:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: as our welcome back in 2010.

1611
02:06:24,249 --> 02:06:32,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an audio podcast, but it doesn't really work as well because it's very video heavy, but we do it over on Ustream for three hours on Friday nights, fnglive.net.

1612
02:06:32,913 --> 02:06:34,734
[SPEAKER_02]: We also take phone calls.

1613
02:06:34,794 --> 02:06:35,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the chat room.

1614
02:06:36,114 --> 02:06:41,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's an extension of what I do on Sundays, but a little bit more free form, and there are dick and fart jokes in it.

1615
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:42,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, excellent, excellent.

1616
02:06:42,921 --> 02:06:44,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you need your dick and fart jokes on a Friday night.

1617
02:06:45,022 --> 02:06:45,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So very good.

1618
02:06:45,722 --> 02:06:49,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a whole weekend because then Understation Live on Saturday nights, they do a lot of dick and fart jokes too.

1619
02:06:49,464 --> 02:06:52,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get it like every, you know, all through your weekend.

1620
02:06:52,726 --> 02:06:54,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So, excellent.

1621
02:06:54,667 --> 02:07:01,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bobby, thank you so much for joining us tonight and best of luck with your shows and we'll let you know what happens to the list, okay?

1622
02:07:01,930 --> 02:07:02,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, thank you.

1623
02:07:02,551 --> 02:07:03,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Dating sims for everyone.

1624
02:07:03,811 --> 02:07:04,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, take care, Bobby.

1625
02:07:05,592 --> 02:07:05,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in 2011.

1626
02:07:08,208 --> 02:07:15,632
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf, who hosts his own show right before us here on All Games Radio.

1627
02:07:16,092 --> 02:07:25,597
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about going to take us to calls and so forth, but not until we do a very important segment of our show while I tally up the listless votes.

1628
02:07:26,037 --> 02:07:31,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the part of the show where you guys send us emails and we pick a few of our favorites and read them for you guys.

1629
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:33,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the mailbag segment.

1630
02:07:35,202 --> 02:07:37,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Sakura, what kind of emails do we have this week?

1631
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:38,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one.

1632
02:07:39,565 --> 02:07:40,348
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1633
02:07:40,468 --> 02:07:41,210
[SPEAKER_03]: One good one, I hope.

1634
02:07:41,724 --> 02:07:47,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, we shall see if it's good, just gonna take me a moment to get it pulled up, that's all.

1635
02:07:48,848 --> 02:07:52,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is, uh, I'll just start from the beginning.

1636
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:58,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear gamers and OLR crew, um, I'm not going to read the beginning of this.

1637
02:07:58,934 --> 02:08:08,259
[SPEAKER_01]: You were right about the 360, it is gaming heaven, I've never been this immersed in a game since Pokemon Gold on a 15 hour road trip with constant grinding to get to level 100.

1638
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:16,663
[SPEAKER_01]: The three days before I went to the store, I was constantly switching games on my PSP since I decided to kick the Wii out of the gaming cave.

1639
02:08:17,423 --> 02:08:20,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I was switching between GTA and Rainbow Six Vegas and Final Fantasy VI.

1640
02:08:21,605 --> 02:08:30,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally went to the store, a local chain called Gamers, to get the used Xbox 360 Pro with a 20GB hard drive.

1641
02:08:31,028 --> 02:08:38,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what I was jumping into with the problems the system had, so I got a tier extended warranty with the dream of being the MLG-like

1642
02:08:38,772 --> 02:08:41,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, T-Squared, Taylor, whatever.

1643
02:08:43,014 --> 02:08:48,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up Halo 3 in the interest of getting some headbanging done while wailing on my plastic axe.

1644
02:08:48,798 --> 02:08:54,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Guitar Hero Metallica with some Xbox Live points, a $1600 prepaid card.

1645
02:08:55,421 --> 02:08:57,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played Halo 3 for 15 days and it was awesome.

1646
02:08:58,851 --> 02:09:02,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also played Guitar Hero Metallica and gotten the easy achievements all the way first.

1647
02:09:03,034 --> 02:09:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I played Hexic for a few hours and I'm having massive fun with this and my TV had no lag and was able to set it up to 1080i.

1648
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:18,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I popped in Bring It On and Death Note into the DVD drive and it upscaled the DVD to 1080i resolution.

1649
02:09:19,006 --> 02:09:20,887
[SPEAKER_01]: My anime has never looked so good.

1650
02:09:21,755 --> 02:09:24,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Microsoft, for creating the Jesus Box.

1651
02:09:24,757 --> 02:09:30,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the only three things missing to make my purchase complete is a wireless adapter, 12-month gold, and a headset.

1652
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, this machine is the eyes of President Cat.

1653
02:09:33,661 --> 02:09:34,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfect.

1654
02:09:35,282 --> 02:09:36,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, DSMaster26.

1655
02:09:38,284 --> 02:09:38,664
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

1656
02:09:39,164 --> 02:09:44,007
[SPEAKER_01]: This email is sponsored by Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato, the hottest teen stars.

1657
02:09:44,607 --> 02:09:46,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I'd be going out with all three from Disney.

1658
02:09:46,929 --> 02:09:49,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, leave Miley alone and don't criticize her.

1659
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:49,530
[SPEAKER_01]: She's perfect.

1660
02:09:51,226 --> 02:09:52,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe I just said that.

1661
02:09:53,368 --> 02:09:55,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm like, did you really just say that on air?

1662
02:09:55,591 --> 02:09:56,432
[SPEAKER_03]: You got duped.

1663
02:09:57,313 --> 02:09:59,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm reading the damn email.

1664
02:10:01,217 --> 02:10:07,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so I only like half heard that email because I'm tallying the votes, so are there questions for us in there or what?

1665
02:10:08,064 --> 02:10:09,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing if there's anything else in here.

1666
02:10:09,686 --> 02:10:09,886
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1667
02:10:09,906 --> 02:10:09,946
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1668
02:10:13,136 --> 02:10:17,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I would though, now I need to remember what type of headset that we have.

1669
02:10:17,918 --> 02:10:23,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Dan has these cool, like I could sit next to him and not hear the Xbox at all headphones.

1670
02:10:25,241 --> 02:10:25,861
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.

1671
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:26,842
[SPEAKER_01]: They help me sleep at night.

1672
02:10:27,442 --> 02:10:29,003
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the best present he's ever gotten me.

1673
02:10:30,123 --> 02:10:32,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Well technically it's the best present he's ever bought in himself for me.

1674
02:10:34,185 --> 02:10:37,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have though, a little story I could throw in in the interim.

1675
02:10:38,499 --> 02:10:41,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, but let me just quickly say, last call for listless votes.

1676
02:10:41,064 --> 02:10:44,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have one minute to get your listless votes in or they will not be counted.

1677
02:10:44,471 --> 02:10:45,553
[SPEAKER_03]: One minute for listless votes.

1678
02:10:45,674 --> 02:10:47,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Very heavy participation tonight.

1679
02:10:47,517 --> 02:10:48,519
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a good list tonight.

1680
02:10:50,322 --> 02:11:17,383
[SPEAKER_01]: What was going on is basically these geeks, actually Team Osaka from the University of Osaka, submitted to the 2009 Internationally Genetically Engineered Machine Competition these engineered bacteria that produce fluorescent proteins and carotenoid pigments to make art out of them.

1681
02:11:18,309 --> 02:11:21,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made one look like Mario.

1682
02:11:22,332 --> 02:11:25,154
[SPEAKER_01]: They were calling them biobricks.

1683
02:11:26,234 --> 02:11:30,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a picture of Mario made out of bacteria.

1684
02:11:31,838 --> 02:11:32,799
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bacteria.

1685
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: That's freaky.

1686
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetically engineered bacteria.

1687
02:11:37,802 --> 02:11:40,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to link the picture in the chat room.

1688
02:11:40,644 --> 02:11:44,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I make genetically engineered next-gen biobricks.

1689
02:11:45,427 --> 02:11:46,868
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of murky and brown, though.

1690
02:11:48,314 --> 02:11:49,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop being gross.

1691
02:11:54,155 --> 02:12:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to get to the FUs of the week in just a moment here, but I was just putting the final touches there on tonight's list.

1692
02:12:01,597 --> 02:12:05,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it, right after I get them all tallied up, one more freaking vote comes in.

1693
02:12:05,898 --> 02:12:06,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you!

1694
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:10,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's live radio, folks.

1695
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:11,460
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

1696
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,881
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another vote for the number one answer.

1697
02:12:14,901 --> 02:12:16,361
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really going to change things too much.

1698
02:12:19,955 --> 02:12:20,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, live radio, folks.

1699
02:12:22,236 --> 02:12:23,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get to the FUs in just a minute.

1700
02:12:24,878 --> 02:12:26,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted the bacteria, Mario.

1701
02:12:31,921 --> 02:12:32,202
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1702
02:12:33,142 --> 02:12:35,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to the listless results in just a moment.

1703
02:12:35,623 --> 02:12:37,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are first going to get to the FUs of the week.

1704
02:12:37,885 --> 02:12:42,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually have some angst to inspire our FUs of the week.

1705
02:12:42,927 --> 02:12:45,589
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we can start ranting, we need to get our ranty music.

1706
02:12:45,689 --> 02:12:47,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, Schleigwerk, take us away.

1707
02:13:03,117 --> 02:13:06,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something to inspire your ranting tonight in the gaming world.

1708
02:13:07,098 --> 02:13:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another case of the media runs away with some idiot doing something with video games to make the media run away with games are bad, okay?

1709
02:13:15,561 --> 02:13:22,123
[SPEAKER_03]: A nine-year-old boy apparently stabbed to death by a 25-year-old friend over a game of Tony Hawk.

1710
02:13:22,643 --> 02:13:34,591
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, Anthony Maldonado was visiting his family in Harlem and they were playing the new PlayStation and the killer's name was Alejandro Morales, the 25-year-old, I suppose.

1711
02:13:34,912 --> 02:13:42,357
[SPEAKER_03]: The boy's family left the 9-year-old in the care of Alejandro during the night while they were playing the Tony Hawk game and that's when he stabbed him in the chest.

1712
02:13:44,488 --> 02:13:46,649
[SPEAKER_03]: The story goes on to say he was a friend.

1713
02:13:46,689 --> 02:13:47,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe this happened.

1714
02:13:48,530 --> 02:13:51,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony was playing on PlayStation when his friend came in and stabbed him.

1715
02:13:51,611 --> 02:13:53,472
[SPEAKER_03]: My grandson died over a video game.

1716
02:13:54,492 --> 02:13:57,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so sure your grandson died over a video game.

1717
02:13:57,133 --> 02:13:59,754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that you left him under the care of a fucking lunatic.

1718
02:14:00,134 --> 02:14:03,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, you may not have known he was a fucking lunatic.

1719
02:14:03,936 --> 02:14:06,317
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very tragic that he ended up being a fucking lunatic.

1720
02:14:06,757 --> 02:14:09,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But something tells me this really has nothing to do with video games.

1721
02:14:10,658 --> 02:14:12,139
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy, Alejandro...

1722
02:14:13,433 --> 02:14:14,274
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1723
02:14:41,058 --> 02:14:46,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken my vitamins and I feel, you know, still tired, so I'm just extra exhausted.

1724
02:14:47,343 --> 02:14:47,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1725
02:14:49,624 --> 02:14:49,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki?

1726
02:14:50,505 --> 02:14:57,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to KFC for leaving me at the drive-thru window for about ten minutes while they... jacked off, I assume.

1727
02:14:58,050 --> 02:15:00,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, um, then the manager... That's not butter!

1728
02:15:00,292 --> 02:15:02,453
[SPEAKER_04]: The manager comes over and he's like, has anyone come and helped you yet?

1729
02:15:02,493 --> 02:15:04,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, I've been sitting here for ten minutes.

1730
02:15:04,255 --> 02:15:07,457
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh shit, sorry, uh, here's your food.

1731
02:15:08,718 --> 02:15:10,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna charge you for the full thing.

1732
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:11,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, how nice.

1733
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:15,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, except I think he did, so... Whatever.

1734
02:15:16,052 --> 02:15:17,812
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't even get a free cookie for your troubles?

1735
02:15:18,012 --> 02:15:18,292
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1736
02:15:18,412 --> 02:15:18,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards.

1737
02:15:18,853 --> 02:15:20,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But the chicken was good, so it is forgiven.

1738
02:15:21,933 --> 02:15:22,654
[SPEAKER_03]: All is forgiven.

1739
02:15:23,554 --> 02:15:24,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have a lot of FUs this week.

1740
02:15:24,974 --> 02:15:27,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Just FU to my car for being ghetto.

1741
02:15:28,015 --> 02:15:29,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so ghetto.

1742
02:15:30,756 --> 02:15:32,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have a new car soon.

1743
02:15:32,477 --> 02:15:32,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to.

1744
02:15:32,997 --> 02:15:34,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't have a choice at this point.

1745
02:15:35,078 --> 02:15:35,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So FU to my car.

1746
02:15:36,297 --> 02:15:37,238
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have a choice, Rob.

1747
02:15:37,758 --> 02:15:38,458
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a choice.

1748
02:15:38,498 --> 02:15:43,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, I do, but it's starting to get... There is public transportation, Rob.

1749
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:44,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting to borderline pathetic.

1750
02:15:45,062 --> 02:15:49,784
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not taking... I don't live in a city that has very good public transportation.

1751
02:15:49,824 --> 02:15:50,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't live in New York.

1752
02:15:50,725 --> 02:15:53,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I wasn't really serious.

1753
02:15:53,766 --> 02:15:54,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Sacramento.

1754
02:15:56,789 --> 02:16:00,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That is really about it for what we had scripted for tonight's show.

1755
02:16:01,770 --> 02:16:08,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go ahead and turn it over to last-minute stories right after I tell you who won the list list tonight.

1756
02:16:13,872 --> 02:16:17,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, as voted by you, the chatters, the definitive.

1757
02:16:17,372 --> 02:16:17,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is it.

1758
02:16:17,893 --> 02:16:18,933
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no arguing.

1759
02:16:19,513 --> 02:16:20,653
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no disputing.

1760
02:16:20,713 --> 02:16:24,054
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the definitive list of what the public wants in the year 2010 in gaming.

1761
02:16:24,534 --> 02:16:25,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three.

1762
02:16:27,344 --> 02:16:31,246
[SPEAKER_03]: is they want Reggie to apologize at E3 and then punch a kid in the face.

1763
02:16:33,066 --> 02:16:34,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all know he means it.

1764
02:16:35,467 --> 02:16:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only way.

1765
02:16:36,488 --> 02:16:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only way.

1766
02:16:37,248 --> 02:16:38,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't believe him otherwise.

1767
02:16:39,809 --> 02:16:44,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, and I don't want to hear any of this blah, blah, blah, that it's a child, blah, blah, blah.

1768
02:16:45,832 --> 02:16:46,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trust me.

1769
02:16:46,932 --> 02:16:48,673
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of kids out there you've wanted to punch in the face.

1770
02:16:49,393 --> 02:16:50,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a parent to sign off on it.

1771
02:16:51,074 --> 02:16:51,994
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, number two.

1772
02:16:52,414 --> 02:16:54,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The number two thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010...

1773
02:16:56,756 --> 02:16:59,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother 3 is localized and released.

1774
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:02,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bobby gets the last laugh after all.

1775
02:17:02,343 --> 02:17:03,284
[SPEAKER_03]: He ends up on the list there.

1776
02:17:03,564 --> 02:17:06,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother 3 is localized and released is the number two answer on our list tonight.

1777
02:17:07,348 --> 02:17:17,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number one thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010, according to our chatters, President Cat is finally released on the Wii.

1778
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:17,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1779
02:17:20,529 --> 02:17:21,129
[SPEAKER_03]: No surprise there.

1780
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:24,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I just want to point out it wasn't even a freaking close vote tonight.

1781
02:17:24,912 --> 02:17:26,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually these lists are kind of close.

1782
02:17:26,513 --> 02:17:29,495
[SPEAKER_03]: President Cat won in a landslide vote.

1783
02:17:30,016 --> 02:17:41,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feeling, though, the chat room might be thinking that that means that then we would actually announce it at E3 and Loki would wear the Tingle costume, which technically wasn't part of the answer, but I just really like that.

1784
02:17:41,684 --> 02:17:43,405
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe that's what they were voting number one.

1785
02:17:43,425 --> 02:17:43,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1786
02:17:43,765 --> 02:17:44,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it give you the warm fuzzies?

1787
02:17:44,985 --> 02:17:45,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

1788
02:17:45,605 --> 02:17:45,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

1789
02:17:46,326 --> 02:17:47,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see.

1790
02:17:47,646 --> 02:17:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this will be the year for President Cat.

1791
02:17:50,247 --> 02:17:51,648
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 copies, my ass.

1792
02:17:52,548 --> 02:17:53,188
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to say.

1793
02:17:53,368 --> 02:17:55,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 100 copies sold.

1794
02:17:55,129 --> 02:17:55,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1795
02:17:56,429 --> 02:17:56,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1796
02:17:58,450 --> 02:17:58,730
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1797
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:00,591
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1798
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:03,892
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your definitive top three list as voted by the chatters.

1799
02:18:03,952 --> 02:18:06,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby is still trying to dispute the dating sims thing in chat.

1800
02:18:07,033 --> 02:18:07,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it go.

1801
02:18:09,334 --> 02:18:09,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it go.

1802
02:18:10,754 --> 02:18:11,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Step away.

1803
02:18:12,296 --> 02:18:12,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it be.

1804
02:18:13,777 --> 02:18:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, now we'll do some last minute stories and we'll open up the Skype line.

1805
02:18:16,961 --> 02:18:20,805
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1806
02:18:20,865 --> 02:18:23,247
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to your calls right after some last minute stories.

1807
02:18:23,487 --> 02:18:23,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1808
02:18:24,113 --> 02:18:33,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Love, the procedurally generated MMO is starting off with some beta testing, and that's coming to us, I guess, on January 7th.

1809
02:18:34,379 --> 02:18:40,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Until that time, I guess only registrants in the pay-to-play alpha test can log on, though, unfortunately.

1810
02:18:40,603 --> 02:18:42,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of neat, though.

1811
02:18:42,824 --> 02:18:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: The game looks interesting, though, because it's all procedurally generated.

1812
02:18:46,987 --> 02:18:48,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, next week... Hold on, let me get to a call.

1813
02:18:48,528 --> 02:18:49,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Save that thought.

1814
02:18:49,909 --> 02:18:50,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1815
02:18:50,789 --> 02:18:51,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1816
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ray Ayanami.

1817
02:18:54,246 --> 02:18:55,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, we're having a hard time hearing you.

1818
02:18:55,527 --> 02:18:56,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you're speaking loud and clear into the phone.

1819
02:18:57,007 --> 02:18:57,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1820
02:18:59,889 --> 02:19:01,149
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ray Iannami.

1821
02:19:01,309 --> 02:19:01,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better.

1822
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:02,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray, what's on your mind, buddy?

1823
02:19:05,812 --> 02:19:06,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

1824
02:19:06,692 --> 02:19:15,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a bunch of Christmas money like last week, so I've been spending it on some games like Riding 4 and Jewelry Master Twinkle.

1825
02:19:16,557 --> 02:19:17,917
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been playing Riding 4 and what?

1826
02:19:19,758 --> 02:19:20,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Jewelry Master Twinkle.

1827
02:19:21,679 --> 02:19:22,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us... Basically, it's a...

1828
02:19:23,957 --> 02:19:31,345
[SPEAKER_06]: X-Box, Live Indie Games, or there's a PC game called Tetris Meets Puzzle Fighter.

1829
02:19:32,746 --> 02:19:34,288
[SPEAKER_03]: The original PC game is called Dormaster.

1830
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:50,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, 400 Microsoft points, or 5 US dollars.

1831
02:19:50,602 --> 02:19:51,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

1832
02:19:51,762 --> 02:19:53,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's what's going on in your gaming world?

1833
02:19:53,843 --> 02:19:56,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you, uh, you've had a chance to catch up on a lot of stuff over the holidays?

1834
02:19:58,785 --> 02:20:02,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I also got DJ Max 4 with positive quality additions.

1835
02:20:03,347 --> 02:20:03,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1836
02:20:04,788 --> 02:20:15,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Admittedly, part of the reason I wanted to get it was because it doesn't have the stupid autocorrect feature of the newer DJ Max games, where if you hit the wrong note, it'll still give you credit for the note.

1837
02:20:20,231 --> 02:20:26,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was able to log all the talks on it within a few days, and nothing too difficult.

1838
02:20:26,819 --> 02:20:34,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And the charts are pretty easy, but then again, this is a game geared towards new players, so I don't hold a grudge against any business with that.

1839
02:20:36,039 --> 02:20:37,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard anything, and...

1840
02:21:00,262 --> 02:21:07,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if there were plans to make a Titanic a port for home, it would be really hard considering the setup of the arcade game.

1841
02:21:08,026 --> 02:21:15,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we were to put it on DS, you would have to dumb down the experience since the DS can't support more than two fingerprints at once.

1842
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:19,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it might work on a motion control type thing?

1843
02:21:19,991 --> 02:21:23,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe if it was pointing at the screen like on the Wii or Natal or something?

1844
02:21:23,833 --> 02:21:25,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that going to just change it too much?

1845
02:21:27,199 --> 02:21:28,279
[SPEAKER_06]: They've probably changed it too much.

1846
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii Remote would be like not the size enough for that kind of stuff.

1847
02:21:32,761 --> 02:21:35,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Escalator 2, which is also a cave shooter, is getting released soon by the

1848
02:21:53,985 --> 02:22:00,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Also published by Cave and ported by M2, the same people behind Castlevania Adventure Rebirth, which did not last until I got it downloaded.

1849
02:22:02,909 --> 02:22:05,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of curiosity, did you play Ikaruga this week too?

1850
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:06,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it seems like everybody else did but me.

1851
02:22:08,051 --> 02:22:09,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play Ikaruga.

1852
02:22:10,212 --> 02:22:10,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it?

1853
02:22:10,732 --> 02:22:13,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it against Ikaruga, but I haven't touched it in years now.

1854
02:22:13,853 --> 02:22:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1855
02:22:14,234 --> 02:22:15,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough.

1856
02:22:15,734 --> 02:22:18,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you would be intensely pissed off by it.

1857
02:22:20,456 --> 02:22:21,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else?

1858
02:22:21,096 --> 02:22:21,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

1859
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:31,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to play it just to survive, but then I keep hearing the robotic words going, one chain, one chain, and that pisses me off.

1860
02:22:31,705 --> 02:22:34,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me how bad I am at chaining the game.

1861
02:22:36,767 --> 02:22:38,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very frustrating game.

1862
02:22:38,428 --> 02:22:48,574
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to... I think it's one of those ones that you have to have the experience of playing it so that you start realizing what's coming where, and then it's more just one of those technical games.

1863
02:22:50,543 --> 02:22:54,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's, like, more memorization-based than, like, many other shooters.

1864
02:22:54,804 --> 02:22:57,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's more memorization-based than just, like, scoring.

1865
02:22:57,885 --> 02:23:00,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, like, in terms of survival, like, R-Type and such.

1866
02:23:01,605 --> 02:23:07,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, R-Type, I still think, is a little bit less of a challenge than Ikaruga.

1867
02:23:08,667 --> 02:23:19,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of R-Type, the R-Type dimensions on 360 can... I still refuse to play it because if I try to put it on my arcade stick, I...

1868
02:23:21,091 --> 02:23:28,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be able to change the controls since A is below X, so I'd rather have to put my fingers in a rather awkward position just to be able to play.

1869
02:23:28,935 --> 02:23:31,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Because A is the fire and X is to use the force pod.

1870
02:23:31,637 --> 02:23:32,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1871
02:23:42,856 --> 02:23:45,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot my Street Fighter 4 stick.

1872
02:23:45,158 --> 02:23:49,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played a single 360 shmup without it besides Omega 5.

1873
02:23:50,541 --> 02:23:55,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting how that Street Fighter 4 stick is really adaptable to lots of different games, isn't it?

1874
02:23:57,846 --> 02:23:58,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1875
02:23:59,908 --> 02:24:05,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm planning on eventually modifying it to have a different kind of stick.

1876
02:24:05,111 --> 02:24:07,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard those are better for shmups and other types of games.

1877
02:24:13,524 --> 02:24:19,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish they'd release a better D-pad so we don't have to spend all this money on these fancy schmancy joysticks.

1878
02:24:19,247 --> 02:24:21,989
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, you know, whatever helps bring the experience in.

1879
02:24:22,009 --> 02:24:24,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with the D-pad, I would have done this thing anyway.

1880
02:24:26,231 --> 02:24:31,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well Ray, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you as always for the call and a variety of topics tonight.

1881
02:24:31,214 --> 02:24:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope you get all the shrubs you want in 2010, okay?

1882
02:24:35,270 --> 02:24:35,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

1883
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, later.

1884
02:24:37,671 --> 02:24:38,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1885
02:24:38,551 --> 02:24:38,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1886
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:41,571
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Loki, I rudely cut you off earlier.

1887
02:24:41,591 --> 02:24:43,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, but of course our listeners come first.

1888
02:24:43,492 --> 02:24:43,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1889
02:24:44,332 --> 02:24:44,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alright.

1890
02:24:45,252 --> 02:24:49,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Sirius Sam HD is coming to Xbox Live this week.

1891
02:24:51,774 --> 02:24:52,814
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the other thing I was going to say.

1892
02:24:53,034 --> 02:24:54,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we got another call just in time.

1893
02:24:54,835 --> 02:24:55,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1894
02:24:55,795 --> 02:24:56,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1895
02:24:58,075 --> 02:24:59,096
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Spazinator.

1896
02:24:59,296 --> 02:24:59,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Spazinator.

1897
02:24:59,896 --> 02:25:00,776
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1898
02:25:02,673 --> 02:25:03,914
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of quick things.

1899
02:25:03,954 --> 02:25:05,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1900
02:25:05,555 --> 02:25:18,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since you just got your 360 back, there was one game that I seriously recommend that you at least give it a try.

1901
02:25:18,121 --> 02:25:23,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out after your original 360 broke.

1902
02:25:25,705 --> 02:25:27,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It said Magic the Gathering 3.

1903
02:25:28,622 --> 02:25:30,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Duel of the Paint Walkers

1904
02:25:33,035 --> 02:25:34,296
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1905
02:26:01,967 --> 02:26:04,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Spazinator, were you a card game player?

1906
02:26:04,410 --> 02:26:07,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play Magic as a card game or was this your first exposure to it?

1907
02:26:09,354 --> 02:26:12,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I played it in high school just like you.

1908
02:26:14,078 --> 02:26:26,430
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I was a sophomore when I started playing it and an older classmate of mine introduced me to the card game and I got hooked right away.

1909
02:26:27,376 --> 02:26:39,301
[SPEAKER_07]: and I've been playing it all through high school up until I graduated and then once I hit college and no one around me played Magic the Galer and I kind of gave it up.

1910
02:26:41,521 --> 02:26:45,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to play season one Magic the Galer game.

1911
02:26:46,543 --> 02:26:52,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It was loosely based on Magic but it wasn't totally faithful to the card game.

1912
02:26:53,266 --> 02:26:53,466
[SPEAKER_07]: But

1913
02:26:54,301 --> 02:26:59,362
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dextox Live game is, by comparison, damn good.

1914
02:26:59,822 --> 02:27:06,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had an old, old version on the PC that was released probably around the same time I actually played the game.

1915
02:27:06,123 --> 02:27:08,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe by the time I was like a senior in high school or so forth.

1916
02:27:08,564 --> 02:27:11,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been like 95, 96 that this was actually released.

1917
02:27:12,245 --> 02:27:15,165
[SPEAKER_03]: They had like an old PC one that was pretty darn good.

1918
02:27:15,705 --> 02:27:16,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It had its flaws.

1919
02:27:16,946 --> 02:27:18,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't quite as, like it really...

1920
02:27:19,366 --> 02:27:19,826
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1921
02:27:47,936 --> 02:27:51,737
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the thing you like most about the Magic game?

1922
02:27:51,797 --> 02:27:53,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for somebody who maybe hasn't played the card game.

1923
02:27:54,258 --> 02:27:56,398
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think makes the game cool?

1924
02:27:58,459 --> 02:28:12,303
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to literally put into words, but it's like a combination of dumb luck, getting a lot of the cards that you need when you need them,

1925
02:28:13,454 --> 02:28:21,802
[SPEAKER_07]: and then actually a little bit of know-how and strategy.

1926
02:28:21,822 --> 02:28:36,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of any good analogies off the top of my head, but what I just said before probably fits the best that I can come up with.

1927
02:28:39,895 --> 02:28:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, let me just interject this real quick.

1928
02:28:42,918 --> 02:28:46,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, because X-Link posted this in our chat room, and this is exactly what I was looking for.

1929
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:48,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Magic the Gathering.

1930
02:28:49,282 --> 02:28:50,263
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what always confused me.

1931
02:28:50,303 --> 02:28:52,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also called Duels of the Planewalkers.

1932
02:28:52,724 --> 02:28:57,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It was released by Microprose in 1997, so a little later than I thought it was.

1933
02:28:58,028 --> 02:29:05,353
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I remember that you would get a big oversized card that came in the box that I thought was kind of funny with the game.

1934
02:29:05,393 --> 02:29:06,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so anyway...

1935
02:29:06,334 --> 02:29:12,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally used to use the Candelabra to bring it into my regular deck.

1936
02:29:12,415 --> 02:29:18,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had an Astral set where a set of cards that were specifically in the game.

1937
02:29:18,577 --> 02:29:20,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So this whole little thing.

1938
02:29:21,678 --> 02:29:24,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it was a whole little game that came out many years ago.

1939
02:29:24,438 --> 02:29:25,479
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still good.

1940
02:29:25,919 --> 02:29:27,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It was much different.

1941
02:29:27,999 --> 02:29:31,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, that totally reminded me of my other big thing of geekery.

1942
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:32,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, please.

1943
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:34,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I was using that same card to bring Captain Picard into my deck.

1944
02:29:36,201 --> 02:29:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do that?

1945
02:29:37,201 --> 02:29:46,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like two combinations of cards where you can bring any card, any, it was worded, any outside card and put it in your graveyard and then another one to recycle your graveyard into your deck.

1946
02:29:47,565 --> 02:29:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That is crazy.

1947
02:29:48,486 --> 02:29:50,426
[SPEAKER_01]: So, bring out Captain Picard.

1948
02:29:51,307 --> 02:29:53,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would the random card do?

1949
02:29:53,227 --> 02:29:54,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it get stats of any sort?

1950
02:29:54,408 --> 02:29:58,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't have to cast anything because I didn't have anything to cast other than just lay him down.

1951
02:29:58,949 --> 02:30:01,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I always would say he'd rally my troops.

1952
02:30:02,271 --> 02:30:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1953
02:30:03,576 --> 02:30:05,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry for the bit of randomness, Spazinator.

1954
02:30:06,338 --> 02:30:07,898
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is on your mind besides magic?

1955
02:30:09,579 --> 02:30:10,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Two more quick hits.

1956
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:12,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1957
02:30:12,741 --> 02:30:17,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that you specifically aren't really too sports at all.

1958
02:30:18,464 --> 02:30:32,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about DarkSakura or Loki or even any of the other listeners, but I happen to notice that over on the PlayStation Network store, specifically the video site,

1959
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:49,487
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually got some sports programming on there, like old NHL games, NBA games, NCAA football games, a little bit of everything over there.

1960
02:30:50,808 --> 02:30:58,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't speak into whether or not they got the same thing over on the Xbox Live Marketplace or not.

1961
02:30:58,775 --> 02:31:02,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while since I checked the video content over there, but...

1962
02:31:03,490 --> 02:31:10,094
[SPEAKER_07]: If you happen to like watching sports and there's nothing good on regular TV, there's always that.

1963
02:31:10,814 --> 02:31:19,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I just happened to recently buy an old hockey game and the Fiesta Bowl from 2009 just validated they were pretty good.

1964
02:31:25,802 --> 02:31:30,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and X-Link in chat kind of chimes in that the sports is just for the PSN.

1965
02:31:30,188 --> 02:31:37,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to be honest, I don't surf the video marketplace very often because I have Netflix, and usually that kind of fills in my video needs.

1966
02:31:37,677 --> 02:31:40,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting that...

1967
02:31:42,874 --> 02:32:09,075
[SPEAKER_03]: that that exists because you know if you saw like a really awesome play in a game or what have you I mean that's literally content on demand you know but I don't know I don't know how um it doesn't seem like that would be very popular to watch a game and download it like long after it's been played when you read about it on you know your favorite sports or see it on ESPN the next day but hey I guess if there's that one awesome play or something really epic happens in the game you can download it and watch it forever even though it would be on YouTube too

1968
02:32:10,649 --> 02:32:11,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, true.

1969
02:32:11,489 --> 02:32:17,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, granted, I'm not exactly the biggest sports fan out there.

1970
02:32:18,031 --> 02:32:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm far from it, which is kind of weird because I'm from a sports-crazy city.

1971
02:32:23,853 --> 02:32:25,913
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it wasn't a great while.

1972
02:32:25,953 --> 02:32:28,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do like to watch a game of some sort.

1973
02:32:29,094 --> 02:32:31,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And I figured, kind of like, what the hell?

1974
02:32:31,915 --> 02:32:33,235
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll get that.

1975
02:32:33,255 --> 02:32:34,976
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing on record TV.

1976
02:32:35,616 --> 02:32:39,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of like, you know, impulse buy, so...

1977
02:32:39,778 --> 02:32:47,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, if there's a buck to be made off of the game, and if they even make $50 off the encoding and what have you, they'll probably do it.

1978
02:32:48,025 --> 02:32:49,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Quickly, what was your other thing?

1979
02:32:49,026 --> 02:32:51,288
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you had one other thing, and then we've got to let you go to get more calls.

1980
02:32:52,709 --> 02:32:56,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he has a relatively minor bone to pick.

1981
02:32:56,793 --> 02:33:01,477
[SPEAKER_07]: He was your number one pick for Listless.

1982
02:33:01,977 --> 02:33:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why is that?

1983
02:33:03,839 --> 02:33:03,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1984
02:33:04,645 --> 02:33:15,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, you know, Bobby kind of said what I was thinking, is that, you know, X-Play isn't nearly as bad as it may get up to.

1985
02:33:15,931 --> 02:33:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, being a screener is not the greatest show there ever is or was, but, you know, it's not quite as bad as you may think.

1986
02:33:25,576 --> 02:33:33,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, in fact, that's one of several sources I get my gaming news from, so...

1987
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:41,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it as you will, but, you know, it isn't all bad, though.

1988
02:33:42,471 --> 02:33:49,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be digging up old, old stuff here, but let's not forget this is the show that thought Beatmania was newer than Guitar Hero.

1989
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:55,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the quality of the show needs a little work.

1990
02:33:55,203 --> 02:34:00,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I'm picking on them because I can, but I don't know.

1991
02:34:00,488 --> 02:34:05,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the quality of gaming television overall could be a little better if somebody would just try.

1992
02:34:07,334 --> 02:34:07,574
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1993
02:34:09,033 --> 02:34:10,274
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fair enough.

1994
02:34:10,574 --> 02:34:16,456
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Spaznator, we've got to let you go, but take care and have a good one, okay?

1995
02:34:16,476 --> 02:34:16,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, you too.

1996
02:34:16,896 --> 02:34:17,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1997
02:34:36,038 --> 02:34:36,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.

1998
02:34:37,119 --> 02:34:38,439
[SPEAKER_03]: This argument is years old.

1999
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:39,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.

2000
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:39,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't coming back.

2001
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:40,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Things ain't the way they used to be.

2002
02:34:40,961 --> 02:34:42,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just what we're going to have to deal with.

2003
02:34:42,401 --> 02:34:44,503
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2004
02:34:44,583 --> 02:34:46,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2005
02:34:46,243 --> 02:34:50,406
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, we'll try to get at least one more call in before we close up shop tonight.

2006
02:34:50,906 --> 02:34:52,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other last minute stories, Loki?

2007
02:34:56,069 --> 02:34:56,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

2008
02:34:58,527 --> 02:35:06,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's new Dragon Age Origins download content coming out on January 5th on PC and Xbox 360.

2009
02:35:06,228 --> 02:35:09,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out later in January on PlayStation 3.

2010
02:35:10,289 --> 02:35:12,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a return of Ostagar.

2011
02:35:12,489 --> 02:35:13,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get to the phones.

2012
02:35:13,490 --> 02:35:14,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2013
02:35:14,370 --> 02:35:14,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2014
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:17,630
[SPEAKER_05]: This is DSMaster26.

2015
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:19,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, DSMaster, what's on your mind?

2016
02:35:20,711 --> 02:35:24,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been pretty pumped about getting the 360s.

2017
02:35:27,176 --> 02:35:29,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the best game system I've ever owned since the PS2, frankly enough.

2018
02:35:29,278 --> 02:35:29,398
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

2019
02:35:29,418 --> 02:35:30,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy about getting a 360.

2020
02:35:30,058 --> 02:35:30,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the email I read, Rob.

2021
02:35:30,759 --> 02:35:34,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And no offense, but I was having a really hard time reading your email because you don't really use punctuation.

2022
02:35:54,714 --> 02:35:55,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

2023
02:35:56,075 --> 02:35:57,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of writing it on the quick.

2024
02:35:58,176 --> 02:36:05,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that Facebook group that's called There's a Big Difference Between Let's Eat, Grandma, and Let's Eat Grandma?

2025
02:36:06,542 --> 02:36:10,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to join that, because I'm actually a member of like four different grammar forums.

2026
02:36:10,845 --> 02:36:11,565
[SPEAKER_01]: You should look that one up.

2027
02:36:11,585 --> 02:36:13,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the book, the calendar I bought?

2028
02:36:13,807 --> 02:36:14,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat, Shoots, I get it.

2029
02:36:14,868 --> 02:36:15,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat, Shoots, and Leaves, I get it.

2030
02:36:15,808 --> 02:36:19,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not seen that, but...

2031
02:36:20,859 --> 02:36:36,148
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, I've been playing a whole lot of Halo 3 before Reach comes out and I'm probably going to pick up Halo 1 and 2 and 3 ODFT possibly when that comes out and try to gain up on the Halo story in a sense.

2032
02:36:37,429 --> 02:36:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there still lots of people playing Halo 3 online?

2033
02:36:39,930 --> 02:36:44,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it still as crazy popular as Halo 2 is still being played online like 5 years after it was out?

2034
02:36:46,374 --> 02:36:49,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and there's still people playing Halo 2 if you can believe it.

2035
02:36:51,067 --> 02:36:53,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, apparently I read an article on Kotaku...

2036
02:37:06,278 --> 02:37:11,420
[SPEAKER_05]: that said it's because of Halo 2 that we have the friend cap of 100 for the 360.

2037
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:13,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2038
02:37:14,180 --> 02:37:15,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard this come up.

2039
02:37:15,481 --> 02:37:17,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Bobby's discussed this on his show before.

2040
02:37:17,381 --> 02:37:24,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've heard him talk about it where the whole friend cap of 100, Halo 2 is to blame because people are still playing that.

2041
02:37:24,223 --> 02:37:30,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order for them to break the 100 cap, they would essentially have to disable Halo 2, which I don't think anyone wants to happen anytime soon.

2042
02:37:30,965 --> 02:37:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask you this, DS Master, because you're a big Halo fan.

2043
02:37:34,966 --> 02:37:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think a Halo Reach is on its way this year?

2044
02:37:37,908 --> 02:37:38,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited for that?

2045
02:37:39,650 --> 02:37:46,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm not really a Halo fan, but I'm like, I wanted a really good first-person shooter on a console.

2046
02:37:47,015 --> 02:37:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And after playing at my Troops Holiday Party for Boy Scouts, which we do every year, like, it was so much fun.

2047
02:37:54,260 --> 02:37:58,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, holy crap, I'm finally getting the hang of this.

2048
02:37:58,804 --> 02:38:04,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing a console FPS after playing Quake Live for nearly a year or two.

2049
02:38:06,361 --> 02:38:14,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've told this story on the show before, but the very first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception, and that's where I actually had a whole lot of fun, was shooting up the wedding party.

2050
02:38:14,868 --> 02:38:17,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I shit you not, that's the first time I ever played Halo.

2051
02:38:18,031 --> 02:38:18,451
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

2052
02:38:18,491 --> 02:38:24,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, our longest session was probably two hours, 49 minutes, and 19 seconds.

2053
02:38:24,636 --> 02:38:25,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Good lord.

2054
02:38:27,018 --> 02:38:32,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Then quickly, if you are into first-person shooters, what do you think about the idea of turning them all into dating sims?

2055
02:38:34,588 --> 02:38:35,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

2056
02:38:35,509 --> 02:38:41,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's enough of a dating sim with the girl gamers trying to hit up on the gamer guys on Xbox Live.

2057
02:38:42,598 --> 02:38:42,918
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.

2058
02:38:43,018 --> 02:38:43,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is true.

2059
02:38:43,739 --> 02:38:45,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry if I'm shivering and whatnot.

2060
02:38:54,742 --> 02:38:55,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cold in Nebraska.

2061
02:38:55,923 --> 02:38:56,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

2062
02:38:57,184 --> 02:39:00,246
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get shot with a hug gun, I think is what needs to happen.

2063
02:39:00,507 --> 02:39:02,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to log into Halo and somebody needs to shoot you with a hug gun.

2064
02:39:03,929 --> 02:39:04,209
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2065
02:39:04,770 --> 02:39:09,453
[SPEAKER_03]: DS Master, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call and your email and so forth.

2066
02:39:09,493 --> 02:39:10,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You take care, okay?

2067
02:39:11,235 --> 02:39:11,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace out.

2068
02:39:11,755 --> 02:39:12,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep the good shows rocking.

2069
02:39:13,296 --> 02:39:13,757
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try.

2070
02:39:13,777 --> 02:39:14,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

2071
02:39:17,393 --> 02:39:19,815
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2072
02:39:19,855 --> 02:39:20,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry those didn't get through.

2073
02:39:20,815 --> 02:39:22,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember, you can send us an email.

2074
02:39:22,096 --> 02:39:22,516
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

2075
02:39:22,677 --> 02:39:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was only one in the email bag tonight.

2076
02:39:25,098 --> 02:39:26,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the person got through on the phone anyway.

2077
02:39:26,519 --> 02:39:27,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can't control it.

2078
02:39:27,860 --> 02:39:28,921
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a call screener.

2079
02:39:30,341 --> 02:39:31,162
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't afford one.

2080
02:39:31,982 --> 02:39:32,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the future.

2081
02:39:32,763 --> 02:39:33,063
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

2082
02:39:33,784 --> 02:39:36,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to start to close up shop here.

2083
02:39:36,545 --> 02:39:38,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Because believe it or not, we've been on air for about three hours.

2084
02:39:39,627 --> 02:39:42,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it might not feel like that on the podcast because we do a little break in the middle of live.

2085
02:39:42,749 --> 02:39:44,571
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still going to be a long show tonight.

2086
02:39:45,171 --> 02:39:45,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And a good show.

2087
02:39:45,771 --> 02:39:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Good first show of the year.

2088
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the best book.

2089
02:39:48,370 --> 02:39:49,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with games.

2090
02:39:49,150 --> 02:39:50,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, books are important too.

2091
02:39:50,190 --> 02:39:52,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the best book that's called Why Is Daddy in a Dress?

2092
02:39:52,311 --> 02:39:53,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Answering Awkward Questions with Baby Animals.

2093
02:39:53,371 --> 02:39:53,871
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best.

2094
02:39:53,911 --> 02:39:54,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, Rob.

2095
02:40:16,141 --> 02:40:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is daddy in a dress?

2096
02:40:18,402 --> 02:40:18,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2097
02:40:19,083 --> 02:40:20,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's one of the pages.

2098
02:40:21,564 --> 02:40:23,205
[SPEAKER_03]: How much for a happy ending?

2099
02:40:23,225 --> 02:40:23,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2100
02:40:23,445 --> 02:40:24,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a kitten.

2101
02:40:24,125 --> 02:40:25,886
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to hate that when you were doing massage classes.

2102
02:40:25,906 --> 02:40:30,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why I was laughing because it just made me go, wow.

2103
02:40:30,088 --> 02:40:31,889
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cute with little kittens.

2104
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:40,434
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one with a little puppy that said, why does daddy look like the pool boy?

2105
02:40:40,454 --> 02:40:40,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2106
02:40:43,104 --> 02:40:47,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta read this comment from Marissa, and I hope she doesn't mind me reading a private message publicly here on the show.

2107
02:40:47,990 --> 02:40:48,851
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I told her to send it to you.

2108
02:40:49,011 --> 02:40:49,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

2109
02:40:50,372 --> 02:40:53,536
[SPEAKER_03]: She said that they were just having a discussion at her house about punctuation.

2110
02:40:53,816 --> 02:40:59,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Capitalization is important too, because like, for instance, you might have, you know, capitalization could change this sentence.

2111
02:41:00,443 --> 02:41:01,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Help your uncle jack off the horse.

2112
02:41:02,305 --> 02:41:07,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Help your uncle jack off the horse as in you need samples for mating purposes or whatever.

2113
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:25,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Capitalization and punctuation are important.

2114
02:41:28,816 --> 02:41:30,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I love those little kitten postcards.

2115
02:41:30,257 --> 02:41:31,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are adorable.

2116

2120

[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2121
02:41:47,732 --> 02:41:49,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I'll play Borderlands this week.

2122
02:41:52,442 --> 02:42:16,208
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is hopefully I'll get to play one of the like 50 games that I have in my queue of games to play this week get to spend more time with that but I'll probably be too busy trying to finish Symphony of the Night and making progress in Gyromancer and Shadow Complex and eventually playing Morrowind too many things to do DarkSakura, your final thought tonight yeah
