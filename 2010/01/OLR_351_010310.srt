Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto the King

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, January 3rd, 2010

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What could Google be planning for gaming?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A brand new 8-bit NES game is about to be released

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And what in the world is a Wiiwa?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are that show dedicated to video games

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And with me as always, say hello to the one and only

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Always ready and alert as always, right?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Uh huh

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, exactly

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How you doing, Loki?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Doing fine

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see you YouTubing something over there

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's going on?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm just looking at an auction for a bar top cavity

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because it's hilarious how much they try to charge

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For these things

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Like, they want $900 for this

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can get two full-size arcade games for that

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
These people are dumb

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You know, one story that was given to us this week

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That didn't make our show roll tonight though

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Because I remember bringing this up on a previous show

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But the big Metreon in San Francisco

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They're selling all their cabinets

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I know that story made gaming blogs this week

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I think I mentioned that on the show a couple weeks ago

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When I was, or maybe about a month ago

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When I was there at the Metreon

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They're selling a bunch of cabinets

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, they also want too much for their DDR machine too

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I remember that they're beating me in a three

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They only wanted a few hundred dollars for

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Or maybe it was, I don't remember

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Maybe it was a thousand or something

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But I was seriously considering it

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If I wasn't a stinking adult with stinking adult responsibilities

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I would have seriously considered it

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But alas

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Another piece of my car broke this week

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And it made me realize, you know

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Probably before I indulge in the video game habit

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I probably ought to get a car

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Probably should

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Stupid responsibility

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh well

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, Rob, you are almost 75% to a new present

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Anyhow, let's uh

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, that's right, because you're working on an MP3

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, I've since discovered that

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The real player converter will convert to MP3

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Off stuff off YouTube

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's a lot of websites that do that too

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've seen that happen

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is so much easier because it just runs in the background

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And it works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So enjoy your gift of Angela Aki covers

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sweet

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Anyhow

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And the types of stuff we've been playing

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I know maybe because of the holidays

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Not everyone's really been gaming

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But we'll go around and check in with everybody

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Peggle-rific

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm playing through challenge mode on Peggle right now

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I've beaten three of the five point stages

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's freaking hard

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
On the iPhone

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then we had a bunch of

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Raiden 4 going on in the house last night

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then they were all

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, let's watch Macross

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So they were watching Macross

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Macross Frontier

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I actually dropped by randomly yesterday

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because I wanted to show a friend the OLR studio

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And we had Sonic

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, you guys were watching Macross

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I was kind of like, oh, anime

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That I'm not familiar with

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because I don't follow anime as closely as I think a lot of our listeners do

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't follow it nearly as much as I used to

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But we have plenty of friends that do

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And Dan's like, oh, bring it over, let's see what's new

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good times

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They had Hetalia, which I love

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's the one where it's different personifications of countries

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So all the different countries are characters

102
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And America is trying to solve everything through cheeseburgers

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And Japan is very soft-spoken

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And never gives a clear answer

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Dan's still playing the hell out of Borderlands, out of curiosity?

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, pretty much

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But he's actually played through

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Ikaruga the other night

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was going to say, when I came over the other night

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They were playing some Japanese shooter game on 360

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I wasn't sure if it was Triggerheart, Excellica

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I only glanced at it for a second

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was Ikaruga? Okay

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because they were actually watching playthroughs

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Of other people doing tricks

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So they decided they were going to do them themselves

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think they watched some guy do a perfect playthrough of Ikaruga

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And decided that they wanted to do it

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Alright

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week? What did you do?

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I too played Ikaruga on my arcade cabinet

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because I was working on getting Naomi's stuff

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Random, okay

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I was working on getting my Naomi and a Thomas Wave

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And actually also my Zinc emulation running

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Zinc though doesn't seem to run very well

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The loader that I have for it sucks

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I have to do it by hand

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But I tried playing Urguts

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And that's pretty fun

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Except I wish the Japanese ROM would work

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because I think the US one doesn't have Cloud in it

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes it does

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It does?

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ask with Cloud and Tifa because I've played one

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do I have to unlock it or something?

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I do not remember because it's been a long time since I've played it

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But I thought it was either that or time released

140
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Or that it's like some little trick you have to do

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But yeah, I've played both of them in the American cabinet

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well then I will have to mess around with that

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But in the meantime I couldn't get any of the controls to work

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Even though I configured them correctly

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's just being retarded

146
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I did play a little bit of Thomas Wave

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Had a little bit of Dolphin Blue

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Which for those who aren't familiar

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is another game that's very similar to Metal Slug

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Done by the creators of Metal Slug

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And when you play the game you're like

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh wow, this is almost like Metal Slug

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Except they're riding dolphins

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So that was kind of fun

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then I tried to get Marvel vs. Capcom 2 working

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But I think it may be a little too much for my processor

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And the arcade cabinet

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because it's only 2.2 GHz

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Whereas you probably need a little bit more than that

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I actually have to overclock it since I can do that

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So maybe that'll fix it

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because right now the sound's a little laggy

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And it's kind of annoying

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then let's see what else did I play

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Other than Ikaruga

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, Guilty Gear Iizuka

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Which is interesting because I didn't realize

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That they had a four player Guilty Gear game

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So that was neat

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then other than arcade cabinet stuff

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I played through the rest of the Little Big Planet

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Pirates of the Caribbean level pack

173
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And it was alright

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It wasn't as cool as the Metal Gear Solid pack

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But it was pretty good

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Still worth the five or six bucks that you have to pay for it

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But still, how can you top guns?

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean, it's tough

179
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it's understandable

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then of course more Grand Theft Auto

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Still no Borderlands

182
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thought about it, but been working on the cabinet

183
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I haven't had a chance to play anything

184
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have Borderlands

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just haven't played it

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been sitting on it for weeks now

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Months now actually

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll eventually get around to it

189
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'd like to play it too

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So if you don't ever crack open that copy

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, it's cracked open

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's ready to go

193
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I just haven't gotten a chance to do it yet

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When are you bringing Bayonetta over for me?

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The damn thing's out this week, right?

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This week or next?

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Very soon

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hopefully, if your husband knows Jamie

199
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He'll be bringing it home

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's pretty awesome

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So yeah, definitely check that out this week

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, I think that's really

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I mean, last week we had some pretty epic

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Grand Theft Auto games

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Because of everybody being off

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Funny enough though, we actually were playing against people in the UK

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Because I guess it was probably evening over there in the UK when we were playing

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think they're about eight hours ahead of us

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay, so they are about evening

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was funny though

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because we had some people playing

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And we can hear them over the headsets

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And they're, I'm gonna get

214
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm gonna get the call in the green

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That little wanker

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No wanker

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So I'm gonna get the green fella

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I like getting cussed at in

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't want to say other languages

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But other dialects, I guess you could say

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You know, getting called a poof

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And you know, all those other types of words

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It was pretty brutal though

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I had 47 kills in 20 minutes

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
With a streak of 14

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And people were pissed

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So it was fun

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In fact, actually the second player

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Second place had half as many

230
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Actually less than half as many kills as I did

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it was fun

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So that's what I've been playing

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All that fun stuff

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Awesome

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm just imagining all the little talk

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
On Grand Theft Auto

237
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We don't talk back

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because it's hard to wear headphones and a headset

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
At the same time

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So we just listen to it

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And it's funny

242
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Has anyone invented that?

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like a third party?

244
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A headphone slash headset?

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They have

246
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My actual new 5.1 headset

247
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Which by the way

248
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I don't know why these headsets do this

249
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But one of the channels is already cutting out on it

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Because I guess the cord is so heavy

251
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That it's pulling it out a little bit

252
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm only getting that

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
One speaker

254
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Which is annoying

255
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I've had other headsets do the same thing

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But yeah, they have Turtle Beach headsets

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But they're like $100

258
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I think the cheapest one you can get that has that built in

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Is like

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know

261
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Maybe

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
$60

263
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But really what they need to come up with

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Excuse me

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is a clip-on microphone or something like that

266
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That you can just wear so you can talk

267
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because you don't really need the headset to hear people talking

268
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Most games have a way you can listen to it

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Through your actual headphones

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So

271
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's all you really need

272
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is just that

273
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because it's just really awkward the way it is

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Going to the chat room of course

275
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000

288
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SSJ100Matt says I thought Rob's British accent

289
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is banned from the show

290
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't remember that getting an official banning

291
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But fine it'll be my Welsh accent there

292
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Anyhow

293
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Going into

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not sing-songy enough

295
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll work on it

296
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If my Japanese pronunciation got better

297
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Maybe I should resolve this year to work on my British accent

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll have to Skype some of our British listeners

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And say please teach me how to say cute things

301
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And you know I'll teach you

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Teach me how to speak English English

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes please teach me how to speak English

304
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't even do that on the show

305
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you've listened to the past two or three months of show

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know if it's because I have to multitask a lot

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
While doing the show or what

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But sometimes the things that come out of my mouth

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm like what did I say

310
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just totally butchered the English language

311
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I need English lessons from an English person

312
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's what I need

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Anyhow

314
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know they do have those

315
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I want to say that it's

316
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They actually have like British English

317
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
As you know a language learning system

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like is that something I can get the Rosetta Stone for

319
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm serious I think they do have that

321
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I actually probably have that

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Since I downloaded all of them at some point

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Call it a hunch

324
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I think that was made for people

325
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That don't have English as a first language

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That maybe want to move to London

327
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Or those places you know

328
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But then you pick it up quick

329
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I stopped being a wanker

330
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can speak like them

331
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Stop being a wanker

332
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Alright let's see

333
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My gaming week

334
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Actually I played a crap ton of games

335
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I know I usually get on here and like

336
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I played WoW

337
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I did play WoW

338
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I finally hit level 80 on my paladin

339
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you very much

340
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Da da da da

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I did that

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Stop sighing over there DarkSakura

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That was a yawn

344
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sorry

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well I didn't just play WoW

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I actually played a lot of games

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Because here you go

348
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Wake up for this DarkSakura

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is very important

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I have a 360 again

351
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That sounds like a personal problem

352
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Shut up

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now after the whole like what

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Four or five months

355
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I haven't had one

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It was like August 11th or something

357
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That update came out

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That borked my 360

359
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I finally have a new 360

360
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I spent a lot of time

361
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Just catching up on stuff

362
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I just filled up my queue

363
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
With like Kix

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And Bubble Bobble Neo

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And Rainbow Islands

366
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
None of these games

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I played really in depth

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In fact oddly enough

369
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The game I probably played more than anything

370
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I went back

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I just had this itching to play

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It probably has something to do with the fact

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That that's like one of the best games ever made

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That I wanted to go back and play it

376
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And that I never really played it through to completion on 360

377
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I've been sinking a lot of time into that

378
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Also though

379
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Speaking of Castlevania and that whole

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You know Metroid

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And the exploration game

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
One game that just kind of wasn't on my radar last year

383
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Was Shadow Complex

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I finally took the opportunity to play

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I finally took the opportunity to download Shadow Complex

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
To my 360 and check it out

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And wow

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Did I miss that

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like seriously

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That game was kind of awesome

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And by kind of I mean really

392
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It is like a Super Metroid

393
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Castlevania type exploration game

394
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But a little more modernized you know

395
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And part

396
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I gotta be honest

397
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Part of what kept me away from looking at that game before

398
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is when I was looking at the screenshots and everything

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was like

400
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Looks like a clancy

401
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Espionage kind of game

402
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I'm not usually into those games

403
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't want to play a gun scope killing game

404
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't really like those kind of games

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I will admit

406
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That was ignorant of me

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Very ignorant

408
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But I finally got over it

409
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And downloaded the game

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I had an awesome time with it

411
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I am really wanting to play that game through to completion

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I highly recommend it

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was fun

414
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I was impressed by how much they crammed into

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
An arcade download

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because seriously

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
They could charge 30 bucks for this stuff on Blu-ray

418
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Or I'm sorry

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's 360

420
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They could charge this on a DVD

421
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And put it in stores

422
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And most folks would be none the wiser

423
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So

424
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah

425
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was very excited to play Shadow Complex

426
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll spend a little bit of time with Gyromancer

427
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Which I played on the PC a little bit ago

428
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But one of my friends sat me down

429
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And kind of explained the game a little better

430
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because I gotta admit the tutorial

431
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The game kind of is very wordy

432
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Didn't make a whole lot of sense

433
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But having it explained to me really helped

434
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Once I'm able to get over that hurdle

435
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Of thinking about the board

436
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like it's regular Bejeweled

437
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And thinking of it like Bejeweled Twist

438
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The game is very interesting

439
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I actually think it's a little more accessible

440
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Than Puzzle Quest

441
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Which was just

442
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Battle after battle

443
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
After micromanaging

444
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
After micromanaging

445
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Gyromancer does feel a little more straightforward

446
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Like there is a start any finish

447
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And yes you have these maps

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You can go back and play them

449
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But there just seems to be

450
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't know

451
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I feel more accomplished playing Gyromancer

452
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Like I feel like I got nowhere in Puzzle Quest

453
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Because I didn't spend a hundred hours with it

454
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But yeah

455
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm looking forward to spending more time with Gyromancer

456
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And you know one thing that a lot of folks asked

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
When I got the 360

458
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because I had to do that mandatory tweet

459
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
From Twitter on the 360

460
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where I said

461
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hi I'm tweeting for my 360

462
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Because I think everybody did that tweet

463
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
When it first came out

464
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Didn't

465
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well those that used Twitter anyway

466
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's what you do

467
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Did you even bother to look at it on the 360?

468
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No

469
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well that's why

470
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because I didn't care

471
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I have it on my computer

472
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I got to be honest

473
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's really nothing

474
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like it's a frivolous silly thing on the 360

475
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And probably is something most people look at only once

476
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I got to say I did play with Facebook a little bit too

477
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And I think Facebook looks hideous on the 360

478
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I hate the way it's laid out

479
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because they try to put Facebook in the Xbox crossbar format

480
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Which the more and more I use it

481
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The more and more I really don't like the NXC

482
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I just I love all the features

483
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I hate the layout

484
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Like what they had before

485
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I honestly think was better

486
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But whatever

487
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The cool thing about Facebook is that

488
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You can find friends on Facebook

489
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That are on 360

490
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And you can find friends on 360

491
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That are on Facebook

492
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Like the gamer tags and names are linked

493
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So like maybe I have people on my Xbox list

494
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That I didn't have added on Facebook

495
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Or like for example

496
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Somehow I didn't have Tiara on my Xbox 360 list

497
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I found because she's on my Facebook

498
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That she had a gamer tag

499
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I sent her a friend request

500
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So Tiara if you're listening

501
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Accept my friend request

502
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're making me cry

503
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And of course I had to play a little bit of last FM2

504
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I had to catch up on all this crap I missed

505
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I realized this is like months old

506
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That it was all new to me

507
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But anyway the Twitter response I got to my tweet

508
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
About hi for my 360 I have one again was

509
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh well guess your Playstation 3 is going to be collecting dust now huh?

510
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No I think

511
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Honestly this little bit of downtime

512
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Has really raised my respect for Sony

513
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because I know we've given them a lot of crap on the show

514
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And rightfully so

515
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't get me wrong

516
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I haven't suddenly said

517
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Sony has forgiven for everything they've done wrong

518
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think they made lots and lots of great improvements in 09

519
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And you know there's things I look forward to from them in 2010

520
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And in fact there's going to be some cases

521
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Where it's 360 versus Playstation 3

522
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm going the route of Playstation 3

523
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
For example Final Fantasy 13

524
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I plan to buy that on Playstation 3

525
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Better controller

526
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think the game was designed for that in the first place

527
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's just where I'm going

528
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Microsoft fans put down the hate mail

529
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because there's some things I'm going to opt for on 360 as well

530
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
For instance a lot of the things that have online play

531
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I just know more people on 360

532
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's probably where I'll go with those games

533
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Plus I'm still playing a lot of DJ Hero

534
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And that's on Playstation 3 for me

535
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So I have to throw that out there too

536
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I finally got the trophy for playing every song in the game at least once

537
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Even the songs I didn't want to play

538
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I finally played everything at least once

539
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So making good progress there

540
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's see I'm going to our chatroom again

541
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

542
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Some people wondering what NXC was

543
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Because I just rattled that off

544
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah that's the new Xbox experience

545
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's the new interface they launched

546
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When was that? Was that last holiday?

547
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That was about September of 2008

548
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think so

549
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When they switched from what was called the Blades to this new system

550
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That I can't stand

551
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I cannot stand the new 360 layout

552
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I love it

553
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sony fans, I'll give you that

554
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think Playstation 3 makes a hell of a lot more sense

555
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Than 360 does to navigate around

556
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I actually think it's really simple how they have it set up

557
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There's so much useless garbage in there

558
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you know how long it took me to figure out how to change my theme?

559
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like something that shouldn't be that hard

560
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh I have to go into Myself

561
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And then it's there

562
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh it's not in the guide button

563
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's not in these other settings page

564
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh I have to do this and this

565
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I thought that made perfect sense for it to be there

566
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean if it's my theme it would be my preference

567
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But there's nowhere on that box to say my preferences

568
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In fact if you hit the guide button and go into preferences

569
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You get a bunch of console preferences

570
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That have nothing to do with theme

571
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But like parental guides and user ratings and things I thought I disabled

572
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's not where I thought to go

573
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I like it better

574
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I like how it's laid out better

575
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think that it makes a lot more sense the way it's laid out

576
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The only thing that I don't like is just the ads

577
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I guess for the stuff that I don't care about

578
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But really the stuff that I want to get to quickly

579
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can get to very quickly

580
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And to be fair Sony has the ads too

581
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So if I'm going to hate it on 360 I have to hate it on Sony

582
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But I don't know the crossbar just works better for me

583
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Than NXT has been working

584
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But to Microsoft's credit

585
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They tend to upgrade their crap pretty fast

586
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And maybe some of these things that I'm QQing about

587
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
They will fix on the next update

588
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Even though I think they're only doing them yearly now

589
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm not sure

590
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Anyhow

591
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week

592
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I know I talked about a lot of games

593
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And really I didn't even talk about everything I played

594
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because I went on a shopping spree on Steam

595
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because they've been having their massive holiday sale

596
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know if you guys have looked at this

597
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Dude I got Morrowind for five bucks yesterday

598
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Just because it was five bucks

599
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I liked Oblivion yet I never played Morrowind

600
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I was like I'm going to drop five bucks on it

601
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I got Luminous last week

602
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I think there was another game I bought too

603
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's the problem with this stinkin' Steam sale

604
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Is that yeah the games are only five bucks

605
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But suddenly I bought four of them

606
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I dropped twenty

607
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You've just been friended Rob

608
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yay! Did you get a message from Tiara?

609
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
She's listening

610
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Thank you Tiara

611
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now I'm going to kick your ass in Puzzle Fighter

612
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm just kidding

613
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Alright we'll rock band or something

614
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Anyhow that's it for my gaming week

615
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So let's go to housekeeping

616
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Podcast listeners I know you thought we've neglected you

617
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I'm sorry and that's my bad

618
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That has nothing to do with Jamie or Matt

619
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's my responsibility and I've really slacked on it over the holidays

620
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But I cracked the whip today

621
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I got all four shows from December up

622
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And we are caught up

623
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And one of my

624
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Although I don't like to make New Year's resolutions

625
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
One of my goals let's say for 2010

626
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Is to do Monday turnarounds on the shows

627
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So that those are up on the feeds on Monday

628
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So keep me on my toes

629
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Twitters and Facebookers

630
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If I don't have the show up

631
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Tell me just quit playing WoW and get the damn show up

632
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It is by the way it is not as simple as

633
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Just clicking a button that says upload

634
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because we do edit the show

635
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We don't say edit, we don't edit content

636
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We don't really edit anything out unless there's

637
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like a huge technical failure that causes the show

638
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
To go down for ten minutes or something

639
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But we have to clean up the actual MP3s themselves

640
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Take out the little, you know

641
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You're listening to all games radio and all that

642
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And the little stuff that gets in the master file

643
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And all that technical jumbo

644
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And then we have to string it together to one file

645
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because we can't put the music break up

646
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And put that all up so

647
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It is a little more than just clicking a button that says upload

648
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Anyhow

649
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm not the technical jabber behind the show

650
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I do want to say one other bit of housekeeping

651
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I will not be here in two weeks

652
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I have a long weekend

653
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Martin Luther King is holiday for me

654
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So I actually am taking a long weekend

655
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
To go to Seattle

656
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's nothing going on out there

657
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm just going to say hey

658
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And be a tourist for a little while

659
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I will not be here though because I'm coming home on Monday

660
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So I believe

661
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
One of our long time listeners

662
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And listened so long we just made him

663
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
One that Suya is cooking up a best of

664
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That I'm hoping we'll be ready by that week

665
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So that's very exciting

666
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Also later in tonight's show

667
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Listless is coming back

668
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We haven't done Listless in forever

669
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We're doing one tonight

670
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And our old pal Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us

671
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is going to join us

672
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Because he always has us on his show

673
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But we never seem to get him on ours

674
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because we're on after him

675
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So there's no real tease at the end of the show

676
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Because we go off air at that point

677
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
To at least say thank you and let him participate

678
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
In our silly little game

679
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But before we get to the games we get to the news

680
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Loki

681
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes there's a rumor

682
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Kind of evolving the

683
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Development of the Playstation 4

684
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Which you know

685
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know it's coming eventually

686
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And obviously they're probably

687
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You know they started work on it

688
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The day after the Playstation 3 came out

689
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So one of the

690
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Possible pieces of technology

691
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That will be in the Playstation 4

692
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And possibly considered for

693
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You know additional

694
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Units afterwards

695
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Would be this thing called

696
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Project Larrabee

697
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And what it is

698
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's actually a

699
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
A piece of hardware

700
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Developed by Intel

701
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And it's kind of an architecture

702
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That revolves around

703
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
A lot of CPU's that's for sure

704
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You know the

705
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Kind of diagram that they have

706
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They have a bunch of different CPU cores

707
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Including this picture I think it's about

708
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
16 cores

709
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And each with their own

710
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Cache and kind of revolving

711
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Around this thing they call a ring bus

712
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Very cool looking

713
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And I guess it's

714
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Supposed to be

715
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Obviously very different than the cell

716
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Architecture that's available now

717
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I imagine since it's kind of being developed

718
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Around technology that's

719
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Around new multi-cell processors

720
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That something like this wouldn't be

721
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Too

722
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Too hard to develop or too hard to

723
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Manufacture

724
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And this is coming from

725
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
PC Watch's

726
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Hirosinji Goto

727
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Naming some

728
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Unnamed sources

729
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Familiar with Intel's long waited Larrabee project

730
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And also

731
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Apparently Intel was

732
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Pursuing relationships with Microsoft and Nintendo

733
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
As well for their next gen consoles

734
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So maybe this

735
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Technology might not be only in this

736
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You know Sony console

737
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And who knows if it's even going to be in the Sony console

738
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But

739
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't know it's kind of neat

740
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And something like this you know

741
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They could definitely scale it

742
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
To however many

743
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I guess processors they want in there

744
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Akdeft in chat says breaking news PS4 is coming eventually

745
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Which I think is what a lot of us

746
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That just kind of looked at the story went

747
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah okay so PS4 they're already planning some of the stuff for it

748
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Sure it's going to happen sometime

749
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What would this really mean for the system

750
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean is this just a boost in power

751
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Is this

752
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know is this

753
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Vaporware like the emotion engine chip

754
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Or I mean what is this

755
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well multi-processors like that I mean obviously

756
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's going to be the crunch everything from graphics

757
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
To physics

758
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
To game logic

759
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Whatever I mean so with this obviously

760
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You're going to be able to push

761
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Better graphics you know

762
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Better physics in the games

763
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You know more detailed

764
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Gameplay

765
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You know better sound

766
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You know a whole lot more detail in there

767
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Problem is though when you are able

768
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
To push that much details

769
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You have to also create that much detail

770
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And then development costs rise

771
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And so on and so forth

772
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So there is you know

773
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Kind of a

774
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Downside to everything

775
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's how Nintendo is kind of getting around it

776
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Because their system isn't really pushing that

777
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You know great graphics

778
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Although there are companies that will try to kind of

779
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Squeeze every ounce of

780
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know power out of the Wii

781
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know you don't have to

782
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Because their console doesn't look that

783
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I mean there's only so much they can do

784
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Graphic wise in there so

785
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Kind of to let the gameplay

786
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Shine through but with Sony though

787
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You know it's really all about

788
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Just trying to push

789
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Better graphics

790
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Better specs, better everything

791
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean that's really what they've been

792
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Doing from the get go

793
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's what they've been really pushing with

794
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You know remember with the Playstation 3

795
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
They're like oh yeah all the games are going to come out 10EP

796
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Everything is going to run at 120 frames per second

797
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's going to be super awesome

798
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You're just going to blow your load when you see anything on the screen

799
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You know that type of stuff

800
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And obviously that didn't really happen

801
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I mean a lot of this stuff comes out now

802
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
720p, nothing is running at 120 frames per second

803
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I mean TV's

804
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Most TV's out there don't even

805
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You wouldn't be able to see that so

806
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let me ask a weird like maybe tangent kind of question

807
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That I don't even know if it has an easy answer

808
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So I'm really posing this to Chad as well

809
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I know we say this a lot

810
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I've said this as a kid

811
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I've said this growing up

812
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I'm sure a lot of you did this too

813
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Like even back in the Nintendo days

814
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
8 bit NES days

815
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Dude games look so realistic now

816
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I don't know how they're going to look any better

817
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I mean it looks like a cartoon on my screen

818
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's awesome right

819
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We always kind of say that and then somehow they get better

820
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But I really feel like we're at this point now

821
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Where like Playstation 3

822
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And Xbox 360

823
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like the stuff that that renders

824
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Really is close to like DVD

825
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Blu-ray quality

826
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I mean what is left to improve

827
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
My eye cannot tell the difference

828
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That easily between 720p and 1080p

829
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
How are they going to justify

830
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
An upgrade to Playstation 4

831
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And the other thing too is

832
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I mean who knows what technology is going to be like

833
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
When the Playstation 4 comes out

834
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I mean how long did it take for them to develop

835
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
High definition and 720p

836
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And 1080p and so yeah it's only a few years

837
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean we have no idea

838
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What technology is going to be like then

839
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This kind of processor I wouldn't be surprised

840
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
If we see this in a future PC

841
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Processor or anything

842
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Where you can add

843
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Something beyond 4 cores

844
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You can just add as many cores as you want

845
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I mean granted

846
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Chip might be bigger or you have multiple processors

847
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
In there and stuff but

848
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't know it's interesting

849
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I guess I have to admit

850
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You have a pretty good argument there

851
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The thing that it will do we haven't thought of yet

852
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Or it would already be in the system

853
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Or they are just making it to do things

854
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That we haven't thought of yet

855
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What about and this might be crazy talk

856
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But especially with you know

857
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Avatar the movie having done so

858
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well

859
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
At the box office being so well received

860
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Especially as the visuals I mean

861
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I haven't seen it yet myself and I know I ragged

862
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
On it but clearly I must have

863
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Been wrong because everybody I know has been raving

864
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
About the movie even if they don't like the story

865
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Everybody is pretty consistent with

866
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But the visuals wow wow

867
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Wowie wow

868
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You know is this whole 3D

869
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Thing where maybe games are going

870
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I actually do want to go see it in IMAX

871
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Take me with you

872
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because I'm kind of wanting to see it now

873
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Like just so many people

874
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Are having such a big boner over it

875
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm like okay maybe I was wrong

876
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll go see the damn movie

877
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Let's go before I start school

878
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I could probably do that so we'll talk off air

879
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Anyhow I think I have

880
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
4 hours available on Thursday

881
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
This is right? 4 hours?

882
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's a James Cameron movie it's about 4 hours?

883
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
2 and a half hours

884
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I have a free screen for it this week

885
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Or this week in 3D but I've already seen it

886
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Whoa

887
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'll go

888
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Give me your tickets

889
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think it's on Tuesday

890
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Actually it is on Thursday

891
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Hey that's funny

892
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Maysatsuma in chat says

893
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The Playstation 4 will give you new eyes

894
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
To see its new better ultra graphics

895
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Dude you might be joking

896
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But if we're talking 3D you gotta have those glasses

897
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Right? That's new eyes of a source

898
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Not really, well yeah

899
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You do need the glasses

900
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I could see something for

901
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Realty where it's just polarized glasses

902
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Those things are cheap

903
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'd rather have that than $200 shutter glasses

904
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I guess the old rule of thumb is

905
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Gaming has to get closer and closer

906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
To the holodeck from Star Trek

907
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Is that every system

908
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Brings us one step closer to the holodeck

909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And 3D glasses

910
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Will be a pretty big step in that direction

911
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Until eventually

912
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
My Playstation 6

913
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Is just a room in my house

914
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That I walk into and you know computer

915
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Activate Final Fantasy

916
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Program and I am in the holodeck

917
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Basically

918
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's where gaming is headed right?

919
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
At least that's how I imagined it

920
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Well you remember we did have the U-Force

921
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The U-Suck

922
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The U-Force

923
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
My friend had one of those

924
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It did not work like you would think

925
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
In the advertisements that's for dang sure

926
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I've got one of the ones that came with

927
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh shoot

928
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What was that game that was on

929
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Genesis and then on Sega CD

930
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The Activator

931
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But now I can't remember the game

932
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It was a really cool game

933
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I will never forget when Loki took the Activator

934
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The Para Para Paradise controller

935
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No I thought about it

936
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Basically I just took it apart

937
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No actually I didn't even take it apart

938
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I just threw it away

939
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Or I don't know what I'd do with that

940
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I was going to though

941
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Tigerclaw says people will use the holodeck

942
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
More than just for video games if you know what I mean

943
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That's true there is the age old question

944
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
About any new peripheral or game device

945
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Or anything that is released

946
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That has to do with a piece of plastic

947
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
There is the age old question

948
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You have to ask

949
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Anytime you hear about a new peripheral

950
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Anytime you hear about something new being released

951
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The question is

952
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
How long until someone puts their dick in it

953
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Not necessarily how long

954
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's basically

955
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
As I've seen it before

956
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's TTP

957
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Is there a website dedicated to this

958
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
No there isn't

959
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's basically

960
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
How long will someone create a penis with it

961
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Or put their penis in it

962
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And install Linux on it

963
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's the other question

964
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Or use it in conjunction with their penis

965
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's basically

966
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
For example

967
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The Wii Vitality sensor

968
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
How long until someone puts a penis into that

969
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You know

970
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Xbox One is positive

971
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
LittleBigPlanet

972
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
How long until someone creates a penis in that

973
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That was like milliseconds

974
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There is a whole bunch of stuff like that

975
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But I mean that is a good point

976
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
If we get to the holodeck

977
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There's going to be guys that never leave the house

978
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean

979
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I hope the holodeck has a holo-bathroom

980
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Because people will live there

981
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's going to be strange

982
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Anyhow

983
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Alright hey

984
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Changing tones completely

985
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Something else that game devices do these days

986
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Is play movies

987
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And obviously digital distribution is getting big

988
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But some studios might have some second thoughts

989
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
This week Sony apparently

990
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Put the movie Armored

991
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Which is a new release that is playing in theaters right now

992
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I had not heard of this movie

993
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But it looks like the bow-pow

994
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Action type of flick that I would not usually see

995
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's Armored

996
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Is the movie

997
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And it's Matt Dillon

998
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And Laurence Fishburne

999
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And Jean Renaud

1000
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And all these people

1001
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Peter Petrelli is in it though

1002
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I see him in the poster

1003
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The movie

1004
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't know how it's doing at the box office

1005
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't think it's in the top ten

1006
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Because you've got Avatar

1007
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And the Sherlock Holmes

1008
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And the freaking chipmunks

1009
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
How did that happen?

1010
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And all this

1011
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well Armored, despite the fact that it's not doing well in theaters

1012
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Maybe this is not helping the case

1013
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It was available for download on the Playstation Store this week

1014
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That's right

1015
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You could actually download a movie

1016
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Already in theaters

1017
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Not just that, it was up for free

1018
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I call that the internet

1019
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Well yeah, but usually this type of thing is not like

1020
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Officially done by Sony

1021
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And to be honest

1022
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
This really wasn't either

1023
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It was of course

1024
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Whoopsie

1025
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Somebody accidentally put that thing up

1026
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Long before it should have gone up

1027
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And put it up for the price of free

1028
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But what I think is interesting about this

1029
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I mean, yeah, haha, point and laugh

1030
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
At Sony for whatever happened over this

1031
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But I find it interesting

1032
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That this movie was all ready to go

1033
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I mean, clearly

1034
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
This was the case of somebody pushing the button too early

1035
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Or pushing the wrong button

1036
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And causing this movie to go up on the site way early

1037
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But it was already encoded

1038
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It was already sitting on a server waiting to be dumped

1039
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It was just waiting for someone to throw the switch

1040
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I kind of find it interesting

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That the movies are at that point

1042
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Where

1043
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Nobody's waiting to

1044
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Deliver the movie to the service

1045
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I realize

1046
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I think this is one of Sony's studios that put the movie out

1047
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So maybe that's part of the reason

1048
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But I mean

1049
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Isn't that kind of weird

1050
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That it was sitting there on the store waiting to go

1051
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Like, probably all these movies

1052
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Are already sitting on the store

1053
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
People knew how to hack in there

1054
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Keep in mind that

1055
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And this even goes back to the VHS days

1056
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Is that there were often

1057
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Screener copies available for awards ceremonies

1058
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I actually had a copy of American Pie

1059
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Not American Pie

1060
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
American Beauty

1061
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
When

1062
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No, I take that back, I take that back

1063
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It was Titanic is what I had

1064
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I had a screening version of Titanic

1065
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
When it had just gotten out of the theater

1066
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Which was the only way I was going to see it

1067
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It was for free

1068
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, a really good friend of mine who may or may not be sitting in this room

1069
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Used to get those screener copies all the time

1070
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
No, not those kind of screener copies

1071
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Not the review screeners

1072
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The actual

1073
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
For your consideration

1074
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Oscar screeners

1075
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
They have screen copies of movies

1076
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Like, literally right, sometimes even before they come out

1077
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We watch Snakes on a Plane

1078
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
At my work

1079
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Right before we went to theaters

1080
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And

1081
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yay, but you know

1082
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I saw that at Disneyland

1083
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's done, you know, it can be done

1084
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah, but I don't think Playstation 3

1085
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Is being used as a screening service

1086
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's kind of interesting if it could be

1087
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm kind of surprised

1088
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
With piracy and everything going on

1089
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm kind of surprised they don't have a device

1090
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It'll be funny if that copy gets ripped

1091
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And just, you know, dumped

1092
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm sure it already happened

1093
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It happened long before you thought of it

1094
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Here's the thing though

1095
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I don't care about that movie at all

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
If I saw it for free

1097
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I'd be like, nope, still don't want to watch it

1098
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Sorry

1099
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I have better things to do

1100
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
For an hour and a half

1101
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, but still

1102
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm gonna say call like weird on the whole

1103
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You know, it was up on the marketplace

1104
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Long before it should have been

1105
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Right?

1106
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah

1107
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That does kind of go without saying

1108
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Well, I'm sure somebody's gonna get a write-up

1109
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Over that one

1110
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We'll see what happens now

1111
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Someone's probably pissing their pants

1112
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Probably already fired

1113
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, how about

1114
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I think this is strange news at all

1115
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But Final Fantasy 13 sales have actually decreased

1116
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
From how they were during the release

1117
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It actually

1118
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't see why that's a really big thing

1119
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Because, I mean

1120
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Just about when anything comes out

1121
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Especially something big like that

1122
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Everyone's gonna be picking up their copy during the first week

1123
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It had a million plus release day

1124
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Broke records for the first week

1125
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And then it

1126
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Basically dropped

1127
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
About a million units

1128
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Into the second week

1129
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It did take a dip

1130
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Because everyone's already bought it

1131
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Also, Squeenix

1132
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Is pretty much like

1133
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
When it gets the worldwide release

1134
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
We're gonna hit our numbers

1135
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So they're not too worried about it

1136
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I think another thing, especially with Final Fantasy 13

1137
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Dude, they released it the week before Christmas

1138
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So of course the second week

1139
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I mean, I don't know how big

1140
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Of a holiday Christmas is in Japan

1141
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Compared to here, I'm imagining it's not quite the same

1142
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Big deal and same shopping patterns

1143
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That we have here

1144
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But, you know, still

1145
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's gotta have some impact

1146
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You don't really have the amount of holiday purchasing

1147
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Going on in the second week

1148
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
When you release your game the week before

1149
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
A big holiday, right?

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm sure that's a part of it too

1151
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But I kinda get where this is going

1152
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
They talk about this in movies a lot

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And the late drop off can usually tell you

1154
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Like the longevity of a movie

1155
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Sometimes you have these sequels that come out

1156
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And they drop off huge in the second week

1157
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And that means the movie's probably not gonna do very well

1158
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Even if it had a good weekend

1159
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But other movies like, well, Avatar

1160
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
For example

1161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Is not showing a lot of signs of slowing down

1162
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't think it's gonna have the longevity of a movie

1163
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Like Titanic

1164
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But it's been dropping off very slowly

1165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
In its first few weeks of release

1166
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And doesn't look like it's gonna slow down

1167
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The Oscar season gets rip roaring

1168
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So, you know, I think

1169
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
A lot of game companies like to see that happen

1170
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
With a game

1171
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But yeah, Final Fantasy, you sort of expect this is gonna happen

1172
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Most Final Fantasy fanboys and girls are pretty rabid

1173
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
They go out and buy it the first day

1174
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And, you know, you're not gonna see the same

1175
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Type of sales the second and third week

1176
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I think the same thing's gonna happen here in the US

1177
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And in Europe

1178
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Huge first week sales, huge drop off second week

1179
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
90% drop off second week

1180
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And unfortunately they're just not releasing it

1181
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
In a time like Christmas

1182
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Where it's gonna sell consistently

1183
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You know, March is kind of a weird month

1184
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
They should have already had it ready

1185
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, we'll see

1186
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Alright, so other things

1187
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You know

1188
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Might cause the drop off of Final Fantasy 13

1189
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Would be

1190
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Wiiwa

1191
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay, well maybe not

1192
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But, um

1193
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Wiiwa is this thing

1194
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think I talked about on the show before

1195
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Where I got my Cage Match song

1196
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
D-A-N-C-E

1197
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
From

1198
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
At least the idea for it

1199
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Basically, Wiiwa is a brand new game that's coming out

1200
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And

1201
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's using a unique

1202
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Kind of a

1203
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Controller attachment

1204
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Basically it's this big stuffed animal

1205
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I guess it would be a Wiiwa

1206
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That you shove the remote into

1207
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And you kind of

1208
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Walk it around and jump

1209
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And do all sorts of weird stuff with it

1210
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
To control the character in game

1211
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's like a

1212
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Muppet, basically, you have your own Muppet

1213
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Something like that, yeah

1214
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You shove your Wiimote up its ass

1215
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And you can make it dance and sing

1216
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So, um

1217
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It looks neat

1218
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I guess, I don't know

1219
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
What kind of game is it?

1220
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Is it a Pet Sim game? Is it like an action game?

1221
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
No, it's like an action game

1222
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's like something you'd see from Rare or something even

1223
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Just kind of a little

1224
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Platformer game where you walk around and you sneak up

1225
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
On enemies and stuff like that

1226
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
They have little mini games in there

1227
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Including one that I guess the Wiiwa has these

1228
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Bungee cord things on it

1229
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Where you can fling it into the air

1230
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And you kind of do that

1231
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Almost like a spring

1232
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm pulling up a little video here in studio

1233
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Courtesy of our chat room

1234
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Wow

1235
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I just crashed the Bandicoot

1236
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh, you put the Wiimote in its mouth

1237
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So you force feed it

1238
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Okay

1239
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh, so you have to like

1240
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Shake the thing around

1241
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That's kind of cute

1242
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Back and forth and stuff

1243
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That's adorable

1244
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It is kind of cute, like I noticed that

1245
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's not aimed at adults

1246
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They have a little six year old kid

1247
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In the video

1248
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You're sneaking up and then

1249
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You've got to duck down

1250
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's cute

1251
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I would totally play this

1252
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He's got a little play cord thing

1253
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's great

1254
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You know what though

1255
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm a little worried

1256
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Doesn't this seem like the type of thing that probably works way better

1257
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
In the preview than it does in real life

1258
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Like you're probably throwing this guy around

1259
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And it's just like fucking move the way I want you to

1260
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah, but if they've got a kid doing it

1261
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Well, come on

1262
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This is all cut and paste

1263
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He's not actually playing the game

1264
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I want to actually see

1265
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
A practical demo of this

1266
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So

1267
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Interesting

1268
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Although I will point out

1269
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That little stuffed animal has a hole in its mouth

1270
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Time to penis, 15 seconds

1271
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Just saying

1272
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's a new peripheral

1273
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It has to be measured, no pun intended

1274
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That's true

1275
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Speaking of

1276
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Speaking of adorable and cute games

1277
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Although this one I don't think Jamie plays quite as much

1278
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Maybe she should though

1279
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And if she wants to know where to begin

1280
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
LittleBigPlanet has done the first annual

1281
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
SAKI awards

1282
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Or that they're calling them the Sakademy awards

1283
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I think that's a really cute little pun there

1284
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The Sakademy awards

1285
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Media Molecule has been giving out all these types of awards

1286
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Did you know there's 1.5 million LittleBigPlanet levels right now

1287
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Holy crap

1288
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That's a lot

1289
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Like stupid levels

1290
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Probably 1.49 million

1291
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Really bad levels

1292
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's still a lot though if you have 100,000 good levels

1293
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That's true

1294
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Some of the awards that they gave out

1295
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Best Mashima video

1296
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Best visuals and use of special effects

1297
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Best use of story in a level

1298
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And all more

1299
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The best visuals one was pretty awesome

1300
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It was a post-apocalyptic

1301
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I think was the name of it

1302
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And it actually had really good lighting

1303
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And explosion effects in there which is pretty awesome

1304
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I saw one where the Sakboy would step on a switch

1305
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And then this piano just started to play Beethoven

1306
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And it wasn't even one of those musical levels

1307
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Where you hang on to the vehicle and it plays a song

1308
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
As you run through the level

1309
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But no, an actual piano came down

1310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And little feet would dance on the keys and play Beethoven

1311
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I was like, good god this game is crazy

1312
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
In a good way

1313
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The things people do with it is insane

1314
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But here's

1315
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Here's what LittleBigPlanet needs

1316
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
One thing I think is missing right now

1317
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Is that if you go in to play custom levels

1318
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think the interface right now for playing custom levels

1319
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Is still a little eh

1320
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
What they need to do is take these award winners

1321
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And put them on a separate planet or something

1322
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Or put them in a separate menu

1323
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Something where I can go straight to the best

1324
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Where I can weed through all the crap that's out there

1325
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And just go straight to these levels I have to see

1326
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I wonder if they had a category for best trophy whoring level

1327
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Because remember when the game first came out

1328
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
All the high rated levels were like

1329
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Earn seven trophies in thirty seconds

1330
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Exclamation exclamation one one one

1331
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I was looking at some of the other ones on there

1332
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Of course the Contra one

1333
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
One for best collaboration which is awesome

1334
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
All the Contra levels

1335
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
As it should have

1336
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
There was

1337
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Best

1338
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Logic device or something like that

1339
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Or computer

1340
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And it was the LittleBigPlanet calculator

1341
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
LittleBigPlanet calculator because that was really

1342
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Really involved

1343
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
There was

1344
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm trying to think what some of the other ones were

1345
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
There was like a best community project

1346
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I didn't understand what that was

1347
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I think it was just like tools

1348
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
They had logic tools that you could use for your

1349
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Your machines and stuff

1350
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But yeah definitely check out

1351
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The post apocalyptic level because that looked pretty

1352
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Our good friend Bobby

1353
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Is in chat and says

1354
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
They might be in the news section Sky

1355
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I forgot LittleBigPlanet had a news section but that's a good point

1356
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Although I wonder if it will link directly to the levels

1357
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I mean I'm sure it says something about the awards

1358
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
In the news section but I wonder if it

1359
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Would link directly to the levels I don't know

1360
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
At the same time when I have been

1361
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Playing LittleBigPlanet recently I've been checking out

1362
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Those new Pirates of the Caribbean levels so

1363
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I haven't had time to check out this academy winners

1364
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
How'd you like those?

1365
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It was cute I didn't play a whole lot

1366
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So I can't really give you a full review yet but

1367
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I was kind of surprised that you

1368
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Can't stay under water very long

1369
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There's a lot of things later that increase your breathing time

1370
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And things I haven't gotten to yet

1371
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You can get scuba gear that

1372
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Allows you to breathe under water

1373
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Forever

1374
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So you can get that

1375
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I figured that was there yeah

1376
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I did like how the water can raise and lower

1377
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
There was one part of the very first level

1378
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Where you can flood the town

1379
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And then you bring the flood down

1380
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It was kind of neat

1381
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I do

1382
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I just love the fact that LittleBigPlanet

1383
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Is still being supported

1384
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And that they haven't taken that route

1385
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That I think some developers would have and put all this

1386
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
In LittleBigPlanet 2

1387
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
They've really been supporting this one game

1388
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You know it's

1389
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
A really good Playstation 3 value I gotta say

1390
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I've colored me impressed

1391
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You know I named it my game of the year

1392
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Last year and I still stand by it

1393
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I think that's one of the greatest games

1394
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They've released in quite some time

1395
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But

1396
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Maybe I'm just biased I don't know

1397
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Anyhow moving on with more news and we'll get to release dates

1398
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
DarkSakura what do you got for us?

1399
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I have some news about

1400
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Sonic Racing

1401
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
For 360

1402
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Not Sonic R just to clarify

1403
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But there's actually going to be

1404
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Characters that you can use

1405
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
For Sonic Racing namely your avatars

1406
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Will be playable and

1407
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Banjo Kazooie

1408
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
While I really don't give a crap about Banjo

1409
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I actually think it would be pretty cool to go ahead

1410
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And use my

1411
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
My avatar and the other

1412
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Characters in the game too are

1413
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Of course Sonic Tails, Shadow

1414
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I from Super Monkey Ball

1415
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Samba

1416
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Samba de Amigo Monkey

1417
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Beat from Jet Set Radio

1418
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Alex Kidd, Billy Hatcher

1419
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Whoa whoa whoa

1420
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Sega is acknowledging Jet Set Radio?

1421
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes

1422
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's good right?

1423
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Alex Kidd

1424
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh wow when was the last time we had an Alex Kidd game?

1425
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Billy Hatcher

1426
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And Ryo Hazuki

1427
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The guy from Shenmue

1428
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Wow it's like Sega is like

1429
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Throwing bones at all these like

1430
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Fan like dammit we need

1431
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
A new Jet Set Future, Jet Set Radio

1432
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Dammit we need a new Shenmue and now they're like

1433
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
They're teasing us with this silly little

1434
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Racing game

1435
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Well you remember when they teased us with having knights

1436
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
In that stupid

1437
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Eye Toy game

1438
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Oh yeah knights in the game?

1439
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But they said that there's

1440
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Rumors though that other possibilities is

1441
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Ulala and

1442
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Akira from

1443
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Virtua Fighter and Vice from Skies of Arcadia

1444
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Now they're just being mean

1445
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like we all know there's not gonna be

1446
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Another Space Channel 5 game so

1447
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
There could be

1448
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Space Channel 5

1449
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I really wish there would be but like

1450
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They're just being mean by putting Ulala in the game

1451
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Like that's just rude

1452
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Space Michaels in the game

1453
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
If they put Pudding Da in there

1454
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm gonna scream

1455
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Cause she was my favorite

1456
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
She was my favorite

1457
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
For me, sorry, it was Jaguar

1458
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Cause we come with TAAAAA

1459
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
With this little group

1460
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Please please please if you've never heard of Space Channel 5

1461
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You really owe it to yourself to go look at the videos on YouTube

1462
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Or try to find a copy if you can

1463
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
On Dreamcast or Playstation 2

1464
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
They had the collection

1465
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh man I love that game

1466
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I really wish they'd bring that back

1467
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Because I cannot believe

1468
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And I'm hanging my head in shame

1469
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
As I'm even talking about this

1470
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I bought stupid Barbie crap

1471
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
For my avatar cause I'm ridiculous

1472
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But it was

1473
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Why are you sighing at me Loki?

1474
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Don't judge me

1475
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Stop judging me

1476
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Why?

1477
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Why bother

1478
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Buying stuff for your avatar?

1479
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Because it was really funny

1480
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It made me laugh cause it's in the band hero section

1481
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
There's a microphone

1482
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And it has a giant purple ribbon

1483
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Like the kind some 16 year old

1484
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Girl would have

1485
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
In her band

1486
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think it was the Taylor Swift microphone

1487
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I bought that cause

1488
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I liked karaoke and all that stuff

1489
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It was really funny and it made me laugh

1490
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
When my avatar was dancing with it

1491
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But then I was thinking

1492
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
If I'm playing this racing game or whatever

1493
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You're not gonna see that microphone shoved in the back of the car

1494
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Boo

1495
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It would be funny

1496
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Remember that racing game that they had out

1497
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
That was free to download and then they have all those

1498
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Expansions you have to buy and stuff to it

1499
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
On 360?

1500
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Well keep in mind I've been asleep for the past 5 months

1501
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
On 360 so no

1502
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh did it?

1503
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I think

1504
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I don't know

1505
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Honestly because

1506
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
No I don't know if it came out because I would have downloaded it

1507
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Cause it would have been free

1508
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't know

1509
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
How behind I am

1510
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I just finally downloaded my

1511
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Copy of

1512
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Madballs

1513
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Nice

1514
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I've had the code for it forever

1515
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh yeah I should probably download that

1516
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh yeah well come on here I am on the show

1517
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Going hey guys

1518
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Shadow Complex wow what a great game

1519
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Most people are like yeah didn't you get the memo like 6 months ago

1520
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So many games

1521
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So little time keep in mind

1522
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
We all have day jobs

1523
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Your game sites you like to go surf and all that

1524
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
They get paid to play games 8 hours a day

1525
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And all that we don't do that

1526
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
We have to work in our free time so

1527
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Sometimes we can't play everything

1528
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And by the way chat there's a lot of folks in chat saying

1529
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like Misty says

1530
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Barbie crap I bought a cell phone and I got the

1531
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Free chocobo I waste enough money

1532
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
On rock band download content

1533
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Act Def said I would have expected Disney stuff

1534
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But Barbie come on Rob I wasn't being literal

1535
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It wasn't literally Barbie

1536
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But I call it that because

1537
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I mean it's basically the same thing it's like a dress your Barbie doll

1538
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And there's no

1539
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I did pay for avatar content

1540
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Did I tell you? What'd you buy?

1541
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I got one of the steampunk outfits

1542
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I actually have left over points

1543
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Do you have one of those ginormous helmets or something?

1544
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
No I got like the duster jacket with the

1545
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Kinda gypsy top

1546
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But I'm actually planning on

1547
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Getting the rest of the steampunk set

1548
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Because I actually I don't really buy much with my points

1549
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Dan usually puts all the points on his account

1550
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And buys this stuff for us

1551
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So I was gonna go ahead and get

1552
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
The rest of the steampunk outfit because I think

1553
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The stuff's cute

1554
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I have sim stuff what's the difference?

1555
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
One of the games I didn't mention

1556
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
During my gaming week but I did play for a little while

1557
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Was One vs. 100 and I was actually cracking up

1558
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Because you know sometimes it'll show these random

1559
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
People in the mob who get questions right

1560
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Or wrong and like it cracks

1561
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
My shit up when like I see this person wearing

1562
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Just like a t-shirt and jeans but they

1563
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Have one of those like uber robot helmets

1564
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
On their avatar and it's like

1565
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
That looks hideous like

1566
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And 45,000 people just saw how stupid your avatar looks like

1567
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And they couldn't be happier

1568
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Then again I have a princess microphone

1569
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So who am I to judge?

1570
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Who am I to judge?

1571
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
At least you didn't buy a fake cat

1572
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I didn't buy a fake cat

1573
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Alright let's travel the world and look at some release dates

1574
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
If there are any

1575
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
This week actually there's some pretty decent stuff coming out

1576
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1577
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We have Darksiders from THQ

1578
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Will be making its way out this week

1579
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Also Fable 2 is getting a

1580
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Platinum Hits version

1581
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Coming out this week

1582
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
With the download content of course

1583
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
For 30 bucks

1584
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Newer games though, Bayonetta finally making its way out

1585
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week

1586
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So definitely worth picking that one up

1587
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Fast Food Panic on the Nintendo DS

1588
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Making its way out

1589
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And

1590
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Not really gaming related

1591
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But the Guinness Book of World Records

1592
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Gamer's Edition

1593
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Is making its way out to book stands as well

1594
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And you should at least

1595
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Thump through it but I don't know if you should

1596
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Pay them for it you know

1597
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Unless your coffee table is empty and you need some

1598
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Or honestly the top of your toilet

1599
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is needed some new material who knows

1600
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Trust me for 15 bucks

1601
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You can find some better magazines for that

1602
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Hell that's a few playboys or penthouses

1603
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Geez

1604
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
If you're looking for more toilet

1605
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Stuff you know I'm seriously

1606
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Better than the Guinness Book

1607
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Do we really need to see

1608
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh hey look Batman Arkham Asylum

1609
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Was the greatest game ever

1610
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Guinness says it must be true

1611
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Or do you want to see some tits

1612
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Or do you want to see some badge

1613
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I just want to point out

1614
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Some of our listeners are like 16, 17

1615
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
If you realize this right

1616
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Welcome to adulthood

1617
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Don't you know you're supposed to say twat

1618
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And seriously

1619
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
They know as well as I do

1620
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That the Guinness Book of World Records

1621
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Gamer's Edition is crap okay

1622
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I only looked at it one time

1623
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
The 2009 or 2008

1624
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Who cares they all suck

1625
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because I was killing time while my wife looked for books

1626
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And I was just like

1627
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Okay I've read this magazine read this magazine

1628
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Hey Gamer's Edition let's see this is crap

1629
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That's it for releases

1630
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Unfortunately

1631
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You only have those magazines for the articles

1632
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Of course right

1633
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Actually the articles are really boring

1634
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Some of the forums are funny

1635
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But the articles suck

1636
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Alright moving on

1637
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Let's look at Japanese release dates

1638
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
How we go from that to Japanese release dates

1639
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I have no idea but we do

1640
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan

1641
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
James Cameron's Avatar the game

1642
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Gets it's Japanese localization

1643
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
From Ubisoft this week

1644
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
On the 7th of January

1645
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's when the games are coming out

1646
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That is also making it's way to the Playstation 3

1647
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Just so you know

1648
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Also I want to point out

1649
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Speaking of Batman Arkham Asylum

1650
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That is finally making it's way to Japan next week

1651
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It will not be on the 7th

1652
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But it will be on the 14th

1653
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So you'll probably hear me say it again next week

1654
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The Wii is empty this week

1655
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
There's really not a lot to look forward to there

1656
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So is the Playstation 2

1657
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
On the PSP

1658
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You got Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep

1659
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And I think that's pretty much your other

1660
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Big big big game this week

1661
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Did you see the trailer for that?

1662
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I have seen little bits and pieces

1663
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
If you go to the website for it

1664
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The trailer is freaking amazing

1665
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Then put it on the console

1666
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
This is my biggest bitch about these

1667
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Portable games

1668
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Did you hear

1669
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Earlier this week

1670
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
On the DSI

1671
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Like

1672
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Old school Apple 2E or this new shit

1673
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
This new shit

1674
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Pass

1675
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm like you don't have direction

1676
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Keys on the

1677
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
DS in order to

1678
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Shoot

1679
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I bet in these new games do you shoot

1680
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Like 5 Buffalo and then like congratulations

1681
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You shot 3400 pounds of food

1682
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Unfortunately you can only carry 100

1683
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Back to the wagon

1684
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I somehow doubt it

1685
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I remember that

1686
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Good times

1687
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I was gonna say there's actually

1688
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Another Oregon Trail game that I linked

1689
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
In our show roll

1690
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You have to see it's Oregon Trail of Physics

1691
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's awesome

1692
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The Oregon Trail of Physics?

1693
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
No, Oregon Trail with Physics

1694
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
What is this? Did it not make the show roll tonight?

1695
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Then tell us about it

1696
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's this game, it's not even really called the Oregon Trail

1697
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But it is exactly the Oregon Trail

1698
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's basically

1699
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
The Oregon Trail

1700
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You stuff your cart full of crap

1701
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Whatever you're carrying with you

1702
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And you take

1703
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's like combining the Oregon Trail with

1704
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That sledding game

1705
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I don't remember what it was

1706
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You like jump hills

1707
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You're oxed

1708
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Just start running down the hill and then

1709
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You go off of it and fly and stuff

1710
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And if you land upside down like people get injured

1711
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Stuff like that

1712
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I've seen a Flash game like that

1713
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Somebody skinned that with the Oregon Trail basically

1714
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah, it's

1715
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
What was it called here?

1716
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It is

1717
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Let's go find El Dorado

1718
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
How do you die of dysentery in the game?

1719
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Is that possible?

1720
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
There's a video of it

1721
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Is it a Flash game?

1722
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It might be a Flash game

1723
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I don't know

1724
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm gonna look into this while Dark Sakura

1725
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Covers the UK releases

1726
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You know, it's funny

1727
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I was just saying

1728
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What was it called? The Road to El Dorado?

1729
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I was just watching the Mysterious Cities of Gold last night

1730
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So I thought that was funny

1731
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Hello Random!

1732
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It is Random!

1733
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's on Hulu now, Rob

1734
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The Mysterious Cities of Gold

1735
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They have all this crazy stuff on Hulu

1736
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Oh my god, look, he's showing me a picture

1737
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Hahahahaha

1738
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Let me see

1739
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Oh, this is terrible radio

1740
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I want to see if we have sound effects that I can play

1741
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Geez

1742
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Ok, well how about UK releases?

1743
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Which are, um, yeah, two

1744
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
There's Bayonetta

1745
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And Darksiders

1746
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And that's it

1747
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Happy New Year!

1748
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
No surprise, though, that it's pretty smart

1749
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Bayonetta!

1750
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Although, yeah, Bayonetta's a big, big release

1751
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Can't believe they didn't try to crank that out in time for Christmas

1752
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Especially because it did get its release over there

1753
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
In Japan

1754
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Maybe they're just hoping for big sales off of gift cards

1755
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I don't know

1756
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I don't know

1757
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
What?

1758
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I know, I'm very excited about this game

1759
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Oh, here's a little YouTube, let me see if this

1760
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I don't know if this has sound effects or anything

1761
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But this is the Oregon Trail

1762
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It's like a little frog croaking or something

1763
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
What the hell is that?

1764
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It's upside down

1765
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Did it just fart?

1766
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
People do get dysentery in that

1767
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
This game looks amazing

1768
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I guess it's more like Excite

1769
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Excite, um, bike with

1770
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
the Oregon Trail

1771
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Somebody has typhoid right now

1772
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's like extra physics physics

1773
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Where is this game available at?

1774
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I want it totally

1775
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Ludum Dare dot com

1776
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
L-U-D-U-M-D-A-R-E dot com

1777
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You should post that in chat, Rob

1778
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I will do that right now

1779
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Good!

1780
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm excited that you're doing that, Rob

1781
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Just while I'm posting that in chat

1782
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Uh, Loki

1783
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Okay

1784
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Um, let's see

1785
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I got so distracted by

1786
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oregon Trail-ish games

1787
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Um, anyways

1788
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So, some more fun stuff

1789
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Uh, Google, they have

1790
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Uh, patented

1791
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Something that's actually

1792
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Hinting to possible gaming

1793
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Uh, coming to

1794
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
YouTube, well

1795
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I mean, I guess it kind of makes sense if you think about it

1796
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Um, they

1797
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Were saying that there's already

1798
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Some kind of interactive games on

1799
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
YouTube, uh, kind of done with

1800
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Videos, sort of like your choose your own

1801
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Adventure type stuff

1802
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But they were saying that the patent titled

1803
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Web-based system for general

1804
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
General, what was it, um

1805
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Generation of interactive games based on

1806
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Digital videos

1807
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Um, was filed

1808
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Earlier this year, or I guess last year

1809
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And it was

1810
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Um

1811
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
They didn't really see what exactly it's

1812
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Gonna be, but it sounds like

1813
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Something that, um

1814
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Links videos together, creating different

1815
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Narratives and alternatives, and different scenarios

1816
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
For the users, so

1817
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So, Mark, you mark create your own video?

1818
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Something, probably something

1819
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
So that you can create your own, kind of choose

1820
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Your own adventure stuff, although I wouldn't be

1821
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Surprised if they did add like casual games

1822
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
To YouTube or something like that

1823
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Or you could just play like little flash games

1824
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I mean, that would fit right in I would think

1825
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I don't know

1826
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You know what this reminds me of is how on YouTube

1827
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Like you sometimes see these YouTube things, it's like

1828
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I want to say there's some channel

1829
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Where it's like, play rock paper

1830
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Scissors with me, and you click on the little

1831
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Links to go to other YouTubes

1832
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Like, you know, you pick whatever

1833
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And then you see if you win or not

1834
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Really stupid stuff, so they've patented

1835
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That now? Apparently

1836
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Weird, I wonder if they're planning on like

1837
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Making a game out of it, or what

1838
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
What they're gonna do

1839
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
YouTube the game

1840
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I don't know how I feel about that

1841
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I have to be honest, it's a little strange to me

1842
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
But whatever

1843
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Does it make you feel dirty inside, Rob?

1844
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
No, it just is weird

1845
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I really don't have a lot else to add to it

1846
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But that, it's just weird

1847
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Alright, what's not as weird

1848
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Because, you know, there's a lot of folks that are really

1849
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Into classic games and respecting the classics

1850
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And so forth

1851
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
There is a project going on at the Atari Museum

1852
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Where they're actually reconstructing

1853
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
A lot of the old proprietary

1854
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Chips, things from the 2600

1855
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And the VCS, also known as

1856
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
The Atari 5200

1857
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And Atari's old 8-bit computers

1858
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
They're actually using data that was recovered

1859
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
From old tapes

1860
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Used in the original manufacturing

1861
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
The Atari Museum's

1862
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Kurt Vendell has noted that

1863
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
The project has a practical application

1864
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Besides just, you know, it being history

1865
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
What's the potential of this?

1866
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Having the chips in smaller SMT packaging

1867
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And potentially bringing back to life

1868
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Some of the later CMOS designs of combo chips

1869
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Which could lead to a

1870
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
SOC, or system on a chip

1871
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
The future just got a little brighter

1872
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
In terms of preserving and continuing the legacy

1873
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Of Atari's custom IC chips

1874
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But I kind of go, well

1875
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I think of the flashback and stuff

1876
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
But of course that's more of a console

1877
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So they're talking about just the whole dang thing

1878
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Right there on a chip

1879
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah, I mean, it's like

1880
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Those flashback consoles, like for example

1881
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Though you'll see a lot of

1882
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Nintendos on a chip

1883
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I mean, it's probably not one chip

1884
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But it's a few chips, but really shrunken down

1885
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Like those little knock-off

1886
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Nintendo systems and stuff

1887
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That they sell at the mall

1888
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That Nintendo gets pissed at

1889
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Or the flea market

1890
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Tons and tons of those things

1891
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Oh yeah, those are great for turning them into

1892
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Little portable or arcade

1893
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Systems and stuff

1894
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But you know

1895
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I'm all for, of course, the

1896
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Preservation and stuff

1897
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I really get a kick out of when they

1898
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Have this, you know, they used to have it at E3 some time ago

1899
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And even when I went to

1900
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Classic Gaming Expo once a few years ago

1901
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Just getting a look at all the old

1902
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Shit, and just seeing how games

1903
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Got to where they are now

1904
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Or, you know, when you start to get in your 30s and all that stuff

1905
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
You start to go, I remember when that was out

1906
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I remember when that was out, I remember playing that

1907
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm sure it's

1908
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Worse for others than it was for me

1909
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
But boy, going to one of those made me feel

1910
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Very old

1911
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But I'm glad that that stuff

1912
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Will be preserved and hopefully made more

1913
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Portable to future generations

1914
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Speaking of classics

1915
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We always like to take a moment to

1916
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Pay some tribute to classic games

1917
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
When Dark Soccer takes

1918
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
A trip into the vault every week and pulls out

1919
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
A game that she says, you know what, folks?

1920
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You should be playing this game

1921
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Or you should check out this game, maybe you didn't know about it before

1922
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
But it's our classic video game of the week

1923
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And it's preserved in our Orange Lounge Radio Museum

1924
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Forever

1925
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Forever and ever

1926
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Which we call the Wiki

1927
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So Dark Soccer, what game are you lavishing

1928
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Praise upon this week?

1929
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
First of all, the wrong link

1930
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Let me actually find the right link again

1931
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Uh oh

1932
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah, because this isn't the link that I posted in the thing

1933
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Might have just broke on its way or something

1934
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So, don't know what to tell you there

1935
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Okay, there we go

1936
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Um, the game is

1937
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Chōjiki yōsai

1938
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Macross oboete imasu ka?

1939
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Which is, Macross, do you remember love?

1940
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Which, of course, we know there was

1941
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
An anime movie

1942
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And actually, let's listen to the music for a second

1943
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You know the music?

1944
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
That was the scrambled music

1945
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
From the actual Macross movies

1946
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Explosions!

1947
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Sorry, speakers

1948
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It's a shooter based off of the

1949
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Macross anime

1950
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And this one actually has to do

1951
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
With sort of

1952
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
According to

1953
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The creator

1954
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Kawamori Shōji

1955
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
That this is not an

1956
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Exact final word on what happened

1957
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
With the crew

1958
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Of the SDF-2 Megarode 1

1959
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Which was the ship

1960
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That was taking everybody else

1961
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
To, you know, discover what was

1962
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
At the center of the galaxy

1963
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Um, this is just

1964
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Sort of like a dramatization

1965
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
About what might have happened

1966
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
But you basically

1967
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It shows you, you know, leaving Earth

1968
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And, you know, fighting, you know

1969
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
A bunch of Zentradi everywhere

1970
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And it was

1971
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Actually a pretty, pretty cool

1972
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Game, it's one of my favorites

1973
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And they actually had

1974
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
New dialogue recorded for

1975
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
The game when it came out

1976
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
By Mari Ijima

1977
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Who was Min May's voice actor

1978
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And yeah, Min May is still annoying

1979
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But, she's Min May

1980
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
But lots of, you know

1981
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Shooting, you could lock on

1982
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Different enemies

1983
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
In foreground and everything

1984
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It was pretty cool

1985
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And it also came out on PlayStation

1986
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And I actually have both copies

1987
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Don't ask

1988
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I came into them somehow or another

1989
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
For cheap

1990
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It really is, you know

1991
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'd say for any Macross fan

1992
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It is the game you should have

1993
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I've got actually a ton of

1994
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Macross games, I've got

1995
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The

1996
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Macross Plus game

1997
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I have Macross M3 for Dreamcast

1998
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
But of all of them I think

1999
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
This one is probably my favorite

2000
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Did I take the back? There's one on PC Engine

2001
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
That I really like, but this one is

2002
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
The more easily accessible one that I like

2003
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It's definitely

2004
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
One that any

2005
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Macross and shooter fan should have

2006
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I mean, is that not just epic?

2007
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm not as familiar with the

2008
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Anime series, but it certainly looks like a

2009
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Heck of a shooter, but your

2010
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Your plane is huge

2011
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It takes up a pretty big chunk of the screen

2012
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I'm kind of surprised there

2013
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Between different modes

2014
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
As you see it's in the

2015
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
The full on robot mode, there's a

2016
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Girl walk mode which is like a half way in between

2017
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But

2018
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
This did come out of here as Robotech

2019
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Gotcha

2020
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It's pretty epic

2021
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Pretty cool game

2022
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Alright

2023
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Well there it is folks, your classic

2024
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Game of the week

2025
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Macross Do You Remember Love?

2026
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
On the Saturday

2027
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Check it out

2028
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Oh you know Dark Soccer

2029
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Loves her Saturn games

2030
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And we're starting off 2010 no differently

2031
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
We're going to take a quick break and when we come back

2032
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
We'll have plenty more of Orange Launch Radio

2033
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
We've got some quick news for you this week

2034
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Including what's latest and greatest on the Virtual Console

2035
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And iPhone games and Rock Band

2036
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And we do have some other news

2037
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
We're going to get into, including 8-bit

2038
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
NES developments, yes, believe it or not

2039
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And video games

2040
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Meet obscure Winter Olympic Sports

2041
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I kid you not

2042
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And of course, Listless

2043
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Tonight's topic for Listless

2044
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And if you've never done Listless before, please please join us

2045
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And chat because the chat room plays a big big role in this

2046
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com

2047
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Tonight's topic, Thing I

2048
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Most Want to Happen in Gaming

2049
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
In 2010

2050
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
This could get very interesting because as you know

2051
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Sometimes we're serious and sometimes

2052
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
We're not

2053
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Let's get back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2054
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2055
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
We are live on this January

2056
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
The 3rd, 2010

2057
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
That's right, our first show

2058
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Of the new decade

2059
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well, okay, you could get into that whole argument that the decade

2060
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Doesn't really begin until it's a one

2061
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Because, you know, the first

2062
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But we're going by VH1's rules, okay

2063
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So just, you know, everybody else says the new decades

2064
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
There you go

2065
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Anyhow, whatever it is, it's the first show of the year

2066
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And we're here to talk about gaming news

2067
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Although it's been somewhat of a light news week

2068
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Obviously, the holidays are still going on

2069
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Lots of companies

2070
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Either furloughed their workers

2071
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Or forced PTO on their workers

2072
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And I'm sure a lot of the game companies were no different

2073
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
This week, and probably the publishing companies

2074
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That run a lot of the stories too

2075
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And PR firms

2076
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
All kind of taking the week off

2077
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So I'm sure that's part of the reason why it's very quiet

2078
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But with a very full first quarter this year

2079
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
In fact, more so than other years past

2080
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
That I can think of

2081
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
News is going to pick up in the next few weeks

2082
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So we'll stay on top of it the best we can

2083
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Especially, I think, in a couple weeks

2084
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
We've got CES

2085
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Oh, that's true

2086
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
There's sometimes a surprise or two

2087
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I mean, CES is more of like the TVs

2088
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And the home devices

2089
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Well, it's technology, but hey, you know

2090
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
There are some gaming things that come out of that

2091
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Or you might see Aibo too

2092
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I mean, I don't think we'll see Aibo too

2093
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I don't think we will either

2094
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Doesn't bow well

2095
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Outlook not good

2096
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
By the way, Listlist coming up later this hour as well

2097
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Because, you know, somebody pointed out to me

2098
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You guys haven't done an OLR game in like a year

2099
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And I'm like, you know, I don't think

2100
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Since we moved to Studio Dark Sakura

2101
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Have we done a single game

2102
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And a lot of that is because we're in a tighter space

2103
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Now than we used to be, so we don't have a lot of guests in here

2104
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
That will be changing

2105
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That hopefully will be changing as we get more guests

2106
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And etc.

2107
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Alright

2108
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news

2109
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Believe it or not, some things did happen

2110
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And we'll get into that

2111
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And then we'll get into Twitter topics after the news

2112
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Let those last few tweets come in on Twitter

2113
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
So let's do rapid fire first

2114
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Well, we talked about in part A

2115
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
How we've missed a lot of games that have been coming out

2116
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well, I know for a fact

2117
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
That I've missed a ton of stuff that's come out on

2118
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Xbox Live Indie Games

2119
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And here's a few games you may want to check out

2120
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
First we've got

2121
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Office Politics

2122
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Which is the game you can have for the

2123
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Large sum of 80 Microsoft Points

2124
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Or $1

2125
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And it's basically kind of an Office sim

2126
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I guess

2127
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Not really like

2128
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I think Sony was pitching something like that

2129
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Rat Race that was supposed to be like a comedy

2130
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
But this is very

2131
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Sims-ish

2132
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You have to manage both like

2133
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Your hunger

2134
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And how tired you are and that kind of stuff

2135
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
So you can take power naps

2136
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And wonder where people are

2137
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
How much you sneak on the internet?

2138
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yep, all that fun stuff

2139
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So check that out

2140
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Ceiling Cat is watching you

2141
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Available for $1, that's a great price

2142
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
There's another game, Battle Beat

2143
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It's a

2144
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Looks like almost a defense game

2145
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Very similar to say

2146
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Oh, I don't know

2147
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Like a tower defense game?

2148
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Like the Crystal Bears?

2149
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Not so much like that

2150
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It gets a little bit like a tower defense game

2151
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
A little bit like Plants vs. Zombies

2152
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But you attack

2153
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And play the game with

2154
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Kind of like a beat

2155
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
A little bit mixed with

2156
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
A matching

2157
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Music game or something like that

2158
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So it's kind of neat, kind of fun

2159
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
But since it's an indie game, don't expect any licenses

2160
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's all kind of original beats

2161
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So it's pretty cool

2162
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It's a strategy game

2163
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So check that out, Battle Beat

2164
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
That's also on Xbox Indie Games

2165
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And then finally the best one

2166
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
The funniest one I think

2167
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Is Gerbil Physics

2168
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And this is also on Xbox

2169
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh god

2170
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And it's these gerbils

2171
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Like in little blocks and stuff

2172
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And they make funny faces

2173
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
When you stick bombs next to them

2174
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Also a dollar

2175
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
When you stick bombs next to them

2176
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You explode the gerbils

2177
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yes, it's a little bit like Boom Block

2178
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's sad

2179
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And it's just funny though

2180
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Hold on, is that a YouTube you're looking at there?

2181
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Yes it is

2182
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I know this is terrible radio

2183
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Looking at YouTubes, but I need to see

2184
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
What this is all about

2185
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And maybe we'll hear some hideous noises

2186
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Through on

2187
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And

2188
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So there's all these little gerbils

2189
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Trapped in little blocks or something

2190
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You put bombs by them

2191
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
They'll show the bombs in just a sec

2192
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I don't know really

2193
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But look at how their eyes get all big

2194
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And stuff like that

2195
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
They look like gerbils trapped in blocks

2196
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Like how Superman's parents were trapped in the big mirror

2197
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
At the beginning

2198
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It wasn't his parents

2199
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It was the three in the negatives

2200
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Whatever

2201
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Whoever the hell they were at the beginning of Superman

2202
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
You will kneel before Zod

2203
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
The people

2204
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Oh yeah, that's right

2205
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Because they were the people that ended up being the villains in the second movie

2206
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Whatever

2207
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's what these gerbils look like

2208
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
They look like they're trapped in the magic mirror

2209
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's funny

2210
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So yes

2211
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You have gerbils and you're supposed to be

2212
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I think knocking them below a line

2213
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And it's cute

2214
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And you don't really injure them

2215
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But they get scared because they're being flung across the screen

2216
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And you're detonating bombs next to them

2217
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But hey, a dollar

2218
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Once again, one dollar, twenty-four levels

2219
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So I mean, that's a great price

2220
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Amaze Satsuma

2221
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
In our chatroom at chat.org.com

2222
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Thinks this might have been brought to us by PETA

2223
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
People Exploding Tasty Animals

2224
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
That was from the chat, not from me

2225
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Views and opinions do not necessarily reflect

2226
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You laughed, you're going to hell too

2227
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I did laugh

2228
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Other things not related to Xbox Indie Games

2229
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Coming to the Wii

2230
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And this is talking about a

2231
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Blast from the past

2232
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Fast Draw Showdown

2233
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Looks like something that could be straight out of

2234
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Mad Dog McCree

2235
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And basically, kind of is

2236
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It's actually coming from Digital Leisure

2237
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Which I believe did Mad Dog McCree

2238
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Or at least published it at one time

2239
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And they're kind of known for some of the

2240
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
You know, full motion

2241
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Video games

2242
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But this is like a Fast Draw game

2243
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Using the Wii Remote as like your gun

2244
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But you've got of course full motion video

2245
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Of cheesy people dressed up like cowboys

2246
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
From the 80's

2247
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And uh

2248
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Back when they made laserdisc games for the sake of

2249
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Making laserdisc games and nothing more

2250
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Pretty much, yeah

2251
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Some of those games were pretty terrible

2252
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
CD-ROM games, like remember when CD-ROMs

2253
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Were new on the computer?

2254
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And they made some shittacious

2255
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And I'm making up a new word there

2256
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Shittacious games

2257
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Just because you could have movies

2258
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Although there were some

2259
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Interesting ones in there too, like

2260
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Return to Zork I think was one of those games

2261
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I miss Mega Race, didn't it have Don Knots in it or something?

2262
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Fucking Don Knots

2263
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I don't know, I think it did

2264
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Didn't really play Mega Race

2265
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That was more your thing

2266
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I think that game is on GameTap

2267
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
But that's back when I was using GameTap

2268
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
When it was cooler

2269
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I can't say it's there now, I don't know

2270
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It was one of those games that

2271
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Really needed a two speed CD-ROM

2272
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And I had an external

2273
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Big ass

2274
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Single speed CD-ROM disc drive

2275
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
So it ran kind of slow

2276
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And then later on when I got a

2277
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Newer computer and it had like a

2278
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Was a 16 speed CD-ROM drive

2279
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Which was like lightning fast

2280
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It popped in there

2281
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And the game ran too fast

2282
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I would like to see

2283
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
The WiiWare emulate

2284
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Speaking of Shittacious

2285
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Remember the hologram games we had?

2286
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Oh yeah

2287
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
There was a western one

2288
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I think there was only two

2289
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Hologram games

2290
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I think there was a time traveling one

2291
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
They had the first levels of western

2292
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Maybe that's what I'm thinking, because I could never get past the first level

2293
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Because those games controlled like butt

2294
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yes they did

2295
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I would like to see that crap on WiiWare

2296
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
For no other reason than it fits

2297
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Well when we get to our holographic games

2298
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm sure that'll be like some of the first levels of the game

2299
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
When we get to the holodeck

2300
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I'll be able to play that game all over again

2301
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And then you can go fuck this shit

2302
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And throw it across the room because it's virtual

2303
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And you can do that

2304
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
A hitstun in our chatroom

2305
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
At chat.orangelessradio.com wants to point out

2306
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Mega Race 1 and 2

2307
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Are on GOG.com

2308
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
They run in DOSBox

2309
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Awesome

2310
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I do think that they should make an indie game called

2311
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Fuck This Shit where you throw controllers at things

2312
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And that would be funny

2313
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Especially if they're wiimotes

2314
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Because Nintendo is really trying hard

2315
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
To get away from that image of the

2316
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Wiimotes going into televisions

2317
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That would be hilarious

2318
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And this week on the

2319
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Rockband music store

2320
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I'm sorry, real quick, do you think that would get on to

2321
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Xbox Live indie games, a game called Fuck This Shit?

2322
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Well you obviously would have to

2323
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
You know, freak this stuff

2324
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Frack this

2325
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Shoot, frack this shoot

2326
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I don't know

2327
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Patent pending

2328
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Rockband this week

2329
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Of course we've talked about this for a few weeks now

2330
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Different things coming

2331
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Including the Paul McCartney download pack

2332
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Which I saw commercials for this

2333
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
They are actually advertising

2334
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Download content on

2335
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
VH1 and stuff

2336
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I was like, what?

2337
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
But it's Paul McCartney so I guess maybe that's why

2338
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Well you know, it's kind of a big deal

2339
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
When it's Paul McCartney

2340
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Three songs, I mean, come on

2341
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But yeah, they've got a

2342
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Live pack including Band on the Run, Jet

2343
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And Sing the Changes

2344
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Each of those available for two bucks

2345
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
160 Microsoft Points

2346
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Or 200 Wii Points

2347
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
We really do need to do conversion for you

2348
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
For that, and of course you save 50 cents

2349
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
If you buy them in a pack

2350
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Also coming in a three pack

2351
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Blink 182 Pack 2

2352
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Also available for $5.50 for a pack

2353
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And $1.99 each

2354
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And they include Adam's Song, First 8

2355
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And I Miss You

2356
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And then finally the individual tracks also available

2357
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
For two bucks each

2358
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
We have the Psychedelic Furs with Love My Way

2359
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And Sister Europe

2360
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
And the Ramones with Rock and Roll High School

2361
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Which

2362
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
That's pretty fun

2363
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I got linked by Hitstun in the chat room

2364
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
To an article that talks about Matt Hazard

2365
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And those games, this is an article that was running on some of the gaming blogs this week

2366
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I guess there is a

2367
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Upcoming Xbox Live

2368
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And PSN title in the series

2369
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Matt Hazard, Bloodbath, and beyond

2370
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
One of the difficulty levels is called

2371
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Fuck This Shit

2372
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Is actually the difficulty level

2373
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
So somebody did

2374
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Kind of think about it

2375
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
The game isn't called Fuck This Shit

2376
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It probably will be after you play it

2377
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Fuck This Shit

2378
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Why'd I pay for this?

2379
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Dammit

2380
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Who knows, who knows

2381
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Let's move on and talk about some other

2382
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Quick news topics this week

2383
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Loki brought up Plants vs. Zombies earlier

2384
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And I know some rumors have come up before

2385
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
About the game coming over to iPhone

2386
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Well it does sound like it is happening

2387
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It's supposed to be coming to the iPhone

2388
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And of course that means the iPod Touch as well

2389
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
January is what they're saying

2390
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That's from PopCap's Facebook page

2391
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
No word yet if

2392
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Apple's approval process will

2393
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Fuck all that shit up

2394
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
DJ David

2395
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And I always mispronounce his last name

2396
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Guetta I think is how you say it

2397
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
He had a download pack available in DJ Hero

2398
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
You can play some of the songs

2399
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And the odd thing about it is that

2400
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
It's some of the rare songs in the games

2401
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
That aren't mixed with anything

2402
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
They're remixes of those songs

2403
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
They're not mashups

2404
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
There's very very few songs in DJ Hero

2405
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Like that but all those track packs

2406
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I want to go back and play that

2407
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I actually downloaded it and never played it

2408
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Did you know the very last song in the game

2409
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I don't think this is a spoiler

2410
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
The very very last thing you unlock

2411
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Is Herbie Hancock's Rocket

2412
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
With all that insane scratching

2413
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Yeah

2414
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That's the last song that you get

2415
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And it is hell

2416
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It isn't mixed with anything because the song

2417
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Like when I first played it you know what I said

2418
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Fuck this shit that's what I said

2419
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
It's the one song in the game

2420
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I can't get more than like two stars on

2421
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
On hard

2422
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Anyhow back to David Guetta

2423
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Cause I liked his songs quite a bit that were in the download pack

2424
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Well apparently he is actually working on

2425
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
What he called the number two

2426
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Version of the game

2427
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I don't think he means the poop version

2428
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I think he actually means DJ Hero 2

2429
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Which you could read as some type of confirmation

2430
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Of a DJ Hero 2

2431
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Although I mean

2432
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
File that next to Duh and of course

2433
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
But you know it is kind of cool

2434
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
That he is involved with it

2435
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Because you know a lot of DJs

2436
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Very prevalent ones showed up in the first game

2437
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
So it's kind of cool that they're working with a different handful

2438
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Of folks for the second game

2439
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I'd like to see what kind of mashups he might produce

2440
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Cause he does some very dancy clubby type of stuff

2441
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
So that would be kind of neat

2442
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
To see what he puts together for

2443
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
DJ Hero 2

2444
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
One other quick note on a completely different note

2445
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Ogre Battle 64

2446
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I don't know if you remember this game

2447
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You might not cause I think it's one of those

2448
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Really rare games that was out

2449
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
On Nintendo 64

2450
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It is apparently making its way to the virtual

2451
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Console at some point in January

2452
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Oh for Japan anyway

2453
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But as you know

2454
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Usually these games that come out in Japan

2455
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Do make their way over here

2456
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Some other things that are coming out on the Japanese

2457
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Virtual console, Princess Tomato and

2458
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Salad Kingdom remember that game on the Nintendo

2459
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
That's coming out, Kirby's Star Stacker

2460
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And Salamander and Parodius

2461
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
For the MSX

2462
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Cause remember they get

2463
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
They get MSX over there

2464
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Which we have yet to get

2465
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Probably because those games aren't in English

2466
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
At all

2467
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
At all

2468
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Although I really wish we would get the MSX games

2469
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Cause you know what that means we could get is

2470
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Guardic

2471
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
That's right the game that the Guardian Legend was technically a sequel to

2472
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Dark Stacker what do you got for us?

2473
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Some stuff

2474
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
We actually have

2475
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
A new

2476
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Trademark from Sega

2477
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Let's Go Island

2478
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Which the theory

2479
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Is that it might be a sequel to

2480
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Let's Go Jungle

2481
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So

2482
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Who knows but basically

2483
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
The way that Let's Go Jungle was

2484
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
You had guns

2485
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And you shot your way through the jungle

2486
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
It was

2487
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Though it's a potential though that

2488
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
This is going to be one for the Wii

2489
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So it could be who knows

2490
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Also

2491
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Microsoft wants avatars

2492
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
To reflect

2493
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Actual physical characteristics

2494
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
They've

2495
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Put out a patent

2496
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Application for

2497
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Avatar individualized by

2498
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Physical characteristics

2499
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
So they want to

2500
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Eliminate the artificial look

2501
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And make it look like someone actually

2502
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Really looks

2503
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm not really sure

2504
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
How they're going to pull that up

2505
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
But they're basically saying that

2506
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
They want to have a bit more reality

2507
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
In the game

2508
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And actually be able to portray people

2509
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Accurately

2510
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And that

2511
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
They're basically going to be pulling like

2512
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Actual health data

2513
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And you can spend points on it

2514
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Yeah there's some controversy behind this

2515
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Because I seem to remember hearing somewhere

2516
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
That this ties into

2517
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Like

2518
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Hey fatty stop playing the game basically

2519
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Like that could be the next

2520
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Development which would suck

2521
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Because people should be able to do what they want

2522
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah

2523
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Well there's now

2524
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Well a pachinko game

2525
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
That is

2526
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Castlevania

2527
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It's Castlevania Pachislot

2528
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And it has a story

2529
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Where you are Trevor Belmont

2530
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Challenging Dracula

2531
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And being helped by Angela

2532
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Who's a sorceress

2533
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And it actually

2534
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
You can buy the soundtrack to the game too

2535
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It's pretty

2536
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Kinda

2537
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
There's even a video of it

2538
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That's funny

2539
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Because you know there's a Gradius pachinko

2540
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I'm kind of surprised

2541
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
This is the first Castlevania

2542
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Pachinko machine

2543
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Well there's also a Parodius one too

2544
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
That I've actually

2545
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Found a playthrough

2546
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
About

2547
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
This is pretty neat

2548
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I would be surprised if this is the first

2549
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Because keep in mind that Konami does slot machines

2550
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Is a big business area

2551
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
It's actually got pretty cool graphics

2552
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And I'm assuming it could be pachinko machines over in Japan

2553
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Because we don't really see those here

2554
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
But I have seen Konami slot machines here in the US

2555
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
This is actually pretty hot

2556
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Nice

2557
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Why can't they actually do a good game like this?

2558
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
That's what I was thinking

2559
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
That looks better than a lot of the games that have come out recently

2560
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Like Judgment?

2561
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah

2562
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Let's go to the Twitter

2563
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
You know Judgment would have been really good

2564
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
On the Playstation 1

2565
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Let's go to the Twitter

2566
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And look at some Twitter topics tonight from you guys

2567
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
The listeners, you guys have sent us a few things tonight

2568
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Let's start it off with Blue Swim wants to know

2569
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
What game or franchise do you think

2570
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Will be each system's biggest selling title

2571
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
In Holiday 2010

2572
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
This is really hard, dude

2573
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Because a lot of these games

2574
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
We don't know about yet

2575
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Because E3 is kind of when the Holiday lineups are announced

2576
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So these are really shots in the dark

2577
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I would say probably the biggest seller

2578
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Out of any of them is gonna be

2579
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I think Nintendo's gonna unveil the new Zelda

2580
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
This year's E3 and that'll probably be the big one

2581
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Because Wii's got the biggest market

2582
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You know, clutch right now

2583
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Otherwise, if there's

2584
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Some type of new Call of Duty game next year

2585
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I'm sure that will take the crown too

2586
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
No, because if it's the actual trend

2587
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's gonna be not the Infinity Ward game

2588
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But it's gonna be the other one

2589
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Forget the other company

2590
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Not the Infinity Ward here

2591
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Alright, fine

2592
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
But I think Zelda will also be a big one

2593
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So

2594
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I don't think it has to be necessarily

2595
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
First party either

2596
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I think when we bring up these third party activisions

2597
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And so forth

2598
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And it's kind of on multiple systems

2599
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Because Modern Warfare was probably the biggest seller, right?

2600
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yeah

2601
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
This year, and that was on multiple systems

2602
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Let's see

2603
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Going to

2604
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
VonToxic on Twitter says

2605
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
If Tinker isn't on your news list

2606
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
You should mention it

2607
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It's free on Games for Windows Live

2608
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And it has achievements

2609
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I don't know if VonToxic might have something to do with this game

2610
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
But hey, I'm off for free

2611
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And yeah, that's Windows' new games on demand thing

2612
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
You know, kind of like their Steam competitor type thing

2613
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Hey, Steam

2614
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Do these achievement points

2615
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Steam

2616
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Kind of blend together with my achievement points on Xbox Live

2617
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I doubt they do

2618
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Because I don't think the PC like Halo 2 had them

2619
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And I don't think they blended

2620
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Well, Grand Theft Auto 4 does

2621
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
They have achievements

2622
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And

2623
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I'm not sure

2624
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I know it shows up when I play Grand Theft Auto 4

2625
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And it's kind of pathetic

2626
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Because Grand Theft Auto 4 has no protections on it

2627
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Well, it had minimal protections on it

2628
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So you could cheat really easy

2629
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And all of that stuff

2630
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Well, it looks kind of like a puzzle-y type of game

2631
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It uses this little kind of isometric

2632
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It looks like

2633
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Is this like some type of reincarnation of Devil's Dice?

2634
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Because I noticed it uses dice

2635
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
In kind of an isometric playing field there

2636
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So I don't know, I'll have to download this myself

2637
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And check it out, I'm off for free

2638
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But I like some of these achievement names

2639
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Like SmackMySwitchUp

2640
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Switch1, Switch2, Switch3, Profit

2641
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
So whatever that means, that's 10 achievement points right there

2642
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It's got to be more than Devil's Dice

2643
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Because I see dominoes, I see little targets

2644
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
This is clearly some type of

2645
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Like a little puzzle game

2646
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Based off toys you would find in a kids room

2647
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But that's Tinkr

2648
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And I'm all for free

2649
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So I'll have to check that out for next week

2650
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Let's see

2651
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Tigerclaw sent us a list of

2652
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Xbox Live games for mobile phones

2653
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I guess that's something being looked at

2654
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Let's see

2655
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
He's linking us to an article from

2656
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
MTV's multiplayer blog

2657
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Saying that Microsoft wants to do more

2658
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Between Xbox Live and Windows Mobile enabled devices

2659
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Of course, anything to

2660
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Nickel and dime at the iPhone

2661
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And kind of get back at them for that

2662
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Talking about avatars on the phones

2663
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Being able to do Xbox Live

2664
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Social media

2665
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Multi-screen experiences

2666
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
They're hiring what's called a principal program manager

2667
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
That's going to drive the platform

2668
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And bring Xbox Live enabled games

2669
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
To Windows Mobile

2670
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
You know when I hear this

2671
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I kind of think about the whole

2672
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Remember the Fable pub games

2673
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
That tied into Fable 2

2674
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I could see something like that happening with this

2675
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
You have a mobile game that kind of enhances

2676
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
An existing game

2677
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
But doesn't necessarily take the place of it

2678
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
If that makes sense

2679
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Yeah

2680
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And especially if they tie it into one of their big franchises

2681
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm sure it could be quite the big thing

2682
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Marin Marvel

2683
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
A good friend of ours says

2684
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Final Fantasy 4 the after years is a fun

2685
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Bit of nostalgia

2686
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
What other series would you play an after years game for?

2687
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Me?

2688
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Final Fantasy 6

2689
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I don't know, anything else you'd like to see

2690
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Like a retro sequel

2691
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Episodic nostalgic

2692
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Tickle your nostalgia bone type of game?

2693
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
For Final Fantasy

2694
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Anything really, I mean Final Fantasy 4

2695
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
She happened to name Final Fantasy 6

2696
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But I don't think, I think we can name anything

2697
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I'd like to see a new jet

2698
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I was thinking the same thing, Dark Soccer, Chrono Trigger

2699
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
A good one

2700
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Something in that same vein

2701
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Ironically enough I don't know if it would be after years

2702
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Because Chrono Trigger was all over the map

2703
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
But that would be awesome

2704
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I would like to see a new jet moto game

2705
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
But that

2706
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Okay

2707
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It's old enough by now

2708
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Yeah, but I was thinking more like a story

2709
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Kind of base thing, but I guess anything works

2710
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Story based game

2711
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
You know, these role playing games

2712
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That never really

2713
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Got fully realized, you know

2714
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Like an actual Xenogears sequel

2715
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
A Xenos saga

2716
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Eh, not so much

2717
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Let's see

2718
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Um

2719
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I'm actually

2720
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Reading our chat room here

2721
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
On Pachinko machines

2722
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I'm looking, kind of catching up on our chat room

2723
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
chat.orensonstrategy.com

2724
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Very interesting perspective from AkumaJP

2725
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Because he lives over in Japan

2726
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And kind of gives us some perspective

2727
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I know we have a couple of folks that listen in Japan

2728
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I think that's great

2729
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
He says Pachinko in arcade is a different store here in Tokyo

2730
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Pachinko is bad because it's gambling

2731
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And Pachinko can look good because the developer cost is different

2732
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And the limit for developers is different too

2733
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So Pachinko is mostly computers

2734
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I didn't realize they separated that in Japan

2735
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The Pachinkos and arcade machines

2736
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Were kind of in different places

2737
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I mean it makes sense

2738
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
You don't have slot machines

2739
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Next to Street Fighter 4

2740
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Here in the states

2741
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
But at the same time

2742
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
We have like things that are practically like

2743
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Little kid gambling devices

2744
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
But they give you tickets

2745
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
They don't give you money, they give you tickets

2746
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And that, I mean those have taken over arcades

2747
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Sadly in the past 10 years

2748
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
These arcades have kind of been dying out

2749
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Bitters I call them

2750
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
You know something like

2751
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Hit the button when the wheel is in a certain spot

2752
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And this one little sliver will give you

2753
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
The jackpot whereas the things around

2754
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It only give you like 4 tickets

2755
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And then you trade your tickets in for crap prizes

2756
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Like that's kind of what we have instead of Pachinko

2757
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
So I don't know

2758
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Let's see also

2759
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
On the Twitter

2760
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Dan Shadow asks, what do you think of Bayonetta's sexiness?

2761
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Is the one handed mode too much?

2762
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Is there really a one handed mode or is that a joke?

2763
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
It's a one button mode

2764
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Oh I see

2765
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And

2766
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I don't think she's that sexy

2767
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
In the game, it's more of just kicking ass

2768
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
All the time and so it's so over the top

2769
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I think she's very sassy

2770
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
That she uses her hair as a weapon

2771
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
That's sassy

2772
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It's the glasses Rob

2773
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It's the glasses

2774
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Trust me, why do you think I'm never getting rid of mine?

2775
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I see

2776
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It's a trick

2777
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
So kind of a show tip

2778
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
From Spazinator

2779
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Wanting to know that

2780
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Hold on, it got cut off

2781
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I gotta reload the Twitter here

2782
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Live radio folks, sometimes things screw up

2783
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Cause we got some late tweets

2784
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And it threw everything off here

2785
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Spazinator says, here's an idea for an unofficial game

2786
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
While in a story

2787
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Blurt out a random, odd

2788
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And unrelated thing to say

2789
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
To see if anyone is paying attention and notices

2790
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I know you three like tangents and randomness

2791
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So here's the chance to essentially make a game of it

2792
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
As if this show doesn't get derailed enough

2793
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Doesn't that kind of already happen?

2794
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Yeah, it's called the show

2795
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I know, it's kind of what the show is based on

2796
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I mean, I like where you're going with that

2797
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But that's kind of been the longest running game

2798
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
On this show

2799
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
So there you go

2800
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Dr. Duar says, how about suggestions

2801
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
For mobile games for smartphones

2802
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Other than the iPhone, thanks

2803
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
That's a tricky one for me to answer

2804
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Because I have an iPhone, I know Dark Sakura has an iPhone

2805
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
We're sheep

2806
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Loki doesn't have an iPhone, but you don't really use a fancy phone, do you?

2807
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I hardly use my phone

2808
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Yeah, your phone's never even on

2809
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It's on all the time, actually

2810
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Is that new?

2811
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
No, it's been on forever now

2812
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
It's like for months

2813
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Oh, for months, it's not like you've done that

2814
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
For years and years

2815
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Because I remember I used to call it and you'd never be there

2816
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
That's okay

2817
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I mean, you actually use a home phone

2818
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
I don't even have a home phone, I only have my cell phone

2819
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So

2820
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Anyhow, sadly because of that

2821
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I would feel kind of ridiculous

2822
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Giving you other game recommendations when I haven't played any of them

2823
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I will have to turn to the chat

2824
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
To help us answer that one

2825
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Chat room, do you guys have any suggestions for Dr. Duar

2826
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
About what games he should be playing

2827
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
On a smartphone that's not an iPhone

2828
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Because I would be curious about that

2829
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Amiga777 in chat says, y'all got iPhones

2830
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I demand an OLR app

2831
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I would love that if I knew how to do it

2832
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Owning an iPhone does not make you a programmer of an iPhone

2833
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And I do want to point out there is an all games radio app

2834
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So you can listen to this

2835
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Usually on the drive over to the studio

2836
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I listen to the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf

2837
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Through the all games iPhone app

2838
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So that's the best we have right now

2839
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
We do have the PSP app

2840
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I will look into how to do an iPhone app

2841
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
But at the same time

2842
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I don't want to just duplicate the functionality of the all games app

2843
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I mean, that's what it's there for

2844
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
If I can think of something special

2845
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
That only could be brought from an OLR app

2846
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Then maybe, but

2847
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Don't really see the point otherwise

2848
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
But maybe you guys have some suggestions

2849
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I'm looking in chat

2850
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I see Ionotropic says

2851
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Kuglom for Blackberry

2852
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Is the game that's being recommended there

2853
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
So

2854
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Some late tweets that came in

2855
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I almost didn't read these

2856
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
But since they came in here, why not

2857
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Did you know that you can unlock a next gen

2858
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Filter in Uncharted 2

2859
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
It just makes everything browner

2860
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
What?

2861
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I hadn't heard of that

2862
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Is that just like for a look?

2863
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
It's a joke, probably saying

2864
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Because their game is so colorful and vibrant

2865
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
And all the other games are kind of brown and murky

2866
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I see, I get it now

2867
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Let's see, Ray Iannami says

2868
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
8 on the breaks DJ Max Technica machine

2869
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Now has the Platinum Crew online service

2870
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
That's a machine I haven't touched in a while

2871
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I haven't really been to Roseville Golf Land in a while

2872
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I remember they had one of those machines

2873
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I don't even know if they still do

2874
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
That's pretty broken by now

2875
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I guess there's some new songs

2876
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
And some stuff that was unlocked there

2877
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Kind of cool that there's still some arcades in America

2878
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
At least somewhere, even if you have to go all the way to New Jersey to play them

2879
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
That will do those cool little

2880
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Unlocks and online things

2881
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So apparently there was a huge line there

2882
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Let's check that out

2883
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and

2884
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Move back into some gaming news

2885
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Listless coming right up

2886
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
We have just a few more stories for you guys before we get there

2887
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Yes

2888
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Including, and this is kind of neat

2889
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
A brand new

2890
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Nintendo game

2891
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Now, I use the term new

2892
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Kind of

2893
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I don't know

2894
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Because this game

2895
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Looks exactly like Mega Man

2896
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
In fact, I would take a wild guess and say it's probably a ROM hack

2897
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Of Mega Man

2898
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
But hey, whatever

2899
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It's called Metal Kid Fortress of Peril

2900
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
It plays very similar to Mega Man

2901
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
It has the Mega Man type levels

2902
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Mega Man type gameplay, including the Mega Man type

2903
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Disappearing and reappearing blocks

2904
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Mega Man type boss battles

2905
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And some of the other things

2906
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Though, you do have an inventory system

2907
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Where you can add different abilities

2908
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Including a double jump, a floating feature

2909
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Different power-ups and whatnot

2910
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
But what's kind of cool about it though

2911
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Is it's actually getting a cartridge release

2912
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
As well

2913
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And there is a demo you can check out

2914
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That's available

2915
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I believe on the website

2916
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Retro Zone

2917
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
That

2918
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
You can play the demo

2919
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Of course, in your favorite

2920
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Nintendo emulator

2921
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
But Retro Zone, of course, if you haven't

2922
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Looked at their website

2923
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
In a while, they have wonderful things

2924
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Including reproductions of different games

2925
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Including the Nintendo World Championships

2926
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Cartridge, the Nintendo

2927
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
College Tour

2928
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Cards, they even have

2929
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Ultimate Frogger, some homebrew

2930
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Glider game, and one

2931
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
That didn't really make our show roll

2932
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But because it's a little late

2933
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
An 8-bit X-mas cartridge

2934
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Which has a little light show that actually plays

2935
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
In there as well

2936
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I heard about that, that's trippy

2937
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
That's kind of a neat little Christmas decoration

2938
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Yeah, so it's kind of neat

2939
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And the game itself

2940
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'm not sure how much it's being offered

2941
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
My guess is it's going to be probably around $40

2942
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Which is a little expensive

2943
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
But hey, you get a cartridge out of it

2944
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Personally

2945
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I don't know, it looks pretty hard

2946
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
So that might be

2947
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Beneficial for

2948
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
If you're looking for that, I guess

2949
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I don't know

2950
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
It's neat

2951
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
It's cool that there's a lot of love still

2952
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
For the old school 8-bit games and so forth

2953
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
But a ROM hack

2954
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
That's a pretty bold accusation

2955
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
You watch the video for it

2956
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I'll play you the video

2957
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
The music's unique

2958
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
But dude, you look at it

2959
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
It's totally wrong

2960
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Fast forward a little ways here in the video

2961
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
We have a lot of video tonight

2962
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Which is not smart for a radio show

2963
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
It does look very Mega Man-y

2964
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Those are the boss battles

2965
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
It's different enough

2966
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
If it's a hack, it's a damn good one

2967
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I mean, maybe they...

2968
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
But this inventory thing, that wouldn't have been in a Mega Man game

2969
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Well, you technically did have a kind of inventory

2970
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Yeah, but I don't know

2971
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I don't see this as much of a hack

2972
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Just as maybe Mega Man was an inspiration

2973
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
And maybe even some of the

2974
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Stuff comes from it

2975
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
But I don't know if I'd call it a ROM hack

2976
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It looks like a ROM hack

2977
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I guess there's only one way to tell

2978
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
There's some really good ROM hacks out there

2979
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It looks cool

2980
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
There's a ROM hack of Super Mario Brothers

2981
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
The first one that actually looks completely different

2982
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And has a lot of new features added into it

2983
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
So...

2984
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
It's very possible that this is just a ROM hack

2985
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I wouldn't be surprised

2986
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Sorry, the chat wanted the video there

2987
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So I'm linking that right there

2988
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I was having a side conversation with chat

2989
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And this just popped in my memory

2990
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Because SSJ100Matt said something about PAX East

2991
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I did just want to throw that out there

2992
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm just waiting to make sure I can go to PAX's media

2993
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
But I am planning on going

2994
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I have a couple friends who are actually going from this area

2995
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Seg, who's been on the show before

2996
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I know he's going out there

2997
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And both of us have a friend in common

2998
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
In fact, the friend that introduced us

2999
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Amanda, is planning on going

3000
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So I'm going to PAX East with a girl

3001
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Yay, I'm going to have a date

3002
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
So I am looking at making that happening

3003
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Sorry, cross the t's and dot the i's

3004
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Don't dot the t's or I won't be going

3005
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But as soon as I have all the details on that

3006
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I'll let you know, but I did promise I would try to make that work

3007
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And it looks like it's going to happen, yay

3008
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
So

3009
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Also, in news, other news

3010
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Talking about ROM hacks

3011
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Of sorts

3012
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
These are fan translations

3013
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
That I guess are at various

3014
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Types of stages right now

3015
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Fatal Frame 4

3016
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
This is a game that was not released over here

3017
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
They're doing a fan translation of it right now

3018
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
And they're talking about doing voiceovers with it

3019
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Apparently there's a fan translation that

3020
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Has translated 99% of the text

3021
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And they're going to do a patch soon

3022
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So that you can play the game, but apparently now

3023
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
They're not done, they want to start on voiceovers for the game

3024
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Of course

3025
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It's going to be by fans, so don't expect it to be

3026
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
A plus caliber stuff, but I don't know

3027
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
It might not be the half bad either

3028
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
So

3029
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I think that'll be fun to do some voiceovers in games

3030
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Sometimes though, some of them

3031
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Do a better job though

3032
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Than the pros

3033
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Yeah, that's true, that's true

3034
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Front Mission 5 is also doing a fan translation

3035
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
And guess what, it's done

3036
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Front Mission was the

3037
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
2005, there was the fifth game

3038
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That came out on the Playstation 2

3039
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And apparently

3040
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
The Front Mission series translation project

3041
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Has taken this long

3042
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Thousands of hours, 2000 pages of dialogue

3043
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
To make this game

3044
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And it is already available

3045
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And there's even a movie floating around on YouTube

3046
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Where you can actually check it out and it's been subtitled

3047
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
By the group and everything, that is freaking dedication

3048
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
You know, I remember

3049
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Many, many years ago when I was in college

3050
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I think the very, very first

3051
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Major fan translation project

3052
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
That saw fruition was Final Fantasy V

3053
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I remember when that came out

3054
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
That was a big freaking deal because it was like

3055
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Wow, somebody has

3056
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Done what, you know

3057
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Square refused to do

3058
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I remember Seiken 3, also Seiken Densetsu 3

3059
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
That was probably the next big, big one that came out

3060
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I mean there were some little games in there that didn't have a lot of text

3061
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
But yeah, then Seiken Densetsu 3 was a huge one

3062
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
They came out after that

3063
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
They even went so far as to

3064
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Translating sprites in the game

3065
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It's very interesting how far that's come though

3066
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Because you know, those are all cartridge based things

3067
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Where you hack sprites and you change

3068
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You know, some of the coding to change

3069
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
The kanji letters and the American letters and so forth

3070
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Very interesting how far that's come

3071
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
You're talking about a Playstation 2 game, that's videos and shit

3072
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
That's hardcore

3073
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
No wonder it took so long to do it

3074
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
That is a labor of love

3075
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
No, I agree

3076
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Something that the company should have just paid some people to do

3077
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But I guess they didn't want to

3078
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
One more story from Jamie, then Listless

3079
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Right, in other news

3080
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
This is for our fans of Dragon Quest

3081
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
There is a slime curling game

3082
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Ooh

3083
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Basically, it's

3084
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Going to be out on Nintendo DS

3085
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And it's basically kind of like slime bowling

3086
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
You know

3087
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Because it's got

3088
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Where you sort of guide it through different

3089
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
You know, paths and try to land in the right place

3090
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
And then you've got like a bowling mode

3091
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
It looks like

3092
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
It's just interesting

3093
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And what a timely release too

3094
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Because we have the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics coming up

3095
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Well yeah, this

3096
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Looks like it might have been influenced

3097
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I know you're all going to be glued to the tubes

3098
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
To watch curling

3099
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Exciting stuff

3100
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
That's funny

3101
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
No, actually, as much crap as I give curling

3102
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
It's actually kind of interesting

3103
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Maybe I'm just weird

3104
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
But it's kind of neat to watch

3105
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Because sometimes those WTF sports

3106
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Are kind of

3107
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I don't know, they make for good watching

3108
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I'll shut up now

3109
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Do you think you'd play that game though, the DSi game?

3110
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
No

3111
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Fine

3112
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Dark Tetsuya

3113
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
In our chatroom at chat.orangetonshooter.com

3114
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Says the OLR game could be about curling

3115
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Yeah, Dark Star

3116
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Could have the broom

3117
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Why not?

3118
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Curler hater

3119
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
That's what you are, you're a curler hater

3120
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I don't need curlers, I come with enough on my head

3121
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
We are going to

3122
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Get our friend Bobby Blackwolf

3123
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
On the program right now

3124
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Because he's going to help us with a little game tonight

3125
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
So we're going to call our good buddy Bobby

3126
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Hopefully he's standing by

3127
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
We're going to ring him up

3128
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
He's the man who hosts the show before

3129
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Here on All Games Radio

3130
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
The Bobby Blackwolf Show is live at 5 o'clock Pacific

3131
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
8 o'clock Eastern

3132
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
On Sunday nights right here at All Games Radio

3133
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Bobby, are you there?

3134
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I am, how are you guys doing?

3135
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Good, how are you Bobby?

3136
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I'm doing good

3137
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I didn't listen to your show before

3138
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Something they ought to know is that

3139
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
You always have us on your show every week

3140
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
You kind of do what you call the Daily Show

3141
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Tease, right?

3142
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yeah, exactly

3143
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Where we get to do our little

3144
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
What's Coming Up on the Colbert Rapport

3145
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Segment at the end of the Daily Show

3146
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
It's kind of like a toss over there

3147
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
You're always really good to us having us

3148
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
On the show every week, but unfortunately

3149
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
It doesn't really get to work in the reverse

3150
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Because nobody comes on after us on All Games Radio

3151
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
We rarely get to have you on

3152
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
We do read your comments from chat and so forth

3153
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
But we're glad to have you here with us tonight

3154
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
To help us with the very first list list

3155
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Of the new decade

3156
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It's very exciting

3157
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Now Bobby, for those that have never heard your show before

3158
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Since you always let us talk about

3159
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
What's Coming Up on Orange Lounge Radio and so forth

3160
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Tell us a little bit about the Bobby Blackwolf Show

3161
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
In case our listeners have not tuned in yet

3162
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
It's me rambling

3163
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
That's all you need to know

3164
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
You do a really good job selling your show

3165
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
No, it's basically

3166
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I go through some issues

3167
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Or things that are going on

3168
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
It's me talking

3169
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And reading chatroom comments for the first

3170
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
20-25 minutes and then I try to take phone calls

3171
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
From people for the last 25 minutes

3172
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And then I get to talk to you guys

3173
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It's basically my take

3174
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
On things that I want to talk about

3175
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
In the games I'm interested in

3176
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
People like listening to it

3177
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
So that's why I keep on doing it

3178
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And you do this show yourself

3179
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
The Bobby Blackwolf Show

3180
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So you don't have anybody to really banter with

3181
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
But your listeners

3182
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
And that's a tough job

3183
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I don't think people realize how difficult that is

3184
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
That means you have to read chat

3185
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
As you're trying to talk sometimes

3186
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That's tricky

3187
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Well, no, it's I let dead air happen

3188
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And then I edit that out of the podcast

3189
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Whenever I put them up

3190
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
We don't have to tell them the secret

3191
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
But your show is getting some love

3192
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
There in our chatroom from Kitsune

3193
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Yes, Bobby does a very good show

3194
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
If you get sick of the dick and fart jokes

3195
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
On our show, Bobby's a lot more serious

3196
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I should point that out

3197
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Bobby keeps it family friendly on his show

3198
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
And why would you be getting sick of the dick and fart jokes

3199
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Is what I gotta say

3200
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I'm saving them for you guys

3201
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I have no problem with them

3202
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I choose not to

3203
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
For that hour

3204
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
That's just fine

3205
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
If you want the suitable for broadcast

3206
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Video game podcast

3207
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
There's tons and tons of shows

3208
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
On the All Games Network

3209
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
And it's growing exponentially

3210
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
So check it out at allgames.com

3211
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Anyhow, you ready to play Listless tonight?

3212
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I am

3213
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Alright, let's do the music

3214
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Oh, it's been forever since we've had the music

3215
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
For Listless

3216
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Since it's been forever, I'm gonna explain real quick

3217
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
How Listless works

3218
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
We're gonna put out a topic

3219
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
And then the four of us panelists tonight

3220
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and Bobby Blackwolf

3221
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Are top three

3222
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
So four times three means we'll have a list of twelve

3223
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Then comes the tricky part

3224
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
We all go around the room

3225
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And we eliminate one thing from the list

3226
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
That takes us down to a list of eight

3227
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Which our chat room will vote on

3228
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
To come up with the definitive list

3229
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
To answer this topic

3230
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And tonight's topic is

3231
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
The thing I most want to happen in gaming

3232
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
In 2010

3233
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
This can be serious, this can be silly

3234
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
This can be lol worthy, this can be

3235
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Nobel prize worthy

3236
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Whatever you want to do

3237
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
It's up to you

3238
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
What you guys think our listeners would want represented

3239
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Is the thing most wanted in gaming

3240
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
In 2010

3241
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So Bobby, my friend, I'm gonna let you start

3242
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
You're the guest tonight, we'll let you go first

3243
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
What would be your number three thing

3244
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
You most want to happen in 2010?

3245
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Number three thing, this is my serious answer

3246
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
And you guys actually did a story on fan translations earlier

3247
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
But I want to see Mother 3 localized and released here

3248
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Legitimately

3249
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Mother 3 localized and released legitimately

3250
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
That's a damn good pick

3251
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
That's a hell of a way to start off

3252
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I think that's something folks have been looking for for a long time

3253
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
So very good

3254
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
By the way, make sure you are in our chat room

3255
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

3256
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Because it is the chatters that ultimately take that list of eight

3257
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
And break it down to a list of the top three

3258
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
What a way to start us off

3259
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
A very serious answer there

3260
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
So, Loki, we'll go to you next

3261
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
What would be your number three pick?

3262
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I don't even know if this would be good

3263
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
But I'm just gonna say it

3264
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I guess

3265
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Branthuff Auto 5

3266
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
For Project Intel

3267
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I don't even know if that would

3268
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
And is that just like

3269
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I don't even know if I want to do that

3270
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Is that just the fanboy for Grand Theft Auto

3271
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
And you mixed with the

3272
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
You just really want to be able to slap a hoe for real

3273
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Is that what it is?

3274
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
You know, that might not be good at all

3275
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I'm just thinking about that now

3276
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
That might be horrible

3277
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Do you want to quickly change it?

3278
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I want to quickly change that

3279
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Let's find something more appropriate

3280
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
For Project Intel here

3281
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I think it'd be funny to see that

3282
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Milo kid become like

3283
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
The actual child sim

3284
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
In Project Intel

3285
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Because it'd be funny to torture that kid

3286
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
So, Milo becomes sim baby?

3287
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Or what am I calling this?

3288
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Sim child

3289
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I'm so hungry

3290
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Tough, you're not real

3291
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Starve

3292
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Okay, Milo becomes sim child on Intel

3293
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Okay

3294
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Loki, did you do your homework before tonight's show?

3295
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Or are you just doing it in class?

3296
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Alright

3297
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Dark Sakura, what is your number 3 pick?

3298
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
A real Silent Hill game

3299
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Ah, so you're

3300
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
None of this homecoming garbage, huh?

3301
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
No, and even Shattered Memories isn't really

3302
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Silent Hill, it's more like

3303
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I don't want to spoil it

3304
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I see, okay so a real

3305
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Silent Hill game says Dark Sakura

3306
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Alright, my number 3 pick

3307
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Is, funny enough, extremely

3308
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Similar to what Dark Sakura picked

3309
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
But very different

3310
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
My number 3 pick is also a serious pick

3311
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I want Akira Yamaoka

3312
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Now that he's left Konami

3313
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I want him to start a development studio

3314
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
And announce a new survivor horror franchise

3315
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I mean, because obviously he can't do Silent Hill

3316
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
If Konami still has that

3317
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
But I would like to see Akira Yamaoka

3318
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Start a development studio

3319
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
And announce a new survival horror franchise

3320
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Um, Loki, is that a game you'd like to see happen?

3321
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Or what?

3322
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Um

3323
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I don't know

3324
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Maybe with the creepy bunny

3325
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
We need more games with the creepy bunny

3326
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Fine, more games with the creepy bunny

3327
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Alright, uh, Bobby

3328
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
We now have set our number 3 picks

3329
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
We're up to number 2, so what would you like to see?

3330
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Your number 2 thing you most want to see happen in gaming this year

3331
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I want to see this

3332
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And I know everybody out there

3333
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Will agree

3334
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Eye of Judgment finally sells

3335
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
1 million units

3336
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
They'd have to actually start manufacturing them again

3337
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
But, hey, he can do anything he wants

3338
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Alright

3339
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Maybe they will have a new game this year

3340
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Or something

3341
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Where the interest in the old game

3342
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Just comes back

3343
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Like Valkyria Chronicles

3344
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Took like 6 months to catch on

3345
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
So maybe this is like that

3346
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Where

3347
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
It takes 6 years to catch on

3348
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It's fine

3349
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
If it goes into best hits, Loki

3350
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Those best hits copies are going to count

3351
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Because it's still the same game

3352
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
So Eye of Judgment is very true

3353
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Alright, so we got something

3354
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
It's never going to happen because it has to sell a million copies

3355
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Well, Loki

3356
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
It's what I want, that's what it's about

3357
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
That's right, it's what we all want, dammit

3358
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
You better get your wife starting on that

3359
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Tingle outfit, that's all I'm saying

3360
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
He isn't so

3361
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Loki, fine then, what do you want as your number 2

3362
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Thing you most want to see happen this year?

3363
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
President Cat

3364
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
For Wii

3365
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Amen to that, President Cat localization

3366
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Finally announced for the Wii

3367
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
That's something we've been bitching about for months and months

3368
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Bobby, you weren't even here when that happened

3369
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Think of the merchandise

3370
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I mean, the merchandising alone

3371
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
You'd make a killing

3372
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I hope, I hope by some act of

3373
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I don't know what

3374
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Seriously, think about it

3375
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Look at like, um, like Invader Zim

3376
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Off TV, but they sell merchandise

3377
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Out the ass, it's just like

3378
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Crazy

3379
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Can I just point this out, I hope by some act of

3380
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I don't know what, we get invited

3381
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
In Nintendo's press conference at E3 this year

3382
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And somehow through another act of

3383
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I don't know what, lol, haha

3384
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That is actually announced by Reggie

3385
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
On stage, listen carefully

3386
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
For the cackling from the audience

3387
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Because it'll be me

3388
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Losing my shit

3389
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
In the audience, just so you know

3390
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Okay, Dark Sakura

3391
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
If we got invited by Nintendo

3392
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
To present President Cat coming to America

3393
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
On stage with Reggie

3394
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I would be there with a Tingle costume on

3395
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
It would never happen

3396
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on

3397
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Hold on, stop the music, stop it

3398
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Stop it right now

3399
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Did I just hear you correctly?

3400
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Yes, because it will never happen

3401
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
There is a back door to winning the Tingle bet

3402
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Apparently, I know, I'm happy about this

3403
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I know, I'm just, there is a back door now

3404
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
If we get invited by Nintendo

3405
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
To announce President Cat on stage

3406
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Loki will do it in a Tingle costume

3407
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
What that has to do with President Cat

3408
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I don't fucking know

3409
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
But this now has to happen

3410
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
It will never happen

3411
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
They used GPD for some of their other stuff

3412
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
At previous press conferences

3413
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
It could happen

3414
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I will shave my head and tan a lot

3415
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And I'll look like GPD

3416
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
If that's what it takes

3417
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Okay, back to the music

3418
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Dark Sakura, your number two pick for me

3419
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Trauma, Trauma

3420
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Oh, okay, so by proxy

3421
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
That's okay, it's your list, do what you want with it

3422
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Keytar Hero

3423
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
With a Q?

3424
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
No, it's

3425
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
The keytar

3426
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
The keyboard

3427
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Oh, okay, got it, got it

3428
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Yeah

3429
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
And who would be the featured artist in Keytar Hero?

3430
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Elton John

3431
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Alright, fine, Keytar Hero

3432
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Alright

3433
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
That's the number two thing

3434
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I would like to see happen

3435
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Actually, funny enough, it has to do with Nintendo at E3

3436
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
The number two thing I would like to see happen this year

3437
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Is I want Reggie to apologize

3438
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
At E3

3439
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And then for effect, punch a kid in the face

3440
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Yes

3441
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Just to show that they are not about

3442
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
The kids anymore

3443
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Reggie's gonna come out on stage and say, I am sorry

3444
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
That we've lost our focus

3445
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And then to prove it, he's gonna punch

3446
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
A kid in the face

3447
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
That's the number two thing I want to see happen this year

3448
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Wouldn't you like to see that happen, Loki?

3449
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Sure

3450
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I guess

3451
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
What a weird

3452
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
The face!

3453
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Yes, and actually

3454
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I'm not gonna put this on the list

3455
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
But Loki could punch the child

3456
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
In his tingle outfit

3457
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Hey, I would be down with it

3458
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I know you would be

3459
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Alright

3460
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
So, so far, just to let you know

3461
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Where we're at in case you're just joining us

3462
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
The list so far, thing we most want to see in 2010

3463
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Mother 3 localized and released

3464
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Milo becomes sim child on Natal

3465
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
A real Silent Hill game

3466
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Akira Yamaoka starts his studio

3467
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Does a new horror game

3468
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Eye of Judgment sells one million copies

3469
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
President Kat for the Wii

3470
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Keytar Hero

3471
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
And Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face

3472
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Alright, so now this is it

3473
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
The number one thing you want to see happen

3474
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
In gaming this year

3475
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Bobby, what is it? Number one

3476
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Game companies everywhere

3477
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Realize that first person shooters

3478
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Are oversaturating the market

3479
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And begin to turn all those franchises

3480
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Into dating sims

3481
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I approve

3482
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
That's a good one

3483
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I'm gonna have to shorten that

3484
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
So I'm gonna put first person shooters

3485
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Turned into dating sims

3486
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
But you all know what Bobby means

3487
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
What would be at the top of your list

3488
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
For that?

3489
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Well, some about the

3490
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Pink Spartan in Halo

3491
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Romancing her

3492
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I see, okay, so first person shooters

3493
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Turned into dating sims, I like that

3494
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Alright, number one answer

3495
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Loki, what would be your number one answer?

3496
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I don't really have anything

3497
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
That I could go with

3498
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I guess

3499
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I didn't do my homework

3500
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
So

3501
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
They do yell things in chat

3502
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
But I'm not reading chat

3503
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Holodeck

3504
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
No, that's never gonna happen

3505
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Gaming gets closer and closer to the holodeck

3506
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
But it's like the limit

3507
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
You get close to one, but you never reach

3508
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
One, that's what it is

3509
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Yeah, okay

3510
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Let's see, something I wish

3511
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Would happen

3512
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I hope

3513
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Sony has another press conference

3514
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
That sparks a bunch of

3515
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Wonderful memes again

3516
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Like Ridge Racer, in fact, I hope they have

3517
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
A giant enemy crab come out on stage

3518
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
To announce a game for Sony

3519
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
You know, the beat in on the joke

3520
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Or their next concert will be shaped like a giant enemy crab

3521
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
That'd be funny

3522
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Okay, since you need to pick one thing, I'm gonna say

3523
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference

3524
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Like actually comes out on stage and presents something

3525
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
In a tuxedo

3526
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I'm not writing that

3527
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
But you'll just know it's there, fine

3528
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Alright, Dark Sakura

3529
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
It's your turn

3530
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
What's the Uno thing you most want to happen in gaming

3531
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
In 2010?

3532
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Half Life 2 Episode 3

3533
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
With the portal gun

3534
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
About fucking time, huh

3535
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Well, it's supposed to come out anyway

3536
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
But I want the portal gun in it

3537
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Alright, a somewhat serious one

3538
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Folks have been looking for this for a long time

3539
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Half Life 2 and Episode 3

3540
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Dude, they're gonna have the Borealis in it

3541
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Which is the Aperture ship

3542
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Where's my portal gun?

3543
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
They should just have a mashup game

3544
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
With the different Valve franchises together

3545
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Like you hit the portal gun with zombies

3546
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
And you know, the Team Fortress 2 guys

3547
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Garry's Mod

3548
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
That'd be awesome

3549
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
But if Bobby's thing stays too

3550
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Then Half Life 2 will become a dating sim

3551
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So I'm not sure, with the portal gun

3552
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So I'm not sure how that's gonna work

3553
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
But it's gonna be funny

3554
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
This date sucks

3555
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Quick exit

3556
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I like where this is going

3557
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Be going

3558
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Okay, my number one thing

3559
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I have somewhat a controversial answer

3560
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
But man, I would just

3561
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
This would just make me so happy

3562
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Like, I would just

3563
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I would cry tears of joy

3564
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Would you pee with happiness?

3565
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Maybe, but you know, in the toilet

3566
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Cause that's dirty otherwise

3567
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I would just be so happy if this would actually happen

3568
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
The number one thing I would most like to see happen

3569
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
In gaming in 2010

3570
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Is X-Play gets cancelled

3571
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Thank you very much

3572
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
That would be sweet

3573
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Not that bad

3574
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I was gonna say that G4 gets cancelled altogether

3575
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
And replaced with a Seacrest network

3576
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
But I'm just-

3577
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I have to feel sorry for X-Play

3578
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Because they were part of Tech TV at one time

3579
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And so I hate to see the last bit of good

3580
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
You know, Tech TV

3581
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Die off

3582
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
But

3583
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I just have to admit

3584
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'm just done with the reviews

3585
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I'd like to see him return to

3586
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Say a out of ten

3587
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Scale instead of out of five

3588
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I give Sky's answer

3589
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Three out of five

3590
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Very nice

3591
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Bobby, I've copy pasted the list for you there

3592
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Now is the hard part

3593
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
This is the part where we're gonna go around and eliminate things from the list

3594
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
No hard feelings everyone

3595
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
This is just a part of the process

3596
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Okay, so let me again recap

3597
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
The twelve items on our list

3598
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
That the chatters will soon vote on

3599
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
As we reduce this to eight

3600
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Mother 3 localized and released

3601
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Milo becomes Sim Child on Atoll

3602
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
A real Silent Hill game

3603
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Akira Yomoka starts the studio and does a new horror game

3604
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Eye of Judgment sells one million copies

3605
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
President Kat on the Wii

3606
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Ki-tar Hero

3607
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face

3608
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
First person shooters turn into dating sims

3609
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference

3610
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
And X-Play gets cancelled

3611
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Bobby, unfortunately it's part of the game

3612
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
One of these has to go

3613
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

3614
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Just because I'm not into those games

3615
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
The Silent Hill thing's gotta go

3616
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
The real Silent Hill game?

3617
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Yep

3618
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Alright, so sadly Bobby has said

3619
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Nah, I'm done with Silent Hill

3620
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
A real Silent Hill game has been eliminated from the list

3621
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Alright

3622
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

3623
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
The Eye of Judgment sells a million copies

3624
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
It's never gonna happen

3625
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Ever

3626
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Get over it already?

3627
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Ah, sorry Bobby

3628
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
You know what, for what it's worth Bobby

3629
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I really like that answer, that was good

3630
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Alright, but unfortunately Loki has deemed it unworthy of the list

3631
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
And therefore it is gone

3632
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Dark Sakura, which of these

3633
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Is not worthy of the list?

3634
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
First person shooters turn into dating sims

3635
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Oh

3636
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Why don't we bring Bobby on the show

3637
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
If we're just gonna eliminate all his answers

3638
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Because

3639
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Dating sims are

3640
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
All you have to do is just go to Japan

3641
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Everything's a dating sim

3642
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Poor Bobby, I'm sorry Bobby

3643
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
For what it's worth Bobby, I'm gonna leave your last one on there

3644
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Cause I liked it

3645
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
The one I am gonna eliminate though

3646
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
The one that I think is not worthy of the list

3647
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Milo becomes sim child on Natal

3648
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Because I don't even think Loki knew what that answer was

3649
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
So that's the one I'm eliminating from the list

3650
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Just a way to torture

3651
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
That virtual kid

3652
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Which actually if I think about it

3653
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I'm sure they're included in some sort of

3654
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Fable game and I'll do just the same

3655
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
In that, so

3656
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Alright, here it is

3657
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
The eight that the chat room does get to vote on

3658
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Remember chatters, when you vote

3659
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Damn, I should have said Peter Molyneaux jumps into a volcano

3660
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
That would have been better

3661
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
See, I wouldn't have eliminated that

3662
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Alright, here it is though, these are the list

3663
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
As it stands

3664
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Mother 3 localized and released

3665
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Akira Yamaoka starts a studio

3666
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And does a new horror game

3667
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
President Kat is on the Wii

3668
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Ki-tar hero

3669
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face

3670
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference

3671
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Half Life 2 Episode 3

3672
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Is finally released with a portal gun

3673
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
And X-Play gets cancelled

3674
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
To vote, send a private message to Sky

3675
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
With your number one

3676
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And your number two answer

3677
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
If you don't label what's one and two

3678
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I'm going to just assume the first one

3679
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Is your number one choice

3680
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So place your vote now

3681
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And we will tell you what the top two

3682
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Sorry, top three were

3683
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
A little later in the show

3684
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And no, Bobby, stop telling the chatters

3685
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
To add Dating Sims

3686
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
That's just the way the game works

3687
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
It's no longer on the list

3688
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
But nothing

3689
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Bobby, thank you so much though

3690
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
For playing the list tonight

3691
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I think the Mother 3 one especially

3692
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Was a good one that I completely forgot about

3693
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I am behind that too

3694
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Isn't it funny your serious answer

3695
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Was the one that gets through

3696
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Bobby, any other quick plugs for what's going on

3697
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
In your life, you do another show

3698
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
On Friday nights, tell us about that real quick

3699
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Before I let you go

3700
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
It's called Friday Night Gaming, it's an actual video show

3701
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
In the sense that we actually

3702
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Have three cameras, we do it from

3703
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
An independent game store

3704
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Here in the Atlanta area and we basically

3705
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Play a game

3706
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
We live on the air, we stream it out

3707
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Sometimes we'll even play it online

3708
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I think this week we're going to be doing Bayonetta

3709
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
As our welcome back in 2010

3710
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
It's an audio podcast

3711
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
But it doesn't really work as well

3712
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Because it's very video heavy

3713
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
But we do it over on Ustream for three hours on Friday nights

3714
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Fnglive.net

3715
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
We also take phone calls

3716
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
We have the chat room

3717
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
It's basically an extension of what I do on Sundays

3718
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
But a little bit more free form

3719
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
And there are dick and fart jokes in it

3720
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
On a Friday night, so very good

3721
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And you get a whole weekend because then on Saturday night

3722
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
They do a lot of dick and fart jokes too

3723
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
So you can get it all through your weekend

3724
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Excellent

3725
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Well, Bobby, thank you so much for joining us tonight

3726
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Best of luck with your shows

3727
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
And we'll let you know what happens with the list

3728
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Alright, thank you

3729
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Dating sims for everyone

3730
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Alright, take care Bobby

3731
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Maybe in 2011

3732
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Alright, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf

3733
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Who hosts his own show

3734
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Right before us here on

3735
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
All Games Radio

3736
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
That's about going to take us to calls

3737
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
And so forth, but not until

3738
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
We do a very important

3739
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Segment of our show while I tally up

3740
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
The listless votes

3741
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
It's the part of the show where you guys

3742
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Send us emails and we pick a few

3743
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Of our favorites and read them for you guys

3744
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
It's the mailbag segment

3745
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Dark Sakura

3746
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
What kind of emails do we have this week?

3747
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Just one

3748
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
One good one I hope

3749
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Well, we shall see if it's good

3750
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Just going to take me a moment to get it

3751
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Pulled up

3752
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
That's all

3753
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
It is

3754
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I'll just start from the beginning

3755
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Dear gamers and OLR crew

3756
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I'm not going to read the beginning of this

3757
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
You were right about the 360

3758
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
It is gaming heaven

3759
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I've never been this immersed in a game

3760
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Since Pokemon Gold on a 15 hour

3761
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Road trip with constant grinding

3762
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Level 100

3763
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
The three days before I went to the store

3764
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I was constantly switching games on my PSP

3765
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Since I decided to kick the Wii out of the

3766
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Gaming cave

3767
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I was switching between GTA and Rainbow Six Vegas

3768
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
And Final Fantasy 6

3769
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I finally went to the store

3770
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
A local chain called Gamers

3771
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
To get the used Xbox 360 Pro

3772
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
With a 20 GB hard drive

3773
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I knew what I was jumping into

3774
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
With the problems the system had

3775
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So I got a 2 year extended warranty

3776
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
In the name of being the MLG

3777
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Like Tom T-Squared Taylor

3778
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Whatever

3779
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I picked up Halo 3

3780
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
In the interest of getting some

3781
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Headbanging done

3782
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
While whaling on my plastic axe

3783
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I got Guitar Hero Metallica

3784
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
With some Xbox Live Points

3785
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
A 1600 prepaid card

3786
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I've played Halo 3 for 15 days

3787
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And it was awesome

3788
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I've also played Guitar Hero Metallica

3789
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
And gotten the easy achievements all the way first

3790
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I had to fix it for a few hours

3791
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
And I'm having massive fun with this

3792
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
And my TV had no lag

3793
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And was able to set it up to 1080i

3794
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
And then I popped in

3795
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Bring It On and Death Note into the DVD drive

3796
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And it upscaled the DVD

3797
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
To 1080i resolution

3798
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
My anime has never looked so good

3799
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Thank you Microsoft for creating the Jesus Box

3800
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Now the only three things missing

3801
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
To make my purchase complete

3802
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Is a wireless adapter, 12 month gold

3803
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And a headset

3804
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
This is the eyes of President Cat

3805
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
It's purrrfect

3806
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Peace out DS Master 26

3807
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
P.S. This email is sponsored by

3808
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato

3809
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
The hottest teen stars

3810
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I wish I'd be going out with

3811
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
All three from Disney, oh by the way

3812
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Leave Miley alone and don't criticize her, she's perfect

3813
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I can't believe I just said that

3814
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I know, I'm like

3815
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Did you really just say that on air?

3816
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Bite my ass

3817
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Read the damn email

3818
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Alright, so I only like

3819
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Half heard that email because I'm

3820
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Tallying the votes, so

3821
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Are there questions for us in there or what?

3822
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I'm seeing if there's anything else in here, no

3823
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I would though

3824
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Now I need to remember what type of

3825
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Headset that we have

3826
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Because Dan has these cool

3827
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Like I could sit next to him

3828
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And not hear the Xbox at all headphones

3829
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
They're amazing

3830
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
They help me sleep at night

3831
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
It's the best present he's ever gotten me

3832
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Well technically it's the best present he's ever

3833
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Bought in himself for me

3834
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I do have though

3835
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
A little story I could throw in the interim

3836
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Sure, but let me just quickly say

3837
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Last call for listless votes

3838
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
You guys have one minute to get your listless votes in

3839
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Or they will not be counted, one minute for listless votes

3840
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Very heavy participation tonight

3841
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
We're gonna have a good list tonight

3842
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Well, what was going on is

3843
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Basically these

3844
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Geeks

3845
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Team Osaka, from the University of Osaka

3846
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Submitted

3847
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
To the

3848
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
2009 internationally genetically engineered

3849
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Machine competition

3850
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
These

3851
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Engineered bacteria

3852
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
That produce fluorescent proteins

3853
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
And

3854
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Crotonoid pigments

3855
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
To make art out of them

3856
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
And they made one

3857
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Look like Mario

3858
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
They were calling them

3859
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Biobricks

3860
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
So uh

3861
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
There's a picture of Mario

3862
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Made out of bacteria

3863
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
It's bacteria

3864
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
That's freaky

3865
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Genetically engineered bacteria

3866
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room

3867
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I make genetically engineered

3868
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Next gen

3869
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Biobricks

3870
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
They're kinda murky and brown though

3871
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Stop being gross

3872
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Alright, we're gonna get to the FUs of the week in just a moment here

3873
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
But I was just putting the final touches there

3874
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
On tonight's listless

3875
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Ooh, damn it

3876
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Right after I get them all tallied up

3877
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
One more freaking vote comes in

3878
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Damn you!

3879
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Ok, so that's uh

3880
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Live radio folks, what can you do?

3881
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
That's another vote for the number one answer

3882
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
So that's not really gonna change things too much

3883
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Ah

3884
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Sorry, live radio folks

3885
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
We will get to the FUs in just a minute

3886
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I posted the bacteria Mario

3887
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Alright

3888
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
We'll get to the listless results in just a moment

3889
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
But we are first gonna get to the FUs of the week

3890
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
And we actually have some angst

3891
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
To inspire our FUs of the week

3892
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
But before we can start ranting

3893
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
We need to get our ranty music

3894
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
So please, shligework, take us away

3895
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Here's something to inspire your ranting tonight

3896
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
In the gaming world

3897
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
It's another case of the media runs away

3898
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
With some idiot

3899
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Doing something with video games

3900
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
To make the media run away with games are bad

3901
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Ok?

3902
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
A nine year old boy apparently stabbed to death

3903
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
By a 25 year old friend

3904
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Over a game of Tony Hawk

3905
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
You see, Anthony

3906
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Maldonado was visiting

3907
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
His family in Harlem

3908
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And they were playing the new Playstation

3909
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And uh, the killer's name was

3910
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Alejandro Morales, the 25 year old I suppose

3911
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
The boy's family left the

3912
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Nine year old in the care of Alejandro

3913
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
During the night while they were playing the Tony Hawk

3914
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Game, and that's when he stabbed him in the chest

3915
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
The story goes on to say

3916
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
He was a friend, I can't believe this happened

3917
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Da da da, Anthony was playing on Playstation

3918
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
When his friend came in and stabbed him

3919
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
My grandson died over a video game

3920
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Um, I'm not so sure your grandson

3921
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Died over a video game, it's just that you left

3922
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Him under the care of a fucking lunatic

3923
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And to be fair, you may not have known

3924
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
He was a fucking lunatic

3925
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
That's very tragic that he ended up being a fucking lunatic

3926
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
But something tells me

3927
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
It really has nothing to do with video games

3928
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
This guy, Alejandro

3929
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Was just kind of

3930
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
A fucking lunatic

3931
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Don't say my name

3932
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Don't say my name, Alejandro

3933
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
People are disgusting

3934
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Anyhow, as if that didn't make you angry enough

3935
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
DarkSakura, what is your FU of the week?

3936
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Um

3937
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
My FU of the week is being

3938
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Really, really freaking exhausted

3939
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
For no real reason

3940
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Because, well I thought it was

3941
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Related to some of my vitamins

3942
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
But, I've taken my vitamins

3943
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And I feel, you know, still tired

3944
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
So I'm just extra exhausted

3945
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Yeah

3946
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Loki?

3947
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
FU to KFC for leaving me

3948
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
At the drive-thru window for about ten minutes

3949
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
While they

3950
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Jacked off, I assume

3951
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Because, um, then the manager

3952
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
The manager comes over and says, has anyone come and helped you?

3953
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I'm like, no, I've been sitting here for ten minutes

3954
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
He's like, oh shit, sorry

3955
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Uh, here's your food

3956
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I'm not gonna charge you for the whole thing

3957
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Oh, well how nice

3958
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Well, except I think he did, so

3959
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Whatever

3960
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
You didn't even get a free cookie for your troubles?

3961
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
No, but the chicken was good

3962
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So it is forgiven

3963
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
All is forgiven

3964
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Uh, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week

3965
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Just FU'd my car for being ghetto

3966
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
It's so ghetto

3967
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I will have a new car soon

3968
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I have to, I really don't have a choice at this point

3969
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
So I FU'd my car

3970
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
You do have a choice, Rob

3971
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
There's always a choice

3972
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I do, I do, but it's starting to get

3973
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
There is public transportation, Rob

3974
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
It's getting to borderline pathetic

3975
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I don't live in a city that has

3976
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Very good public transportation

3977
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I don't live in New York, I don't live in

3978
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
DC

3979
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I live in Sacramento

3980
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
That is really

3981
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
About it for what we had scripted

3982
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
For tonight's show

3983
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
So we're going to go ahead and turn it over to

3984
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Last minute stories right after

3985
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I tell you who won the list list tonight

3986
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Here it is, as voted by you the chatters

3987
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
The definitive, and this is it

3988
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
There is no arguing

3989
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
There is no disputing, this is the definitive list

3990
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Of what the public wants in the year 2010 in gaming

3991
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Number three

3992
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Is they want Reggie

3993
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
To apologize at E3

3994
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And then punch a kid in the face

3995
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
So we all know he means it

3996
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
It's the only way

3997
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
It's the only way, I won't believe him otherwise

3998
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Number two

3999
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
And I don't want to hear any of this

4000
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Blah blah blah, but it's a child

4001
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Blah blah blah

4002
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Just trust me, there's lots of kids out there

4003
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
You've wanted to punch in the face

4004
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Get a parent to sign off on it

4005
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Number two

4006
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
The number two thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010

4007
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Mother three

4008
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Is localized and released

4009
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
So Bobby gets the last laugh after all

4010
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
He ends up on the list there

4011
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Mother three is localized and released is the number two answer

4012
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
On our list tonight

4013
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And the number one thing you most want to see

4014
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Happen in the year 2010

4015
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
According to our chatters

4016
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
President Cat

4017
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Is finally released on the Wii

4018
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Woooo

4019
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
No surprise there, and by the way

4020
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I just want to point out it wasn't even a freaking close vote

4021
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Tonight, like usually these list lists are kind of close

4022
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
President Cat won in a landslide vote

4023
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I have a feeling though

4024
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
The chat room might be thinking

4025
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
That that means that then

4026
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
We would actually announce it at E3

4027
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And Loki would wear the tingle costume

4028
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Which technically wasn't part of the answer

4029
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
But I just really like that

4030
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
And maybe that's what they were voting number one

4031
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Does it give you the warm fuzzies?

4032
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
It does, it does, and we'll see

4033
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Hopefully this will be the year for President Cat

4034
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
100 copies my ass

4035
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
That's all I have to say

4036
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Only 100 copies sold, come on

4037
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Come on

4038
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Alright

4039
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
So there you go

4040
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
There's your definitive top three list as voted by the chatters

4041
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Bobby is still trying to dispute the dating sims thing in chat

4042
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Let it go

4043
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Let it go

4044
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Step away

4045
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Let it be

4046
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Alright now we'll do some last minute stories

4047
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
And we'll open up the Skype line

4048
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
1877 Game OLR

4049
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Challenge Radio

4050
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
We'll get to your calls right after some last minute stories

4051
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Loki

4052
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Love the procedurally generated MMO

4053
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Is starting off with some beta testing

4054
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
And that's coming to us

4055
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I guess on January 7th

4056
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Until that time I guess

4057
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Only registrants in the pay-to-play alpha test

4058
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Can log on though unfortunately

4059
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
But

4060
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
That's kind of neat though

4061
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
The game looks interesting though

4062
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Because it's all procedurally generated

4063
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
We'll get to a call, save that thought

4064
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

4065
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
It's Ray Iyanami

4066
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Hi, we're having a hard time hearing you

4067
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Make sure you're speaking loud and clear into the phone, who's this?

4068
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
It's Ray Iyanami

4069
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Much better

4070
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Ray, what's on your mind buddy?

4071
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Not much

4072
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I got my Christmas money

4073
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Like last week

4074
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
So I've been spending it on some games

4075
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Like Raiden 4 and

4076
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Jordan Masters Twinkle

4077
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
You've been playing Raiden 4 and what?

4078
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Jordan Masters Twinkle

4079
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Basically it's a

4080
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Xbox Live Indie Game

4081
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Sport of a PC game called

4082
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter

4083
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter

4084
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Interesting, what was the name of the PC game you dropped out there for a minute there?

4085
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
It's based on what?

4086
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
The original PC game

4087
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
is called Jordan Masters

4088
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
How much

4089
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
How much did it set you back?

4090
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
400 Microsoft points

4091
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
or 5 US dollars

4092
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Gotcha

4093
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
So that's what's going on in your gaming world

4094
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
You've had a chance to catch up on a lot of stuff

4095
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
over the holidays?

4096
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Yeah

4097
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I also got

4098
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Admittedly

4099
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Part of the reason I wanted to get it was because

4100
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
it doesn't have the stupid autocorrect feature

4101
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
of the newer DJMax games

4102
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
If you hit the wrong note

4103
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
it'll give you credit for the note

4104
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And I was able to log

4105
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
all the talks in it like within a few days

4106
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
and nothing too difficult

4107
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
and the charts are pretty easy

4108
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
but then again this is a game

4109
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
of characterless new players

4110
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
so I don't hold a grudge against

4111
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Pentavision for that

4112
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Now you sent us

4113
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
You tweeted us about the whole

4114
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
DJMax Technica thing going on

4115
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
What is kind of else's new in the

4116
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
DJMax world? Like are they still supporting

4117
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
that arcade game? I mean the arcade game is very different

4118
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
than the home version of the game

4119
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Have you heard of any plans

4120
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
to give that arcade experience at home

4121
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
or what?

4122
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I haven't heard anything

4123
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
and

4124
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
even if there were plans to make

4125
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
a Technica port for home

4126
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
it would be really hard considering

4127
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
the setup of the arcade game

4128
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
If you were to put on DS

4129
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
you would have to dump that

4130
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
experience in because DS can't support

4131
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
more than two fingerprints at once

4132
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Do you think

4133
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
it might work on a motion control type thing?

4134
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Like maybe if it was pointing at the screen

4135
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
like on the Wii or Natal or something

4136
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
or is that going to just change it too much?

4137
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
It'll probably change it too much

4138
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
The Wii remote would be not

4139
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
the type of stuff

4140
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
One other thing I know you're

4141
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
really into Ray is that you

4142
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
like a lot of the Japanese shmups

4143
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I know you talk a lot about those

4144
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
when you call in. Are there any exciting things

4145
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
to look forward to in 2010?

4146
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Um

4147
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Apparently

4148
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Escalita 2

4149
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
which is also a cave shooter

4150
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
is getting released soon by the

4151
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
also published in the cave and

4152
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
ported by M2, the same people behind

4153
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
the Council for the Adventure of Rebirth

4154
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
which does not allow for it to get downloaded

4155
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Out of curiosity

4156
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Do you play Ikaruga this week too?

4157
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Because it seems like everybody else did but me

4158
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I don't play Ikaruga

4159
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I haven't played it before

4160
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
but I haven't touched it in years now

4161
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I see. Fair enough

4162
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I think you would be intensely pissed off by it

4163
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Is there anything else?

4164
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Go ahead

4165
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I try to play it

4166
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
just to survive

4167
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
but then I keep hearing the robotic

4168
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
where it's going, watching, watching

4169
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
and now it's pissed me off

4170
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
remind me how bad I am at changing the game

4171
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Mmm

4172
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
It's a very frustrating game

4173
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
you really have to

4174
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
I think it's one of those ones that you have to have

4175
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
the experience of playing it so that

4176
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
you start realizing what's coming where

4177
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
and then it's more just one of those technical games

4178
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Yeah, it's like more memorization

4179
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
based than like many other shooters

4180
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
like more memorization

4181
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
based than just like scoring

4182
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
not like it's just a survival art type thing

4183
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
but

4184
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Well, art type I still think is

4185
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
a little bit less of a challenge than

4186
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Ikaruga

4187
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Okay, speaking of art type

4188
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
the art type dimensions

4189
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
on 360 can

4190
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I still refuse to play it

4191
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
because if I try to play it on my

4192
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
arcade stick

4193
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I wouldn't be able to change the controls

4194
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
since A is below X

4195
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
so I don't have to push my fingers in a rather awkward

4196
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
position just to be able to play

4197
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
because A is to fire an exit

4198
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
to use the force pod

4199
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
See, with that one I really like

4200
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
playing it with the

4201
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
regular controller

4202
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
it's actually pretty cool to me

4203
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I don't know

4204
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I forgot my

4205
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Street Fighter IV stick

4206
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I haven't played a single 360 shmup

4207
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
without it besides Omega 5

4208
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
It's kind of interesting how that

4209
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Street Fighter IV stick is really adaptable

4210
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
to lots of different games, isn't it?

4211
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Yeah

4212
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I'm

4213
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
planning on eventually

4214
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
modifying it to have a

4215
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
different kind of stick

4216
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
instead of starting with a 360 shmup

4217
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
because I heard those are

4218
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
better for shmups and other

4219
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
games

4220
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I just wish they'd release a better d-pad

4221
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
so we don't have to spend all this money on these

4222
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
fancy schmancy joysticks

4223
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
but hey, you know, whatever helps bring the experience in

4224
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Even with the d-pad

4225
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
get in your way

4226
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Alright, well Ray, we gotta let you go to get some more

4227
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
calls, but thank you as always for the call and a

4228
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
variety of topics tonight and

4229
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I hope you get all the shmups you want in 2010, okay?

4230
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Hopefully

4231
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Alright, later! Bye

4232
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
1877 Game OLR

4233
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Loki, I rudely cut you off earlier, I apologize

4234
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
but of course our listeners come first, I'm sorry

4235
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
It's alright. Serious Sam

4236
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
HD is coming to Xbox Live

4237
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
this week

4238
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
That was the other thing I was gonna say

4239
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Alright, well we got another call

4240
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
just in time. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

4241
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Hi, this is

4242
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Spaznato. Hi Spaznato, what's on

4243
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
your mind tonight, buddy?

4244
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
A couple quick things

4245
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Sure

4246
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Since you just got

4247
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
your 360 back

4248
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
there was

4249
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
one game that I

4250
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
seriously recommend

4251
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
that you at least give it a try

4252
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
It came out

4253
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
after your

4254
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
virtual 360 broke

4255
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
It said

4256
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Magic the Gathering

4257
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
dual with the

4258
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
paint walkers

4259
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Funny enough Spaznato

4260
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I had that game for one

4261
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
week before my 360

4262
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
went under. I did buy the full

4263
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
version of that game, because you know, I used to

4264
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
play Magic the Gathering back in the day

4265
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
and when I say back in the day, I mean, I was

4266
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
like 15, I was in high school

4267
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
So if you do the math

4268
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
that was like, literally half my age

4269
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
So, god, Magic's been around

4270
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
forever, hasn't it?

4271
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
But it was really hard for me to remember

4272
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
how to play, but yeah

4273
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I had a good time with it

4274
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Spaznato, were you a card game

4275
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
player? Did you play Magic as a card game?

4276
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Or was this your first exposure to it?

4277
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Oh, I played

4278
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
in high school

4279
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
just like you

4280
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
In fact, I was

4281
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
a sophomore when I started playing it

4282
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
and an

4283
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
older classmate of mine

4284
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
introduced me to the card

4285
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
game and I got hooked right

4286
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
away and I

4287
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
played it all through high school

4288
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
up until I graduated and then

4289
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
once I hit college

4290
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
and no one

4291
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
around me played Magic the

4292
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Gathering, I kind of gave it up

4293
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
But I tried to

4294
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
play season one

4295
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Magic the Gathering

4296
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
It was loosely based on

4297
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Magic, but it wasn't totally

4298
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
faithful to the card game

4299
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
But

4300
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
the Xbox Live game

4301
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
by comparison

4302
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
is damn good

4303
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Yeah, I had an old, old version

4304
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
on the PC that was released

4305
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
probably around the same time I actually played the game

4306
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Maybe by the time I was a senior in high school or so forth

4307
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
So it's been like 95, 96

4308
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
that this was actually released

4309
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
They had an old PC one that was

4310
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
pretty darn good

4311
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
It had its flaws

4312
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
It wasn't quite as...

4313
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Gosh, in playing the 360 one

4314
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I never really realized

4315
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
how many phases were in

4316
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
around

4317
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
It's just kind of one of those things that

4318
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
when you're playing the card game

4319
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
it just kind of flows

4320
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
But when you're playing the 360 one, you really see

4321
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
each phase go through

4322
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
It's a pretty complex game

4323
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
It's a pretty easy one to pick up

4324
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I happen to already have the game Spaznator

4325
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
but for those that are curious to

4326
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
pick it up

4327
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
What's the thing you like most

4328
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
about the Magic game?

4329
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Especially for someone who hasn't played the card game

4330
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
What do you think makes the game

4331
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
cool?

4332
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
It's kind of

4333
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
hard to

4334
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
really pronounce words

4335
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
but it's like

4336
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
a combination of

4337
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
getting the cards

4338
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
that you need

4339
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
when you need them

4340
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
and then actually a little bit of know-how

4341
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
and strategy

4342
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
You know

4343
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
You kind of like go

4344
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I can't think of anything

4345
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
to nail these

4346
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I mean nail these off the top of my head

4347
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
but

4348
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
what I just said before

4349
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
it's probably

4350
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
fits the best that I can come up

4351
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
with

4352
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
By the way

4353
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Let me just

4354
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
interject this real quick

4355
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
X-Link posted this in our chat room

4356
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
and this is exactly what I was looking for

4357
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
It's Magic the Gathering

4358
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
This is what always confused me

4359
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
It was also called Duels of the Plainwalkers

4360
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
It was released by Microprose in 1997

4361
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
So a little later than I thought it was

4362
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I remember that you would get

4363
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
a big oversized card that came

4364
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
in the box that I thought was kind of funny

4365
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
with the game

4366
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I totally used to use

4367
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
the candelabra

4368
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
to bring it into my regular deck

4369
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
They had

4370
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
an astral set

4371
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
a set of cards that were specifically

4372
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
in the game

4373
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Sorry

4374
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
It was a whole little game that came out many years ago

4375
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
It was still good

4376
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
It was much different

4377
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Rob, that totally reminded me

4378
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
of my other big thing of Geekery

4379
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I was using that same card to bring Captain Picard

4380
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
into my deck

4381
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
How do you do that?

4382
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It was like two combinations of cards

4383
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
where you can bring any outside card

4384
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
and put it in your graveyard

4385
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
and then another one to recycle your graveyard

4386
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
into your deck

4387
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
That is crazy

4388
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
So bring out Captain Picard

4389
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
And what would the random card do?

4390
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Did it get stats of any sort?

4391
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Well I didn't have to cast anything

4392
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
because I didn't have anything to cast

4393
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I always would say he'd rally my troops

4394
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Nice

4395
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Sorry for the bit of random and spazzinator

4396
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
What else is on your mind besides magic?

4397
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Two more

4398
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
quick hits

4399
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I know that you

4400
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
specifically aren't really too

4401
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
fortunate

4402
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
I don't know about

4403
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Dark Sakura or Loki

4404
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
or any of the other listeners

4405
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
but I happen to notice

4406
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
that over on

4407
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
the PlayStation Network

4408
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
store, specifically the

4409
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
video site, they actually

4410
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
got some sports programming

4411
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
on there like

4412
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
old NHL games

4413
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
NBA games

4414
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
NCAA football games

4415
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
a little bit of everything

4416
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
over there

4417
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I can't

4418
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
speak

4419
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
into well enough

4420
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
they got the same thing over on

4421
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
the Xbox Live

4422
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
marketplace or not, it's been a while since

4423
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I checked out the video content over there

4424
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
but if you happen to

4425
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
like watching sports and there's nothing

4426
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
good on regular TV

4427
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
you know there's always that

4428
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I just happened to recently

4429
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
buy an old

4430
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
old hockey game

4431
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
and

4432
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
the Fiesta

4433
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Bowl from 2009

4434
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
just validated

4435
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
worked pretty good

4436
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
you know and X-Link in chat

4437
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
chimes into the sports

4438
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I have to be honest, I don't

4439
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
serve the video marketplace very often because I have

4440
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Netflix and usually that kind of fills in

4441
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
my video needs

4442
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
but

4443
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
it's interesting that

4444
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
that exists

4445
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
because if you saw a really awesome

4446
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
play in a game or what have you

4447
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
that's literally content on demand

4448
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
but I don't know

4449
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
it doesn't seem like that would be very

4450
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
popular to watch a game and download it

4451
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
long after it's been played

4452
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
when you read about it on your favorite

4453
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
sports or see it on ESPN the next day

4454
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
but hey I guess if there's that one awesome play

4455
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
or something really epic happens in the game

4456
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
you can download it and watch it forever

4457
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
even though it would be on YouTube too

4458
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
yeah true

4459
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
and you know

4460
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I'm not exactly the biggest

4461
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
sports game out there

4462
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
on Far From It

4463
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
it's kind of weird because I'm from

4464
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
a sports crazy city

4465
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
but once in a great while

4466
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I do like to watch a game of

4467
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
some sort and

4468
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I figure kind of like what the hell

4469
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'll get that, there's nothing on the record

4470
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
TV

4471
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
it's kind of like

4472
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
impulse buy

4473
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
you know what if there's a buck to be made

4474
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
off of the game and if they even make

4475
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
$50 off the encoding and what have you

4476
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
they'll probably do it

4477
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
quickly what was your other thing, you said you had one other thing

4478
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
and then we gotta let you go to get more calls

4479
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
yeah

4480
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I had a relatively minor

4481
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
bone to pick

4482
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
with your number one

4483
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
pick for listless

4484
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
yeah, why is that?

4485
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
well

4486
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Bobby said

4487
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
what I was thinking

4488
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
is that

4489
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
X-Play

4490
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
is nearly as big

4491
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
a screen as not the greatest

4492
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
show there ever is

4493
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
or was, but

4494
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
not quite as bad as

4495
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Alpha People

4496
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
in fact

4497
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
that's one of those

4498
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
several searches I

4499
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
gave me news from

4500
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I think that

4501
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
is as well, but

4502
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
it isn't

4503
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
all bad

4504
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I might be

4505
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
digging up old old stuff here

4506
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
but let's not forget this is the show that thought Beatmania

4507
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
was newer than Guitar Hero

4508
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I'm just, you know

4509
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
sometimes the quality of the show

4510
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
needs a little work, obviously

4511
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I'm picking on them because I can, but

4512
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
you know

4513
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
I don't know, I think the quality of gaming

4514
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
television overall could be a little better

4515
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
if somebody would just, would just try

4516
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
alright

4517
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
quickly

4518
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I ran out of cable

4519
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
for like a year or so

4520
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
but you know, there's one

4521
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
thing I took into consideration

4522
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
when I talk to people

4523
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
alright, fair enough, alright Spaznator we gotta let you go

4524
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
but take care, and have a good one, ok?

4525
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
yep, you too

4526
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
have a good one

4527
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
and you know, I will give you guys that, it is the one remaining

4528
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
tech TV show, but you know that in itself

4529
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
is a bit of an atrocity, I mean there were so many

4530
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
good tech TV shows

4531
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
blah blah blah, this argument is

4532
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
years old, it is what it is, it ain't coming back

4533
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
this ain't the way they used to be, and that's just what we're gonna

4534
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
have to deal with

4535
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is

4536
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call

4537
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
we'll try to get at least one more call in before we close up

4538
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
shop tonight, do we have any other last minute

4539
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
stories, Loki?

4540
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
uh

4541
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
maybe

4542
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
yeah, there's new

4543
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Dragon Age Origins

4544
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
download content coming out on January 5th

4545
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
on PC and Xbox

4546
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
360, it's gonna be coming out later in

4547
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
January, on PlayStation 3

4548
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
it's the return of Ostegar

4549
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
let me get to the phones, hi you're on

4550
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4551
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
this is dsmaster26

4552
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
hey dsmaster, what's on your mind?

4553
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
not much, I've been still

4554
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
pretty pumped about

4555
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
getting a 360

4556
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
probably the best

4557
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
game system I've ever owned

4558
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
since the PS2

4559
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
run that by me again

4560
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
because you're a little quiet tonight, you're mad about

4561
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
getting a 360 or what?

4562
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
no, no, I'm happy

4563
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
about getting a 360

4564
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
did you get a 360 too?

4565
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
it was the email I read, Rob

4566
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
oh, sorry, I was telling you

4567
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
no offense, but I was

4568
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
having a really hard time reading your email because

4569
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
you don't really use punctuation

4570
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
oh, sorry

4571
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
I was kind of writing it on the quick

4572
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
have you seen that Facebook group that's

4573
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
called, um, there's a big difference

4574
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
between Let's Eat, Grandma

4575
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
and Let's Eat, Grandma

4576
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I need to join that

4577
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
because I'm actually a member of like four different

4578
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
grammar forums

4579
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
did you see the calendar I bought?

4580
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I get it, Eat, Shoots, and Leaves

4581
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
I have not

4582
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
seen that, but

4583
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
if anything, I've been playing a whole

4584
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
lot load of Halo 3

4585
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
before Reach comes out

4586
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
and I'm probably going to pick up Halo 1

4587
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
and 2 and 3 ODFT

4588
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
possibly when that comes out

4589
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
and try to

4590
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
gain up on the Halo story in a sense

4591
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
are there still lots

4592
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
of people playing Halo 3 online?

4593
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
is it still as crazy popular as like Halo 2

4594
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
is still being played online like five years after

4595
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
it was out

4596
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
yes, and there's still people playing

4597
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Halo 2 if you can believe it

4598
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I do believe it

4599
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
because some, you know, 360s are

4600
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
still expensive, there's a heck of people probably

4601
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
still on the original Xbox, although then again

4602
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
you're paying for Xbox Live

4603
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
well, well, well, whatever

4604
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
and actually apparently I read an article

4605
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
on Kotaku

4606
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
that said it's because of Halo 2

4607
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
that we have the friend cap of

4608
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
100 for the 360

4609
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
that's right, I've

4610
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
heard this come up, I think Bobby's

4611
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
discussed this on his show before, I think I've heard him talk

4612
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
about it where the whole

4613
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
friend cap of 100, Halo 2 is

4614
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
to blame because people are still playing

4615
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
that, so in order for them to break the 100 cap

4616
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
they would essentially have to disable Halo 2

4617
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
which I don't think anyone wants to happen anytime soon

4618
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
let me ask you this

4619
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
DS Master, because you're a big Halo fan

4620
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
what do you think of Halo Reach

4621
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
is on its way this year?

4622
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Are you excited for that?

4623
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Well, I'm not really a Halo fan, but I'm like

4624
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I wanted a really good

4625
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
first person shooter on a console

4626
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
and after pulling

4627
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
my troops holiday party

4628
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
for Boy Scouts, which we do every year

4629
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
like, it was so much fun

4630
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I was just like

4631
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
holy crap, I'm finally getting the hang of this

4632
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
playing a console FPS

4633
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
after playing

4634
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Quake Live for nearly a year or two

4635
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I think I've told this story on the show before

4636
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
but the very first time I ever played Halo was at a

4637
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
wedding reception and that's where I actually had

4638
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
a whole lot of fun, was shooting up

4639
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
the wedding party, I shit you not, that's

4640
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
the first time I ever played Halo

4641
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
it was a good time

4642
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
and actually our longest session was probably 2 hours

4643
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
49 minutes and 19 seconds

4644
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Good lord

4645
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Then quickly, if you

4646
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
are into first person shooters, what do you think

4647
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
about the idea of turning them all into dating sims?

4648
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Please, I mean

4649
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
it's enough of a dating sim with the girl gamers

4650
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
trying to hit up on the gamer guys

4651
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
on Xbox 5

4652
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Well, so who says it has to be a girls

4653
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
and guys thing, I mean, you can have all different types

4654
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
of dating sims and so forth

4655
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
No kidding, I mean, that is

4656
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
true, and

4657
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
clearly from shivering and what not

4658
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
it's cold in Nebraska, it sucks

4659
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
You need to get shot with a

4660
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
hug gun, I think is what needs to happen

4661
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
You need to log into Halo and somebody needs to

4662
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
shoot you with a hug gun

4663
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Alright, DS Master, I gotta let you go

4664
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your

4665
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
call and your email and so forth, you take care, okay?

4666
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Peace out, keep the good shows rocking

4667
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Peace out, hero

4668
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
We'll try, later

4669
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Alright,

4670
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

4671
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Sorry those didn't get through, but remember you can send us an email

4672
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
It's okay, I mean, there was only one in the email

4673
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
bag tonight, and then the person got through on the phone

4674
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
anyway, but we can't control it

4675
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
We don't have a call screener

4676
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
We can't afford one

4677
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Maybe in the future, we'll see

4678
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Anyhow, we're gonna start to close up

4679
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
shop here, because believe it or not, we've been on air for about

4680
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
three hours, I know it might

4681
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
not feel like that on the podcast because you do a little break

4682
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
in the middle of life, but it's still gonna be a long

4683
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
show tonight, and a good show, good

4684
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
first show of the year

4685
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Set the tone for the rest of the year, hopefully

4686
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
We'll be back to do it all again next week

4687
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I do want to ask real quick though, if there's any other last minute stories

4688
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
before we wrap it up tonight, I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki

4689
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
had anything else to throw out there, I know I don't

4690
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Loki's shaking his head no

4691
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
I found the best book, it has nothing to do with games

4692
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Well, books are important too

4693
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I found the best book that's called

4694
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Why is Daddy in a Dress?

4695
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Answering Awkward Questions with Baby Animals

4696
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
This is the best

4697
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Look, Rob

4698
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Why is Daddy in a Dress?

4699
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Okay

4700
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
And here's one of the pages

4701
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
How much for happy and wow

4702
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
You used to hate that when you were doing massage classes

4703
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Well that's why I was laughing because

4704
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
it just made me go wow

4705
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
but it's cute with little kittens

4706
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
There's one of like a little puppy

4707
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
that said, um, are you

4708
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
like, um

4709
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
like, if, why does Daddy look like

4710
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
the pool boy?

4711
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Um, I gotta read this comment

4712
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
from Marissa and I hope she doesn't mind me

4713
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
reading a private message publicly

4714
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I told her to send it to you

4715
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
She said that they were just having a discussion

4716
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
at her house about punctuation

4717
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Capitalization is important too

4718
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
because like, for instance, you might have

4719
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
you know, capitalization could change this sentence

4720
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
um, help your uncle jack off the horse

4721
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
you know, like, like, help him get off

4722
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
the horse and so forth and you know

4723
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
he's, he's, you know, old and needs assistance

4724
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
getting off the horse, or if you didn't capitalize

4725
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
that right, it might read as

4726
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
help your uncle jack off the horse

4727
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
as in

4728
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
you need samples

4729
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
for mating purposes

4730
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
or whatever

4731
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Capitalization

4732
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
and punctuation are important

4733
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
I love those little kitten postcards

4734
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
those are adorable

4735
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I don't want them. Alright, anyhow, uh

4736
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
let's go around and get everybody's

4737
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
stop giggling

4738
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

4739
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
and wrap up the show tonight

4740
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
It's another great episode of Oral R and the Cannon

4741
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

4742
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Um, hopefully

4743
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
I'll play Borderlands this week

4744
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Um, my final thought is

4745
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
um, hopefully I'll get to play

4746
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
one of the, like, 50 games

4747
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
um, that I have

4748
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
in my queue of games to play

4749
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
uh, this week, get to spend more time

4750
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
with that, but I'll probably be too busy trying to finish

4751
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Symphony of the Night and making progress in

4752
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Shadow Complex

4753
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
and eventually playing Morrowind

4754
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Too many things to do

4755
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Uh, Dark Saga, your final thought tonight?

4756
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Um, yeah

4757
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Uh, that's gonna do it. Thank you guys so much

on iTunes, we really appreciate those

4769
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
They all go a long way, you know

4770
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
we're independent radio, we don't have

4771
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
you know, a big, huge magazine or video

4772
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
game company backing up our show

4773
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
so we appreciate all the word of mouth we can get

4774
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
So that's gonna do it this week for Orange

4775
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
