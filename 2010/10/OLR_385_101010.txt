Tonight, October 10th, 2010, DC Universe Online faces a delay, OnLive gets cheaper to use, and another classic arcade game is set for revival on this gen's consoles.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
And we don't forget the episode number.
www.allgames.com.
I always forget the episode number.
It's episode 385 for those that are still counting.
The smart ass you hear over there in the corner is my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
How are you?
I'm inhaling bacon fumes and it's not kosher.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I wonder because there used to be a guy when I was working at Roundtable that would order a quadruple sausage pizza.
It literally is like a three-quarter inch thick layer of sausage that's just on top of the pizza.
For those who don't know, Roundtable is a big pizza chain.
On the West Coast, yeah.
The whole West Coast or just California?
Mostly California.
You can make it work if you did extra cheese, triple bacon.
You're right.
The problem was it was too greasy and actually the point is actually you couldn't really taste the pizza with the bacon.
This is actually really sweet because the sauce is really sweet, but it might be able to work with like two and a half times bacon.
It would work if it was on a rack.
Do you remember there was an episode probably about two years ago, maybe a year ago, where you brought all these bacon dishes to the show?
Yes.
I never thought in my life that I would ever say this is too much bacon.
The bacon scallops.
That was last year.
That was too much bacon.
Was it last year?
That was my birthday last year.
That was actually really good.
That was a lot of bacon.
But there was so much bacon left over.
Yes, there was.
And you guys left it at my house?
I would probably do just like a meat party instead.
Because seriously, bacon, even cooking it the entire day, it's not very good.
Now, steak party, that's good.
That sounds like a game that they should sell on the shelves of Target right between Blind Date and Mall Madness.
Meat party!
That totally could not be here.
I only eat meat once a month.
Well, it'll have to be on that day.
All right.
Anyhow.
Hi.
I missed you guys last week.
My aim is still improving ever so much, though.
Oh, we did fine without you, Rob.
You can just go home if you want.
Okay, bye.
No, I'm kidding.
No, well, actually, I turned on the show while I was at the airport just to make sure that you guys, like...
We're alive.
Because he didn't trust us.
Well, you never had done it before.
So I just want to make sure you didn't get into a train wreck.
You know what I mean?
And then you guys, I heard like five seconds of the show.
You guys were on the phone with Aki Ripper.
And I'm like, oh, okay.
They're already into calls.
And then after that, everything fell apart.
Did it really?
We kept losing the stream.
It's because I tuned in.
So what did I miss on last week's show?
I have not heard it yet.
And I apologize to the podcastees.
I mean, by the time they hear this, they'll be okay.
You missed Tiara.
Well, I've talked to Tiara before.
I know she's a fun gal.
I enjoy her.
But you missed her fun hosting capabilities.
Did she do the Rob role where she kept you all in check?
Made sure you were following the show role?
Did she?
Yeah.
No.
Some.
Great.
I'm sure that show was awesome.
No, I'm kidding.
I think I skipped a story once.
And then we went back and did it.
Alright, well I'm glad to hear things were good and that means I can take vacations more often It's better than the last time we tried to run the show without you Wasn't that the show where you ended up watching like a porno?
Yeah Good times, good times Well I went to Disneyland last week as you guys know and I had a good time Bitch Yeah, I'm fresh out of Space Mountain Bitch But DarkSakura and I are still trying to get the December 17th thing to work
We got to just cross the T's and dot the I's and all that stuff.
I have an annual pass again, so going back won't be a problem for me.
And I saw some of the pictures from Electronica, which started this week, and they actually have a whole little Flynn's Arcade with like 80s old school video games.
We're there.
I know, it's going to be fun.
We're going.
Good times.
Anyhow.
No one can stop us.
No one.
Except maybe the bank.
Smite!
Maybe the bank.
The bank could stop us.
Smite.
Let's start off the show.
Let's see, we've talked about food, we've talked about Disneyland.
Is there anything else we talk about on this show?
Oh yeah, video games.
Once in a while we talk about video games.
How about Rainbow Fighting Universe?
No, seriously, someone... I was at Outback last night for my one steak a month.
Quit, I quit.
I'm going back to Disneyland.
My favorite joke to do is when someone says, do you need anything else or want anything else?
I say, yeah, like a pony, please.
And she said, oh.
And the girl said, my friend Jamie always asks for a unicorn that poops rainbows.
And I was like, my name is Jamie.
And she's like, oh, wow.
My answer would be, how would you like that cooked?
I guess you had to be there.
I'm sleep deprived.
Rob brought me caffeine unprompted.
Well, because I know it puts you in a good mood and I don't want to have to deal with bitch Jamie all night.
Anyway, love hearts.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.
I see some folks in chat complaining that the podcast is not yet uploaded from last week and I swear...
I'm not doing it out of spite.
No, here's the deal.
I got super sick.
Rob got super hungover.
I missed a day at Disneyland due to being sick.
I made Alan go to the park without me on Sunday.
And I thought I was getting better come Monday, but then Tuesday, the day I was supposed to come over and get all the show stuff taken care of, I had the worst fever.
I had to call in sick to work.
And that's a big deal for me to call in sick to work because I really don't.
Rob has amazing work ethic.
He did that fantastic crib place across the street from Disneyland.
Actually, we did eat at Tony Roma's.
Yes, we did eat there, actually.
That's right.
I haven't seen him in forever.
Yeah.
So, all right.
Anyhow.
Tony Stark's House of Ribs.
Alright, I'm just reading the chat and a salacious pop is just going, wow, I was mean to Jamie, I didn't mean it, come on you guys, I have to razz around the show, I got last week to make up for, come on you guys And your mic sucks, that is not a lie You went to the place without me
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I was going to play Final Fantasy XIII and didn't.
Dan's been in there with our friend George over here playing Halo Reach all day.
And I played Star Trek Online and I'm doing... I've got actually until tomorrow to finish the other three missions and this whole Breen thing so that I can get my free Breen tactical officer.
Because I have a shit ton of homework to do the rest of the week.
So, busy Jamie is busy.
I played lots of Plants vs. Zombies I played Narbacular Drop which we know what that is, right?
The precursor to Portal.
The game that eventually became Portal.
I'm not any good at it.
It's a neat concept.
But I'm glad that Portal made it less clippy, if you know what I mean.
With fewer trolls in it.
And then, what else did I play?
Um...
Dan's played a whole lot of Mega Man.
Mega Man 4 Game Boy Edition
I think the Mega Man collection on GameCube is still an awesome game to have.
Because you know those GameCubes, you can still play them on the Wii.
So it's still a good collection to have.
Or the PS2, whatever one you want.
Some people don't like the GameCube one because they think the buttons are swapped or something.
But it's fine.
It doesn't bother me.
Either way, it's fine.
You're not bothered, Rob.
No.
And I've been keeping Super Metroid all warm and cozy for you.
I like the long stick
Oh my.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Um, it was okay.
I didn't play a whole lot.
I played mainly Grand Theft Auto.
You know, more Grand Theft Auto 4, Lost and Damned.
Still playing more multiplayer.
I am really pissing off my coworkers because I keep winning a lot.
And I've actually had to draft up a printed out form letter for apologies for beating them at certain things that I fill out.
So, um...
I don't know if that adds insult to injury or what, but it's what they requested.
I'm sorry that you suck.
It sounds like you had to make your amends to your coworkers.
It's because, okay, the game is so laggy now.
I think they shut down some servers or something when they moved on to a new expansion and Red Dead Redemption, that kind of stuff.
So the game gets a little laggy sometimes, and sometimes things just seem to go my way.
Like, um...
They'll be coming to attack me and all of a sudden a car hits them and they get knocked over and I turn around and shoot them in the face.
My big thing now that I've become fascinated with is climbing up buildings.
I'm totally this massive free runner in that damn game now.
It's ridiculous.
How the fuck did you get on top of that skyscraper?
You're Spider-Man.
Seriously, I'm like Spider-Man in that game.
It's ridiculous.
And there's a lot of places, especially in Algonquin, that you can just climb up to the top of buildings and there's so many fire escapes you can get to and it's ridiculous.
So you had to write your co-workers apology letters?
Were they at the point where, we're not playing with you again because you're a jerk?
They're getting pretty pissed off at me.
Sounds like...
What?
She's walking on sunshine.
and DarkSakura.com.
I'm sorry that I repeatedly beat your ass at Grand Theft Auto and I'm sorry you can't handle it.
Sorry you suck.
It's not necessarily... It's only when really ridiculous things happen that shouldn't happen normally in the circumstances of the game.
I don't know.
Whatever.
Other things I played other than Grand Theft Auto, I did play a little bit of Dead Rising 2.
I really do mean a little bit.
I only got to the part where...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I am digging, though, this one app on there called the Free App Tracker.
And it'll basically track or let you know when apps drop in price to free.
So you can go on there and browse through there and download games that would normally cost you money because they're either trying to promote them or whatever.
So that's kind of cool.
A great way to get a bunch of free shit.
So yeah, that's pretty much what I've been playing.
I'm excited I get a new laptop this week that I'll actually be able to run Grand Theft Auto on it so I can do my editing at work because that's really the only time I'll actually have to do mods for the Xbox 360 version.
Plus I can run other things on there.
And I'm possibly going to download Minecraft now since everybody keeps talking about it and I got to see what this thing is.
I somehow missed the boat on all this Minecraft stuff because it's just really happened in the past couple weeks.
But why is everybody all gung-ho about Minecraft?
I somehow missed this while I was on vacation.
It went free for a while while they were fixing some server issues or something.
And once people started playing, they're like, oh my god, it's addictive.
It's basically a game you go in and you create stuff.
And then there's monsters.
There's a lot of games like that, isn't there?
Well, yeah, but this is really addicting, apparently.
Okay, I'll have to try it.
I mean, don't knock until you try it.
To the point where, like, there's someone, like, recreating the Star Trek Enterprise full scale in the game.
That's cool.
So it's kind of like Lego is but a game.
Something like that.
It's like Lego Universe, but not.
Okay.
We've created a new game in the chat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and like wow people really do buy those but you know what actually um I can relate this to Disneyland a little bit um you know I do the pin trading at Disneyland and I always buy like a generic pin set to trade away to people uh to because the employees trade with you and it's this whole little like weird game you play while you're at the parks so I bought a pack of starter pins you know what the pack was that I bought of starter pins Club Penguin and
and like almost all day long people kept asking me like what are those pins what is it and I'm having to like explain Club Penguin to people which is weird because I've never played it but it's one of those like Disney style Farmville-esque MMOs and they sell those cards right next to the Farmville cards at the store but it's more for kids because it's Disney so yeah people actually buy that stuff but I mean the kids stuff I get because the kids stuff you really have to ration I get that a little more but the adult stuff it's like oh boy
Oh boy Um
Yeah, so again, if you want to join us in chat, chat.orangelandrita.com.
Anything else you want to mention about your gaming week, Loki?
Are you all done?
You all done?
I'm done.
All right.
I don't think I have a whole lot for my gaming week.
I got to be honest.
Since I was out for five days and then I was sick, I didn't do a whole lot of gaming.
Just a lot of sleeping.
I did play some more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm a big old... Yeah, shut up.
Hey, my guild is nine of 12 now in ICC, finally.
We're almost there.
Sounds like a Borg designation.
Doesn't it?
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
What's that?
Your what thing?
Breen.
What's that?
They're a race in Star Trek.
Oh, is this like a thing you have to grind a lot to get to play them?
No, no.
And I'll tell everyone right now who's playing Star Trek Online, they're having a special that if you do the Breen episodes, there's five of them, when you finish the last episode, you get a Breen tactical officer.
Only until the 14th.
Wow.
So that's what I'm doing.
Only I've got tomorrow to finish it.
Random.
Random.
I'm sorry, but now I don't feel so bad about my brain.
That's all right.
There's holiday events in WoW that are just as bad.
So yeah, it's mostly been that because I was away for five days and then I was sick and everything, so I haven't been playing a whole lot.
Plus, I spent a lot more at Disneyland than I should have, so I've been scaling back in other ways.
I was going to get the Castlevania game this week, but I've heard mixed things on it anyway.
I've heard it's not so hot.
That's the general reaction I've been seeing on Facebook.
and I actually resisted buying Final Fantasy XIV which has been getting some really mixed reviews online.
Have you seen this?
Like some websites, like I think GameSpot gave it a four.
Like...
But some websites have been giving it like eights.
So it's really hit and miss, Final Fantasy XIV.
It's interesting.
I will talk a little bit briefly then.
Some of the games I was able to play since I was at the airport and stuff, I did play quite a few iPhone games.
So just really quick, I know not everyone's into this, but I'll mention a couple things I played that came out.
Stardunk is totally free.
It's this basketball-y kind of game, but not really.
I don't want you to think it's like an NBA-type game, because it's not.
It's like...
It reminds me a little more of those old school tank shooting games.
Because you kind of use your finger to pick an angle and a power.
And then you just try to fire a ball in the basket as many times as you can.
But the ball keeps moving around the screen.
And it's like online and all this Uber stuff with it.
So it's pretty cool.
Bit Trip Beat came out on the iPhone.
This game will set you back $5.
That's a little much, I think, considering there are so many games out there that are $0.99 and free.
I talked about this last week because I actually played it last week.
Oh, did you?
What did you think?
I dislike...
I never really cared for the Wii controls.
You know how you had to tilt the remote to get your little paddle to go back and forth?
And I really don't like it on the iPod or iPhone.
I'd rather use my finger to move it up and down because that would be a lot more accurate.
But you can't, and it's annoying.
I mean, the tilt thing was fine for me.
I enjoyed it.
I still think it's a good game, and it's weird that I'll pay $10 on it on the Wii, but then I sit here and go, but $5 on the iPhone is too much.
But I think we just get accustomed to these different pricing things when there's so many games out on the iPhone that are free or $3 or less.
Your game has to be really good to justify a $5 or even $10 premium.
With Sonic 4, they want $9.99 for that, right?
Okay.
No, I am not paying that much.
But would you pay $15 for it on the PS3?
No, I wouldn't.
Oh, okay.
I wouldn't.
And why is that, Loki?
Why is that?
Why is that?
Because I've played it, and it's terrible.
Really?
Yeah, I do not like it.
I haven't played it at E3 enough.
It was fine.
Here's the thing, though.
I'm not a real big fan of Sonic games, so maybe that's not for me to judge.
Personally, I think games like Sonic Colors or the good parts of Sonic Unleashed actually seem more interesting to me.
Weird.
Weird.
And I know we'll get into stuff later.
I'm not sure if the story... Yeah, there's some Sonic 4 stuff on the show later.
And that's ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
We'll get there when we get there.
Sorry.
I do think it's interesting, though, that it came out on the iPhone first.
I'm sure you guys have heard Sonic 4 is out on the iPhone now, and it's not out on consoles until this week, right?
I'll probably buy it on consoles anyway, just because I'm a consumer whore.
Yay!
And how, exactly.
Well, if you like the old school Sonic games, then you'll probably like it.
I didn't care for the old... I like Sonic 1, that was alright.
And Sonic & Knuckles was kind of fun, but... I don't know, I just don't like Sonic too much.
The Dreamcast one recently came out on the 360 as well, and I did play that a little bit a couple weeks ago.
And apparently that was a terrible port as well.
It was okay.
Actually, I know, I take that back.
It wasn't terrible.
It isn't the same game to me at all.
It's just not the same game to me at all.
Well, like, people are complaining about, like, graphics and stuff in there.
I'm like, it's a Dreamcast game.
What do you expect?
I mean, come on.
Because you're taking a game that you remember from your tiny TV in your bedroom that was hooked up with the RCA red, yellow, white cables or maybe even, like, the RF adapters.
Like, you know, minimal graphical ability for this day and age.
And now you're putting it on your HDTV.
Well, every flaw you're gonna see now and every rough polygon that was smooth before because the old TVs weren't
as Crisp.
And your expectations back then were way lower.
Remember when the Nintendo 64 stuff came out and hell, even before that, you know, just even some of the
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
What Capcom's planning on doing with the iPhone stuff, they're planning on doing something like Game Room, but with the Capcom games.
Oh, interesting.
As long as Quiz and Dragons is in there, I'm game.
Probably.
Quiz and Dragons was awesome.
It ran on the same hardware as, it was either CPS 1 or 2, I can't remember.
What's the one that Street Fighter 2's on?
Street Fighter 2 is CPS 2.
Okay, Quiz and Dragons was on that.
It was Magic Sword, Final Fight, they were all on that same engine.
Quiz and Dragons was awesome.
Just saying.
Look it up.
All right.
Anyhow, I think I need to bribe DarkSakura to make that a classic game of the week at some point.
Which one?
Just saying.
Quiz and Dragons.
You know, I never played it.
Really?
Yeah.
It's neat.
It's in one of those Capcom collections.
It's hard now because all the trivia questions are like from 92.
Who is president now?
It's like, oh, no.
I think it was Clinton.
Was it?
All right.
Anyhow.
Let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into some actual news.
What are you doing, DarkSakura?
I was looking at Minecraft.
It looks irritating.
It looks like an old school Doom, make your own Doom type of thing.
See, that right there is what I imagine ZZT would look like if they did it nowadays.
Oh, now you just sold me this.
Is this like ZZT?
Is this like a new ZZT?
You basically can dig and you can harvest stuff and you can create objects.
You can dig holes.
Yeah.
You can dig holes.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Jamie, pick up your mic.
I don't understand.
It's just fucking holes.
But you will sit there and play The Sims for God knows how long, but this is just fucking holes?
I'm not playing Dress Up!
But, okay.
I don't get it.
You can basically... Look at the videos on YouTube and stuff.
You can create houses and stuff and forts.
And later on, not to spoil anything, there's monsters... Wait, this is a closed page.
There's monsters that come that you have to defend your little house or castle or whatever the hell you decide to make in it.
and you can get torches that keep the evil things away.
It's like, it's a whole big, you know, it's almost like a little bit of tower defense with a little bit of, like, crafting and MMO with a little bit of, like, little big planet, you know,
It's a little of everything.
It's just people like it because they can be extremely creative in it, and it's one of those games that never really ends.
All right.
Chat.orange.radio.com.
Lots of comments.
Tiger Claw says, and many of the Atari 2600 games are two-player online and no ability to play with others online with it.
I agree.
Game Room has huge flaws, and that's why it's not doing as well as you would think it would, and that's one of them.
And it's very, very sad because...
Now nobody's going to attempt it again this generation, and that makes me very sad that they had such a great idea and then kind of made these few key decisions that just kind of ruin it.
Boo-hiss.
Let's see.
SalaciousPop says, Minecraft is item creation heaven hell.
You dig, you build, you explore, you defend, you resource farm forever.
Forever!
Chat.OrangeLondrina.com if you want to join us on this lovely Sunday evening.
While I get into some housekeeping, I didn't even mention it is 10, 10, 10.
42.
So happy.
Do you know how many people I know that got married today?
Today was a huge wedding day because of the day.
And I'm going to a wedding next weekend.
Bobby was off tonight because of a wedding.
Why?
It's so stupid.
So you can remember your anniversary?
That's what women want.
Women want days that are cute, right?
No, not me.
I was like, September 1st, that works for me.
Pee Wee Herman
Spazinator in our chatroom says, I still love Game Room despite its faults.
You know, that's kind of where I'm at, too, is that, you know, despite its faults, I do love the retro goodness that it brings out.
So it's like you have to love it.
Although, boy, they're really reaching now with some of these games they're putting out.
They're running out.
I don't think they were able to bring any other publishers on board.
That's kind of sad.
Let's see.
Oh, and people are reminding me.
Act F says 42 equals life, universe, and everything.
That's right, because 10, 10, 10 in binary is 42.
Which is the answer?
Some of you guys need to really get over the numerology thing.
I'm just saying.
No, no, no.
It has nothing to do with numerology.
Didn't you ever read Hitchhiker's Guide?
Like bits and pieces, but never the whole thing.
Okay, I will explain this in a nutshell.
The Earth was created to be a supercomputer to figure out the meaning of life or the answer to life or something.
And before it got destroyed, it only got as far as 42.
Okay.
Interesting.
So 42 is the answer.
So on the 42nd day, God rest it or whatever?
It's 42.
All right, fine.
Let's see.
So happy 10-10-10.

We're going to take those Twitter topics, so get those in for part B and so forth.

Blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.
Let's get into some actual gaming news.
We're only, what, 30 minutes into the show?
Need some gaming news?
Just a tad.
Just a little bit.
Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?
Well, lots of stuff.
In fact, there's a new, I guess you would call it a handheld console that's coming from somebody that used to be in the console business and is not anymore.
Panasonic.
You may remember them for the 3DO.
Then again, maybe you don't remember them for the 3DO because it wasn't that great.
um well now they have a wait was that the system with the terrible like Zelda and Mario knockoff games was that the 3DO or was it the CDI I always get those two mixed up cause they were they were right around the same time the 3DO had like some of the old um 3DO had Mega Race right did it um it may have had Mega Race it had I remember I played um You Don't Know Jack on the 3DO and I also played um Road Rash on the 3DO Road Rash is cool maybe Road Rash is what I was thinking of not Mega Race
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Apparently, they're gearing it for MMOs.
The thing runs Linux, so it's obviously going to be able to run other things, but honestly, I don't know many MMOs that run natively in Linux.
So, it's nice that you made a console for MMOs that don't yet really exist for the console.
Well, but they get a lot of stuff to run on Linux.
Does WoW run on Linux?
I don't think it does.
I think it's just PC and Mac.
Like, I know Blizzard's very... People have gotten to run in the GNOME.
I mean, not the GNOME, whatever the virtual environment is.
Wine.
Interesting.
It also comes with a mini HDMI port, a mini USB port, headphone jack, of course.
It is kind of thick-looking.
People say it looks kind of like the N-Gage.
I don't know if I'd compare it to the N-Gage.
Um, and funny enough, they, uh, unveiled it on the MTV show to which this, at this point I was unaware of, uh, Rob, looks like, uh, Rob, uh, Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory.
Yeah, I don't know anything about that show.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's a long way from downtown Julia Brown, that's all I'm saying.
I guess along with the system, Panasonic is launching a Battlestar Galactica title for the device and a web show called Online Underground.
I wonder if it's that same Battlestar Galactica MMO I saw at E3, because that looked kind of neat.
I don't know.
It looks neat.
I mean...
If it actually supported MMOs or something to the point where it would be able to run them without any sort of lag or something, that might not be bad.
I could see this almost as something that you could, say, for example, stream something, kind of like the on-live stuff.
Maybe have this portable device with you, it connects to the web, and you can stream, say, something from your PC so you can play an MMO on it or something.
Yes, you can.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
they have enabled that on all games but the thing is it really comes down to it comes down to the control set whether the control set will work with what's limited on the PSP but yeah anything is possible with the PS3 you can play any of the PS3 games on the PSP and I bet most people don't even know that type of functionality exists because Sony would rather market these other features that you know
Yeah.
But I don't know.
When I hear of this thing and I see this thing and you describing it, I don't think of this as like a handheld gaming device in a way.
It's pretty large.
Well, I file this under the iPad competitor department.
I mean, to me, yeah, it doesn't have a touchscreen or anything, but it seems more iPad-esque where it's more of like a computer that runs Linux.
Because if it runs Linux, then who's to say I can just run MMOs on it?
I mean, couldn't I do spreadsheets on it?
It's possible.
Right?
So it's more of a computer than a gaming device.
I guess it's all in the way they're marketing it, maybe, but it just seems strange to me.
Well, didn't Sony try to play off the PS3 as a computer?
Yeah, but I don't know that was different because it's not like... Well, but you could run Linux on the PS3 at least for a limited time.
You can't anymore.
But I don't think... I don't know how many people really use that feature.
I mean, when they took it out, certainly there was that core group of hackers and folks that were very upset.
And then what the military had been using it or something is the processors and those things are disgustingly fast.
So it's kind of like a really cheap supercomputer, but...
Most people didn't get a PS3 to run Linux on it.
Most people didn't.
Most people got it to be a cheap Blu-ray player.
I see it anyway.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, speaking of MMOs, whether this one will run on this device or not, I don't know.
But the biggest one, World of Warcraft, at least here in the U.S., has a release date for its next expansion.
That's right, the Cataclysm expansion.
will be starting on December 7th.
That's when World of Warcraft Cataclysm will hit stores.
It's going to be $40 when it comes out.
There will be a collector's edition for $80 that comes with an art book, commentary DVD, soundtrack CD, mouse pad, trading cards, and a little in-game pet called Lil' Deathwing.
So you can go out and run out and buy that in stores or, and I find this very interesting, we all kind of saw this coming after StarCraft II, they will be doing digital download with this.
That strikes me as kind of amazing because they're not going to have those awesome media opportunities of folks lining up outside of stores and all that unless I guess they're just getting the collector's edition.
People are pissed off that those collector's editions are really rare right now.
Well, it's kind of like any of the other expansions.
It's just interesting to me that they're going to go ahead and go the digital distribution route, and I don't know, it seems a little bit controversial, but Blizzard and the PC market can also kind of get away with doing whatever it wants right now, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And then they, what, moved it around a bunch?
No, no, no.
They hinted at it.
You said on the show it was going to be November, like a couple weeks ago.
Well, that's what I'm saying that they said, and that's compared to what they've released in the past.
But apparently, no, it was, they were saying, there was some comment that they made.
It was either an interview or something where they're like, yeah, there's a 12.7% chance of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And, you know, it was kind of a little hint that they threw out that no one caught until...
Like I'm saying, they could put this game out on Christmas Eve and people would still be lining up to get it.
I mean, it just doesn't matter.
It's that kind of game.
Same thing with Diablo 3.
If they wanted to release Diablo 3 on Thanksgiving, they could do it.
Let's see.
Looking at comments from chat.orangeontraday.com ToyGak in our chatroom says, I hate digital distribution.
Hard media forever.
Maybe physical media?
I don't know.
I know neither of you really play WoW, but let's say this was an expansion to a game you do really like.
Let's say DarkSakura was a Star Trek Online second edition or something, and I don't know, for Loki, Grand Theft Auto V. Would you bypass the store completely in favor of digital distribution?
No.
No.
DarkSakura.com
Although I have been known in the past to go the digital route to get it slightly early.
Alright, alright.
And then buy a physical copy later on.
Like when I couldn't find all my WoW stuff, I downloaded it.
When I would try to play again.
Boshka in our chatroom says collector's edition is barely worth it $40 for a pet, no thanks a lot of collector's editions just have a CD and a book and all that a lot of collector's editions nowadays to me it seems like they're not worth it anymore like I used to buy collector's editions for different things like Bioshock and Saints Row 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 and stuff like that it's just a bunch of crap that they throw in there I mean
Thank you for watching!
Frisbee in our chat says, but does it come with a plate and a spoon?
Kind of in a reference to that Dreamcast game that DarkSakura has.
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says, my biggest issue with digital distro is if something happens to my computer, if I can re-download it, I would do digital.
You know, that's something that Blizzard's pretty good about, though.
I mean, even if you have these games from way before there was ever digital distribution, like, for instance...
I see Dan up there in his collection has a Warcraft 3 game and there's a serial number on that if he goes to battle.net and enters in that serial number it'll get attached to his account and he could always redownload Warcraft 3 wherever he's at so it's kind of you know that is one thing Blizzard's pretty good about is that once you do have the game tied to your account you could always redownload it anywhere kind of interesting so
Anyhow, one other quick note here on World of Warcraft.
It was also announced by Blizzard this week that they have surpassed the 12 million subscriber mark.
That's right, there are now 12 million subscribers for World of Warcraft.
Keep in mind that's not just in the US.
This is partially attributed to the fact that Wrath of the Lich King finally came out in mainland China just about a month ago.
And of course, Cataclysm is coming out here soon, so everybody's getting ready for that.
So...
Who knows?
Yeah, this is interesting.
The last time there was a big population increase announcement was December 2008 when it got to 11.5 million.
So a lot of folks at that time thought, oh, wow, it's topped off, it's dying.
But nope, they got up to 12 million this week.
But probably not likely to ever get as high as 20 million as some people thought it once would.
There's 20 million people living in Australia, just so you know.
Come on, Australia.
What's the holdup?
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
Some more stuff.
Oh, I love stuff.
How about DC Universe?
Yay, I'm really looking forward to DC Universe Online.
Well, you gotta wait.
No.
It's been delayed until spring 2010.
No.
Wait, spring 2010, then it's already out.
11.
No.
Which means that...
It's going to be a while.
However, the beta is going to be available in November.
That will be, if you pre-order the game, then you are guaranteed access to the November 30th beta.
You have to pre-order before November 15th to make it into the beta.
So you can still get the game in November, you just have to pre-order the game to play the test game?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Are they going to pay me to be a tester?
Because I'm doing their job, right?
Of course not.
I'm still very excited about DC Universe Online.
I'm sad to hear it's getting delayed, but at the same time, there was another big MMO that came out very recently that I said should probably be delayed until 2011.
But boy, did they listen.
Yeah, boy, did they listen.
So you know what?
If that's what this game has to do to take the time to get it right, then you know what?
So be it.
It's okay, Rob.
They can always just patch it later on.
That's right.
It's an MMO.
It doesn't need to be finished.
Finish?
It's never finished.
It's an MMO.
We're always adding stuff.
I mean, fixing things.
I mean, making it not shitty.
Tiger Claw sharing a new sound effect for us.
I guess this is the sister to sad trombone to play when we have depressing stories like DC Universe Online is delayed until spring 2011.
Oh, that's not a new one.
This is called sadtuba.com.
It's not a sad tuba.
The price is right losing horn.
I thought it was going to be the sad trombone thing played on a tuba.
So I thought it would be.
Whatever.
That's the craziest, dorkiest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Anyhow, let's move on quickly before I embarrass myself again.
Yeah, so this is kind of neat.
OnLive apparently is ditching the monthly charge and they're going free.
And apparently they're also working on... Well, they did talk about this.
They're working on a mini streaming console that's supposed to be manufactured soon.
Apparently, the former $14.95 per month service, which was through its founding members program, they have offered now a year of free service.
Apparently, they're also going to be offering a bunch of free demos and stuff to check out.
I think that the free service is not free forever.
I think it's just...
You know, like a trial type thing.
And you can basically create an account with no monthly cost, no credit card needed for sign up, and lots of free stuff to play.
And then the micro console, it's going to be like kind of a streaming box.
Think of like a sling box or something like that with a controller built in and you can basically plug it into a TV.
I guess it almost looks like maybe like an Apple TV or something like that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, I mean, that was certainly a drawback to OnLive was this whole monthly fee.
Like, really?
You're going to pay me a monthly fee to buy games?
Seems a little strange.
It's like you're having to join... I'd like someone to pay me a monthly fee to buy games.
No, I thought that the monthly fee was just to play whatever on their service.
No, no, no.
You still have to rent the games or buy the games.
And even when you buy them, it's only guaranteed for three years because you're playing on someone else's computer.
So if the service ever gets shut down in three years or whatever, then it's gone.
So it's still a little bit iffy, but if you're the type that just wants to rent games or check out the game demos, which certainly is useful, then it might be worth it.
I still need to sign up and check it out.
I would like to make use of the game rental part.
I think the whole free demo thing might be kind of cool because, say, for example...
you know you want to play like one of the new games that's coming out recently or very soon or something like that and they have a demo for it you don't want to spend time downloading i mean because some of these demos out there are you know a few gigs in the download that it might take a very long time and then you have to install it and that takes more time this you can just
Play it and go.
Oh, don't like it?
Go to the next one.
No need to download, install, worry about doing all that stuff.
Just kind of play it as you go.
Yeah.
And plus you could have a crappy computer and it still plays.
And that would be kind of cool to do with, say, an Xbox 360 or something like that.
So I don't have to download the demo.
I can just, boom, play the demo instantly.
I bet that's going to be a big feature in the next generation of consoles.
Maybe.
I said a while ago that this is the games analyst in me.
One of them, probably PlayStation, is going to be ballsy enough to try and go all digital.
Just cut out the physical media completely.
That worked so well for them in the past.
Well...
I think it'll be different.
The problem with the PSP Go is that it was really more money for the removal of a future.
But if they had charged $99 for that thing, it would have done great.
That's the difference.
So.
Well, with the PSP2 being announced next year, I'm sure we'll see what's coming.
Well, we will.
One thing we know is coming very soon is NBA Jam.
And apparently lots of interesting stuff going on with NBA Jam.
I don't know if this was covered last week or if it was this week or what, but NBA Jam, I guess, ended up getting split off from the NBA game on the 360 and the PS3, right?
Yeah.
So now it's coming out as a standalone game.
So that's kind of interesting.
Yeah.
and one thing we wanted to see in NBA Jam would be hidden characters because you know the old school NBA Jam was awesome because it had what?
It had like Scorpion and some of the Mortal Kombat characters and I think Bill Clinton was in there somewhere, right?
Oh yeah.
Well, apparently this new NBA Jam is keeping with the political ha-ha's
and you can actually unlock Obama and Sarah Palin as playable characters so yeah there are it's out on the Wii now so you can check it out and there's actually some codes have already been found on how to unlock certain things I guess you can get some furries and everything wow yeah I'm trying to look at some of the things you can unlock here yeah it looks like you can unlock some of the mascots there
Oh.
Yeah, they have the mascots available in the old ones too.
A furry dream.
You can have Bush and Chaney on your team.
Why?
Because you want them to play basketball.
Because Bush has mad hoop skills, of course.
There you go.
So I'm trying to look up some of these codes.
Where are they?
Ah, there we go.
You can unlock the Beastie Boys as a team.
Yeah.
It sounds like.
Wow.
There's actually a lot of hidden people in this.
That's kind of cool.
ManuteBowl is hidden in there.
Good times.
I was going to say, I don't know if you heard about how close NBA Elite was to being released.
I mean, to the point where an actual retail copy of it leaked out like a disc because I guess they sent them to retailers and then the retailers had to send them back.
Oh, wow.
And apparently, according to the person that bought one of the retail copies off eBay, the game was really buggy and really fucking terrible.
Like, just all sorts of glitches and bad stuff in there.
And then, of course, they had NBA Jam on the PS3 with that.
And apparently that was... They have, I guess, some of the features that they're talking about adding in now were actually going to be download content in there.
So they're saying, oh yeah, it's not done yet.
We're adding remix mode or whatever to the game.
Well, actually, we're going to release it anyways.
You just, now you're not spending extra money for it or something.
TigerClaw sent me a link in our chatroom at chat.orangemonster.com and I remember seeing this earlier this week and kind of like rolling my eyes.
It's one of these stories about when people who don't play games talk about games.
Oh.
Yeah, did you hear about this?
This is on Fox News.
facing off against President Obama in basketball.
Not on some court in Washington or Wasilla.
It's the new Nintendo Wii version of the video game NBA Jam.
And I apologize, this is quiet.
Head-to-head competition shooting hoops along with a host of high-profile politicians.
Peter Moore is president.
Anyway, they go on to wonder if they're going to make a bipartisan game and all this stuff.
I'm just like, really?
Come on.
Anyhow.
Because Obama had some sort of super move and the rest didn't.
So that's unfair.
Well, he's the president and the rest aren't.
I mean, it's really quite that simple, right?
In theory, right?
Ugh.
Anyhow.
Rob.
What?
How about something a little different?
How about something a little different?
More about the Wii.
Well, we just had a story on the Wii.
But this is about Capcom.
Oh, okay.
There's going to be some more downloads coming out for Virtual Console.
Of course, this is particularly for the UK release.
There is going to be...
Ghosts and Goblins, which we love in this house.
And 1942 will be available.
Also, Black Dragon, which is a little obscure.
They said they don't have a date yet on them, but they're going to be 800 points apiece.
And also other ones that were recently announced were Commando, Son Son, and...
XX, so X-Dexis, XX.
Where's Quiz and Dragons?
I've been asking since the top of the show, where's my Quiz and Dragons?
Is that on the list?
No.
Alas, no, Rob, it is not on the list.
Pingo!
Pingo was a Sega game, wasn't it?
That was Sega.
I was just thinking of more obscurity.
There you go.
I like this.
There's a little bit of delay between when we talk and when the chat room gets it.
So the chat room is commenting on the whole Fox News thing.
Chat.orangehunchradio.com This is a good joke.
They're talking about how Obama gets the special move.
The Republicans have nothing.
Hitstun goes, but all the Republicans have an 8 in steel.
Get it?
It's a political joke.
Come on, come on.
Come on, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, that's kind of funny.
I want Abraham Lincoln to be in NBA Jam.
I think they should do an all-presidential one.
That'd be awesome.
And why leave it to just U.S.
presidents?
Why not do some royalty as well?
Margaret Thatcher!
That's right, get Margaret Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Gaga while we're at it.
Should definitely be on a team.
I'm really surprised.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Chuck Norris.
Well, we have a list list coming up.
I don't think we're going to end up doing it tonight.
I think we'll roll it over to next week when we actually have a special guest here.
But we're actually going to do a list list on character I most want to see in NBA Jam.
So you can look forward to that.
We'll probably end up doing that next week.
I think we're going to table that to next week because we didn't end up having a fourth person here tonight.
We are going to have a guest next week.
I'll talk more about that a little later on in the show because it's very exciting for very exciting reasons.
It's going to be retrotastic next week and I'll tell you why.
Exciting guest is exciting.
A little later on in the show.
In the meantime, let's go and travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming soon to a store near you, Loki.
Yes, lots of good stuff actually.
Because we're knee deep in releases this week.
Starting off, of course, the big one, Medal of Honor on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
Arcania Gothic 4.
Super Scribblenauts Sledge Shred
DarkSakura,
But this is a terrible game, and it's on the Wii.
Other fun stuff.
Let's see.
Disney Sing It Party hits on the Wii and PS3.
Zuzu Pets, Kung Zu on Nintendo DS and Wii.
Or maybe just on the DS.
Vampire Moon, The Mystery of the Hidden Sun.
It's another adventure game on Nintendo DS.
Um...
You know, Frisbee in our chatroom asked a damn good question.
Is Deal or No Deal still on?
I don't think it is.
Like, the syndicated one got canned this year, didn't it?
I don't know.
You know what's coming back, though?
Because I read game show blogs.
One versus a...
I think Deal or No Deal is still on the air because now they're doing the stupid thing where it's like the actual contestants are opening the cases.
They couldn't afford to pay the models anymore.
No, that was the syndicated one.
I don't think that's on the air anymore.
I think that went off the air to make room for this year's batch of judge shows and all that.
But no, I will say 1 vs. 100 is officially coming back to Game Show Network and it has a new host.
It's not going to be Bob Saget.
You ready for this?
Guess who's hosting 1 vs. 100 now?
Arsino Hall tested for it, but no, they passed over Arsino Hall for... Ready?
Get your groaning noises ready.
Oh wait, let me get SadTuba ready.
Hold on, hold on.
I need to get SadTuba ready for this.
Let me think.
I'm trying to guess how terrible it could be.
Uh, it's not Mark McGrath, is it?
No, it's not.
I think he does the lyrics show.
Yeah, but he's still terrible.
Okay.
No, hosting 1 vs. 100 on Game Show Network with a top prize of $50,000, down from a million, Carrie Ann Inaba.
Who the hell's that?
From Dancing with the Stars.
Oh.
Huh?
Yeah, exactly.
She's the girl on Dancing with the Stars.
I'm telling you.
Because you know it takes a real dancer to know how to... If you want to replace Bob Saget, you know who you need to pick.
What?
Tom Bergeron.
Tom Bergeron.
Yes, exactly.
Well, he's busy hosting Dancing with the Stars.
There's like the biggest show on TV now.
Oh, come on, it doesn't take that long to host Dancing with the Stars.
I mean, come on, he can fit it in his workday to go host that other show.
I mean, shit, that's like, you know, maybe four hours at the most.
It's crazy pants to me, though, that the 1 vs. 100 is, like, gone from Xbox Live so that they can do this cheap version on Game Show Network with Kariana Nava.
You know what I mean?
No disrespect.
I'm sure it'll be fine, and it's gonna be, you know, for an original game show, it'll be fine.
Did you...
No, this is totally random, but it makes no sense because I actually saw this on the soup, I think.
Punk'd is coming back, and they're having Justin Bieber hosting it.
What the hell is that?
No, that has to be a lie.
I don't believe that.
That has as much truth as the LAPD buying all the jetpacks.
That's how true that story is.
Come on.
No way.
Justin Bieber is too busy.
He's making 15-year-old girls' panties wet all across internationally.
That's his job.
He doesn't have time to do punk.
And seriously, they have a bunch of other cast members from that 70s show that aren't working right now that can easily host that.
Exactly.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
My Baby 3 on the Nintendo DS.
This was the game that actually had a lawsuit pending with it because Majesco and apparently some other company were fighting over the rights to My Baby.
they're fighting over my baby Borderlands give me the year edition coming out this week that's right Borderlands with all the extra download content all for 60 bucks that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 seriously if you don't own this game you need to buy it which I don't actually so this might be a good deal you need to buy it it's fucking amazing I'm gonna wait for the price drop the inevitable price drop that will happen on this game
I think the original game has already dropped in price.
No, but I can get the one with all the Uber content.
Isn't there like a zombie expansion or something?
Yeah, that was one of the first expansions.
I need that, don't I?
It's awesome.
It seriously is awesome.
Okay, and then the Invisimals coming out on the PSP this week.
That's right, it's the game with the camera.
Yay, camera.
I've only been waiting years for that stupid thing to come out on the PSP, and now you release it with a crappy-ass game.
By the way, iPet's coming out on the PSP in a couple weeks anyways.
Yay, terrible.
Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals on Nintendo DS.
Wow, Lufia's old school.
Isn't a Lufia what I use in the shower to wash my butt?
That's a Lufa.
Canada Hunt on the Wii it's where you hunt Canadians
Awesome.
Really?
No, it's not.
Oh, I was like, damn.
If by Canadians you mean native wildlife in Canada.
Like mooses and shit?
Yes.
Oh, boring.
Dragon's Lair Trilogy.
This is awesome because it doesn't have three dragons.
There was no third Dragon's Lair.
I bet one of them is Space Ace.
You are correct.
I'm like, wait a minute.
There was no Dragon's Lair 3.
It's sort of Dragon's Lair.
It's Dragon's Lair in space.
Oh, sorry.
Lucha Libre Heroes Del Ring that's coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week Dragon Age Origins the Ultimate Edition also another re-release with both Dragon Age Origins and the Awakenings expansion I think all the download content as well that's going to be coming out for $50 at least on PC I think it's $60 on PS3 and 360 um
Okay, that makes no sense at all.
Oh, I guess that was with the system.
Never mind.
For a second there, I thought they were selling invisibles by itself.
I'm like, what would you do with that?
You don't have the camera.
That's right, bringing the gaming news to you, we think, here at Orange Sands Radio.
No, they're actually selling the system because they think Invisimals is a system seller.
Oh, that's a brace yourself.
That's hilarious.
Sengoku Barsara Samurai Heroes, the game which was originally over here as... Oh, of course, now I can't remember.
Oh, Devil Kings.
That's on PlayStation 3 and on the Wii, of course, because it uses Waggle.
And now PS3 has Waggle, so that's also fun.
I Love Puppies on Nintendo DS.
Yes.
I'm not going to say really much more about that.
Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, the game of the year edition with all the download content in there.
Good God.
That's like the third one.
They're doing a lot of re-releases.
Ooh, is Just Dance 2 this week?
Just Dance 2 is this week.
Yes!
Reason to hook up my Wii.
I played it.
It was pretty fun.
And no, I don't know where the YouTube videos are.
Damn.
They're out there somewhere.
Before I die, I have to see Loki getting down to TikTok.
Oh no, it was worse than that.
We did It's Rainy Men.
Oh my god.
It's somewhere on YouTube, right?
Already?
I don't know if it is on YouTube.
Tiger Claw needs to find it.
Because he finds everything on the internet.
I can find it if it's actually out there.
I'll do that later.
um hey Miklatov sent me a private message that he is buying the Invisimals bundle because it's blue well that's his own weird fascination with stuff colored blue I mean I don't know uh the Guild 2 Renaissance that's on uh PC not the Felicia Day show not the Felicia Day show uh Painkiller Pandemonium on PC meh um
I didn't realize Rock Band 3 was coming out this week.
What?
No, it's not.
Shut up.
Yeah, it's not.
But for some reason, the wireless keyboard's available this week.
Awesome!
I can pretend I'm playing Rock Band.
That's great.
Oh, and it would be great also, Solitaire Overload Plus.
These release dates coming to an end, that would be great too.
No, they're not.
God!
Hello Kitty DS Bundle, they're releasing Hello Kitty with a... Because clearly you've saved the AAA titles for last.
Brunswick Cosmic Bowling with a Bowling Ball.
That sounds dangerous.
They just did that to make it lulzy to fit that on the shelves at GameStop.
Now, this is GameStop's website.
I'm reading off of it right here.
The Wii inflatable racing cart.
That's right.
The one that you can play Mario Kart in is coming to stores this week.
That is exciting.
Wait, wait, wait.
There's an actual inflatable cart?
Inflatable cart that you can sit in.
You stick the steering wheel in there and you... I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Jamie, I want to buy this and bring it over.
Okay.
You can spend your money on it and you can drive over here.
How much is it?
How much is the inflatable cart?
It's 40 bucks.
That's quite a bit of money.
I don't know.
I was actually going to say, because I don't think it made our show roll, but they actually have, there was another peripheral that's coming out that's also inflatable.
It is an inflatable raft to play with Connect Adventures.
Yeah, it was on our Twitter.
That's right.
Whatever.
And we got it.
Yeah.
It's an inflatable raft.
It's just an inflatable raft.
That's all it is.
Good times.
Because, you know, people can't pretend they have the actual inflatable raft for the truly immersive experience, apparently.
Okay, this is a pretty big one this week.
Kirby's Epic Yarn is coming out on the Wii, and that'll be a week from today.
And that is it.
All right.
Let's go to Japanese release dates.
I'll try to make this quick and painless.
In Japan, on the Xbox 360, Medal of Honor gets its release this week.
NBA 2K11, also coming out in Japan this week.
SBKX Superbike World Championship comes out as well.
And some new Xbox 360 wireless headsets and network adapters come out in some different colors.
I don't know if that's because of the soon-to-come upgrades with the voice chat.
I don't know.
But those are coming out anyhow.
Moving on over to the PlayStation 3 Medal of Honor NBA 2K11 and World Soccer Winning 11 2011 all come out this week.
So look forward to that.
World Soccer Winning 11 is a few days behind the others.
I think it's on a special day.
So just a heads up on that.
It's not on the usual release day.
Going over to the Nintendo Wii, and the game's coming out there.
Kaito no Kirby comes out on the Nintendo Wii, which is just the same Kirby game that Loki was earlier talking about.
It's just the Japanese version.
Nothing on the PlayStation 2, because obviously things are drying up over there.
But looking at the handhelds real quick, on the Sony PSP, DJ Max Portable 3 comes out.
And I know we have some folks that are really into the music games that are really looking forward to this, probably already have their pre-orders ready.
Set to go.
That is coming out in Korea this week.
The first print and the limited edition.
I'm sure there's folks already having their imports on the way.
Otherwise, as far as Japanese releases go, Lord of Arcana comes out this week.
That is a Squeenix game that is coming out in Japan.
So take a look at that if you're into the Squeenix games.
otherwise NBA 2K11 also coming out on the PSP and Memories Off 6 Next Relation is coming out as well I have no idea what that is but it's called Memories Off 6 Next Relation it just shows kind of a chick dancing on the cover so I'm just more relations I'm assuming it's just yet another little dating game because but there's a part where she's singing karaoke and there's another part look at this this girl here she's kind of a whore like she's lying on the bed and her blouse is like half open look at that I can see her boobies you don't see nipple but you definitely see her boobies
She's just tired.
And it must be hard.
Tired of wearing clothes.
That's what she's tired of.
Quickly on the DS.
I skipped over the DS completely.
Let me see if I can look up DS releases real quick here.
Don't think there's a whole lot coming out this week, actually.
Gingotetsu Duo 999 DS.
It's in a huge box.
It's an exotic sci-fi game.
Coming out.
Oh, because it's in limited and premium box edition.
Let's see if there's screenshots here on the regular version.
Isn't that Galaxy Express or something?
It could be because I noticed it has the Chi-Chi train in it.
Oh, okay, so it's Galaxy Express.
Oh, there it is.
Look at that, you anime nerds.
Love it.
Did you see what they're doing live action?
Oh, what the fuck was it?
It's Spaceship Yamamoto.
Yamato.
Yamato, yeah.
They're doing a live action one of that.
Looks awesome.
It was Starblazers in the US.
Yeah, wake me when they have a panty and stocking game, okay?
That's all I'm saying.
That's something Alan turned me on to this week.
Panty and stocking.
Look it up on YouTube.
It's epic.
We need the music, Rob.
Need more cosplay.
Do we need the music?
We need the music.
Hold on, I'll get the music.
Can you explain what panty and stocking is real quick while I get the music?
It's an anime by Gainax and the same guys that did Powerpuff Girls Z, which was the sort of more teenage version of Powerpuff Girls they did in Japan.
Okay, she needs to get to the good stuff.
Okay.
The chick kicks off her panties and turns them into a gun.
Okay.
It's about two angels kicked out of heaven, one for having too much sex and the other for eating too much sex.
This is from their transformation.
This sounds very luminous.
This could totally be inluminous.
The whole series isn't animated like this though.
That's the regular style.
was there anything else to say about this?
she shoots the shit monster in the face
I dug the kind of the swing music for Space Channel 5.
I dig it too, but like, you know, I want something a little cross between like Rez, Children of Eden with, you know, like Space Channel 5.
Less of the psychedelic stuff, but, you know, still that kind of high energy type of game.
Because I don't know if a lot of people get into the swing stuff, although I totally dig the old soundtrack, but...
I could see something like that.
Just really off the wall.
Sadly, I don't think it will have that same theme.
Just so you know.
It's a little inappropriate for us rude Americans that don't understand the finer things in life.
It really isn't that far away from Bayonetta.
I'm just saying.
That's a game I need to go back and finish.
Honestly, when Alan first explained that to me, I was like, is this a sequel to Bayonetta?
What is this?
Banna is so awesome.
Alright, DarkSakura, UK releases.
Sorry.
UK releases take us like an hour on this show.
Can I speak now, please?
Yes, you can.
For the UK, on the 12th, we have Arcania, Gothic 4, and EverQuest, House of Thul.
Thul.
Thul!
Okay.
Also, LEGO Universe, Pinball FX 2.
On the 13th is Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Episode 1.
And the 15th is Alan Wake, The Rider, and Medal of Honor.
Also, Naruto, Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2.
Okay.
That's it.
And that's what I have to say about Naruto games.
Of which there are always plenty.
Alright.
It wins a poopy.
Alright.
Loki, what do you got for us in gaming news?
Ultimate Ninja 2 is actually really awesome.
I don't know if you've seen it.
It looks like an interactive anime.
Thanks for watching!
Okay, so other stuff that's not Naruto related, of course.
This is kind of odd to be hearing a first-party company say, but apparently Nintendo is saying, hey, you know what?
You can't blame piracy for poor game sales.
Or at least they're saying you can't blame piracy completely for poor game sales.
I don't think we should attribute bad software sales solely to piracy.
They're talking a little bit about, this was I guess during a Q&A session I guess last week when they were talking about the 3DS pricing and stuff like that.
It's true there's always an influence of piracy, but it's important for us to increase the number of our consumers who are willing to shell out their money to purchase our products.
So we do not intend to think that slower sales are solely due to piracy.
And I kind of agree with them because a lot of people out there, you know, people that pirate games aren't necessarily people that buy games.
So if you lose a sale to someone pirating a game doesn't mean you're actually going to lose a sale, you know, a physical copy sale because they were never going to purchase a copy of the game in the first place.
DarkToagak in our chat room is saying, Nintendo's saying that?
Bullshit.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Um, but it was Iwata that said that, so.
What, and it was a magazine interview?
I'm sorry, I missed the source.
No, this was, it wasn't a magazine interview.
It was during, I guess a live interview during their Nintendo conference thing.
Wow.
When they were talking about like the 3DS pricing and stuff like that.
Oh, right, okay.
So, um.
Well, I mean, you're kind of right in that regard that I think the people who pirate games aren't usually the ones who are going to run to the store and buy them anyway.
The thing I do kind of see as a problem... Not that it excuses it.
No, it doesn't excuse it.
But I think, for example, like on the Wii and stuff, a lot of the games that are more niche or adult and stuff don't seem to do as well as, say, some of the games that most people would be like, why is that selling so much?
It's just a shitty-ass party game.
But people buy that stuff.
Just like Just Dance, a game that when it first came out, I'm like, this is stupid.
and then it's just at the top of the charts and then you play it and you're like wow this is actually kind of fun I had people come up to me at work who knew I had a video game addiction and asked me if I've ever played it because they had and they had so much fun with it and I'm thinking like really?
It's weird the thing about Just Dance though and it's kind of funny is you know that Michael Jackson experience it's pretty much the same game but that has also karaoke in there as well if you want to otherwise it's Just Dance, Michael Jackson that's basically what that is
but it's probably part of the agreement with the Michael Jackson camp or whatever you call it that they can't put Michael Jackson's name below the title of the game like like probably like when Beatles rock band came out there's no way they were gonna call that game rock band Beatles it was always the Beatles rock band yeah you know I mean
I'm the same thing with Michael Jackson
except Dance Central and what I like about Dance Central a little bit more than say Just Dance is Dance Central first off can read your whole body it's not just reading the sensor so for example if you want to play Just Dance and kind of cheat at it you just do what they're doing with your one hand holding your remote your right hand you just do what they're doing on the screen you don't have to really do the rest of it
DarkSakura.com
so I think that's kind of neat there but yeah it's games like that that kind of appeal to the mass audience that seem to do well and then on the Wii or on the DS poor sales I mean a lot of that can be attributed to the games themselves because there's a lot of junk on the DS a lot of junk and unfortunately a lot of good games out there just kind of get ignored because of all the junk that's out there
Hey man, don't you want to pre-order your copy?
Hey, you look like a man on the mission.
Is there anything I can help you find?
No, I'm just looking around, killing time for my pizza.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Yeah, I thought so too.
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Because I thought sitting around at a pizza place sucks.
No, but there was a kid walking around and he's like, is Far Cry Predator a good game?
And it's just like, well, that came out a while ago.
And besides, you're like 10.
You shouldn't be playing a mature rated game.
Because your parents don't care.
You know, but when we were young... Oh, God.
Here we go.
When we were young and playing those 8-bit Nintendo games, there was a lot of crap that we liked that I bet a lot of people kind of looked at and went, boy, this is not a good game.
But see, a lot of the focus, though, was about games being fun.
See, now... And now, I get it that there's a lot of that stuff out there now that...
I mean, back in our day, there was also educational games and stuff like that, too.
But we were smart enough to know, okay, that's an educational game.
I'm not touching that shit.
Unless it was Oregon Trail or Number Munchers.
Hey, well that stuff was force-fed onto us, you know, at an early age.
And, you know, we just adapted to it.
But I'm saying, like, you know, with... There's a lot of educational product out there on the DS.
There's a lot of crappy licensed games.
Well, there's a lot of crappy licensed games even on the NES.
Although Cool Spot was awesome.
And Yonoid wasn't that bad.
So they could pull it off back then.
It's just now, unfortunately, it's all about the license and not about the gameplay.
as you know they have the Jelly Belly puzzle game and the still waiting for my Kill Bill video game that's all I'm saying never gonna happen

If you get three versions, you'll get a special call-out on the Sega blogs and the Sonic 4 website's news feed and special placement in one very cool spot to be revealed.
Ooh.
And if you get all four versions, so meaning what?
$15 on the PS3, $15 on the 360, $15 on the Wii, and what?
Another $10 on the iPhone, right?
So if you buy all four versions, you will be featured in a special video shout-out from Aaron Weber, who's the Sega Community Manager and the Brand Manager for Sonic 4, Ken Balo.
That video will be posted on Sega's YouTube page and all across Sega realms here on the internets.
And that's the exact quote, here on the internets.
There you go.
You could be internet famous if you drop $55 on Sonic 4.
What do you say, DarkSakura?
Let's buy them all.
Okay.
I love the enthusiasm.
Loki, what do you think?
You gonna buy them all to get mentioned?
I'm buying none of them.
Screw you, Sega.
I don't need you to say my name, you know, in order to feel special.
Frisbee in our chat says, the call out?
Thanks for nothing, fool.
Salacious Pop says, wow, no one cur.
and Actdeft says, my name featured on a sticky thread.
Seriously.
See, that's the thing.
It's in a sticky thread, but who the fuck's going to read the sticky thread?
Oh, hey, look, Bob's name's on there.
Way to go, Bob, purchasing two copies of the game.
You're an idiot.
I wonder though if they say the special placement in one very cool spot for buying three versions.
I wonder if that's in the credits of Sonic 4 Part 2.
That's probably what it is.
That's still dumb.
Don't you want your name in a video game?
It should reward you with Episode 2 instead of just... Oh, so like incentives.
They've already spoiled who the main character of Episode 2 is going to be.
Oh, are you going to spoil it for all our listeners?
I don't even know what the character's name is because once again, I don't follow Sonic.
It's a stupid Sonic robot thing.
Not Metal Sonic, but it's the one with, he has a spiky nose.
That's my wonderful description of the Sonic character.
Frisbee in our chatroom says, if you want your name in a thread, just post in that thread.
That's a good idea.
I'm going to start, no, I'm not going to do that because that would require effort.
I was going to say, someone should start a thread on that same forum of people who put their names in who haven't bought any copies of it.
Defective Candy in our chatroom says, maybe you guys could say, hey, give me five bucks and we'll stick your name to the top of the OLR forums.
I'd love to, but I don't know.
That just seems really wrong to me.
It's just really wrong.
Actdeft in our chat says, Loki, Sky, and Jamie need to buy one each and get OLR mentioned, though.
No, I'm not buying a copy of that.
You can buy three and get OLR mentioned.
Exactly.
I would like to submit a fake name.
Like, you know, Bonnie Von Fluffles or something like that.
You know, like, submit fake names.
That would be funny to get this community manager to say.
Sassy Pants Fuzzy Bottom?
Exactly.
I love that idea.
And big shout out to Sassy Pants Fuzzy Bottom.
Good times.
Let's take a look in gaming's history and the way things used to be in a better time.
It's the classic game of the week.
It's the part of our show where DarkSakura goes into the vault and says, Hey, I'm going to find a game that these kids should be playing.
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week for these little brats who don't know better?
The classic game is Final Fantasy V. Yay.
Yay.
I picked boss music because I couldn't find anything else.
Yeah, it's a game by Square.
Came out in 1992.
It was only out in Japan for the longest time on the Super Famicom.
And it's super fun.
It stars a guy named Bartz, who actually, for the longest time, it was Buttz.
Which I used to laugh, but anyway.
A meteor falls and he goes to check it out and then, oh noes, we need the crystals.
We have to seal Exdeath, which is the coolest name for a bad guy in a series ever.
Exdeath.
Wouldn't you be afraid, Rob?
I might be afraid of Exdeath.
Anyway, the cool thing about this game is the job system.
You get your experience point and you battle monsters and stuff like any Final Fantasy game.
You can get a chocobo and you get a ship and an airship and you do different stuff.
This is the second one that uses the active time battle, where time will flow continuously for both players and enemies, which was first in Final Fantasy IV, which was 2 when it came out over here.
The job system, though, is a really cool thing, because you can gain different special abilities and sort of mix up your jobs.
You get ability points, so you increase the job levels for different characters.
And you can also say, say you have a knight who also has white magic levels, well then you become a paladin, for an example.
This is also the game that introduced the blue mage, the time mage, and the mime.
So that's why we have them in other Final Fantasy games.
This is a really cool game.
It had lots of cool characters.
You have Lena, Bartz, Forrest, Kreel.
They're really cool.
Also, a reoccurring boss, which is what this music is, is Gilgamesh.
Always Gilgamesh.
Lots of Gilgamesh battles.
So yeah, it's a pretty cool game.
If you haven't played it yet, for the longest time you can only play it if you either had the cartridge or had a really good emulator.
Read Japanese or it was translated.
So it's really cool.
It was also one of... And your microphone failed at this game.
What?
You can hear me.
Now I can.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, as I was saying, it's one of the ones that was directed by Sakaguchi, sorry.
And this is his favorite Final Fantasy game.
All of the character designs, logo, everything was done by Amano.
Yoshitaka Amano, who is my hero.
And the battle graphics were done by Nomura.
So that's pretty cool.
And...
MAMBO DE CHOCOPO
We have since seen it elsewhere.
It's come out on the PlayStation in Japan.
There was a Final Fantasy collection that came out over here that had Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 6 on it.
It had a full motion video opening.
Very cool.
And then we had the Final Fantasy Anthology also on the PlayStation.
And...
They, uh, that's why they, uh, where they changed the name to, uh, Bart.
And Gil instead of Guido.
Um, there was PlayStation 2 release.
There was...
Game Boy Advance release.
They had an extra level and a new boss.
And they were designed by Amano.
And then there was Final Fantasy V Advance.
And it was really cool.
There was, however, an anime that was called Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystals.
It was an OAV.
It was done by Studio Madhouse.
And it was the sequel to Final Fantasy V.
there you go alright your classic game of the week boys and girls Final Fantasy 5 the one that was just too cool for America for so many years but finally Square came to their damn senses so there it is
we're tired of you people just downloading ROMs here, shoot Salacious Pop in our chatroom says can I ask why we haven't heard of Final Fantasy 5 or 6 for DS yet?
3 and 4 remakes were white glove and awesome I would like to see a 5 remake on the DS they were working on one there's a talk of it but not just at last interview maybe they will be on the 3 DS maybe that's why it's been held up a little while that's right, very special
Alright, we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but never fear, we'll be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio or Rapid Fire News Twitter topics, so make sure you get those in at twitter.com slash OLR if you have something you want us to talk about.
We'll talk a little bit about a classic arcade game that has me very happy coming back to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and I'm sure all of you will too.
Mega Man Legends 3 news.
The audience is in control.
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
We'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are taping live on this Sunday evening, October the 10th of 2010.
Happy 10-10-10 to all of you folks out there listening.
We are taping the 385th episode of our show, believe it or not.
Let it loose, baby
So you can just hear the epic epicness in it.
It's like the music on the title screen, which is...
So yeah, I love the Civilization series.
What can I say?
I have yet to check out 5, though.
It's all part of that whole, like, I spent all my money on Disneyland this month, so I haven't purchased a lot of games, but that's one of the ones I've got to look into getting, for sure.
So, we'll see.
By the way, things going on this week.
Guess what is happening this Wednesday?
Do you know what this Wednesday is?
Wednesday is a very important day for me.
It is October 13th.
Anyone?
Anyone?
It is my... You all right?
I was going to answer.
Yeah, because you know I told you before the show.
All right.
It's my 10-year anniversary of playing DDR.
That's right.
10 years ago on October the 13th was the first day I ever played DDR, which might not seem like a big deal to all of you because like, oh, hey, dancing, arrow stomping game, ha-ha, funny.
But if it weren't for DDR, this show wouldn't exist.
I probably would not know Jamie or Matt if it weren't for DDR.
We probably would have ran into each other in some nerd circle one way or another, but it just would not have happened the same way.
So...
Next week on the program, to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of me playing DDR, we've actually invited a guest who was there that night because it was her first time ever playing DDR.
She's going to be here next week on the show.
Jessica Harper from Understation Live is going to be here in the house.
Some of you guys know her as Iguana Girl, one of the admins of DDR Freak for, I believe, a couple years.
So she has a lot of Ditter history.
So it'll be good times.
We're going to have her on the show.
and kind of look back on DDR and video games at large because I know she plays some other video games too so we're going to have a good time next week.
See, Travis says I don't love Under Station Live enough sometimes but you know what?
We're going to have one of the hosts right here on the show so it'll be a good time.
This is heart, heart, heart, heart, love.
Exactly.
Heart, heart, heart, love.
Good times.
And he's welcome to come out here anytime he wants.
That's right.
If Travis wants to fly his ass out to Sacramento, he's welcome to come on the show anytime.
All right.
Loomy's in our chatroom says, did you lose a lot of weight during those 10 years playing DDR?
No.
Not now.
I wish I was playing as much DDR as I was back then because that would help.
Absolutely.
DarkSakura.com
That is terrible.
It's not going to be like, surprise, cow brains, or surprise, it's the uterus of a duck, you know, or something like that.
You know what I mean?
Hey, Dan's had a cow brain dinner.
I never heard you complaining when I stuffed cow brains in the uterus of a duck and fried it, okay?
And now I eat double bacon pizzas Which is funny because now I'm mostly vegetarian
I know you're the one that's actually lost the weight since those days.
I know you guys need to stop being vegetarian because I have to eat more meat to compensate.
I'm not vegetarian.
I'm whatever.
I eat meat like once a month.
Alright.
I mean, you know, like cow flesh.
Alright, we'll talk more about all that and that stuff in a future episode next week.
We have skinny raw pictures up there, I guess.
Oh, yeah, Jessica dug up like hecka old pictures on Facebook and found, I gotta see which one she put up there.
Oh, God.
Next week's going to be a fun show.
It's one of me playing Magenta at the Rocky Horror Picture Show, yes.
Thanks, Jessica.
Thanks so much for that.
All right.
You were so gorgeous.
Let's move on.
Let's go back to gaming news and all that fun stuff here.
No, I want to talk more about Robin Address.
No, let's not.
I don't want to give people the wrong impression.
It's Rocky Horror.
It's different.
All right.
Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news, please.
Well, during releases this week, I mentioned that the Gears of War, that'd be funny, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition is going to be coming out.
And, well, what's kind of neat about it is they just announced that the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands, and this pisses me off because I bought most of the download content on its own, will be coming with not only all the download content for Borderlands, but early access to Duke Nukem Forever.
In other words, the demo.
So even more incentive to spend $60 on a game most of you already have.
Exactly.
God, I want that demo.
But you know what though?
Me being me, that demo will leak out and I'll build a download, so I don't care.
Aren't you special?
I am faithful I'm thinking about, I don't know how much I'd like Borderlands But I hear it's like a first person World of Warcraft with guns Borderlands is fun It's like, yeah, it's a first person shooter But it's kind of a little bit of an RPG And there's a lot of, like, you know Looting, I guess So if you like loot It's a little bit like Diablo, I guess I like the phase walker girl She's pretty cool Yes, she is pretty awesome
Hunter, Mordecai, Raven of Death
Actdeft in our chatroom says, damn it, I got Borderlands on Steam for $10 US.
That's why they put it on sale right before all these announcements.
And Jessica's linking more old pictures of me.
She linked this one of me dressed up as Brad for the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Izam in our chatroom.
I hope I said that right.
Izam?
Izam?
Izam?
In our chatroom says, for a second I thought it was What the Buck.
DJ Hero 2 is coming out soon in a couple weeks
DJ Hero 2 Bundles
which, by the way, they are selling the original game by itself in case you want to build your own bundle over here in the U.S.
for another $50, which is kind of a ripoff if you ask me.
I believe, though, if you preorder through Toys R Us, which no one's really doing that anymore because Toys R Us is almost out of business.
That's my
I thought it was supposed to be a cheap place to get diapers.
There is no cheap place to get diapers.
But I think if you pre-order there, you also get a free copy of the game.
So it might be something to keep in mind.
And then last but not least, with the release of the new Mario Anniversary Edition, which, by the way, is just Mario All-Stars, but on the Wii now.
Not with extra Mario games or anything, right?
No, not with anything.
A port of the Super Nintendo.
A straight-ass port of the Nintendo game.
And it's not even the one that comes with Mario World, is it?
You know, something that they could have, I don't know, put on Virtual Console...
for like $10.
Well, maybe that's what they'll do here in the U.S.
because we haven't heard anything about this coming to the U.S., right?
Oh, it'll come to the U.S.
I guarantee it.
If they can charge $50 for something that's really worth $10, yeah, they'll bring it out over here.
But seriously, Nintendo, we've gotten into this conversation about how Nintendo doesn't really... They do make new stuff now, but a lot of the stuff that they put out, like, hey, look, new Mario game.
It's not really new.
It's just...
and many more.
DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, great, now you're making me feel awful because I want this so bad.
You are an awful person if you want this so bad.
Stop it.
Stop it.
They didn't even change the color of the light in the front.
I mean, you can change that to like red or something, you know?
It's a collector's thing.
I don't know.
It's stupid.
What if he doesn't have a Wii?
I think it should have a Mario graphic on it.
Yeah, it should have at least a Mario.
They should put something, silkscreen some fucking shit on there.
We want stickers.
Pimp my Wii.
Pimp my Wii.
Ew.
Ew.
Alright, so Loki will not be pre-ordering one of these.
No, why would I want... Yeah, let me import a console from Japan, even though I have a Wii already that I don't play anything on, and then, you know, ooh, it's in a wonderful red color that I really don't like.
That's awesome.
Totally gonna put down four.
Thanks for watching!
Gears of War 3 is going to be coming out in the fall of 2011 so the beta will be out sometime in the spring maybe they haven't said exactly when next year they've just said next year there will be a beta so you guys can completely base your judgments of the game off a beta because it's what a lot of people do
LittleBigPlanet 2 also delayed until next year.
Maybe not as late next year.
I think I'm hearing it's just going to be January.
They are not going to actually release it this year in time for the holidays.
And the reason why, they don't want launch day passes.
Patches?
Patches.
Did I say patches?
Patches.
Quote, we could have shipped it and it would have been fine.
And this is a quote from the head of Media Molecule, Alex Evans.
However, we realized that with just a couple extra weeks we could make the game super amazing, adding the super onto the already amazing which exists today.
This is something that will live forever and the delay people will forget about.
I kind of like that he says that because that's a point we've brought up on the show before.
People don't forget.
oftentimes that these games were delayed if they were that good like for example Mario Brothers Melee Super Smash Brothers Melee or whatever the one on the Wii I was delayed like five times and people kind of just forgot by the time the game actually came out you know what though I'm saying this is a good thing this is a good deal if it keeps the game in good quality just like some of these other delays we've been hearing about it's very interesting though that always at the end of the year delay delay delay
It's great that they're putting it out so that we don't have any day one patches because those people that don't have their PlayStations connected to the PlayStation Network anymore because of USB devices that they're using with their PlayStation 3.
And one more for me.
This is about a new Shenmue game.
That's right.
There is a new Shenmue game coming out.
It's coming out in Japan this year.
Shenmue Town is coming out on Yahoo Japan.
DarkSakura, no frumping over there.
But sorry, it's not the game you were hoping I was going to mention here on the show.
SadTuba Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
Stuff and things.
How about Mega Man stuff?
There's going to be a comic out.
It's being put out by Archie Comics.
And they are saying it's going to be faithful to continuity, so hopefully.
Then again, they also did that Sonic the Hedgehog one that I didn't think was very good, nor the Knights one wasn't good at all.
But it is written by Ian Flynn, who's currently writing Sonic the Hedgehog.
Yeah, I don't really have high hopes for it.
The art looks interesting.
I mean, Proto Man looks really freaking cool, but I don't know.
It might be okay.
We'll see when it comes out.
And in other news, Typing of the Dead.
There's going to be a new version!
Yay!
It's Typing of the Dead featuring Mina no Shuko...
It would be helpful if I could pronounce this properly.
Featuring Mina no Shushoku Katsudoniki, which is pretty much the Dreamcast version with new words.
Except these look like they're... It says, Everyone's Job Hunting Diary.
So it's a job hunting site in Japan?
Yeah.
That they've teamed up with Interesting So it's like If they were to make a game These are mini games These are mini games in job hunting mode So you can type in words like Disability income And stagnant air Interesting, huh?
these people never get a job if they're just playing games all the time and last but not least is more Marvel vs. Capcom 3 stuff we have new characters we have Sir Arthur and Nathan Spencer Arthur being from Ghosts and Goblins which we talked about in part A and Nathan Spencer is from the 3D one I'm trying to see what this is
Hold on.
Yeah.
That sucks.
I'm happy about Arthur being in it.
That's pretty cool.
And we're also supposed to hear more characters later on.
So that's pretty neat.
I've already heard about the people I care about.
That's it.
Alright, looking at Twitter, we're going to go to Twitter.
Actually, real quick, I wanted to mention this because Jessica's in our chat room tonight.
She's going to be here on the show next week.
She's plugging one of the other hosts on Understation Live, Bress Lowell.
I believe this is part of Extra Life.
I was participating, playing some video games over the next 24 hours.
I'm sorry, not the next 24 hours, but on the 16th and 17th.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and donate to somebody.
Even if it's not Brestle, donate to somebody.
It's a good cause and gives gamers a good name.
It's a good fuzzy-wuzzy thing to talk about.
I was going to say, also, there was a couple other characters that they added to Marvel vs. Capcom.
Oh, what's that?
On top of... Please share.
Yes, please.
Magneto.
Cool.
The last one was because I'm not recognizing the character.
MODOK.
You ever see the big giant head thing that's just a little harness?
That's MODOK.
But what's MODOK from?
From various Marvel comics.
Really annoying character.
It's like
I forgot what MODOK stands for.
Hold on.
Can I go to Twitter topics?
Tweets time?
Tweeters?
Oh, found it.
Mental organism designed only for killing.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
It's you in a nutshell, says Loki.
Alright, going to our Twitter and looking at some of the topics.
Not a whole lot tonight, but we will get through some of these here.
Um...
Yeah, see, this first one here from PopOnJair, or as I like to read his name, PopOnJair.
It's the Popo.
PopOnJair submits us, Surely you've seen this, the most useless game accessory ever, and it's the game boat.
I remember seeing that on the Twitter.
And I just love the picture, because it's like the dude, he's on a boat!
But yeah, it looks completely useless.
About as useless as that inflatable cart that I still kind of want.
The one that's coming out this week?
Yes.
MNZiba sends us a tweet.
Nintendogs blamed for an actual dog attack.
How in the hell does this work?
Yes.
Let's see.
According to the Daily Mail, this is in the UK, Megan Walker was peacefully playing a copy of Nintendogs at a friend's house when one of the in-game dogs barked at her.
But the bark was an earshot of the friend's bull mastiff, a breed of dog that weighs about 130 pounds.
The sound spooked the dog so much that it bit Walker's face, severing a portion of her upper lip.
How sad.
The girl's grandma told the Daily Mail, I think this game should carry some kind of warning.
People should be told not to play it when there are dogs in the room.
I blame the game for what happened to Megan.
Megan will eat your face.
If they hadn't been playing it, I don't think the dog would have gone for it.
You know, lady...
Maybe you shouldn't keep a 130 pound dog near a 9 year old.
Call it a hunch.
Just a thought.
Or one that's prone to eating people's faces off.
Just thinking.
If you have a face eating dog, you might want to keep it away from your 9 year old.
If I'm right, I think a bull mastiff is the largest breed of dog.
Good God.
They're huge.
Crazy lady.
I was bit by a dog when I was five.
It's not fun.
You're afraid of dogs now.
I am, actually.
I'm getting better.
I used to be afraid of all dogs, but now it's just big dogs.
If I was around a 130-pound dog, I'd be running the other way.
I'm not even going to lie.
But now I'm at the point where Alan has talked me into getting a corgi someday.
Corgis are adorable.
And they're little, and they're cute, and they waggle, and that's adorable.
They're super cute.
But I'm mostly a kitty person.
Blue Swim is tweeting us Namco Bandai will be releasing the first Sailor Moon game on the Nintendo DS by year's end
in Italy.
No other details yet.
It will be the first new Sailor Moon game since the series was relaunched internationally early this year.
So get your Sailor Moon on.
Let's see.
Spazinator is saying, I'm doing all I can to promote OLR on Facebook, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.
Hopefully it'll get you more listeners.
You, sir, get a gold star.
Thank you.
That's all we ask is to help get the word out about OLR.
But, of course, I need to say this.
Not that I'm saying Spazinator is doing this, but just remember, guys, don't spam.
You don't have to spam people because that just makes us look bad.
Just saying.
Tasselhoff sends us a tweet.
Hey, OLR!
I like it when people spell hey, H-A-Y.
Hey!
Hey, O-L-R, what was a scene in a video game that made you shed a tear or cry because of the scene?
Oh, we were talking about this on Warcraft the other night on Vent.
Games that made you cry, that they were so sad.
I probably cried like twice during Lost Odyssey, and I didn't even beat the game.
But just the end of the first disc especially was very, very sad.
DarkSakura.com
A couple.
At least a few puzzle games.
And playing X-Men vs. Street Fighter with Dan because I'd get so pissed off at him that I'd cry.
I can admit it.
Nice.
Alright, moving on to some other tweets Oh, we've been getting this from a couple people actually Aki Ripper sends us a tweet Bejeweled is free at the moment at PopCap.com That's right, that's only for about another, what, two hours?
So sadly, too late for the podcasties But if you're listening to this now, you can get Bejeweled 2 free I gotta be honest though
I mean, how many of you don't already own Bejeweled 2 in one way or another?
I didn't.
Really?
You can play it online for free.
You always could.
I wasn't interested, but I like free shit.
What if I got the iPhone 1?
No, I had it on my old-ass phone back in the day.
I have it on the iPhone and the Xbox 360.
So I appreciate that they're giving away a free game, but it's a 10-year-old game, you guys.
No, but hey, free games are free games.
I just feel like I'm being a digital hoarder if I download that.
All right.
Spazinator PSN says, FYI, in Holmes Theater, there's an episode of Inuyasha streaming for free.
Oh, that's kind of neat that they're using the theater to stream free, like, quote unquote, real things and not just the in-house Sony stuff like the tester or whatever.
That's kind of cool.
I think they should do more of that in Sony Home.
Actdeft says Kirby's Epic Yarn was supposed to be a new IP for Nintendo.
So originally, I guess this wasn't even going to be a Kirby game.
That's kind of neat.
He's actually linking us to a story here.
I guess Iwata made some comments on this.
Originally, let's see.
It was revealed that Kirby was not going to be in the game and the original character going by the name of Fluff could have been the main character with the game carrying the title World of Yarn instead.
Which is funny given the other article that said that it was inspired by a Kirby commercial that they did in Japan in the mid-90s.
Interesting.
Let's see.
TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets and I don't remember either of these being on our show roll so I'll go ahead and mention both these stories real quick.
Again, from TigerClaw on Twitter.
Nintendo patent shows the Wii Vitality Sensor game example so I guess the patent leaked out and it kind of shows how this thing works let's see the Vitality Sensor measures a player's relax fluid sounds kind of gross it's just one of the examples of the game
Thank you for watching.
The character automatically moves as the screen scrolls to the right.
When you inhale, you fire a smiling blob's hat up towards the ceiling.
It drops when you exhale.
This game uses the vitality sensor to identify inhales and exhales.
Interesting, but again, I don't see how this is going to... They'll make a WarioWare game out of this and that's it.
You know what I mean?
There's always a WarioWare game for the peripheral.
Then it'll be done.
Also, and I remember reading about this too, and this is always sad to hear about layoffs, but Microsoft's in-game ad unit apparently is shutting down this month.
And this is a report in an ad industry trade publication, Adweek, citing sources close to the company and insiders at Microsoft stating that massive general manager JJ Richards is now seeking new employment and other unit members have been reassigned throughout the company.
So I guess only one person got laid off.
So I guess that's good that they were able to be redistributed.
Microsoft apparently had been shopping around a massive buyout in the past few months.
What this all boils down to though, I guess it's conflicts with the Xbox Live team because the Xbox Live team sells the ads directly on the Xbox dashboard and doesn't really want the competition with the in-game ads.
So there it goes.
Bye.
There you go.
That's our twits, tweets, twats for tonight.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Thank you guys for your tweets.
We'll see you next week on the Twitter.
In the meantime, I'm going to have to go back and wake up Loki from his iPhone game.
I'm awake.
Hi.
I was playing Climber.
It's awesome.
Is that like Crazy Climber?
No, it's like if you cross Bionic Commando with a ninja, and it's all climbing really fast.
It's cool.
And it's free.
Free is awesome.
Free is awesome.
So this is kind of neat.
Apparently, AT&T U-verse is going to be offering IPTV, I guess, or streaming TV, coming to your Xbox 360.
And this is coming in November.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So you will be able to, I guess, stream TV to it.
It says it must have at least one standard receiver or DVR in order for the Xbox as a set-top box to work.
And it says new fields will be displayed on the TV receiver section, blah, blah, blah.
Xbox connection kit will include an installation CD remote and dongle.
Dongle!
Ah!
Yes, and so I guess it's going to be coming very soon.
And I guess with the new dashboard, they'll be coming out probably very soon as well.
So that's kind of neat.
Wish I had ATT U-verse because Comcast sucks.
But I don't have that option right now.
Well, I guess that's cool.
I don't know, though.
It seems like with all these Apple TVs and Netflix and all this other stuff, this seems to be a couple years late now.
You know what I mean?
When we first heard about it in Europe, it sounded awesome.
Or was it Japan that had this first?
I don't remember.
It sounded awesome.
But now that we have all this other stuff that delivers TV shows, I mean, there's only so many ways you can watch Glee over the internets.
You know what I mean?
Do we really need this one as well?
Ew.
Oh, I forgot you're on the I Hate Glee bandwagon now.
because of the whole Beatles.
No, I was on the I Hate Glee bandwagon before then.
The show just irritates me.
I haven't watched it this season, so I can't say, but I always, in my gut, thought that show was going to be like Heroes.
Awesome first season, not so great in future seasons.
Which one?
Glee.
I haven't really been watching it lately, though.
Glee is like Heroes?
Not that it's plot, but just, you know how Heroes... This week on Heroes, it's...
Gaga Week!
You know how Heroes had an awesome first season and then its second season was like, okay?
It was, yeah.
There was the chick that was like, Maya, that was her name?
She just like single-handedly ruined the show, remember that?
My emo powers!
Exactly.
I sucked life out of you with my emo!
Exactly.
Yeah, that was a terrible season.
And it just went downhill.
Just like an emo to ruin it for everybody.
Nice.
Alright, let's see.
Oh, I wanted to give a quick update real quick because I'm catching up on my private messages.
That whole Extra Life thing I was reading about earlier, Jessica went and got a tiny URL for it.
So this is really easy if you want to participate and help Bress Lowell from Understation Live out.
Just go to tinyurl.com slash Bress Lowell, B-R-E-S-S-L-O-L.
And you can help out.
And I'll put that on the Twitter too, just in case you kids forget.
Okay.
Alright, let's move on though to some other news.
This is about one of my favorite games, Rock Band!
Yay!
Rock Band just hit 2,000 download songs this week.
Actually, that's 2,000 between download and on disc.
But however you count it, it hit its 2,000th song this week.
Potentially 2,000 songs in your Rock Band library.
Yeah, exactly.
Well, and then, does that even count the...
The Rock Band Network or whatever?
I think so.
Oh, does it?
Well, still though.
It's still an impressive number.
Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced was the 2000th song, if you care.
I was curious how many songs they had.
Stop.
By the way, if you're curious how much those have been downloaded, 75 million tracks from the Rock Band Store and the Rock Band Network.
That's a lot of downloads
There you go Bon Jovi coming soon to Rock Band DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
Oh, I've got more stuff.
How about, for those of us who are big fans of Konami's other goings-on before there was DDR, the X-Men arcade game, remember the one that was two-screen, six-player, or one-screen, four-player, is going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
Yes!
I know, right?
Dibs on Storm.
Dude, it was all about playing Dazzler for me.
but it's going to be out guess when?
Soon!
Oh, soon.
Our favorite release date.
It is all about playing Dazzler which is the only game she was ever good in.
I think it's the only game she was in.
So what about the whole six player thing?
Are we going to get to play six players online all at once?
It's going to be epic.
It doesn't say.
I was hearing a rumor about that.
Actually, yes.
They say it will retain six player co-op.
Nice.
Online.
That's right.
New York Comic Con was this weekend, so I'm sure there's a lot of news coming out of that that's comic book related, so that's kind of cool.
I just love this picture from the intro.
It's like Storm just does not give a fuck.
She's not amused.
Storm ain't having it.
No.
She's like... Because she's awesome.
Bitch, please.
TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I bet that game will come out in time for the release of the new X-Men game.
What about the new X-Men movie?
Isn't there a new X-Men movie coming out next year?
What?
Yeah, like it's First Class or something.
It's like a prequel or whatever.
I'll see it.
They recast everybody.
There was a whole comic series called X-Men First Class.
Oh, okay.
All the new original stories from the early days.
Okay.
Could be interesting, I suppose.
But it's going to be hard without Patrick Stewart as Professor X, I'm just saying.
All right, we're not going to do a listless night.
We're going to table that until next week, so let's move on with some more news.
Loki.
Yes, so this is kind of cool.
Apparently, Mega Man Legends is going to be asking people to submit ideas for stuff that they want to see in the game.
They're going to be asking the community to actively participate in different development parts.
Some of the examples that they had on the one page there.
Boss characters, voice actors, ideas.
They want them all.
Of course, that's why Project is in the title.
They said it would be a collaborative experience, but not in the way Mega Man Universe is.
Instead, I guess the community will be able to actively participate in the development of the game.
The Capcom Unity website will be updated with a dev room where fans will be able to submit their gameplay ideas, boss ideas, character ideas, and more.
In the future, fans will be able to vie for position in the game's voice cast.
Pizza Man!
Some of these character designs are really cute, the fan-submitted ones.
Yeah, they don't look bad.
I want to be a voice actor in Mega Man Legends.
Well, what do I sign up?
You just got the sign up on the website.
It's Bunny Girl!
I don't want to be a voice actor for Bunny Girl, sorry.
But yeah, it's kind of cool.
I wonder why all this audience participation in the game?
Is it just a gimmick to try and sell more copies?
Or do you think they just really want fresh ideas?
Or what do you think is the motivation behind this?
I'm not sure.
Probably just more of the...
Meta stuff because everybody likes being able to contribute to a game and having their credit and stuff.
It's way better than having a name on the form for purchasing.
It's that whole web 2.0 kind of stuff.
That makes sense.
All right.
That way fans can't bitch if the game sucks.
Because you made it.
It's all your fault the game got bad reviews.
All right.
I think this is kind of strange.
You know how there's the Kindle, right?
And I think, DarkSakura, you use the Kindle, right?
I use the Kindle app on my phone.
Is that just the same thing as the Kindle?
I don't know.
Well, the Kindle itself is the device that Amazon sells.
You know, the large one.
It's got internet access and shit.
Right.
I just have the app for it on my phone so I can read books.
Oh, okay.
Can't you use iBooks for that?
Not for books I bought through the Kindle store.
Ah, got it.
Okay.
Well, anyhow.
I bought some of my school books that way.
So I can carry them around on my iPhone.
Got it.
All right.
Well, anyhow.
Kindle is, of course, you know, it's a device that, you know, most usually you read books on it.
But now, apparently, there's some games showing up on Kindle.
I guess Scrabble is on Kindle right now.
I didn't even know that.
But, yeah, Scrabble actually made its way to the top of the Kindle charts.
But apparently some folks have ported Zork 1, Zork 2, Zork 3, and Mini Zork to the Kindle.
I didn't even know there was a Mini Zork.
But yeah, Zork 1, Zork 2, and Zork 3 are now all out on the Kindle.
That's kind of awesome.
Now, I don't think the Kindle has too much in the way of a keyboard, so I'm not sure how awesome this is.
I mean, I think it has some keyboard, but it's kind of small.
So I don't know how much fun this is to play.
But yeah, it's out there, and so you are standing in front of a white mailbox.
Don't get eaten by a Gru.
You can experience it all over again.
There it is.
Let's go to the mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we're going to open up ye olde mailbag.
Dive in.
Read the one email.
One email.
One.
One email.
But it's fantastic.
Well, to be fair, I failed on getting the show up on time, so we'll probably have double the emails next week.
Sorry, I was sick.
Leave me alone.
He brought me pita chips.
I sure did.
And a soda.
Hey, OLR crew.
AZHP here.
If you may recall, Rob had mentioned a few episodes ago that Pooping would be a funny name for a social networking site for people on the toilet.
That's right, because of Ping.com, remember?
I'm sorry, Apple's Ping.
Well, I decided to run with that idea, and I'm moderately proud to bring you www.poo-ping.com.
Wow.
I whipped it together over about two weeks.
Since I work a full-time job, I was only able to put an hour or two a day into it.
Its goal is to be like Yelp for public restrooms, though a number of factors prevent me from devoting much time to it.
The aforementioned full-time job and my lack of any sort of prowess related to design.
I don't know.
So it's not too well polished.
Maybe if I find myself unemployed in the future or if you hire Jamie, I can get back to it or she can make it look pretty.
I appreciate if the crew or the chat could throw out some ideas that you would like to see on the site, such as an iPhone app, Google Map integration, Foursquare-style check-ins, a friends list, Twitter-style updates, experience points-based ranking system for adding restrooms, etc.
I can draw you pictures of poop.
Is that really necessary?
Yes.
Who knows?
I might one day implement them.
Anyway, hope you enjoyed it as bare-bones as it is.
Your friendly neighborhood programmer, AZHP.
That's pretty amazing.
I'm looking at the site, poo-ping.com.
Put my bathroom on it.
There it is.
The site for picky poopers.
There it is.
It's actually there.
And there's already one review on there for Next Tag.
And it just talks about where there's four stalls, apparently, and there's paper towels as the hand-drying mechanism and the faucet type.
And you can actually write a review there and talk all about it.
and the comment on this restroom the faucet on the left doesn't shut off all the way unless you push down on it harder restroom is fairly clean and paper towels and toilet paper get restocked often I'm going to review the toilet at Outback I was going to say I should review the bathroom at Jack in the Box that I was at before the show tonight because when I turned on the sink it was so it was like on full blast I got shot with water and it just looked like I crapped my pants like the front of my pants and I was so mad so I was going to write a nasty review of the sink there
I love when our show inspires these ideas.
That's the ultimate tribute.
Thank you guys so much.
So Salacious Pop is saying he just thought of a mailbag for you.
He didn't send this in the email, but I think this is a great question, and I can't wait to hear the rants this inspires.
DarkSakura, have you seen the new Gap logo, and do you feel the logo would be helped by Comic Sans or Papyrus?
What the fuck?
Let me look at it.
Their logo is pretty weak.
Have you not seen the new Gap logo?
It's like crap.
They need a logo right now.
It's all this new controversy.
No, just go to Gap.com.
I'm going.
And you can see it.
And it's... There's their new logo.
It's in Helvetica.
Yeah.
That's it.
No, that's not Helvetica.
Yeah, it is.
It's Gap with a box.
I like it.
Really?
Because, like, all these designers everywhere are pissed.
They have, like, way better designs.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's...
I like the old one better, but this isn't bad.
The old one just was better.
It was more iconic.
I think the square is retarded.
Yeah, I don't know.
It's not really... No, the old one was better.
Poo-Ping.com
This is what I will say about this, if I may.
What?
If this was the first time they'd ever done a logo, as in if they hadn't had that nice one they had before, this would be fine.
Why did they feel they needed to change their logo in the first place?
It's too Swiss.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It looks like... What's that tax place?
H&R Block?
Yeah, it looks like H&R Block.
You knew that.
They changed their font from Futura.
Who did?
Ikea.
Oh, really?
They based it off of a different one.
Theirs was like a super wide version of Futura.
I like that font.
It was pretty, but they changed it.
I don't know.
It's just... Keep in mind, I love Helvetica.
A lot.
This just...
Did you see the movie?
Yes, I have.
I have a copy.
All right.
I have the book.
I'm not joking.
Is it all printed in Helvetica?
Yes, it's called Helvetica, Homage to a Tight Face.
I'll go get it.
No, it's all right.
I don't care.
No one care.
All right.
I was going to put it on the pictures.
All right, fine.
You can take a picture and all that.
We've got to get into the FUs of the week, though.
This is the part of the show where we get really angsty and get mad and throw things.
A few to my cat's butt for being too fat to lift onto her toilet box, her litter box, and pee pee in it properly.
And it's mostly my fault.
I should have exercised my cat more.
But she only is able to pee in about half of the box And the rest of the pee will get on the floor For the record, Shermie's bathroom is in the bathroom closet And we have the bottom part of the door sawed off So she can just climb under there and do her business in private But she misses the box, so the pee goes under her box And that means I have to lift her box and clean it Which is really disgusting But she has not pooped during the show
That's great!
Somebody linked us in the chatroom.
I guess there's this website where you can generate your own Gap logo and someone made OLR.
There it is.
I can do that in two seconds in Photoshop.
Nice.
That was Laser123454321.
Send that.
Alright, Loki, you have a nephew of the week.
A nephew of the week who the cats live in my backyard because they are pooping everywhere.
And it smells like poop everywhere.
And they need to leave the premise.
Is that it?
Need to leave the premise of the premises.
whatever if that's it then my FU of the week I have a few, FU to me being sick because it sucked and I've been sleeping like 12 and 13 hours this weekend which is sad because I'm not going to get to see Alan next weekend so it kind of sucks that I spent this whole weekend sleeping so yeah, boo to that boo to the fact that Midway Mania was closed to California Adventure when I went this last time so I'm very upset about that because I wanted to take Alan on that and I couldn't
But yay to us going on Tower of Terror.
That made me very happy.
No, that ride's great.
I'm glad you think so.
Let's see.
And then my last FU goes to the baggage handler at JetBlue, who I guess threw my bag.
Or either that or the people who designed my bag.
Because my laptop kind of fell out of the laptop part of my bag and into the main part of my bag.
And as it was being slung around, I now have a line of dead pixels on my monitor.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Yay!
I remembered one more FU that I had.
FU to Windows 7 for whatever reason, removing the What You Hear feature on the recording options on your sound card.
You know, that has been the main holdup for why Xfer and I can't do a podcast right now.
We can't figure out how to make it work.
For some reason, it works here.
Oh, we're on XP here, that's why.
You know how you do it?
How?
It's sad.
You have to do from speaker out to line in.
Oh, yeah.
No, thanks.
That sucks.
Or they say get a secondary USB sound card or something.
I've actually been looking into that.
Yeah.
Come on.
Maybe you can help me figure out why my mic isn't working for Ventrilo.
Might be similar.
I don't know why you would even remove that feature.
It's stupid.
Yeah, it sucks.
It depends.
Also, I thought it was always a Sound Blaster feature, like if you had a Sound Blaster.
Well, I have a non-Sound Blaster card in my laptop here, and I can record what I hear.
It's just, it's not, you just record it.
No, Xfer and I ran a test run the other week where we were going to and we couldn't get his Skype thing to record.
And I tried everything we do here in studio to make the show work and it wouldn't work over there.
Of course, we use an external mixing board too, which I'm sure helps, but it's just irritating.
So we'll try again.
Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.
We're gonna get to your phone calls soon, not just yet, but very soon.
In the meantime, though, we got just a couple quick stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Yes, it's interesting.
You know, Sam Raimi is working on a Earth Defense Force movie.
Now, obviously, this is not anything to do with D3 game, Earth Defense Force, the greatest game on Earth.
But it is, you know, something where, you know, apparently...
Aliens are invading and the Earth Defense Force has to, you know, stop them from invading or whatnot.
The details of the movie are very rough right now.
Here's the interesting part, though, and I'm not sure if Sam Raimi's aware of this, but apparently Earth Defense Force is actually a copyrighted name by D3, so...
EDF follows a US military unit that has been deployed to rescue a sub that has accidentally run afoul in Chinese waters.
Apparently a dogfight ensues, but both the Chinese and American planes are shot out of the water by three alien spacecrafts.
They go on to destroy landmarks and key military structures.
It's a race against the clock as humans try to create weaponry and vehicles that can sustain another attack.
Just make a goddamn fucking Earth Defense Force movie based off Earth Defense Force the game.
Well, they were going to call it The Last Airbender, but unfortunately that was taken too.
My rating is up on pooping.com.
Nice.
For the Outback Statehouse.
Bathroom.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's going to have 3D breast wobbling.
That's right.
A whole new breast physics mechanic thing for the 3DS.
So you can see those titties titillating in full 3D.
That's just great.
I bet you guys are very excited about that.
I am.
Is this a day one purchase for you?
No.
No.
Okay.
Trust me, I don't need to purchase a game to see boobs bouncing.
I see.
You could just ask the wife.
Or just, I don't know, access the internet.
Or go outside.
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We are open for business on the Skype line if you want to say hello.
You all right?
Your chair sounded like a horn went off or something.
Is that my chair?
That was me.
Oh, that was you?
That was me.
Oh.
I'm going to crap load or something.
It sounded like a bicycle horn.
That was funny.
Okay, so last minute story.
I guess, yeah, while we wait for calls, sure.
My butt.
DarkSakura's having too much fun with that crap logo site that Laser1234531 linked us.
Yes.
So I know there's other things we can talk about here.
And let's see if our website will actually pull up my story.
Oh, well, boo-hoo.
Boo!
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Link.
Alright, for the Democrats, at the Press A to Start screen, if you enter left 13 times, followed by the plus, you should be able to unlock them.
For the Republicans, if you press on the same screen right 13 times, followed by the plus, you will unlock them.
That's funny.
I get it, because the Democrats are on the left and the Republicans are on the right.
What if you're moderate?
Then you press down 13 times?
I don't know.
What happens if you push down 13 times?
The game crashes.
No, I don't know.
And you push nothing.
Nothing happens, because that's what happens.
Down is the tea party.
I get it.
All right.
By the way, Laser12345321 is yelling at me in chat saying, just say Laser.
We had this problem before.
I don't like just Laser.
Don't put all those numbers in your name.
I like Laser12345321.
It gives it class.
Just saying.
Change your name to Laser321contact.
It's even better.
That's even better.
I like that.
Laser321contact.
I like that.
Now I'm thinking of the 3-2-1 contact from Electric Company, but that's a whole different scenario altogether.
That's right, now it's stuck in your head.
Yes, definitely.
But no, but these two were probably one of the hardest ones for a bit, but I don't know how somebody came across it, but I was reading a few websites and somebody posted on there of how to do this, so that was quite interesting.
Because for a while they were like, here's the code to unlock...
Unlock the BC Boys.
Here's the code to unlock the ESPN.
And the rest of the stuff, you pretty much are on your own to unlock.
Well, and those codes are very easy to remember, actually.
Left 13 times.
That's not very hard to remember.
Or right 13 times.
That's not hard to remember.
That's like something I did by a fluke.
Like, oh, let me hit left and see what happens.
And then, like, all of a sudden, you know, you hit the button and it happened.
You know, you hit your chime.
And it's like, okay, what did I unlock?
Oh, look, I just unlocked, you know.
And to unlock NBA Elite, you smash the remote against the ground 13 times.
Our track to death can happen.
You can throw it out the window.
Yeah, I was going to say, it's not like any of us have bought NBA Jam yet.
I don't know.
Maybe there's a few Wii people that have bought it so far, but I sure haven't yet.
You know what?
To be honest, I was going to buy it, and then I saw the $50 price tag, and that really turned me off.
I'm like, why the hell would I pay $50 for a just updated version of the game that came out so long ago?
NBA Jam is fucking rad.
It was going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
Oh, I freaking loved it.
I loved playing in Arcade.
I remember playing all the time, going through all the teams and trying to... As soon as I beat one team with all the teams to go, you know, and it was like a weekly thing.
It was like NFL Blitz.
It did the same thing growing up with NFL Blitz.
You start with one team, you go through, and then you try...
because you're always trying to compete with everybody else in your local arcade to try to be that top number one spot.
So I wish they would have done something like that, but unfortunately, they don't have the capability of online to keep global stats of that sort, which kind of ruins it.
I mean, especially if you play just single player.
You've got to admit, though, you've got to play the Obama versus Palin.
You know you want to play that and then accuse the game of being biased.
You know you want to do that.
If the computer cheats, yes.
What do you think about Cataclysm coming out pretty soon?
And the new patch?
and DarkSakura.com.
Yeah, if it's true that the patch is hitting this week, which most people seem to kind of agree it is, it's going to be a game changer.
So we'll see.
But, you know, they always do these major patches right before.
So it'll be interesting.
Two little things real quick.
Thank you for turning me on to the game next week.
Unfortunately, I wish I got on a week before, but fortunately next week would be my one-year anniversary on WoW.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, that's really bizarre.
I was looking that up.
I was kind of curious.
And I knew it was actually next week.
Because I remember it got in before the new holiday coming up.
And it's my TDR version next week.
So it was almost the same time.
Yeah, two, get on your three games.
And three, Jamie, what are you planning on playing after you get done with Planes vs. Zombies since you've been addicted to it?
Like what game?
Yeah, what game is next for you after this?
I'm still playing Star Trek Online and Final Fantasy XIII.
So, I've got stuff on my plate.
Stuff I'm playing at the same time.
I'm still playing Sims 3.
Gotcha.
Yep.
Alright.
Well, excellent.
Before I let you go, I just got one message for you.
What?
Hold on.
Here we go.
Can you hear it?
It's really quiet.
Yeah, it's funny.
Now it's stuck in your head for the rest of the day.
Very much, yes.
There you go.
It's very much a demonic pizza song.
Contact is the moment when everything happens.
Contact.
All right, that's it.
All right, have a good one.
Bye.
You too.
Bye-bye.
What was it?
I think it was 321 Contact.
What was it?
The detective show or something that was part of that show that they had math stuff?
You're thinking of MathNet from Square One TV.
Oh, MathNet.
You're thinking of MathNet.
Oh, my God.
I'm not even going to play.
It used to be all about MathNet.
That show was awesome.
It was awesome.
And then Friday was the all MathNet show.
Square One is pretty cool.
I kind of miss the old shows.
If you want to give us a call and stop us from playing retro TV songs, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's see, they have actually all these episodes of MathNet.
That's awesome.
I'm going to assume probably one of these.
MathNet, frankly.
Hello, Walter.
Really?
Are you sure?
Okay, we'll be right there.
Dude, you know what would be awesome?
The new Law & Order series.
Law & Order MathNet.
That would be so awesome.
This week on Law & Order, somebody divides by zero.
Juju Rockets Headed for the iPad
Dead Rising Mobile Capcom Arcade
which will host a bunch of virtual arcade cabinets that require the purchase of tokens to play the games.
Interesting.
Otherwise, you can permanently access each game for a larger one-time fee.
The arcade service will launch before Dead Rising Mobile and will feature Street Fighter 2, Ghouls and Ghosts, 1942, and Commando.
So this is why no one else wants to get on board with Game Room because now they're like, well, let's just do our own shit.
Exactly.
Oh no.
Another full motion video game is coming to the App Store as well.
This one is kind of a neat one.
I remember drawing some of the characters from it.
Braindead 13 is coming as well to the App Store very soon.
Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Super Monkey Ball, and Phantasy Star 2 are all discounted on iTunes right now.
You can get those all for about $1.99 instead of $6 each.
But they suck on the iPhone.
I'm not going to mince words.
Super Monkey Ball is not bad.
Okay, I'll give you that But these other ones, honestly If you have a 360 or a PS3 Go get that Genesis collection The Sonic Mega Genesis collection It's like in the bargain bin right now You can probably find it for $10 And it's fantastic And it's like the greatest $10 you'll spend If you like the retro stuff If you don't like the retro stuff, then don't bother
But otherwise, if that last story sounded interesting to you and you own a 360 or a PS3, go buy the Mega Genesis Collection.
It's a much better deal.
Trust me.
And then Minecraft is being updated for Halloween.
They're adding new months.
Seriously, I leave the show for two weeks and suddenly, just in general, gaming news in general, suddenly I come back and it's like, Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft.
Everybody's talking about Minecraft.
I'm just covering what people want to know.
Anyways, it's going to include some new monsters.
Apparently, torches that extinguish over time, fishing, and the ability to fast travel by moving through, I guess, a hell world.
And the craftable wristwatch.
They'll let players track how much time is left in the day before the bad guys come out.
877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR
Damn it, people, call us!
I didn't have the light red.
That's the thing.
I had that more rare red color.
Good times.
877-GAME-OLRR Use name on Skype is Orange Laundry.
Isn't it weird to think that everything you're seeing there, that theater that you're seeing all those pictures in, that's now the parking lot for the Best Buy.
You park your cars there now.
It's sad.
And then they have something else that they're building that looks like a theater.
It's a sports authority store.
Ah, lame.
That's the same reaction I had.
No one wants to go to the sports authority.
It's the same reaction I had.
Was Travis Columbia?
In that particular night, yes.
That's fantastic.
That particular night was the switch night or tacky horror, they sometimes call it, where the guys play girl parts and the girls play guy parts.
That's why there's pictures of me as Magenta.
You played a good Magenta.
Magenta is my favorite character in the whole movie.
we did some awesome theme nights good times Jess will be here next week we can reminisce about this shit all night we can do another marathon show just out of that I was a rope that was the cast after Under Station you were kind of helping out after the theater was torn down it was Further Indignities was the name of that crowd and remember I got Dr. Scott once
That's right, you did Jessica's in chat saying we need to go do the time warp in the parking lot on February 3rd Because that'll be 10 years since the theater shut down Did you ever pick up that game, was it the Broadway something or other?
The one that's just dance but with all the Broadway songs?
Not until it's in the $5 bin, come on, let's be honest It's gotta be in the $5 bin now I'll have to look
I don't know.
It came out back in June.
I can't imagine that I've sold a copy of it since.
I guess that's it.
We're not getting any of the calls tonight.
Damn it, people.
What's wrong with you?
Everybody's being shy.
Call.
I guess that's it.
I'm going to shut it down in a minute.
I'm going to give it another minute.
Shut it down.
Shut it down.
You all fail.
Dan's in the other room going, terminated.
Was Dan on the show last week?
Did he help you kids out?
No.
Oh, he wasn't.
No.
He ran...
Dan, you want to come be on the show?
No.
No, he says no.
How rude.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Call 1-8... Call...
Go on iTunes and leave a nice review for us.
Leave us an 8.
Leave us an 8 out of 5 star review on iTunes.
Just tell a couple friends about the show.
Help spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.
It's just some nerds who do this for fun, who've been doing this way too long.
In a good way.
Anyhow, before we pull the plug on the show, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
Loki, start us off tonight.
Your final thought.
My final thought is I am looking forward to getting my new laptop so I can finish my mods for Grand Theft Auto 4.
I am very disappointed that I ran into two people trying to rip me off in auctions and in purchases.
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
I want ice cream.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm on ice cream.
Okay.
Let's go to Baskin Robbins.
That's fine.
All right.
That's it.
We're done.
We're out.
Pulling the plug.
We will see you here next week for episode 386.
It's going to be very special.
Kind of look back on 10 years of DDR for me and Iguana Girl, Jessica Harper, whatever other name she has.
I'm trying to think about when my 10th anniversary was.
You played before me.
I know that.
Yeah.
And Loki, I think, started playing a little later, right?
So...
I started playing it was after Fanime one of those years.
But that's early in the year.
God, I don't remember when I started playing.
Because I had gotten a fourth mix.
I imported a fourth mix.
My first machine was an AX2001 at Disneyland.
That's not too far off then, your first machine.
But my first time playing DDR was in December of 99.
Well, regardless... No, not 99, because I had...
Yeah, December 99.
Technically, my first time seeing DDR was Memorial Day of 99.
No, of 2000.
Yeah.
No, 99.
Because I gave you third mix.
Because that weekend holds other special significance.
I gave you third mix afterwards.
Yes.
After you played Machine.
But regardless, we're going to have a 10-year look back next week just because.
Yay!
So that's it.
Have a great night, everybody.
We'll see you next time.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You need to chastise your boyfriend.
Why?
What did you do?
Sidno Pinkberry.
Lecture, lecture, lecture.
Point, point, point.
Shake, shake, shake.
Let's go to San Francisco and get Naya next weekend.
I have to go to a wedding next weekend.
Speaking of this, it's all Rocky people that are getting married next week.
Is it a Rocky wedding?
It's actually somebody Jessica would know.
I'll have to tell her.
Is it a Rocky wedding?
No, it's not a Rocky themed wedding.
It's a legit wedding.
That's no fun.
Yeah, but I'm going to a wedding next weekend.
So anyway, but I will be here for the show.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I will be here for the show.
I'm sorry, listeners.
I bet you had fun last week, but yes, I'm going to be here.
Can I play the closing credits now?
I guess.
