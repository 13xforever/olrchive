00:00.000 --> 00:21.520
Tonight, October 3, 2010, NBA Jam goes solo on the 360 and PS3, Sonic 4 gets a release

00:21.520 --> 00:32.760
date, and have big titles this year save the PC gaming industry?

00:32.760 --> 00:36.520
Hello everybody, this is episode, what are we on again?

00:36.520 --> 00:37.520
283.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.520
283 of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.520
I'm sorry, 384.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.480
I totally threw a random number there, that's kind of funny, huh?

00:43.480 --> 00:44.480
383.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.480
Yeah, 283.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
We went back in time.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.400
Rob's gone and the show has become the TARDIS and we have run back in time.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.160
We're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.520
I got two of the numbers right though, they were just out of order.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.640
Yes, an O-L-R-G, yes, spazzinator.

00:58.640 --> 01:10.120
I am DarkSakra, Jamie Summers, Rob is on a plane, or dead, and then this is Loki, our

01:10.120 --> 01:11.120
tech master.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.800
Do you do any tech stuff lately with us?

01:15.800 --> 01:21.920
I stole some accord the other day out of the box because I need it for something new and

01:21.920 --> 01:23.800
a home, but other than that, no.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.400
Okay, well that's close enough.

01:26.400 --> 01:32.560
So as always we start the show with how was your gaming week, and I normally go first

01:32.560 --> 01:34.280
but I'm not gonna, so you go first.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.920
Oh, actually, wait, wait, wait, wait, we have one more thing.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.920
One more thing.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
Cough, cough.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
Yes.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.080
Sorry, you're not in the room.

01:41.080 --> 01:46.760
We have a special, special, special co-host tonight, and that's Maren Marvel.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.720
Hi, are you ready to talk video games?

01:50.720 --> 01:55.240
Oh, she broke out the porn voice.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.880
So then why don't we go ahead and start with you for how was your gaming week?

01:59.880 --> 02:02.200
My gaming week was alright.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.840
I played a lot of WoW, I've gotten back into World of Warcraft after not playing for a

02:06.840 --> 02:08.800
long time.

02:08.800 --> 02:14.240
And other than that, pretty uneventful, I played some, I like the music games like The

02:14.240 --> 02:17.640
Lips and The Beatles Rock Band, so I did some of those.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.960
And I've been trying to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years, which came out around

02:21.960 --> 02:27.320
this time last year on the Wii, and I had started playing it and I just like dropped

02:27.320 --> 02:30.800
off the face of the earth, and so I started playing it again.

02:30.800 --> 02:36.440
And now I'm at a point where I'm seriously under-leveled for the area I'm at, so I'm

02:36.440 --> 02:42.720
going to have to go do my least favorite thing, which is grinding and leveling up.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.800
That was always the thing that I could not stand in World of Warcraft, just because it

02:46.800 --> 02:48.360
seemed really monotonous to me.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.080
Yeah, there is that too.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.440
But now I'm playing a warlock, so I've never played a warlock before, usually I play a

02:54.440 --> 02:58.480
priest or a druid, so it's kind of fun and different.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.200
Well it sounds like you're having a good time, and just so that our listeners know a little

03:02.200 --> 03:06.000
bit more about you, would you like to tell them a little bit about yourself?

03:06.000 --> 03:11.920
My name is Tiara, also known as MaronMarvel, I am semi-famous on the interwebs, but not

03:11.920 --> 03:17.360
as famous as Sky and Loki in Dark Sakura.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.400
And we'll make you famous.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.960
Yeah, yay!

03:20.960 --> 03:24.160
This is all sounding very dirty.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.160
We have ways to make you famous.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.040
Now we've got you outnumbered, it's estrogen time.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.440
Yeah, dun dun dun!

03:34.440 --> 03:37.160
It was always estrogen time here with Robs.

03:37.160 --> 03:42.560
He's gonna go back and edit this and go, what?

03:42.560 --> 03:44.360
Although it's the truth.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.880
Okay, well then Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:46.880 --> 03:55.160
I actually didn't play a whole lot, but I did play some stuff on the iPod, and I don't

03:55.160 --> 03:58.240
know, a lot of it was just disappointing, because I go on these binges where I buy a

03:58.240 --> 03:59.240
lot of junk.

03:59.240 --> 04:05.240
Not even necessarily buy a lot of junk, but I download a lot of apps, and that includes

04:05.240 --> 04:07.720
a lot of games, especially stuff that's on sale.

04:07.720 --> 04:15.520
So I went ahead and I downloaded, because it was free, Duke Nukem 3D for the iPod or

04:15.520 --> 04:18.000
iPhone or whatever.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.280
The only problem is I deleted it almost immediately because the controls in it really suck.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.560
Otherwise it's Duke Nukem 3D and it's pretty awesome, but it's just the controls really

04:26.560 --> 04:29.320
suck, so what's the point?

04:29.320 --> 04:33.560
Of course, more Plants vs. Zombies, that was a lot of fun.

04:33.560 --> 04:43.200
I also played a little bit of the newly released Bit.Trip Beat on the iPod, and the only thing

04:43.200 --> 04:47.920
I don't like about that game, and it was kind of the same way when it was on the Wii, where

04:47.920 --> 04:53.880
everything you had to kind of tilt the controller to move your paddle up and down.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.160
Well, you have to tilt the iPod to move your paddle up and down, and I really think it

04:57.160 --> 05:00.640
would have been a lot better if you could just use the touch screen to move your finger

05:00.640 --> 05:01.640
up and down the screen.

05:01.640 --> 05:05.080
It would be a lot more accurate, and it can ramp up the difficulty or something like that

05:05.080 --> 05:11.340
because it's just very awkward for me to tilt the stupid screen.

05:11.340 --> 05:18.080
Then non-iPod stuff, I actually tried the demo for Start the Party, which is one of

05:18.080 --> 05:22.920
the PlayStation Move games, because we had friends over and they wanted to see some of

05:22.920 --> 05:28.680
the Move stuff, and I've got to admit, that game was actually kind of fun, and it kind

05:28.680 --> 05:33.120
of reminds me of the old iToyPlay games, and you might be thinking, oh, iToyPlay, that's

05:33.120 --> 05:34.120
going to be crap.

05:34.120 --> 05:39.760
Well, actually, what's kind of cool about it is the fact that with the camera now and

05:39.760 --> 05:43.440
the motion controllers, you can actually do a lot of the augmented reality stuff.

05:43.440 --> 05:49.140
For example, most of the games actually in that use augmented reality controls, so you'll

05:49.140 --> 05:55.720
have your motion controller that you're holding, and it actually looks like a tennis racket,

05:55.720 --> 06:01.480
and you can move it around in any direction that you want, and it basically looks like

06:01.480 --> 06:08.720
you're holding a tennis racket, and it's very accurate, very fun to play, actually.

06:08.720 --> 06:14.780
They have a lot of, they had a little round in the game where it kind of switches up games

06:14.780 --> 06:18.560
really quick, kind of like WarioWare, and it was actually quite fun.

06:18.560 --> 06:23.320
So I might actually check out the full version of that if, you know, it would be a good party

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
game or something.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.320
That, and of course, more sports champions play a little bit of that demo as well, because

06:28.320 --> 06:33.800
I still haven't actually gone out to buy any full version Move games yet, because I just

06:33.800 --> 06:40.400
don't usually play in the PlayStation 3, because it's in the main room, and the wife likes

06:40.400 --> 06:44.880
to watch TV and stuff, and there's a baby there, so that kind of makes it difficult.

06:44.880 --> 06:50.720
Then of course, more, you know, Grand Theft Auto, that stuff every week.

06:50.720 --> 06:57.640
But yeah, I've got Dead Rising 2 and Halo Reach to get to, though, so eventually I'll

06:57.640 --> 06:58.640
play those.

06:58.640 --> 07:05.440
I'm actually looking forward to playing Dead Rising 2, so yeah, it'll be fun.

07:05.440 --> 07:11.760
That's pretty much all I played this week, yeah, so that's it.

07:11.760 --> 07:16.080
Well, my week was spent with a little Star Trek Online, but I didn't really play a whole

07:16.080 --> 07:17.080
lot.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.920
I've had kind of a weird week, and I spent the first half of it kind of sick.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.600
So I did get on some Plants vs. Zombies.

07:24.600 --> 07:30.600
Rob came over on Tuesday night to record part of the intro, and he was so funny playing

07:30.600 --> 07:38.160
Super Metroid, because he was doing his Samus that sounds awfully like Rob voice, going

07:38.160 --> 07:44.240
ow, well that hurt, and then there's this one part right before you go to fight.

07:44.240 --> 07:53.440
Was it Craig, Ridley, or one of the, Craig, Craig, sorry, I don't know what, I was thinking

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
of school.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.440
Craig?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
Craig.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.440
No, Craig.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.440
That's the wrong game.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.440
Which we did play.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.760
I know, I know it is.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.720
Which we did play, but I'll get to that next.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.380
But there's this one part where this person is dead and covered in bugs, and the bugs

08:07.380 --> 08:11.640
play off, and Rob's like, LOL you're dead, which I thought was funny.

08:11.640 --> 08:18.240
And then Rob left, and we played Turtles in Time on the SNES, and we beat the game, because

08:18.240 --> 08:20.420
Dan and I are an awesome team.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.640
So Shredder did not dine on turtle soup?

08:22.640 --> 08:26.040
No, but he kept talking about it, and I'm like, dude, don't you have any original lines

08:26.040 --> 08:27.500
or something?

08:27.500 --> 08:35.020
And so, yesterday I went to play, just because we had to go ahead and go buy this really

08:35.020 --> 08:42.080
crappy arcade, I stopped to play Para Para Paradise, which is the first mix plus, and

08:42.080 --> 08:43.080
it was pretty fun.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.480
I actually remembered how to do three of them off the top of my head, and did a decent job,

08:47.480 --> 08:52.820
and of course, I had four songs to play, so I just redid Night of Fire, because Night

08:52.820 --> 08:54.520
of Fire is fun.

08:54.520 --> 09:01.200
And then came home, and I've played some Sims, and mostly it's just been little bits of gaming

09:01.200 --> 09:06.340
except for Tuesday night, because I've had school work and other stuff to do, so that's

09:06.340 --> 09:07.780
been my gaming week.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.640
More eventful than usual, but not as, not really all that busy.

09:11.640 --> 09:17.120
My gaming week will be busier soon, once Fable 3 comes out, because I totally pre-ordered

09:17.120 --> 09:20.120
that this weekend.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.120
So you'll be-

09:21.120 --> 09:23.120
Are you going to yell at the dog?

09:23.120 --> 09:26.960
Already for Dance Masters when it comes out, since you've been playing some Para Para,

09:26.960 --> 09:34.120
that's all that game really is anyways, or not Dance Masters, it's uh, no it is Dance

09:34.120 --> 09:35.120
Masters.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.120
Dance Masters, yeah.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.160
That's right, because there's Dance Central is the other one.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.840
I wonder if there's going to be actual Para Para in it.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.840
It is!

09:41.840 --> 09:45.000
That's what the moves are, they're Para Para, they had Night of Fire on there, and it's

09:45.000 --> 09:46.440
exact same thing.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
I'm totally getting this.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.440
Dan, we're getting this.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.440
He's over at my desk.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.120
I do have to get the Kinect though, and that's expensive.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
Yeah, that's true.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.120
But I am getting that.

09:54.120 --> 09:59.560
And I actually probably will pick up this game just for fun, because it's funny.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.560
Dan's over there saying that he's sure that we'll have it.

10:02.560 --> 10:08.560
So as for some general housekeeping, like we've been mentioning, Rob is on a giant cylinder

10:08.560 --> 10:15.960
defying the laws of gravity, although he is making good use of the laws of propulsion

10:15.960 --> 10:19.200
and aerodynamics.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.760
So way to go Rob.

10:20.760 --> 10:25.400
He's probably up there asleep or playing as Game Boy or something.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.240
That being said, Rob will probably not be here the entire episode, or if he's here it

10:29.240 --> 10:33.600
will be towards the end, and I'm not making any promises.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Also um...

10:34.600 --> 10:39.840
Which is why we're going to do this episode really quick so that it doesn't happen.

10:39.840 --> 10:45.440
But we do have the lovely Tiara with us tonight, who is always welcome to be on the show if

10:45.440 --> 10:47.080
she ever gets in town again.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
Yeah, I know.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.720
I gotta save up some vacation time.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
Yeah.

10:52.720 --> 10:57.840
Well, that being said, why don't we hop right into the news head first and get ready for

10:57.840 --> 11:00.160
some decontamination afterwards.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.800
Yes.

11:01.800 --> 11:06.040
So the big news this week, of course, Nintendo had their own little press conference not

11:06.040 --> 11:11.920
to be outdone by Tokyo Game Show, and of course everything Nintendo was covered by.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.560
You're like, bitch, we're Nintendo.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
Exactly.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
They can do whatever they want.

11:15.560 --> 11:21.300
We're not coming to your conference, we have our own conference, and you can't come.

11:21.300 --> 11:25.680
So they talked, of course, the 3DS, because that's going to be the big release for them

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
next year.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.720
Lots of details coming out about it.

11:29.720 --> 11:39.680
Of course, it is going to be coming out in February for a lot of money, unfortunately.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.760
I don't think it's going to exactly be that expensive when it comes out over here, but

11:44.760 --> 11:46.880
over there it is quite expensive.

11:46.880 --> 11:54.200
25,000 yen, which is the equivalent of US, or about 300 US, and it'll be out in aqua

11:54.200 --> 11:59.560
blue and cosmos black.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.560
So that's interesting.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.240
February 26, 2011 is the actual date.

12:04.240 --> 12:09.200
They're saying that the estimates in the other regions, it's supposed to come out around

12:09.200 --> 12:17.320
before the end of the first quarter, so probably during their fiscal year.

12:17.320 --> 12:23.480
So that's coming out then, and some other details, of course, came out about it as well,

12:23.480 --> 12:27.980
since they covered everything.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.280
What it'll actually come with when you buy it.

12:29.280 --> 12:33.120
It's going to have, of course, the AC adapter, but what's kind of neat, though, is it has

12:33.120 --> 12:37.720
a charging stand, so you don't have to buy one of those third-party things, just slap

12:37.720 --> 12:38.880
it right in there.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.720
And by the way, when it's sitting in the charging stand, it kind of looks like a little puppy,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.520
so that's kind of weird with the two cameras on there.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.160
It's a cute little puppy.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.880
Oh, that is cute.

12:48.880 --> 12:58.200
Of course, the touch pen and a 2GB SD card, as well as six augmented reality cards, as

12:58.200 --> 13:00.400
well as instruction booklets and all that fun stuff.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.640
And I guess there's actually going to be a built-in augmented reality game that you can

13:04.640 --> 13:07.300
play using the 3DS cameras.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.000
So that'll be kind of neat.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.400
I wonder if the picked up chat's still in there, because that'd be fun.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.520
And of course, other fun stuff that's going to be available.

13:16.520 --> 13:20.840
You will be able to, of course, download games to the console as well.

13:20.840 --> 13:25.440
They're going to have the ability to import games that you've downloaded from your DSi

13:25.440 --> 13:28.920
or DSi XL into the 3DS.

13:28.920 --> 13:35.080
Also, they're going to have a brand new virtual console that's going to cover Game Boy and

13:35.080 --> 13:37.640
Game Boy Color games.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.080
So that'll be out there at some point.

13:41.080 --> 13:47.580
And other fun things, of course, they're going to be having a web browser that actually works

13:47.580 --> 13:48.580
this time.

13:48.580 --> 13:52.280
It's not just some cheap-ass web browser that they're going to tack on later on.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.320
It's actually going to have Flash support in it, I believe.

13:56.320 --> 14:02.240
And they're going to also have kind of a tag mode as well, where you can walk around and

14:02.240 --> 14:06.360
it'll automatically exchange data with other machines, since you won't have to just manually

14:06.360 --> 14:08.840
turn it on.

14:08.840 --> 14:14.640
And some other things that they're talking about with that is possibly doing firmware

14:14.640 --> 14:17.480
updates using that tag mode.

14:17.480 --> 14:24.200
So kind of a way to make sure everybody's not pirating.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.000
I was reading about that, but it also seems to me, though, that all it would take would

14:29.000 --> 14:30.600
be one simple hardware hack.

14:30.600 --> 14:36.040
Well, you could just also turn it off.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.240
That's really worked well for the PSP.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.240
Yeah.

14:39.240 --> 14:44.680
Well, they don't have any sort of tag mode with the PSP, but you can always turn that

14:44.680 --> 14:46.800
stuff off.

14:46.800 --> 14:51.200
You might want to turn it off, say, if you're playing at home, because that's going to use

14:51.200 --> 14:57.640
up a lot of your battery just with the Wi-Fi on all the time.

14:57.640 --> 15:01.960
So that's what's coming out at least for the 3DS stuff, I'm sure.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.960
The big list of games that they were talking about, I mean, everything that you can imagine.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.220
I think they even had video of a bunch of different things.

15:09.220 --> 15:14.400
The new Zelda remakes, Mario Kart looks awesome.

15:14.400 --> 15:19.920
A lot more games we'll be talking about a little bit later, but very exciting stuff.

15:19.920 --> 15:25.260
Well now, you were saying earlier when Bobby called us that you expected it to have a lower

15:25.260 --> 15:26.260
price point.

15:26.260 --> 15:30.320
Yeah, because it'd be dumb to put it out for $300 over here.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.360
People would buy it though, I think.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.040
I don't think so.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.040
People paid $700 for a PS3.

15:36.040 --> 15:42.800
People are not going to buy a 3DS for $300 when the Wii is, you know, $200.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.360
So that's not going to happen.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.600
It'll be $200 is what it's going to be when it comes out over here, I'm guessing.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.840
That'd be my guess, at least.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.920
I mean, it could be very well $250 or something, but I don't think it's going to be $300.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.280
I think $250 would be reasonable.

15:56.280 --> 16:04.000
But yeah, we'll just have to wait and see when more information comes out about that

16:04.000 --> 16:07.080
stuff and once we get closer to the launch.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.640
It'll be here before you know it.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
Reckon so.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.440
Well, Tara, do you have any news for us?

16:12.440 --> 16:16.360
Yes I do, especially if you like blue hedgehogs, because...

16:16.360 --> 16:17.360
They're crunchy.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.360
Yes.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
Wait, what?

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
Oh.

16:20.360 --> 16:28.720
Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 is coming out this month, and there are going to be a lot

16:28.720 --> 16:32.120
of different release dates for different platforms.

16:32.120 --> 16:39.520
It's coming out on October 7th for iPhone and iPod Touch through the iTunes App Store.

16:39.520 --> 16:45.800
You can also get it through the Wii Shop channel on October 11th for 1,500 Wii Points.

16:45.800 --> 16:53.400
Xbox Live Arcade, it'll be available October 13th for 1,200 Microsoft Points, or $15.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.640
And on October 12th, you can get it on the PlayStation Network for about 13 euros or

16:58.640 --> 17:03.560
10 pounds, which I believe is something like a million dollars US, or $15.

17:03.560 --> 17:08.360
It's $14.99 actually, but our exchange rate kind of sucks.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.920
That's putting it mildly.

17:10.920 --> 17:16.000
I was actually watching video of Sonic 4 in action, and it looks like it's a lot of fun.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.960
I like the updated look to it, but still the cool 2D style play.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.960
It looked fun.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.120
I gotta be honest.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.120
I have this.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.200
I played it.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.440
I didn't like it.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.440
No?

17:27.440 --> 17:28.440
Really?

17:28.440 --> 17:29.440
It was just terrible.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.440
Like some of the different...

17:30.440 --> 17:33.280
They tried to do different things with a few different levels, like they have a mine cart

17:33.280 --> 17:39.280
level where you have to rotate the level around, and it just wasn't very fun.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.440
But I'm not really one to judge, because I never really cared for the Sonic series too

17:43.440 --> 17:45.800
much.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.200
But for me, it didn't change my mind about it.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.940
So that might be a good thing for people that like Sonic.

17:51.940 --> 17:55.460
It's more of the same, but I thought it was terrible.

17:55.460 --> 18:00.720
So that's my opinion, but this is coming from someone that doesn't really care for Sonic

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
the Hedgehog.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.720
Well, one thing.

18:02.720 --> 18:06.880
Now, I did watch someone play through the mine cart level, and it looks incredibly annoying.

18:06.880 --> 18:11.800
However, I do like the little air dashes in there, where you can target the enemies and

18:11.800 --> 18:12.960
dash at them.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.480
That was my favorite thing in Sonic Adventure.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.480
So I'm glad that's in there.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.160
I mean, that seems to me like it's enough of an innovation.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.120
I don't know.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.760
We'll see what it is when it comes out, for those of us who don't already have it.

18:24.760 --> 18:30.920
Yeah, I think the appeal of stuff like this is definitely that it's like the old Sonic

18:30.920 --> 18:31.920
games.

18:31.920 --> 18:37.280
It's still 2D, and the graphics are a bit shinier, but it's got that big nostalgia factor

18:37.280 --> 18:40.840
for people who are like, like I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog as a kid.

18:40.840 --> 18:46.780
So it's like, oh, wow, Sonic, I want to play this just to kind of relive those memories.

18:46.780 --> 18:47.880
That's a lot of it here with me.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.920
I mean, if they don't change what's not broken, right?

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
Exactly.

18:52.920 --> 18:53.920
Yeah.

18:53.920 --> 18:58.600
Well, in other news, oh, Bungie.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.520
They've done it again.

19:00.520 --> 19:08.720
They have banned 15,000 Halo Reach cheaters and are still looking for more to ban.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.720
Not technically cheating.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.560
They just found a glitch in the game and exploited it.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.400
Hey, my story, dude.

19:15.400 --> 19:20.360
Anyway, what they did, it was called network manipulation.

19:20.360 --> 19:27.320
They were going in, they found an exploit in the challenge, in one of the challenge

19:27.320 --> 19:36.000
levels where you could complete it 20 and more times and then keep disconnecting yourself.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.920
Or I like, as the Bungie rep said, intentional network manipulation to make it sound like

19:39.920 --> 19:43.840
it was something other than pulling out the cord.

19:43.840 --> 19:49.040
So they were able to find every one of these.

19:49.040 --> 19:53.280
So they've just gone and done a blanket ban.

19:53.280 --> 20:00.280
And what happened with the ban itself is that they've actually banned them for 24 hours

20:00.280 --> 20:03.920
and removed all of the credits that they earned.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.480
And so they won't be able to get any more.

20:06.480 --> 20:10.640
Tigerclaw in chat points out that it's still cheating if you exploit a glitch, which I

20:10.640 --> 20:12.120
think is true.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.120
I agree.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
I agree.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.360
That's just a poor excuse.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.360
I'm sorry.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.240
If there's a glitch in the game, then you need to patch it and be done with it.

20:21.240 --> 20:29.640
If you're using some sort of modified files or modified controllers or something like

20:29.640 --> 20:30.640
that, then fine.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.640
That's cheating.

20:31.640 --> 20:37.280
But if you're using the game and using glitches in the game for your benefit, then I don't

20:37.280 --> 20:38.280
see how that's cheating.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.360
Because you know why?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.320
It's available for everybody to do.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.000
It's not something that you have an advantage over somebody else.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.360
It's just they need to know how to do that.

20:46.360 --> 20:52.040
And if they can do that themselves, then it's just really skill.

20:52.040 --> 20:55.800
In other words, Halo makers, patch your damn game and fix it.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.800
Well, they are.

20:56.800 --> 21:02.080
So it wasn't really anything I don't think that affected a lot of people.

21:02.080 --> 21:07.400
It was just credits to buy crap for your characters.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.480
I don't even see what the big deal is.

21:11.480 --> 21:15.720
It's getting free credits to get free stuff in the end.

21:15.720 --> 21:21.240
But then again, I can see it both ways, especially trying to maintain some level of fairness

21:21.240 --> 21:24.360
in the game and definitely replayability.

21:24.360 --> 21:29.520
The more you play it, the more you have to earn the points the proper way.

21:29.520 --> 21:35.560
But one thing I would like to point out is that Halo Reach earned $200 million in its

21:35.560 --> 21:37.440
first 24 hours.

21:37.440 --> 21:41.840
So that's the biggest Xbox game ever.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.840
That's pretty amazing.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.840
They're getting their money out of it.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.640
Just a little bit.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.640
Halo!

21:47.640 --> 21:52.320
It prints money!

21:52.320 --> 21:53.560
So other fun stuff.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.400
Actually, I think you had one more thing.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.720
The cover there.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.960
Oh yes, Starcraft.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.680
Thank you.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.720
Because Bungie's not the only people buying in that.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.080
Oh, Blizzard's doing it too.

22:06.080 --> 22:11.240
Blizzard hit up 5,000 Starcraft 2 cheaters.

22:11.240 --> 22:19.800
They actually, for people who hacked and modded their game, they've been permanently banned.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.000
And I think they're still on the hunt for more people.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
But for right now?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Nope.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Sorry.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
You cheat, you lose.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Bye.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
K, thanks.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Bye.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Flush.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.920
They're getting serious on it.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.920
Yes.

22:35.920 --> 22:43.680
Literally, only a week away of its release, NBA Elite 11, the reboot, if you will, of

22:43.680 --> 22:48.720
the NBA Live franchise, has been delayed to 2011.

22:48.720 --> 22:54.440
And with it, of course, was the opportunity to get a free copy of NBA Jam, which was only

22:54.440 --> 22:59.840
going to be available originally through the purchase of NBA Elite 11, at least if you

22:59.840 --> 23:04.400
wanted it on PS3 or Xbox 360.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.760
Of course, they haven't announced when they're going to ship it yet, but apparently they're

23:08.760 --> 23:15.440
going to be shipping NBA Jam as a standalone product on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in time

23:15.440 --> 23:17.360
for the holidays.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.760
And they haven't said exactly when.

23:20.760 --> 23:27.160
I guess it's just a matter of time since the game was pretty much done anyways.

23:27.160 --> 23:32.800
And apparently they're not sure what the cost of it will be.

23:32.800 --> 23:37.480
Unfortunately, NBA Jam was supposed to be a free game, so if they go and charge $60

23:37.480 --> 23:41.400
for it, I think a lot of people are going to feel ripped off.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.600
But that'll be coming out sometime this year.

23:43.600 --> 23:49.360
Of course, NBA Jam is already available on the Wii, or at least it will be next week.

23:49.360 --> 23:54.960
And it's kind of funny, because that just makes NBA 2K11 the only choice for basketball,

23:54.960 --> 23:58.340
at least in October.

23:58.340 --> 24:01.400
You can go outside and play some real basketball.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.640
That would work too.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
I'm just saying.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.800
No, but then they'll fall and skin their knee!

24:07.800 --> 24:17.920
I'm actually kind of good at basketball, but I'm very klutzy, so I always am jamming a

24:17.920 --> 24:22.160
finger or getting hit in the face with a basketball or something.

24:22.160 --> 24:28.320
So yeah, the video game versions are very much safer than actual real life sports.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.360
You're not NBA Jamming your finger?

24:30.360 --> 24:33.920
Well, I mean, I dig NBA Jam.

24:33.920 --> 24:40.320
I think that's probably a game I'd be interested in, at least, versus NBA Elite.

24:40.320 --> 24:45.840
But you gotta ask yourself, you know, Elite 11 must have been really fucked up if they

24:45.840 --> 24:47.520
got to delay it to next year.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.000
I mean, was there some serious problems with that game?

24:51.000 --> 24:57.640
Obviously, no one seems to be really asking them, so why was the game delayed anyways?

24:57.640 --> 25:00.760
Licensed NBA star here wanted more money for said likeness.

25:00.760 --> 25:06.660
There is a rumor, though, that it was done, because there was somebody selling a disc

25:06.660 --> 25:08.680
on eBay for the PlayStation 3 version.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.000
I'm not sure if that was a demo disc or what.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.080
But at least there was some sort of disc pressed for NBA Elite 11.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.080
I don't know.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.720
It would be interesting to see.

25:21.720 --> 25:28.000
I mean, I don't really know if NBA Live 10 was just that terrible that they had to go

25:28.000 --> 25:33.120
back to the drawing board with Elite, which, by the way, I think Elite is a dumb name for

25:33.120 --> 25:34.120
their series anyways.

25:34.120 --> 25:38.520
You know, you have this long-running series that people are familiar with, and let's just

25:38.520 --> 25:42.160
get rid of that, because who needs name recognition anyways?

25:42.160 --> 25:43.160
It's EA.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.520
They're gonna buy anything we put out, right?

25:46.520 --> 25:51.320
So I think it's a little elitist that way, and at least they're taking the time to finish

25:51.320 --> 25:52.320
it.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.320
Yes.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.320
No pun there.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.280
For the record, mine was fully intended.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.280
I don't know.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.280
But yeah.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.280
Looking forward to NBA Jam.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.320
Hope there's lots of presidents in there.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.320
Hope Clinton's in there.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.320
Of course, Obama.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.320
That'd be funny.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.760
I think it'd be cool if you could play as Sarah What's-Her-Face.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.760
Sarah Palin?

26:10.760 --> 26:11.760
Yeah.

26:11.760 --> 26:18.320
I'd usually try to put her out of my head, but I'm just picturing now specialized quotes

26:18.320 --> 26:21.920
for different political figures that would be funny, like hers would be, hey, I can see

26:21.920 --> 26:24.360
Russia from up there.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.000
I can see Russia from the court.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.760
But anyways, moving on.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.320
Yes, please.

26:32.320 --> 26:39.600
Since Loki was talking about the 3DS release details, that wasn't all that was talked about

26:39.600 --> 26:44.480
during this whole Nintendo conference.

26:44.480 --> 26:49.840
Mistwalker's last story was actually given a release date, and it's going to be out on

26:49.840 --> 26:52.160
January 27th.

26:52.160 --> 26:58.720
But not only that, there's going to be a couple of Wii sequels that they announced at the

26:58.720 --> 27:00.000
Nintendo conference.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.460
And one is for the Game Boy Advance slash DS, and that's Rhythm Heaven.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.000
And I actually did not like that game.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.080
I played the first Rhythm Heaven, and yeah, I thought it kind of sucked.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.080
It did.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.080
Yeah.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.080
Yeah.

27:16.080 --> 27:20.120
So I don't know why that's exciting news, but it's there, you know.

27:20.120 --> 27:28.160
And the other one is a sequel to the Zero series, which is known here as Fatal Frame.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.280
Ooh, Fatal Frame is awesome.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.100
Yeah, that's kind of a cool game.

27:32.100 --> 27:35.600
That's more exciting than Rhythm Heaven, I think.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.440
The creep factor is definitely with that one.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.440
Yeah.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.440
Are you...

27:40.440 --> 27:44.280
Am I going to pick up Fatal Frame?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.280
No.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.280
I want to.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.280
I think I am.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.280
They already had a Fatal Frame game over here.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.280
I just...

27:49.280 --> 27:50.280
I don't really care.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
It was all right.

27:51.280 --> 27:56.400
I still need to buy Choanaki, which has nothing to do with Fatal Frame.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.640
I don't know if you need to buy that.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
Okay.

28:00.640 --> 28:04.920
It's probably not that good.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.800
Oh, come on.

28:06.800 --> 28:10.400
It's muscle-bound men flying around shooting things.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
My mistake.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.280
I guess that must be awesome, then.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.320
It is awesome.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.520
It's laughable and awesome.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.520
Indeed.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
Yeah.

28:19.520 --> 28:27.000
Well, now, moving on to another front, PC gaming.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.040
It's been speculated that the PC gaming market is on a serious decline, and yeah, we've seen

28:34.040 --> 28:35.040
a lot of it.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.640
Some of the major franchises just haven't been there or have been turning towards the

28:38.640 --> 28:45.520
consoles, but now they're saying that certain titles, certain key titles, will be saving

28:45.520 --> 28:50.400
PC gaming altogether, and that's Civilization V and StarCraft II, because, I mean, think

28:50.400 --> 28:51.600
about it.

28:51.600 --> 28:56.320
When those both came out, they were totally pulling in new players, and on top of that,

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
we've also gotten...

28:57.320 --> 29:02.220
This isn't just, you know, in the world of the MMO, because, I'm sorry, World of Warcraft

29:02.220 --> 29:09.840
is going to be keeping the PC gaming going, but these have just been really big powerhouses.

29:09.840 --> 29:15.000
They've definitely been pulling in the money and getting more people to, you know, upgrade

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
computer bits.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.440
Like, we upgraded our graphics card just so that Dan could play StarCraft II, and these

29:22.440 --> 29:24.240
are actually pulling in a lot more of the money.

29:24.240 --> 29:29.840
Now, other titles that are contributing to this, too, is definitely The Sims 3, because

29:29.840 --> 29:33.920
they keep bringing out more and more expansions to that, and I think Steam has the right idea

29:33.920 --> 29:40.540
with bringing out more and more PC games, but as far as those in particular, they are

29:40.540 --> 29:42.760
exclusively PC developed.

29:42.760 --> 29:47.480
They're ones that are definitely trying to keep that whole element of gaming alive, and

29:47.480 --> 29:52.120
do you think that they're going to be enough to keep it going?

29:52.120 --> 29:55.560
I don't even know if PC gaming is really dead.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.560
I mean, it's just...

29:56.560 --> 29:59.080
Well, it didn't say dead, just on the decline.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.040
I don't even know if that's true.

30:01.040 --> 30:09.400
I mean, if anything, I know digital distribution seems to work the best on PC.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
I don't think...

30:10.400 --> 30:15.520
I mean, it's definitely easier sometimes on consoles because you don't have to worry about

30:15.520 --> 30:19.960
having the specs to play a game.

30:19.960 --> 30:24.720
It's just, you know, it works or it doesn't.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.720
I don't know.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.160
I don't know if I agree with the statement that it's...

30:29.160 --> 30:34.600
I mean, I'm sure it helped because they're big selling games, but there will always be

30:34.600 --> 30:40.600
something else that comes out that will be a big selling game in the PC world.

30:40.600 --> 30:51.960
Well, now, Civ V got a 91 on Metacritic, which is pretty nice, and Starcraft 2, what is

30:51.960 --> 30:57.400
it, 3 million copies have been sold already?

30:57.400 --> 31:01.800
So that's pretty crazy, and it got a 93 on Metacritic.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.920
So I don't know.

31:04.920 --> 31:09.880
I think in some respects, if you look at it in a financial sense, as far as games that

31:09.880 --> 31:15.080
come out that just aren't selling very well, then I think that that's where the decline

31:15.080 --> 31:16.080
can be seen.

31:16.080 --> 31:20.000
Not necessarily the people that enjoy the gaming themselves, but just in the games that

31:20.000 --> 31:23.800
have come out and how well they sell, but these two have clearly turned that around

31:23.800 --> 31:24.800
if that was the case.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.800
Yeah.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.800
And then, of course, we've got our MMOs.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.800
Always going to be addicts.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.800
Right, Tara?

31:30.800 --> 31:31.800
Indeed.

31:31.800 --> 31:39.680
But for me, there are some MMOs that I can't play because I am on a Mac, so Star Trek Online

31:39.680 --> 31:46.600
is completely out for me, and my friend who also owns a Mac has Starcraft 2, and he has

31:46.600 --> 31:48.200
incredible problems with it.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.360
It's just not as stable.

31:51.360 --> 31:58.160
So for me, it's harder to play quote-unquote PC games because I don't own a PC, I own a

31:58.160 --> 31:59.160
Mac.

31:59.160 --> 32:04.200
Well now, Steam, though, does have a Mac client now with a good number of games.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.200
Yeah, that's true.

32:05.200 --> 32:10.360
That is true, and I actually have downloaded a couple of games through Steam.

32:10.360 --> 32:15.360
So actually, that has opened up the door to me to buy more games, but it's just a lot

32:15.360 --> 32:20.140
more difficult, especially if you don't, you know, if you want to go out and you just want

32:20.140 --> 32:24.960
to play a game right away and it's not available, it's like, well, I guess I'll just get the

32:24.960 --> 32:27.440
console version then.

32:27.440 --> 32:32.400
Well, Ranma's suggesting desktop parallels.

32:32.400 --> 32:38.880
I just, I don't like Windows, and I don't want to put Boot Camp or anything else on

32:38.880 --> 32:42.400
my Mac to run Windows in order to play games.

32:42.400 --> 32:49.640
Yeah, that's about what it's going to be like when I have my full Linux box, except Linux,

32:49.640 --> 32:53.280
one cool thing about Linux, though, is that it will run multiple environments fairly smoothly

32:53.280 --> 32:57.880
if you have the computer with the processing power for it.

32:57.880 --> 33:03.480
So I think that Linux users probably have the best of all those worlds.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.760
I would agree with that.

33:04.760 --> 33:10.520
You know, Linux is a good OS, and it's pretty stable, and it's better than Windows, and

33:10.520 --> 33:12.600
that's all I can say about that.

33:12.600 --> 33:20.000
And Linux Mint now is in its final production version, so that's pretty cool, but this isn't

33:20.000 --> 33:21.800
Linux chat.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.800
It's not?

33:22.800 --> 33:23.800
No.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.800
Oh, okay.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.480
It's Orishome's foodie-o, where I'm enjoying a delicious taco salad.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.680
Nom nom nom.

33:29.680 --> 33:35.240
So now that we've had our mention of food and Linux, how about some release dates?

33:35.240 --> 33:41.920
I feel sick since we were talking about food and Linux, mainly just about Linux.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.760
I got a sandwich and I thought it would be good, but it's not.

33:44.760 --> 33:50.320
Apparently this local grocery store over here, Rayleigh's, they have these mega subs now,

33:50.320 --> 33:52.480
and they have like input two different meats and stuff on it.

33:52.480 --> 33:55.960
Normally I just get like a turkey and cheese and stuff, but I figured, hey, two different

33:55.960 --> 33:59.000
meats, so I better pick two different meats, two different cheeses, I guess I better pick

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
two different cheeses.

34:00.000 --> 34:07.920
I have like a turkey, cheddar, provolone, and salami sandwich, and it's not as good

34:07.920 --> 34:08.920
as I would have hoped.

34:08.920 --> 34:12.520
The salami's too sweet, I guess.

34:12.520 --> 34:16.080
Anyways, so lots of stuff coming out this week because we are finally in the fourth

34:16.080 --> 34:21.800
quarter and they're kicking it off with lots of games.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.800
My mic is steady.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.240
Okay, you're cutting out just a little bit.

34:25.240 --> 34:26.240
I don't cut.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.600
Did you give me the crappy mic?

34:27.600 --> 34:30.240
I thought I didn't give you the crappy mic.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.240
Well thank you.

34:31.240 --> 34:37.800
Okay, anyways, so, lots of stuff coming out this week, of course, the delay of FIFA Soccer

34:37.800 --> 34:42.920
2011 on the Wii, it came out a week later than the rest, so poor, poor Wii people had

34:42.920 --> 34:44.640
to wait an additional week.

34:44.640 --> 34:51.120
Pokemon Ranger Guardian Signs on the Nintendo DS, yay, Pokemon!

34:51.120 --> 34:53.720
Pokemans, let us show you them.

34:53.720 --> 34:57.560
Hollywood Squares on the Nintendo Wii, yes.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.160
Because those games never get old.

35:00.160 --> 35:06.980
The Sports Collection from Ubisoft, can we get a more generic name for that, seriously?

35:06.980 --> 35:11.560
That's just some sports games, I guess, on the DS.

35:11.560 --> 35:16.640
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on the Wii and DS?

35:16.640 --> 35:19.240
I hope Regis is still in that.

35:19.240 --> 35:24.720
Enslaved Odyssey to the West coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 this week.

35:24.720 --> 35:28.920
It's supposed to be a pretty awesome action RPG.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.680
Littlest Pet Shop, got lots of games for that.

35:32.680 --> 35:38.000
Littlest Pet Shop, Biggest Star is Blue, Biggest Star is Pink, and Biggest Star is Purple,

35:38.000 --> 35:44.200
and yeah, got to purchase all three, I guess, because they're that awesome.

35:44.200 --> 35:48.760
Wait until you start buying Blue's Clues and all the kid titles for your little boy when

35:48.760 --> 35:50.400
he's older.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.800
Uh, no, for one, the other day I'll make those on DS.

35:54.800 --> 36:04.240
It's really just Dora or Go Diego Go, or Ni Ha, Kai Lan, um, no one will not be buying that

36:04.240 --> 36:05.240
crap.

36:05.240 --> 36:10.320
He will have more sophisticated tastes than that, I mean, come on.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.040
He's like, you know, I want the Dora the Explorer game.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.820
No, he wants a Mario Kart.

36:14.820 --> 36:15.820
That's it.

36:15.820 --> 36:18.000
Here you go, you shoot the hooker.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.280
Hey, I can mod a game of Grand Theft Auto that's not as violent.

36:24.280 --> 36:28.520
I have that ability.

36:28.520 --> 36:36.920
Ben 10 Ultimate Alien, that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP this week.

36:36.920 --> 36:43.280
Def Jam Rap Star, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, also with the version

36:43.280 --> 36:44.280
with the microphone.

36:44.280 --> 36:49.880
It is the, I guess, karaoke revolution of the rap world.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.960
And it must be hardcore because it's got Def Jam in front of it.

36:52.960 --> 37:01.480
NBA 2K11, now the only NBA game coming out this year, well, the only simulation NBA game

37:01.480 --> 37:02.980
coming out this year.

37:02.980 --> 37:07.960
That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii.

37:07.960 --> 37:14.440
Ah, yes, more kids games, as you were mentioning before, stuff I could purchase for my son

37:14.440 --> 37:15.440
later on.

37:15.440 --> 37:20.040
Freddy Fish ABC Under the Sea, that's definitely for little kids.

37:20.040 --> 37:27.680
Pets, Fantasies, Sunshine Magic, and Moonlight Magic, those are on DS as well.

37:27.680 --> 37:32.320
Castlevania Lords of Shadow, the Castlevania game that's not really Castlevania, but has

37:32.320 --> 37:37.440
Castlevania entitled Just to Sell More Copies, and that is coming out on PlayStation 3 and

37:37.440 --> 37:41.200
Xbox 360 this week as well.

37:41.200 --> 37:49.840
Ah, the epic, award-winning I Love Puppies for Nintendo DS, and it's neither of those

37:49.840 --> 37:50.840
two.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.840
It's just another puppy game where you raise puppies and do stuff.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.840
But don't you love puppies, Logie?

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
Puppies are great!

37:55.840 --> 37:59.920
Puppies are fine, but I'm not gonna buy another game with puppies in it.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.120
I learned the first time, thank you Nintendo.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.080
Vampire Moon, the Mystery of the Hidden Sun.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.520
It's a vampire adventure game, yay!

38:07.520 --> 38:12.160
It was probably one of those hidden picture games, and I guess that's fine.

38:12.160 --> 38:19.080
Rapala Pro Bass Fishing 2010, the bundles version of that, with your wireless fishing

38:19.080 --> 38:26.680
rod, so you can, I don't know, live out your white trash fantasies, I don't know.

38:26.680 --> 38:31.920
Way of the, that's a re-release, if I ever saw one, Way of the Samurai 3, it's already

38:31.920 --> 38:32.920
been out.

38:32.920 --> 38:36.080
I'm not gonna even mention that again.

38:36.080 --> 38:41.560
Um, Final Fantasy, the Four Heroes of Light on Nintendo DS, that's actually a pretty good

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
release.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
Yay!

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
Yay!

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
Woo!

38:45.560 --> 38:49.120
I agree with Ranma, he says fuck all these puppy games, I want a kitty game, dammit.

38:49.120 --> 38:53.760
They, okay, listen, they are gonna have kitty games coming out, in fact, I know there's

38:53.760 --> 38:59.040
one coming out, but you're gonna have to live with the puppy game for right now.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.800
How about a monkey game?

39:00.800 --> 39:03.200
They already had a monkey game, okay.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.200
There's been a ferret game too.

39:04.200 --> 39:08.480
There's been a pets monkeys game, in fact there was two pets monkeys games, and they

39:08.480 --> 39:09.980
were terrible.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.520
You dressed up monkeys in like little outfits and stuff.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
That's fantastic.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.800
That sounds like the most amazing thing ever.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.340
I only remember what, there was some TV show where there's these people that couldn't have

39:20.340 --> 39:24.360
children or something, they're really old people, and they ended up dressing up monkeys

39:24.360 --> 39:28.240
like children, and would take them out in like baby carriages and stuff like that.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.880
It's very, very disturbing, and you can still get that game, so that, you know.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.480
Alright, Tiara, we need to go get pets monkeys.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.360
Yes, I agree with that statement.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.880
Dress up our monkeys.

39:37.880 --> 39:38.880
Yes.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.520
John Daly's Pro Stroke Golf on Playstation 3, it is-

39:41.520 --> 39:42.520
Pro Stroke.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.920
Pro Stroke, yes.

39:44.920 --> 39:48.240
He's not just an amateur stroke, he can stroke it like a pro.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.240
Oh my.

39:49.240 --> 39:54.440
That is coming out on Playstation 3, it does support the Playstation move for one-to-one

39:54.440 --> 39:55.880
stroking.

39:55.880 --> 40:02.840
And then this was, I think, a leftover from last week because, oops, prank party, still

40:02.840 --> 40:06.400
hasn't come out yet, thank you Hudson for delaying that another week, so I have to mention

40:06.400 --> 40:09.040
it for you, free advertising there.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.080
More Bomberman, Hudson, do you hear me?

40:11.080 --> 40:12.080
More Bomberman.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.840
There's a new Bomberman game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade at some point.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
Bomberman.

40:16.840 --> 40:17.840
I've seen it.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.240
My own eyes.

40:21.240 --> 40:27.280
Coco Interactive, it's another casual game, Jewel Master Cradle of Athena.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.960
Who gives a crap what it's about, it's just a jewel game that you match three.

40:31.960 --> 40:37.920
NBA Jam coming out on the Wii, that's right, you get it before the Playstation 3 and Xbox

40:37.920 --> 40:42.560
360 versions because it was actually supposed to come out standalone on the Wii.

40:42.560 --> 40:47.360
None of this fancy stuff because your game sucks, so you had to delay it and that kind

40:47.360 --> 40:49.360
of fun stuff.

40:49.360 --> 40:59.480
Um, and that would be it for this week, I know, disappointing, not a lot of pets games.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.880
Yeah, needs more monkeys.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.120
Definitely more monkeys.

41:04.120 --> 41:11.040
Sadly there are no monkeys being released in Japan this week either, but there is enslaved

41:11.040 --> 41:19.320
Odyssey to the West on both the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, as well as F1 2010 on both

41:19.320 --> 41:26.400
of those consoles, and Red Dead Redemption and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 are both out on the

41:26.400 --> 41:30.460
360 and the PSP as well this week.

41:30.460 --> 41:39.520
And on the PS3, but not on the Xbox 360, we have Gekijoban Makros F Itsuarino Utahime

41:39.520 --> 41:48.040
Hybrid Pack, yay that's a mouthful, I heard Makros, yes, Makros F to be precise, that's

41:48.040 --> 41:56.000
from the new anime Frontier, right, yeah, and Ken Tomahou Togakugen Mono 3 is also coming

41:56.000 --> 42:02.800
out for the Playstation 3, and coming out on the Sony PSP this week we've got Bokuakoku

42:02.800 --> 42:11.320
Kenseikan Airport Hero Hameda, so that should be something with an airport in it I assume,

42:11.320 --> 42:21.360
Kana Imoto is coming out as well as the limited edition version, and Ken Tomahou Togakugen

42:21.360 --> 42:25.120
Mono 3 is also coming out on the PSP.

42:25.120 --> 42:33.920
And lastly for Japanese releases on the Nintendo DS, we've got Kingdom Hearts Recoded, yeah

42:33.920 --> 42:43.160
that's fun, I love Kingdom Hearts, yay, we also have 10 Kaichi Sengoku Lovers, and Maru

42:43.160 --> 42:54.440
Gogaku Shikaku Dashu Hanbashi Kente Shiken 2Q 3Q, that's too many QQ's, that's two or

42:54.440 --> 43:01.760
three too many Q's, two Q's is sad, three Q's is grateful, sound cute, anyway, that

43:01.760 --> 43:11.000
was awful, how about we go jump overboard and swim our way over to the UK, actually

43:11.000 --> 43:15.600
I would just rather just be teleported there and stay, that would be great, on the 5th

43:15.600 --> 43:21.760
we have Left 4 Dead The Sacrifice for PC and Xbox 360, and on the 5th we also have Fantasy

43:21.760 --> 43:27.640
Star Portable 2, on the 8th is a whole crap ton of stuff, Castlevania Lords of Shadow,

43:27.640 --> 43:33.480
Enslaved Odyssey to the West, Final Fantasy, The Four Heroes of Light, Front Mission Evolved,

43:33.480 --> 43:42.200
John Daly's Pro Stroke Off, cause he likes to stroke it, like a pro in England, oh dear,

43:42.200 --> 43:52.800
PES 2011, We Party, and WRC on a bunch of systems, and that would be it for the UK.

43:52.800 --> 43:59.560
Alrighty, well one game that's not coming out this week, or even when it was intentionally

43:59.560 --> 44:07.640
gonna come out back in April of 2011, Gears of War 3 has been delayed to the 4th quarter,

44:07.640 --> 44:12.320
no reason why, I'm sure it's just to add extra polish, or because Microsoft realized hey,

44:12.320 --> 44:17.820
we don't have a good 4th quarter game, so it will not be coming out when it's intended,

44:17.820 --> 44:22.040
but you know what, there's plenty of games coming out in April, and hell, I wouldn't

44:22.040 --> 44:33.720
want to take any more time away from Marvel vs. Capcom 3, so I'm fine with that delay.

44:33.720 --> 44:40.160
I definitely, I think I could just totally ignore any Gears of War for Marvel vs. Capcom

44:40.160 --> 44:45.680
3, because that game is full of the awesome and tons of characters I want to play.

44:45.680 --> 44:52.800
Yeah, MVC 3, yes, Gears of War 3, probably not, because I haven't played Gears of War

44:52.800 --> 44:56.920
1 or 2, just saying.

44:56.920 --> 45:03.200
I don't know, I think I'm most excited for playing as X-23 in Deadpool.

45:03.200 --> 45:08.280
I don't know about Deadpool, but yeah, Deadpool in video games is kind of cool because he's

45:08.280 --> 45:12.760
aware that he's a video game character, and he has all the funny lines, but there's too

45:12.760 --> 45:13.760
much Deadpool.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.480
Deadpool is self-aware now.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.480
Yes.

45:16.480 --> 45:22.480
Well really, don't get us started on Deadpool, because we always have the weekly Deadpool

45:22.480 --> 45:28.440
rant on comic insanity, plug plug plug.

45:28.440 --> 45:35.720
But a game that is coming out that is not being delayed, well, it's not being delayed

45:35.720 --> 45:41.600
because it came out in 2003, and I remember playing this game on the PS2, is Beyond Good

45:41.600 --> 45:42.600
and Evil.

45:42.600 --> 45:43.600
Do you guys remember that game?

45:43.600 --> 45:44.600
Yes.

45:44.600 --> 45:45.600
Yeah.

45:45.600 --> 45:48.740
That was a good game, and it's actually getting an HD re-release.

45:48.740 --> 45:54.560
So Ubisoft is going to be re-releasing the game in high definition, and they haven't

45:54.560 --> 45:58.120
said when, but sometime in 2011.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.440
That sounds like it will be a treat.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.440
Yes indeed.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.000
I'm very excited about that.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.680
I really loved that game.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.160
It was a good game.

46:07.160 --> 46:16.560
Well now it's time for the classic game of the week, and because I do this, it's kind

46:16.560 --> 46:21.560
of weird for me to have to manipulate the music and everything at the same time, so

46:21.560 --> 46:26.840
I'm actually just going to stop that, because I don't have Rob's mad skills to do them all

46:26.840 --> 46:28.440
at the same time.

46:28.440 --> 46:32.680
And I will instead start off with a little bit of music, and I'd like to see how many

46:32.680 --> 46:35.040
people can guess what it is.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
Just by the opening.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.040
Very beginning.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.040
Presented by Sega.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.040
That should be clue enough.

46:41.040 --> 46:44.080
Hey, we are the Sonic Team.

46:44.080 --> 46:49.080
Yes, the game of the week is Samba de...

46:49.080 --> 46:51.080
Samba de amigo!

46:51.080 --> 46:53.080
Samba de nidé!

46:53.080 --> 46:54.080
Woohoo!

46:54.080 --> 46:55.080
Party!

46:55.080 --> 46:57.560
I have a special love of Samba de amigo.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.560
Uno, due, dre, cuatro.

46:59.560 --> 47:03.160
God, the music is just so perky.

47:03.160 --> 47:08.960
I feel like shaking my butt, or some maracas, or maybe the microphone like a maraca.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.280
Or all three of those.

47:10.280 --> 47:15.680
I will do them all at the same time, which makes it really bad for radio.

47:15.680 --> 47:22.040
At any rate, as we've been talking about maracas, yes you use maracas as your controllers, and

47:22.040 --> 47:25.560
they have these little sensors on the bottom.

47:25.560 --> 47:32.000
And what you do is, you have to hit these little, there's two in the middle that are

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
on the top, and two in the middle that are on the bottom, and then two out to the side.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.480
Well, one on each side.

47:36.480 --> 47:42.200
And you have to hit the right little sphere with your maraca at the same time, and it

47:42.200 --> 47:44.520
uses the motion sensor to make sure you're in the right place.

47:44.520 --> 47:49.360
You have to actually adjust it by your height so that you can make sure that you're going

47:49.360 --> 47:51.880
to hit the sensor at the right place.

47:51.880 --> 48:00.720
And this game was played at many a New Year's party at my house, I can say.

48:00.720 --> 48:08.360
The game uses lots of different Latin-styled music, and you are, on screen you are represented

48:08.360 --> 48:10.640
by a monkey named Amigo.

48:10.640 --> 48:13.000
We're back to monkeys, Takara.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.600
Yay, monkey!

48:15.600 --> 48:19.960
And he will dance, and the better you do, he'll do the ice-crunchy Cartman face and

48:19.960 --> 48:24.160
start dancing even more, and then the sky will turn all rainbows, and so you either

48:24.160 --> 48:36.360
shake high, or you shake middle, or you shake low, and when you hit the blue areas, you're

48:36.360 --> 48:40.380
just going to hit it once and shake, but you have red ones that tell you just to shake

48:40.380 --> 48:43.320
it over and over and over and over and over again.

48:43.320 --> 48:49.360
And then the stickly man comes up on the screen, which we all know stickly man from his next

48:49.360 --> 48:56.920
job working for Homestar Runner, but he poses, and you have to match that pose by holding

48:56.920 --> 49:01.320
each maraca at the right position, as indicated on the screen.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.360
So you can pick three songs and play through each of them.

49:04.360 --> 49:07.440
You can play them easier or harder.

49:07.440 --> 49:13.240
You also have little mini-games, one called Guacamole, which is actually pronounced Guacamole,

49:13.240 --> 49:18.340
like Whack-a-mole, and Strike a Pose, where you have to do different series of poses,

49:18.340 --> 49:23.800
and one, two, samba, where you have to hit different spots in sequence.

49:23.800 --> 49:29.760
In the Japanese version, it's called ichinii samba, which is a funny pun in Japanese, because

49:29.760 --> 49:33.040
it's one, two, three, but samba, yeah, anyway.

49:33.040 --> 49:37.440
There's party mode and battle, where you can play versus couples game.

49:37.440 --> 49:41.440
There's a couples game version, which in Japan is called Love Love, where you play through

49:41.440 --> 49:44.520
the song to see how compatible you are.

49:44.520 --> 49:53.240
And then in later versions, in version 2000, there's different things to play in there,

49:53.240 --> 49:59.720
like hustle mode, where you have to follow the dots and shake the maracas the right way,

49:59.720 --> 50:05.440
but you have to do things in these really weird poses, and you're actually moving the

50:05.440 --> 50:08.920
full 360 rotation around, so it's kind of interesting.

50:08.920 --> 50:14.440
There's also different versions out that have extra songs in there.

50:14.440 --> 50:21.520
In version 2000, there's another monkey out called Amiga, who plays a tambourine, and

50:21.520 --> 50:22.980
she's very fun.

50:22.980 --> 50:35.200
In the other versions that came out, there actually are other songs that were in different

50:35.200 --> 50:42.480
Sega games, like for downloadables, you had the theme from After Burners, you had Burning

50:42.480 --> 50:44.680
Hearts from Burning Rangers, which I love.

50:44.680 --> 50:49.560
You also have the Rent-A-Hero theme, which is incredibly funny, stuff from Nights, stuff

50:49.560 --> 50:56.800
from Sonic Adventure, Jet Set Radio, Daytona USA, Outrun, Fantasy Zone, the Oppa Oppa theme

50:56.800 --> 51:02.640
is in there, Sonic CD, the Japanese opening song is in there, Super Sonic Racing from

51:02.640 --> 51:08.140
Sonic R, and just a bunch of cool stuff, but as far as the songs in the game, definitely

51:08.140 --> 51:14.000
some people might recognize Mambo No. 5 and Mexican Flyer, well anyone who played Space

51:14.000 --> 51:21.720
Channel 5 and watched Swing Girls should know that song anyway, Oya Como Va by Santana,

51:21.720 --> 51:27.840
Papa Loves Mambo is in there, also SOS The Tiger Took My Family by Dr. Bombay is in there,

51:27.840 --> 51:31.160
which has nothing to do with Latin music.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.120
And yet is still awesome.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.280
Yes.

51:34.280 --> 51:41.720
And one of my favorite things to play in there was actually the Cup of Life is in there,

51:41.720 --> 51:46.920
I thought it was funny, and the Stupid Catch-Up Song is in there, which I always avoided,

51:46.920 --> 51:48.880
and Highway to Hell is in there.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.760
In the Wii version anyway.

51:50.760 --> 51:51.760
So yeah.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.840
That has a lot to do with Latin music.

51:53.840 --> 52:01.800
I'm going to play the combination of Highway to Hell and Tub Thumping, which is also in

52:01.800 --> 52:04.400
all of the versions.

52:04.400 --> 52:09.960
It's really fun, actually the Wii version did come out, but it didn't get very, very

52:09.960 --> 52:12.780
good ratings.

52:12.780 --> 52:18.460
It has some extra stuff in there, it has Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet, and Mambo Mambo,

52:18.460 --> 52:26.920
and I Want Candy, and it's got other characters in there, such as Sonic and Ooh La La.

52:26.920 --> 52:33.320
And you can, it will use your little me's, and put some right by your score.

52:33.320 --> 52:38.200
And it changes the different expressions that are used based on your performance in the

52:38.200 --> 52:40.000
game.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.440
There was a successor out that not many people know about, I've actually played it, that's

52:46.440 --> 52:54.000
called Shakuto Tambourine, which is played just like Samba de Amigo, except you use a

52:54.000 --> 52:57.320
tambourine controller and it's all J-Pop music.

52:57.320 --> 53:03.640
And there was a version of Samba de Amigo, kinda, that was the itoy version for Sega

53:03.640 --> 53:10.060
Superstars, where it used the itoy to hold where your hands were, instead of the sensors

53:10.060 --> 53:11.600
like the maracas used.

53:11.600 --> 53:17.240
And by the way, Shakuto Tambourine is actually really fun and very hard, just saying.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.240
Very hard.

53:18.240 --> 53:21.720
Because you've only got one tambourine, and you have to do these little swiping moves

53:21.720 --> 53:25.360
over your head and shake the tambourine at the same time, and it's kind of a pain in

53:25.360 --> 53:26.360
the butt.

53:26.360 --> 53:31.520
Anyway, you've got characters, you have Amigo, who we've mentioned is a monkey, and Amigo,

53:31.520 --> 53:34.460
who is also a monkey, woohoo!

53:34.460 --> 53:39.960
And we have Linda, who is the Samba school dancer that wears the butterfly costume.

53:39.960 --> 53:43.080
And Bingo and Bongo, they're bears that play the bongos.

53:43.080 --> 53:46.440
Rio is a cat person who's like a cat and a jaguar.

53:46.440 --> 53:49.480
He carries a rose and a horn, ooh.

53:49.480 --> 53:54.720
There's Chumba and Wamba, who play the mandolin and the conga drums, and they're named after

53:54.720 --> 53:56.720
Chumbawamba.

53:56.720 --> 54:01.800
And Mr. Pose, who is also known as Stickley Man.

54:01.800 --> 54:08.080
And that is the game, that is Samba de Amigo, which I personally think the Dreamcast ones

54:08.080 --> 54:12.240
are the best, but that would be me.

54:12.240 --> 54:16.880
So anybody else enjoy Samba de Amigo?

54:16.880 --> 54:22.200
Samba de Amigo is awesome, but like all the animals, the way that you describe the characters

54:22.200 --> 54:29.560
just now, it makes me think of like old Disney cartoons like DuckTales and Tailspin, where

54:29.560 --> 54:34.560
it's like a town full of weird animals doing stuff that people usually do.

54:34.560 --> 54:41.320
It sounds like Samba de Amigo belongs in like, you know, the Disney kind of world.

54:41.320 --> 54:47.040
Yeah, I guess so.

54:47.040 --> 54:54.320
Maybe they've got their own like Amigoville, where they all hang out and drink Nescafe.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.480
I used to play Samba de Amigo a lot, like a million years ago.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.800
It was a long time ago.

54:59.800 --> 55:00.800
It was a good game though.

55:00.800 --> 55:01.800
It was fun.

55:01.800 --> 55:02.800
Oh, it's fantastic.

55:02.800 --> 55:06.640
Some of my old New Year's parties that we used to have over here were always, I mean

55:06.640 --> 55:11.240
rock bands pretty much replaced just about everything music related, but would always

55:11.240 --> 55:17.080
break out DDR and Samba de Amigo and pretty soon just be drunk in Samba de Amigo, surrounded

55:17.080 --> 55:23.520
by lots of beer and people would fall over and I would tell them not to break my maracas.

55:23.520 --> 55:28.160
I still have my maracas and I still, I should dust them off and play them soon.

55:28.160 --> 55:30.040
You should.

55:30.040 --> 55:35.560
Well, we are now though, sadly at the end of part A, but this means we get to go into

55:35.560 --> 55:39.000
part B. Yay.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.600
So everyone stay tuned.

55:41.600 --> 55:47.240
We're going to go to a little break and we will hear you when we, we will hear you.

55:47.240 --> 55:49.280
We will talk to you when we get back.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.960
You will hear us when we get back.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.960
I can't hear them.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.960
Ah, no.

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
Okay.

55:55.960 --> 56:08.880
Welcome back to part B of episode four, three hundred and eight, the three eighty four.

56:08.880 --> 56:09.880
Three eighty four.

56:09.880 --> 56:10.880
Yes.

56:10.880 --> 56:11.880
Episode yes.

56:11.880 --> 56:12.880
Of Orange Lounge Radio.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.480
I am the Dark Sakura.

56:14.480 --> 56:21.200
This is Loki and joining us is Mar and Marvel, also known as or known in real life as Tiara.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.200
Woo hoo.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.720
I just told them your secret identity.

56:24.720 --> 56:25.720
Oh no.

56:25.720 --> 56:29.920
So it's like you unmasked me in front of millions and millions of people.

56:29.920 --> 56:35.160
Now I'm going to have to make a deal with the devil and have my entire history changed

56:35.160 --> 56:37.320
so that nobody knows who I am.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.600
Except really the Illuminati is behind it.

56:39.600 --> 56:40.600
Yep.

56:40.600 --> 56:41.600
Yeah.

56:41.600 --> 56:50.840
So welcome back, but that's another reference to perhaps a different podcast that Tiara

56:50.840 --> 56:51.840
and I do.

56:51.840 --> 56:52.840
Hmm.

56:52.840 --> 56:53.840
Perhaps.

56:53.840 --> 56:57.880
A different friend of ours who is also an Orange Lounge listener.

56:57.880 --> 57:00.200
So welcome back to the show.

57:00.200 --> 57:06.560
As I said, we have got some rapid fire news coming up and tweeter topics because they're

57:06.560 --> 57:08.960
tweety and good.

57:08.960 --> 57:14.640
And if you're all good, then Tiara might do it in a porn voice.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.640
Perhaps.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
Perhaps.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
Perhaps.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.640
Mayhaps?

57:18.640 --> 57:19.640
Mayhaps.

57:19.640 --> 57:20.640
Mayhaps.

57:20.640 --> 57:22.640
We may have porn voice tonight.

57:22.640 --> 57:23.640
Hahaha.

57:23.640 --> 57:24.640
Okay.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.640
So why don't you get us started, Loki?

57:25.640 --> 57:30.960
Finally, we've been begging and pleading for Capcom to listen, and they have Mega Man Legends

57:30.960 --> 57:33.200
3 has been announced.

57:33.200 --> 57:40.100
Coming to the 3DS, of course, right now it's just Project, or Mega Man Legends 3 Project.

57:40.100 --> 57:45.760
It's a work in progress, I guess, and we'll be coming out at some point, I'm guessing

57:45.760 --> 57:46.760
probably next year.

57:46.760 --> 57:49.120
So that'll be kind of cool.

57:49.120 --> 57:54.200
And of course, this week, like every other week, Rock Band Download content.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.200
Got lots of it.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.760
This week we've got REM.

57:57.760 --> 58:01.280
They have a pack there, including Driver 8.

58:01.280 --> 58:04.720
It's the end of the world as we know it.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.760
Living Well is the best revenge.

58:06.760 --> 58:14.200
Radio Free Europe, Stand, Superman These Days, and What's the Frequency, Kenneth.

58:14.200 --> 58:18.780
Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in fake points.

58:18.780 --> 58:23.040
Or you can get the pack for $13.49 or 1080 Microsoft Points.

58:23.040 --> 58:29.220
Sorry, it's not available for a pack on the WiiWare store.

58:29.220 --> 58:33.120
Also the T-Rex pack, featuring 3 songs from them.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.960
Children of the Revolution, Cosmic Dancer, and Jeepster.

58:36.960 --> 58:41.320
Also those available for $2 each or $5.49 for the whole pack.

58:41.320 --> 58:44.680
So that'll be coming this week.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.960
And unfortunately no standalone songs.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.320
I guess it's just those two packs.

58:49.320 --> 58:53.880
You can purchase a song standalone in there, but nothing additional.

58:53.880 --> 59:01.840
And then finally, there's been some new information coming out about my game of the year next

59:01.840 --> 59:02.840
year.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.320
Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

59:05.320 --> 59:06.320
Some gameplay video.

59:06.320 --> 59:08.600
Looked absolutely awesome.

59:08.600 --> 59:15.280
Of course, they had some details regarding the gameplay in case anyone had concerns.

59:15.280 --> 59:18.640
First off, there's actually some new armors that you can use in the game.

59:18.640 --> 59:22.400
They have 4 different ones that you can kind of swap around through.

59:22.400 --> 59:26.440
You will still be limited to 2 weapons per mission, which kind of sucks because I really

59:26.440 --> 59:27.440
wish it was 3.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.440
But whatever.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.440
I'll deal.

59:29.440 --> 59:37.280
And 150 weapons, also I believe you can earn different points to increase abilities on

59:37.280 --> 59:39.720
your player as well as the weapons that you have.

59:39.720 --> 59:44.160
There will also be an equivalent to the genocide gun in the game, which for those who haven't

59:44.160 --> 59:48.640
played Earth Defense Force 2017, the genocide gun is a gun that fires a really big laser

59:48.640 --> 59:51.520
blast that blows up a lot of stuff.

59:51.520 --> 59:57.160
The title itself will also run very smoothly as opposed to the last game that came out,

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.920
where you can actually have up to 80 enemies on the screen and the game will actually keep

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.400
running smoothly at 30 frames per second.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:09.600
The game will also feature some increased difficulties as well, the legendary infernal

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.600
mode.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.000
It's going to take about 8 hours to complete the game on normal mode, but normal is for

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.760
wimps, so no one should actually play it on normal.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.400
And they're also going to have a 6 player horde mode, which apparently you will be pitted

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.960
against endless waves of enemies that will attack you relentlessly.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.840
Also a remix mode where random enemies will spawn instead of the normal enemies that appear

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.520
during the campaign.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.440
And if you're very interested in checking it out, there's some gameplay video on Destructoid

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.720
and oh my god it looks awesome.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:46.520
I was kind of worried though with the developer being the one that did the Matt Hazard game

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.920
and that wasn't that great, but it looks cool and the dialogue is extremely cheesy, so it

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.320
should be cool.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:59.920
One other thing, the game will actually have 3 player co-op drop in drop out.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.380
They're also going to have 2 AI controlled bots that will fight alongside of you in case

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.560
you don't have actual friends to play with.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.680
And apparently they are pretty good and they'll actually help you out through the game, otherwise

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.920
you can get people to help you out.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.400
And definitely looking forward to this, going to probably pick up about 3 copies of it,

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:26.840
so make sure I have one for each person to play at my work, so yeah, check it out.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.440
And we got any more news, Tiara?

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.240
Yes we do.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:38.440
Those of you who have pre-ordered your keyboard bundle for Rock Band 3 on the PS3 may have

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:45.680
noticed that it has disappeared from US retail sites and that's because there is a contract

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.600
problem where Harmonix cannot sell the PS3 keyboard bundle.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.760
So you will have to buy your keyboard for $10 extra, but you can still buy the bundle

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:04.080
on the Xbox 360 and Wii, so that's good, yay, because I have the Xbox 360.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:12.240
And also, Konami is releasing an awesome, awesome, awesome new 3D racing arcade game

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.220
called Road Fighters, and it's got like a cabinet with a steering wheel, and it has

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:22.560
drop down 3D glasses, so that's kind of awesome.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.640
And you can switch between 2D and 3D by pushing a button, and I don't know, it seems cool,

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.220
I love arcade games like this, I suck at racing games, but it just looks cool, and 3D is the

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:40.840
whole new fad of TV, movies, and gaming, so it should be interesting, and it does look

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.240
really cool.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:49.960
The glasses look ridiculous, I have to say, but it should be fun, and 3D really I think

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:55.240
is an excellent element for a racing game, since you are right in there with all the

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.080
cars and all the excitement.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.120
The glasses look 80s-tastic.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.600
They do, they really do, I think that's part of the reason it's so awesome.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.960
That's great.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.560
And lastly, with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 coming out, and Street Fighter 4 released lately,

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.120
and things like that, what about Darkstalkers?

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.880
I would like to see another game having something to do with Darkstalkers, wouldn't you?

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880
Absolutely.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:29.040
Well, Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono told Eurogamer that making another game in the series would

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.400
be his ultimate dream, and it can only happen if fans demand it.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:42.880
And he said that it's all up to the readers to get Inafune-san interested in doing the

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:49.040
game, and according to Ono, it would take 1 million requests before Inafune says yes.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.160
So unfortunately there haven't been that many requests for the game.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:00.860
There have been about 5,000, so only 995,000 more requests for a Darkstalkers game before

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.360
they will consider making one.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360
Get on it, peeps.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.920
I'm not gonna put my name in there.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:12.800
It's dumb, I mean come on, they're doing this crap that they did with, like, what, uh, paranormal

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800
activity.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.080
They're doing the same shit with the second movie too, by the way, where, demand it in

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.080
your city.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.080
No, how about I don't?

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080
Because the first movie was terrible.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080
Yeah, as I said-

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080
I demand that you don't put it in my city.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.040
More like Paris Normal activity, I thought it was the worst movie ever, but I digress.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.640
This is Darkstalkers, and Darkstalkers is awesome.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.080
Yeah, but I think that they should know that the interest is out there, and if they made

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.880
the game, that people would buy it, and you know, for them to be like, oh no, you have

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.480
to ask us for it.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.960
Well just make the freaking game, it's not like you're gonna be losing money on it.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.520
Well ask for it with our dollars.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.520
Yes.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.520
Or our yen.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520
Or whatever.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.280
If you say it bluntly, it's like saying, okay, listen, you gotta suck my cock, but you're

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.600
gonna have to beg for it first, I mean, that's, that's the way they're putting it, I mean,

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.400
it's just, it's insulting.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:07.040
I mean, if you wanna put out a game, put out a good fighting game, because people are gonna

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.500
buy any fighting game that you put out.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.000
Don't make people beg for it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.900
We own the recipe for these fantastic lollipops, but a million of you must say that you want

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.440
our lollipops.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.360
And by lollipops, we mean cock, so.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:26.760
I was trying to do something that every, who does not like a good lollipop, I mean, please.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.680
Well, how about the other things that are definitely gonna be coming out.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.960
Square Enix is actually making adjustments to bring out Parasite Eve on PSN, and I don't

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.320
know about you guys, but Parasite Eve was pretty fun, although I do have to say there

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.600
were other games that I thought were more fun, but Parasite Eve was pretty cool.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.880
Not bad for a game based off of a book.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.720
So they're basically just gonna be bringing it out, they just have to tweak it, so that

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720
it'll be playable.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.440
And it's not just Parasite Eve, it's Parasite Eve 2 on the PSN.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.720
Did you ever see the live action movie?

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.440
I have it somewhere, I haven't watched it.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.640
I've been trying to look for the translated version of the book.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.400
I think I have it on VCD somewhere.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.480
I've got a VCD of it, yeah, that's, my copy's on a VCD as well.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.400
I just sorta, oh, that's cool, and then, oh, look what else we've got, Final Fuck X.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.580
Cause I think I got them both at the same time.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.040
That was also based off a book.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040
Not really.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040
Okay.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.360
And, moving forward, how about Scott Pilgrim?

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:35.000
The new download content is going to have, for Scott Pilgr- I said Spock Pilgrim.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Spock Pilgrim.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.400
I would buy Spock Pilgrim, cause it is Spocktober, you know.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.400
Yes it is.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.980
For Scott Pilgrim vs. the World the Game, there is going to be new download content

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.460
to go along with the film's release on DVD and Blu-ray.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.720
It will have a new playable character, Knives Chow, along with two other modes.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.520
That's an arena battle with weapons, kind of a light version of Super Smash Brothers

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520
it's described as, and dodgeball.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:09.880
And it will be $1.99 on Playstation Network or 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.980
And they also are going to fix some of the difficulty balancing to make it, the average

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:23.360
Joe level, more forgiving, and get rid of some bugs, and do drop in, drop out co-op.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.640
It's only though for offline play only.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:35.160
And they're not going to incorporate the online MMO into it, so none of that yet.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:42.020
And then, speaking of Spock, Star Trek Infinite Space is to be coming out.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:51.160
It's a free-to-play browser version of the game, so Mac people can play it.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.400
And it will be out in the summer of 2011.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:08:00.320
It's going to be published by Gameforge and developed by Keen, who also did What's Cooking

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.960
with Jamie Oliver.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.760
And now this is the part that makes me happy.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.280
It's set during Deep Space Nine.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280
That's cool.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.880
I thought you were going to say Jamie Oliver is in the game, so that's exciting.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880
No.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.680
That's not special.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.560
The only cooking I want is the Klingon chef who plays the violin.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.880
Yes.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.520
And sings opera.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.440
Klingon opera is the best.

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.520
Yes it is.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.920
And serves half-dead gah.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:35.880
And of course, you should hopefully be able to read Shakespeare and its original Klingon

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880
in this game.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.200
Because it sounds the best in its original Klingon.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.200
Yes.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:48.840
But the director, Anthony Christolakis, I guess, Greek name, we consider ourselves very

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.020
lucky to have this opportunity and we are highly committed to delivering a Star Trek

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.240
experience fans can be proud of.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.600
Yay!

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:04.160
And well, it's not STO, but I like that it's set in the Deep Space Nine universe.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.160
That makes me particularly happy, because Deep Space Nine was my favorite.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.360
Well, it's, you know, TNG was going on at the same time as Deep Space Nine, so it's

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:20.000
probably going to be more focused towards the war, I'm guessing, with the Jem'Hadar.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.720
So that'll be pretty awesome, because that was really a great arc, a great story in the

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.880
Star Trek universe.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.280
I agree, and it certainly opened up lots of fantastic characterization for all kinds of

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.540
people in the series, so I thought it was fantastic.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:40.920
So moving forward, we've had another visitor come into the room who is not supposed to

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920
be in the room.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.920
You need to go find your mommy.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.920
Please shut the door.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.120
Thank you, Punkin.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.120
Sorry.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.680
She didn't shut the door.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680
She didn't shut the door.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.680
Off with her head!

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.420
Oh, that was Sophie.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.120
That is my cousin-in-law's daughter.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120
Ah.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.280
Yes, we have lots of children over right now.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.800
She was excited about Star Trek, can you blame her?

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.040
She came in wearing my Indiana Jones hat when we were talking about Star Trek, so where

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.040
were we?

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.720
Oh yes, we were over to, um, Twitter Topics, weren't we?

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.680
What do we use for Twitter Topics again?

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680
Journey to Wonderland?

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680
Oh.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.680
Um.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.680
Well, we're using it.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.200
It's Twitter Topic time.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:38.000
I don't have any Twitter Topics, so we forgot to tell them to send Twitter Topics.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I did not forget.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I told them to do the break.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.760
Yeah, we told them in the chat room to send the Twitter Topics, so we do have some Twitter

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760
Topics.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.240
And, uh, let's see.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:56.880
Tigerclaw305 sent us a story about ex-Nintendo sales chief to lead Kidzania's creation of

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.120
kid-sized cities.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.760
So let's see what this is about.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.640
I found the right music.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.200
Ah, that sounds more like it.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200
Now you can continue.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:15.520
Kidzania is creating places for kids to learn about real life jobs and entertain themselves

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.620
in many cities with shopping malls.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:23.840
So I don't know, it sounds kind of like some kind of Second Life type thing.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.600
I don't know.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.640
Second Life equals no life.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.200
Yeah.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:38.640
And Tigerclaw305 also sent that the Just Cause film has been optioned, and the movie script

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:47.200
will be written by Michael Ross, and it will be produced by Adrian Ascaria, and that should

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.200
be kind of cool or probably crappy because video game movies kind of suck.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:57.000
When asked why they decided to make the movie, they said Just Cause.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.600
Well sure, why not?

01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.960
We're gonna make it.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.240
That's the reason, yes.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:08.080
And for the record, Shadowrunner says Fallout Children.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:14.000
Let's see, Jay Jugo says, hey guys, I'd like this new way to present a co-host on the show.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.060
This is a must keep, in caps.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.520
Never forget, in hashtag.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520
Never forget.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.520
Never.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:29.600
Okay, and Spazinator says, in my porn voice, hey, there's a crap ton of new free vids on

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.680
the PSN store right now.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:37.400
I assume that they're also available on XBL too, so what do you think about that?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.400
That sounds hot.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.240
Tigerclaw sent us another story, but we already talked about it, Blizzard banning Starcraft

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.840
2 cheaters.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.840
And DarkKisuke says, wait, what?

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.620
Sexual innuendos in Orange Lounge?

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.620
No way.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.920
Yes way, of course way, duh.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920
Lollipops.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.480
Way way.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:09.740
And Matt Ostrovsky, sorry if I said that wrong, Matt, sent us a story that says, story sounds

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:10.740
too good.

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.740
It might be a scroll.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.080
Oh no.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.880
Yuji Naka wants to work on the Dreamcast 2.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.880
No.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880
Oh yeah.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880
We can dream.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.880
We can dream.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880
That is wrong.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880
We can dream.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880
That's never gonna happen.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.880
We can dream about the Dreamcast.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.880
Waa waa.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:30.880
Poor Dreamcast.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.880
Not gonna happen.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.400
I think one more person sent a Twitter topic.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:43.000
Yes, AlphaKananagram sent us a topic about the Katamari Damacy director and his wife

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.280
starting a new company called Uvula with a low-key website.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.440
And then rather than focusing solely on game development, the company's About Us page details

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.720
a focus on music and video games, adding that we want to widen our limit.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720
Okay.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.520
Widen the limit.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.320
So what could they do to top Noby Noby Boy?

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.320
Hmm.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.360
But you know, I actually still play Noby Noby Boy on my iPhone.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.160
I'm not surprised by this, actually.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.720
He's going to eventually meet girl.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.960
It's just like, I have no brain capacity to think of anything to do, so I'm going to play

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.040
with my little worm person.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.040
It works.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.160
DDR dollar bill says no Dreamcast 2 ever.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
Alas.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.160
Sadness.

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:41.360
Without the extra S. Shenmue 3 on Dreamcast 2, fall of 20, never ever.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.360
Aw.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360
Sadness.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:49.720
But yeah, that will do it for our Twitter topics this week, and if you want to have

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.320
your Twitter topics read by Rob when he is back next week, then send your Twitter topics

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.320
to Rob at at O-L-R on Twitter and he will read them, I'm sure.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:05.720
Maybe we can get Rob, instead of doing a porn voice, he can invite Mr. Spanky.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:11.440
Rob can do one of his voices, which always sound like Rob with kind of a high-pitched

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440
voice.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:19.840
So how about we find a few more topics to discuss?

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.560
I suppose we could.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:28.240
And it's kind of interesting, apparently, of course, it's not unexpected, Sony is going

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.440
after anything that's possibly going to mod the PlayStation 3.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:38.800
Of course, they went after the PS Jailbreak before, and now that that's kind of gone,

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.040
because there's free versions out there, they're now going after other things, including the

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:54.960
PS Groove, the kind of open source device out there, PS Freedom, and Open PS Jailbreak.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:06.160
They are aiming for takedowns, I guess, apparently the website PSX Scene has found some different

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:13.480
things that they've marked exhibits, and they are trying to basically erase the existence

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:19.240
of these, not necessarily the devices, but of these programs, because the devices themselves

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:28.080
can be practically anything nowadays, because they've been adopting the PS Groove to practically

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080
everything.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:40.720
Everything from an iPod to a TI-84 to some old-ass MP3 players, USB development, cards,

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:41.720
just everything.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:46.400
Unfortunately, not PSP, because they were unable to port it over to the PSP, but your

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:56.040
phone, iPhone, Droid, you name it, it can hack the PS3 now.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.240
Your mom can hack a PS3.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.640
They're going to start hack storing brains, because people are always going to think of

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.640
a way to do it.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.080
Yeah, I mean, you can try to stop people from doing that stuff, but where there's a will,

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.520
there's a way, and if they want to hack it, they will.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.520
Exactly.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:21.960
Speaking of hack storing brains, during the Tokyo Game Show event, Q Entertainment head

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:31.040
Tetsuya Mizuguchi unveiled the new component of his upcoming rail shooter, Child of Eden,

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:39.040
and he wants participation from us, and it's for a part of the game he calls the Journey

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:45.160
Project, and he's seeking to build a collection of player-submitted pictures for inclusion

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.480
on the last level of the Child of Eden game.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.740
Mizuguchi says, in this game, the player's mission is to purify everything, even data,

01:17:54.740 --> 01:18:00.260
and this is the final stage of the game, you know, I need the beauty of memories.

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:05.600
So with collected memories of family, friends, and beautiful landscapes, you can get that

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.040
kind of memory with music.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.760
It must be real.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:15.400
Mizuguchi also added, I want to put everybody's credit at the end of the game, yeah.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:20.280
Ubisoft clarified that images can be submitted to the official Child of Eden website through

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.440
November 20th, and any approved photos will be used in the game.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:32.340
I can't even imagine what's going to be submitted by random people.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.840
No buts in the game.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:41.400
We're going to get a lot of gongoro, which would be kind of funny.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.400
What the hell's going on out there?

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.440
Like I said, the cousins are over and they're having a fun time in the front room watching

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:58.760
YouTube videos of the guy singing all of the John Williams themes with his own lyrics.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.600
Actually all about Star Wars.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.600
Okay.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.200
Yeah, some YouTube thing.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.200
Wonderful.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:14.080
Well, we do have a little bit of other news, at least I do, about Medal of Honor, which

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.640
for anyone who tuned into Bobby's show earlier, they know this, or they can read, but they

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:27.920
have decided to change the name of the multiplayer faction Taliban to Opposing Force.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.880
Yeah, they're doing it, as I said, out of respect for those in the military and for

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:41.040
those who have lost family members in the war, and they're trying not to show any disrespect.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:47.280
I sort of have the opinion that they already had this in mind, and this was a ploy to get

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:57.880
a little more publicity, but hey, if they're doing this, I mean, the name Opposing Force

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.160
is kind of unimaginative.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160
Generic much?

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160
Yeah, very generic.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:13.200
Because, I mean, wouldn't Opposing Force all be relative to what force you are opposing?

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.400
They could just call it bad guys, they should just go, bad guys.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.000
Oh no, the bad guys.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.480
Then it's offensive to people who are bad.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480
Oh no!

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480
Ah!

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.000
They should just call it, red team?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Dudes.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Dudes.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Chicks.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.640
But see, then that's just sexist right there.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640
Not really.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.720
I call everyone dudes, so that's not sexist.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.080
If you have chicks to find out in there as well, you just can't do that.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.400
It should be dudes and blokes.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.400
Blokes.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.400
Blokes.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.720
It works.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.000
And it can be a game about fisticuffs instead of guns.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.480
They can box each other and not punch.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480
I don't know.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.040
Maybe it's a little too late, who knows.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.960
But at least they're, they're, they're trying.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.880
Darktads used to be just us versus them.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.320
But I don't want to be them, I want to be us.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
Oh no, I thought we were us.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.400
I'm me.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.400
It's me versus everybody.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400
Die!

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.120
Bah bah bah bah bah.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120
No.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.120
Anyway.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120
Misty says woot blokes.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.120
Yeah.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.800
Alright, well there's some new music games coming out in Japan because, well, that's

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.800
what they do over there.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.480
They release music games.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:40.600
And of course, the sequel to Jubeat, Jubeat.net Append will be coming out, I guess, spring

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.840
of 2011.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:52.080
And also, location tests, I guess, for XG2 are gonna be starting soon as well as Guitar

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.240
Freak's Drummania V7.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.840
That's way too many damn games.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.160
That'll be starting very soon.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:10.000
And they haven't really said exactly when those location tests are actually gonna start.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.440
Same with Jubeat Ripples.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:18.080
That location test, sometime next year, but the only one announced so far is XG2.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.480
Why is it called Knit?

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.760
I don't know.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.440
Why does Konami name anything like that?

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.960
I want a knitting game.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960
Not really.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.960
You can do that with the Wii.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.280
I believe there's Crafting Mama, so.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.280
Oh, okay.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.280
Close enough.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.960
I want Crochet Master.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.400
Ooh-hoo.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.880
You could call it Check My Hook.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:46.880
Womp-womp.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:52.280
To a guy who says, Fancy Nancy.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.280
Fancy Nancy.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.280
Knit for Fancy Nancy.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.280
Oh, dear.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.920
In other news- Yes, please.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:09.200
Well, we all know how weird and perverted the internets can be, and so since the internets

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:15.440
is full of weirdos and perverts, you have to take some measures to make sure that LEGO

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.200
Universe can still be child-friendly.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:24.960
And so NetDevil has recently outlined a couple of measures that they are implementing to

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:32.320
help protect the MMO's younger players, since it is targeted towards kids.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:37.520
And basically, it includes content moderation, which is no surprise to anyone, really.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.360
So you will have to get anything that you make, the name will have to be approved before

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.520
it will go out into the LEGO Universe world.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.960
And the other part is a LEGO Universe ID, which is kind of- it actually sounds a lot

01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:00.640
like Nintendo's friend code system, to where you give your LEGO Universe ID to other people

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.360
outside of the game, and then they can see your creations that you've made even before

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.120
they're approved, so.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:14.800
Protecting the innocent childrens from the weirdos of the internet, yay!

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.120
And later on they will become the weirdos of the internet.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.600
Indeed, but on their own, not without the perversion of other people.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.800
Oh no, no, we can't have that.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.240
Think of the children.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.760
Think of the children and how crunchy they are.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:34.480
Well, it's time for another special segment of the show, this time I will actually use

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.520
the correct music for.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.320
It's time for the mailbag!

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:46.280
And I've got the rubber gloves on, it's bending its stinky self over, and I'm opening the

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.440
bag, and ugh.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.760
This is kind of- because Rob hasn't cleaned out the spam filter like he does for me, so

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.040
there's all kinds of- Read the spam!

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.680
I don't know, read the spam, because I don't really care- there's spam in there about Lady

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.680
Gaga, I should have left it in there for Rob, but I will.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.800
That's so Rob.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800
Rob loves Lady Gaga.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.080
I have started appreciating Lady Gaga a little bit, but-

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.120
Lady Gaga is stalking me.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120
Really?

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:20.560
Ever since I sang Lady Gaga for karaoke one time, now she's following me everywhere and

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.240
she's like in my head.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:31.320
Now when you start busting out the asymmetrical wigs and dresses of meat-

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.480
I don't look enough like Marilyn Manson to pull off any of Lady Gaga's looks.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.560
She was so much prettier before she went- anyway, I'm not gonna get into that.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.560
Greetings, O.L.R.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:45.080
I come to Loki with a non-gaming question that I think he'll have a good answer for.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.080
Ooh.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.080
Alright.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:51.600
Loki, I'm a contractor and my cell phone contract is up.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.520
What would you recommend for me?

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.400
All I want is a family plan with no text, no data, and fifteen hundred plus minutes

01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.880
of phone a month.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.560
I've looked at the big four, didn't know if there's some weird hacker service that I'm

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560
unaware of.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.960
At the moment I'm leaning with T-Mobile because of price.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.080
Loki, can you help a desperate turtle?

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.520
Your loyal turtle and Philly serious turtle.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.440
And disclaimer, Orange Hills Radio is not paid by any of the companies that might be

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.520
mentioned and we should be even if they wanted to pay us.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.520
I don't know.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.120
Honestly, like I have a crap plan that didn't have any of that stuff and it's actually more

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.840
expensive than the plans to have all that stuff, so go fig there.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.200
Just have to really kind of shop it.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:36.360
There's websites and stuff that you can actually, you know, put what you need for your plan

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:42.080
and it will kind of shop everybody and tell you what the most affordable plan for you

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.080
is.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.000
I can't think of the life of me what that website's called, but I know it's out there.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Google.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Well, it's not Google, it's something else.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.800
But you can do that.

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:56.940
I'm planning on getting a phone through Virgin Mobile just because they're twenty-five dollars

01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.700
a month for, you know, three hundred minutes because I honestly use like twelve minutes

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.080
a month if I'm lucky on my phone.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.960
So anything cheaper than that would be awesome.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.960
I was actually looking at a prepaid phone, but I think twenty-five dollars a month with

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.960
no contract would not be that bad.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.820
And plus I can browse the Internet on that if I really want to.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.760
But I'm sorry I texted you earlier.

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.060
I should give you a dollar.

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:21.060
I don't care.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.060
It's all right.

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:26.240
Well, we've got some suggestions from the chat room.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.920
Spazinator says to quote Monty Python, I hate spam.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.960
And that's wrong.

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960
It's I don't like spam!

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.440
There you go.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440
That's how you do it.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.880
SSJ100Matt says T-Mobile sucks and suggests Verizon.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.500
And Ron just suggests go with Sprint.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Great coverage.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500
Dirt cheap.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.160
Virgin also because they're piggybacking on the Sprint network, so.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.600
Spazinator uses Cricut.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.120
I use AT&T because I have an iPhone.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.620
And I basically use everything except the phone to call people.

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.000
I do not call people.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.600
Only if it's necessary.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.160
Because I hate talking on the phone.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.240
I did it way too long for my job.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.240
Ugh.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.080
The only people I like talking to on the phone is like my mom.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.120
Because she's funny and frustrating at the same time.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.080
I'm pretty happy with Verizon myself.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.540
They're a little bit more expensive though, but I get better coverage from them.

01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:21.520
I have no reception for AT&T or Sprint within my house.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.640
And I do with Verizon, so you know, can't go wrong with that.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.120
I noticed that I didn't get as good reception in your house when I visited.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:33.040
Yep, it's AT&T and Sprint both have really crappy reception inside of my house.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.480
The AT&T is pretty good out, at least in Sacramento.

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.520
So the next email comes up from Kamitsuyo.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.760
It says, hi everyone at OLR.

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.200
I think it's time to revisit how Rob is doing on his quest to finish three games this summer.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.800
I haven't heard any talk of it lately.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.880
Considering the summer's over, yeah.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.600
That would be interesting to check out.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.800
Well that actually goes back to another email.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.440
Actually, no, that was the only email that we received that way.

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.680
He had like a list of games that he was going to try to beat.

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:13.960
And well, given that I have one of those, in fact, okay, here's the other email that

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.960
we got.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.800
Someone else actually, oh it's the same guy, he expanded on his email.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.680
I knew someone else had something on it.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.160
Hey everyone at OLR, I've been listening to this show for about three years, it helps

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.920
me get through some long days at work.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:24.920
Thank you.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.360
Anyway, what I'm writing about is an episode at the beginning of the summer when Rob talked

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:32.560
about how he never finishes games and was dedicating himself to finish three games this

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.560
summer.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.320
Haven't heard any progress on this or on the show lately.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:40.360
He has kind of inspired me to play several games to completion, which I have done several.

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.640
Red Dead Redemption, Final Fantasy 13, Darksiders, Alan Wake, and currently working on God of

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.360
War series on PS3.

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.600
Just finished the first, along with a slew of 360 arcade games.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.120
Love the show, keep them coming, look forward to the big 10-year anniversary marathon.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120
Stay black.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.120
Kamitsuyo.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:01.440
And, yeah, one of the games that Rob was supposed to finish was Final Fantasy 13, which is currently

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.880
sitting in my living room, because I'm playing it.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:10.640
Of course I'm also playing the, I'm sitting down with that Avatar game finally, too.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.800
So we'll just have to make Rob fess up next week, won't we?

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800
Yes.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.560
And, last email.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.760
This is from Darkyusuke.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.480
Just had to note, whatever that Japanese game you brought up on Twitter, I swear it was

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.480
a fucking hentai.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.120
Go back and listen for yourself and be the judge, XD.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.720
Hail the FSM, Darkyusuke.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720
And that's it for email.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720
Hmm.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:41.200
Well, if you have any emails you want to send us, it's mailbag at orangeandreo.com.

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200
Send it!

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.720
A couple more final stories here.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.400
Actually, I think you have something that we need to do first.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.160
Hold on, someone just said that the stream went down.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.840
Although I don't think that it did, did it?

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.280
Can you hear us, internets?

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.200
This is a server's down, crap.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.360
Hold on.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.800
That's back online.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:08.800
Is it?

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.800
Yeah.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800
Shoutcast is saying that it's not.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.200
Oh, well.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.200
Hold on.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.840
Who crossed the streams?

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.840
That's funny.

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.560
Well, we'll just let him.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.520
When AMP, it froze, actually.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.520
When AMP froze.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.520
Ah, that sucks.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520
Hold on.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.520
Tara, can you hit the chat room now?

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.520
Yeah.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520
Thanks.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.800
You probably want to make sure that part B saves.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800
Maybe.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:42.520
Save it now, and we'll continue on with part three, if you will.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.520
I need to mark this down.

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.520
3645.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.520
Shit!

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.520
Where's my pen?

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.520
Alright.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.520
What's up?

01:31:51.520 --> 01:32:05.520
Are they hearing us now or something?

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.520
No, I just like Loki's comment.

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520
And scene.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.520
Okay.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:15.520
I'm actually closing down when AMP, hold on.

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:26.520
I'm going to reload it.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:44.520
All games radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520
Yes, we are.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520
Yay!

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520
Hold on.

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.520
I've got to fix this to the right settings.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.520
Okay.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.520
43 encoder.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:04.520
What the hell was it?

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520
Hold on.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.520
44 kilobyte.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.520
96K.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.520
And we should be back.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.520
Are we back?

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.520
Can you hear us, internets?

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.520
Internets, are you there?

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520
Oh, crap.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.520
I forgot.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.520
We can't hear them.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.520
Alright, let us know in the chatroom if you can hear us.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.520
We had a little bit of an issue, which should be resolved now.

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:29.520
And thankfully it only went down during mailbag.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.520
And I got to admit, it is your fault, chatroom.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.520
It really is.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.520
It really is.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.520
We know.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:41.520
And a DDR dollar bill says, I thought the dollocks were next week.

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.520
No, no, no, no.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:46.520
So yeah, from what I understand, it went down during mailbag.

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.520
So we'll make Rob edit it.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.520
Yay!

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:54.520
Okay, so shall we move forward with our little podcast?

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.520
Yes.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.520
Loki, rescue us.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.520
Actually, you can't rescue us right now.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.520
You know why?

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.520
It's at the use of the week.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.520
Just in time for the stream to go down, huh?

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.520
Timing is impeccable.

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.520
Yes, it is.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:35.520
My F.U. of the week goes to the stream for going down while I was busy paying attention

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.520
to other things.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.520
And for Rob going to Club 33 without me.

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.520
Bitch.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.520
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.520
Loki.

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:51.520
F.U. to my headache that I've had for two days now.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.520
And it just won't go away.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.520
It's lack of sleep, really.

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.520
But I've been trying to get sleep and just can't.

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.520
You have a small person.

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.520
Well, it's not even, yeah.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.520
It's a little bit him.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.520
Actually, it's all him.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.520
So, yeah, it's been very tiring to say the least.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.520
And, yeah.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.520
So that's F.U. to that.

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.520
F.U. to the crappy drivers.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:22.520
I literally saw somebody pass somebody on the right within the same lane on my way here.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.520
And I was just like, really?

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520
Really?

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.520
You just did that?

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.520
You're in that much of a hurry that you need to pass somebody in the same lane on the wrong

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520
side?

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.520
Awesome.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520
Thank you.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.520
And F.U. to scammers.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.520
By the way, that brings us to our favorite, well, my new favorite topic, which is shoutouts

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.520
to people on AOL Instant Messenger.

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.520
In fact, we have somebody that you probably should give a shoutout to and let them know

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.520
that they should really do the right thing.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:59.520
And that person would be PimpinTyler146 on AOL Instant Messenger.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:03.520
I will be posting his name in the chatroom and Twitter.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.520
Be sure to give him a nice little hi because he is a douchebag that didn't come through

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:11.520
on his end of the transaction.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.520
So, I'm sure he'd love to hear from all of you.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.520
Tara, do you have any F.U.s?

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.520
Yes, I do.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.520
F.U. to my work.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:25.520
Because not only am I working my normal shift, which is 9 to 6, not bad.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.520
But I'm also now working these extra days where I'm working until midnight or 1 a.m.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:38.520
And it's really messing up my sleep schedule and they don't want to pay me overtime.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:41.520
And on next Sunday I get to work from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:47.520
And that really, really sucks and I did not sign on for this and so F.U. my work.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.520
Don't they have to pay you overtime if you work more than a certain amount of hours?

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.520
No, because I'm salary.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.520
Oh, that sucks.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.520
But they don't want to give me any incentives either.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.520
They just want to do this stuff and it's like this is not part of my job description.

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.520
So, it's very upsetting.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:12.520
Well, that sucks. I hope there's some improvement soon.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:22.520
Well, now that the F.U.s are over and we're full of angst that we have now released onto the unsuspecting internet,

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.520
Loki, do you have another story for us?

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.520
Of course I do.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.520
And it's funny since you mentioned release.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:38.520
There is going to be a brand new peripheral coming to the Nintendo Wii remote.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:45.520
Unfortunately it is not something that is, say, approved by Nintendo.

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.520
Or even something that you would, say, use with a Nintendo game.

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.520
We've covered this.

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.520
Yes, but they finally actually are going to be releasing them now.

01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:04.520
But these are Nintendo Wii remote accessories that are kind of...

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.520
They're for dildonics basically.

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:11.520
It's two different peripherals to use.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.520
And what the main function of this, obviously, is actually for chatting over the web.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.520
They're using the Wii remotes as kind of a Bluetooth adapter so that these things can vibrate.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:29.520
And you can remotely vibrate them across the web using, I guess, different programs.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.520
It's the Mojo Wejo is what it's actually called, the company.

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:43.520
And I believe that they said they're going to be supporting a bunch of different chat applications.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:47.520
And I'm sure their own chat application as well.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.520
Is that what they're calling it these days?

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:54.520
In the beta stage right now, but it'll be available for purchase in time for holiday season 2010.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.520
God, I would not want to be part of that beta test.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.520
I had to link a copy of that image in the chat room,

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.520
but I think it's funny that there's a whole YouTube video describing how it's supposed to be used.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.520
It's intensely hilarious.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.520
Indeed.

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.520
Intensely hilarious.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.520
I don't know. Even the name is just too ridiculous for me.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.520
Mojo Wejo.

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.520
Mojo Wejo. See, even porn voice doesn't make Mojo Wejo sound good.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.520
No, it doesn't. And your porn voice is excellent.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.520
Thank you.

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.520
You're welcome.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:45.520
Moving on, away from the porns, former Sega man Yuji Naka is working on an action game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 with Prope.

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.520
And he hasn't revealed what the game is yet, but he will soon.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:40:03.520
So according to Naka, they are doing a few quite big action game projects at Prope, but he didn't tell us anything about them.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.520
He did say that a very original action game based in the sky will be revealed within this month.

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:13.520
So that's something to look forward to.

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.520
I hope it has airships. Yay, airships!

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.520
I wonder if it's going to be Skies of Arcadia.

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.520
Ooh, maybe.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.520
Could be.

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:25.520
It's based in the sky and it involves airships.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.520
Indeed.

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:33.520
Well, we will know soon according to Naka-san, right?

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.520
Yes, soon. Within this month, they are going to tell us about his project.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:45.520
Well, that should hopefully be cool. I don't think Yuji Naka's done anything that's really sucked that bad.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:57.520
So, now it is time for a special part of the show where you, the caller, get to come and speak to us if we can get it to work.

01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:00.520
So I'm going to go ahead and make this disclaimer right now.

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:10.520
Because we do have Tiara in through Skype, I'm going to try to get these to work as a conference call so we don't have to disconnect on her.

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:19.520
So, I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now and go ahead and make your calls.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.520
I'm not going to play any music.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.520
Call!

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.520
Ah, yes.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.520
This is while we do the waiting game. Hi, Dan!

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.520
Riveting.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.520
It is riveting.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.520
Hey, we got a call. I'm going to answer.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.520
Hello, you're talking to Orange Lounge Radio. Who is this?

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.520
This is DJ Blaziken.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.520
Hi, DJ Blaziken. How are you?

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:58.520
I'm doing fine and I just found a solution for all DSI owners that might be listening in.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:07.520
I found this out through the internet and through the grace of it because I don't know if any of you guys have had this problem,

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:13.520
but I have and I'm sure there might be a few others that might have had this.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:23.520
The L and R buttons becoming not able to be fixed when hit and you'd have to end up coming through mashing them in.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:31.520
Well, but the thing is, the little gap that lets it go down is basically letting dust in.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:37.520
Basically, best bet, take a little mini vac or whatever you have to suck the dirt out and do exactly that.

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:44.520
It's supposed to, actually it's made my DS work again. Fully functional again.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:52.520
Well, thank you for sharing the tip with us. I'm glad it's worked for you. I'm sure other people have had similar issues.

01:42:52.520 --> 01:43:01.520
Yeah, and other than that, my original DS, well the second DS that I've ever owned,

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:10.520
started to completely fail on me and ended up spending, well going broke really on a new DS Lite

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.520
and it was actually the last one in the batch, but it was well worth it.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:23.520
With Pokemon HeartGold, which is kind of a, I don't know, basically just HeartGold with the crystal and yellow features

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.520
sort of slapped into it with new DS graphics.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.520
Well, that's pretty cool, but I'll tell you what, we're getting other calls in, so I need to go ahead and let you go.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.520
Thank you for calling.

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.520
Otherwise, I do give it a 10 out of 10.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:37.520
Okay, thank you for calling. Bye bye.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.520
Shut up. I think that was DS Master.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:49.520
And I am super professional. Oscar says I'm super professional. Let's make sure that we haven't,

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:58.520
I'm gonna see if I can't get Marin off of, off of, are you there?

01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.520
Yes, I am.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.520
Okay, so this is what we're gonna do now for future calls.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:09.520
I want people to, um, I'm gonna add the conference. Aha! It worked.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.520
Hello, who are we talking to?

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.520
Quark, anyway, hello you, across the ocean.

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.520
Hello, AK Ripper, how are you?

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:25.520
I'm doing just fine on this Monday morning.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.520
And we do have Tara on the line still too.

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.520
Monday morning? Are you from the future?

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.520
No, I just live in this place called Sweden.

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.520
Ooh, Sweden.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.520
Where I'm all like, I'm like, well, what is it? I'm eight hours ahead of you.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.520
That means you are from the future.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.520
You are from the future.

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.520
What's the future like?

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.520
Our future is Swedish.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.520
Are there flying cars? Tell us, I must know.

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.520
No, no, nothing of that yet. Unfortunately.

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.520
But since you're in Sweden, you have awesome chocolate, right?

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:09.520
Um, no, I don't, no, no, no, no, you're thinking of like Switzerland or...

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.520
What does Sweden have that's awesome? Tell us about Sweden.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.520
What do we have that's awesome? Well, we, ahem...

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:26.520
Oh, that's like, we have, what do we have? Well...

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.520
Damn!

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.520
Prostitution?

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.520
Oh, okay.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.520
No, no, no, no, that's legal actually.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.520
Hot hookers!

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.520
No, no, that's legal.

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.520
We have prostitution in Las Vegas.

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.520
No, that's Amsterdam, sorry.

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.520
Oh, whatever.

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.520
But anyways, what's on your mind, dude?

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:49.520
Oh, well, ahem, what do I call? Oh, well, something of some sort.

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.520
Crap.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.520
Oh, yeah, you forgot to talk about something.

01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:02.520
Dragon Age Ultimate Edition is coming, is coming soon.

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:06.520
Well, somewhere around December or something.

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.520
And, well, the funny thing is that I've just been reminded.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.520
I did buy Dragon Age on launch day and I haven't played it.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.520
The reason I've just been reminded is that I play it on a PC and...

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.520
Funny story is that my computer that I play it on, you can unlock it.

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:31.520
You can unlock all the four cores since two of them is disabled by default of sorts.

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:36.520
And that makes Dragon Age load up pretty fast.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:43.520
But then the two cores was really faulty, so I had to disable them.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:52.520
And then I was like, I don't want to play this slow loading game, so I'm going to play it when I have a quad core.

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:57.520
And I still don't have a quad core, so I'm just going to wait even more.

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:03.520
I think you should just suck it up and play the game, because Dragon Age Origins is an awesome game.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.520
It's the best game ever and you're really missing out.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:13.520
See, you have Dragon Age Origins in Sweden, that's what you have, but you're neglecting it.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:23.520
Well, to be honest, I'm playing that thing called Sims 3 and I'm eagerly waiting nightlife.

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:28.520
Yeah, that's going to be fun. I'm probably going to get it well after everybody else has had it.

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:34.520
The chatroom also would like to inform us that Sweden has Ikea.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:43.520
Yeah, but the part where I live in Sweden, we don't.

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:55.520
We have it, but I have to go like, well, what is it? 250 kilometers or something?

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.520
That's a distance.

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:57.520
Yes, it is.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.520
We've also been informed about Roxette, Ace of Base, and Abba.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.520
So, since Sweden has lots of stuff, how come you don't know this?

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:18.520
Well, because I'm like one of those, in some way, uneducated bastards that lives in a cave of sorts.

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.520
That's okay, you're like the rest of us.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:29.520
Where we live in our caves called our computer rooms and don't come out except when we need to eat and go to the bathroom.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.520
Yeah, that's one up on this one, too.

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:44.520
So, I have a challenge for you. By the end of the month, you must start Dragon Age Origins.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520
Yes, that is the challenge.

01:48:46.520 --> 01:49:08.520
Well, in one way, I've been reminded. I have played a few of the origin stories, and then afterwards I just get bored by some strange reason.

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.520
So, you have gamer ADD?

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.520
Yeah, well, and I actually have real ADD, too.

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.520
That would contribute.

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.520
If we ought to go that way.

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.520
That would contribute.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.520
Well, AkiRipper, I appreciate the call.

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.520
Are we doing okay without Rob?

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:46.520
Yeah, you're doing just fine. Because, well, in some way I would say, more of this in the future, please, even though it's like, sorry, Rob, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.520
Yeah, that's the way in. Yeah, something.

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:56.520
I don't know, I'm just this worthless foreigner of whatever.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:03.520
Oh, you are not a worthless foreigner, we adore you. But we need to go ahead and let you go, we've got another call coming in, okay?

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.520
Yeah, later.

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.520
Take care.

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.520
Bye-bye.

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:13.520
Hello, caller. You are on Orange Jones Radio. Who be thee?

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:16.520
I be DDR Dollar Bill.

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.520
Hi.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:21.520
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill. What's on your mind?

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:31.520
Oh, not much. I just want to give an update about the PlayStation 3 that I got a couple weeks back, that I finally purchased it.

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.520
Yay!

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.520
Yeah.

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.520
Congrats.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.520
What's that?

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.520
I said congrats.

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:45.520
Oh, thanks, thanks. It's, it makes a nice little, it's, it's a lot better to watch DVDs on that, to give you that much.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:50.520
But the move, I didn't like it at all.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:58.520
I found out that you asked for me, I actually have to be about six feet away from the TV, and unfortunately, I don't have that much room in my apartment.

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.520
Oh, that sucks.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:10.520
Yeah, so, I mean, I went forward, and it would, it stopped detecting, and I was only like maybe four feet away from the screen, and I said, uh, no, this is not gonna work.

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:15.520
Is there any way that you could wall-mount, like, a receptor or something?

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.520
I have, well...

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:20.520
I think you should mount it onto your ceiling.

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:24.520
That's at least six feet away. Right?

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:28.520
I'd have to lay down on the floor to do that, though.

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.520
I'd be laying on the floor waving my stick.

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.520
Wait, that doesn't look right at all.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:36.520
Well, then...

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:49.520
Yeah, but, uh, just wanna save that, and I've got a lot of enjoyment out of it for one big reason. No fucking batteries on the controllers.

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:56.520
It was such a play, I enjoyed just actually plugging the controllers, get it going. Alright, we got multiplayer.

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.520
That's always a plus.

01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:08.520
Yeah, so, so let's, oh, hold on a second. There we go, I'm sorry, I was hearing myself repeat myself.

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.520
You had to do what to yourself?

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:14.520
No, I was hearing my voice come in an echo, I was like, why?

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:19.520
Maybe, maybe you've got your, you're too close to your speakers or something to that effect?

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:22.520
You have to be at least six feet away.

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:27.520
You must be at least six feet away to enjoy this podcast.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:34.520
Yeah, so, the biggest hits so far in the household is LittleBigPlanet and ModNation Racers.

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:39.520
How do you like ModNation Racers? I've been meaning to play that.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:44.520
Okay, before we go into it, I'm gonna say this again, this is just a disclaimer.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:50.520
I thought Super Mario Kart on the SNES was the biggest piece of shit that ever existed.

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:57.520
I'm sorry, I thought the controls sucked horribly and the perspective just, I couldn't play it.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.520
I had to wait till the N64 version just to even be able to play it.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:06.520
But for ModNation, what I loved about it is that anybody could pick it up.

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:10.520
Anybody could pick up and guide us to the game right away.

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:15.520
Well, that's always a plus with a game. I think that if it's a game that's that simple to play,

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.520
then it's definitely better to get more people in on it too.

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:27.520
Oh, exactly. Especially when they can't just design their own characters and cars and even tracks.

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:33.520
When they start doing the tracks, that's gonna be a lot more fun because we can just recreate anything we want.

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:38.520
Especially around New York, we got no shortage of tracks to replicate.

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.520
So, I need to ask you something. As a dude, I have to ask you this.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:49.520
What is it about being able to customize your characters? Isn't that a lot like Barbie dolls for dudes?

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:56.520
Like, okay. When we have all these wrestling games and my husband would try to make the wrestlers look all cool and stuff,

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.520
I'm like, dude, it's like you're playing dress up.

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:01.520
It really is.

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:05.520
In essence, you're half way right. It is kind of like doing Barbie.

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.520
But it's manly Barbie.

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.520
And wrestling is like soap opera for dudes.

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.520
It is.

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.520
Oh, no disagreements.

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.520
Oh, they got her drunk and they got married. Oh no.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.520
Triple H. Sorry.

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:26.520
Look, I'm coming back from the dead again.

01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:31.520
Oh, now it's the under biker.

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.520
No, he's back to Undertaker, like the dead guy again. He was a biker for a while though.

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.520
The under biker was. Now we're on wrestling, sorry.

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.520
It's alright. He lost tonight anyway.

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:47.520
Oh, really? It's been that long. I'm like, I don't know who any of these people are anymore.

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.520
That's terrible that they wrote that into the script, that he would lose.

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:54.520
He lost by getting hit with the urn.

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.520
What?

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.520
They wrote that all back in there. They're going way back.

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.520
Wow.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.520
They went backwards.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:09.520
Given that I remember playing WrestleMania in the arcade, and you could choose the Undertaker.

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:12.520
When I was a kid.

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.520
Oh, yeah.

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:16.520
The under biker needs to retire.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.520
You're not the only one who's saying that.

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:30.520
Well, anyway, thank you for clearing this up for me because I've always wondered if it's just the same sort of little giddy joy in making them look pretty.

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.520
Like pretty, pretty ponies.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:39.520
Just to add to it, in the wrestling games, it's also a joy now where you can actually create your own finisher.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.520
So now it's not just, ooh, you look pretty. Like, ooh, I can kick your ass pretty.

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.520
That's... I've never heard someone say, I can kick your ass pretty.

01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:51.520
I don't know. Just a moment of thought.

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:55.520
Did you ever play WrestleMania 2000 on Nintendo 64?

01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.520
Yes.

01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:03.520
We made this guy who was part of G Generation X and we would just put him on watch mode and he beat everybody.

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:09.520
He won every belt, including the women's belt.

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.520
Oh, gosh. When the AI was actually that easily manipulative. Nice.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:19.520
Exactly. Anyway, this isn't wrestling chat. This is Orange on Radio.

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.520
Agreed. Video games, but...

01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.520
Are you sure about that?

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:27.520
We talked about food in part A. We did already get our food out of our system.

01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:32.520
That sounds bad. That's more like what we do during the break is get our food out of our system.

01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:35.520
Speaking of which, I got my pizza here to eat too.

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.520
Why don't we let you get to your pizza?

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.520
What kind of pizza do you have?

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.520
Take care.

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.520
Alright, you too. Bye.

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.520
Bye bye.

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.520
Ah, pizza and wrestling.

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:52.520
So reminds me of my early years with my husband.

01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.520
How romantic.

01:56:54.520 --> 01:57:01.520
Well, you know how we got engaged was watching UHF and drinking Manischewitz wine, which should have set a precedence there.

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.520
Yep.

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:10.520
So do we have any other callers? Because if you don't, I'm closing the line and you're all SOL.

01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.520
Five, four...

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.520
Misty is supposed to call. Call Misty.

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:25.520
Misty, call. You must call. You must call. Or we'll call you. Conferencing you in in just about a minute. Are you on?

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:30.520
Ooh, she's sneaky.

01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:33.520
I do not see her in the list of people who are on the lines.

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.520
Aww.

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:40.520
Oh, there we go. Let's see.

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.520
Nope, I do not see a Misty.

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.520
Call us.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.520
Call us.

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:51.520
Oh, we got another one in, but it's not Misty. Let's see who this is.

01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:57.520
Hello, you're on Orange Jones Radio. Who are you whoring yourself out today?

01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.520
I'm whoring myself to whoever has the highest amount of money for me.

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.520
Oh baby, oh baby.

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.520
Hi Rhonda.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:06.520
Hey, hey, what's up?

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.520
Hi Ron-Chan.

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.520
My Ron-Chan, oh hi.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.520
Let me see what you did there.

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:15.520
No, I do try.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.520
How are you doing today?

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:27.520
I am doing good. Would you believe I just finished, I just finished editing my podcast to get it and it's...

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:30.520
Huh?

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.520
Did you cut it out?

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.520
Oh, here we go. Sorry about that. I hit the mute button by accident.

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:43.520
Remember, don't hit the mute button. Never hit the mute button because then you'll end up sounding like this while you're trying to talk.

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.520
No, and we can't have that now.

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:48.520
No.

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:59.520
Just finished editing our podcast and it just went up blind and I'm looking at all the emails of all the gaming demos that's going on at New York Anime Festival slash Comic Con this weekend.

01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:02.520
Ooh, do tell.

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:07.520
Okay, first email I got is from the people behind DC Universe.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:10.520
Ooh.

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:17.520
And which is also interesting, the Marvel Superhero MMO will be playable as well.

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.520
Yay.

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:25.520
I'm looking at a graphic of it. It's pretty much, it's the Marvel Superhero Squad online game. Looks interesting.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:29.520
Oh, that's cute. That should be adorable.

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:35.520
Definitely. And I also got an email from Sega so they'll be showing up on the new Thor game.

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:37.520
Oh, cool.

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:45.520
And I am curious about DC Online because this will be the second time I've ever played a PS3 in my entire life.

01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.520
Really?

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:53.520
Yeah, first time I played it was at some gaming con. I played around with Street Fighter IV. Only thing that annoyed me was the load time.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.520
Yeah.

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:58.520
I much prefer that on Xbox.

01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:05.520
It's funny though, I only bought Street Fighter IV only because I know the person that does the voice of Ryu in the game.

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.520
Really?

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.520
Yes.

02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:12.520
Who is it? I mean, what other stuff has he done that I would recognize?

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:17.520
His name is Kyle Hebert, and did you ever watch the dub Dragon Ball Z?

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:20.520
I tried not to, but I have it sometimes.

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:22.520
He did the voice of adult Gohan.

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:23.520
Oh.

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:24.520
Oh, okay.

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.520
He was actually one of the ones that wasn't annoying.

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.520
Mm-hmm.

02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:33.520
Of the very few that were not annoying, he was one of them.

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.520
Yeah.

02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:45.520
He wasn't the older adult Gohan when Viz and Pioneer dubbed it. He was part of the Funimation cast when they redubbed the series.

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:53.520
Yeah, I think I pieced it together when you said it because I remembered Ryu's English voice.

02:00:53.520 --> 02:01:02.520
Okay, and that end, I don't remember how many episodes they dubbed it before Funimation took over. It's just like a giant blur to me.

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.520
Dragon Ball Z is a giant blur to me.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:16.520
Well, with Dragon Ball Kai, which is supposed to be more of the manga-based version, or I like to call it Dragon Ball Z Kai, less filler refs, still tastes great.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.520
That's pretty funny.

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.520
So the battle with Cell only takes like five episodes instead of 73?

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.520
Pretty much. Pretty much.

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:38.520
Seriously, when I had my fan subs of the Cell episodes, they were seriously over four VHS tapes at whatever the long play was. SLP.

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:40.520
Wow.

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.520
Yeah. That's way too much.

02:01:42.520 --> 02:02:05.520
I remember the first time I watched the fans of Dragon Ball Z. Me and my cousin were at his grandmother's house watching it, and it was third or fourth generation VHS tape because as we're watching it, the video quality was so bad that it would just flip to blue screen every three minutes, and we're just sitting there glued to the TV, watching every single minute of it.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:09.520
That sounds like my first experience is watching Ranma 1-1-2.

02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:17.520
When my first copies were fan subs from the Ranma project, about four, five generations old.

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:27.520
I remember that. I remember there was this comic book shop I used to periodically hang out at, and they actually had the fan sub copies.

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:34.520
But the thing is, I liked the price of these often. It was like two episodes for like 20 bucks. I'm like, nah, that can stay on the shelf.

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.520
I remember the old days when you traded fan subs.

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.520
I remember that.

02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:42.520
Ah, memories.

02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.520
I still have all my fan subs in storage.

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.520
Now we download them off the internet.

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:52.520
Shh, shh, don't say that. We're not supposed to.

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:55.520
How else am I gonna get my Digimon fix?

02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:57.520
Well, did you know they actually-

02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:59.520
I'm watching the new series of Digimon.

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:01.520
Do you know they actually re-fan subbed on Digimon?

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.520
Uh, don't know.

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.520
Eh.

02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.520
Don't get me started.

02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.520
So how about more video games?

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.520
I do butterfly, the opening theme.

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:15.520
How about more video games? What else is gonna be up there?

02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:19.520
That's basically it. That's all the information I have here.

02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.520
Also, there's another company called Game Tech that's supposed to be there.

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:32.520
They're probably doing these little flash-based games or something like that. That's my assumption.

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:34.520
They're not saying too much about it.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:40.520
They're gonna be the Kenshiya Hall of your convention.

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:53.520
To be perfectly honest, the Kenshiya Hall of Comic Con is like the little room in the back where it's open gaming and then people try to get up on stage and make fools of themselves.

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.520
That's always the best part of cons, is people making fools of themselves. In costume!

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.520
Oh, I'll definitely be in costume.

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.520
So what's your cosplay this year?

02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:12.520
Speaking of in costume, I am looking for pieces for a River Song cosplay from the end of the last Doctor Who series.

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:19.520
So if you know somebody who can help me out with finding some pieces for that, I would be much appreciative.

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:28.520
I'm probably the minority in my group that does not watch Doctor Who, only because I have so much stuff on my plate to watch I have no time for it.

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:31.520
Tisk, tisk, tisk.

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.520
Hey, if it helps, I watched some of the original stuff from the 60s and the 70s.

02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.520
That's what I grew up on.

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:40.520
Yeah, on public access.

02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:42.520
Fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:59.520
Okay, well if Ron Chan can't help me, somebody on the interwebs that is hearing this, the tens of people who listen to this show, there are a lot, so if you would like to help me out with some River Song cosplay so that I can go to the Laguna Beach Comic Con.

02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:03.520
Is that the one? No, I'm going to Long Beach Comic Con at the end of this month, so...

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:06.520
In the old home of Onomatopoeia Expo.

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.520
Yes.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:17.520
Oh, I remember that place, and I remember walking all over that section of Long Beach in four inch platform heels. Not fun.

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.520
Not smart.

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.520
No, but I was cosplaying.

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.520
Kinda sexy.

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:25.520
But for the record, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary.

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.520
Okay.

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.520
Ah.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:33.520
Hence the boots and walking around in wings in a crowded dealer's room. Not smart. I didn't do it again.

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:43.520
Well, Tiara, I can't say this much, but I actually do know a couple of people out in the Vegas area that are cosplayers, so I may be able to cash in a favor or two.

02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:55.520
Um, if one of them is somebody that I think it is, that might be a creepy person from high school that I went to high school with, so maybe not.

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.520
Male or female?

02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.520
Male.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:03.520
You're in luck, they're all females. Most of the cosplayers I know and commissioners are female, so you're good.

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:05.520
Okay, good. Okay, good.

02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:08.520
I got you, I got you.

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.520
No creeps for you today.

02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:13.520
Yay, one day creep free.

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.520
Except when DS Master called in.

02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:20.520
Well, I missed that call, so...

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.520
That's right, you were on hold.

02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:23.520
Yep.

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:29.520
Well, Ron-Chan, thank you for your call, and you need to get your ass back out here soon.

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:36.520
As soon as I get some cash monies, me and Joe there and Missy will come out there and invade for a weekend or two or three.

02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:40.520
Or everybody compile and get me out there, because I don't want to be in California.

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.520
Yeah, I want to go to New York.

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:46.520
Yeah, we need to make the Send Jamie and Tiara to New York fund.

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:55.520
Yeah, and DDR dollar bill said I should ship myself there, but I don't know how many air holes I would need, so I'm not sure if that would work.

02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:56.520
Thirty-two.

02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.520
Thirty-two, okay.

02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:05.520
Not to mention that they put you in one of those non-compressed compartments and you'll freeze to death, so that's not good.

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:07.520
Yeah, that would kind of suck.

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.520
Oh hey, Loki, when did you show up?

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:10.520
Oh, I've been here.

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:11.520
Oh, okay.

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.520
He's been looking up porn and playing the magical unicorn fart game.

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.520
I've been doing either of those, but yes.

02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:21.520
That would explain why the stream went out. Bad Loki. Bad Loki.

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:24.520
No, it went out from spam overload from the email.

02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:26.520
Eat.

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:27.520
Yeah.

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:30.520
So, do you have anything else for us?

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:33.520
Give us more.

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.520
No, that's pretty much it, yeah.

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:40.520
Alright, well we are going to let you go. Reluctantly, reluctantly.

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:41.520
We love the mall.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:44.520
So, take care, and thank you for calling in.

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.520
Will do.

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.520
Anytime.

02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:47.520
You are fantabulous.

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:48.520
Bye-bye.

02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:49.520
Bye.

02:07:49.520 --> 02:08:03.520
Okay, I think that we're about called out. I'm going to leave room for one more call, and if not, then we'll go ahead and ask for any last-minute stories and wrap the show up in ribbons and bows and call it pretty.

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:05.520
Yay, so pretty.

02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:09.520
Shadowrunner says someone should cosplay Billy Mitchell.

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:21.520
You know what, all that makes me do is when I hear the scout doing the slap shop commercial.

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:24.520
Hold on, somebody fill time.

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.520
Time fill, woo.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:29.520
Oh, I know. It's Misty's birthday, so.

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.520
We should say happy birthday to Misty.

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:39.520
Happy birthday, Misty. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Misty, happy birthday to you.

02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:44.520
Yay, now send us cake. Fresh, fresh cake.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.520
Yes, cake. Or cupcakes.

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.520
I love cupcakes.

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:49.520
Me too.

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:55.520
Oh, wait, wait, wait, Rama's telling everyone to tell Jevdea to call in and do coffee talk.

02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:59.520
Coffee talk with Jamie and Tiara.

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:05.520
Give us a call, we'll talk. No big whoop.

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:09.520
That Madonna is such a skank.

02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:12.520
That was my favorite coffee talk.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:17.520
With Madonna and Roseanne Barr and then Barbara showed up.

02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:20.520
Because she's like, butta.

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:27.520
Okay, I'm still trying to find this, hold on.

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.520
I can't find it. Where is it?

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:35.520
Shadowrunner says the cake is a lie, but pie is constant. This is true.

02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:37.520
That is true.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:41.520
Pie is constant.

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.520
I can't spell today.

02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:46.520
Well, last minute stories, I guess.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.520
Yes, please.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:51.520
Retailers are apparently listing Duke Nukem Forever for February 1st.

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.520
I can tell you right now that's just an estimate because they haven't really given up the exact release date yet.

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:01.520
I'm assuming it's February, though, because we have it listed in February as well.

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.520
But not the 1st, because that would be wrong.

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:10.520
Well, here, I've loaded this up. Oh, we've got another call coming in, hold on.

02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:12.520
Let me add them to our call.

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:16.520
Hello, you're calling in Orange Falls Radio. Who is this?

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.520
This is Jevdea.

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.520
Hi!

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.520
Hello!

02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.520
You've called! Now we can talk!

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:31.520
We can talk, so we can have...

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.520
We can discuss.

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.520
We can hasing.

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.520
So how are you?

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:47.520
I'm well. My nose hurts.

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.520
Why did your nose hurt?

02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.520
I pierced my system.

02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.520
Fun!

02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.520
That sounds about as fun as putting a hole in your face.

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:02.520
Something like that.

02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.520
Why did you go and do a silly thing like this?

02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:11.520
I had the time and I had the money.

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.520
If you've got the time and money, you should just come out here!

02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:16.520
Exactly.

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:17.520
No!

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:19.520
It's less painful!

02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:25.520
I was on a weekend vacation at a barbecue competition thing.

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.520
It was at the beach, so I did it.

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.520
It's the weekend that's not being able to go out to California.

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.520
Everybody else put holes in their noses with you, too?

02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:39.520
Oh, I guess you did.

02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:43.520
So, what's going on on your gaming front?

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:48.520
I'm actually trying to play through the Lego games again.

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.520
Oh, yay!

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.520
I'm trying to play through Batman now.

02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:56.520
Lego Batman is so much fun. I love that game.

02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:58.520
It absolutely is.

02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:01.520
No! I'm having so much fun with it.

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.520
And it's just absolutely ridiculous.

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:09.520
It's fantastic, innocent fun.

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:12.520
I think Lego Indiana Jones is still my favorite, though.

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.520
But I have a soft spot for Indy.

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:18.520
Even though he's old and walking around with a cane.

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:21.520
Yeah, I had that for the DS.

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:23.520
And I liked it on DS.

02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:26.520
I had Batman for the DS, too, and I played that like crazy.

02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:29.520
So now I'm just trying to get through everything on the 360.

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.520
Did you play through Arkham Asylum?

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.520
No, I haven't. I do not have it.

02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:39.520
I'm trying to wait for it to come down in price and find it down at price.

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:42.520
If I can find it cheap, I will send you a copy.

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:43.520
$39.99.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:46.520
If I can find it cheap and use it somewhere, I will find you a copy.

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:48.520
Okay.

02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.520
It's really worthwhile.

02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:56.520
In fact, I think I saw it at one of our local used music and game stores

02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:01.520
for like 20, I want to say.

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:04.520
We'll work out something after the show. You can PayPal me.

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:07.520
Okay. All right. That sounds good.

02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:10.520
Even though I still have to send a sound board to Tiara.

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.520
Oops.

02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.520
I still have stuff to mail you, too, so it's okay.

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:18.520
And you only sound vaguely Atlantean.

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.520
Yes.

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:26.520
Well, I totally suggest the Arkham Asylum game. It's pretty fun.

02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:28.520
You can also just go around.

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:32.520
The best thing to do in that game is to get up on the gargoyle heads in some of these areas

02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:36.520
and then drop down behind people upside down all crazy-like.

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.520
You pick them up and beat the crap out of them and drop them down.

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.520
It's just awesome badminton.

02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:42.520
It sounds fun.

02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:43.520
I know.

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.520
See, that's the kind of stuff that I do in Metal Gear.

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:48.520
I just go up behind people and just strengthen them.

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.520
Snap their necks.

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.520
See, now in my head I've got Rob's voice going,

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.520
LOL, you're dead.

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:59.520
That's the kind of crap that I do in video games, though.

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:00.520
I like that stuff.

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520
You like the ninja.

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.520
Yes. Yes.

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.520
I think that makes me a little violent, though, but that's okay.

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.520
Oh, there's nothing wrong with that. You have to blow off steam somehow.

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:13.520
Yeah, exactly.

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.520
So I do it on video games.

02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:18.520
And two people. And nice one did that.

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.520
Because we know the difference between gaming and reality.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.520
And as much as we imagine doing it to people in real life,

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:27.520
we do not actually do it.

02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:31.520
No, we just wish that the video games were real sometimes.

02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:34.520
DDRdollarBill says, remind me not to piss her off ever

02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:39.520
and doesn't want to have this next snap silently.

02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:42.520
Yes, let's not do that for reals.

02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:47.520
Or what was the line in Silence Good, but let's play Metal Gear for real.

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:56.520
Alright. Well, do you have anything else that you wish to discuss with us?

02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.520
No, I was just calling in to say hi, basically.

02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:02.520
Well, hello. We're glad that you called.

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.520
Yes, indeed.

02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:05.520
I hope so.

02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.520
Batman!

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:09.520
She's Batman.

02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:12.520
She's Batman.

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:16.520
Well, you take care, and we will end it on Batman.

02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:17.520
Batman!

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:20.520
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na phone call!

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.520
Okay.

02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:27.520
Okay, that's it for Skype.

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:33.520
I'm going to go ahead and go on the Do Not Disturb.

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:36.520
Because I will not answer any more of your insolent questions.

02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:38.520
Do Not Disturb.

02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.520
I will no longer respond to your insolence.

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:45.520
I'm done. Do you have any more last minute stories for us, Loki?

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.520
No.

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:49.520
Tiara, do you have any last minute stories?

02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.520
I do not.

02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:53.520
So how about last minute thoughts?

02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:55.520
Wait, last thoughts. Loki, any final?

02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:58.520
My head hurts. Baby's sleeping right now.

02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:00.520
And that means he's going to be up at night.

02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:05.520
My head hurts even more knowing that I have to get up at probably 3 in the morning this time.

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.520
Time to break out the Vicodin.

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.520
I can't swallow pills, so that doesn't work.

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:15.520
We'll put it on your pizza.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:17.520
I already ate all the pizza.

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.520
Vicopizza.

02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.520
And Tiara, for you, any last minute thoughts?

02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:25.520
Happy Spocktober, everyone!

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:29.520
That makes me all warm and fuzzy and logical.

02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:32.520
And my final thought is...

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:35.520
Taco Salad defeated!

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.520
Dun dun dun!

02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:39.520
Alright, everybody.

02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:45.520
Well, that's been this episode of Orange Lounge Radio's Sans Rob, who never did make an appearance.

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:48.520
How dare he not make an appearance.

02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.520
Good night, everybody!

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:54.520
