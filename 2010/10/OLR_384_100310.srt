00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,520
Tonight, October 3, 2010, NBA Jam goes solo on the 360 and PS3, Sonic 4 gets a release

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:32,760
date, and have big titles this year save the PC gaming industry?

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,520
Hello everybody, this is episode, what are we on again?

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
283.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
283 of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm sorry, 384.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,480
I totally threw a random number there, that's kind of funny, huh?

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
383.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Yeah, 283.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
We went back in time.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,400
Rob's gone and the show has become the TARDIS and we have run back in time.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,160
We're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,520
I got two of the numbers right though, they were just out of order.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
Yes, an O-L-R-G, yes, spazzinator.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:10,120
I am DarkSakra, Jamie Summers, Rob is on a plane, or dead, and then this is Loki, our

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
tech master.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,800
Do you do any tech stuff lately with us?

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,920
I stole some accord the other day out of the box because I need it for something new and

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,800
a home, but other than that, no.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
Okay, well that's close enough.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,560
So as always we start the show with how was your gaming week, and I normally go first

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,280
but I'm not gonna, so you go first.

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,920
Oh, actually, wait, wait, wait, wait, we have one more thing.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
One more thing.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Cough, cough.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Yes.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,080
Sorry, you're not in the room.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,760
We have a special, special, special co-host tonight, and that's Maren Marvel.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Hi, are you ready to talk video games?

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,240
Oh, she broke out the porn voice.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,880
So then why don't we go ahead and start with you for how was your gaming week?

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,200
My gaming week was alright.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,840
I played a lot of WoW, I've gotten back into World of Warcraft after not playing for a

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,800
long time.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,240
And other than that, pretty uneventful, I played some, I like the music games like The

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,640
Lips and The Beatles Rock Band, so I did some of those.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,960
And I've been trying to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years, which came out around

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,320
this time last year on the Wii, and I had started playing it and I just like dropped

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,800
off the face of the earth, and so I started playing it again.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,440
And now I'm at a point where I'm seriously under-leveled for the area I'm at, so I'm

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,720
going to have to go do my least favorite thing, which is grinding and leveling up.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
That was always the thing that I could not stand in World of Warcraft, just because it

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
seemed really monotonous to me.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,080
Yeah, there is that too.

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,440
But now I'm playing a warlock, so I've never played a warlock before, usually I play a

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,480
priest or a druid, so it's kind of fun and different.

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,200
Well it sounds like you're having a good time, and just so that our listeners know a little

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,000
bit more about you, would you like to tell them a little bit about yourself?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,920
My name is Tiara, also known as MaronMarvel, I am semi-famous on the interwebs, but not

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,360
as famous as Sky and Loki in Dark Sakura.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,400
And we'll make you famous.

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah, yay!

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,160
This is all sounding very dirty.

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,160
We have ways to make you famous.

55
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Now we've got you outnumbered, it's estrogen time.

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah, dun dun dun!

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,160
It was always estrogen time here with Robs.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,560
He's gonna go back and edit this and go, what?

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,360
Although it's the truth.

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,880
Okay, well then Loki, how was your gaming week?

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:55,160
I actually didn't play a whole lot, but I did play some stuff on the iPod, and I don't

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,240
know, a lot of it was just disappointing, because I go on these binges where I buy a

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
lot of junk.

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Not even necessarily buy a lot of junk, but I download a lot of apps, and that includes

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,720
a lot of games, especially stuff that's on sale.

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:15,520
So I went ahead and I downloaded, because it was free, Duke Nukem 3D for the iPod or

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,000
iPhone or whatever.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,280
The only problem is I deleted it almost immediately because the controls in it really suck.

69
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,560
Otherwise it's Duke Nukem 3D and it's pretty awesome, but it's just the controls really

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,320
suck, so what's the point?

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,560
Of course, more Plants vs. Zombies, that was a lot of fun.

72
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:43,200
I also played a little bit of the newly released Bit.Trip Beat on the iPod, and the only thing

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,920
I don't like about that game, and it was kind of the same way when it was on the Wii, where

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,880
everything you had to kind of tilt the controller to move your paddle up and down.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,160
Well, you have to tilt the iPod to move your paddle up and down, and I really think it

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,640
would have been a lot better if you could just use the touch screen to move your finger

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
up and down the screen.

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,080
It would be a lot more accurate, and it can ramp up the difficulty or something like that

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,340
because it's just very awkward for me to tilt the stupid screen.

80
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,080
Then non-iPod stuff, I actually tried the demo for Start the Party, which is one of

81
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,920
the PlayStation Move games, because we had friends over and they wanted to see some of

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,680
the Move stuff, and I've got to admit, that game was actually kind of fun, and it kind

83
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,120
of reminds me of the old iToyPlay games, and you might be thinking, oh, iToyPlay, that's

84
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
going to be crap.

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,760
Well, actually, what's kind of cool about it is the fact that with the camera now and

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,440
the motion controllers, you can actually do a lot of the augmented reality stuff.

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,140
For example, most of the games actually in that use augmented reality controls, so you'll

88
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,720
have your motion controller that you're holding, and it actually looks like a tennis racket,

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,480
and you can move it around in any direction that you want, and it basically looks like

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,720
you're holding a tennis racket, and it's very accurate, very fun to play, actually.

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,780
They have a lot of, they had a little round in the game where it kind of switches up games

92
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,560
really quick, kind of like WarioWare, and it was actually quite fun.

93
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,320
So I might actually check out the full version of that if, you know, it would be a good party

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
game or something.

95
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,320
That, and of course, more sports champions play a little bit of that demo as well, because

96
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,800
I still haven't actually gone out to buy any full version Move games yet, because I just

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,400
don't usually play in the PlayStation 3, because it's in the main room, and the wife likes

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
to watch TV and stuff, and there's a baby there, so that kind of makes it difficult.

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,720
Then of course, more, you know, Grand Theft Auto, that stuff every week.

100
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,640
But yeah, I've got Dead Rising 2 and Halo Reach to get to, though, so eventually I'll

101
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
play those.

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm actually looking forward to playing Dead Rising 2, so yeah, it'll be fun.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,760
That's pretty much all I played this week, yeah, so that's it.

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,080
Well, my week was spent with a little Star Trek Online, but I didn't really play a whole

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
lot.

106
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,920
I've had kind of a weird week, and I spent the first half of it kind of sick.

107
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,600
So I did get on some Plants vs. Zombies.

108
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Rob came over on Tuesday night to record part of the intro, and he was so funny playing

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:38,160
Super Metroid, because he was doing his Samus that sounds awfully like Rob voice, going

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,240
ow, well that hurt, and then there's this one part right before you go to fight.

111
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:53,440
Was it Craig, Ridley, or one of the, Craig, Craig, sorry, I don't know what, I was thinking

112
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
of school.

113
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Craig?

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Craig.

115
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
No, Craig.

116
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
That's the wrong game.

117
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Which we did play.

118
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
I know, I know it is.

119
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Which we did play, but I'll get to that next.

120
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,380
But there's this one part where this person is dead and covered in bugs, and the bugs

121
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,640
play off, and Rob's like, LOL you're dead, which I thought was funny.

122
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,240
And then Rob left, and we played Turtles in Time on the SNES, and we beat the game, because

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,420
Dan and I are an awesome team.

124
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,640
So Shredder did not dine on turtle soup?

125
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,040
No, but he kept talking about it, and I'm like, dude, don't you have any original lines

126
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,500
or something?

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:35,020
And so, yesterday I went to play, just because we had to go ahead and go buy this really

128
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:42,080
crappy arcade, I stopped to play Para Para Paradise, which is the first mix plus, and

129
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
it was pretty fun.

130
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,480
I actually remembered how to do three of them off the top of my head, and did a decent job,

131
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,820
and of course, I had four songs to play, so I just redid Night of Fire, because Night

132
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,520
of Fire is fun.

133
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,200
And then came home, and I've played some Sims, and mostly it's just been little bits of gaming

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,340
except for Tuesday night, because I've had school work and other stuff to do, so that's

135
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,780
been my gaming week.

136
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,640
More eventful than usual, but not as, not really all that busy.

137
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,120
My gaming week will be busier soon, once Fable 3 comes out, because I totally pre-ordered

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
that this weekend.

139
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
So you'll be-

140
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Are you going to yell at the dog?

141
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,960
Already for Dance Masters when it comes out, since you've been playing some Para Para,

142
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:34,120
that's all that game really is anyways, or not Dance Masters, it's uh, no it is Dance

143
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Masters.

144
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Dance Masters, yeah.

145
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,160
That's right, because there's Dance Central is the other one.

146
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,840
I wonder if there's going to be actual Para Para in it.

147
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
It is!

148
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,000
That's what the moves are, they're Para Para, they had Night of Fire on there, and it's

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,440
exact same thing.

150
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm totally getting this.

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Dan, we're getting this.

152
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
He's over at my desk.

153
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,120
I do have to get the Kinect though, and that's expensive.

154
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Yeah, that's true.

155
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
But I am getting that.

156
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,560
And I actually probably will pick up this game just for fun, because it's funny.

157
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Dan's over there saying that he's sure that we'll have it.

158
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,560
So as for some general housekeeping, like we've been mentioning, Rob is on a giant cylinder

159
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,960
defying the laws of gravity, although he is making good use of the laws of propulsion

160
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,200
and aerodynamics.

161
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,760
So way to go Rob.

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,400
He's probably up there asleep or playing as Game Boy or something.

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,240
That being said, Rob will probably not be here the entire episode, or if he's here it

164
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,600
will be towards the end, and I'm not making any promises.

165
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Also um...

166
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,840
Which is why we're going to do this episode really quick so that it doesn't happen.

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,440
But we do have the lovely Tiara with us tonight, who is always welcome to be on the show if

168
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,080
she ever gets in town again.

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah, I know.

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,720
I gotta save up some vacation time.

171
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Yeah.

172
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,840
Well, that being said, why don't we hop right into the news head first and get ready for

173
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,160
some decontamination afterwards.

174
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes.

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,040
So the big news this week, of course, Nintendo had their own little press conference not

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,920
to be outdone by Tokyo Game Show, and of course everything Nintendo was covered by.

177
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,560
You're like, bitch, we're Nintendo.

178
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Exactly.

179
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
They can do whatever they want.

180
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,300
We're not coming to your conference, we have our own conference, and you can't come.

181
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,680
So they talked, of course, the 3DS, because that's going to be the big release for them

182
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
next year.

183
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,720
Lots of details coming out about it.

184
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:39,680
Of course, it is going to be coming out in February for a lot of money, unfortunately.

185
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,760
I don't think it's going to exactly be that expensive when it comes out over here, but

186
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,880
over there it is quite expensive.

187
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,200
25,000 yen, which is the equivalent of US, or about 300 US, and it'll be out in aqua

188
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,560
blue and cosmos black.

189
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
So that's interesting.

190
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,240
February 26, 2011 is the actual date.

191
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,200
They're saying that the estimates in the other regions, it's supposed to come out around

192
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,320
before the end of the first quarter, so probably during their fiscal year.

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,480
So that's coming out then, and some other details, of course, came out about it as well,

194
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,980
since they covered everything.

195
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,280
What it'll actually come with when you buy it.

196
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,120
It's going to have, of course, the AC adapter, but what's kind of neat, though, is it has

197
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,720
a charging stand, so you don't have to buy one of those third-party things, just slap

198
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,880
it right in there.

199
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
And by the way, when it's sitting in the charging stand, it kind of looks like a little puppy,

200
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,520
so that's kind of weird with the two cameras on there.

201
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,160
It's a cute little puppy.

202
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,880
Oh, that is cute.

203
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:58,200
Of course, the touch pen and a 2GB SD card, as well as six augmented reality cards, as

204
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,400
well as instruction booklets and all that fun stuff.

205
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,640
And I guess there's actually going to be a built-in augmented reality game that you can

206
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,300
play using the 3DS cameras.

207
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,000
So that'll be kind of neat.

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,400
I wonder if the picked up chat's still in there, because that'd be fun.

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,520
And of course, other fun stuff that's going to be available.

210
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,840
You will be able to, of course, download games to the console as well.

211
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,440
They're going to have the ability to import games that you've downloaded from your DSi

212
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,920
or DSi XL into the 3DS.

213
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,080
Also, they're going to have a brand new virtual console that's going to cover Game Boy and

214
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,640
Game Boy Color games.

215
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,080
So that'll be out there at some point.

216
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:47,580
And other fun things, of course, they're going to be having a web browser that actually works

217
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,580
this time.

218
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,280
It's not just some cheap-ass web browser that they're going to tack on later on.

219
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,320
It's actually going to have Flash support in it, I believe.

220
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,240
And they're going to also have kind of a tag mode as well, where you can walk around and

221
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,360
it'll automatically exchange data with other machines, since you won't have to just manually

222
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,840
turn it on.

223
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,640
And some other things that they're talking about with that is possibly doing firmware

224
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,480
updates using that tag mode.

225
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,200
So kind of a way to make sure everybody's not pirating.

226
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,000
I was reading about that, but it also seems to me, though, that all it would take would

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
be one simple hardware hack.

228
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,040
Well, you could just also turn it off.

229
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
That's really worked well for the PSP.

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Yeah.

231
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,680
Well, they don't have any sort of tag mode with the PSP, but you can always turn that

232
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,800
stuff off.

233
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,200
You might want to turn it off, say, if you're playing at home, because that's going to use

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,640
up a lot of your battery just with the Wi-Fi on all the time.

235
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,960
So that's what's coming out at least for the 3DS stuff, I'm sure.

236
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,960
The big list of games that they were talking about, I mean, everything that you can imagine.

237
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,220
I think they even had video of a bunch of different things.

238
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,400
The new Zelda remakes, Mario Kart looks awesome.

239
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,920
A lot more games we'll be talking about a little bit later, but very exciting stuff.

240
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,260
Well now, you were saying earlier when Bobby called us that you expected it to have a lower

241
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
price point.

242
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah, because it'd be dumb to put it out for $300 over here.

243
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,360
People would buy it though, I think.

244
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,040
I don't think so.

245
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
People paid $700 for a PS3.

246
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,800
People are not going to buy a 3DS for $300 when the Wii is, you know, $200.

247
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
So that's not going to happen.

248
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,600
It'll be $200 is what it's going to be when it comes out over here, I'm guessing.

249
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,840
That'd be my guess, at least.

250
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,920
I mean, it could be very well $250 or something, but I don't think it's going to be $300.

251
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,280
I think $250 would be reasonable.

252
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:04,000
But yeah, we'll just have to wait and see when more information comes out about that

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,080
stuff and once we get closer to the launch.

254
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,640
It'll be here before you know it.

255
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Reckon so.

256
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,440
Well, Tara, do you have any news for us?

257
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes I do, especially if you like blue hedgehogs, because...

258
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
They're crunchy.

259
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Yes.

260
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Wait, what?

261
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Oh.

262
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,720
Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 is coming out this month, and there are going to be a lot

263
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,120
of different release dates for different platforms.

264
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:39,520
It's coming out on October 7th for iPhone and iPod Touch through the iTunes App Store.

265
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,800
You can also get it through the Wii Shop channel on October 11th for 1,500 Wii Points.

266
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:53,400
Xbox Live Arcade, it'll be available October 13th for 1,200 Microsoft Points, or $15.

267
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,640
And on October 12th, you can get it on the PlayStation Network for about 13 euros or

268
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,560
10 pounds, which I believe is something like a million dollars US, or $15.

269
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,360
It's $14.99 actually, but our exchange rate kind of sucks.

270
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,920
That's putting it mildly.

271
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,000
I was actually watching video of Sonic 4 in action, and it looks like it's a lot of fun.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,960
I like the updated look to it, but still the cool 2D style play.

273
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
It looked fun.

274
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,120
I gotta be honest.

275
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I have this.

276
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,200
I played it.

277
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
I didn't like it.

278
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
No?

279
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Really?

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
It was just terrible.

281
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Like some of the different...

282
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,280
They tried to do different things with a few different levels, like they have a mine cart

283
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,280
level where you have to rotate the level around, and it just wasn't very fun.

284
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
But I'm not really one to judge, because I never really cared for the Sonic series too

285
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,800
much.

286
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,200
But for me, it didn't change my mind about it.

287
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,940
So that might be a good thing for people that like Sonic.

288
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,460
It's more of the same, but I thought it was terrible.

289
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,720
So that's my opinion, but this is coming from someone that doesn't really care for Sonic

290
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
the Hedgehog.

291
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Well, one thing.

292
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
Now, I did watch someone play through the mine cart level, and it looks incredibly annoying.

293
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,800
However, I do like the little air dashes in there, where you can target the enemies and

294
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,960
dash at them.

295
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,480
That was my favorite thing in Sonic Adventure.

296
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
So I'm glad that's in there.

297
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,160
I mean, that seems to me like it's enough of an innovation.

298
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,120
I don't know.

299
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,760
We'll see what it is when it comes out, for those of us who don't already have it.

300
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah, I think the appeal of stuff like this is definitely that it's like the old Sonic

301
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
games.

302
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,280
It's still 2D, and the graphics are a bit shinier, but it's got that big nostalgia factor

303
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,840
for people who are like, like I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog as a kid.

304
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,780
So it's like, oh, wow, Sonic, I want to play this just to kind of relive those memories.

305
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,880
That's a lot of it here with me.

306
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,920
I mean, if they don't change what's not broken, right?

307
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Exactly.

308
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Yeah.

309
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,600
Well, in other news, oh, Bungie.

310
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,520
They've done it again.

311
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:08,720
They have banned 15,000 Halo Reach cheaters and are still looking for more to ban.

312
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Not technically cheating.

313
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,560
They just found a glitch in the game and exploited it.

314
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,400
Hey, my story, dude.

315
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,360
Anyway, what they did, it was called network manipulation.

316
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,320
They were going in, they found an exploit in the challenge, in one of the challenge

317
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:36,000
levels where you could complete it 20 and more times and then keep disconnecting yourself.

318
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,920
Or I like, as the Bungie rep said, intentional network manipulation to make it sound like

319
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,840
it was something other than pulling out the cord.

320
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,040
So they were able to find every one of these.

321
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,280
So they've just gone and done a blanket ban.

322
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,280
And what happened with the ban itself is that they've actually banned them for 24 hours

323
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,920
and removed all of the credits that they earned.

324
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,480
And so they won't be able to get any more.

325
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
Tigerclaw in chat points out that it's still cheating if you exploit a glitch, which I

326
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,120
think is true.

327
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I agree.

328
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I agree.

329
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,360
That's just a poor excuse.

330
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,240
If there's a glitch in the game, then you need to patch it and be done with it.

332
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:29,640
If you're using some sort of modified files or modified controllers or something like

333
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
that, then fine.

334
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
That's cheating.

335
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,280
But if you're using the game and using glitches in the game for your benefit, then I don't

336
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
see how that's cheating.

337
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,360
Because you know why?

338
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,320
It's available for everybody to do.

339
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,000
It's not something that you have an advantage over somebody else.

340
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,360
It's just they need to know how to do that.

341
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,040
And if they can do that themselves, then it's just really skill.

342
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,800
In other words, Halo makers, patch your damn game and fix it.

343
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Well, they are.

344
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,080
So it wasn't really anything I don't think that affected a lot of people.

345
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,400
It was just credits to buy crap for your characters.

346
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,480
I don't even see what the big deal is.

347
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,720
It's getting free credits to get free stuff in the end.

348
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,240
But then again, I can see it both ways, especially trying to maintain some level of fairness

349
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,360
in the game and definitely replayability.

350
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,520
The more you play it, the more you have to earn the points the proper way.

351
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,560
But one thing I would like to point out is that Halo Reach earned $200 million in its

352
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,440
first 24 hours.

353
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,840
So that's the biggest Xbox game ever.

354
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
That's pretty amazing.

355
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
They're getting their money out of it.

356
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,640
Just a little bit.

357
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Halo!

358
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,320
It prints money!

359
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,560
So other fun stuff.

360
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,400
Actually, I think you had one more thing.

361
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,720
The cover there.

362
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh yes, Starcraft.

363
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,680
Thank you.

364
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,720
Because Bungie's not the only people buying in that.

365
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,080
Oh, Blizzard's doing it too.

366
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,240
Blizzard hit up 5,000 Starcraft 2 cheaters.

367
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:19,800
They actually, for people who hacked and modded their game, they've been permanently banned.

368
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,000
And I think they're still on the hunt for more people.

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But for right now?

370
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Nope.

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Sorry.

372
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You cheat, you lose.

373
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Bye.

374
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
K, thanks.

375
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Bye.

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Flush.

377
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,920
They're getting serious on it.

378
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Yes.

379
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Literally, only a week away of its release, NBA Elite 11, the reboot, if you will, of

380
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,720
the NBA Live franchise, has been delayed to 2011.

381
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,440
And with it, of course, was the opportunity to get a free copy of NBA Jam, which was only

382
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,840
going to be available originally through the purchase of NBA Elite 11, at least if you

383
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,400
wanted it on PS3 or Xbox 360.

384
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,760
Of course, they haven't announced when they're going to ship it yet, but apparently they're

385
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,440
going to be shipping NBA Jam as a standalone product on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in time

386
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
for the holidays.

387
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,760
And they haven't said exactly when.

388
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,160
I guess it's just a matter of time since the game was pretty much done anyways.

389
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,800
And apparently they're not sure what the cost of it will be.

390
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,480
Unfortunately, NBA Jam was supposed to be a free game, so if they go and charge $60

391
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,400
for it, I think a lot of people are going to feel ripped off.

392
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
But that'll be coming out sometime this year.

393
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,360
Of course, NBA Jam is already available on the Wii, or at least it will be next week.

394
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,960
And it's kind of funny, because that just makes NBA 2K11 the only choice for basketball,

395
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,340
at least in October.

396
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,400
You can go outside and play some real basketball.

397
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,640
That would work too.

398
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
I'm just saying.

399
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,800
No, but then they'll fall and skin their knee!

400
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm actually kind of good at basketball, but I'm very klutzy, so I always am jamming a

401
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,160
finger or getting hit in the face with a basketball or something.

402
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,320
So yeah, the video game versions are very much safer than actual real life sports.

403
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,360
You're not NBA Jamming your finger?

404
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,920
Well, I mean, I dig NBA Jam.

405
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,320
I think that's probably a game I'd be interested in, at least, versus NBA Elite.

406
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,840
But you gotta ask yourself, you know, Elite 11 must have been really fucked up if they

407
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
got to delay it to next year.

408
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,000
I mean, was there some serious problems with that game?

409
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,640
Obviously, no one seems to be really asking them, so why was the game delayed anyways?

410
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,760
Licensed NBA star here wanted more money for said likeness.

411
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,660
There is a rumor, though, that it was done, because there was somebody selling a disc

412
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,680
on eBay for the PlayStation 3 version.

413
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm not sure if that was a demo disc or what.

414
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,080
But at least there was some sort of disc pressed for NBA Elite 11.

415
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I don't know.

416
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,720
It would be interesting to see.

417
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,000
I mean, I don't really know if NBA Live 10 was just that terrible that they had to go

418
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,120
back to the drawing board with Elite, which, by the way, I think Elite is a dumb name for

419
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
their series anyways.

420
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,520
You know, you have this long-running series that people are familiar with, and let's just

421
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,160
get rid of that, because who needs name recognition anyways?

422
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
It's EA.

423
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,520
They're gonna buy anything we put out, right?

424
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,320
So I think it's a little elitist that way, and at least they're taking the time to finish

425
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
it.

426
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Yes.

427
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
No pun there.

428
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,280
For the record, mine was fully intended.

429
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
I don't know.

430
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
But yeah.

431
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Looking forward to NBA Jam.

432
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,320
Hope there's lots of presidents in there.

433
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Hope Clinton's in there.

434
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Of course, Obama.

435
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
That'd be funny.

436
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,760
I think it'd be cool if you could play as Sarah What's-Her-Face.

437
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Sarah Palin?

438
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Yeah.

439
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,320
I'd usually try to put her out of my head, but I'm just picturing now specialized quotes

440
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,920
for different political figures that would be funny, like hers would be, hey, I can see

441
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,360
Russia from up there.

442
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,000
I can see Russia from the court.

443
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,760
But anyways, moving on.

444
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,320
Yes, please.

445
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,600
Since Loki was talking about the 3DS release details, that wasn't all that was talked about

446
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,480
during this whole Nintendo conference.

447
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,840
Mistwalker's last story was actually given a release date, and it's going to be out on

448
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,160
January 27th.

449
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,720
But not only that, there's going to be a couple of Wii sequels that they announced at the

450
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,000
Nintendo conference.

451
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,460
And one is for the Game Boy Advance slash DS, and that's Rhythm Heaven.

452
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,000
And I actually did not like that game.

453
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,080
I played the first Rhythm Heaven, and yeah, I thought it kind of sucked.

454
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
It did.

455
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Yeah.

456
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Yeah.

457
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,120
So I don't know why that's exciting news, but it's there, you know.

458
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:28,160
And the other one is a sequel to the Zero series, which is known here as Fatal Frame.

459
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,280
Ooh, Fatal Frame is awesome.

460
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,100
Yeah, that's kind of a cool game.

461
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,600
That's more exciting than Rhythm Heaven, I think.

462
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,440
The creep factor is definitely with that one.

463
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Yeah.

464
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Are you...

465
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,280
Am I going to pick up Fatal Frame?

466
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
No.

467
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
I want to.

468
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
I think I am.

469
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
They already had a Fatal Frame game over here.

470
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
I just...

471
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I don't really care.

472
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
It was all right.

473
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,400
I still need to buy Choanaki, which has nothing to do with Fatal Frame.

474
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,640
I don't know if you need to buy that.

475
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Okay.

476
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,920
It's probably not that good.

477
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,800
Oh, come on.

478
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,400
It's muscle-bound men flying around shooting things.

479
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
My mistake.

480
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,280
I guess that must be awesome, then.

481
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,320
It is awesome.

482
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,520
It's laughable and awesome.

483
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Indeed.

484
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Yeah.

485
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, now, moving on to another front, PC gaming.

486
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,040
It's been speculated that the PC gaming market is on a serious decline, and yeah, we've seen

487
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
a lot of it.

488
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,640
Some of the major franchises just haven't been there or have been turning towards the

489
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,520
consoles, but now they're saying that certain titles, certain key titles, will be saving

490
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,400
PC gaming altogether, and that's Civilization V and StarCraft II, because, I mean, think

491
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,600
about it.

492
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,320
When those both came out, they were totally pulling in new players, and on top of that,

493
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
we've also gotten...

494
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,220
This isn't just, you know, in the world of the MMO, because, I'm sorry, World of Warcraft

495
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:09,840
is going to be keeping the PC gaming going, but these have just been really big powerhouses.

496
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,000
They've definitely been pulling in the money and getting more people to, you know, upgrade

497
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
computer bits.

498
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Like, we upgraded our graphics card just so that Dan could play StarCraft II, and these

499
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,240
are actually pulling in a lot more of the money.

500
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,840
Now, other titles that are contributing to this, too, is definitely The Sims 3, because

501
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,920
they keep bringing out more and more expansions to that, and I think Steam has the right idea

502
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,540
with bringing out more and more PC games, but as far as those in particular, they are

503
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,760
exclusively PC developed.

504
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,480
They're ones that are definitely trying to keep that whole element of gaming alive, and

505
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,120
do you think that they're going to be enough to keep it going?

506
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,560
I don't even know if PC gaming is really dead.

507
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
I mean, it's just...

508
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,080
Well, it didn't say dead, just on the decline.

509
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,040
I don't even know if that's true.

510
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:09,400
I mean, if anything, I know digital distribution seems to work the best on PC.

511
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I don't think...

512
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,520
I mean, it's definitely easier sometimes on consoles because you don't have to worry about

513
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,960
having the specs to play a game.

514
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,720
It's just, you know, it works or it doesn't.

515
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I don't know.

516
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,160
I don't know if I agree with the statement that it's...

517
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,600
I mean, I'm sure it helped because they're big selling games, but there will always be

518
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,600
something else that comes out that will be a big selling game in the PC world.

519
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:51,960
Well, now, Civ V got a 91 on Metacritic, which is pretty nice, and Starcraft 2, what is

520
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,400
it, 3 million copies have been sold already?

521
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,800
So that's pretty crazy, and it got a 93 on Metacritic.

522
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,920
So I don't know.

523
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,880
I think in some respects, if you look at it in a financial sense, as far as games that

524
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,080
come out that just aren't selling very well, then I think that that's where the decline

525
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
can be seen.

526
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,000
Not necessarily the people that enjoy the gaming themselves, but just in the games that

527
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,800
have come out and how well they sell, but these two have clearly turned that around

528
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
if that was the case.

529
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Yeah.

530
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,800
And then, of course, we've got our MMOs.

531
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Always going to be addicts.

532
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Right, Tara?

533
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Indeed.

534
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:39,680
But for me, there are some MMOs that I can't play because I am on a Mac, so Star Trek Online

535
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:46,600
is completely out for me, and my friend who also owns a Mac has Starcraft 2, and he has

536
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,200
incredible problems with it.

537
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,360
It's just not as stable.

538
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,160
So for me, it's harder to play quote-unquote PC games because I don't own a PC, I own a

539
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Mac.

540
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,200
Well now, Steam, though, does have a Mac client now with a good number of games.

541
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Yeah, that's true.

542
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,360
That is true, and I actually have downloaded a couple of games through Steam.

543
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,360
So actually, that has opened up the door to me to buy more games, but it's just a lot

544
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,140
more difficult, especially if you don't, you know, if you want to go out and you just want

545
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,960
to play a game right away and it's not available, it's like, well, I guess I'll just get the

546
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
console version then.

547
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,400
Well, Ranma's suggesting desktop parallels.

548
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,880
I just, I don't like Windows, and I don't want to put Boot Camp or anything else on

549
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,400
my Mac to run Windows in order to play games.

550
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,640
Yeah, that's about what it's going to be like when I have my full Linux box, except Linux,

551
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,280
one cool thing about Linux, though, is that it will run multiple environments fairly smoothly

552
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,880
if you have the computer with the processing power for it.

553
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,480
So I think that Linux users probably have the best of all those worlds.

554
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,760
I would agree with that.

555
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,520
You know, Linux is a good OS, and it's pretty stable, and it's better than Windows, and

556
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,600
that's all I can say about that.

557
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:20,000
And Linux Mint now is in its final production version, so that's pretty cool, but this isn't

558
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,800
Linux chat.

559
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
It's not?

560
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
No.

561
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Oh, okay.

562
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,480
It's Orishome's foodie-o, where I'm enjoying a delicious taco salad.

563
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,680
Nom nom nom.

564
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,240
So now that we've had our mention of food and Linux, how about some release dates?

565
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,920
I feel sick since we were talking about food and Linux, mainly just about Linux.

566
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,760
I got a sandwich and I thought it would be good, but it's not.

567
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,320
Apparently this local grocery store over here, Rayleigh's, they have these mega subs now,

568
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,480
and they have like input two different meats and stuff on it.

569
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,960
Normally I just get like a turkey and cheese and stuff, but I figured, hey, two different

570
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,000
meats, so I better pick two different meats, two different cheeses, I guess I better pick

571
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
two different cheeses.

572
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,920
I have like a turkey, cheddar, provolone, and salami sandwich, and it's not as good

573
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
as I would have hoped.

574
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,520
The salami's too sweet, I guess.

575
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,080
Anyways, so lots of stuff coming out this week because we are finally in the fourth

576
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,800
quarter and they're kicking it off with lots of games.

577
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
My mic is steady.

578
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,240
Okay, you're cutting out just a little bit.

579
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I don't cut.

580
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,600
Did you give me the crappy mic?

581
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,240
I thought I didn't give you the crappy mic.

582
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Well thank you.

583
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,800
Okay, anyways, so, lots of stuff coming out this week, of course, the delay of FIFA Soccer

584
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,920
2011 on the Wii, it came out a week later than the rest, so poor, poor Wii people had

585
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,640
to wait an additional week.

586
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,120
Pokemon Ranger Guardian Signs on the Nintendo DS, yay, Pokemon!

587
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,720
Pokemans, let us show you them.

588
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Hollywood Squares on the Nintendo Wii, yes.

589
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,160
Because those games never get old.

590
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,980
The Sports Collection from Ubisoft, can we get a more generic name for that, seriously?

591
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,560
That's just some sports games, I guess, on the DS.

592
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,640
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on the Wii and DS?

593
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,240
I hope Regis is still in that.

594
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,720
Enslaved Odyssey to the West coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 this week.

595
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,920
It's supposed to be a pretty awesome action RPG.

596
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,680
Littlest Pet Shop, got lots of games for that.

597
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,000
Littlest Pet Shop, Biggest Star is Blue, Biggest Star is Pink, and Biggest Star is Purple,

598
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,200
and yeah, got to purchase all three, I guess, because they're that awesome.

599
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,760
Wait until you start buying Blue's Clues and all the kid titles for your little boy when

600
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,400
he's older.

601
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,800
Uh, no, for one, the other day I'll make those on DS.

602
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:04,240
It's really just Dora or Go Diego Go, or Ni Ha, Kai Lan, um, no one will not be buying that

603
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
crap.

604
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,320
He will have more sophisticated tastes than that, I mean, come on.

605
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
He's like, you know, I want the Dora the Explorer game.

606
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,820
No, he wants a Mario Kart.

607
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
That's it.

608
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,000
Here you go, you shoot the hooker.

609
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,280
Hey, I can mod a game of Grand Theft Auto that's not as violent.

610
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,520
I have that ability.

611
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:36,920
Ben 10 Ultimate Alien, that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP this week.

612
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,280
Def Jam Rap Star, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, also with the version

613
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
with the microphone.

614
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,880
It is the, I guess, karaoke revolution of the rap world.

615
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,960
And it must be hardcore because it's got Def Jam in front of it.

616
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,480
NBA 2K11, now the only NBA game coming out this year, well, the only simulation NBA game

617
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,980
coming out this year.

618
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,960
That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii.

619
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,440
Ah, yes, more kids games, as you were mentioning before, stuff I could purchase for my son

620
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
later on.

621
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,040
Freddy Fish ABC Under the Sea, that's definitely for little kids.

622
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:27,680
Pets, Fantasies, Sunshine Magic, and Moonlight Magic, those are on DS as well.

623
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,320
Castlevania Lords of Shadow, the Castlevania game that's not really Castlevania, but has

624
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,440
Castlevania entitled Just to Sell More Copies, and that is coming out on PlayStation 3 and

625
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,200
Xbox 360 this week as well.

626
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:49,840
Ah, the epic, award-winning I Love Puppies for Nintendo DS, and it's neither of those

627
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
two.

628
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
It's just another puppy game where you raise puppies and do stuff.

629
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
But don't you love puppies, Logie?

630
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Puppies are great!

631
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,920
Puppies are fine, but I'm not gonna buy another game with puppies in it.

632
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,120
I learned the first time, thank you Nintendo.

633
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,080
Vampire Moon, the Mystery of the Hidden Sun.

634
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,520
It's a vampire adventure game, yay!

635
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,160
It was probably one of those hidden picture games, and I guess that's fine.

636
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,080
Rapala Pro Bass Fishing 2010, the bundles version of that, with your wireless fishing

637
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:26,680
rod, so you can, I don't know, live out your white trash fantasies, I don't know.

638
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,920
Way of the, that's a re-release, if I ever saw one, Way of the Samurai 3, it's already

639
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
been out.

640
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm not gonna even mention that again.

641
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,560
Um, Final Fantasy, the Four Heroes of Light on Nintendo DS, that's actually a pretty good

642
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
release.

643
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Yay!

644
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Yay!

645
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Woo!

646
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,120
I agree with Ranma, he says fuck all these puppy games, I want a kitty game, dammit.

647
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,760
They, okay, listen, they are gonna have kitty games coming out, in fact, I know there's

648
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,040
one coming out, but you're gonna have to live with the puppy game for right now.

649
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,800
How about a monkey game?

650
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
They already had a monkey game, okay.

651
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
There's been a ferret game too.

652
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,480
There's been a pets monkeys game, in fact there was two pets monkeys games, and they

653
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,980
were terrible.

654
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,520
You dressed up monkeys in like little outfits and stuff.

655
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
That's fantastic.

656
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,800
That sounds like the most amazing thing ever.

657
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,340
I only remember what, there was some TV show where there's these people that couldn't have

658
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,360
children or something, they're really old people, and they ended up dressing up monkeys

659
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,240
like children, and would take them out in like baby carriages and stuff like that.

660
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,880
It's very, very disturbing, and you can still get that game, so that, you know.

661
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,480
Alright, Tiara, we need to go get pets monkeys.

662
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,360
Yes, I agree with that statement.

663
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,880
Dress up our monkeys.

664
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Yes.

665
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,520
John Daly's Pro Stroke Golf on Playstation 3, it is-

666
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Pro Stroke.

667
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,920
Pro Stroke, yes.

668
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,240
He's not just an amateur stroke, he can stroke it like a pro.

669
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Oh my.

670
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,440
That is coming out on Playstation 3, it does support the Playstation move for one-to-one

671
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,880
stroking.

672
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,840
And then this was, I think, a leftover from last week because, oops, prank party, still

673
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,400
hasn't come out yet, thank you Hudson for delaying that another week, so I have to mention

674
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,040
it for you, free advertising there.

675
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,080
More Bomberman, Hudson, do you hear me?

676
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
More Bomberman.

677
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,840
There's a new Bomberman game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade at some point.

678
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Bomberman.

679
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
I've seen it.

680
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,240
My own eyes.

681
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,280
Coco Interactive, it's another casual game, Jewel Master Cradle of Athena.

682
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,960
Who gives a crap what it's about, it's just a jewel game that you match three.

683
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,920
NBA Jam coming out on the Wii, that's right, you get it before the Playstation 3 and Xbox

684
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,560
360 versions because it was actually supposed to come out standalone on the Wii.

685
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,360
None of this fancy stuff because your game sucks, so you had to delay it and that kind

686
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
of fun stuff.

687
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:59,480
Um, and that would be it for this week, I know, disappointing, not a lot of pets games.

688
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,880
Yeah, needs more monkeys.

689
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,120
Definitely more monkeys.

690
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:11,040
Sadly there are no monkeys being released in Japan this week either, but there is enslaved

691
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:19,320
Odyssey to the West on both the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, as well as F1 2010 on both

692
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,400
of those consoles, and Red Dead Redemption and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 are both out on the

693
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,460
360 and the PSP as well this week.

694
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:39,520
And on the PS3, but not on the Xbox 360, we have Gekijoban Makros F Itsuarino Utahime

695
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:48,040
Hybrid Pack, yay that's a mouthful, I heard Makros, yes, Makros F to be precise, that's

696
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:56,000
from the new anime Frontier, right, yeah, and Ken Tomahou Togakugen Mono 3 is also coming

697
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,800
out for the Playstation 3, and coming out on the Sony PSP this week we've got Bokuakoku

698
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:11,320
Kenseikan Airport Hero Hameda, so that should be something with an airport in it I assume,

699
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:21,360
Kana Imoto is coming out as well as the limited edition version, and Ken Tomahou Togakugen

700
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,120
Mono 3 is also coming out on the PSP.

701
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:33,920
And lastly for Japanese releases on the Nintendo DS, we've got Kingdom Hearts Recoded, yeah

702
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:43,160
that's fun, I love Kingdom Hearts, yay, we also have 10 Kaichi Sengoku Lovers, and Maru

703
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:54,440
Gogaku Shikaku Dashu Hanbashi Kente Shiken 2Q 3Q, that's too many QQ's, that's two or

704
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:01,760
three too many Q's, two Q's is sad, three Q's is grateful, sound cute, anyway, that

705
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:11,000
was awful, how about we go jump overboard and swim our way over to the UK, actually

706
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,600
I would just rather just be teleported there and stay, that would be great, on the 5th

707
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,760
we have Left 4 Dead The Sacrifice for PC and Xbox 360, and on the 5th we also have Fantasy

708
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,640
Star Portable 2, on the 8th is a whole crap ton of stuff, Castlevania Lords of Shadow,

709
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,480
Enslaved Odyssey to the West, Final Fantasy, The Four Heroes of Light, Front Mission Evolved,

710
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:42,200
John Daly's Pro Stroke Off, cause he likes to stroke it, like a pro in England, oh dear,

711
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:52,800
PES 2011, We Party, and WRC on a bunch of systems, and that would be it for the UK.

712
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,560
Alrighty, well one game that's not coming out this week, or even when it was intentionally

713
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:07,640
gonna come out back in April of 2011, Gears of War 3 has been delayed to the 4th quarter,

714
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,320
no reason why, I'm sure it's just to add extra polish, or because Microsoft realized hey,

715
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,820
we don't have a good 4th quarter game, so it will not be coming out when it's intended,

716
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,040
but you know what, there's plenty of games coming out in April, and hell, I wouldn't

717
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:33,720
want to take any more time away from Marvel vs. Capcom 3, so I'm fine with that delay.

718
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,160
I definitely, I think I could just totally ignore any Gears of War for Marvel vs. Capcom

719
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,680
3, because that game is full of the awesome and tons of characters I want to play.

720
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,800
Yeah, MVC 3, yes, Gears of War 3, probably not, because I haven't played Gears of War

721
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,920
1 or 2, just saying.

722
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,200
I don't know, I think I'm most excited for playing as X-23 in Deadpool.

723
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,280
I don't know about Deadpool, but yeah, Deadpool in video games is kind of cool because he's

724
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,760
aware that he's a video game character, and he has all the funny lines, but there's too

725
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
much Deadpool.

726
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,480
Deadpool is self-aware now.

727
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Yes.

728
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Well really, don't get us started on Deadpool, because we always have the weekly Deadpool

729
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,440
rant on comic insanity, plug plug plug.

730
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,720
But a game that is coming out that is not being delayed, well, it's not being delayed

731
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,600
because it came out in 2003, and I remember playing this game on the PS2, is Beyond Good

732
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
and Evil.

733
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
Do you guys remember that game?

734
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Yes.

735
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Yeah.

736
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,740
That was a good game, and it's actually getting an HD re-release.

737
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:54,560
So Ubisoft is going to be re-releasing the game in high definition, and they haven't

738
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,120
said when, but sometime in 2011.

739
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,440
That sounds like it will be a treat.

740
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
Yes indeed.

741
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm very excited about that.

742
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,680
I really loved that game.

743
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,160
It was a good game.

744
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:16,560
Well now it's time for the classic game of the week, and because I do this, it's kind

745
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,560
of weird for me to have to manipulate the music and everything at the same time, so

746
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,840
I'm actually just going to stop that, because I don't have Rob's mad skills to do them all

747
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,440
at the same time.

748
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,680
And I will instead start off with a little bit of music, and I'd like to see how many

749
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,040
people can guess what it is.

750
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,040
Just by the opening.

751
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,040
Very beginning.

752
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,040
Presented by Sega.

753
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
That should be clue enough.

754
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,080
Hey, we are the Sonic Team.

755
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Yes, the game of the week is Samba de...

756
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
Samba de amigo!

757
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,080
Samba de nidé!

758
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Woohoo!

759
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
Party!

760
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,560
I have a special love of Samba de amigo.

761
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Uno, due, dre, cuatro.

762
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,160
God, the music is just so perky.

763
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,960
I feel like shaking my butt, or some maracas, or maybe the microphone like a maraca.

764
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,280
Or all three of those.

765
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,680
I will do them all at the same time, which makes it really bad for radio.

766
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,040
At any rate, as we've been talking about maracas, yes you use maracas as your controllers, and

767
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,560
they have these little sensors on the bottom.

768
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,000
And what you do is, you have to hit these little, there's two in the middle that are

769
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
on the top, and two in the middle that are on the bottom, and then two out to the side.

770
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,480
Well, one on each side.

771
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,200
And you have to hit the right little sphere with your maraca at the same time, and it

772
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,520
uses the motion sensor to make sure you're in the right place.

773
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,360
You have to actually adjust it by your height so that you can make sure that you're going

774
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,880
to hit the sensor at the right place.

775
00:47:51,880 --> 00:48:00,720
And this game was played at many a New Year's party at my house, I can say.

776
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:08,360
The game uses lots of different Latin-styled music, and you are, on screen you are represented

777
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,640
by a monkey named Amigo.

778
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,000
We're back to monkeys, Takara.

779
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,600
Yay, monkey!

780
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,960
And he will dance, and the better you do, he'll do the ice-crunchy Cartman face and

781
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,160
start dancing even more, and then the sky will turn all rainbows, and so you either

782
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:36,360
shake high, or you shake middle, or you shake low, and when you hit the blue areas, you're

783
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,380
just going to hit it once and shake, but you have red ones that tell you just to shake

784
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,320
it over and over and over and over and over again.

785
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:49,360
And then the stickly man comes up on the screen, which we all know stickly man from his next

786
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:56,920
job working for Homestar Runner, but he poses, and you have to match that pose by holding

787
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,320
each maraca at the right position, as indicated on the screen.

788
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,360
So you can pick three songs and play through each of them.

789
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,440
You can play them easier or harder.

790
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,240
You also have little mini-games, one called Guacamole, which is actually pronounced Guacamole,

791
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,340
like Whack-a-mole, and Strike a Pose, where you have to do different series of poses,

792
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,800
and one, two, samba, where you have to hit different spots in sequence.

793
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:29,760
In the Japanese version, it's called ichinii samba, which is a funny pun in Japanese, because

794
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,040
it's one, two, three, but samba, yeah, anyway.

795
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,440
There's party mode and battle, where you can play versus couples game.

796
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,440
There's a couples game version, which in Japan is called Love Love, where you play through

797
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,520
the song to see how compatible you are.

798
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:53,240
And then in later versions, in version 2000, there's different things to play in there,

799
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:59,720
like hustle mode, where you have to follow the dots and shake the maracas the right way,

800
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,440
but you have to do things in these really weird poses, and you're actually moving the

801
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,920
full 360 rotation around, so it's kind of interesting.

802
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,440
There's also different versions out that have extra songs in there.

803
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:21,520
In version 2000, there's another monkey out called Amiga, who plays a tambourine, and

804
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,980
she's very fun.

805
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:35,200
In the other versions that came out, there actually are other songs that were in different

806
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,480
Sega games, like for downloadables, you had the theme from After Burners, you had Burning

807
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,680
Hearts from Burning Rangers, which I love.

808
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,560
You also have the Rent-A-Hero theme, which is incredibly funny, stuff from Nights, stuff

809
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,800
from Sonic Adventure, Jet Set Radio, Daytona USA, Outrun, Fantasy Zone, the Oppa Oppa theme

810
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,640
is in there, Sonic CD, the Japanese opening song is in there, Super Sonic Racing from

811
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,140
Sonic R, and just a bunch of cool stuff, but as far as the songs in the game, definitely

812
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:14,000
some people might recognize Mambo No. 5 and Mexican Flyer, well anyone who played Space

813
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,720
Channel 5 and watched Swing Girls should know that song anyway, Oya Como Va by Santana,

814
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,840
Papa Loves Mambo is in there, also SOS The Tiger Took My Family by Dr. Bombay is in there,

815
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,160
which has nothing to do with Latin music.

816
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,120
And yet is still awesome.

817
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,280
Yes.

818
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:41,720
And one of my favorite things to play in there was actually the Cup of Life is in there,

819
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,920
I thought it was funny, and the Stupid Catch-Up Song is in there, which I always avoided,

820
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,880
and Highway to Hell is in there.

821
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,760
In the Wii version anyway.

822
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
So yeah.

823
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,840
That has a lot to do with Latin music.

824
00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:01,800
I'm going to play the combination of Highway to Hell and Tub Thumping, which is also in

825
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,400
all of the versions.

826
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,960
It's really fun, actually the Wii version did come out, but it didn't get very, very

827
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,780
good ratings.

828
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,460
It has some extra stuff in there, it has Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet, and Mambo Mambo,

829
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:26,920
and I Want Candy, and it's got other characters in there, such as Sonic and Ooh La La.

830
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:33,320
And you can, it will use your little me's, and put some right by your score.

831
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,200
And it changes the different expressions that are used based on your performance in the

832
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,000
game.

833
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,440
There was a successor out that not many people know about, I've actually played it, that's

834
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:54,000
called Shakuto Tambourine, which is played just like Samba de Amigo, except you use a

835
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,320
tambourine controller and it's all J-Pop music.

836
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:03,640
And there was a version of Samba de Amigo, kinda, that was the itoy version for Sega

837
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:10,060
Superstars, where it used the itoy to hold where your hands were, instead of the sensors

838
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,600
like the maracas used.

839
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,240
And by the way, Shakuto Tambourine is actually really fun and very hard, just saying.

840
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,240
Very hard.

841
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,720
Because you've only got one tambourine, and you have to do these little swiping moves

842
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,360
over your head and shake the tambourine at the same time, and it's kind of a pain in

843
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,360
the butt.

844
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,520
Anyway, you've got characters, you have Amigo, who we've mentioned is a monkey, and Amigo,

845
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,460
who is also a monkey, woohoo!

846
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,960
And we have Linda, who is the Samba school dancer that wears the butterfly costume.

847
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,080
And Bingo and Bongo, they're bears that play the bongos.

848
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,440
Rio is a cat person who's like a cat and a jaguar.

849
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,480
He carries a rose and a horn, ooh.

850
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,720
There's Chumba and Wamba, who play the mandolin and the conga drums, and they're named after

851
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
Chumbawamba.

852
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,800
And Mr. Pose, who is also known as Stickley Man.

853
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:08,080
And that is the game, that is Samba de Amigo, which I personally think the Dreamcast ones

854
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,240
are the best, but that would be me.

855
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,880
So anybody else enjoy Samba de Amigo?

856
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,200
Samba de Amigo is awesome, but like all the animals, the way that you describe the characters

857
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:29,560
just now, it makes me think of like old Disney cartoons like DuckTales and Tailspin, where

858
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,560
it's like a town full of weird animals doing stuff that people usually do.

859
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:41,320
It sounds like Samba de Amigo belongs in like, you know, the Disney kind of world.

860
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,040
Yeah, I guess so.

861
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:54,320
Maybe they've got their own like Amigoville, where they all hang out and drink Nescafe.

862
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,480
I used to play Samba de Amigo a lot, like a million years ago.

863
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,800
It was a long time ago.

864
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,800
It was a good game though.

865
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,800
It was fun.

866
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,800
Oh, it's fantastic.

867
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,640
Some of my old New Year's parties that we used to have over here were always, I mean

868
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,240
rock bands pretty much replaced just about everything music related, but would always

869
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:17,080
break out DDR and Samba de Amigo and pretty soon just be drunk in Samba de Amigo, surrounded

870
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:23,520
by lots of beer and people would fall over and I would tell them not to break my maracas.

871
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,160
I still have my maracas and I still, I should dust them off and play them soon.

872
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,040
You should.

873
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,560
Well, we are now though, sadly at the end of part A, but this means we get to go into

874
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,000
part B. Yay.

875
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,600
So everyone stay tuned.

876
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,240
We're going to go to a little break and we will hear you when we, we will hear you.

877
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,280
We will talk to you when we get back.

878
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,960
You will hear us when we get back.

879
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
I can't hear them.

880
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Ah, no.

881
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,960
Okay.

882
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:08,880
Welcome back to part B of episode four, three hundred and eight, the three eighty four.

883
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Three eighty four.

884
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,880
Yes.

885
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,880
Episode yes.

886
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,880
Of Orange Lounge Radio.

887
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,480
I am the Dark Sakura.

888
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,200
This is Loki and joining us is Mar and Marvel, also known as or known in real life as Tiara.

889
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Woo hoo.

890
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,720
I just told them your secret identity.

891
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,720
Oh no.

892
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,920
So it's like you unmasked me in front of millions and millions of people.

893
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,160
Now I'm going to have to make a deal with the devil and have my entire history changed

894
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,320
so that nobody knows who I am.

895
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,600
Except really the Illuminati is behind it.

896
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Yep.

897
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Yeah.

898
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:50,840
So welcome back, but that's another reference to perhaps a different podcast that Tiara

899
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,840
and I do.

900
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Hmm.

901
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
Perhaps.

902
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,880
A different friend of ours who is also an Orange Lounge listener.

903
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,200
So welcome back to the show.

904
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:06,560
As I said, we have got some rapid fire news coming up and tweeter topics because they're

905
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,960
tweety and good.

906
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,640
And if you're all good, then Tiara might do it in a porn voice.

907
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,640
Perhaps.

908
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
Perhaps.

909
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Perhaps.

910
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,640
Mayhaps?

911
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,640
Mayhaps.

912
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
Mayhaps.

913
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,640
We may have porn voice tonight.

914
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,640
Hahaha.

915
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,640
Okay.

916
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,640
So why don't you get us started, Loki?

917
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,960
Finally, we've been begging and pleading for Capcom to listen, and they have Mega Man Legends

918
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,200
3 has been announced.

919
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:40,100
Coming to the 3DS, of course, right now it's just Project, or Mega Man Legends 3 Project.

920
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:45,760
It's a work in progress, I guess, and we'll be coming out at some point, I'm guessing

921
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,760
probably next year.

922
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,120
So that'll be kind of cool.

923
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,200
And of course, this week, like every other week, Rock Band Download content.

924
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,200
Got lots of it.

925
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,760
This week we've got REM.

926
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,280
They have a pack there, including Driver 8.

927
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,720
It's the end of the world as we know it.

928
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,760
Living Well is the best revenge.

929
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:14,200
Radio Free Europe, Stand, Superman These Days, and What's the Frequency, Kenneth.

930
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,780
Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in fake points.

931
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,040
Or you can get the pack for $13.49 or 1080 Microsoft Points.

932
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:29,220
Sorry, it's not available for a pack on the WiiWare store.

933
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:33,120
Also the T-Rex pack, featuring 3 songs from them.

934
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,960
Children of the Revolution, Cosmic Dancer, and Jeepster.

935
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,320
Also those available for $2 each or $5.49 for the whole pack.

936
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,680
So that'll be coming this week.

937
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,960
And unfortunately no standalone songs.

938
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,320
I guess it's just those two packs.

939
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,880
You can purchase a song standalone in there, but nothing additional.

940
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:01,840
And then finally, there's been some new information coming out about my game of the year next

941
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
year.

942
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,320
Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

943
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,320
Some gameplay video.

944
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,600
Looked absolutely awesome.

945
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:15,280
Of course, they had some details regarding the gameplay in case anyone had concerns.

946
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,640
First off, there's actually some new armors that you can use in the game.

947
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,400
They have 4 different ones that you can kind of swap around through.

948
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,440
You will still be limited to 2 weapons per mission, which kind of sucks because I really

949
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,440
wish it was 3.

950
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
But whatever.

951
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,440
I'll deal.

952
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:37,280
And 150 weapons, also I believe you can earn different points to increase abilities on

953
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,720
your player as well as the weapons that you have.

954
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,160
There will also be an equivalent to the genocide gun in the game, which for those who haven't

955
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,640
played Earth Defense Force 2017, the genocide gun is a gun that fires a really big laser

956
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,520
blast that blows up a lot of stuff.

957
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,160
The title itself will also run very smoothly as opposed to the last game that came out,

958
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,920
where you can actually have up to 80 enemies on the screen and the game will actually keep

959
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,400
running smoothly at 30 frames per second.

960
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:09,600
The game will also feature some increased difficulties as well, the legendary infernal

961
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
mode.

962
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,000
It's going to take about 8 hours to complete the game on normal mode, but normal is for

963
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,760
wimps, so no one should actually play it on normal.

964
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,400
And they're also going to have a 6 player horde mode, which apparently you will be pitted

965
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,960
against endless waves of enemies that will attack you relentlessly.

966
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,840
Also a remix mode where random enemies will spawn instead of the normal enemies that appear

967
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,520
during the campaign.

968
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,440
And if you're very interested in checking it out, there's some gameplay video on Destructoid

969
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,720
and oh my god it looks awesome.

970
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:46,520
I was kind of worried though with the developer being the one that did the Matt Hazard game

971
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,920
and that wasn't that great, but it looks cool and the dialogue is extremely cheesy, so it

972
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,320
should be cool.

973
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:59,920
One other thing, the game will actually have 3 player co-op drop in drop out.

974
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,380
They're also going to have 2 AI controlled bots that will fight alongside of you in case

975
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,560
you don't have actual friends to play with.

976
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,680
And apparently they are pretty good and they'll actually help you out through the game, otherwise

977
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,920
you can get people to help you out.

978
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,400
And definitely looking forward to this, going to probably pick up about 3 copies of it,

979
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:26,840
so make sure I have one for each person to play at my work, so yeah, check it out.

980
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,440
And we got any more news, Tiara?

981
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,240
Yes we do.

982
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,440
Those of you who have pre-ordered your keyboard bundle for Rock Band 3 on the PS3 may have

983
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:45,680
noticed that it has disappeared from US retail sites and that's because there is a contract

984
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,600
problem where Harmonix cannot sell the PS3 keyboard bundle.

985
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,760
So you will have to buy your keyboard for $10 extra, but you can still buy the bundle

986
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:04,080
on the Xbox 360 and Wii, so that's good, yay, because I have the Xbox 360.

987
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:12,240
And also, Konami is releasing an awesome, awesome, awesome new 3D racing arcade game

988
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:18,220
called Road Fighters, and it's got like a cabinet with a steering wheel, and it has

989
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:22,560
drop down 3D glasses, so that's kind of awesome.

990
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,640
And you can switch between 2D and 3D by pushing a button, and I don't know, it seems cool,

991
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,220
I love arcade games like this, I suck at racing games, but it just looks cool, and 3D is the

992
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:40,840
whole new fad of TV, movies, and gaming, so it should be interesting, and it does look

993
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,240
really cool.

994
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:49,960
The glasses look ridiculous, I have to say, but it should be fun, and 3D really I think

995
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:55,240
is an excellent element for a racing game, since you are right in there with all the

996
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,080
cars and all the excitement.

997
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,120
The glasses look 80s-tastic.

998
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:03,600
They do, they really do, I think that's part of the reason it's so awesome.

999
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,960
That's great.

1000
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:12,560
And lastly, with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 coming out, and Street Fighter 4 released lately,

1001
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,120
and things like that, what about Darkstalkers?

1002
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,880
I would like to see another game having something to do with Darkstalkers, wouldn't you?

1003
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,880
Absolutely.

1004
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:29,040
Well, Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono told Eurogamer that making another game in the series would

1005
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:35,400
be his ultimate dream, and it can only happen if fans demand it.

1006
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:42,880
And he said that it's all up to the readers to get Inafune-san interested in doing the

1007
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:49,040
game, and according to Ono, it would take 1 million requests before Inafune says yes.

1008
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,160
So unfortunately there haven't been that many requests for the game.

1009
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:00,860
There have been about 5,000, so only 995,000 more requests for a Darkstalkers game before

1010
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,360
they will consider making one.

1011
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,360
Get on it, peeps.

1012
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,920
I'm not gonna put my name in there.

1013
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:12,800
It's dumb, I mean come on, they're doing this crap that they did with, like, what, uh, paranormal

1014
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,800
activity.

1015
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,080
They're doing the same shit with the second movie too, by the way, where, demand it in

1016
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,080
your city.

1017
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,080
No, how about I don't?

1018
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Because the first movie was terrible.

1019
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,080
Yeah, as I said-

1020
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,080
I demand that you don't put it in my city.

1021
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:28,040
More like Paris Normal activity, I thought it was the worst movie ever, but I digress.

1022
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,640
This is Darkstalkers, and Darkstalkers is awesome.

1023
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:36,080
Yeah, but I think that they should know that the interest is out there, and if they made

1024
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,880
the game, that people would buy it, and you know, for them to be like, oh no, you have

1025
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,480
to ask us for it.

1026
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,960
Well just make the freaking game, it's not like you're gonna be losing money on it.

1027
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,520
Well ask for it with our dollars.

1028
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,520
Yes.

1029
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,520
Or our yen.

1030
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
Or whatever.

1031
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,280
If you say it bluntly, it's like saying, okay, listen, you gotta suck my cock, but you're

1032
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,600
gonna have to beg for it first, I mean, that's, that's the way they're putting it, I mean,

1033
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,400
it's just, it's insulting.

1034
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,040
I mean, if you wanna put out a game, put out a good fighting game, because people are gonna

1035
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,500
buy any fighting game that you put out.

1036
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,000
Don't make people beg for it.

1037
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,900
We own the recipe for these fantastic lollipops, but a million of you must say that you want

1038
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,440
our lollipops.

1039
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,360
And by lollipops, we mean cock, so.

1040
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:26,760
I was trying to do something that every, who does not like a good lollipop, I mean, please.

1041
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,680
Well, how about the other things that are definitely gonna be coming out.

1042
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,960
Square Enix is actually making adjustments to bring out Parasite Eve on PSN, and I don't

1043
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,320
know about you guys, but Parasite Eve was pretty fun, although I do have to say there

1044
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:45,600
were other games that I thought were more fun, but Parasite Eve was pretty cool.

1045
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,880
Not bad for a game based off of a book.

1046
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,720
So they're basically just gonna be bringing it out, they just have to tweak it, so that

1047
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,720
it'll be playable.

1048
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,440
And it's not just Parasite Eve, it's Parasite Eve 2 on the PSN.

1049
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,720
Did you ever see the live action movie?

1050
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,440
I have it somewhere, I haven't watched it.

1051
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,640
I've been trying to look for the translated version of the book.

1052
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,400
I think I have it on VCD somewhere.

1053
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,480
I've got a VCD of it, yeah, that's, my copy's on a VCD as well.

1054
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,400
I just sorta, oh, that's cool, and then, oh, look what else we've got, Final Fuck X.

1055
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,580
Cause I think I got them both at the same time.

1056
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,040
That was also based off a book.

1057
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Not really.

1058
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
Okay.

1059
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,360
And, moving forward, how about Scott Pilgrim?

1060
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:35,000
The new download content is going to have, for Scott Pilgr- I said Spock Pilgrim.

1061
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Spock Pilgrim.

1062
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,400
I would buy Spock Pilgrim, cause it is Spocktober, you know.

1063
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,400
Yes it is.

1064
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,980
For Scott Pilgrim vs. the World the Game, there is going to be new download content

1065
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,460
to go along with the film's release on DVD and Blu-ray.

1066
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,720
It will have a new playable character, Knives Chow, along with two other modes.

1067
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,520
That's an arena battle with weapons, kind of a light version of Super Smash Brothers

1068
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,520
it's described as, and dodgeball.

1069
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:09,880
And it will be $1.99 on Playstation Network or 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.

1070
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,980
And they also are going to fix some of the difficulty balancing to make it, the average

1071
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:23,360
Joe level, more forgiving, and get rid of some bugs, and do drop in, drop out co-op.

1072
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,640
It's only though for offline play only.

1073
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:35,160
And they're not going to incorporate the online MMO into it, so none of that yet.

1074
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:42,020
And then, speaking of Spock, Star Trek Infinite Space is to be coming out.

1075
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:51,160
It's a free-to-play browser version of the game, so Mac people can play it.

1076
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,400
And it will be out in the summer of 2011.

1077
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:00,320
It's going to be published by Gameforge and developed by Keen, who also did What's Cooking

1078
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,960
with Jamie Oliver.

1079
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,760
And now this is the part that makes me happy.

1080
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,280
It's set during Deep Space Nine.

1081
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
That's cool.

1082
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,880
I thought you were going to say Jamie Oliver is in the game, so that's exciting.

1083
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,880
No.

1084
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,680
That's not special.

1085
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:20,560
The only cooking I want is the Klingon chef who plays the violin.

1086
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,880
Yes.

1087
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,520
And sings opera.

1088
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,440
Klingon opera is the best.

1089
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,520
Yes it is.

1090
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,920
And serves half-dead gah.

1091
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,880
And of course, you should hopefully be able to read Shakespeare and its original Klingon

1092
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,880
in this game.

1093
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,200
Because it sounds the best in its original Klingon.

1094
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,200
Yes.

1095
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:48,840
But the director, Anthony Christolakis, I guess, Greek name, we consider ourselves very

1096
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,020
lucky to have this opportunity and we are highly committed to delivering a Star Trek

1097
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,240
experience fans can be proud of.

1098
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,600
Yay!

1099
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:04,160
And well, it's not STO, but I like that it's set in the Deep Space Nine universe.

1100
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,160
That makes me particularly happy, because Deep Space Nine was my favorite.

1101
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:14,360
Well, it's, you know, TNG was going on at the same time as Deep Space Nine, so it's

1102
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:20,000
probably going to be more focused towards the war, I'm guessing, with the Jem'Hadar.

1103
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,720
So that'll be pretty awesome, because that was really a great arc, a great story in the

1104
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,880
Star Trek universe.

1105
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,280
I agree, and it certainly opened up lots of fantastic characterization for all kinds of

1106
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,540
people in the series, so I thought it was fantastic.

1107
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:40,920
So moving forward, we've had another visitor come into the room who is not supposed to

1108
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,920
be in the room.

1109
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,920
You need to go find your mommy.

1110
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,920
Please shut the door.

1111
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,120
Thank you, Punkin.

1112
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
Sorry.

1113
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,680
She didn't shut the door.

1114
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,680
She didn't shut the door.

1115
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,680
Off with her head!

1116
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,420
Oh, that was Sophie.

1117
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,120
That is my cousin-in-law's daughter.

1118
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,120
Ah.

1119
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,280
Yes, we have lots of children over right now.

1120
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,800
She was excited about Star Trek, can you blame her?

1121
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah.

1122
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,040
She came in wearing my Indiana Jones hat when we were talking about Star Trek, so where

1123
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,040
were we?

1124
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,720
Oh yes, we were over to, um, Twitter Topics, weren't we?

1125
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,680
What do we use for Twitter Topics again?

1126
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,680
Journey to Wonderland?

1127
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,680
Oh.

1128
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,680
Um.

1129
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,680
Well, we're using it.

1130
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,200
It's Twitter Topic time.

1131
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:38,000
I don't have any Twitter Topics, so we forgot to tell them to send Twitter Topics.

1132
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I did not forget.

1133
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I told them to do the break.

1134
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,760
Yeah, we told them in the chat room to send the Twitter Topics, so we do have some Twitter

1135
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,760
Topics.

1136
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,240
And, uh, let's see.

1137
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:56,880
Tigerclaw305 sent us a story about ex-Nintendo sales chief to lead Kidzania's creation of

1138
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,120
kid-sized cities.

1139
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,760
So let's see what this is about.

1140
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,640
I found the right music.

1141
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,200
Ah, that sounds more like it.

1142
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,200
Now you can continue.

1143
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:15,520
Kidzania is creating places for kids to learn about real life jobs and entertain themselves

1144
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,620
in many cities with shopping malls.

1145
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:23,840
So I don't know, it sounds kind of like some kind of Second Life type thing.

1146
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,600
I don't know.

1147
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,640
Second Life equals no life.

1148
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,200
Yeah.

1149
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:38,640
And Tigerclaw305 also sent that the Just Cause film has been optioned, and the movie script

1150
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:47,200
will be written by Michael Ross, and it will be produced by Adrian Ascaria, and that should

1151
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,200
be kind of cool or probably crappy because video game movies kind of suck.

1152
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,000
When asked why they decided to make the movie, they said Just Cause.

1153
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,600
Well sure, why not?

1154
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,960
We're gonna make it.

1155
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,240
That's the reason, yes.

1156
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:08,080
And for the record, Shadowrunner says Fallout Children.

1157
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:14,000
Let's see, Jay Jugo says, hey guys, I'd like this new way to present a co-host on the show.

1158
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,060
This is a must keep, in caps.

1159
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,520
Never forget, in hashtag.

1160
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Never forget.

1161
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,520
Never.

1162
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:29,600
Okay, and Spazinator says, in my porn voice, hey, there's a crap ton of new free vids on

1163
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,680
the PSN store right now.

1164
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:37,400
I assume that they're also available on XBL too, so what do you think about that?

1165
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,400
That sounds hot.

1166
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,240
Tigerclaw sent us another story, but we already talked about it, Blizzard banning Starcraft

1167
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,840
2 cheaters.

1168
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,840
And DarkKisuke says, wait, what?

1169
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,620
Sexual innuendos in Orange Lounge?

1170
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,620
No way.

1171
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,920
Yes way, of course way, duh.

1172
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,920
Lollipops.

1173
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,480
Way way.

1174
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:09,740
And Matt Ostrovsky, sorry if I said that wrong, Matt, sent us a story that says, story sounds

1175
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:10,740
too good.

1176
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:11,740
It might be a scroll.

1177
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,080
Oh no.

1178
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,880
Yuji Naka wants to work on the Dreamcast 2.

1179
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,880
No.

1180
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,880
Oh yeah.

1181
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
We can dream.

1182
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,880
We can dream.

1183
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,880
That is wrong.

1184
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,880
We can dream.

1185
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,880
That's never gonna happen.

1186
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,880
We can dream about the Dreamcast.

1187
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,880
Waa waa.

1188
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,880
Poor Dreamcast.

1189
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,880
Not gonna happen.

1190
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,400
I think one more person sent a Twitter topic.

1191
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:43,000
Yes, AlphaKananagram sent us a topic about the Katamari Damacy director and his wife

1192
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,280
starting a new company called Uvula with a low-key website.

1193
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,440
And then rather than focusing solely on game development, the company's About Us page details

1194
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,720
a focus on music and video games, adding that we want to widen our limit.

1195
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,720
Okay.

1196
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,520
Widen the limit.

1197
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,320
So what could they do to top Noby Noby Boy?

1198
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,320
Hmm.

1199
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:12,360
But you know, I actually still play Noby Noby Boy on my iPhone.

1200
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,160
I'm not surprised by this, actually.

1201
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:18,720
He's going to eventually meet girl.

1202
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,960
It's just like, I have no brain capacity to think of anything to do, so I'm going to play

1203
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,040
with my little worm person.

1204
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,040
It works.

1205
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,160
DDR dollar bill says no Dreamcast 2 ever.

1206
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,160
Alas.

1207
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,160
Sadness.

1208
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:41,360
Without the extra S. Shenmue 3 on Dreamcast 2, fall of 20, never ever.

1209
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,360
Aw.

1210
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,360
Sadness.

1211
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:49,720
But yeah, that will do it for our Twitter topics this week, and if you want to have

1212
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,320
your Twitter topics read by Rob when he is back next week, then send your Twitter topics

1213
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,320
to Rob at at O-L-R on Twitter and he will read them, I'm sure.

1214
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:05,720
Maybe we can get Rob, instead of doing a porn voice, he can invite Mr. Spanky.

1215
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:11,440
Rob can do one of his voices, which always sound like Rob with kind of a high-pitched

1216
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,440
voice.

1217
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:19,840
So how about we find a few more topics to discuss?

1218
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,560
I suppose we could.

1219
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:28,240
And it's kind of interesting, apparently, of course, it's not unexpected, Sony is going

1220
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,440
after anything that's possibly going to mod the PlayStation 3.

1221
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:38,800
Of course, they went after the PS Jailbreak before, and now that that's kind of gone,

1222
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,040
because there's free versions out there, they're now going after other things, including the

1223
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:54,960
PS Groove, the kind of open source device out there, PS Freedom, and Open PS Jailbreak.

1224
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:06,160
They are aiming for takedowns, I guess, apparently the website PSX Scene has found some different

1225
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:13,480
things that they've marked exhibits, and they are trying to basically erase the existence

1226
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:19,240
of these, not necessarily the devices, but of these programs, because the devices themselves

1227
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:28,080
can be practically anything nowadays, because they've been adopting the PS Groove to practically

1228
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,080
everything.

1229
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:40,720
Everything from an iPod to a TI-84 to some old-ass MP3 players, USB development, cards,

1230
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,720
just everything.

1231
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:46,400
Unfortunately, not PSP, because they were unable to port it over to the PSP, but your

1232
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:56,040
phone, iPhone, Droid, you name it, it can hack the PS3 now.

1233
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,240
Your mom can hack a PS3.

1234
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,640
They're going to start hack storing brains, because people are always going to think of

1235
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,640
a way to do it.

1236
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,080
Yeah, I mean, you can try to stop people from doing that stuff, but where there's a will,

1237
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:11,520
there's a way, and if they want to hack it, they will.

1238
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,520
Exactly.

1239
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:21,960
Speaking of hack storing brains, during the Tokyo Game Show event, Q Entertainment head

1240
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:31,040
Tetsuya Mizuguchi unveiled the new component of his upcoming rail shooter, Child of Eden,

1241
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:39,040
and he wants participation from us, and it's for a part of the game he calls the Journey

1242
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:45,160
Project, and he's seeking to build a collection of player-submitted pictures for inclusion

1243
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,480
on the last level of the Child of Eden game.

1244
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,740
Mizuguchi says, in this game, the player's mission is to purify everything, even data,

1245
01:17:54,740 --> 01:18:00,260
and this is the final stage of the game, you know, I need the beauty of memories.

1246
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:05,600
So with collected memories of family, friends, and beautiful landscapes, you can get that

1247
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,040
kind of memory with music.

1248
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,760
It must be real.

1249
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:15,400
Mizuguchi also added, I want to put everybody's credit at the end of the game, yeah.

1250
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,280
Ubisoft clarified that images can be submitted to the official Child of Eden website through

1251
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,440
November 20th, and any approved photos will be used in the game.

1252
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:32,340
I can't even imagine what's going to be submitted by random people.

1253
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,840
No buts in the game.

1254
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:41,400
We're going to get a lot of gongoro, which would be kind of funny.

1255
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:46,400
What the hell's going on out there?

1256
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,440
Like I said, the cousins are over and they're having a fun time in the front room watching

1257
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:58,760
YouTube videos of the guy singing all of the John Williams themes with his own lyrics.

1258
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,600
Actually all about Star Wars.

1259
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Okay.

1260
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,200
Yeah, some YouTube thing.

1261
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,200
Wonderful.

1262
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:14,080
Well, we do have a little bit of other news, at least I do, about Medal of Honor, which

1263
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:19,640
for anyone who tuned into Bobby's show earlier, they know this, or they can read, but they

1264
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:27,920
have decided to change the name of the multiplayer faction Taliban to Opposing Force.

1265
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:33,880
Yeah, they're doing it, as I said, out of respect for those in the military and for

1266
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:41,040
those who have lost family members in the war, and they're trying not to show any disrespect.

1267
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:47,280
I sort of have the opinion that they already had this in mind, and this was a ploy to get

1268
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:57,880
a little more publicity, but hey, if they're doing this, I mean, the name Opposing Force

1269
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:02,160
is kind of unimaginative.

1270
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
Generic much?

1271
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,160
Yeah, very generic.

1272
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:13,200
Because, I mean, wouldn't Opposing Force all be relative to what force you are opposing?

1273
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,400
They could just call it bad guys, they should just go, bad guys.

1274
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,000
Oh no, the bad guys.

1275
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,480
Then it's offensive to people who are bad.

1276
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,480
Oh no!

1277
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,480
Ah!

1278
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,000
They should just call it, red team?

1279
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Dudes.

1280
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Dudes.

1281
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Chicks.

1282
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,640
But see, then that's just sexist right there.

1283
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,640
Not really.

1284
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,720
I call everyone dudes, so that's not sexist.

1285
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:43,080
If you have chicks to find out in there as well, you just can't do that.

1286
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,400
It should be dudes and blokes.

1287
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Blokes.

1288
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Blokes.

1289
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,720
It works.

1290
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:53,000
And it can be a game about fisticuffs instead of guns.

1291
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,480
They can box each other and not punch.

1292
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
I don't know.

1293
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,040
Maybe it's a little too late, who knows.

1294
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,960
But at least they're, they're, they're trying.

1295
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,880
Darktads used to be just us versus them.

1296
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,320
But I don't want to be them, I want to be us.

1297
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
Oh no, I thought we were us.

1298
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,400
I'm me.

1299
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,400
It's me versus everybody.

1300
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,400
Die!

1301
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,120
Bah bah bah bah bah.

1302
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,120
No.

1303
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,120
Anyway.

1304
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,120
Misty says woot blokes.

1305
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,120
Yeah.

1306
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,800
Alright, well there's some new music games coming out in Japan because, well, that's

1307
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,800
what they do over there.

1308
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,480
They release music games.

1309
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:40,600
And of course, the sequel to Jubeat, Jubeat.net Append will be coming out, I guess, spring

1310
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,840
of 2011.

1311
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:52,080
And also, location tests, I guess, for XG2 are gonna be starting soon as well as Guitar

1312
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,240
Freak's Drummania V7.

1313
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:59,840
That's way too many damn games.

1314
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,160
That'll be starting very soon.

1315
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:10,000
And they haven't really said exactly when those location tests are actually gonna start.

1316
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,440
Same with Jubeat Ripples.

1317
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:18,080
That location test, sometime next year, but the only one announced so far is XG2.

1318
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,480
Why is it called Knit?

1319
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,760
I don't know.

1320
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,440
Why does Konami name anything like that?

1321
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,960
I want a knitting game.

1322
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,960
Not really.

1323
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,960
You can do that with the Wii.

1324
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,280
I believe there's Crafting Mama, so.

1325
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,280
Oh, okay.

1326
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,280
Close enough.

1327
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,960
I want Crochet Master.

1328
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,400
Ooh-hoo.

1329
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,880
You could call it Check My Hook.

1330
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,880
Womp-womp.

1331
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,280
To a guy who says, Fancy Nancy.

1332
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,280
Fancy Nancy.

1333
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Knit for Fancy Nancy.

1334
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,280
Oh, dear.

1335
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,920
In other news- Yes, please.

1336
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:09,200
Well, we all know how weird and perverted the internets can be, and so since the internets

1337
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:15,440
is full of weirdos and perverts, you have to take some measures to make sure that LEGO

1338
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,200
Universe can still be child-friendly.

1339
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:24,960
And so NetDevil has recently outlined a couple of measures that they are implementing to

1340
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:32,320
help protect the MMO's younger players, since it is targeted towards kids.

1341
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:37,520
And basically, it includes content moderation, which is no surprise to anyone, really.

1342
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:43,360
So you will have to get anything that you make, the name will have to be approved before

1343
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,520
it will go out into the LEGO Universe world.

1344
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,960
And the other part is a LEGO Universe ID, which is kind of- it actually sounds a lot

1345
01:23:53,960 --> 01:24:00,640
like Nintendo's friend code system, to where you give your LEGO Universe ID to other people

1346
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:06,360
outside of the game, and then they can see your creations that you've made even before

1347
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,120
they're approved, so.

1348
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,800
Protecting the innocent childrens from the weirdos of the internet, yay!

1349
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,120
And later on they will become the weirdos of the internet.

1350
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,600
Indeed, but on their own, not without the perversion of other people.

1351
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,800
Oh no, no, we can't have that.

1352
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,240
Think of the children.

1353
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,760
Think of the children and how crunchy they are.

1354
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:34,480
Well, it's time for another special segment of the show, this time I will actually use

1355
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,520
the correct music for.

1356
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,320
It's time for the mailbag!

1357
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:46,280
And I've got the rubber gloves on, it's bending its stinky self over, and I'm opening the

1358
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,440
bag, and ugh.

1359
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:54,760
This is kind of- because Rob hasn't cleaned out the spam filter like he does for me, so

1360
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,040
there's all kinds of- Read the spam!

1361
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,680
I don't know, read the spam, because I don't really care- there's spam in there about Lady

1362
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,680
Gaga, I should have left it in there for Rob, but I will.

1363
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,800
That's so Rob.

1364
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,800
Rob loves Lady Gaga.

1365
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,080
I have started appreciating Lady Gaga a little bit, but-

1366
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,120
Lady Gaga is stalking me.

1367
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,120
Really?

1368
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:20,560
Ever since I sang Lady Gaga for karaoke one time, now she's following me everywhere and

1369
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,240
she's like in my head.

1370
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:31,320
Now when you start busting out the asymmetrical wigs and dresses of meat-

1371
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,480
I don't look enough like Marilyn Manson to pull off any of Lady Gaga's looks.

1372
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:39,560
She was so much prettier before she went- anyway, I'm not gonna get into that.

1373
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,560
Greetings, O.L.R.

1374
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,080
I come to Loki with a non-gaming question that I think he'll have a good answer for.

1375
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,080
Ooh.

1376
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,080
Alright.

1377
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:51,600
Loki, I'm a contractor and my cell phone contract is up.

1378
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,520
What would you recommend for me?

1379
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,400
All I want is a family plan with no text, no data, and fifteen hundred plus minutes

1380
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,880
of phone a month.

1381
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,560
I've looked at the big four, didn't know if there's some weird hacker service that I'm

1382
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,560
unaware of.

1383
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,960
At the moment I'm leaning with T-Mobile because of price.

1384
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,080
Loki, can you help a desperate turtle?

1385
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,520
Your loyal turtle and Philly serious turtle.

1386
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,440
And disclaimer, Orange Hills Radio is not paid by any of the companies that might be

1387
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:20,520
mentioned and we should be even if they wanted to pay us.

1388
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:21,520
I don't know.

1389
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,120
Honestly, like I have a crap plan that didn't have any of that stuff and it's actually more

1390
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,840
expensive than the plans to have all that stuff, so go fig there.

1391
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,200
Just have to really kind of shop it.

1392
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:36,360
There's websites and stuff that you can actually, you know, put what you need for your plan

1393
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:42,080
and it will kind of shop everybody and tell you what the most affordable plan for you

1394
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,080
is.

1395
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:47,000
I can't think of the life of me what that website's called, but I know it's out there.

1396
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Google.

1397
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Well, it's not Google, it's something else.

1398
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,800
But you can do that.

1399
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:56,940
I'm planning on getting a phone through Virgin Mobile just because they're twenty-five dollars

1400
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:00,700
a month for, you know, three hundred minutes because I honestly use like twelve minutes

1401
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:04,080
a month if I'm lucky on my phone.

1402
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,960
So anything cheaper than that would be awesome.

1403
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,960
I was actually looking at a prepaid phone, but I think twenty-five dollars a month with

1404
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,960
no contract would not be that bad.

1405
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,820
And plus I can browse the Internet on that if I really want to.

1406
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,760
But I'm sorry I texted you earlier.

1407
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,060
I should give you a dollar.

1408
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,060
I don't care.

1409
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,060
It's all right.

1410
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,240
Well, we've got some suggestions from the chat room.

1411
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,920
Spazinator says to quote Monty Python, I hate spam.

1412
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,960
And that's wrong.

1413
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,960
It's I don't like spam!

1414
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,440
There you go.

1415
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,440
That's how you do it.

1416
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,880
SSJ100Matt says T-Mobile sucks and suggests Verizon.

1417
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,500
And Ron just suggests go with Sprint.

1418
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,500
Great coverage.

1419
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,500
Dirt cheap.

1420
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,160
Virgin also because they're piggybacking on the Sprint network, so.

1421
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,600
Spazinator uses Cricut.

1422
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,120
I use AT&T because I have an iPhone.

1423
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,620
And I basically use everything except the phone to call people.

1424
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,000
I do not call people.

1425
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,600
Only if it's necessary.

1426
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,160
Because I hate talking on the phone.

1427
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,240
I did it way too long for my job.

1428
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,240
Ugh.

1429
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:08,080
The only people I like talking to on the phone is like my mom.

1430
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,120
Because she's funny and frustrating at the same time.

1431
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,080
I'm pretty happy with Verizon myself.

1432
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,540
They're a little bit more expensive though, but I get better coverage from them.

1433
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:21,520
I have no reception for AT&T or Sprint within my house.

1434
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,640
And I do with Verizon, so you know, can't go wrong with that.

1435
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,120
I noticed that I didn't get as good reception in your house when I visited.

1436
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:33,040
Yep, it's AT&T and Sprint both have really crappy reception inside of my house.

1437
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,480
The AT&T is pretty good out, at least in Sacramento.

1438
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,520
So the next email comes up from Kamitsuyo.

1439
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,760
It says, hi everyone at OLR.

1440
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:47,200
I think it's time to revisit how Rob is doing on his quest to finish three games this summer.

1441
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,800
I haven't heard any talk of it lately.

1442
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,880
Considering the summer's over, yeah.

1443
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,600
That would be interesting to check out.

1444
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,800
Well that actually goes back to another email.

1445
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,440
Actually, no, that was the only email that we received that way.

1446
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:04,680
He had like a list of games that he was going to try to beat.

1447
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:13,960
And well, given that I have one of those, in fact, okay, here's the other email that

1448
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,960
we got.

1449
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,800
Someone else actually, oh it's the same guy, he expanded on his email.

1450
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,680
I knew someone else had something on it.

1451
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,160
Hey everyone at OLR, I've been listening to this show for about three years, it helps

1452
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,920
me get through some long days at work.

1453
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,920
Thank you.

1454
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,360
Anyway, what I'm writing about is an episode at the beginning of the summer when Rob talked

1455
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:32,560
about how he never finishes games and was dedicating himself to finish three games this

1456
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,560
summer.

1457
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,320
Haven't heard any progress on this or on the show lately.

1458
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:40,360
He has kind of inspired me to play several games to completion, which I have done several.

1459
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,640
Red Dead Redemption, Final Fantasy 13, Darksiders, Alan Wake, and currently working on God of

1460
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,360
War series on PS3.

1461
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,600
Just finished the first, along with a slew of 360 arcade games.

1462
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,120
Love the show, keep them coming, look forward to the big 10-year anniversary marathon.

1463
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,120
Stay black.

1464
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,120
Kamitsuyo.

1465
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:01,440
And, yeah, one of the games that Rob was supposed to finish was Final Fantasy 13, which is currently

1466
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,880
sitting in my living room, because I'm playing it.

1467
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:10,640
Of course I'm also playing the, I'm sitting down with that Avatar game finally, too.

1468
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:14,800
So we'll just have to make Rob fess up next week, won't we?

1469
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,800
Yes.

1470
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,560
And, last email.

1471
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,760
This is from Darkyusuke.

1472
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,480
Just had to note, whatever that Japanese game you brought up on Twitter, I swear it was

1473
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,480
a fucking hentai.

1474
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,120
Go back and listen for yourself and be the judge, XD.

1475
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,720
Hail the FSM, Darkyusuke.

1476
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,720
And that's it for email.

1477
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:32,720
Hmm.

1478
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:41,200
Well, if you have any emails you want to send us, it's mailbag at orangeandreo.com.

1479
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,200
Send it!

1480
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,720
A couple more final stories here.

1481
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:50,400
Actually, I think you have something that we need to do first.

1482
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,160
Hold on, someone just said that the stream went down.

1483
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,840
Although I don't think that it did, did it?

1484
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:03,280
Can you hear us, internets?

1485
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,200
This is a server's down, crap.

1486
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,360
Hold on.

1487
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,800
That's back online.

1488
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,800
Is it?

1489
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,800
Yeah.

1490
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,800
Shoutcast is saying that it's not.

1491
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,200
Oh, well.

1492
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,200
Hold on.

1493
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,840
Who crossed the streams?

1494
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,840
That's funny.

1495
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,560
Well, we'll just let him.

1496
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,520
When AMP, it froze, actually.

1497
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,520
When AMP froze.

1498
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,520
Ah, that sucks.

1499
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,520
Hold on.

1500
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,520
Tara, can you hit the chat room now?

1501
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,520
Yeah.

1502
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,520
Thanks.

1503
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,800
You probably want to make sure that part B saves.

1504
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,800
Maybe.

1505
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:42,520
Save it now, and we'll continue on with part three, if you will.

1506
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,520
I need to mark this down.

1507
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,520
3645.

1508
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,520
Shit!

1509
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,520
Where's my pen?

1510
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,520
Alright.

1511
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,520
What's up?

1512
01:31:51,520 --> 01:32:05,520
Are they hearing us now or something?

1513
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,520
No, I just like Loki's comment.

1514
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,520
And scene.

1515
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,520
Okay.

1516
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:15,520
I'm actually closing down when AMP, hold on.

1517
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:26,520
I'm going to reload it.

1518
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:44,520
All games radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.

1519
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
Yes, we are.

1520
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,520
Yay!

1521
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,520
Hold on.

1522
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:51,520
I've got to fix this to the right settings.

1523
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,520
Okay.

1524
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,520
43 encoder.

1525
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:04,520
What the hell was it?

1526
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,520
Hold on.

1527
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,520
44 kilobyte.

1528
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,520
96K.

1529
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,520
And we should be back.

1530
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,520
Are we back?

1531
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,520
Can you hear us, internets?

1532
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,520
Internets, are you there?

1533
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,520
Oh, crap.

1534
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,520
I forgot.

1535
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,520
We can't hear them.

1536
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,520
Alright, let us know in the chatroom if you can hear us.

1537
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,520
We had a little bit of an issue, which should be resolved now.

1538
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:29,520
And thankfully it only went down during mailbag.

1539
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,520
And I got to admit, it is your fault, chatroom.

1540
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,520
It really is.

1541
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,520
It really is.

1542
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,520
We know.

1543
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:41,520
And a DDR dollar bill says, I thought the dollocks were next week.

1544
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,520
No, no, no, no.

1545
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,520
So yeah, from what I understand, it went down during mailbag.

1546
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,520
So we'll make Rob edit it.

1547
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,520
Yay!

1548
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:54,520
Okay, so shall we move forward with our little podcast?

1549
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,520
Yes.

1550
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,520
Loki, rescue us.

1551
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,520
Actually, you can't rescue us right now.

1552
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,520
You know why?

1553
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,520
It's at the use of the week.

1554
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:10,520
Just in time for the stream to go down, huh?

1555
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,520
Timing is impeccable.

1556
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,520
Yes, it is.

1557
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:35,520
My F.U. of the week goes to the stream for going down while I was busy paying attention

1558
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,520
to other things.

1559
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,520
And for Rob going to Club 33 without me.

1560
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,520
Bitch.

1561
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,520
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

1562
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,520
Loki.

1563
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:51,520
F.U. to my headache that I've had for two days now.

1564
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,520
And it just won't go away.

1565
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,520
It's lack of sleep, really.

1566
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,520
But I've been trying to get sleep and just can't.

1567
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,520
You have a small person.

1568
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,520
Well, it's not even, yeah.

1569
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,520
It's a little bit him.

1570
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,520
Actually, it's all him.

1571
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,520
So, yeah, it's been very tiring to say the least.

1572
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,520
And, yeah.

1573
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,520
So that's F.U. to that.

1574
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,520
F.U. to the crappy drivers.

1575
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:22,520
I literally saw somebody pass somebody on the right within the same lane on my way here.

1576
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,520
And I was just like, really?

1577
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,520
Really?

1578
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,520
You just did that?

1579
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:30,520
You're in that much of a hurry that you need to pass somebody in the same lane on the wrong

1580
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:31,520
side?

1581
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,520
Awesome.

1582
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,520
Thank you.

1583
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,520
And F.U. to scammers.

1584
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:42,520
By the way, that brings us to our favorite, well, my new favorite topic, which is shoutouts

1585
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,520
to people on AOL Instant Messenger.

1586
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,520
In fact, we have somebody that you probably should give a shoutout to and let them know

1587
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,520
that they should really do the right thing.

1588
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:59,520
And that person would be PimpinTyler146 on AOL Instant Messenger.

1589
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,520
I will be posting his name in the chatroom and Twitter.

1590
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,520
Be sure to give him a nice little hi because he is a douchebag that didn't come through

1591
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,520
on his end of the transaction.

1592
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,520
So, I'm sure he'd love to hear from all of you.

1593
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,520
Tara, do you have any F.U.s?

1594
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,520
Yes, I do.

1595
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,520
F.U. to my work.

1596
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,520
Because not only am I working my normal shift, which is 9 to 6, not bad.

1597
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:31,520
But I'm also now working these extra days where I'm working until midnight or 1 a.m.

1598
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:38,520
And it's really messing up my sleep schedule and they don't want to pay me overtime.

1599
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,520
And on next Sunday I get to work from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.

1600
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:47,520
And that really, really sucks and I did not sign on for this and so F.U. my work.

1601
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,520
Don't they have to pay you overtime if you work more than a certain amount of hours?

1602
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,520
No, because I'm salary.

1603
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,520
Oh, that sucks.

1604
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,520
But they don't want to give me any incentives either.

1605
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,520
They just want to do this stuff and it's like this is not part of my job description.

1606
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,520
So, it's very upsetting.

1607
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:12,520
Well, that sucks. I hope there's some improvement soon.

1608
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:22,520
Well, now that the F.U.s are over and we're full of angst that we have now released onto the unsuspecting internet,

1609
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,520
Loki, do you have another story for us?

1610
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,520
Of course I do.

1611
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,520
And it's funny since you mentioned release.

1612
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:38,520
There is going to be a brand new peripheral coming to the Nintendo Wii remote.

1613
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:45,520
Unfortunately it is not something that is, say, approved by Nintendo.

1614
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,520
Or even something that you would, say, use with a Nintendo game.

1615
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,520
We've covered this.

1616
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:56,520
Yes, but they finally actually are going to be releasing them now.

1617
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:04,520
But these are Nintendo Wii remote accessories that are kind of...

1618
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,520
They're for dildonics basically.

1619
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,520
It's two different peripherals to use.

1620
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,520
And what the main function of this, obviously, is actually for chatting over the web.

1621
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,520
They're using the Wii remotes as kind of a Bluetooth adapter so that these things can vibrate.

1622
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:29,520
And you can remotely vibrate them across the web using, I guess, different programs.

1623
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,520
It's the Mojo Wejo is what it's actually called, the company.

1624
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:43,520
And I believe that they said they're going to be supporting a bunch of different chat applications.

1625
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:47,520
And I'm sure their own chat application as well.

1626
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,520
Is that what they're calling it these days?

1627
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:54,520
In the beta stage right now, but it'll be available for purchase in time for holiday season 2010.

1628
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:57,520
God, I would not want to be part of that beta test.

1629
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,520
I had to link a copy of that image in the chat room,

1630
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:05,520
but I think it's funny that there's a whole YouTube video describing how it's supposed to be used.

1631
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,520
It's intensely hilarious.

1632
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,520
Indeed.

1633
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:14,520
Intensely hilarious.

1634
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,520
I don't know. Even the name is just too ridiculous for me.

1635
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,520
Mojo Wejo.

1636
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,520
Mojo Wejo. See, even porn voice doesn't make Mojo Wejo sound good.

1637
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,520
No, it doesn't. And your porn voice is excellent.

1638
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,520
Thank you.

1639
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,520
You're welcome.

1640
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:45,520
Moving on, away from the porns, former Sega man Yuji Naka is working on an action game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 with Prope.

1641
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,520
And he hasn't revealed what the game is yet, but he will soon.

1642
01:39:51,520 --> 01:40:03,520
So according to Naka, they are doing a few quite big action game projects at Prope, but he didn't tell us anything about them.

1643
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:10,520
He did say that a very original action game based in the sky will be revealed within this month.

1644
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,520
So that's something to look forward to.

1645
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,520
I hope it has airships. Yay, airships!

1646
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,520
I wonder if it's going to be Skies of Arcadia.

1647
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,520
Ooh, maybe.

1648
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,520
Could be.

1649
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,520
It's based in the sky and it involves airships.

1650
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,520
Indeed.

1651
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:33,520
Well, we will know soon according to Naka-san, right?

1652
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:38,520
Yes, soon. Within this month, they are going to tell us about his project.

1653
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:45,520
Well, that should hopefully be cool. I don't think Yuji Naka's done anything that's really sucked that bad.

1654
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:57,520
So, now it is time for a special part of the show where you, the caller, get to come and speak to us if we can get it to work.

1655
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,520
So I'm going to go ahead and make this disclaimer right now.

1656
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:10,520
Because we do have Tiara in through Skype, I'm going to try to get these to work as a conference call so we don't have to disconnect on her.

1657
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:19,520
So, I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now and go ahead and make your calls.

1658
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,520
I'm not going to play any music.

1659
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,520
Call!

1660
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,520
Ah, yes.

1661
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,520
This is while we do the waiting game. Hi, Dan!

1662
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,520
Riveting.

1663
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,520
It is riveting.

1664
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:41,520
Hey, we got a call. I'm going to answer.

1665
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:45,520
Hello, you're talking to Orange Lounge Radio. Who is this?

1666
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,520
This is DJ Blaziken.

1667
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,520
Hi, DJ Blaziken. How are you?

1668
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:58,520
I'm doing fine and I just found a solution for all DSI owners that might be listening in.

1669
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:07,520
I found this out through the internet and through the grace of it because I don't know if any of you guys have had this problem,

1670
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:13,520
but I have and I'm sure there might be a few others that might have had this.

1671
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:23,520
The L and R buttons becoming not able to be fixed when hit and you'd have to end up coming through mashing them in.

1672
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:31,520
Well, but the thing is, the little gap that lets it go down is basically letting dust in.

1673
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:37,520
Basically, best bet, take a little mini vac or whatever you have to suck the dirt out and do exactly that.

1674
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:44,520
It's supposed to, actually it's made my DS work again. Fully functional again.

1675
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:52,520
Well, thank you for sharing the tip with us. I'm glad it's worked for you. I'm sure other people have had similar issues.

1676
01:42:52,520 --> 01:43:01,520
Yeah, and other than that, my original DS, well the second DS that I've ever owned,

1677
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:10,520
started to completely fail on me and ended up spending, well going broke really on a new DS Lite

1678
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,520
and it was actually the last one in the batch, but it was well worth it.

1679
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:23,520
With Pokemon HeartGold, which is kind of a, I don't know, basically just HeartGold with the crystal and yellow features

1680
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,520
sort of slapped into it with new DS graphics.

1681
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:31,520
Well, that's pretty cool, but I'll tell you what, we're getting other calls in, so I need to go ahead and let you go.

1682
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,520
Thank you for calling.

1683
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,520
Otherwise, I do give it a 10 out of 10.

1684
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,520
Okay, thank you for calling. Bye bye.

1685
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,520
Shut up. I think that was DS Master.

1686
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:49,520
And I am super professional. Oscar says I'm super professional. Let's make sure that we haven't,

1687
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:58,520
I'm gonna see if I can't get Marin off of, off of, are you there?

1688
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,520
Yes, I am.

1689
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,520
Okay, so this is what we're gonna do now for future calls.

1690
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:09,520
I want people to, um, I'm gonna add the conference. Aha! It worked.

1691
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,520
Hello, who are we talking to?

1692
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:18,520
Quark, anyway, hello you, across the ocean.

1693
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,520
Hello, AK Ripper, how are you?

1694
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,520
I'm doing just fine on this Monday morning.

1695
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,520
And we do have Tara on the line still too.

1696
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,520
Monday morning? Are you from the future?

1697
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,520
No, I just live in this place called Sweden.

1698
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,520
Ooh, Sweden.

1699
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,520
Where I'm all like, I'm like, well, what is it? I'm eight hours ahead of you.

1700
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,520
That means you are from the future.

1701
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:47,520
You are from the future.

1702
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,520
What's the future like?

1703
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,520
Our future is Swedish.

1704
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,520
Are there flying cars? Tell us, I must know.

1705
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,520
No, no, nothing of that yet. Unfortunately.

1706
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:03,520
But since you're in Sweden, you have awesome chocolate, right?

1707
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:09,520
Um, no, I don't, no, no, no, no, you're thinking of like Switzerland or...

1708
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,520
What does Sweden have that's awesome? Tell us about Sweden.

1709
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,520
What do we have that's awesome? Well, we, ahem...

1710
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:26,520
Oh, that's like, we have, what do we have? Well...

1711
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,520
Damn!

1712
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,520
Prostitution?

1713
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,520
Oh, okay.

1714
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,520
No, no, no, no, that's legal actually.

1715
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,520
Hot hookers!

1716
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,520
No, no, that's legal.

1717
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,520
We have prostitution in Las Vegas.

1718
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,520
No, that's Amsterdam, sorry.

1719
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,520
Oh, whatever.

1720
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,520
But anyways, what's on your mind, dude?

1721
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:49,520
Oh, well, ahem, what do I call? Oh, well, something of some sort.

1722
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,520
Crap.

1723
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,520
Oh, yeah, you forgot to talk about something.

1724
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:02,520
Dragon Age Ultimate Edition is coming, is coming soon.

1725
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:06,520
Well, somewhere around December or something.

1726
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:10,520
And, well, the funny thing is that I've just been reminded.

1727
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,520
I did buy Dragon Age on launch day and I haven't played it.

1728
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:19,520
The reason I've just been reminded is that I play it on a PC and...

1729
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:25,520
Funny story is that my computer that I play it on, you can unlock it.

1730
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:31,520
You can unlock all the four cores since two of them is disabled by default of sorts.

1731
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,520
And that makes Dragon Age load up pretty fast.

1732
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:43,520
But then the two cores was really faulty, so I had to disable them.

1733
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:52,520
And then I was like, I don't want to play this slow loading game, so I'm going to play it when I have a quad core.

1734
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:57,520
And I still don't have a quad core, so I'm just going to wait even more.

1735
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:03,520
I think you should just suck it up and play the game, because Dragon Age Origins is an awesome game.

1736
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,520
It's the best game ever and you're really missing out.

1737
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:13,520
See, you have Dragon Age Origins in Sweden, that's what you have, but you're neglecting it.

1738
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:23,520
Well, to be honest, I'm playing that thing called Sims 3 and I'm eagerly waiting nightlife.

1739
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,520
Yeah, that's going to be fun. I'm probably going to get it well after everybody else has had it.

1740
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:34,520
The chatroom also would like to inform us that Sweden has Ikea.

1741
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:43,520
Yeah, but the part where I live in Sweden, we don't.

1742
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:55,520
We have it, but I have to go like, well, what is it? 250 kilometers or something?

1743
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,520
That's a distance.

1744
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,520
Yes, it is.

1745
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,520
We've also been informed about Roxette, Ace of Base, and Abba.

1746
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:07,520
So, since Sweden has lots of stuff, how come you don't know this?

1747
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:18,520
Well, because I'm like one of those, in some way, uneducated bastards that lives in a cave of sorts.

1748
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,520
That's okay, you're like the rest of us.

1749
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:29,520
Where we live in our caves called our computer rooms and don't come out except when we need to eat and go to the bathroom.

1750
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:34,520
Yeah, that's one up on this one, too.

1751
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:44,520
So, I have a challenge for you. By the end of the month, you must start Dragon Age Origins.

1752
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
Yes, that is the challenge.

1753
01:48:46,520 --> 01:49:08,520
Well, in one way, I've been reminded. I have played a few of the origin stories, and then afterwards I just get bored by some strange reason.

1754
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:12,520
So, you have gamer ADD?

1755
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:17,520
Yeah, well, and I actually have real ADD, too.

1756
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,520
That would contribute.

1757
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,520
If we ought to go that way.

1758
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,520
That would contribute.

1759
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,520
Well, AkiRipper, I appreciate the call.

1760
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,520
Are we doing okay without Rob?

1761
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:46,520
Yeah, you're doing just fine. Because, well, in some way I would say, more of this in the future, please, even though it's like, sorry, Rob, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

1762
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:51,520
Yeah, that's the way in. Yeah, something.

1763
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,520
I don't know, I'm just this worthless foreigner of whatever.

1764
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:03,520
Oh, you are not a worthless foreigner, we adore you. But we need to go ahead and let you go, we've got another call coming in, okay?

1765
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,520
Yeah, later.

1766
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,520
Take care.

1767
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,520
Bye-bye.

1768
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:13,520
Hello, caller. You are on Orange Jones Radio. Who be thee?

1769
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,520
I be DDR Dollar Bill.

1770
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,520
Hi.

1771
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:21,520
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill. What's on your mind?

1772
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:31,520
Oh, not much. I just want to give an update about the PlayStation 3 that I got a couple weeks back, that I finally purchased it.

1773
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,520
Yay!

1774
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:33,520
Yeah.

1775
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,520
Congrats.

1776
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,520
What's that?

1777
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,520
I said congrats.

1778
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:45,520
Oh, thanks, thanks. It's, it makes a nice little, it's, it's a lot better to watch DVDs on that, to give you that much.

1779
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,520
But the move, I didn't like it at all.

1780
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:58,520
I found out that you asked for me, I actually have to be about six feet away from the TV, and unfortunately, I don't have that much room in my apartment.

1781
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
Oh, that sucks.

1782
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:10,520
Yeah, so, I mean, I went forward, and it would, it stopped detecting, and I was only like maybe four feet away from the screen, and I said, uh, no, this is not gonna work.

1783
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:15,520
Is there any way that you could wall-mount, like, a receptor or something?

1784
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,520
I have, well...

1785
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,520
I think you should mount it onto your ceiling.

1786
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:24,520
That's at least six feet away. Right?

1787
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:28,520
I'd have to lay down on the floor to do that, though.

1788
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,520
I'd be laying on the floor waving my stick.

1789
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
Wait, that doesn't look right at all.

1790
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:36,520
Well, then...

1791
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:49,520
Yeah, but, uh, just wanna save that, and I've got a lot of enjoyment out of it for one big reason. No fucking batteries on the controllers.

1792
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:56,520
It was such a play, I enjoyed just actually plugging the controllers, get it going. Alright, we got multiplayer.

1793
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,520
That's always a plus.

1794
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:08,520
Yeah, so, so let's, oh, hold on a second. There we go, I'm sorry, I was hearing myself repeat myself.

1795
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,520
You had to do what to yourself?

1796
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:14,520
No, I was hearing my voice come in an echo, I was like, why?

1797
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,520
Maybe, maybe you've got your, you're too close to your speakers or something to that effect?

1798
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,520
You have to be at least six feet away.

1799
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:27,520
You must be at least six feet away to enjoy this podcast.

1800
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:34,520
Yeah, so, the biggest hits so far in the household is LittleBigPlanet and ModNation Racers.

1801
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:39,520
How do you like ModNation Racers? I've been meaning to play that.

1802
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:44,520
Okay, before we go into it, I'm gonna say this again, this is just a disclaimer.

1803
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:50,520
I thought Super Mario Kart on the SNES was the biggest piece of shit that ever existed.

1804
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:57,520
I'm sorry, I thought the controls sucked horribly and the perspective just, I couldn't play it.

1805
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,520
I had to wait till the N64 version just to even be able to play it.

1806
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:06,520
But for ModNation, what I loved about it is that anybody could pick it up.

1807
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:10,520
Anybody could pick up and guide us to the game right away.

1808
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,520
Well, that's always a plus with a game. I think that if it's a game that's that simple to play,

1809
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,520
then it's definitely better to get more people in on it too.

1810
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:27,520
Oh, exactly. Especially when they can't just design their own characters and cars and even tracks.

1811
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:33,520
When they start doing the tracks, that's gonna be a lot more fun because we can just recreate anything we want.

1812
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,520
Especially around New York, we got no shortage of tracks to replicate.

1813
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:42,520
So, I need to ask you something. As a dude, I have to ask you this.

1814
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:49,520
What is it about being able to customize your characters? Isn't that a lot like Barbie dolls for dudes?

1815
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:56,520
Like, okay. When we have all these wrestling games and my husband would try to make the wrestlers look all cool and stuff,

1816
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:59,520
I'm like, dude, it's like you're playing dress up.

1817
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,520
It really is.

1818
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,520
In essence, you're half way right. It is kind of like doing Barbie.

1819
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,520
But it's manly Barbie.

1820
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,520
And wrestling is like soap opera for dudes.

1821
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,520
It is.

1822
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,520
Oh, no disagreements.

1823
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:18,520
Oh, they got her drunk and they got married. Oh no.

1824
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,520
Triple H. Sorry.

1825
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,520
Look, I'm coming back from the dead again.

1826
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:31,520
Oh, now it's the under biker.

1827
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:37,520
No, he's back to Undertaker, like the dead guy again. He was a biker for a while though.

1828
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:41,520
The under biker was. Now we're on wrestling, sorry.

1829
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,520
It's alright. He lost tonight anyway.

1830
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,520
Oh, really? It's been that long. I'm like, I don't know who any of these people are anymore.

1831
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,520
That's terrible that they wrote that into the script, that he would lose.

1832
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,520
He lost by getting hit with the urn.

1833
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
What?

1834
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,520
They wrote that all back in there. They're going way back.

1835
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,520
Wow.

1836
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,520
They went backwards.

1837
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:09,520
Given that I remember playing WrestleMania in the arcade, and you could choose the Undertaker.

1838
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,520
When I was a kid.

1839
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,520
Oh, yeah.

1840
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,520
The under biker needs to retire.

1841
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:19,520
You're not the only one who's saying that.

1842
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:30,520
Well, anyway, thank you for clearing this up for me because I've always wondered if it's just the same sort of little giddy joy in making them look pretty.

1843
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:33,520
Like pretty, pretty ponies.

1844
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:39,520
Just to add to it, in the wrestling games, it's also a joy now where you can actually create your own finisher.

1845
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:43,520
So now it's not just, ooh, you look pretty. Like, ooh, I can kick your ass pretty.

1846
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,520
That's... I've never heard someone say, I can kick your ass pretty.

1847
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:51,520
I don't know. Just a moment of thought.

1848
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:55,520
Did you ever play WrestleMania 2000 on Nintendo 64?

1849
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,520
Yes.

1850
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:03,520
We made this guy who was part of G Generation X and we would just put him on watch mode and he beat everybody.

1851
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:09,520
He won every belt, including the women's belt.

1852
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,520
Oh, gosh. When the AI was actually that easily manipulative. Nice.

1853
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:19,520
Exactly. Anyway, this isn't wrestling chat. This is Orange on Radio.

1854
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,520
Agreed. Video games, but...

1855
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,520
Are you sure about that?

1856
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,520
We talked about food in part A. We did already get our food out of our system.

1857
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,520
That sounds bad. That's more like what we do during the break is get our food out of our system.

1858
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,520
Speaking of which, I got my pizza here to eat too.

1859
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,520
Why don't we let you get to your pizza?

1860
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
What kind of pizza do you have?

1861
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:41,520
Take care.

1862
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,520
Alright, you too. Bye.

1863
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,520
Bye bye.

1864
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,520
Ah, pizza and wrestling.

1865
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:52,520
So reminds me of my early years with my husband.

1866
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,520
How romantic.

1867
01:56:54,520 --> 01:57:01,520
Well, you know how we got engaged was watching UHF and drinking Manischewitz wine, which should have set a precedence there.

1868
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,520
Yep.

1869
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:10,520
So do we have any other callers? Because if you don't, I'm closing the line and you're all SOL.

1870
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
Five, four...

1871
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:15,520
Misty is supposed to call. Call Misty.

1872
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:25,520
Misty, call. You must call. You must call. Or we'll call you. Conferencing you in in just about a minute. Are you on?

1873
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:30,520
Ooh, she's sneaky.

1874
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:33,520
I do not see her in the list of people who are on the lines.

1875
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,520
Aww.

1876
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:40,520
Oh, there we go. Let's see.

1877
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:43,520
Nope, I do not see a Misty.

1878
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,520
Call us.

1879
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,520
Call us.

1880
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:51,520
Oh, we got another one in, but it's not Misty. Let's see who this is.

1881
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:57,520
Hello, you're on Orange Jones Radio. Who are you whoring yourself out today?

1882
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:01,520
I'm whoring myself to whoever has the highest amount of money for me.

1883
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,520
Oh baby, oh baby.

1884
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,520
Hi Rhonda.

1885
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,520
Hey, hey, what's up?

1886
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
Hi Ron-Chan.

1887
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,520
My Ron-Chan, oh hi.

1888
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,520
Let me see what you did there.

1889
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,520
No, I do try.

1890
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,520
How are you doing today?

1891
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:27,520
I am doing good. Would you believe I just finished, I just finished editing my podcast to get it and it's...

1892
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,520
Huh?

1893
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
Did you cut it out?

1894
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,520
Oh, here we go. Sorry about that. I hit the mute button by accident.

1895
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:43,520
Remember, don't hit the mute button. Never hit the mute button because then you'll end up sounding like this while you're trying to talk.

1896
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,520
No, and we can't have that now.

1897
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,520
No.

1898
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:59,520
Just finished editing our podcast and it just went up blind and I'm looking at all the emails of all the gaming demos that's going on at New York Anime Festival slash Comic Con this weekend.

1899
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:02,520
Ooh, do tell.

1900
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:07,520
Okay, first email I got is from the people behind DC Universe.

1901
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,520
Ooh.

1902
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:17,520
And which is also interesting, the Marvel Superhero MMO will be playable as well.

1903
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,520
Yay.

1904
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:25,520
I'm looking at a graphic of it. It's pretty much, it's the Marvel Superhero Squad online game. Looks interesting.

1905
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,520
Oh, that's cute. That should be adorable.

1906
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:35,520
Definitely. And I also got an email from Sega so they'll be showing up on the new Thor game.

1907
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,520
Oh, cool.

1908
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:45,520
And I am curious about DC Online because this will be the second time I've ever played a PS3 in my entire life.

1909
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,520
Really?

1910
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:53,520
Yeah, first time I played it was at some gaming con. I played around with Street Fighter IV. Only thing that annoyed me was the load time.

1911
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,520
Yeah.

1912
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,520
I much prefer that on Xbox.

1913
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:05,520
It's funny though, I only bought Street Fighter IV only because I know the person that does the voice of Ryu in the game.

1914
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,520
Really?

1915
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
Yes.

1916
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:12,520
Who is it? I mean, what other stuff has he done that I would recognize?

1917
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:17,520
His name is Kyle Hebert, and did you ever watch the dub Dragon Ball Z?

1918
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,520
I tried not to, but I have it sometimes.

1919
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,520
He did the voice of adult Gohan.

1920
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:23,520
Oh.

1921
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,520
Oh, okay.

1922
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,520
He was actually one of the ones that wasn't annoying.

1923
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
Mm-hmm.

1924
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:33,520
Of the very few that were not annoying, he was one of them.

1925
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,520
Yeah.

1926
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:45,520
He wasn't the older adult Gohan when Viz and Pioneer dubbed it. He was part of the Funimation cast when they redubbed the series.

1927
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:53,520
Yeah, I think I pieced it together when you said it because I remembered Ryu's English voice.

1928
02:00:53,520 --> 02:01:02,520
Okay, and that end, I don't remember how many episodes they dubbed it before Funimation took over. It's just like a giant blur to me.

1929
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,520
Dragon Ball Z is a giant blur to me.

1930
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:16,520
Well, with Dragon Ball Kai, which is supposed to be more of the manga-based version, or I like to call it Dragon Ball Z Kai, less filler refs, still tastes great.

1931
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,520
That's pretty funny.

1932
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:23,520
So the battle with Cell only takes like five episodes instead of 73?

1933
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,520
Pretty much. Pretty much.

1934
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:38,520
Seriously, when I had my fan subs of the Cell episodes, they were seriously over four VHS tapes at whatever the long play was. SLP.

1935
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,520
Wow.

1936
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,520
Yeah. That's way too much.

1937
02:01:42,520 --> 02:02:05,520
I remember the first time I watched the fans of Dragon Ball Z. Me and my cousin were at his grandmother's house watching it, and it was third or fourth generation VHS tape because as we're watching it, the video quality was so bad that it would just flip to blue screen every three minutes, and we're just sitting there glued to the TV, watching every single minute of it.

1938
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,520
That sounds like my first experience is watching Ranma 1-1-2.

1939
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:17,520
When my first copies were fan subs from the Ranma project, about four, five generations old.

1940
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:27,520
I remember that. I remember there was this comic book shop I used to periodically hang out at, and they actually had the fan sub copies.

1941
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:34,520
But the thing is, I liked the price of these often. It was like two episodes for like 20 bucks. I'm like, nah, that can stay on the shelf.

1942
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:38,520
I remember the old days when you traded fan subs.

1943
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,520
I remember that.

1944
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,520
Ah, memories.

1945
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,520
I still have all my fan subs in storage.

1946
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,520
Now we download them off the internet.

1947
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:52,520
Shh, shh, don't say that. We're not supposed to.

1948
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:55,520
How else am I gonna get my Digimon fix?

1949
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,520
Well, did you know they actually-

1950
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,520
I'm watching the new series of Digimon.

1951
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,520
Do you know they actually re-fan subbed on Digimon?

1952
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:04,520
Uh, don't know.

1953
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:06,520
Eh.

1954
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:08,520
Don't get me started.

1955
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,520
So how about more video games?

1956
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,520
I do butterfly, the opening theme.

1957
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,520
How about more video games? What else is gonna be up there?

1958
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,520
That's basically it. That's all the information I have here.

1959
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:24,520
Also, there's another company called Game Tech that's supposed to be there.

1960
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:32,520
They're probably doing these little flash-based games or something like that. That's my assumption.

1961
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,520
They're not saying too much about it.

1962
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:40,520
They're gonna be the Kenshiya Hall of your convention.

1963
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:53,520
To be perfectly honest, the Kenshiya Hall of Comic Con is like the little room in the back where it's open gaming and then people try to get up on stage and make fools of themselves.

1964
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:58,520
That's always the best part of cons, is people making fools of themselves. In costume!

1965
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:00,520
Oh, I'll definitely be in costume.

1966
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:01,520
So what's your cosplay this year?

1967
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:12,520
Speaking of in costume, I am looking for pieces for a River Song cosplay from the end of the last Doctor Who series.

1968
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:19,520
So if you know somebody who can help me out with finding some pieces for that, I would be much appreciative.

1969
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:28,520
I'm probably the minority in my group that does not watch Doctor Who, only because I have so much stuff on my plate to watch I have no time for it.

1970
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:31,520
Tisk, tisk, tisk.

1971
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:36,520
Hey, if it helps, I watched some of the original stuff from the 60s and the 70s.

1972
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,520
That's what I grew up on.

1973
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,520
Yeah, on public access.

1974
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:42,520
Fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.

1975
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:59,520
Okay, well if Ron Chan can't help me, somebody on the interwebs that is hearing this, the tens of people who listen to this show, there are a lot, so if you would like to help me out with some River Song cosplay so that I can go to the Laguna Beach Comic Con.

1976
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,520
Is that the one? No, I'm going to Long Beach Comic Con at the end of this month, so...

1977
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:06,520
In the old home of Onomatopoeia Expo.

1978
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,520
Yes.

1979
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:17,520
Oh, I remember that place, and I remember walking all over that section of Long Beach in four inch platform heels. Not fun.

1980
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,520
Not smart.

1981
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,520
No, but I was cosplaying.

1982
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,520
Kinda sexy.

1983
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,520
But for the record, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary.

1984
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:26,520
Okay.

1985
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,520
Ah.

1986
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:33,520
Hence the boots and walking around in wings in a crowded dealer's room. Not smart. I didn't do it again.

1987
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:43,520
Well, Tiara, I can't say this much, but I actually do know a couple of people out in the Vegas area that are cosplayers, so I may be able to cash in a favor or two.

1988
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:55,520
Um, if one of them is somebody that I think it is, that might be a creepy person from high school that I went to high school with, so maybe not.

1989
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,520
Male or female?

1990
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,520
Male.

1991
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:03,520
You're in luck, they're all females. Most of the cosplayers I know and commissioners are female, so you're good.

1992
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,520
Okay, good. Okay, good.

1993
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,520
I got you, I got you.

1994
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
No creeps for you today.

1995
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:13,520
Yay, one day creep free.

1996
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:16,520
Except when DS Master called in.

1997
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:20,520
Well, I missed that call, so...

1998
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,520
That's right, you were on hold.

1999
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:23,520
Yep.

2000
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:29,520
Well, Ron-Chan, thank you for your call, and you need to get your ass back out here soon.

2001
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:36,520
As soon as I get some cash monies, me and Joe there and Missy will come out there and invade for a weekend or two or three.

2002
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:40,520
Or everybody compile and get me out there, because I don't want to be in California.

2003
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,520
Yeah, I want to go to New York.

2004
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:46,520
Yeah, we need to make the Send Jamie and Tiara to New York fund.

2005
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:55,520
Yeah, and DDR dollar bill said I should ship myself there, but I don't know how many air holes I would need, so I'm not sure if that would work.

2006
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,520
Thirty-two.

2007
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,520
Thirty-two, okay.

2008
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:05,520
Not to mention that they put you in one of those non-compressed compartments and you'll freeze to death, so that's not good.

2009
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:07,520
Yeah, that would kind of suck.

2010
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,520
Oh hey, Loki, when did you show up?

2011
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,520
Oh, I've been here.

2012
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,520
Oh, okay.

2013
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,520
He's been looking up porn and playing the magical unicorn fart game.

2014
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:17,520
I've been doing either of those, but yes.

2015
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:21,520
That would explain why the stream went out. Bad Loki. Bad Loki.

2016
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:24,520
No, it went out from spam overload from the email.

2017
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,520
Eat.

2018
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:27,520
Yeah.

2019
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:30,520
So, do you have anything else for us?

2020
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:33,520
Give us more.

2021
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,520
No, that's pretty much it, yeah.

2022
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,520
Alright, well we are going to let you go. Reluctantly, reluctantly.

2023
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:41,520
We love the mall.

2024
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:44,520
So, take care, and thank you for calling in.

2025
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:45,520
Will do.

2026
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:46,520
Anytime.

2027
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:47,520
You are fantabulous.

2028
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,520
Bye-bye.

2029
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,520
Bye.

2030
02:07:49,520 --> 02:08:03,520
Okay, I think that we're about called out. I'm going to leave room for one more call, and if not, then we'll go ahead and ask for any last-minute stories and wrap the show up in ribbons and bows and call it pretty.

2031
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:05,520
Yay, so pretty.

2032
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:09,520
Shadowrunner says someone should cosplay Billy Mitchell.

2033
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:21,520
You know what, all that makes me do is when I hear the scout doing the slap shop commercial.

2034
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,520
Hold on, somebody fill time.

2035
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,520
Time fill, woo.

2036
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,520
Oh, I know. It's Misty's birthday, so.

2037
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:30,520
We should say happy birthday to Misty.

2038
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:39,520
Happy birthday, Misty. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Misty, happy birthday to you.

2039
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:44,520
Yay, now send us cake. Fresh, fresh cake.

2040
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,520
Yes, cake. Or cupcakes.

2041
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
I love cupcakes.

2042
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:49,520
Me too.

2043
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:55,520
Oh, wait, wait, wait, Rama's telling everyone to tell Jevdea to call in and do coffee talk.

2044
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:59,520
Coffee talk with Jamie and Tiara.

2045
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:05,520
Give us a call, we'll talk. No big whoop.

2046
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:09,520
That Madonna is such a skank.

2047
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,520
That was my favorite coffee talk.

2048
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:17,520
With Madonna and Roseanne Barr and then Barbara showed up.

2049
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:20,520
Because she's like, butta.

2050
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:27,520
Okay, I'm still trying to find this, hold on.

2051
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,520
I can't find it. Where is it?

2052
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:35,520
Shadowrunner says the cake is a lie, but pie is constant. This is true.

2053
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,520
That is true.

2054
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:41,520
Pie is constant.

2055
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,520
I can't spell today.

2056
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,520
Well, last minute stories, I guess.

2057
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,520
Yes, please.

2058
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,520
Retailers are apparently listing Duke Nukem Forever for February 1st.

2059
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:57,520
I can tell you right now that's just an estimate because they haven't really given up the exact release date yet.

2060
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:01,520
I'm assuming it's February, though, because we have it listed in February as well.

2061
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:05,520
But not the 1st, because that would be wrong.

2062
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:10,520
Well, here, I've loaded this up. Oh, we've got another call coming in, hold on.

2063
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,520
Let me add them to our call.

2064
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:16,520
Hello, you're calling in Orange Falls Radio. Who is this?

2065
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,520
This is Jevdea.

2066
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,520
Hi!

2067
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,520
Hello!

2068
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:26,520
You've called! Now we can talk!

2069
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:31,520
We can talk, so we can have...

2070
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:33,520
We can discuss.

2071
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,520
We can hasing.

2072
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:44,520
So how are you?

2073
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:47,520
I'm well. My nose hurts.

2074
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,520
Why did your nose hurt?

2075
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:53,520
I pierced my system.

2076
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,520
Fun!

2077
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:59,520
That sounds about as fun as putting a hole in your face.

2078
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:02,520
Something like that.

2079
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:06,520
Why did you go and do a silly thing like this?

2080
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:11,520
I had the time and I had the money.

2081
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,520
If you've got the time and money, you should just come out here!

2082
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,520
Exactly.

2083
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,520
No!

2084
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,520
It's less painful!

2085
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:25,520
I was on a weekend vacation at a barbecue competition thing.

2086
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,520
It was at the beach, so I did it.

2087
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:34,520
It's the weekend that's not being able to go out to California.

2088
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:37,520
Everybody else put holes in their noses with you, too?

2089
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:39,520
Oh, I guess you did.

2090
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:43,520
So, what's going on on your gaming front?

2091
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:48,520
I'm actually trying to play through the Lego games again.

2092
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,520
Oh, yay!

2093
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:53,520
I'm trying to play through Batman now.

2094
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,520
Lego Batman is so much fun. I love that game.

2095
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,520
It absolutely is.

2096
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:01,520
No! I'm having so much fun with it.

2097
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,520
And it's just absolutely ridiculous.

2098
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,520
It's fantastic, innocent fun.

2099
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:12,520
I think Lego Indiana Jones is still my favorite, though.

2100
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:15,520
But I have a soft spot for Indy.

2101
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:18,520
Even though he's old and walking around with a cane.

2102
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:21,520
Yeah, I had that for the DS.

2103
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,520
And I liked it on DS.

2104
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,520
I had Batman for the DS, too, and I played that like crazy.

2105
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:29,520
So now I'm just trying to get through everything on the 360.

2106
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,520
Did you play through Arkham Asylum?

2107
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,520
No, I haven't. I do not have it.

2108
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:39,520
I'm trying to wait for it to come down in price and find it down at price.

2109
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:42,520
If I can find it cheap, I will send you a copy.

2110
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:43,520
$39.99.

2111
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,520
If I can find it cheap and use it somewhere, I will find you a copy.

2112
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,520
Okay.

2113
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,520
It's really worthwhile.

2114
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:56,520
In fact, I think I saw it at one of our local used music and game stores

2115
02:12:56,520 --> 02:13:01,520
for like 20, I want to say.

2116
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,520
We'll work out something after the show. You can PayPal me.

2117
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:07,520
Okay. All right. That sounds good.

2118
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:10,520
Even though I still have to send a sound board to Tiara.

2119
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:12,520
Oops.

2120
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:15,520
I still have stuff to mail you, too, so it's okay.

2121
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:18,520
And you only sound vaguely Atlantean.

2122
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,520
Yes.

2123
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:26,520
Well, I totally suggest the Arkham Asylum game. It's pretty fun.

2124
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,520
You can also just go around.

2125
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:32,520
The best thing to do in that game is to get up on the gargoyle heads in some of these areas

2126
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:36,520
and then drop down behind people upside down all crazy-like.

2127
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:39,520
You pick them up and beat the crap out of them and drop them down.

2128
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,520
It's just awesome badminton.

2129
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:42,520
It sounds fun.

2130
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:43,520
I know.

2131
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:45,520
See, that's the kind of stuff that I do in Metal Gear.

2132
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,520
I just go up behind people and just strengthen them.

2133
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,520
Snap their necks.

2134
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,520
See, now in my head I've got Rob's voice going,

2135
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,520
LOL, you're dead.

2136
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:59,520
That's the kind of crap that I do in video games, though.

2137
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:00,520
I like that stuff.

2138
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:02,520
You like the ninja.

2139
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,520
Yes. Yes.

2140
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:07,520
I think that makes me a little violent, though, but that's okay.

2141
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:10,520
Oh, there's nothing wrong with that. You have to blow off steam somehow.

2142
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:13,520
Yeah, exactly.

2143
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:15,520
So I do it on video games.

2144
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:18,520
And two people. And nice one did that.

2145
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:21,520
Because we know the difference between gaming and reality.

2146
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,520
And as much as we imagine doing it to people in real life,

2147
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:27,520
we do not actually do it.

2148
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:31,520
No, we just wish that the video games were real sometimes.

2149
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,520
DDRdollarBill says, remind me not to piss her off ever

2150
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:39,520
and doesn't want to have this next snap silently.

2151
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:42,520
Yes, let's not do that for reals.

2152
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:47,520
Or what was the line in Silence Good, but let's play Metal Gear for real.

2153
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:56,520
Alright. Well, do you have anything else that you wish to discuss with us?

2154
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:00,520
No, I was just calling in to say hi, basically.

2155
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:02,520
Well, hello. We're glad that you called.

2156
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:04,520
Yes, indeed.

2157
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:05,520
I hope so.

2158
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,520
Batman!

2159
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,520
She's Batman.

2160
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:12,520
She's Batman.

2161
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:16,520
Well, you take care, and we will end it on Batman.

2162
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,520
Batman!

2163
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,520
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na phone call!

2164
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:23,520
Okay.

2165
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:27,520
Okay, that's it for Skype.

2166
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:33,520
I'm going to go ahead and go on the Do Not Disturb.

2167
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,520
Because I will not answer any more of your insolent questions.

2168
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,520
Do Not Disturb.

2169
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:43,520
I will no longer respond to your insolence.

2170
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,520
I'm done. Do you have any more last minute stories for us, Loki?

2171
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,520
No.

2172
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,520
Tiara, do you have any last minute stories?

2173
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:51,520
I do not.

2174
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:53,520
So how about last minute thoughts?

2175
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,520
Wait, last thoughts. Loki, any final?

2176
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:58,520
My head hurts. Baby's sleeping right now.

2177
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:00,520
And that means he's going to be up at night.

2178
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:05,520
My head hurts even more knowing that I have to get up at probably 3 in the morning this time.

2179
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,520
Time to break out the Vicodin.

2180
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,520
I can't swallow pills, so that doesn't work.

2181
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:15,520
We'll put it on your pizza.

2182
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,520
I already ate all the pizza.

2183
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,520
Vicopizza.

2184
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,520
And Tiara, for you, any last minute thoughts?

2185
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:25,520
Happy Spocktober, everyone!

2186
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:29,520
That makes me all warm and fuzzy and logical.

2187
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:32,520
And my final thought is...

2188
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:35,520
Taco Salad defeated!

2189
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:37,520
Dun dun dun!

2190
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:39,520
Alright, everybody.

2191
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:45,520
Well, that's been this episode of Orange Lounge Radio's Sans Rob, who never did make an appearance.

2192
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:48,520
How dare he not make an appearance.

2193
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,520
Good night, everybody!

02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:54,520
