[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody, this is episode, what are we on again? 283.

[SPEAKER_00]: 283 of Orange Lounge Radio I'm sorry, 384 I totally threw out a random number there That's kind of funny, huh?

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:54,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, 283 We went back in time Rob's gone and the show has become the TARDIS And we have run back in time You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio I got two of the numbers right, though They were just out of order

5
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:58,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, an OLRG, yes, Spazinator.

00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I am DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob is on a plane.

8
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:04,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead.

9
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Or dead.

10
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:11,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this is Loki, our tech master.

11
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you do any tech stuff lately with us?

12
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:23,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I stole a cord the other day out of the box because I need it for something new in the home, but other than that, no.

13
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Mar and Marvel Video Games

14
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,691
[SPEAKER_09]: So, why don't we go ahead and start with you for how was your gaming week?

15
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,052
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was alright.

16
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:03,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of WoW.

17
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten back into World of Warcraft after not playing for a long time.

18
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And other than that, pretty uneventful.

19
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:17,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some, I like the music games like the Lips and the Beatles rock band, so I did some of those.

20
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:23,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been trying to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years, which came out around this time last year on the Wii.

21
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:41,553
[SPEAKER_07]: and I had started playing it and I just like dropped off the face of the earth and so I started playing it again and now I'm at a point where I'm seriously underleveled for the area I'm at so I'm going to have to go do my least favorite thing which is grinding and leveling up.

22
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:47,918
[SPEAKER_09]: That was always the thing that I could not stand in World of Warcraft just because it seemed really monotonous to me.

23
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:49,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah there is that too.

24
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:51,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiara, Mar and Marvel

25
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:17,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky, and Loki, and DarkSakura.

26
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:18,789
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make you famous.

27
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

28
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

29
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,931
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all sounding very dirty.

30
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: We have ways to make you famous.

31
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:30,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we've got you outnumbered.

32
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:31,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It's estrogen time.

33
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dun-da-dun!

34
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,019
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always estrogen time here with Robs.

35
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,420
[SPEAKER_09]: He's gonna go back and edit this and go, what?

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it's the truth.

37
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:46,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well then, Loki, how was your gaming week?

38
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:53,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I didn't play a whole lot, but I did play some stuff on the iPod and

39
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, a lot of it was just disappointing because I go on these binges where I buy a lot of junk.

40
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:07,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not even necessarily buy a lot of junk, but I download a lot of apps and that includes a lot of games, especially stuff that's on sale.

41
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:16,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went ahead and I downloaded, because it was free, Duke Nukem 3D for the iPod or iPhone or whatever.

42
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,112
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is I deleted it almost immediately because the controls in it really suck.

43
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:29,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's Duke Nukem 3D and it's pretty awesome, but it's just the controls really suck, so what's the point?

44
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, more Plants vs. Zombies.

45
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:33,556
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.

46
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:42,119
[SPEAKER_00]: I also played a little bit of the newly released Bit.Trip beat on the iPod, and...

47
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:53,742
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't like about that game, and it was kind of the same way when it was on the Wii, where everything, you had to kind of tilt the controller to move your paddle up and down.

48
00:04:54,142 --> 00:05:01,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you had to tilt the iPod to move your paddle up and down, and I really think it would have been a lot better if you could just use the touchscreen to move your finger up and down the screen.

49
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:05,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a lot more accurate, and it can ramp up the difficulty or something like that, because...

50
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:06,606
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

51
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:27,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta admit, that game was actually kind of fun.

52
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of reminds me of the old iToyPlay games.

53
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may be thinking, oh, iToyPlay, that's going to be crap.

54
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:43,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, what's kind of cool about it is the fact that with the camera now and the motion controllers, you can actually do a lot of the augmented reality stuff.

55
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, most of the games actually in that use augmented reality controls.

56
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have your...

57
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:52,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

58
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:16,505
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a little, I guess, round in the game where it kind of switches up games really quick, kind of like WarioWare.

59
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually quite fun.

60
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:23,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might actually check out the full version of that if, you know, it would be a good party game or something.

61
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:26,009
[SPEAKER_00]: That and, of course, more sports champions.

62
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Play a little bit of that demo as well.

63
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I still haven't actually gone out to buy any full version move games yet because I just don't...

64
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:35,513
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura,

65
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead Rising 2, Halo Reach

66
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:10,872
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

67
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:41,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow, that hurt!

68
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this one part right before you go to fight, was it Ridley or one of the... Craig.

69
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:51,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Craig, sorry.

70
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:51,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig.

71
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:52,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

72
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:54,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking of school.

73
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:54,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig.

74
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:55,475
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Craig.

75
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig, that's the wrong game.

76
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,477
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which we did play.

77
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:00,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know it is.

78
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:01,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Which we did play.

79
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,019
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll get to that next.

80
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,303
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's this one part where this person's like dead and covered in bugs and the bugs fly off and Rob's like, LOL, you're dead.

81
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:11,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I thought was funny.

82
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:19,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Rob left and we played Turtles in Time on the SNES and we beat the game because Dan and I are an awesome team.

83
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So Shredder did not dine on turtle soup?

84
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,354
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but he kept talking about it.

85
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, dude, don't you have any original lines or something?

86
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:40,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yesterday I went to play, just because we had to go ahead and go buy this really crappy arcade, I stopped to play Parapara Paradise, which is the first Mix Plus.

87
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:42,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was pretty fun.

88
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:47,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually remembered how to do three of them off the top of my head and did a decent job and

89
00:08:49,241 --> 00:09:18,651
[SPEAKER_09]: of course I had four songs to play so I just redid Night of Fire because Night of Fire is fun and then came home and I've played some Sims and mostly it's just been little bits of gaming except for Tuesday night because I've had school work and other stuff to do so that's been my gaming week more eventful than usual but not as not really all that busy my gaming week will be busier soon once Fable 3 comes out because I totally pre-ordered that this weekend ooh

90
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to yell at the dog?

91
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Already for Dance Masters when it comes out since you've been playing some Parapara.

92
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,504
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that game really is anyways.

93
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:29,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not Dance Masters.

94
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:34,527
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is Dance Masters.

95
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance Masters, yeah.

96
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:35,507
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

97
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's Dance Central as the other one.

98
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if there's going to be actual Parapara in it.

99
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

100
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,550
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the moves are.

101
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,451
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Parapara.

102
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:46,132
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Night of Fire on there and it's the exact same thing.

103
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm totally getting this.

104
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, we're getting this.

105
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:50,352
[SPEAKER_00]: He's over at my desk.

106
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,113
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get the Kinect, though, and that's expensive.

107
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:52,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true.

108
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:53,753
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am getting that.

109
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:57,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually probably will pick up this game just for fun, because it's funny.

110
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan's over there saying that he's sure that we'll have it.

111
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:17,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So as for some general housekeeping, like we've been mentioning, Rob is on a giant cylinder defying the laws of gravity, although he is making good use of the laws of propulsion and aerodynamics.

112
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So, way to go, Rob.

113
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,401
[SPEAKER_09]: He's probably up there asleep or playing his Game Boy or something.

114
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:28,503
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said, Rob will probably not be here the entire episode.

115
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if he's here, it will be towards the end.

116
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not making any promises.

117
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:37,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Also... Which is why we're going to do this episode really quick so that it doesn't happen.

118
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,848
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do have the lovely Tiara with us tonight.

119
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:46,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is always welcome to be on the show if she ever gets in town again.

120
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

121
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta save up some vacation time.

122
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:59,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that being said, why don't we hop right into the news headfirst and get ready for some decontamination afterwards.

123
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:00,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

124
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:07,931
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big news this week, of course, Nintendo had their own little press conference not to be outdone by Tokyo Game Show.

125
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:11,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, everything Nintendo was covered by.

126
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:12,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch, we're Nintendo.

127
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:13,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

128
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,016
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do what they want.

129
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:17,778
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not coming to your conference.

130
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,779
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own conference.

131
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:20,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't come.

132
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So they talked, of course, the 3DS, because that's going to be the big release for them next year.

133
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:28,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of details coming out about it.

134
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:36,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is going to be coming out in February for a lot of money.

135
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:42,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to exactly be that expensive when it comes out over here.

136
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:46,474
[SPEAKER_00]: But over there, it is quite expensive.

137
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:50,136
[SPEAKER_00]: 25,000 yen, which is the equivalent of about 300 USD.

138
00:11:52,478 --> 00:12:14,495
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll be out in aqua blue and cosmos black so that's interesting February 26, 2011 is the actual date they're saying that the estimates in the other regions it's supposed to come out around before the end of the first quarter so probably during their fiscal year

139
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:38,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so anyways, so that's, uh, coming out then, and some other details, of course, um, came out about it as well, since, you know, they covered everything Uh, what it'll actually come with when you buy it, it's gonna have, of course, uh, the AC adapter, but what's kinda neat, though, is it has a charging stand Um, so you don't have to buy one of those third-party things, you just slap it right in there

140
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, when it's sitting in the charging stand, it kind of looks like a little puppy.

141
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:45,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of weird with the two cameras on there.

142
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:46,744
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cute little puppy.

143
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is cute.

144
00:12:48,885 --> 00:13:00,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the touch pen and a 2GB SD card, as well as six augmented reality cards, as well as instruction booklets and all that fun stuff.

145
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,710
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess...

146
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,713
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually going to be a built-in augmented reality game that you can play using the 3DS cameras.

147
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be kind of neat.

148
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if PictoChat's still in there, because that'd be fun.

149
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, other fun stuff that's going to be available.

150
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,741
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to, of course, download games to the console as well.

151
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:27,825
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have the ability to import games that you've downloaded from your DSi or DSi XL into the 3DS.

152
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:50,625
[SPEAKER_00]: also they're going to have a brand new virtual console that's going to cover Game Boy and Game Boy Color games so that'll be out there at some point and other fun things of course they're going to be having a web browser that actually works this time it's not just some cheap ass web browser that they're going to

153
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Tackon later on.

154
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:55,186
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually going to have flash support in it, I believe.

155
00:13:56,146 --> 00:14:07,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to also have kind of a tag mode as well where you can walk around and it'll automatically exchange data with other machines and you won't have to just manually turn it on.

156
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:16,870
[SPEAKER_00]: And some other things that they're talking about with that is possibly doing firmware updates using that tag mode.

157
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a way to

158
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everybody's not pirating.

159
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:30,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I was reading about that, but it also seems to me that all it would take would be one simple hardware hack.

160
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:32,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could just also turn it off.

161
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,139
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really worked well for the PSP.

162
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:45,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, they don't have any sort of tag mode with the PSP, but you can always turn that stuff off.

163
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:55,106
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to turn it off, say, if you're playing at home, because that's going to use up a lot of your battery just with the Wi-Fi on all the time.

164
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:56,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

165
00:14:57,228 --> 00:15:00,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so that's what's coming out at least for the 3DS stuff.

166
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a big list of games that they were talking about.

167
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything that you can imagine.

168
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they even had video of a bunch of different things.

169
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:14,100
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Zelda remakes, Mario Kart looks awesome.

170
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,463
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more games we'll be talking about a little bit later, but very exciting stuff.

171
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:26,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now you were saying earlier when Bobby called us that you expected to have a lower price point.

172
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:27,646
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

173
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:04,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we'll just have to wait and see when more information comes out about that stuff.

174
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:08,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we get closer to the launch, it'll be here before you know it.

175
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:09,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Reckon so.

176
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:11,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Tiara, do you have any news for us?

177
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

178
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you like blue hedgehogs, because... They're crunchy.

179
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:18,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

180
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:19,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, what?

181
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:19,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

182
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 is coming out this month.

183
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:31,393
[SPEAKER_07]: and there are going to be a lot of different release dates for different platforms.

184
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:38,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out on October 7th for iPhone and iPod Touch through the iTunes App Store.

185
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,542
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also get it through the Wii Shop channel on October 11th for 1500 Wii Points.

186
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:49,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox Live Arcade, it'll be available October 13th for 1200 Microsoft Points or $15.00.

187
00:16:53,311 --> 00:17:02,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And on October 12th, you can get it on the PlayStation Network for about 13 euros or 10 pounds, which I believe is something like a million dollars US or 15.

188
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:06,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 14.99 actually, but our exchange rate kind of sucks.

189
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:09,267
[SPEAKER_09]: That's putting it mildly.

190
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:15,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually watching a video of Sonic 4 in action, and it looks like it's a lot of fun.

191
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:20,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the updated look to it, but still the cool 2D style play.

192
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:21,497
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks fun.

193
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:22,478
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta be honest.

194
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:23,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this.

195
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:24,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played it.

196
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it.

197
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,001
[SPEAKER_00]: No way!

198
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that might be a good thing for people that like Sonic.

199
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:54,778
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of the same, but I thought it was terrible.

200
00:17:55,438 --> 00:18:01,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's my opinion, but this is coming from someone that doesn't really care for Sonic the Hedgehog.

201
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:06,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one thing, now, I did watch someone play through the minecart level, and it looks incredibly annoying.

202
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:12,452
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I do like the little air dashes in there, where you can target the enemies and dash at them.

203
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:14,634
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my favorite thing in Sonic Adventure.

204
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm glad that's in there.

205
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that seems to me like it's enough of an innovation.

206
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

207
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:24,463
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what it is when it comes out for those of us who don't already have it.

208
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:31,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think the appeal of stuff like this is definitely that it's like the old Sonic games.

209
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:35,731
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's still 2D and it's still, I mean, the graphics are a bit shinier, but it's got that

210
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:40,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Big nostalgia factor for people who are like, like, I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog as a kid.

211
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:45,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, oh, wow, Sonic, I want to play this just to kind of relive those memories.

212
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:47,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of it here with me.

213
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:51,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if they don't, you know, don't change what's not broken, right?

214
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:52,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

215
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:52,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

216
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:59,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other news, oh, Bungie, they've done it again.

217
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:07,290
[SPEAKER_09]: They have banned 15,000 Halo Reach cheaters and are still looking for more to ban.

218
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Not technically cheating.

219
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:12,295
[SPEAKER_00]: They just found a glitch in the game and exploited it.

220
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:13,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, my story, dude.

221
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:15,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

222
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,803
[SPEAKER_09]: What they did, it was called network manipulation.

223
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:20,624
[SPEAKER_09]: They...

224
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:35,253
[SPEAKER_09]: were going in, they found an exploit in the challenge, in one of the challenge levels where you could complete it 20 and more times and then keep disconnecting yourself.

225
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:41,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I like as the bungee rep said, intentional network manipulation to make it sound like it was something other than pulling out the cord.

226
00:19:43,800 --> 00:20:12,667
[SPEAKER_09]: so they were able to find every one of these so they've just gone and done a blanket ban and what happened with the ban itself is that they've actually banned them for 24 hours and removed all of the credits that they earned and so they won't be able to get any more TigerClaw in chat points out that it's still cheating if you exploit a glitch which I think is true I agree

227
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

228
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,517
[SPEAKER_00]: HaloMakers, patch your damn game and fix it.

229
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:56,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are.

230
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:01,951
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't really anything I don't think that affected a lot of people.

231
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:05,978
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just credits to buy crap for your characters.

232
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even see what the big deal is.

233
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:40,255
[SPEAKER_09]: it's getting free credits to get free stuff in the end but then again, I can see it both ways they're especially trying to maintain some level of fairness in the game and definitely replayability the more you play it, the more you have to earn the points the proper way but one thing I would like to point out is that Halo Reach earned $200 million in its first 24 hours so that's the biggest Xbox game ever

234
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:41,952
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft

235
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:01,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

236
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:03,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Bungie's not the only people banning.

237
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:04,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Blizzard's doing it too.

238
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:05,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

239
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:09,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard hit up 5,000 StarCraft II cheaters.

240
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:18,787
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually, for people who hacked and modded their game, they were, they've been permanently banned.

241
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:25,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think they're still on the hunt for more people, but for right now, nope, sorry.

242
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,492
[SPEAKER_09]: You cheat, you lose, bye.

243
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks, bye.

244
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:29,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Flush.

245
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: They're getting serious on it.

246
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:34,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

247
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:47,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally only a week away of its release, NBA Elite 11, the reboot, if you will, of the NBA Live franchise, has been delayed to 2011.

248
00:22:49,433 --> 00:23:01,278
[SPEAKER_00]: With it, of course, was the opportunity to get a free copy of NBA Jam, which was only going to be available originally through the purchase of NBA Elite 11, at least if you wanted it on PS3 or Xbox 360.

249
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:19,341
[SPEAKER_00]: of course they haven't announced when they're going to ship it yet but apparently they're going to be shipping NBA Jam as a standalone product on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in time for the holidays and they haven't said exactly when

250
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:21,143
[SPEAKER_00]: and DarkSakura.

251
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:57,001
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny because that just makes NBA 2K11 the only choice for basketball, at least in October.

252
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go outside and play some real basketball.

253
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:02,083
[SPEAKER_07]: That would work too.

254
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:03,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying.

255
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,386
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but then they'll fall and skin their knees.

256
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:21,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually kind of good at basketball, but I'm very klutzy, so I always am jamming a finger or getting hit in the face with a basketball or something.

257
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:27,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, the video game versions are very much safer than actual real life sports.

258
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,635
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not NBA jamming your finger?

259
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:33,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I dig NBA Jam.

260
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:39,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably a game I'd be interested in at least versus NBA Elite.

261
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:47,108
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to ask yourself, Elite 11 must have been really fucked up if they got to delay it to next year.

262
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, was there some serious problems with that game?

263
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:56,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, no one seems to be really kind of asking them, so why was the game delayed anyways?

264
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:00,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Licensed NBA star here wanted more money for said likeness.

265
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:08,872
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a rumor, though, that it was done because there was somebody, I guess, that was selling a disc on eBay for the PlayStation 3 version.

266
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:10,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that was a demo disc or what.

267
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:15,377
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least there was some sort of disc pressed for NBA Elite 11.

268
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:18,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

269
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,691
[SPEAKER_00]: No pun intended For the record mine was fully intended

270
00:25:58,402 --> 00:25:58,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

271
00:25:58,882 --> 00:26:01,062
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, looking forward to NBA Jam.

272
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:02,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope there's lots of presidents in there.

273
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope Clinton's in there.

274
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:05,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Obama.

275
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:05,763
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be funny.

276
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:10,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'd be cool if you could play as Sarah, what's her face?

277
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:10,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Sarah Palin?

278
00:26:11,024 --> 00:26:12,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

279
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:13,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd usually try to put her out of my head.

280
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:19,746
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, I'm just picturing now like specialized quotes for different political figures.

281
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be funny.

282
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:22,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Like hers would be, Hey, I can see Russia from up there.

283
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:25,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see Russia from the court.

284
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,331
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, moving on.

285
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

286
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:42,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Since Loki was talking about the 3DS release details, that wasn't all that was talked about during this whole Nintendo conference.

287
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:50,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Mistwalker's last story was actually given a release date, and it's going to be out on January 27th.

288
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:59,684
[SPEAKER_07]: But not only that, there's going to be a couple of Wii sequels that they announced at the Nintendo conference.

289
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:04,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And one is for the Game Boy Advance slash DS.

290
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's Rhythm Heaven.

291
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually did not like that game.

292
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:12,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the first Rhythm Heaven, and yeah, I thought it kind of sucked.

293
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:13,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It did.

294
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:14,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

295
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:18,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know why that's exciting news, but it's there, you know.

296
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:18,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

297
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:27,697
[SPEAKER_07]: and the other one is a sequel to the Zero series which is known here as Fatal Frame.

298
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, Fatal Frame is awesome.

299
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:31,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of a cool game.

300
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,541
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more exciting than Rhythm Heaven, I think.

301
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:37,643
[SPEAKER_09]: The creep factor is definitely with that one.

302
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:39,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

303
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you... Am I going to pick up Fatal Frame?

304
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:44,267
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

305
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:45,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to.

306
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:46,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I am.

307
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,240
[SPEAKER_00]: They already had a Fatal Frame game over here.

308
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I just... I don't really care.

309
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,021
[SPEAKER_00]: It was alright.

310
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I still need to buy Cho Aniki.

311
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has nothing to do with Fatal Frame.

312
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you need to buy that.

313
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:01,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

314
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:04,805
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not that good.

315
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:06,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, come on.

316
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:08,967
[SPEAKER_09]: It's muscle-bound men flying around shooting things.

317
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:11,207
[SPEAKER_00]: My mistake.

318
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that must be awesome then.

319
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:15,099
[SPEAKER_09]: It is awesome.

320
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:16,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's laughable and awesome.

321
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:18,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.

322
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

323
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:25,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, moving on to another front, PC gaming.

324
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:32,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been speculated that the PC gaming market is on a serious decline.

325
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, we've seen a lot of it.

326
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:39,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the major franchises just haven't been there or have been turning towards the consoles.

327
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:42,241
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

328
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:06,658
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft2

329
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,155
[SPEAKER_09]: These are actually pulling in a lot more of the money.

330
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Now other titles that are contributing to this too is definitely The Sims 3 because they keep bringing out more and more expansions to that.

331
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:36,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Steam has the right idea with bringing out more and more PC games.

332
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:42,631
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as those in particular, they are exclusively PC developed.

333
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:46,735
[SPEAKER_09]: They're ones that are definitely trying to keep that whole element of gaming alive.

334
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:49,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you think that they're going to be enough to keep it going?

335
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:55,542
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if PC gaming is really dead.

336
00:29:55,602 --> 00:29:58,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just... Well, it didn't say dead, just on the decline.

337
00:29:59,068 --> 00:29:59,749
[SPEAKER_00]: On the decline?

338
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if that's true.

339
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:01,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

340
00:30:03,044 --> 00:30:07,207
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, I know digital distribution seems to work the best on PC.

341
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:19,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think... I mean, it's definitely easier sometimes on consoles because you don't have to worry about having the specs to play a game.

342
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,757
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it works or it doesn't.

343
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

344
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I agree with the statement that it's... I mean, I'm sure it helped because they're big selling games, but...

345
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:39,915
[SPEAKER_00]: There will always be something else that comes out that will be a big selling game in the PC world.

346
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:46,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Civ V got a 91 on Metacritic, which is pretty nice.

347
00:30:48,923 --> 00:31:04,029
[SPEAKER_09]: and Starcraft 2 was a 3 million 3 million copies have been sold already so that's pretty crazy and it got a 93 on Metacritic so I don't know I don't

348
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:15,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in some respects, if you look at it in a financial sense, as far as games that come out that just aren't selling very well, then I think that that's where the decline can be seen.

349
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:21,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily in the people that enjoy the gaming themselves, but just in the games that have come out and how well they sell.

350
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:24,643
[SPEAKER_09]: But these two have clearly turned that around, if that was the case.

351
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:25,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

352
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, we've got our MMOs.

353
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:29,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Always going to be addicts.

354
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:30,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Tara?

355
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:31,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

356
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:32,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

357
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:38,860
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, there are some MMOs that I can't play because I am on a Mac.

358
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Trek Online is completely out for me.

359
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:48,083
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend who also owns a Mac has StarCraft II and he has incredible problems with it.

360
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:50,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not as stable.

361
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:57,667
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, it's harder to play quote-unquote PC games because I don't own a PC, I own a Mac.

362
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:03,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, Steam, though, does have a Mac client now with a good number of games.

363
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:03,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

364
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:08,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true, and I actually have downloaded a couple of games through Steam.

365
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:26,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, actually, you know, that has opened up the door to me to buy more games, but it's just a lot more difficult, especially if you don't, you know, if you want to go out and you just want to play a game right away and it's not available, it's like, well, I guess I'll just get the console version then.

366
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma is suggesting desktop parallels.

367
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:41,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like Windows and I don't want to put Boot Camp or anything else on my Mac to run Windows in order to play games.

368
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:47,639
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about what it's going to be like when I have my full Linux box.

369
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:55,881
[SPEAKER_09]: One cool thing about Linux though is that it will run multiple environments fairly smoothly if you have the computer with the processing power for it.

370
00:32:57,996 --> 00:33:02,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that Linux users probably have the best of all those worlds.

371
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:04,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree with that.

372
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Linux is a good OS and it's

373
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:10,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty stable, and it's better than Windows.

374
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:11,784
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I can say about that.

375
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:18,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Linux Mint now is in its final production version, so that's pretty cool.

376
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:20,667
[SPEAKER_09]: But this isn't Linux Chat.

377
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:22,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not?

378
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:22,907
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

379
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:26,868
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Orange Foodio, where I'm enjoying a delicious taco salad.

380
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Nom nom nom.

381
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:34,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that we've had our mention of food and Linux, how about some release dates?

382
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:39,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel sick since we were talking about food and Linux, mainly just about Linux.

383
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:44,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a sandwich and I thought it would be good, but it's not.

384
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:52,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently this local grocery store over here, Rayleigh's, they have these mega subs now and they have like you can put two different meats and stuff on it.

385
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I just get like a turkey and cheese and stuff.

386
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:57,538
[SPEAKER_00]: But I figured, hey, two different meats, so I better pick two different meats.

387
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different cheeses, I guess I better pick two different cheeses.

388
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:04,259
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have like a turkey, cheddar, provolone, and salami sandwich.

389
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as good as I would have hoped.

390
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,681
[SPEAKER_00]: The salami's too sweet.

391
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:12,922
[SPEAKER_00]: My mic is steady.

392
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:14,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you were cutting out just a little bit.

393
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:15,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you give me the crappy mic?

394
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I didn't give you the crappy mic.

395
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.

396
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of stuff coming out this week, of course.

397
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:39,003
[SPEAKER_00]: The delay of FIFA Soccer 2011 on the Wii.

398
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:44,124
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out a week later than the rest, so poor, poor Wii people had to wait an additional week.

399
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:48,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Pokemon Ranger Guardian Signs on the Nintendo DS.

400
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:51,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, Pokemon!

401
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Pokemans, let us show you them.

402
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollywood Squares on the Nintendo Wii.

403
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because those games never get old.

404
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:03,095
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sports Collection from Ubisoft.

405
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we get a more generic name for that?

406
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:10,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, that's just some sports games, I guess, on the DS.

407
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:14,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants to be a millionaire on the Wii and DS?

408
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Regis is still in that.

409
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:24,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Enslaved Odyssey to the West coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 this week.

410
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,970
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a pretty awesome action RPG.

411
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Lilith's Pet Shop.

412
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:31,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Got lots of games for that.

413
00:35:32,512 --> 00:35:37,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Lilith's Pet Shop, Biggest Stars Blue, Biggest Stars Pink, and Biggest Stars Purple.

414
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:39,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And... Yeah.

415
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta purchase all three, I guess.

416
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:44,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're that awesome.

417
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:49,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait till you start buying blues clues and all the kid titles for your little boy when he's older.

418
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no.

419
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:54,492
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, they don't make those on DS.

420
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:57,173
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just Dora or Go Diego Go.

421
00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:00,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, uh, Niha, uh, Kylan.

422
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:04,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I will not be buying that crap.

423
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:09,239
[SPEAKER_00]: He will have more sophisticated tastes than that.

424
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:10,139

00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,081
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, I want the Dora to explore a game.

00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:14,221
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you want some Mario Kart.

427
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:15,042
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

428
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go, you shoot the hooker.

429
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:23,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I can mod a game of Grand Theft Auto that's not as violent.

430
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that ability.

435
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:48,122
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the, I guess, karaoke revolution of the rap world.

436
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:52,405
[SPEAKER_00]: and it must be hardcore because it's got Def Jam in front of it.

[SPEAKER_00]: And it's neither of those two.

452
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,881
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another puppy game where you raise puppies and do stuff.

453
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:54,462
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't you love puppies, Loki?

454
00:37:54,562 --> 00:37:55,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppies are great!

455
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:59,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Puppies are fine, but I'm not going to buy another game with puppies in it.

456
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the first time.

00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:06,870
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vampire adventure game.

00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay!

461
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably one of those hidden picture games, and I guess that's fine.

462
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:20,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapala Pro Bass Fishing 2010, the bundles version of that, with your wireless fishing rod, so you can...

[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been out.

469
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:33,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to even mention that again.

470
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:36,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

471
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:40,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Final Fantasy The Four Heroes of Light on Nintendo DS.

472
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:41,950
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a pretty good release.

473
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.

474
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:45,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with Ranma.

475
00:38:45,753 --> 00:38:47,074
[SPEAKER_09]: He says fuck all these puppy games.

476
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:48,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a kitty game, damn it.

477
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:50,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, listen.

478
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,218
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to have kitty games coming out.

479
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:55,280
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I know there's one coming out.

480
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,723
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have to live with the puppy game for right now.

481
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:00,404
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a monkey game?

482
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:02,547
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already had a monkey game.

483
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,128
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a ferret game too.

484
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:05,810
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a Pets Monkeys game.

485
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,234
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's two Pets Monkeys games and they were terrible.

486
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,357
[SPEAKER_00]: You dressed up monkeys in little outfits and stuff.

487
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,599
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.

488
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,721
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like the most amazing thing ever.

489
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:17,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I only remember what

490
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:34,228
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some TV show where there's these people that couldn't have children or something they're really old people and they ended up dressing up monkeys like children and would take them out in like baby carriages and stuff like that it's very very disturbing and you can still get that game so that you know alright Tiara we need to go get pets monkeys

491
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:36,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I agree with that statement.

492
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:37,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Dress up our monkeys.

493
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:37,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

494
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,821

[SPEAKER_00]: Pro Stroke.

496
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:44,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Pro Stroke, yes.

497
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,225
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not just an amateur stroke.

498
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:48,727
[SPEAKER_00]: He can stroke it like a pro.

499
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:50,769
[SPEAKER_00]: That is coming out on PlayStation 3.

500
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,632
[SPEAKER_00]: It does support the PlayStation Move for one-to-one stroking.

501
00:39:55,813 --> 00:40:08,523
[SPEAKER_00]: and then this is I think a leftover from last week because oops prank party still still hasn't come out yet thank you Hudson for delaying that another week so I have to mention it for you free advertising there

502
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,652
[SPEAKER_09]: More Bomberman, Hudson, do you hear me?

503
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,073
[SPEAKER_09]: More Bomberman.

504
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:15,496
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new Bomberman game coming to the Xbox Live Arcade at some point.

505
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:16,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Bomberman.

506
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:18,198

00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:26,844
[SPEAKER_00]: From Coco Interactive, it's another casual game, Jewel Master Cradle of Athena.

508
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:28,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a crap what it's about?

509
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:31,027
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a jewel game that you match three.

510
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,388
[SPEAKER_00]: NBA Jam coming out on the Wii.

511
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:42,111
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, you get it before the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions because it was actually supposed to come out standalone on the Wii.

512
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:47,893
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this fancy stuff because your game sucks so you have to delay it and that kind of fun stuff.

513
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:54,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be it for this week.

514
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:56,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, disappointing.

515
00:40:56,577 --> 00:40:59,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of pets games.

516
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it needs more monkeys.

517
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:02,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely more monkeys.

518
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:07,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, there are no monkeys being released in Japan this week either.

519
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:20,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is Enslaved Odyssey to the West on both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, as well as F1 2010 on both of those consoles.

520
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And Red Dead Redemption and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 are both out on the 360 and the PSP as well this week.

523
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:42,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard Macross.

524
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:43,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

525
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Macross F, to be precise.

526
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,401
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from the new anime, Frontier.

527
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:50,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

528
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:50,601

531
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:09,885
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be something with an airport in it, I assume.

532
00:42:11,185 --> 00:42:15,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Kana Imoto is coming out, as well as the limited edition version.

535
00:42:33,871 --> 00:42:35,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fun.

536
00:42:35,092 --> 00:42:36,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Kingdom Hearts.

537
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:36,674

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,482

549
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be it for the UK.

550
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:55,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

551
00:43:55,917 --> 00:44:06,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one game that's not coming out this week, or even when it was intentionally going to come out back in April of 2011, Gears of War 3 has been delayed to the fourth quarter.

552
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:08,449
[SPEAKER_00]: No reason why.

553
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:14,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's just to add extra polish, or because Microsoft realized, hey, we don't have a good fourth quarter game, so...

554
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:44,035
[SPEAKER_00]: it will not be coming out when it's intended but you know what there's plenty of games coming out in April and hell I wouldn't want to take any more time away from Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so I'm fine with that delay I definitely I think I could just totally ignore any Gears of War for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 because that game is full of the awesome intensive characters I want to play

555
00:44:44,733 --> 00:45:11,154
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah uh MVC3 yes Gears of War 3 uh probably not because I haven't played Gears of War 1 or 2 just saying yeah I don't know I think I I'm most excited for playing as uh X-23 and Deadpool oh I don't know about Deadpool but well yeah Deadpool in video games is kind of cool because he like he's aware that he's a video game character and he has all the

556
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:12,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Deadpool is self-aware now

557
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,146
[SPEAKER_07]: is Beyond Good and Evil.

558
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:43,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys remember that game?

559
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:43,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

560
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:48,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good game and it's actually getting an HD re-release.

561
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:56,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ubisoft is going to be re-releasing the game in high definition and they haven't said when but sometime in 2011.

562
00:45:58,016 --> 00:45:59,797
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like it will be a treat.

563
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:01,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes indeed.

564
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:02,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very excited about that.

565
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I really loved that game.

566
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good game.

567
00:46:07,082 --> 00:46:08,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Well now it's time...

568
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:13,067
[SPEAKER_09]: For the classic game of the week.

569
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:20,732
[SPEAKER_09]: And because I do this, it's kind of weird for me to have to manipulate the music and everything at the same time.

570
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:22,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm actually just going to stop that.

571
00:46:24,774 --> 00:46:27,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't have Rob's mad skills to do them all at the same time.

572
00:46:28,357 --> 00:46:34,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will instead start off with a little bit of music, and I'd like to see how many people can guess what it is.

573
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:35,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Just by the opening.

574
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:36,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Presented by Sega.

575
00:46:39,912 --> 00:46:41,533
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be clue enough.

576
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:50,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the game of the week is Samba de Amigo.

577
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:53,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

578
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:53,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Party!

579
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:57,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a special love of Samba de Amigo.

580
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:03,011
[SPEAKER_09]: This music is just so perky.

581
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:07,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like shaking my butt or some maracas or maybe the microphone like a maraca.

582
00:47:08,923 --> 00:47:09,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Or all three of those.

583
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:14,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I will do them all at the same time, which makes it really bad for radio.

584
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:23,737
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate, as we've been talking about maracas, yes, you use maracas as your controllers, and they have these little sensors on the bottom.

585
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And what you do is you have to hit these little...

586
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:31,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

587
00:48:00,484 --> 00:48:02,326
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

588
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:24,225
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

589
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:50,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Sticky Man, Stickly Man comes up on the screen, which we all know Stickly Man from his next job working for Homestar Runner.

590
00:48:52,367 --> 00:49:00,652
[SPEAKER_09]: But he poses, and you have to match that pose by holding each maraca at the right position as indicated on the screen.

591
00:49:01,092 --> 00:49:01,553
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

592
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:32,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, in the Japanese version, it's called Ichi ni Sanba, which is a funny pun in Japanese, because it's one, two, three, but san, ba, yeah, anyway.

593
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:43,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's party mode and battle, where you can play versus couples game, there's a couples game version, which in Japan is called Love Love, where you play through the song to see how compatible you are.

594
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:46,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, um, in, uh,

595
00:49:47,523 --> 00:50:07,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Later versions, in version 2000, there's different things to play in there, like hustle mode, where you have to follow the dots and shake the maracas the right way, but you have to do things in these really weird poses, and you're actually moving the full 360 rotation around, so it's kind of interesting.

596
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:13,921
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also different versions out that have extra songs in there.

597
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:15,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Version 2000, Amiga, Tambourine

598
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:57,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Different Sega games, like for downloadables you had the theme from Afterburners, you had Burning Hearts from Burning Rangers, which I love You also have the Rent-A-Hero theme, which is incredibly funny, stuff from Nights, stuff from Sonic Adventure, Jet Set Radio, Daytona USA, Outrun, Fantasy Zone, the Opa Opa theme is in there

599
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:05,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic CD, the Japanese opening song is in there, Super Sonic Racing from Sonic R, and just a bunch of cool stuff.

600
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:11,058
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the songs in the game, definitely some people might recognize Mambo No.

601
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:12,219
[SPEAKER_09]: 5 and Mexican Flyer.

602
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyone who played Space Channel 5 and watched Swing Girls should know that song anyway.

603
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:23,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Oyakumova by Santana, Papa Loves Mambo is in there.

604
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:29,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, also SOS The Tiger Took My Family by Dr. Bombay is in there, which has nothing to do with Latin music.

605
00:51:31,016 --> 00:51:32,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet is still awesome.

606
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:32,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

607
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:41,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, one of my favorite things to play in there was, um, actually, uh, The Cup of Life is in there.

608
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:42,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was funny.

609
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:46,490
[SPEAKER_09]: And the stupid catch-up song is in there, which I always avoided.

610
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And Highway to Hell is in there.

611
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:49,913
[SPEAKER_09]: In the Wii version, anyway.

612
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:50,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

613
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:53,492
[SPEAKER_07]: That has a lot to do with Latin music.

614
00:51:53,993 --> 00:51:57,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to play the combination of Highway to Hell and...

615
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:02,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Tub Thumping, which is also in all of the versions.

616
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:05,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really fun.

617
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:10,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the Wii version did come out, but it didn't get very, very good ratings.

618
00:52:12,778 --> 00:52:14,918
[SPEAKER_09]: It has some extra stuff in there.

619
00:52:14,938 --> 00:52:19,380
[SPEAKER_09]: It has Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet and Mambo Mambo and I Want Candy.

620
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got other characters in there, such as Sonic and Ulala.

621
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:26,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

622
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:32,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can, it will use your little me's and put some right by your score.

623
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:38,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And it changes the different expressions that are used based on your performance in the game.

624
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:43,739
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a successor out that not many people know about.

625
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:44,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually played it.

626
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:56,063
[SPEAKER_09]: that's called Shakuto Tambourine which is played just like Samba de Amigo except you use a tambourine controller and it's all J-pop music.

627
00:52:57,103 --> 00:53:11,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a version of Samba de Amigo kinda that was the eye toy version for Sega Superstars where it used the eye toy to hold where your hands were instead of the sensors like the maracas used.

628
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:15,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, Shakuto Tambourine is actually really fun and very hard.

629
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:16,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

630
00:53:17,148 --> 00:53:17,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Very hard.

631
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:25,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you've only got one tambourine, and you have to do these little swiping moves over your head and shake the tambourine at the same time, and it's kind of a pain in the butt.

632
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:26,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, you've got characters.

633
00:53:26,994 --> 00:53:32,718
[SPEAKER_09]: You have Amigo, who we've mentioned is a monkey, and Amiga, who is also a monkey.

634
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:33,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

635
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:38,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have Linda, who is the samba school dancer that wears the butterfly costume.

636
00:53:39,823 --> 00:53:42,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bingo and Bongo, they're bears that play the bongos.

637
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:45,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Rio is a cat person who's like a cat and a jaguar.

638
00:53:46,447 --> 00:54:15,787
[SPEAKER_09]: he carries a rose and a horn there's Chumba and Wamba who play the mandolin and the conga drums and they're named after Chumba Wamba and Mr. Pose who is also known as Stickly Man and that is the game that is Samba de Amigo which I personally think the Dreamcast ones are the best but that would be me so anybody else enjoy Samba de Amigo

639
00:54:16,778 --> 00:54:19,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody Amigo is awesome.

640
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:34,505
[SPEAKER_07]: The way that you describe the characters just now, it makes me think of old Disney cartoons like DuckTales and Tailspin, where it's a town full of weird animals doing stuff that people usually do.

641
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:40,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like Somebody Amigo belongs in the Disney kind of world.

642
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:44,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess so.

643
00:54:46,465 --> 00:54:52,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe they've got their own, like, Amigaville, where they all hang out and drink Nescafe.

644
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,874
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good, I used to play Samba de Amigo a lot, like,

645
00:54:57,372 --> 00:54:58,552
[SPEAKER_07]: A million years ago.

646
00:54:58,853 --> 00:54:59,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a long time ago.

647
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:00,773
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good game, though.

648
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:01,193
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

649
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:02,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was fantastic.

650
00:55:02,054 --> 00:55:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's like my old New Year's parties that we used to have over here were always... I mean, rock bands pretty much replaced just about everything music-related, but would always break out DDR and Samba de Amigo and pretty soon would just be drunk in Samba de Amigo, surrounded by lots of beer, and people would fall over, and I would tell them not to break my maracas.

651
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:51,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I still have my maracas and I still I should dust them off and play them soon you should well we are now though sadly at the end of part A but this means we get to go into part B yay so everyone stay tuned we are going to go to a little break and we will hear you when we we will talk to you when we get back you will hear us when we get back I can't hear them

652
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:53,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, no.

653
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:54,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

654
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:04,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to part B of episode 4384.

655
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:36,777
[SPEAKER_09]: 384 episode yes of Orange Lounge Radio I am DarkSakura this is Loki and joining us is Mar and Marvel also known as or known in real life as Tiara I just told them your secret identity oh no it's like you unmasked me in front of millions and millions of people now I'm going to have to make a deal with the devil and have my entire history changed so that nobody knows who I am

656
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:38,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Except really the Illuminati's behind it.

657
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:39,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

658
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:40,243
Yeah.

659
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:43,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So welcome back.

660
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:51,616
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's another reference to perhaps a different podcast that Tara and I do.

661
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:53,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps.

662
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:54,540
[SPEAKER_09]: With another friend of ours.

663
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:55,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

664
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is also an Orange Lounge listener.

665
00:56:58,218 --> 00:57:00,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So, welcome back to the show, as I said.

666
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:08,386
[SPEAKER_09]: We have got some rapid fire news coming up and tweeter topics, because they're tweety and gooden.

667
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:12,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're all good, then Tara might do it in a porn voice.

668
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

669
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:15,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

670
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:16,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps.

671
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:18,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayhaps?

672
00:57:19,113 --> 00:57:19,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayhaps.

673
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,795
[SPEAKER_09]: We may have a porn voice tonight.

674
00:57:22,136 --> 00:57:22,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha.

675
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:23,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

676
00:57:23,817 --> 00:57:25,138
[SPEAKER_09]: So why don't you get us started, Loki?

677
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:25,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

678
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:32,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we've been begging and pleading for Capcom to listen, and they have Mega Man Legends 3 has been announced.

679
00:57:32,997 --> 00:57:38,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to the 3DS, of course, right now, it's just Project, or Mega Man Legends 3 Project.

680
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:42,280
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a work in progress, I guess.

681
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be coming out at some point, I'm guessing probably next year.

682
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:48,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be kind of cool.

683
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:54,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course, this week, like every other week, Rock Band download content.

684
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:54,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Got lots of it.

685
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:56,369
[SPEAKER_00]: This week we've got REM.

686
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,652
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a pack there, including Driver 8.

687
00:58:01,233 --> 00:58:02,934
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end of the world as we know it.

688
00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:06,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Living Well is the best revenge.

689
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Radio Free Europe, Stand...

690
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:13,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Superman, These Days, and What's the Frequency, Kenneth.

691
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:18,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in fake points.

692
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:22,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can get the pack for $13.49 or $10.80 Microsoft points.

693
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:27,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it's not available for a pack on the WiiWare store.

694
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:32,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the T-Rex pack featuring three songs from them.

695
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:36,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Children of the Revolution, Cosmic Dancer, and Jeepster.

696
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:41,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those available for $2 each or $5.49 for the whole pack.

697
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:43,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that'll be coming this week.

698
00:58:44,558 --> 00:58:46,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And, unfortunately, no standalone songs.

699
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's just those two packs.

700
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:52,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you can purchase a song standalone in there, but nothing additional.

701
00:58:53,829 --> 00:59:04,516
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, there's been some new information coming out about my game of the year next year, Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

702
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:07,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Some gameplay video looked absolutely awesome.

703
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:13,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they had some details regarding the gameplay in case anyone had concerns.

704
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

705
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:56,233
[SPEAKER_00]: and 150 weapons also I believe you can earn different points to increase abilities on your player as well as the weapons that you have there will also be an equivalent to the genocide gun in the game which for those who haven't played Earth Defense Force 2017 the genocide gun is a gun that fires a really big laser blast that blows up a lot of stuff the title itself will also run very smoothly as opposed to the last game that came out

706
00:59:56,753 --> 00:59:57,513
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legendary Infernal Mode

707
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:44,535
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're also going to have a 6 player horde mode which apparently you will be pitted against endless waves of enemies that will attack you relentlessly also a remix mode where random enemies will spawn instead of the normal enemies that appear during the campaign and if you're very interested in checking it out there's some gameplay video on Destructoid and oh my god it looks awesome I was kind of worried though with the developer being the one that did the

708
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:46,815
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

709
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:31,111
[SPEAKER_00]: and um apparently they are pretty good and they'll actually help you out through the game otherwise you can get people to help you out and uh definitely looking forward to this gonna probably pick up about three copies of it so make sure I have one for uh each person to play at my work so yeah check it out and we got any more news Tiara yes we do

710
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:41,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Those of you who have pre-ordered your keyboard bundle for Rock Band 3 on the PS3 may have noticed that it has disappeared from US retail sites.

711
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:50,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's because there is a contract problem where Harmonix cannot sell the PS3 keyboard bundle.

712
01:01:51,594 --> 01:01:54,916
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will have to buy your keyboard for $10 extra.

713
01:01:55,516 --> 01:01:58,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can still buy the bundle on the Xbox 360 and Wii.

714
01:01:59,059 --> 01:01:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's good.

715
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:00,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, because...

716
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:30,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the Xbox 360 and also Konami is releasing an awesome awesome awesome new 3D racing arcade game called Road Fighters and it's got like a cabinet with a steering wheel and it has drop down 3D glasses so that's kind of awesome and you can switch between 2D and 3D by pushing a button and I don't know it seems cool I love arcade games like this I suck at racing games but

717
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:41,538
[SPEAKER_07]: It just looks cool, and 3D is the whole new fad of TV movies and gaming, so it should be interesting, and it does look really cool.

718
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:56,770
[SPEAKER_07]: The glasses look ridiculous, I have to say, but it should be fun, and 3D really, I think, is an excellent element for a racing game, since you are right in there with all the cars and all the excitement.

719
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:58,592
[SPEAKER_09]: The glasses look 80s-tastic.

720
01:02:59,099 --> 01:02:59,620
[SPEAKER_07]: They do.

721
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,600
[SPEAKER_07]: They really do.

722
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's part of the reason it's so awesome.

723
01:03:03,343 --> 01:03:04,123
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

724
01:03:05,925 --> 01:03:15,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 coming out and Street Fighter 4 released lately and things like that, what about Darkstalkers?

725
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:21,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see another game having something to do with Darkstalkers, wouldn't you?

726
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:21,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

727
01:03:21,558 --> 01:03:22,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

728
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:34,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono told Eurogamer that making another game in the series would be his ultimate dream, and it can only happen if fans demand it.

729
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:43,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said that it's all up to the readers to get Inafune-san interested in doing the game.

730
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And according to Ono, it would take one million requests before Inafune says yes.

731
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:49,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

732
01:03:50,983 --> 01:04:05,676
[SPEAKER_07]: unfortunately there haven't been that many requests for the game there have been about 5,000 so only 995,000 more requests for a Darkstalkers game before they will consider making one get on it peeps I'm not going to put my name in there

733
01:04:06,553 --> 01:04:07,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Darkstalkers is awesome.

734
01:04:31,772 --> 01:04:38,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I think that they should know that the interest is out there, and if they made the game, that people would buy it.

735
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:42,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, for them to be like, oh no, you have to ask us for it.

736
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just make the freaking game.

737
01:04:43,802 --> 01:04:45,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you're going to be losing money on it.

738
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,365
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll ask for it with our dollars.

739
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:48,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

740
01:04:48,226 --> 01:04:48,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Or our yen.

741
01:04:49,227 --> 01:04:56,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to put it bluntly, it's like saying, okay, listen, you gotta suck my cock, but you're going to have to beg for it first.

742
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,394
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's...

743
01:04:58,999 --> 01:04:59,839
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way they're putting it.

744
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:02,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's insulting.

745
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:08,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you want to put out a game, put out a good fighting game because people are going to buy any fighting game that you put out.

746
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make people beg for it.

747
01:05:10,963 --> 01:05:15,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We own the recipe for these fantastic lollipops, but a million of you must say that you want our lollipops.

748
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:18,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And by lollipops, we mean cock.

749
01:05:20,947 --> 01:05:24,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to do something that every... Who does not like a good lollipop?

750
01:05:24,468 --> 01:05:24,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, please.

751
01:05:26,707 --> 01:05:28,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Parasite Eve was pretty cool.

752
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:47,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad for a game based off of a book.

753
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:53,055
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're basically just going to be bringing it out.

754
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:55,518
[SPEAKER_09]: They just have to tweak it so that it will be playable.

755
01:05:55,638 --> 01:05:56,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just Parasite Eve.

756
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,700
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Parasite Eve 2.

757
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever see the live action movie?

758
01:06:00,864 --> 01:06:01,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it somewhere.

759
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:02,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't watched it.

760
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been trying to look for the translated version of the book.

761
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:08,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have it on VCD somewhere.

762
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:09,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a VCD of it.

763
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my copy's on a VCD as well.

764
01:06:12,673 --> 01:06:14,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I just sort of, oh, that's cool.

765
01:06:15,295 --> 01:06:16,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, look what else we've got.

766
01:06:16,196 --> 01:06:19,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fuck X. Because I think I got them both at the same time.

767
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,720
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also based off a book.

768
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:22,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

769
01:06:24,643 --> 01:06:39,899
[SPEAKER_09]: and moving forward how about Scott Pilgrim the new download content is going to have for Scott Pilgrim I said Spock Pilgrim Spock Pilgrim I would buy Spock Pilgrim because it is Spocktober you know

770
01:06:40,279 --> 01:06:40,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

771
01:06:41,499 --> 01:06:49,801
[SPEAKER_09]: For Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, The Game, there is going to be new download content to go along with the film's release on DVD and Blu-ray.

772
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:54,782
[SPEAKER_09]: It will have a new playable character, Knives Chow, along with two other modes.

773
01:06:55,442 --> 01:07:00,583
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an arena battle with weapons, kind of a light version of Super Smash Bros.

774
01:07:00,623 --> 01:07:02,563
[SPEAKER_09]: it's described as, and dodgeball.

775
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:05,903
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will be $1.99 on PlayStation Network or 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.

776
01:07:09,684 --> 01:07:33,661
[SPEAKER_09]: and they also are going to fix some of the difficulty balancing to make it the average Joe level more forgiving and get rid of some bugs and do drop in drop out co-op it's only though for offline play only and they're not going to incorporate the online MMO into it so none of that yet

777
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:41,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, speaking of Spock, Star Trek Infinite Space is to be coming out.

778
01:07:41,945 --> 01:07:45,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a free-to-play browser version of the game.

779
01:07:47,328 --> 01:07:49,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mac people can play it.

780
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:50,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

781
01:07:51,111 --> 01:07:52,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will be out in summer of 2011.

782
01:07:53,332 --> 01:08:01,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be published by Gameforge and developed by Keen, who also did What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver.

783
01:08:02,815 --> 01:08:03,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

784
01:08:03,816 --> 01:08:05,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And now this is the part that makes me happy.

785
01:08:05,677 --> 01:08:07,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's set during Deep Space Nine.

786
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

787
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:12,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were going to say Jamie Oliver's in the game, so... No.

788
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:12,962
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.

789
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:14,843
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not special.

790
01:08:15,683 --> 01:08:19,966
[SPEAKER_09]: The only cooking I want is the Klingon chef who plays the violin.

791
01:08:20,766 --> 01:08:21,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

792
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And sings opera.

793
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:24,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Klingon opera is the best.

794
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:25,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

795
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And serves half-dead gach.

796
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:30,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course you will...

797
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:31,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

798
01:08:32,014 --> 01:08:32,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh...

799
01:08:58,578 --> 01:09:04,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not STO, but I like that it's set in the Deep Space Nine universe.

800
01:09:04,103 --> 01:09:08,527
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me particularly happy, because Deep Space Nine was my favorite.

801
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:19,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's, you know, I mean, TNG was going on at the same time as Deep Space Nine, so it's probably going to be more focused towards the war, I'm guessing, with the Jem'Hadar.

802
01:09:19,997 --> 01:09:22,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'll be pretty awesome, because that was really a great arc.

803
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:32,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, and it certainly opened up lots of fantastic characterization for all kinds of people in the series, so I thought it was fantastic.

804
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:41,985
[SPEAKER_09]: So, moving forward, we've had another visitor come into the room who was not supposed to be in the room.

805
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:44,127
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to go find your mommy.

806
01:09:45,067 --> 01:09:45,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Please shut the door.

807
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:48,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Pumpkin.

808
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:50,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

809
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:51,392
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't shut the door.

810
01:09:51,412 --> 01:09:51,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Off with her head!

811
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:55,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was Sophie.

812
01:09:57,251 --> 01:10:00,937
[SPEAKER_09]: That is my cousin-in-law's daughter.

813
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:04,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we have lots of children over right now.

814
01:10:05,245 --> 01:10:07,028
[SPEAKER_07]: She was excited about Star Trek.

815
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:07,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you blame her?

816
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:08,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

817
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:14,995
[SPEAKER_09]: She came in wearing my Indiana Jones hat when we were talking about Star Trek.

818
01:10:15,075 --> 01:10:16,536
[SPEAKER_09]: So, where were we?

819
01:10:16,816 --> 01:10:21,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yes, we were over to Twitter Topics, weren't we?

820
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,681
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we use for Twitter Topics again?

821
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:24,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Journey to Wonderland?

822
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:27,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're using it.

823
01:10:28,784 --> 01:10:29,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Twitter Topic time.

824
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any Twitter topics so we forgot to tell them to send Twitter topics.

825
01:10:38,251 --> 01:10:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not forget.

826
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I told them during the break.

827
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:44,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we told them in the chat room to send the Twitter topics.

828
01:10:44,814 --> 01:10:46,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have some Twitter topics.

829
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:48,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see.

830
01:10:49,236 --> 01:10:58,059
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw305 sent us a story about ex-Nintendo sales chief to lead Kidzania's creation of kid-sized cities.

831
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see what this is about.

832
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I found the right music. ...

833
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:07,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, that sounds more like it.

834
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:08,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can continue.

835
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:17,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Kidzania is creating places for kids to learn about real life jobs and entertain themselves in mini cities with shopping malls.

836
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:23,746
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know, it sounds kind of like some kind of second life type thing.

837
01:11:23,986 --> 01:11:24,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

838
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Second life equals no life.

839
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:28,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

840
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:51,846
[SPEAKER_07]: and TigerClaw305 also sent that the Just Cause film has been optioned and the movie script will be written by Michael Ross and it will be produced by Adrian Ask Korea and that should be kind of cool or probably crappy because video game movies kind of suck.

841
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:55,127
[SPEAKER_00]: And when asked why they decided to make the movie, they said Just Cause.

842
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sure, why not?

843
01:11:58,516 --> 01:11:59,517
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna make it.

844
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:01,438
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reason, yes.

845
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:04,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the record, Shadowrunner says Fallout Children.

846
01:12:07,902 --> 01:12:13,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Jay Jugo says, Hey guys, I like this new way to present a co-host on the show.

847
01:12:13,886 --> 01:12:18,088
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a must-keep, in caps, NEVER FORGET, in hashtag.

848
01:12:18,309 --> 01:12:19,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Never forget.

849
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:20,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

850
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:25,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and Spazinator says, in my porn voice,

851
01:12:26,254 --> 01:12:31,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there's a crap ton of new free vids on the PSN store right now.

852
01:12:31,836 --> 01:12:34,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume that they're also available on XBL, too.

853
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:36,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think about that?

854
01:12:37,339 --> 01:12:39,400
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds hot.

855
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:39,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

856
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw Sentence is another story, but we already talked about it.

857
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:45,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard banning StarCraft II cheaters.

858
01:12:47,603 --> 01:12:47,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

859
01:12:48,645 --> 01:12:50,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Kisuke says, wait, what?

860
01:12:50,486 --> 01:12:52,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Sexual innuendos in Orange Lounge?

861
01:12:52,587 --> 01:12:53,088
[SPEAKER_07]: No way.

862
01:12:53,448 --> 01:12:54,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes way.

863
01:12:54,168 --> 01:12:55,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course way.

864
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:55,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh.

865
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:56,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Lollipops.

866
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Way way.

867
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And Matt Ostro... Okay, yeah, I can't say that.

868
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:08,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt Ostrovsky, sorry if I said that wrong, Matt, sent us a story.

869
01:13:08,777 --> 01:13:10,378
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, his story sounds too good.

870
01:13:10,438 --> 01:13:11,398
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a Skrull.

871
01:13:11,618 --> 01:13:11,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no!

872
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:15,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Yuji Naka wants to work on the Dreamcast 2.

873
01:13:18,072 --> 01:13:18,472
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

874
01:13:18,492 --> 01:13:20,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.

875
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:21,994
[SPEAKER_09]: We can dream, we can dream.

876
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:22,934
[SPEAKER_00]: That is wrong.

877
01:13:22,954 --> 01:13:24,655
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never going to happen.

878
01:13:25,255 --> 01:13:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: We can dream about the Dreamcast.

879
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:31,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor Dreamcast.

880
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:32,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to happen.

881
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:35,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one more person sent a Twitter topic.

882
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:45,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, AlphaKananagram sent us a topic about the Katamari Damacy director and his wife starting a new company called Uvula.

883
01:13:45,645 --> 01:13:46,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Uvula.

884
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:48,429
[SPEAKER_07]: with a Loki website.

885
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:59,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And then rather than focusing solely on game development, the company's About Us page details a focus on music and video games, adding that we want to widen our limit.

886
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:00,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

887
01:14:00,662 --> 01:14:01,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Widen the limit.

888
01:14:02,483 --> 01:14:04,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So what could they do to top Noby Noby Boy?

889
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:06,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

890
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:09,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, I actually still play Noby Noby Boy on my iPhone.

891
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:14,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised by this actually.

892
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,244
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to eventually meet girl.

893
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:24,325
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like I have no brain capacity to think of anything to do so I'm going to play with my little warm person.

894
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:26,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It works.

895
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,446
[SPEAKER_09]: DDRDollarBill says no Dreamcast 2 ever.

896
01:14:29,686 --> 01:14:30,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Alas.

897
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:35,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadness.

898
01:14:35,987 --> 01:14:39,528
[SPEAKER_09]: MesaSuma Shenmue 3 on Dreamcast 2 fall of 20 never ever.

899
01:14:43,154 --> 01:14:43,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

900
01:14:45,516 --> 01:14:48,377
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that will do it for our Twitter topics this week.

901
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:58,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to have your Twitter topics read by Rob when he is back next week, then send your Twitter topics to Rob at OLR on Twitter and he will read them, I'm sure.

902
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:03,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can get Rob, instead of doing a porn voice, he can invite Mr. Spanky.

903
01:15:05,787 --> 01:15:11,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob can do one of his voices, which always sound like Rob with kind of a high-pitched voice.

904
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:17,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So how about we find a few more topics to discuss?

905
01:15:19,952 --> 01:15:20,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose we could.

906
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:23,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of interesting.

907
01:15:23,713 --> 01:15:32,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, of course, it's not unexpected, Sony is going after anything that's possibly going to mod the PlayStation 3.

908
01:15:32,176 --> 01:15:46,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they went after the PS Jailbreak before, and now that that's kind of gone, because there's free versions out there, they're now going after other things, including the PS Groove, the kind of open source...

909
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:57,691
[SPEAKER_00]: PS Freedom, and OpenPS Jailbreak They are aiming for takedowns.

910
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:07,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently the website PSX Scene has found some different things that they've marked out.

911
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:25,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Exhibits and they are trying to basically erase the existence of these, not necessarily the devices, but of these programs because the devices themselves can be practically anything nowadays because they've been adopting the PS Groove to

912
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:28,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Practically everything.

913
01:16:28,723 --> 01:16:42,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from an iPod to a TI-84 to some old ass MP3 players, USB development, cards, just everything.

914
01:16:42,546 --> 01:16:45,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately not PSP because they were unable to port it over to the PSP.

915
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:51,708
[SPEAKER_00]: But your phone, iPhone, Droid, you name it, it can hack the PS3 now.

916
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:57,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mom can hack a PS3.

917
01:16:57,165 --> 01:17:01,287
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to start hack-storing brains because people are always going to think of a way to do it.

918
01:17:02,068 --> 01:17:06,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, you can try to stop people from doing that stuff, but where there's a will, there's a way.

919
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:08,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they want to hack it, they will.

920
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:10,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

921
01:17:13,534 --> 01:17:22,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of hack-storing brains, during the Tokyo Game Show event, Q Entertainment head Tetsuya Mizu

922
01:17:23,427 --> 01:17:29,951
[SPEAKER_07]: and Mizuguchi unveiled the new component of his upcoming rail shooter, Child of Eden.

923
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:34,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wants participation from us.

924
01:17:36,135 --> 01:17:39,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's for part of the game he calls The Journey Project.

925
01:17:40,018 --> 01:17:48,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's seeking to build a collection of player-submitted pictures for inclusion on the last level of the Child of Eden game.

926
01:17:49,442 --> 01:17:54,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Mizuguchi says, In this game, the player's mission is to purify everything, even data.

927
01:17:54,664 --> 01:17:56,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the final stage of the game, you know.

928
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:59,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I need the beauty of memories.

929
01:18:00,187 --> 01:18:06,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So with collected memories of family, friends, and beautiful landscapes, you can get that kind of memory with music.

930
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:07,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It must be real.

931
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:12,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Mizuguchi also added, I want to put everybody's credit at the end of the game.

932
01:18:13,392 --> 01:18:13,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah.

933
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:14,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

934
01:18:15,495 --> 01:18:24,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Ubisoft clarified that images can be submitted to the official Child of Eden website through November 20th and any approved photos will be used in the game.

935
01:18:25,021 --> 01:18:30,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even imagine what's going to be submitted by random people.

936
01:18:32,326 --> 01:18:33,187
[SPEAKER_09]: No butts in the game.

937
01:18:36,309 --> 01:18:37,610
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get a lot of ganguro.

938
01:18:39,611 --> 01:18:40,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Which would be kind of funny.

939
01:18:42,493 --> 01:18:44,054
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is going on out there?

940
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:50,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, the cousins are over and they're having a fun time in the front room.

941
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:51,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy fun time.

942
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:56,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Watching YouTube videos of the guys singing all of the John Williams themes with his own lyrics.

943
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually all about Star Wars.

944
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:02,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

945
01:19:02,413 --> 01:19:03,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, some YouTube thing.

946
01:19:05,092 --> 01:19:27,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So, well, we do have a little bit of other news, at least I do, about Medal of Honor, which for anyone who tuned into Bobby's show earlier, they know this, or if they can read, but they have decided to change the name of the multiplayer faction Taliban to Opposing Force.

947
01:19:28,403 --> 01:19:37,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're doing it, as I said, out of respect for those in the military and for those who have lost family members in the war.

948
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:41,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're trying not to show any disrespect.

949
01:19:41,268 --> 01:19:44,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I sort of have the opinion that they already had this in mind.

950
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:49,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was a ploy to get a little more publicity.

951
01:19:49,091 --> 01:19:49,151
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

952
01:19:53,553 --> 01:20:00,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if they're doing this... I mean, the name Opposing Force is kind of unimaginative.

953
01:20:01,655 --> 01:20:02,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Generic, much?

954
01:20:03,836 --> 01:20:04,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, very generic.

955
01:20:05,836 --> 01:20:11,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, wouldn't Opposing Force all be relative to what force you are opposing?

956
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:14,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They could just call it Bad Guys.

957
01:20:14,658 --> 01:20:16,719
[SPEAKER_07]: They should just... Bad Guys...

958
01:20:18,536 --> 01:20:19,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, the bad guys.

959
01:20:19,936 --> 01:20:21,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it's offensive to people who are bad.

960
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:23,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no!

961
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:24,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah!

962
01:20:25,438 --> 01:20:27,418
[SPEAKER_09]: They should just call it Red Team?

963
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:28,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Dudes.

964
01:20:29,099 --> 01:20:29,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Dudes?

965
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:30,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicks.

966
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,940
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, then that's just sexist right there.

967
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:34,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

968
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I call everyone dudes, so that's not sexist.

969
01:20:37,641 --> 01:20:43,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if you have chicks to find out in there as well, you just can't do that.

970
01:20:43,063 --> 01:20:44,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be dudes and blokes.

971
01:20:45,803 --> 01:20:46,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Blokes.

972
01:20:46,644 --> 01:20:47,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Blokes.

973
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:47,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It works.

974
01:20:48,723 --> 01:20:49,544
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

975
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:11,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I thought we were us.

976
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:12,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm me.

977
01:21:13,366 --> 01:21:14,789
[SPEAKER_09]: It's me versus everybody.

978
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:17,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Die!

979
01:21:18,356 --> 01:21:19,217
[SPEAKER_09]: No, anyway.

980
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty says woot blokes.

981
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:22,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

982
01:21:23,835 --> 01:21:25,337
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

983
01:21:42,713 --> 01:22:03,199
[SPEAKER_00]: and also location tests I guess for XG2 are going to be starting soon as well as Guitar Freak's Drum Mania V7 that's way too many damn games that'll be starting very soon and

984
01:22:05,945 --> 01:22:09,747
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't really said exactly when those location tests are actually going to start.

985
01:22:09,927 --> 01:22:11,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with GB Ripples.

986
01:22:12,388 --> 01:22:17,971
[SPEAKER_00]: That location test, sometime next year, but the only one announced so far is XG2.

987
01:22:20,152 --> 01:22:22,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it called Knit?

988
01:22:23,674 --> 01:22:24,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

989
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does Konami name anything like that?

990
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:29,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a knitting game.

991
01:22:30,977 --> 01:22:31,837
[SPEAKER_07]: But not really.

992
01:22:33,218 --> 01:22:34,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there's Crafting Mama, so...

993
01:22:36,107 --> 01:23:03,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I want Crochet Master Master of Crochet You could call it Check My Hook To a guy who says Fancy Nancy Fancy Nancy Knit for Fancy Nancy Oh dear In other news Yes please Well we all know how

994
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:07,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird and perverted the internets can be.

995
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:18,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And so since the internets is full of weirdos and perverts, you have to take some measures to make sure that LEGO Universe can still be child-friendly.

996
01:23:19,157 --> 01:23:31,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And so NetDevil has recently outlined a couple of measures that they are implementing to help protect the MMO's younger players, since it is targeted towards kids.

997
01:23:32,197 --> 01:24:01,393
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically it includes content moderation which is no surprise to anyone really so you will have to get anything that you make the name will have to be approved before it will go out into the LEGO Universe world and the other part is a LEGO Universe ID which is kind of it actually sounds a lot like Nintendo's friend code system to where you give your LEGO Universe ID to other people outside of the game

998
01:24:01,923 --> 01:24:07,408
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they can see your creations that you've made even before they're approved.

999
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:13,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Protecting the innocent childrens from the weirdos of the internet.

1000
01:24:13,574 --> 01:24:14,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1001
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:16,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And later on they will become the weirdos of the internet.

1002
01:24:17,517 --> 01:24:20,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed, but on their own, not without the perversion of other people.

1003
01:24:21,201 --> 01:24:22,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, no, we can't have that.

1004
01:24:22,722 --> 01:24:23,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the children.

1005
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of the children and how crunchy they are.

1006
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:35,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's time for another special segment of the show that this time I will actually use the correct music for.

1007
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,054
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for the mailbag.

1008
01:24:40,154 --> 01:24:41,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've got the rubber gloves on.

1009
01:24:42,935 --> 01:24:47,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bending its stinky self over and I'm opening the bag and...

1010
01:24:49,383 --> 01:24:56,904
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of... Because Rob hasn't cleaned out the spam filter like he does for me, so there's all kinds of... Read the spam!

1011
01:24:57,244 --> 01:24:59,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, read the spam, because I don't really care.

1012
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,025
[SPEAKER_09]: There's spam in there about Lady Gaga.

1013
01:25:01,045 --> 01:25:03,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have left it in there for Rob, but I won't.

1014
01:25:03,345 --> 01:25:04,706
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so Rob.

1015
01:25:06,706 --> 01:25:07,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob loves Lady Gaga.

1016
01:25:07,966 --> 01:25:10,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I have started appreciating Lady Gaga a little bit.

1017
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:12,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Lady Gaga is stalking me.

1018
01:25:13,227 --> 01:25:13,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1019
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:17,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever since I sang Lady Gaga for karaoke...

1020
01:25:18,138 --> 01:25:21,761
[SPEAKER_07]: One time, now she's following me everywhere and she's like in my head.

1021
01:25:24,262 --> 01:25:30,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Now when you start, you know, busting out the asymmetrical wigs and, you know, dresses of meat.

1022
01:25:31,447 --> 01:25:35,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't look enough like Marilyn Manson to pull off any of Lady Gaga's looks.

1023
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:39,032
[SPEAKER_09]: She was so much prettier before she went, anyway, I'm not going to get into that.

1024
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:40,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, OLR.

1025
01:25:40,713 --> 01:25:44,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I come to Loki with a non-gaming question that I think he'll have a good answer for.

1026
01:25:45,825 --> 01:25:46,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

1027
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:47,566
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1028
01:25:47,906 --> 01:25:51,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I'm a contractor and my cell phone contract is up.

1029
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:52,748
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you recommend for me?

1030
01:25:53,488 --> 01:25:59,410
[SPEAKER_09]: All I want is a family plan with no text, no data, and 1,500 plus minutes of phone a month.

1031
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:00,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I've looked at the big four.

1032
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:04,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know if there's some weird hacker service that I'm unaware of.

1033
01:26:04,652 --> 01:26:06,952
[SPEAKER_09]: At the moment, I'm leaning with T-Mobile because of price.

1034
01:26:07,033 --> 01:26:08,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, can you help a desperate turtle?

1035
01:26:08,993 --> 01:26:11,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

1036
01:26:12,055 --> 01:26:19,647
[SPEAKER_09]: And disclaimer, Orange Jones Radio is not paid by any of the companies that might be mentioned and we should be even if they wanted to pay us.

1037
01:26:20,918 --> 01:26:21,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1038
01:26:21,599 --> 01:26:28,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I have a crap plan that didn't have any of that stuff, and it's actually more expensive than plans to have all that stuff, so go fig there.

1039
01:26:29,705 --> 01:26:30,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have to really kind of shop it.

1040
01:26:31,006 --> 01:26:42,175
[SPEAKER_00]: There's websites and stuff that you can actually put what you need for your plan, and it will kind of shop everybody and tell you what the most affordable plan for you is.

1041
01:26:43,075 --> 01:26:46,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the life of me what that website's called, but I know it's out there.

1042
01:26:47,137 --> 01:26:49,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not Google, it's something else.

1043
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,638
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can do that.

1044
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:59,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning on getting a phone through Virgin Mobile just because they're $25 a month for 300 minutes.

1045
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:02,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I honestly use like 12 minutes a month, if I'm lucky, on my phone.

1046
01:27:04,023 --> 01:27:05,964
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything cheaper than that would be awesome.

1047
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually looking at a prepaid phone.

1048
01:27:09,346 --> 01:27:12,908
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think $25 a month with no contract would not be that bad.

1049
01:27:13,889 --> 01:27:16,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus I can browse the internet on that if I really want to.

1050
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:18,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry I texted you earlier.

1051
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:19,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I should give you a dollar.

1052
01:27:20,213 --> 01:27:20,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.

1053
01:27:20,753 --> 01:27:22,034
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright.

1054
01:27:22,574 --> 01:27:24,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've got some suggestions from the chat room.

1055
01:27:26,216 --> 01:27:28,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator says to quote Monty Python, I hate spam.

1056
01:27:28,838 --> 01:27:29,738
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's wrong.

1057
01:27:29,898 --> 01:27:31,920
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I don't like spam!

1058
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:50,519
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says T-Mobile sucks and suggests Verizon and Ranma suggests go with Sprint, great coverage, dirt cheap Virgin also because they're piggybacking on the Sprint network Spazinator uses Cricket I use AT&T because I have an iPhone

1059
01:27:52,074 --> 01:28:20,676
[SPEAKER_09]: and I basically use everything except the phone to call people I do not call people only if it's necessary because I hate talking on the phone I did it way too long for my job the only people I like talking to on the phone is like my mom because she's funny and frustrating at the same time I'm pretty happy with Verizon myself they're a little bit more expensive though but I get better coverage from them I have no reception for AT&T or Sprint within my house

1060
01:28:21,465 --> 01:28:23,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And I deal with Verizon, so, you know, can't go wrong with that.

1061
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:27,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed that I didn't get as good reception in your house when I visited.

1062
01:28:28,389 --> 01:28:32,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, it's AT&T and Sprint both have really crappy reception inside of my house.

1063
01:28:33,191 --> 01:28:35,572
[SPEAKER_09]: AT&T's pretty good out, at least in Sacramento.

1064
01:28:36,433 --> 01:28:40,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next email comes up from Kamitsuyo.

1065
01:28:40,295 --> 01:28:42,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Hi everyone at OLR.

1066
01:28:42,856 --> 01:28:47,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's time to revisit how Rob is doing on his quest to finish three games this summer.

1067
01:28:47,498 --> 01:28:48,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard any talk of it lately.

1068
01:28:48,839 --> 01:28:50,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering the summer's over, yeah.

1069
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:51,120
[SPEAKER_00]: He failed.

1070
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:09,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1071
01:29:24,918 --> 01:29:32,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, what I'm writing about is an episode at the beginning of the summer when Rob talked about how he never finishes games and was dedicating himself to finish three games this summer.

1072
01:29:33,322 --> 01:29:35,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Haven't heard any progress on this or on the show lately.

1073
01:29:36,283 --> 01:29:40,245
[SPEAKER_09]: He has kind of inspired me to play several games to completion, which I have done several.

1074
01:29:40,345 --> 01:29:45,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Dead Redemption, Final Fantasy XIII, Darksiders, Alan Wake, and currently working on God of War series on PS3.

1075
01:29:46,212 --> 01:29:49,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Just finished the first, along with a slew of 360 arcade games.

1076
01:29:50,493 --> 01:29:51,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Love the show.

1077
01:29:51,153 --> 01:29:51,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep them coming.

1078
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Look forward to the big 10-year anniversary marathon.

1079
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:54,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay black.

1080
01:29:55,114 --> 01:29:55,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Kamitsuyo.

1081
01:29:56,594 --> 01:30:03,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, one of the games that Rob was supposed to finish was Final Fantasy XIII, which is currently sitting in my living room because I'm playing it.

1082
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:09,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I'm also playing the... I'm sitting down with that Avatar game finally, too.

1083
01:30:10,596 --> 01:30:13,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll just have to make RobFest up next week, won't we?

1084
01:30:14,557 --> 01:30:14,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1085
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:14,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1086
01:30:16,022 --> 01:30:16,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And last email.

1087
01:30:17,483 --> 01:30:18,563
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from DarkKisuke.

1088
01:30:19,563 --> 01:30:24,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Just had to note, whatever that Japanese game you brought up on Twitter, I swear it was a fucking hentai.

1089
01:30:24,605 --> 01:30:27,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Go back and listen for yourself and be the judge, XD.

1090
01:30:27,126 --> 01:30:28,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Hail the FSM, DarkKisuke.

1091
01:30:30,668 --> 01:30:31,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it for email.

1092
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:33,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1093
01:30:34,649 --> 01:30:39,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you have any emails you want to send us, it's mailbag at OrangeLodgeRadio.com.

1094
01:30:41,015 --> 01:30:41,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Send it!

1095
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:45,678
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more final stories here.

1096
01:30:45,798 --> 01:30:48,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think you have something that we need to do first.

1097
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, someone just said that the stream went down.

1098
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:55,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't think that it did, did it?

1099
01:30:57,744 --> 01:30:59,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear us, internets?

1100
01:31:03,266 --> 01:31:04,347
[SPEAKER_09]: It says the server's down.

1101
01:31:04,467 --> 01:31:04,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Crap.

1102
01:31:05,087 --> 01:31:05,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1103
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:07,048
[SPEAKER_00]: That's back online.

1104
01:31:07,809 --> 01:31:08,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?

1105
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:08,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1106
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:10,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Shoutcast is saying that it's not.

1107
01:31:11,525 --> 01:31:11,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.

1108
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:12,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1109
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:15,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Who crosses streams?

1110
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:16,229
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.

1111
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:21,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll just let him... Winamp froze, actually.

1112
01:31:22,454 --> 01:31:23,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Winamp froze.

1113
01:31:23,795 --> 01:31:24,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that sucks.

1114
01:31:25,277 --> 01:31:25,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1115
01:31:25,917 --> 01:31:26,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Tara, can you let the chatroom know?

1116
01:31:27,178 --> 01:31:27,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1117
01:31:27,578 --> 01:31:27,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1118
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:30,921
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably want to make sure that Part B saves.

1119
01:31:31,622 --> 01:31:38,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe save it now and we'll continue on with Part 3, if you will.

1120
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:43,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to mark this down.

1121
01:31:43,537 --> 01:31:43,517
36, 45.

1122
01:31:44,477 --> 01:31:47,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, where's my pen?

1123
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:02,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1124
01:32:03,762 --> 01:32:04,142
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

1125
01:32:04,422 --> 01:32:05,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they hearing us now or something?

1126
01:32:06,462 --> 01:32:08,103
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just like Loki's comment.

1127
01:32:08,383 --> 01:32:09,123
[SPEAKER_06]: End scene.

1128
01:32:11,523 --> 01:32:15,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually closing down Winamp.

1129
01:32:15,425 --> 01:32:15,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1130
01:32:15,805 --> 01:32:17,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to reload it.

1131
01:32:24,129 --> 01:32:24,689
Sorry.

1132
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:44,478
[SPEAKER_11]: All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.

1133
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:45,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we are.

1134
01:32:48,001 --> 01:32:49,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1135
01:32:49,082 --> 01:32:49,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1136
01:32:49,662 --> 01:32:51,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to fix this to the right settings.

1137
01:32:51,743 --> 01:32:52,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1138
01:32:52,324 --> 01:32:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: MP3 encoder.

1139
01:32:55,766 --> 01:32:56,546
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell was it?

1140
01:32:56,887 --> 01:32:57,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1141
01:32:57,107 --> 01:32:57,367
[SPEAKER_03]: 44 kilobyte.

1142
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:01,450

[SPEAKER_09]: And DDRDollarBill says, I thought the Daleks were next week.

1145
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:42,620
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.

1146
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:48,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, from what I understand, it went down during mailbag, so we'll make Rob edit it.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so shall we move forward with our little podcast?

1150
01:33:55,344 --> 01:33:55,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1151
01:33:56,804 --> 01:33:58,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, rescue us.

1152
01:34:00,005 --> 01:34:02,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you can't rescue us right now.

1153
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:02,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why?

1154
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:05,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at the use of the week.

1155
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:09,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Just in time for the stream to go down.

1156
01:34:12,059 --> 01:34:12,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is impeccable.

1157
01:34:13,241 --> 01:34:13,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes it is.

1158
01:34:29,545 --> 01:34:40,359
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to the stream for going down while I was busy paying attention to other things and for Rob going to Club 33 without me!

1159
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:41,900
Bitch.

1160
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:43,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

1161
01:34:44,404 --> 01:34:44,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1162
01:34:45,914 --> 01:34:53,499
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did my headache that I've had for two days now, and it just won't go away.

1163
01:34:54,219 --> 01:34:59,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of sleep, really, but I've been trying to get sleep and just can't.

1164
01:35:00,343 --> 01:35:01,403
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a small person.

1165
01:35:01,504 --> 01:35:03,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not even, yeah.

1166
01:35:03,925 --> 01:35:04,525
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit him.

1167
01:35:04,886 --> 01:35:05,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's all him.

1168
01:35:07,346 --> 01:35:10,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's been very tiring to say the least.

1169
01:35:11,267 --> 01:35:22,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, so that's, after that, after the crappy drivers, I literally saw somebody pass somebody on the right within the same lane on my way here.

1170
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:23,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, really?

1171
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:24,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

1172
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:26,030
[SPEAKER_00]: You just did that?

1173
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:31,091
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in that much of a hurry that you need to pass somebody in the same lane on the wrong side?

1174
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:33,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, thank you.

1175
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:34,951
[SPEAKER_00]: And Effie the Scammers.

1176
01:35:35,191 --> 01:35:46,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, by the way, brings us to our favorite, well, my new favorite topic, which is shoutouts to people on AOL Instant Messenger.

1177
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:52,367
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we have somebody that you probably should give a shoutout to and let them know that they should really do the right thing.

1178
01:35:52,907 --> 01:35:54,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And that person would be...

1179
01:35:55,029 --> 01:35:58,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Pimpin Tyler 146 on AOL Instant Messenger.

1180
01:35:59,691 --> 01:36:03,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be posting his name in the chat room and Twitter.

1181
01:36:03,652 --> 01:36:12,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to give him a nice little hi because he is a douchebag that didn't come through on his end of the transactions.

1182
01:36:13,356 --> 01:36:14,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he'd love to hear from all of you.

1183
01:36:19,008 --> 01:36:19,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

1184
01:36:19,928 --> 01:36:20,768
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my work.

1185
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:25,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Because not only am I working my normal shift, which is 9 to 6.

1186
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:25,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.

1187
01:36:26,249 --> 01:36:31,310
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm also now working these extra days where I'm working until midnight or 1am.

1188
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:34,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really messing up my sleep schedule.

1189
01:36:34,611 --> 01:36:37,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't want to pay me overtime.

1190
01:36:38,411 --> 01:36:41,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And on next Sunday, I get to work from 2pm to 2am.

1191
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:44,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really, really sucks.

1192
01:36:44,352 --> 01:36:45,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did not sign on for this.

1193
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:47,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And so F you my work.

1194
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:51,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't they have to pay you overtime if you work more than a certain amount of hours?

1195
01:36:52,077 --> 01:36:53,138
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I'm salary.

1196
01:36:53,798 --> 01:36:54,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that sucks.

1197
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,260
[SPEAKER_07]: But they don't want to give me any incentives either.

1198
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:02,743
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want to do this stuff, and it's like, this is not part of my job description, you know?

1199
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:04,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very upsetting.

1200
01:37:05,244 --> 01:37:06,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that sucks.

1201
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:08,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope there's some improvement soon.

1202
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:23,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now that the FUs are over and we're full of angst that we have now released onto the unsuspecting internet, Loki, do you have another story for us?

1203
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I do.

1204
01:37:27,629 --> 01:37:56,464
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's funny since you mentioned release there is going to be a brand new peripheral coming to the Nintendo Wii Remote unfortunately it is not something that is say approved by Nintendo or even something that you would say use with a Nintendo game we've covered this yes but they finally actually were going to be releasing them now fun

1205
01:37:57,534 --> 01:38:03,211
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are Nintendo Wii remote accessories that are kind of...

1206
01:38:05,697 --> 01:38:07,198
[SPEAKER_00]: They're for dildonics, basically.

1207
01:38:07,418 --> 01:38:11,739
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two different peripherals to use.

1208
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:17,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the main function of this, obviously, is it's actually for chatting over the web.

1209
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:29,164
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using the Wii remotes as kind of a Bluetooth adapter so that these things can vibrate and you can remotely vibrate them across the web using, I guess, different programs.

1210
01:38:30,165 --> 01:38:33,686
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Mojo Weejo is what it's actually called, the company.

1211
01:38:34,726 --> 01:38:56,830
[SPEAKER_00]: and I believe that they said they're going to be supporting a bunch of different chat applications and I'm sure their own chat application as well but it's in the beta stage right now but it'll be available for purchase in time for holiday season 2010 so God I would not want to be part of that beta test

1212
01:38:57,470 --> 01:39:05,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to link a copy of that image in the chat room, but I think it's funny that there's like a whole YouTube video describing how it's supposed to be used.

1213
01:39:06,117 --> 01:39:07,398
[SPEAKER_09]: It's intensely hilarious.

1214
01:39:09,079 --> 01:39:09,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed.

1215
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:10,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1216
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:14,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Intensely hilarious.

1217
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:18,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, even the name is just too ridiculous for me.

1218
01:39:18,787 --> 01:39:19,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Mojo Weejo.

1219
01:39:20,608 --> 01:39:21,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Mojo Weejo.

1220
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:25,372
[SPEAKER_07]: See, even porn voice doesn't make Mojo Weejo sound good.

1221
01:39:25,732 --> 01:39:26,373
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it doesn't.

1222
01:39:27,048 --> 01:39:28,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And your porn voice is excellent.

1223
01:39:29,409 --> 01:39:29,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1224
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:30,550
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1225
01:39:31,991 --> 01:39:34,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, away from the porns.

1226
01:39:36,513 --> 01:39:44,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Former Sega man Yuji Naka is working on an action game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 with Prope.

1227
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:50,941
[SPEAKER_07]: And he hasn't revealed what the game is yet, but he will soon.

1228
01:39:51,582 --> 01:39:53,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So, according to Naka...

1229
01:39:54,844 --> 01:40:03,251
[SPEAKER_07]: They are doing a few quite big action game projects at Prope, but he didn't tell us anything about them.

1230
01:40:04,032 --> 01:40:09,896
[SPEAKER_07]: He did say that a very original action game based in the sky will be revealed within this month.

1231
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:12,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something to look forward to.

1232
01:40:12,979 --> 01:40:14,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it has airships.

1233
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:16,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, airships!

1234
01:40:16,782 --> 01:40:19,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it's going to be Skies of Arcadia.

1235
01:40:20,053 --> 01:40:21,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, maybe.

1236
01:40:21,874 --> 01:40:22,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be.

1237
01:40:23,274 --> 01:40:25,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It's based in the sky, and it involves airships.

1238
01:40:26,335 --> 01:40:26,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

1239
01:40:27,975 --> 01:40:33,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we will know soon, according to Nakasan, right?

1240
01:40:33,857 --> 01:40:34,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, soon.

1241
01:40:34,557 --> 01:40:37,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Within this month, they are going to tell us about his project.

1242
01:40:39,517 --> 01:40:40,218
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1243
01:40:55,616 --> 01:41:21,902
[SPEAKER_09]: if we can get it to work so I'm going to go ahead and make this disclaimer right now because we do have Tiara in through Skype I'm going to try to get these to work as a conference call so we don't have to disconnect on her so I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now and go ahead and make your calls I'm not going to play any music call

1244
01:41:25,918 --> 01:41:26,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes.

1245
01:41:27,239 --> 01:41:28,741
[SPEAKER_09]: This is about we do the waiting game.

1246
01:41:28,821 --> 01:41:29,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Dan.

1247
01:41:31,623 --> 01:41:32,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Riveting.

1248
01:41:33,645 --> 01:41:34,245
[SPEAKER_00]: It is riveting.

1249
01:41:34,265 --> 01:41:36,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got a call.

1250
01:41:36,627 --> 01:41:37,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we got a call.

1251
01:41:37,828 --> 01:41:38,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to answer.

1252
01:41:42,151 --> 01:41:44,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're talking to Orange Lounge Radio.

1253
01:41:44,553 --> 01:41:45,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is this?

1254
01:41:46,175 --> 01:41:47,776
[SPEAKER_12]: This is DJ Blaziken.

1255
01:41:48,256 --> 01:41:49,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, DJ Blaziken.

1256
01:41:49,657 --> 01:41:50,318
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

1257
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:53,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing fine, and I just found...

1258
01:41:54,765 --> 01:42:23,401
[SPEAKER_12]: a solution for all DSI owners that might be listening in I found this out through the internet and through the grace of it because I don't know if any of you guys have had this problem but I have and I'm sure there might be a few of you that might have had this the L and R buttons becoming not able to be fixed when hit and you'd have to end up Kung Fu mashing them in

1259
01:42:24,147 --> 01:42:31,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the thing is, the little gap that lets it go down is basically letting dust in.

1260
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:37,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, best bet, take a little mini vac or whatever you have to suck the dirt out and do exactly that.

1261
01:42:38,517 --> 01:42:42,079
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to... Actually, it's made my DS work again.

1262
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:43,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Fully functional again.

1263
01:42:45,581 --> 01:42:47,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you for sharing the tip with us.

1264
01:42:47,863 --> 01:42:49,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad it's worked for you.

1265
01:42:50,365 --> 01:42:52,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure other people have had similar issues.

1266
01:42:53,680 --> 01:43:12,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and, um, other than that, my original DS, well, the second DS light I've ever owned, started to completely fail on me, and ended up spending, well, going broke, really, on a new DS light, and it was actually the last one in the batch.

1267
01:43:12,545 --> 01:43:21,307
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was well worth it, with Pokemon HeartGold, which is kind of a, I don't know, basically just HeartGold with the crystal

1268
01:43:22,515 --> 01:43:26,920
[SPEAKER_12]: and yellow features sort of slapped into it with new DS graphics.

1269
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:27,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's pretty cool.

1270
01:43:28,021 --> 01:43:31,605
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll tell you what, we're getting other calls in, so I need to go ahead and let you go.

1271
01:43:31,886 --> 01:43:32,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for calling.

1272
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:35,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, I do give it a 10 out of 10.

1273
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:36,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you for calling.

1274
01:43:36,631 --> 01:43:37,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1275
01:43:41,376 --> 01:43:42,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was DS Master.

1276
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:46,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am super professional.

1277
01:43:47,422 --> 01:43:48,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Osfer says I'm super professional.

1278
01:43:48,803 --> 01:43:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make sure that we haven't... I'm going to see if I can't get Marin off of... Are you there?

1279
01:43:59,049 --> 01:43:59,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

1280
01:43:59,849 --> 01:44:02,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so this is what we're going to do now for future calls.

1281
01:44:02,771 --> 01:44:07,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I want people to... I'm going to add the conference.

1282
01:44:07,673 --> 01:44:08,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Aha!

1283
01:44:08,734 --> 01:44:09,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It worked.

1284
01:44:10,095 --> 01:44:11,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, who are we talking to?

1285
01:44:13,717 --> 01:44:14,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Clark.

1286
01:44:14,824 --> 01:44:18,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, hello you across the ocean.

1287
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:20,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Aki Ripper, how are you?

1288
01:44:22,226 --> 01:44:25,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing just fine on this Monday morning.

1289
01:44:26,347 --> 01:44:28,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do have Tara on the line still too.

1290
01:44:28,247 --> 01:44:29,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday morning?

1291
01:44:29,387 --> 01:44:30,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you from the future?

1292
01:44:32,488 --> 01:44:35,028
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I just live in this place called Sweden.

1293
01:44:36,409 --> 01:44:38,729
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the future in Sweden.

1294
01:44:38,929 --> 01:44:40,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, well, what is it?

1295
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:41,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm eight hours ahead of you.

1296
01:44:43,188 --> 01:44:44,749
[SPEAKER_09]: That means you are from the future.

1297
01:44:44,929 --> 01:44:46,109
[SPEAKER_07]: You are from the future.

1298
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,811
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the future like?

1299
01:44:49,951 --> 01:44:50,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it beautiful?

1300
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:52,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there flying cars?

1301
01:44:52,772 --> 01:44:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us, I must know.

1302
01:44:55,153 --> 01:44:56,513
[SPEAKER_10]: No, nothing of that yet.

1303
01:44:57,514 --> 01:44:58,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately.

1304
01:44:59,154 --> 01:45:01,375
[SPEAKER_07]: But since you're in Sweden, you have awesome chocolate, right?

1305
01:45:04,536 --> 01:45:05,316
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't.

1306
01:45:05,517 --> 01:45:06,197
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no.

1307
01:45:06,237 --> 01:45:09,098
[SPEAKER_10]: You're thinking of like Switzerland or Switzerland.

1308
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: What does Sweden have that's awesome?

1309
01:45:12,266 --> 01:45:13,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about Sweden.

1310
01:45:14,728 --> 01:45:16,189
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we have that's awesome?

1311
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:23,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we... Oh, that's like... We have... What do we have?

1312
01:45:23,354 --> 01:45:27,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Well... Damn!

1313
01:45:27,337 --> 01:45:28,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Prostitution?

1314
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:31,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1315
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Cotton hookers!

1316
01:45:34,102 --> 01:45:35,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We have prostitution in Las Vegas.

1317
01:45:35,863 --> 01:45:37,104
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Amsterdam, sorry.

1318
01:45:37,124 --> 01:45:37,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, whatever.

1319
01:45:39,201 --> 01:45:40,762
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, what's on your mind, dude?

1320
01:45:41,883 --> 01:45:44,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, what did I call?

1321
01:45:44,764 --> 01:45:49,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, something of some sort.

1322
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:51,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Crap.

1323
01:45:52,068 --> 01:45:53,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1324
01:45:54,109 --> 01:45:55,490
[SPEAKER_10]: You forgot to talk about something.

1325
01:45:56,771 --> 01:46:00,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Age Ultimate Edition is coming soon.

1326
01:46:03,094 --> 01:46:05,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, somewhere around December or something.

1327
01:46:06,836 --> 01:46:14,422
[SPEAKER_10]: and, well, the funny thing is that I've just been reminded I did buy Dragon Age on launch day and I haven't played it.

1328
01:46:14,782 --> 01:46:24,429
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason I've just been reminded is that I play it on a PC and, funny story is that my computer that I play it on, you can unlock it.

1329
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:36,217
[SPEAKER_10]: You can unlock all the four cores since two of them is disabled by default of sorts and that makes Dragon Age load up pretty fast

1330
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:57,474
[SPEAKER_10]: but then the two cores was really faulty so I had to disable them and then I was like I don't want to play this slow loading game so I'm going to play it when I have a quad core and I still don't have a quad core so I'm just going to wait even more.

1331
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:04,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should just suck it up and play the game, because Dragon Age Origins is an awesome game.

1332
01:47:04,072 --> 01:47:06,873
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best game ever, and you're really missing out.

1333
01:47:07,493 --> 01:47:10,654
[SPEAKER_07]: See, you have Dragon Age Origins in Sweden.

1334
01:47:10,714 --> 01:47:13,095
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you have, but you are neglecting it.

1335
01:47:14,655 --> 01:47:23,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to be honest, I'm playing that thing called Sims 3, and I'm eagerly waiting Nightlife.

1336
01:47:24,269 --> 01:47:25,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's going to be fun.

1337
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:28,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm probably going to get it well after everybody else has had it.

1338
01:47:29,431 --> 01:47:33,732
[SPEAKER_09]: The chat room also would like to inform us that Sweden has IKEA.

1339
01:47:35,352 --> 01:47:36,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1340
01:47:37,073 --> 01:47:43,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but where I live, where I live in Sweden, we don't.

1341
01:47:46,415 --> 01:47:49,816
[SPEAKER_10]: We have it, but I have to go like, well, what is it?

1342
01:47:51,397 --> 01:47:51,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Two

1343
01:47:52,346 --> 01:47:58,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because I'm like one of those, in some way, uneducated bastards that lives in a cave of sorts.

1344
01:48:19,195 --> 01:48:20,776
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay, you're like the rest of us.

1345
01:48:22,978 --> 01:48:29,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Where we live in our caves called our computer rooms and don't come out except when we need to eat and go to the bathroom.

1346
01:48:30,285 --> 01:48:34,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's like one up on this one, too.

1347
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:38,552
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I have a challenge for you.

1348
01:48:39,433 --> 01:48:40,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a challenge for you.

1349
01:48:40,394 --> 01:48:44,177
[SPEAKER_09]: By the end of the month, you must start Dragon Age Origins.

1350
01:48:44,878 --> 01:48:45,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1351
01:48:45,378 --> 01:48:46,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well...

1352
01:48:47,509 --> 01:48:54,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's... That's not... Well, that... Because of the thing, though, in one way, actually, I've been reminded.

1353
01:48:54,611 --> 01:49:07,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I have played it, it's just that... It's just that I want to play the... Well, I have, like, played a few of the origin stories, and then afterwards I just get bored by some strange reason.

1354
01:49:10,095 --> 01:49:11,455
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have gamer ADD.

1355
01:49:13,601 --> 01:49:19,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, and I actually have a real ADD too, so That would contribute.

1356
01:49:19,906 --> 01:49:22,688
[SPEAKER_10]: If we are to go be that way.

1357
01:49:23,769 --> 01:49:24,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That would contribute.

1358
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:28,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Aki Ripper, I appreciate the call.

1359
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:29,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we doing okay without Rob?

1360
01:49:31,735 --> 01:49:33,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're doing just fine.

1361
01:49:34,257 --> 01:49:41,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, well, in some way I would say more of this in the future, please, even though it's like

1362
01:49:41,926 --> 01:49:56,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Rob, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, yeah, that's the way, yeah, something, I don't know, I'm just this worthless foreigner of whatever, I'll just, oh.

1363
01:49:57,413 --> 01:49:59,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you are not a worthless foreigner, we adore you.

1364
01:50:00,114 --> 01:50:03,095
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need to go ahead and let you go, we've got another call coming in, okay?

1365
01:50:03,115 --> 01:50:04,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, later.

1366
01:50:05,256 --> 01:50:05,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

1367
01:50:05,616 --> 01:50:05,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1368
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:09,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, caller.

1369
01:50:10,831 --> 01:50:12,031
[SPEAKER_09]: You are on Orange Jones Radio.

1370
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:12,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Who be thee?

1371
01:50:14,432 --> 01:50:16,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I be DDR Dollar Bill.

1372
01:50:16,553 --> 01:50:16,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

1373
01:50:16,973 --> 01:50:19,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

1374
01:50:19,634 --> 01:50:20,675
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1375
01:50:21,555 --> 01:50:22,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nothing much.

1376
01:50:23,656 --> 01:50:27,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give an update about the PlayStation 3 that I got a couple weeks back.

1377
01:50:29,398 --> 01:50:30,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally purchased it.

1378
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:32,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1379
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:33,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1380
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:34,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats.

1381
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,060
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

1382
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I said congrats.

1383
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:37,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks.

1384
01:50:38,142 --> 01:50:38,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

1385
01:50:38,582 --> 01:50:38,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

1386
01:50:39,443 --> 01:50:43,325
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better to watch DVDs on there, I'll give you that much.

1387
01:50:45,606 --> 01:50:48,367
[SPEAKER_01]: But the move, I didn't like it at all.

1388
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:57,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out that you asked for me, I actually have to be about six feet away from the TV, and unfortunately I don't have that much room in my apartment.

1389
01:50:59,131 --> 01:51:00,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that sucks.

1390
01:51:01,152 --> 01:51:09,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, I mean, I went forward, and it stopped detecting, and I was only, like, maybe four feet away from the screen, and I said, uh, no, this is not gonna work.

1391
01:51:10,576 --> 01:51:13,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any way that you could wall mount, like, a receptor or something?

1392
01:51:15,698 --> 01:51:18,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have, well... I think you should mount it onto your ceiling.

1393
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:23,502
[SPEAKER_07]: That's at least six feet away, right?

1394
01:51:24,682 --> 01:51:26,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to lay down on the floor to do that, though.

1395
01:51:29,386 --> 01:51:31,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be laying on the floor waving my stick.

1396
01:51:31,348 --> 01:51:32,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, that doesn't look right at all.

1397
01:51:33,409 --> 01:51:34,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then.

1398
01:51:36,952 --> 01:51:44,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I just wanted to say that, and I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it for one big reason.

1399
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:48,262
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking batteries on the controllers.

1400
01:51:50,304 --> 01:51:53,827
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such a joy just to actually plug in the controllers, get it going.

1401
01:51:53,847 --> 01:51:55,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we got multiplayer.

1402
01:51:56,489 --> 01:51:57,430
[SPEAKER_09]: That's always a plus.

1403
01:51:58,673 --> 01:52:05,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so... So let's... Hold on a second.

1404
01:52:06,259 --> 01:52:06,719
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

1405
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:07,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1406
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:08,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing myself repeat myself.

1407
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:10,342
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to do what to yourself?

1408
01:52:11,103 --> 01:52:13,284
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was hearing my voice coming in an echo.

1409
01:52:13,344 --> 01:52:15,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, why?

1410
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:19,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you've got your... You're too close to your speakers or something to that effect?

1411
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:22,051
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be at least six feet away.

1412
01:52:23,612 --> 01:52:26,174
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be at least six feet away to enjoy this podcast.

1413
01:52:28,843 --> 01:52:33,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the biggest hits so far in the household is LittleBigPlanet and ModNation Racers.

1414
01:52:35,864 --> 01:52:37,345
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you like ModNation Racers?

1415
01:52:37,405 --> 01:52:38,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been meaning to play that.

1416
01:52:39,965 --> 01:52:42,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, before I go into it, I'm going to say this again.

1417
01:52:42,786 --> 01:52:44,166
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the sole disclaimer.

1418
01:52:45,766 --> 01:52:50,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Super Mario Kart on the SNES was the biggest piece of shit that ever existed.

1419
01:52:51,847 --> 01:52:52,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1420
01:52:52,507 --> 01:52:55,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the controls sucked horribly and the perspective just...

1421
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:56,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, exactly.

1422
01:52:56,439 --> 01:52:57,320
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.

1423
01:53:21,775 --> 01:53:26,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when they can't just design their own characters and cars and even tracks.

1424
01:53:27,423 --> 01:53:32,850
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start doing the tracks, that's going to be a lot more fun because we can just recreate anything we want.

1425
01:53:33,611 --> 01:53:37,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially around New York, we got no shortage of tracks to replicate.

1426
01:53:38,496 --> 01:53:39,817
[SPEAKER_09]: So I need to ask you something.

1427
01:53:40,357 --> 01:53:40,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1428
01:53:40,937 --> 01:53:42,198
[SPEAKER_09]: As a dude, I have to ask you this.

1429
01:53:42,919 --> 01:53:43,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1430
01:53:43,219 --> 01:53:46,021
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it about being able to customize your characters?

1431
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:47,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that a lot like Barbie dolls for dudes?

1432
01:53:50,184 --> 01:53:50,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, okay.

1433
01:53:51,945 --> 01:53:57,389
[SPEAKER_09]: When we have all these wrestling games and my husband would like try to, you know, make the wrestlers look all cool and stuff.

1434
01:53:57,409 --> 01:53:58,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, dude, it's like you're playing dress up.

1435
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:00,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.

1436
01:54:02,313 --> 01:54:04,374
[SPEAKER_01]: In essence, you're halfway right.

1437
01:54:04,454 --> 01:54:07,474
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of like doing Barbie, but... But it's manly Barbie.

1438
01:54:07,874 --> 01:54:09,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And wrestling is like soap opera for dudes.

1439
01:54:10,395 --> 01:54:10,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

1440
01:54:12,355 --> 01:54:13,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no disagreements.

1441
01:54:14,636 --> 01:54:17,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he got her drunk and they got married!

1442
01:54:17,397 --> 01:54:17,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no!

1443
01:54:18,917 --> 01:54:19,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Triple H. Sorry.

1444
01:54:23,858 --> 01:54:26,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm coming back from the dead again.

1445
01:54:28,459 --> 01:54:31,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, now it's the underbiker.

1446
01:54:32,723 --> 01:54:36,065
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he's back to Undertaker, like the dead guy again.

1447
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:37,666
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a biker for a while though.

1448
01:54:37,686 --> 01:54:39,527
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, but the underbiker was.

1449
01:54:40,007 --> 01:54:41,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're on wrestling, sorry.

1450
01:54:42,468 --> 01:54:43,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alright, he lost tonight anyway.

1451
01:54:44,549 --> 01:54:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh really?

1452
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:47,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been that long, I'm like, I don't know who any of these people are anymore.

1453
01:54:47,891 --> 01:54:50,832
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrible that they wrote that into the script, that he would lose.

1454
01:54:52,293 --> 01:54:54,314
[SPEAKER_01]: He lost by getting hit with the urn.

1455
01:54:55,494 --> 01:54:55,715
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1456
01:54:55,915 --> 01:54:59,056
[SPEAKER_01]: They wrote that all back in there, they're going way back.

1457
01:54:59,496 --> 01:54:59,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1458
01:54:59,877 --> 01:55:00,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1459
01:55:01,075 --> 01:55:02,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1460
01:55:02,716 --> 01:55:03,396
[SPEAKER_01]: They went backwards.

1461
01:55:03,977 --> 01:55:14,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Given that I remember playing Wrestlemania in the arcade and you could choose The Undertaker when I was a kid Oh yeah.

1462
01:55:14,202 --> 01:55:15,623
[SPEAKER_09]: The underbiker needs to retire.

1463
01:55:17,544 --> 01:55:19,245
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not the only one who's saying that.

1464
01:55:19,545 --> 01:55:19,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1465
01:55:20,714 --> 01:55:30,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyway, so now, thank you for clearing this up for me, because I've always wondered if it's just the same sort of little giddy joy in making them look pretty.

1466
01:55:30,997 --> 01:55:32,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, pretty, pretty ponies.

1467
01:55:33,138 --> 01:55:42,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to add to it, in the wrestling games, it's also a joy now where you can actually create your own finishers, so now it's not just, ooh, they look pretty, like, ooh, I can kick your ass pretty!

1468
01:55:43,662 --> 01:55:47,303
[SPEAKER_09]: That's... I've never heard someone say, I can kick your ass pretty.

1469
01:55:47,323 --> 01:55:47,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha!

1470
01:55:49,289 --> 01:55:50,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just going with the thought.

1471
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:54,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever play WrestleMania 2000 on Nintendo 64?

1472
01:55:55,435 --> 01:55:55,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1473
01:55:56,616 --> 01:56:03,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I played that, and I made this guy who was part of D-Generation X, and we would just put him on watch mode, and he beat everybody.

1474
01:56:04,043 --> 01:56:06,285
[SPEAKER_09]: He won every belt, including the women's belt.

1475
01:56:09,908 --> 01:56:10,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh.

1476
01:56:10,508 --> 01:56:11,389
[SPEAKER_01]: When the AI was actually that

1477
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:13,461
[SPEAKER_01]: easily manipulative.

1478
01:56:13,761 --> 01:56:14,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

1479
01:56:14,562 --> 01:56:15,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1480
01:56:15,622 --> 01:56:17,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, this isn't wrestling chat.

1481
01:56:17,544 --> 01:56:18,925
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Orange Ons Radio.

1482
01:56:19,666 --> 01:56:20,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.

1483
01:56:20,126 --> 01:56:23,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games, but... Are you sure about that?

1484
01:56:23,629 --> 01:56:24,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes.

1485
01:56:25,030 --> 01:56:27,912
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about food in Part A. We did already get our food out of our system.

1486
01:56:28,392 --> 01:56:29,433
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds bad.

1487
01:56:29,493 --> 01:56:31,995
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more like what we do during the break is get our food out of our system.

1488
01:56:33,256 --> 01:56:34,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, I got my pizza here to eat too.

1489
01:56:35,898 --> 01:56:37,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we let you get to your pizza?

1490
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,741
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of pizza do you have?

1491
01:56:41,163 --> 01:56:41,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

1492
01:56:41,969 --> 01:57:06,710
[SPEAKER_09]: alright, you too bye pizza and wrestling so reminds me of my early years with my husband how romantic well, you know how we got engaged was watching UHF and drinking Manischewitz wine, which should have set a precedence there yep so, do we have any other callers?

1493
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:10,073
[SPEAKER_09]: because if you don't, I'm closing the line and you're all SOL

1494
01:57:12,252 --> 01:57:14,793
[SPEAKER_09]: 5, 4... Misty is supposed to call.

1495
01:57:14,873 --> 01:57:15,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Call, Misty!

1496
01:57:15,873 --> 01:57:17,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty, call!

1497

[SPEAKER_09]: You must call.

[SPEAKER_09]: Are you on?

1502
01:57:26,276 --> 01:57:27,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, she's sneaky.

1503
01:57:30,677 --> 01:57:33,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not see her in the list of people who are on the lines.

1504
01:57:34,518 --> 01:57:34,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww.

1505
01:57:37,092 --> 01:57:37,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.

1506
01:57:38,012 --> 01:57:39,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1507
01:57:40,573 --> 01:57:42,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, I do not see a Misty.

[SPEAKER_09]: Call us!

01:57:45,874 --> 01:57:46,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Call us.

01:57:47,795 --> 01:57:50,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got another one in, but it's not Misty.

1511
01:57:50,375 --> 01:57:51,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see who this is.

1512
01:57:52,056 --> 01:57:55,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Jones Radio.

1513
01:57:55,436 --> 01:57:57,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you whoring yourself out today?

1514
01:57:58,470 --> 01:58:01,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm whoring myself to whoever has the highest amount of money for me.

1515
01:58:02,013 --> 01:58:02,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh baby, oh baby.

1516
01:58:03,474 --> 01:58:04,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Ranma.

1517
01:58:04,935 --> 01:58:06,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, hey, what's up?

1518
01:58:06,457 --> 01:58:07,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Ranchan.

1519
01:58:08,518 --> 01:58:10,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranchan, oh hi.

1520
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:12,562
[SPEAKER_09]: We see what you did there.

1521
01:58:13,743 --> 01:58:14,463
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I do try.

1522
01:58:15,524 --> 01:58:16,765
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing today?

1523
01:58:17,826 --> 01:58:18,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I am doing good.

1524
01:58:18,927 --> 01:58:27,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you believe I just finished editing my podcast to get it and it's... Huh?

1525
01:58:31,013 --> 01:58:32,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we lose him?

1526
01:58:32,474 --> 01:58:32,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, here we go.

1527
01:58:33,035 --> 01:58:33,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

1528
01:58:33,715 --> 01:58:34,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I hit the mute button by accident.

1529
01:58:35,116 --> 01:58:35,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1530
01:58:36,116 --> 01:58:38,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, don't hit the mute button.

1531
01:58:38,698 --> 01:58:44,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Never hit the mute button, because then you'll end up sounding like this while you're trying to talk.

1532
01:58:44,681 --> 01:58:46,242
[SPEAKER_11]: And right, we can't have that now.

1533
01:58:46,622 --> 01:58:49,144
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1534
01:58:49,284 --> 01:58:59,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Just finished editing our podcast, and it just went upline, and I'm looking at all the emails of all the gaming demos that's going on at New York Anime Festival slash Comic Con this weekend.

1535
01:59:00,459 --> 01:59:01,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, do tell.

1536
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:07,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, first email I got is from the people behind DC Universe.

1537
01:59:08,041 --> 01:59:11,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh!

1538
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:12,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is also interesting.

1539
01:59:14,323 --> 01:59:17,644
[SPEAKER_11]: The Marvel Super Hero MMO will be playable as well.

1540
01:59:18,204 --> 01:59:19,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1541
01:59:20,345 --> 01:59:21,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at a graphic of it.

1542
01:59:22,025 --> 01:59:25,326
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty much the Marvel Super Hero Squad online game.

1543
01:59:25,366 --> 01:59:26,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks interesting.

1544
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:27,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, that's cute.

1545
01:59:27,747 --> 01:59:28,707
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be adorable.

1546
01:59:29,909 --> 01:59:30,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.

1547
01:59:31,070 --> 01:59:35,091
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also got an email from Sega, so they'll be showing off the new Thor game.

1548
01:59:36,012 --> 01:59:36,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, cool.

1549
01:59:38,273 --> 01:59:43,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am curious about DC Online, because this will be the second time I've ever played a PS3 in my entire life.

1550
01:59:45,656 --> 01:59:45,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1551
01:59:46,696 --> 01:59:51,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, first time I played it was at some gaming con, and I played it on Street Fighter 4.

1552
01:59:52,059 --> 01:59:53,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Only thing that annoyed me was the load time.

1553
01:59:54,179 --> 01:59:54,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1554
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:57,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I much prefer that on Xbox.

1555
01:59:59,312 --> 02:00:05,956
[SPEAKER_11]: As do I. It's funny though, I only bought Street Fighter 4 only because I know the person that does the voice of Ryu in the game.

1556
02:00:06,276 --> 02:00:06,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1557
02:00:07,177 --> 02:00:07,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1558
02:00:09,318 --> 02:00:09,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is it?

1559
02:00:09,738 --> 02:00:11,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what other stuff has he done that I would recognize?

1560
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:17,722
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Kyle Hebert, and did you ever watch the dub Dragon Ball Z?

1561
02:00:18,423 --> 02:00:20,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried not to, but I have it sometimes.

1562
02:00:21,164 --> 02:00:22,685
[SPEAKER_11]: He did the voice of Adult Gohan.

1563
02:00:23,506 --> 02:00:23,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1564
02:00:24,066 --> 02:00:24,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1565
02:00:25,007 --> 02:00:26,467
[SPEAKER_09]: He was actually one of the ones that wasn't annoying.

1566
02:00:27,228 --> 02:00:27,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1567
02:00:29,746 --> 02:00:33,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Of the very few that were not annoying, he was one of them.

1568
02:00:36,109 --> 02:00:42,412
[SPEAKER_11]: He wasn't the older adult Gohan when Viz and Pioneer dubbed it.

1569
02:00:42,452 --> 02:00:45,393
[SPEAKER_11]: He was part of the Funimation cast when they redubbed the series.

1570
02:00:46,753 --> 02:00:53,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I pieced it together when you said it because I remembered Ryu's English voice.

1571
02:00:54,269 --> 02:00:59,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and that and I don't remember how many episodes they dubbed before Funimation took over.

1572
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:01,451
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like a giant blur to me.

1573
02:01:02,931 --> 02:01:04,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Ball Z is a giant blur to me.

1574
02:01:05,692 --> 02:01:15,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, with Dragon Ball Kai, which is supposed to be more of the manga-based version, or I like to call it Dragon Ball Z Kai, less filler reps, still tastes great.

1575
02:01:17,595 --> 02:01:18,375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

1576
02:01:18,795 --> 02:01:22,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So the battle with Cell only takes like five episodes instead of 73 episodes?

1577
02:01:23,578 --> 02:01:24,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

1578
02:01:24,959 --> 02:01:25,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.

1579
02:01:27,021 --> 02:01:37,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, when I had my fan subs of the Cell episodes, they were seriously over four VHS tapes at whatever the long play was.

1580
02:01:38,391 --> 02:01:38,791
[SPEAKER_09]: SLP.

1581
02:01:38,871 --> 02:01:39,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1582
02:01:40,753 --> 02:01:41,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1583
02:01:42,034 --> 02:01:42,814
[SPEAKER_09]: That's way too much.

1584
02:01:43,095 --> 02:01:43,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1585
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:50,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the first time I watched the Phantom of Dragon Ball Z. Me and my cousin were at his grandmother's house watching it.

1586
02:01:50,552 --> 02:01:59,676
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was third or fourth generation VHS tape because as we're watching it, the video quality was so bad that it would just flip to a blue screen like every three minutes.

1587
02:01:59,716 --> 02:02:05,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're just sitting there glued to the TV watching every single minute of it.

1588
02:02:05,498 --> 02:02:08,039
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like my first experience is watching Ranma 1.5.

1589
02:02:11,532 --> 02:02:16,493
[SPEAKER_09]: My first copies were fansubs from the Ranma Project, about four or five generations old.

1590
02:02:19,434 --> 02:02:26,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember there was this comic book shop I used to periodically hang out at, and they actually had the fansub copies.

1591
02:02:27,836 --> 02:02:29,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is, I didn't like the price he was offering.

1592
02:02:29,696 --> 02:02:32,337
[SPEAKER_11]: He was like, two episodes for like 20 bucks.

1593
02:02:32,417 --> 02:02:34,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, no, that can stay on the shelf.

1594
02:02:34,437 --> 02:02:37,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the old days when he traded fansubs.

1595
02:02:39,238 --> 02:02:40,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

1596
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:41,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, memories.

1597
02:02:42,619 --> 02:02:44,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have all my fansubs in storage.

1598
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:46,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we download them off the internet.

1599
02:02:48,881 --> 02:02:50,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Shh, shh, don't say that.

1600
02:02:50,621 --> 02:02:52,422
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not supposed to.

1601
02:02:53,202 --> 02:02:55,143
[SPEAKER_09]: How else am I going to get my Digimon fix?

1602
02:02:56,503 --> 02:03:00,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, did you know they actually... I'm watching the new series of Digimon.

1603
02:03:00,244 --> 02:03:01,544
[SPEAKER_11]: ...refansubbed on Digimon?

1604
02:03:02,405 --> 02:03:07,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, don't... Don't get me started.

1605
02:03:08,908 --> 02:03:09,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So how about more video games?

1606
02:03:09,909 --> 02:03:11,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like Butterfly, the opening theme.

1607
02:03:12,351 --> 02:03:13,692
[SPEAKER_09]: How about more video games?

1608
02:03:13,732 --> 02:03:14,592
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is going to be up there?

1609
02:03:15,813 --> 02:03:16,774
[SPEAKER_11]: That's basically it.

1610
02:03:16,794 --> 02:03:18,715
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all the information I have here.

1611
02:03:20,476 --> 02:03:24,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, there's another company called Game Tech that's supposed to be there.

1612
02:03:24,619 --> 02:03:30,923
[SPEAKER_11]: They're probably doing these little flash-based games or something like that.

1613
02:03:30,983 --> 02:03:31,984
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my assumption.

1614
02:03:32,164 --> 02:03:34,826
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not saying too much about it.

1615
02:03:35,026 --> 02:03:38,128
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be the Kentia Hall of your convention.

1616
02:03:41,277 --> 02:03:53,063
[SPEAKER_11]: To be perfectly honest, the Kensha Hall of Comic Con is like the little room in the back where it's open gaming and then people try to get up on stage and make fools of themselves.

1617
02:03:53,803 --> 02:03:57,405
[SPEAKER_09]: That's always the best part of cons is people making fools of themselves in costume.

1618
02:03:59,726 --> 02:04:01,107
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll definitely be in costume.

1619
02:04:01,567 --> 02:04:09,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of in costume, I am looking for pieces for a River Song cosplay from

1620
02:04:09,813 --> 02:04:19,798
[SPEAKER_07]: The end of the last Doctor Who series, so if you know somebody who can help me out with finding some pieces for that, I would be much appreciative.

1621
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:29,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm probably the minority in my group that does not watch Doctor Who, only because I have so much stuff on my plate to watch I have no time for it.

1622
02:04:29,623 --> 02:04:30,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1623
02:04:32,324 --> 02:04:36,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, if it helps, I watched some of the original stuff from the 60s and the 70s.

1624
02:04:37,226 --> 02:04:38,267
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I grew up on.

1625
02:04:39,684 --> 02:04:40,585
[SPEAKER_11]: on public access.

1626
02:04:40,765 --> 02:04:42,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.

1627
02:04:44,088 --> 02:05:00,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, if Ron-chan can't help me, somebody on the interwebs that is hearing this, the tens of people who listen to this show, there are a lot, so if you would like to help me out with some River Song cosplay so that I can go to the Laguna Beach Comic Con, is that the one?

1628
02:05:00,522 --> 02:05:03,224
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm going to Long Beach Comic Con at the end of this month, so...

1629
02:05:04,429 --> 02:05:06,570
[SPEAKER_09]: In the old home of Anime Expo.

1630
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:07,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1631
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:09,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember that place.

1632
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:15,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember walking all over that section of Long Beach in four-inch platform heels.

1633
02:05:16,872 --> 02:05:17,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Not fun.

1634
02:05:18,092 --> 02:05:18,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Not smart.

1635
02:05:19,393 --> 02:05:20,533
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I was cosplaying.

1636
02:05:22,013 --> 02:05:25,494
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary.

1637
02:05:26,074 --> 02:05:27,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1638
02:05:27,235 --> 02:05:30,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence the boots and walking around in wings in a crowded dealer's room.

1639
02:05:30,736 --> 02:05:31,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Not smart.

1640
02:05:31,416 --> 02:05:32,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't do it again.

1641
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:36,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Well Tiara, I can't say this much.

1642
02:05:36,490 --> 02:05:43,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do know a couple of people out in the Vegas area that are cosplayers, so I may be able to cash in a favor or two.

1643
02:05:46,773 --> 02:05:54,794
[SPEAKER_07]: If one of them is somebody that I think it is, that might be a creepy person from high school that I went to high school with, so maybe not.

1644
02:05:56,795 --> 02:05:57,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Male or female?

1645
02:05:58,155 --> 02:05:58,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Male.

1646
02:05:59,534 --> 02:06:00,735
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in luck, they're all females.

1647
02:06:00,775 --> 02:06:03,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the cosplayers I know and commissioners are female, so you're good.

1648
02:06:03,998 --> 02:06:04,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

1649
02:06:04,838 --> 02:06:05,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

1650
02:06:07,361 --> 02:06:08,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you, I got you.

1651
02:06:09,923 --> 02:06:11,104
[SPEAKER_07]: No creeps for you today.

1652
02:06:11,624 --> 02:06:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, one day creep free.

1653
02:06:14,587 --> 02:06:17,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Except when DS Master called in.

1654
02:06:19,631 --> 02:06:20,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I missed that call, so.

1655
02:06:21,252 --> 02:06:22,373
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, you were on hold.

1656
02:06:22,393 --> 02:06:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1657
02:06:22,894 --> 02:06:23,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1658
02:06:24,862 --> 02:06:29,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Ranchan, thank you for your call, and you need to get your ass back out here soon.

1659
02:06:30,245 --> 02:06:36,507
[SPEAKER_11]: As soon as I get some cash monies, me and Joe, Daya, and Missy will come out there and invade for a weekend or two or three.

1660
02:06:36,527 --> 02:06:40,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Or everybody compile and get me out there, because I don't want to be in California.

1661
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:42,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to go to New York.

1662
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:46,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we need to make the Send Jamie and Tiara to New York fund.

1663
02:06:47,062 --> 02:06:55,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and DDR Dollar Bill said I should ship myself there, but I don't know how many air holes I would need, so I'm not sure if that would work.

1664
02:06:55,511 --> 02:06:55,491
32.

1665
02:06:56,351 --> 02:06:57,613
[SPEAKER_07]: 32?

1666
02:06:56,492 --> 02:06:57,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1667
02:06:58,213 --> 02:07:05,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention that they put you in one of those non-compressed compartments and you'll freeze to death, so that's not good.

1668
02:07:06,021 --> 02:07:06,922
[SPEAKER_00]: That would kind of suck.

1669
02:07:07,603 --> 02:07:09,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hey, Loki, when did you show up?

1670
02:07:09,965 --> 02:07:10,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've been here.

1671
02:07:10,953 --> 02:07:11,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1672
02:07:11,453 --> 02:07:14,975
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been looking at porn and playing the magical unicorn fart game.

1673
02:07:15,395 --> 02:07:17,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing either of those, but yes.

1674
02:07:17,997 --> 02:07:20,258
[SPEAKER_09]: That would explain why the stream went out.

1675
02:07:20,558 --> 02:07:21,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Loki.

1676
02:07:21,418 --> 02:07:21,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Loki.

1677
02:07:21,819 --> 02:07:24,700
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it went out from spam overload from the email.

1678
02:07:25,701 --> 02:07:25,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Eep.

1679
02:07:27,522 --> 02:07:27,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1680
02:07:28,442 --> 02:07:30,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So, do you have anything else for us?

1681
02:07:30,823 --> 02:07:33,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us more.

1682
02:07:34,665 --> 02:07:35,846
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's pretty much it.

1683
02:07:35,886 --> 02:07:36,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1684
02:07:36,368 --> 02:07:40,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well we are going to let you go reluctantly, reluctantly.

1685
02:07:41,929 --> 02:07:45,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So, take care and thank you for calling in.

1686
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:46,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime.

1687
02:07:46,631 --> 02:07:47,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantabulous.

1688
02:07:48,151 --> 02:07:48,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

1689
02:07:48,911 --> 02:07:49,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1690
02:07:51,892 --> 02:07:53,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I think that we're about called out.

1691
02:07:53,672 --> 02:08:03,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to leave room for one more call and if not, then we'll go ahead and ask for any last minute stories and wrap the show up in ribbons and bows and call it pretty.

1692
02:08:04,165 --> 02:08:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, so pretty.

1693
02:08:05,866 --> 02:08:07,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadowrunner says someone should cosplay Billy Mitchell.

1694
02:08:10,049 --> 02:08:16,534
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, all that makes me do is when I hear the scout doing the Slap Chop commercial.

1695
02:08:21,558 --> 02:08:22,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, somebody fill time.

1696
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:25,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Time, fill, woo!

1697
02:08:26,324 --> 02:08:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.

1698
02:08:27,365 --> 02:08:28,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Misty's birthday.

1699
02:08:28,927 --> 02:08:30,349
[SPEAKER_05]: We should say happy birthday to Misty.

1700
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:31,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, Misty.

1701
02:08:31,991 --> 02:08:33,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday to you.

1702
02:08:33,953 --> 02:08:35,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday to you.

1703
02:08:35,795 --> 02:08:37,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, dear Misty.

1704
02:08:37,777 --> 02:08:39,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday to you.

1705
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:41,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1706
02:08:41,501 --> 02:08:42,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Now send us cake.

1707
02:08:42,823 --> 02:08:44,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Fresh, fresh cake.

1708
02:08:44,885 --> 02:08:45,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, cake.

1709
02:08:45,746 --> 02:08:46,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Or cupcakes.

1710
02:08:47,415 --> 02:08:48,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I love cupcakes.

1711
02:08:48,836 --> 02:08:49,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.

1712
02:08:50,257 --> 02:08:51,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1713
02:08:51,178 --> 02:08:54,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma's telling everyone to tell GFDia to call in and do coffee talk.

1714
02:08:57,102 --> 02:08:58,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Coffee talk with Jamie and Tiara.

1715
02:09:00,524 --> 02:09:01,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a call.

1716
02:09:01,124 --> 02:09:01,565
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk.

1717
02:09:01,645 --> 02:09:02,145
[SPEAKER_09]: No big whoop.

1718
02:09:05,767 --> 02:09:07,669
[SPEAKER_09]: That Madonna is such a skank.

1719
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:11,320
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my favorite coffee talk.

1720
02:09:12,901 --> 02:09:15,061
[SPEAKER_09]: With Madonna and Roseanne Barr.

1721
02:09:15,542 --> 02:09:17,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Barbara showed up.

1722
02:09:17,562 --> 02:09:18,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she's like, butter.

1723
02:09:21,423 --> 02:09:22,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm still trying to find this.

1724
02:09:22,563 --> 02:09:22,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1725
02:09:28,445 --> 02:09:29,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't find it.

1726
02:09:29,225 --> 02:09:29,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is it?

1727
02:09:30,766 --> 02:09:33,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadowrunner says, the cake is a lie, but pie is constant.

1728
02:09:34,567 --> 02:09:35,167
[SPEAKER_07]: This is true.

1729
02:09:35,787 --> 02:09:36,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

1730
02:09:37,888 --> 02:09:38,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Pie is constant.

1731
02:09:42,541 --> 02:10:09,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't spell today Well, last minute stories I guess Yes please Retailers are apparently listing Duke Nukem Forever for February 1st I can tell you right now that's just an estimate Because they haven't really given out the exact release date yet I'm assuming it's February though Because we have it listed in February as well But not the 1st Because that would be wrong Well, here I've loaded this up Oh, we've got another call coming in, hold on

1732
02:10:10,612 --> 02:10:11,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me add them to our call.

1733
02:10:12,453 --> 02:10:14,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're calling in Orange Lodge Radio.

1734
02:10:14,635 --> 02:10:15,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is this?

1735
02:10:17,176 --> 02:10:18,677
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gio Vidal.

1736
02:10:19,378 --> 02:10:20,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi!

1737
02:10:20,778 --> 02:10:21,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

1738
02:10:21,479 --> 02:10:22,520
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

1739
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,281
[SPEAKER_09]: You've called.

1740
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:26,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can talk.

1741
02:10:26,982 --> 02:10:32,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk, so we can have... We can discuss.

1742
02:10:33,366 --> 02:10:34,047
[SPEAKER_09]: We can be done.

1743
02:10:34,067 --> 02:10:35,168
[SPEAKER_09]: We can has-hasing.

1744
02:10:35,748 --> 02:10:35,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1745
02:10:40,115 --> 02:10:42,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, so how are you?

1746
02:10:48,137 --> 02:10:49,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did your nose hurt?

1747
02:10:51,278 --> 02:10:52,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I pierced my symptom.

1748
02:10:53,698 --> 02:10:54,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun!

1749
02:10:55,338 --> 02:10:57,719
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds about as fun as putting a hole in your face.

1750
02:10:57,739 --> 02:11:01,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

1751
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:04,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did you go and do a silly thing like this?

1752
02:11:06,881 --> 02:11:06,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1753
02:11:09,013 --> 02:11:10,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the time and I had the money.

1754
02:11:11,554 --> 02:11:14,075
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've got the time and money, you should just come out here.

1755
02:11:14,715 --> 02:11:15,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1756
02:11:15,255 --> 02:11:16,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1757
02:11:17,176 --> 02:11:18,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less painful.

1758
02:11:18,976 --> 02:11:25,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was on a weekend vacation at a barbecue competition thing.

1759
02:11:25,098 --> 02:11:27,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at the beach, so I did it.

1760
02:11:28,119 --> 02:11:30,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, it's a weekend.

1761
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:33,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not being able to go out to California.

1762
02:11:34,561 --> 02:11:38,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if everybody else put holes in their noses with you too, oh, I guess you did.

1763
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:46,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's going on on your gaming front?

1764
02:11:48,394 --> 02:11:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually trying to play through the Lego games again.

1765
02:11:53,318 --> 02:11:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, which one are you playing?

1766
02:11:54,939 --> 02:11:55,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through.

1767
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:57,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to play through Batman now.

1768
02:11:58,702 --> 02:12:00,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego Batman is so much fun.

1769
02:12:00,604 --> 02:12:01,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

1770
02:12:01,745 --> 02:12:03,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It absolutely is.

1771
02:12:04,027 --> 02:12:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having so much fun with it.

1772
02:12:06,469 --> 02:12:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's absolutely ridiculous.

1773
02:12:09,611 --> 02:12:11,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fantastic, innocent fun.

1774
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:18,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Lego Indiana Jones is still my favorite though, but I have a soft spot for Indy.

1775
02:12:19,903 --> 02:12:22,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though he's old and walking around with a cane.

1776
02:12:22,825 --> 02:12:27,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have that for the DS, and I like the dumb DS.

1777
02:12:27,668 --> 02:12:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Batman for the DS too, and I played that like crazy, so now I'm just trying to get through everything on the 360.

1778
02:12:34,052 --> 02:12:35,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you play through Arkham Asylum?

1779
02:12:37,413 --> 02:12:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't.

1780
02:12:38,675 --> 02:12:39,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not have it.

1781
02:12:39,957 --> 02:12:43,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to wait for it to come down in price and find it down at price.

1782
02:12:44,503 --> 02:12:46,666
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can find it cheap, I will send you a copy.

1783
02:12:47,487 --> 02:12:46,666
$39.99.

1784
02:12:47,948 --> 02:12:50,852
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can find it cheap at you somewhere, I will find you a copy.

1785
02:12:52,334 --> 02:12:52,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1786
02:12:54,063 --> 02:12:55,103
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really worthwhile.

1787
02:12:55,143 --> 02:13:01,968
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I think I saw it at one of our local used music and game stores for like $20.

1788
02:13:02,028 --> 02:13:03,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say.

1789
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:05,791
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll work out something after the show.

1790
02:13:05,971 --> 02:13:06,672
[SPEAKER_09]: You can PayPal me.

1791
02:13:07,132 --> 02:13:07,552
Okay.

1792
02:13:08,333 --> 02:13:08,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1793
02:13:08,893 --> 02:13:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good.

1794
02:13:10,754 --> 02:13:12,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I still have to send a soundboard to Tiara.

1795
02:13:14,017 --> 02:13:14,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

1796
02:13:15,498 --> 02:13:17,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have stuff to mail you too, so it's okay.

1797
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:20,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And you only sound vaguely Atlantean.

1798
02:13:21,022 --> 02:13:21,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1799
02:13:21,242 --> 02:13:21,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1800
02:13:22,927 --> 02:13:52,021
[SPEAKER_09]: so well I totally I totally suggest the Arkham Asylum game it's pretty fun and you can also just go around and the best thing to do in that game is to get up on the gargoyle heads in some of these areas and then drop down behind people upside down all crazy like and you pick them up and beat the crap out of them and drop them down it's just awesome Batman it's so fun I know see that's the kind of stuff that I do in Metal Gear I just go up behind people and just like strangle them and snap their necks it's

1801
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:55,841
[SPEAKER_09]: See, now in my head I've got Rob's voice going, LOL, you're dead.

1802
02:13:57,062 --> 02:14:01,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of crap that I do in video games, though.

1803
02:14:02,124 --> 02:14:02,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that stuff.

1804
02:14:03,005 --> 02:14:03,965
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the ninja.

1805
02:14:05,265 --> 02:14:06,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

1806
02:14:07,326 --> 02:14:10,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that makes me a little violent, but that's okay.

1807
02:14:10,468 --> 02:14:11,248
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing wrong with that.

1808
02:14:11,268 --> 02:14:12,629
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to blow off steam somehow.

1809
02:14:14,069 --> 02:14:14,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1810
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:20,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do it on video games and kill people and knife them to death.

1811
02:14:21,124 --> 02:14:23,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we know the difference between gaming and reality.

1812
02:14:24,605 --> 02:14:27,987
[SPEAKER_09]: And as much as we imagine doing it to people in real life, we do not actually do it.

1813
02:14:30,228 --> 02:14:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we just wish that the video games were real sometimes.

1814
02:14:33,769 --> 02:14:36,410
[SPEAKER_09]: DDRDollarBill says, remind me not to piss her off ever.

1815
02:14:37,070 --> 02:14:39,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And doesn't want to have this next snap silently.

1816
02:14:41,932 --> 02:14:43,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, let's not do that for reals.

1817
02:14:44,813 --> 02:14:48,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Or what was the line in Silence Good, but let's play Metal Gear for real.

1818
02:14:52,748 --> 02:14:53,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1819
02:14:54,090 --> 02:14:58,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, do you have anything else that you wish to discuss with us?

1820
02:14:59,534 --> 02:14:59,934
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1821
02:15:00,535 --> 02:15:02,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just calling in to say hi, basically.

1822
02:15:03,097 --> 02:15:03,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hello.

1823
02:15:03,677 --> 02:15:04,578
[SPEAKER_09]: We're glad that you called.

1824
02:15:05,219 --> 02:15:05,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, indeed.

1825
02:15:07,741 --> 02:15:08,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Batman!

1826
02:15:09,422 --> 02:15:10,163
[SPEAKER_09]: He's Batman.

1827
02:15:11,704 --> 02:15:12,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Batman.

1828
02:15:12,925 --> 02:15:14,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you take care, and we will end it on Batman.

1829
02:15:16,668 --> 02:15:17,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Batman!

1830
02:15:18,049 --> 02:15:19,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na phone call!

1831
02:15:21,012 --> 02:15:27,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's it for Skype.

1832
02:15:27,815 --> 02:15:36,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go ahead and go on the Do Not Disturb because I will not answer any more of your insolence questions.

1833
02:15:36,998 --> 02:15:37,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not disturb.

1834
02:15:38,439 --> 02:15:40,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I will no longer respond to your insolence.

1835
02:15:43,501 --> 02:15:43,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

1836
02:15:43,861 --> 02:15:45,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any more last minute stories for us, Loki?

1837
02:15:46,102 --> 02:15:46,602
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1838
02:15:47,662 --> 02:15:49,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiara, do you have any last minute stories?

1839
02:15:50,043 --> 02:15:50,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not.

1840
02:15:51,183 --> 02:15:53,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So how about last minute thoughts?

1841
02:15:53,604 --> 02:15:54,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, last thoughts.

1842
02:15:54,604 --> 02:15:55,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any final?

1843
02:15:55,804 --> 02:15:56,504
[SPEAKER_00]: My head hurts.

1844
02:15:56,724 --> 02:16:00,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby's sleeping right now and that means he's going to be up at night.

1845
02:16:00,965 --> 02:16:04,746
[SPEAKER_00]: My head hurts even more knowing that I have to get up at probably 3 in the morning this time.

1846
02:16:07,407 --> 02:16:09,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Time to break out the Vicodin.

1847
02:16:10,508 --> 02:16:12,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't swallow pills so that doesn't work.

1848
02:16:13,549 --> 02:16:14,889
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll put it on your pizza.

1849
02:16:17,688 --> 02:16:21,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And Tiara, for you, any last minute thoughts?

1850
02:16:22,753 --> 02:16:24,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Spocktober, everyone!

1851
02:16:26,617 --> 02:16:28,639
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me all warm and fuzzy and logical.

1852
02:16:30,441 --> 02:16:34,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And my final thought is... Taco Salad defeated!

1853
02:16:35,586 --> 02:16:36,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Dun-dun-dun!

1854
02:16:38,314 --> 02:16:45,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright everybody, well that's been this episode of Orange Lounge Radio sans Rob who never did make an appearance.

1855
02:16:46,299 --> 02:16:48,121
[SPEAKER_09]: How dare he not make an appearance.

1856
02:16:48,861 --> 02:16:49,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Goodnight everybody!

1857
02:16:51,711 --> 02:16:52,251
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week!
