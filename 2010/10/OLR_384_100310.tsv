0	21520	Tonight, October 3, 2010, NBA Jam goes solo on the 360 and PS3, Sonic 4 gets a release
21520	32760	date, and have big titles this year save the PC gaming industry?
32760	36520	Hello everybody, this is episode, what are we on again?
36520	37520	283.
37520	39520	283 of Orange Lounge Radio.
39520	40520	I'm sorry, 384.
40520	43480	I totally threw a random number there, that's kind of funny, huh?
43480	44480	383.
44480	45480	Yeah, 283.
45480	46480	We went back in time.
46480	49400	Rob's gone and the show has become the TARDIS and we have run back in time.
49400	52160	We're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
52160	55520	I got two of the numbers right though, they were just out of order.
55520	58640	Yes, an O-L-R-G, yes, spazzinator.
58640	70120	I am DarkSakra, Jamie Summers, Rob is on a plane, or dead, and then this is Loki, our
70120	71120	tech master.
71120	75800	Do you do any tech stuff lately with us?
75800	81920	I stole some accord the other day out of the box because I need it for something new and
81920	83800	a home, but other than that, no.
83800	86400	Okay, well that's close enough.
86400	92560	So as always we start the show with how was your gaming week, and I normally go first
92560	94280	but I'm not gonna, so you go first.
94280	96920	Oh, actually, wait, wait, wait, wait, we have one more thing.
96920	97920	One more thing.
97920	98920	Cough, cough.
98920	99920	Yes.
99920	101080	Sorry, you're not in the room.
101080	106760	We have a special, special, special co-host tonight, and that's Maren Marvel.
106760	110720	Hi, are you ready to talk video games?
110720	115240	Oh, she broke out the porn voice.
115240	119880	So then why don't we go ahead and start with you for how was your gaming week?
119880	122200	My gaming week was alright.
122200	126840	I played a lot of WoW, I've gotten back into World of Warcraft after not playing for a
126840	128800	long time.
128800	134240	And other than that, pretty uneventful, I played some, I like the music games like The
134240	137640	Lips and The Beatles Rock Band, so I did some of those.
137640	141960	And I've been trying to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years, which came out around
141960	147320	this time last year on the Wii, and I had started playing it and I just like dropped
147320	150800	off the face of the earth, and so I started playing it again.
150800	156440	And now I'm at a point where I'm seriously under-leveled for the area I'm at, so I'm
156440	162720	going to have to go do my least favorite thing, which is grinding and leveling up.
162720	166800	That was always the thing that I could not stand in World of Warcraft, just because it
166800	168360	seemed really monotonous to me.
168360	171080	Yeah, there is that too.
171080	174440	But now I'm playing a warlock, so I've never played a warlock before, usually I play a
174440	178480	priest or a druid, so it's kind of fun and different.
178480	182200	Well it sounds like you're having a good time, and just so that our listeners know a little
182200	186000	bit more about you, would you like to tell them a little bit about yourself?
186000	191920	My name is Tiara, also known as MaronMarvel, I am semi-famous on the interwebs, but not
191920	197360	as famous as Sky and Loki in Dark Sakura.
197360	199400	And we'll make you famous.
199400	200960	Yeah, yay!
200960	204160	This is all sounding very dirty.
204160	207160	We have ways to make you famous.
207160	212040	Now we've got you outnumbered, it's estrogen time.
212040	214440	Yeah, dun dun dun!
214440	217160	It was always estrogen time here with Robs.
217160	222560	He's gonna go back and edit this and go, what?
222560	224360	Although it's the truth.
224360	226880	Okay, well then Loki, how was your gaming week?
226880	235160	I actually didn't play a whole lot, but I did play some stuff on the iPod, and I don't
235160	238240	know, a lot of it was just disappointing, because I go on these binges where I buy a
238240	239240	lot of junk.
239240	245240	Not even necessarily buy a lot of junk, but I download a lot of apps, and that includes
245240	247720	a lot of games, especially stuff that's on sale.
247720	255520	So I went ahead and I downloaded, because it was free, Duke Nukem 3D for the iPod or
255520	258000	iPhone or whatever.
258000	262280	The only problem is I deleted it almost immediately because the controls in it really suck.
262280	266560	Otherwise it's Duke Nukem 3D and it's pretty awesome, but it's just the controls really
266560	269320	suck, so what's the point?
269320	273560	Of course, more Plants vs. Zombies, that was a lot of fun.
273560	283200	I also played a little bit of the newly released Bit.Trip Beat on the iPod, and the only thing
283200	287920	I don't like about that game, and it was kind of the same way when it was on the Wii, where
287920	293880	everything you had to kind of tilt the controller to move your paddle up and down.
293880	297160	Well, you have to tilt the iPod to move your paddle up and down, and I really think it
297160	300640	would have been a lot better if you could just use the touch screen to move your finger
300640	301640	up and down the screen.
301640	305080	It would be a lot more accurate, and it can ramp up the difficulty or something like that
305080	311340	because it's just very awkward for me to tilt the stupid screen.
311340	318080	Then non-iPod stuff, I actually tried the demo for Start the Party, which is one of
318080	322920	the PlayStation Move games, because we had friends over and they wanted to see some of
322920	328680	the Move stuff, and I've got to admit, that game was actually kind of fun, and it kind
328680	333120	of reminds me of the old iToyPlay games, and you might be thinking, oh, iToyPlay, that's
333120	334120	going to be crap.
334120	339760	Well, actually, what's kind of cool about it is the fact that with the camera now and
339760	343440	the motion controllers, you can actually do a lot of the augmented reality stuff.
343440	349140	For example, most of the games actually in that use augmented reality controls, so you'll
349140	355720	have your motion controller that you're holding, and it actually looks like a tennis racket,
355720	361480	and you can move it around in any direction that you want, and it basically looks like
361480	368720	you're holding a tennis racket, and it's very accurate, very fun to play, actually.
368720	374780	They have a lot of, they had a little round in the game where it kind of switches up games
374780	378560	really quick, kind of like WarioWare, and it was actually quite fun.
378560	383320	So I might actually check out the full version of that if, you know, it would be a good party
383320	384320	game or something.
384320	388320	That, and of course, more sports champions play a little bit of that demo as well, because
388320	393800	I still haven't actually gone out to buy any full version Move games yet, because I just
393800	400400	don't usually play in the PlayStation 3, because it's in the main room, and the wife likes
400400	404880	to watch TV and stuff, and there's a baby there, so that kind of makes it difficult.
404880	410720	Then of course, more, you know, Grand Theft Auto, that stuff every week.
410720	417640	But yeah, I've got Dead Rising 2 and Halo Reach to get to, though, so eventually I'll
417640	418640	play those.
418640	425440	I'm actually looking forward to playing Dead Rising 2, so yeah, it'll be fun.
425440	431760	That's pretty much all I played this week, yeah, so that's it.
431760	436080	Well, my week was spent with a little Star Trek Online, but I didn't really play a whole
436080	437080	lot.
437080	440920	I've had kind of a weird week, and I spent the first half of it kind of sick.
440920	444600	So I did get on some Plants vs. Zombies.
444600	450600	Rob came over on Tuesday night to record part of the intro, and he was so funny playing
450600	458160	Super Metroid, because he was doing his Samus that sounds awfully like Rob voice, going
458160	464240	ow, well that hurt, and then there's this one part right before you go to fight.
464240	473440	Was it Craig, Ridley, or one of the, Craig, Craig, sorry, I don't know what, I was thinking
473440	474440	of school.
474440	475440	Craig?
475440	476440	Craig.
476440	477440	No, Craig.
477440	478440	That's the wrong game.
478440	479440	Which we did play.
479440	480760	I know, I know it is.
480760	483720	Which we did play, but I'll get to that next.
483720	487380	But there's this one part where this person is dead and covered in bugs, and the bugs
487380	491640	play off, and Rob's like, LOL you're dead, which I thought was funny.
491640	498240	And then Rob left, and we played Turtles in Time on the SNES, and we beat the game, because
498240	500420	Dan and I are an awesome team.
500420	502640	So Shredder did not dine on turtle soup?
502640	506040	No, but he kept talking about it, and I'm like, dude, don't you have any original lines
506040	507500	or something?
507500	515020	And so, yesterday I went to play, just because we had to go ahead and go buy this really
515020	522080	crappy arcade, I stopped to play Para Para Paradise, which is the first mix plus, and
522080	523080	it was pretty fun.
523080	527480	I actually remembered how to do three of them off the top of my head, and did a decent job,
527480	532820	and of course, I had four songs to play, so I just redid Night of Fire, because Night
532820	534520	of Fire is fun.
534520	541200	And then came home, and I've played some Sims, and mostly it's just been little bits of gaming
541200	546340	except for Tuesday night, because I've had school work and other stuff to do, so that's
546340	547780	been my gaming week.
547780	551640	More eventful than usual, but not as, not really all that busy.
551640	557120	My gaming week will be busier soon, once Fable 3 comes out, because I totally pre-ordered
557120	560120	that this weekend.
560120	561120	So you'll be-
561120	563120	Are you going to yell at the dog?
563120	566960	Already for Dance Masters when it comes out, since you've been playing some Para Para,
566960	574120	that's all that game really is anyways, or not Dance Masters, it's uh, no it is Dance
574120	575120	Masters.
575120	576120	Dance Masters, yeah.
576120	578160	That's right, because there's Dance Central is the other one.
578160	580840	I wonder if there's going to be actual Para Para in it.
580840	581840	It is!
581840	585000	That's what the moves are, they're Para Para, they had Night of Fire on there, and it's
585000	586440	exact same thing.
586440	587440	I'm totally getting this.
587440	588440	Dan, we're getting this.
588440	589440	He's over at my desk.
589440	592120	I do have to get the Kinect though, and that's expensive.
592120	593120	Yeah, that's true.
593120	594120	But I am getting that.
594120	599560	And I actually probably will pick up this game just for fun, because it's funny.
599560	602560	Dan's over there saying that he's sure that we'll have it.
602560	608560	So as for some general housekeeping, like we've been mentioning, Rob is on a giant cylinder
608560	615960	defying the laws of gravity, although he is making good use of the laws of propulsion
615960	619200	and aerodynamics.
619200	620760	So way to go Rob.
620760	625400	He's probably up there asleep or playing as Game Boy or something.
625400	629240	That being said, Rob will probably not be here the entire episode, or if he's here it
629240	633600	will be towards the end, and I'm not making any promises.
633600	634600	Also um...
634600	639840	Which is why we're going to do this episode really quick so that it doesn't happen.
639840	645440	But we do have the lovely Tiara with us tonight, who is always welcome to be on the show if
645440	647080	she ever gets in town again.
647080	648080	Yeah, I know.
648080	651720	I gotta save up some vacation time.
651720	652720	Yeah.
652720	657840	Well, that being said, why don't we hop right into the news head first and get ready for
657840	660160	some decontamination afterwards.
660160	661800	Yes.
661800	666040	So the big news this week, of course, Nintendo had their own little press conference not
666040	671920	to be outdone by Tokyo Game Show, and of course everything Nintendo was covered by.
671920	673560	You're like, bitch, we're Nintendo.
673560	674560	Exactly.
674560	675560	They can do whatever they want.
675560	681300	We're not coming to your conference, we have our own conference, and you can't come.
681300	685680	So they talked, of course, the 3DS, because that's going to be the big release for them
685680	687680	next year.
687680	689720	Lots of details coming out about it.
689720	699680	Of course, it is going to be coming out in February for a lot of money, unfortunately.
699680	704760	I don't think it's going to exactly be that expensive when it comes out over here, but
704760	706880	over there it is quite expensive.
706880	714200	25,000 yen, which is the equivalent of US, or about 300 US, and it'll be out in aqua
714200	719560	blue and cosmos black.
719560	720560	So that's interesting.
720560	724240	February 26, 2011 is the actual date.
724240	729200	They're saying that the estimates in the other regions, it's supposed to come out around
729200	737320	before the end of the first quarter, so probably during their fiscal year.
737320	743480	So that's coming out then, and some other details, of course, came out about it as well,
743480	747980	since they covered everything.
747980	749280	What it'll actually come with when you buy it.
749280	753120	It's going to have, of course, the AC adapter, but what's kind of neat, though, is it has
753120	757720	a charging stand, so you don't have to buy one of those third-party things, just slap
757720	758880	it right in there.
758880	762720	And by the way, when it's sitting in the charging stand, it kind of looks like a little puppy,
762720	765520	so that's kind of weird with the two cameras on there.
765520	767160	It's a cute little puppy.
767160	768880	Oh, that is cute.
768880	778200	Of course, the touch pen and a 2GB SD card, as well as six augmented reality cards, as
778200	780400	well as instruction booklets and all that fun stuff.
780400	784640	And I guess there's actually going to be a built-in augmented reality game that you can
784640	787300	play using the 3DS cameras.
787300	789000	So that'll be kind of neat.
789000	793400	I wonder if the picked up chat's still in there, because that'd be fun.
793400	796520	And of course, other fun stuff that's going to be available.
796520	800840	You will be able to, of course, download games to the console as well.
800840	805440	They're going to have the ability to import games that you've downloaded from your DSi
805440	808920	or DSi XL into the 3DS.
808920	815080	Also, they're going to have a brand new virtual console that's going to cover Game Boy and
815080	817640	Game Boy Color games.
817640	821080	So that'll be out there at some point.
821080	827580	And other fun things, of course, they're going to be having a web browser that actually works
827580	828580	this time.
828580	832280	It's not just some cheap-ass web browser that they're going to tack on later on.
832280	836320	It's actually going to have Flash support in it, I believe.
836320	842240	And they're going to also have kind of a tag mode as well, where you can walk around and
842240	846360	it'll automatically exchange data with other machines, since you won't have to just manually
846360	848840	turn it on.
848840	854640	And some other things that they're talking about with that is possibly doing firmware
854640	857480	updates using that tag mode.
857480	864200	So kind of a way to make sure everybody's not pirating.
864200	869000	I was reading about that, but it also seems to me, though, that all it would take would
869000	870600	be one simple hardware hack.
870600	876040	Well, you could just also turn it off.
876040	878240	That's really worked well for the PSP.
878240	879240	Yeah.
879240	884680	Well, they don't have any sort of tag mode with the PSP, but you can always turn that
884680	886800	stuff off.
886800	891200	You might want to turn it off, say, if you're playing at home, because that's going to use
891200	897640	up a lot of your battery just with the Wi-Fi on all the time.
897640	901960	So that's what's coming out at least for the 3DS stuff, I'm sure.
901960	905960	The big list of games that they were talking about, I mean, everything that you can imagine.
905960	909220	I think they even had video of a bunch of different things.
909220	914400	The new Zelda remakes, Mario Kart looks awesome.
914400	919920	A lot more games we'll be talking about a little bit later, but very exciting stuff.
919920	925260	Well now, you were saying earlier when Bobby called us that you expected it to have a lower
925260	926260	price point.
926260	930320	Yeah, because it'd be dumb to put it out for $300 over here.
930320	931360	People would buy it though, I think.
931360	934040	I don't think so.
934040	936040	People paid $700 for a PS3.
936040	942800	People are not going to buy a 3DS for $300 when the Wii is, you know, $200.
942800	945360	So that's not going to happen.
945360	948600	It'll be $200 is what it's going to be when it comes out over here, I'm guessing.
948600	949840	That'd be my guess, at least.
949840	953920	I mean, it could be very well $250 or something, but I don't think it's going to be $300.
953920	956280	I think $250 would be reasonable.
956280	964000	But yeah, we'll just have to wait and see when more information comes out about that
964000	967080	stuff and once we get closer to the launch.
967080	968640	It'll be here before you know it.
968640	969640	Reckon so.
969640	972440	Well, Tara, do you have any news for us?
972440	976360	Yes I do, especially if you like blue hedgehogs, because...
976360	977360	They're crunchy.
977360	978360	Yes.
978360	979360	Wait, what?
979360	980360	Oh.
980360	988720	Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 is coming out this month, and there are going to be a lot
988720	992120	of different release dates for different platforms.
992120	999520	It's coming out on October 7th for iPhone and iPod Touch through the iTunes App Store.
999520	1005800	You can also get it through the Wii Shop channel on October 11th for 1,500 Wii Points.
1005800	1013400	Xbox Live Arcade, it'll be available October 13th for 1,200 Microsoft Points, or $15.
1013400	1018640	And on October 12th, you can get it on the PlayStation Network for about 13 euros or
1018640	1023560	10 pounds, which I believe is something like a million dollars US, or $15.
1023560	1028360	It's $14.99 actually, but our exchange rate kind of sucks.
1028360	1030920	That's putting it mildly.
1030920	1036000	I was actually watching video of Sonic 4 in action, and it looks like it's a lot of fun.
1036000	1040960	I like the updated look to it, but still the cool 2D style play.
1040960	1041960	It looked fun.
1041960	1043120	I gotta be honest.
1043120	1044120	I have this.
1044120	1045200	I played it.
1045200	1046440	I didn't like it.
1046440	1047440	No?
1047440	1048440	Really?
1048440	1049440	It was just terrible.
1049440	1050440	Like some of the different...
1050440	1053280	They tried to do different things with a few different levels, like they have a mine cart
1053280	1059280	level where you have to rotate the level around, and it just wasn't very fun.
1059280	1063440	But I'm not really one to judge, because I never really cared for the Sonic series too
1063440	1065800	much.
1065800	1069200	But for me, it didn't change my mind about it.
1069200	1071940	So that might be a good thing for people that like Sonic.
1071940	1075460	It's more of the same, but I thought it was terrible.
1075460	1080720	So that's my opinion, but this is coming from someone that doesn't really care for Sonic
1080720	1081720	the Hedgehog.
1081720	1082720	Well, one thing.
1082720	1086880	Now, I did watch someone play through the mine cart level, and it looks incredibly annoying.
1086880	1091800	However, I do like the little air dashes in there, where you can target the enemies and
1091800	1092960	dash at them.
1092960	1095480	That was my favorite thing in Sonic Adventure.
1095480	1096480	So I'm glad that's in there.
1096480	1099160	I mean, that seems to me like it's enough of an innovation.
1099160	1101120	I don't know.
1101120	1104760	We'll see what it is when it comes out, for those of us who don't already have it.
1104760	1110920	Yeah, I think the appeal of stuff like this is definitely that it's like the old Sonic
1110920	1111920	games.
1111920	1117280	It's still 2D, and the graphics are a bit shinier, but it's got that big nostalgia factor
1117280	1120840	for people who are like, like I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog as a kid.
1120840	1126780	So it's like, oh, wow, Sonic, I want to play this just to kind of relive those memories.
1126780	1127880	That's a lot of it here with me.
1127880	1131920	I mean, if they don't change what's not broken, right?
1131920	1132920	Exactly.
1132920	1133920	Yeah.
1133920	1138600	Well, in other news, oh, Bungie.
1138600	1140520	They've done it again.
1140520	1148720	They have banned 15,000 Halo Reach cheaters and are still looking for more to ban.
1148720	1149720	Not technically cheating.
1149720	1152560	They just found a glitch in the game and exploited it.
1152560	1155400	Hey, my story, dude.
1155400	1160360	Anyway, what they did, it was called network manipulation.
1160360	1167320	They were going in, they found an exploit in the challenge, in one of the challenge
1167320	1176000	levels where you could complete it 20 and more times and then keep disconnecting yourself.
1176000	1179920	Or I like, as the Bungie rep said, intentional network manipulation to make it sound like
1179920	1183840	it was something other than pulling out the cord.
1183840	1189040	So they were able to find every one of these.
1189040	1193280	So they've just gone and done a blanket ban.
1193280	1200280	And what happened with the ban itself is that they've actually banned them for 24 hours
1200280	1203920	and removed all of the credits that they earned.
1203920	1206480	And so they won't be able to get any more.
1206480	1210640	Tigerclaw in chat points out that it's still cheating if you exploit a glitch, which I
1210640	1212120	think is true.
1212120	1213120	I agree.
1213120	1214120	I agree.
1214120	1217360	That's just a poor excuse.
1217360	1218360	I'm sorry.
1218360	1221240	If there's a glitch in the game, then you need to patch it and be done with it.
1221240	1229640	If you're using some sort of modified files or modified controllers or something like
1229640	1230640	that, then fine.
1230640	1231640	That's cheating.
1231640	1237280	But if you're using the game and using glitches in the game for your benefit, then I don't
1237280	1238280	see how that's cheating.
1238280	1239360	Because you know why?
1239360	1241320	It's available for everybody to do.
1241320	1244000	It's not something that you have an advantage over somebody else.
1244000	1246360	It's just they need to know how to do that.
1246360	1252040	And if they can do that themselves, then it's just really skill.
1252040	1255800	In other words, Halo makers, patch your damn game and fix it.
1255800	1256800	Well, they are.
1256800	1262080	So it wasn't really anything I don't think that affected a lot of people.
1262080	1267400	It was just credits to buy crap for your characters.
1267400	1271480	I don't even see what the big deal is.
1271480	1275720	It's getting free credits to get free stuff in the end.
1275720	1281240	But then again, I can see it both ways, especially trying to maintain some level of fairness
1281240	1284360	in the game and definitely replayability.
1284360	1289520	The more you play it, the more you have to earn the points the proper way.
1289520	1295560	But one thing I would like to point out is that Halo Reach earned $200 million in its
1295560	1297440	first 24 hours.
1297440	1301840	So that's the biggest Xbox game ever.
1301840	1302840	That's pretty amazing.
1302840	1304840	They're getting their money out of it.
1304840	1306640	Just a little bit.
1306640	1307640	Halo!
1307640	1312320	It prints money!
1312320	1313560	So other fun stuff.
1313560	1316400	Actually, I think you had one more thing.
1316400	1317720	The cover there.
1317720	1319960	Oh yes, Starcraft.
1319960	1321680	Thank you.
1321680	1323720	Because Bungie's not the only people buying in that.
1323720	1326080	Oh, Blizzard's doing it too.
1326080	1331240	Blizzard hit up 5,000 Starcraft 2 cheaters.
1331240	1339800	They actually, for people who hacked and modded their game, they've been permanently banned.
1339800	1343000	And I think they're still on the hunt for more people.
1343000	1344000	But for right now?
1344000	1345000	Nope.
1345000	1346000	Sorry.
1346000	1348000	You cheat, you lose.
1348000	1349000	Bye.
1349000	1350000	K, thanks.
1350000	1351000	Bye.
1351000	1352000	Flush.
1352000	1354920	They're getting serious on it.
1354920	1355920	Yes.
1355920	1363680	Literally, only a week away of its release, NBA Elite 11, the reboot, if you will, of
1363680	1368720	the NBA Live franchise, has been delayed to 2011.
1368720	1374440	And with it, of course, was the opportunity to get a free copy of NBA Jam, which was only
1374440	1379840	going to be available originally through the purchase of NBA Elite 11, at least if you
1379840	1384400	wanted it on PS3 or Xbox 360.
1384400	1388760	Of course, they haven't announced when they're going to ship it yet, but apparently they're
1388760	1395440	going to be shipping NBA Jam as a standalone product on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in time
1395440	1397360	for the holidays.
1397360	1400760	And they haven't said exactly when.
1400760	1407160	I guess it's just a matter of time since the game was pretty much done anyways.
1407160	1412800	And apparently they're not sure what the cost of it will be.
1412800	1417480	Unfortunately, NBA Jam was supposed to be a free game, so if they go and charge $60
1417480	1421400	for it, I think a lot of people are going to feel ripped off.
1421400	1423600	But that'll be coming out sometime this year.
1423600	1429360	Of course, NBA Jam is already available on the Wii, or at least it will be next week.
1429360	1434960	And it's kind of funny, because that just makes NBA 2K11 the only choice for basketball,
1434960	1438340	at least in October.
1438340	1441400	You can go outside and play some real basketball.
1441400	1442640	That would work too.
1442640	1443640	I'm just saying.
1443640	1447800	No, but then they'll fall and skin their knee!
1447800	1457920	I'm actually kind of good at basketball, but I'm very klutzy, so I always am jamming a
1457920	1462160	finger or getting hit in the face with a basketball or something.
1462160	1468320	So yeah, the video game versions are very much safer than actual real life sports.
1468320	1470360	You're not NBA Jamming your finger?
1470360	1473920	Well, I mean, I dig NBA Jam.
1473920	1480320	I think that's probably a game I'd be interested in, at least, versus NBA Elite.
1480320	1485840	But you gotta ask yourself, you know, Elite 11 must have been really fucked up if they
1485840	1487520	got to delay it to next year.
1487520	1491000	I mean, was there some serious problems with that game?
1491000	1497640	Obviously, no one seems to be really asking them, so why was the game delayed anyways?
1497640	1500760	Licensed NBA star here wanted more money for said likeness.
1500760	1506660	There is a rumor, though, that it was done, because there was somebody selling a disc
1506660	1508680	on eBay for the PlayStation 3 version.
1508680	1511000	I'm not sure if that was a demo disc or what.
1511000	1518080	But at least there was some sort of disc pressed for NBA Elite 11.
1518080	1519080	I don't know.
1519080	1521720	It would be interesting to see.
1521720	1528000	I mean, I don't really know if NBA Live 10 was just that terrible that they had to go
1528000	1533120	back to the drawing board with Elite, which, by the way, I think Elite is a dumb name for
1533120	1534120	their series anyways.
1534120	1538520	You know, you have this long-running series that people are familiar with, and let's just
1538520	1542160	get rid of that, because who needs name recognition anyways?
1542160	1543160	It's EA.
1543160	1546520	They're gonna buy anything we put out, right?
1546520	1551320	So I think it's a little elitist that way, and at least they're taking the time to finish
1551320	1552320	it.
1552320	1553320	Yes.
1553320	1554320	No pun there.
1554320	1558280	For the record, mine was fully intended.
1558280	1559280	I don't know.
1559280	1560280	But yeah.
1560280	1561280	Looking forward to NBA Jam.
1561280	1563320	Hope there's lots of presidents in there.
1563320	1564320	Hope Clinton's in there.
1564320	1565320	Of course, Obama.
1565320	1566320	That'd be funny.
1566320	1569760	I think it'd be cool if you could play as Sarah What's-Her-Face.
1569760	1570760	Sarah Palin?
1570760	1571760	Yeah.
1571760	1578320	I'd usually try to put her out of my head, but I'm just picturing now specialized quotes
1578320	1581920	for different political figures that would be funny, like hers would be, hey, I can see
1581920	1584360	Russia from up there.
1584360	1587000	I can see Russia from the court.
1587000	1590760	But anyways, moving on.
1590760	1592320	Yes, please.
1592320	1599600	Since Loki was talking about the 3DS release details, that wasn't all that was talked about
1599600	1604480	during this whole Nintendo conference.
1604480	1609840	Mistwalker's last story was actually given a release date, and it's going to be out on
1609840	1612160	January 27th.
1612160	1618720	But not only that, there's going to be a couple of Wii sequels that they announced at the
1618720	1620000	Nintendo conference.
1620000	1626460	And one is for the Game Boy Advance slash DS, and that's Rhythm Heaven.
1626460	1628000	And I actually did not like that game.
1628000	1633080	I played the first Rhythm Heaven, and yeah, I thought it kind of sucked.
1633080	1634080	It did.
1634080	1635080	Yeah.
1635080	1636080	Yeah.
1636080	1640120	So I don't know why that's exciting news, but it's there, you know.
1640120	1648160	And the other one is a sequel to the Zero series, which is known here as Fatal Frame.
1648160	1650280	Ooh, Fatal Frame is awesome.
1650280	1652100	Yeah, that's kind of a cool game.
1652100	1655600	That's more exciting than Rhythm Heaven, I think.
1655600	1658440	The creep factor is definitely with that one.
1658440	1659440	Yeah.
1659440	1660440	Are you...
1660440	1664280	Am I going to pick up Fatal Frame?
1664280	1665280	No.
1665280	1666280	I want to.
1666280	1667280	I think I am.
1667280	1668280	They already had a Fatal Frame game over here.
1668280	1669280	I just...
1669280	1670280	I don't really care.
1670280	1671280	It was all right.
1671280	1676400	I still need to buy Choanaki, which has nothing to do with Fatal Frame.
1676400	1679640	I don't know if you need to buy that.
1679640	1680640	Okay.
1680640	1684920	It's probably not that good.
1684920	1686800	Oh, come on.
1686800	1690400	It's muscle-bound men flying around shooting things.
1690400	1691400	My mistake.
1691400	1694280	I guess that must be awesome, then.
1694280	1695320	It is awesome.
1695320	1697520	It's laughable and awesome.
1697520	1698520	Indeed.
1698520	1699520	Yeah.
1699520	1707000	Well, now, moving on to another front, PC gaming.
1707000	1714040	It's been speculated that the PC gaming market is on a serious decline, and yeah, we've seen
1714040	1715040	a lot of it.
1715040	1718640	Some of the major franchises just haven't been there or have been turning towards the
1718640	1725520	consoles, but now they're saying that certain titles, certain key titles, will be saving
1725520	1730400	PC gaming altogether, and that's Civilization V and StarCraft II, because, I mean, think
1730400	1731600	about it.
1731600	1736320	When those both came out, they were totally pulling in new players, and on top of that,
1736320	1737320	we've also gotten...
1737320	1742220	This isn't just, you know, in the world of the MMO, because, I'm sorry, World of Warcraft
1742220	1749840	is going to be keeping the PC gaming going, but these have just been really big powerhouses.
1749840	1755000	They've definitely been pulling in the money and getting more people to, you know, upgrade
1755000	1756000	computer bits.
1756000	1762440	Like, we upgraded our graphics card just so that Dan could play StarCraft II, and these
1762440	1764240	are actually pulling in a lot more of the money.
1764240	1769840	Now, other titles that are contributing to this, too, is definitely The Sims 3, because
1769840	1773920	they keep bringing out more and more expansions to that, and I think Steam has the right idea
1773920	1780540	with bringing out more and more PC games, but as far as those in particular, they are
1780540	1782760	exclusively PC developed.
1782760	1787480	They're ones that are definitely trying to keep that whole element of gaming alive, and
1787480	1792120	do you think that they're going to be enough to keep it going?
1792120	1795560	I don't even know if PC gaming is really dead.
1795560	1796560	I mean, it's just...
1796560	1799080	Well, it didn't say dead, just on the decline.
1799080	1801040	I don't even know if that's true.
1801040	1809400	I mean, if anything, I know digital distribution seems to work the best on PC.
1809400	1810400	I don't think...
1810400	1815520	I mean, it's definitely easier sometimes on consoles because you don't have to worry about
1815520	1819960	having the specs to play a game.
1819960	1824720	It's just, you know, it works or it doesn't.
1824720	1825720	I don't know.
1825720	1829160	I don't know if I agree with the statement that it's...
1829160	1834600	I mean, I'm sure it helped because they're big selling games, but there will always be
1834600	1840600	something else that comes out that will be a big selling game in the PC world.
1840600	1851960	Well, now, Civ V got a 91 on Metacritic, which is pretty nice, and Starcraft 2, what is
1851960	1857400	it, 3 million copies have been sold already?
1857400	1861800	So that's pretty crazy, and it got a 93 on Metacritic.
1861800	1864920	So I don't know.
1864920	1869880	I think in some respects, if you look at it in a financial sense, as far as games that
1869880	1875080	come out that just aren't selling very well, then I think that that's where the decline
1875080	1876080	can be seen.
1876080	1880000	Not necessarily the people that enjoy the gaming themselves, but just in the games that
1880000	1883800	have come out and how well they sell, but these two have clearly turned that around
1883800	1884800	if that was the case.
1884800	1885800	Yeah.
1885800	1888800	And then, of course, we've got our MMOs.
1888800	1889800	Always going to be addicts.
1889800	1890800	Right, Tara?
1890800	1891800	Indeed.
1891800	1899680	But for me, there are some MMOs that I can't play because I am on a Mac, so Star Trek Online
1899680	1906600	is completely out for me, and my friend who also owns a Mac has Starcraft 2, and he has
1906600	1908200	incredible problems with it.
1908200	1911360	It's just not as stable.
1911360	1918160	So for me, it's harder to play quote-unquote PC games because I don't own a PC, I own a
1918160	1919160	Mac.
1919160	1924200	Well now, Steam, though, does have a Mac client now with a good number of games.
1924200	1925200	Yeah, that's true.
1925200	1930360	That is true, and I actually have downloaded a couple of games through Steam.
1930360	1935360	So actually, that has opened up the door to me to buy more games, but it's just a lot
1935360	1940140	more difficult, especially if you don't, you know, if you want to go out and you just want
1940140	1944960	to play a game right away and it's not available, it's like, well, I guess I'll just get the
1944960	1947440	console version then.
1947440	1952400	Well, Ranma's suggesting desktop parallels.
1952400	1958880	I just, I don't like Windows, and I don't want to put Boot Camp or anything else on
1958880	1962400	my Mac to run Windows in order to play games.
1962400	1969640	Yeah, that's about what it's going to be like when I have my full Linux box, except Linux,
1969640	1973280	one cool thing about Linux, though, is that it will run multiple environments fairly smoothly
1973280	1977880	if you have the computer with the processing power for it.
1977880	1983480	So I think that Linux users probably have the best of all those worlds.
1983480	1984760	I would agree with that.
1984760	1990520	You know, Linux is a good OS, and it's pretty stable, and it's better than Windows, and
1990520	1992600	that's all I can say about that.
1992600	2000000	And Linux Mint now is in its final production version, so that's pretty cool, but this isn't
2000000	2001800	Linux chat.
2001800	2002800	It's not?
2002800	2003800	No.
2003800	2004800	Oh, okay.
2004800	2007480	It's Orishome's foodie-o, where I'm enjoying a delicious taco salad.
2007480	2009680	Nom nom nom.
2009680	2015240	So now that we've had our mention of food and Linux, how about some release dates?
2015240	2021920	I feel sick since we were talking about food and Linux, mainly just about Linux.
2021920	2024760	I got a sandwich and I thought it would be good, but it's not.
2024760	2030320	Apparently this local grocery store over here, Rayleigh's, they have these mega subs now,
2030320	2032480	and they have like input two different meats and stuff on it.
2032480	2035960	Normally I just get like a turkey and cheese and stuff, but I figured, hey, two different
2035960	2039000	meats, so I better pick two different meats, two different cheeses, I guess I better pick
2039000	2040000	two different cheeses.
2040000	2047920	I have like a turkey, cheddar, provolone, and salami sandwich, and it's not as good
2047920	2048920	as I would have hoped.
2048920	2052520	The salami's too sweet, I guess.
2052520	2056080	Anyways, so lots of stuff coming out this week because we are finally in the fourth
2056080	2061800	quarter and they're kicking it off with lots of games.
2061800	2062800	My mic is steady.
2062800	2065240	Okay, you're cutting out just a little bit.
2065240	2066240	I don't cut.
2066240	2067600	Did you give me the crappy mic?
2067600	2070240	I thought I didn't give you the crappy mic.
2070240	2071240	Well thank you.
2071240	2077800	Okay, anyways, so, lots of stuff coming out this week, of course, the delay of FIFA Soccer
2077800	2082920	2011 on the Wii, it came out a week later than the rest, so poor, poor Wii people had
2082920	2084640	to wait an additional week.
2084640	2091120	Pokemon Ranger Guardian Signs on the Nintendo DS, yay, Pokemon!
2091120	2093720	Pokemans, let us show you them.
2093720	2097560	Hollywood Squares on the Nintendo Wii, yes.
2097560	2100160	Because those games never get old.
2100160	2106980	The Sports Collection from Ubisoft, can we get a more generic name for that, seriously?
2106980	2111560	That's just some sports games, I guess, on the DS.
2111560	2116640	Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on the Wii and DS?
2116640	2119240	I hope Regis is still in that.
2119240	2124720	Enslaved Odyssey to the West coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 this week.
2124720	2128920	It's supposed to be a pretty awesome action RPG.
2128920	2132680	Littlest Pet Shop, got lots of games for that.
2132680	2138000	Littlest Pet Shop, Biggest Star is Blue, Biggest Star is Pink, and Biggest Star is Purple,
2138000	2144200	and yeah, got to purchase all three, I guess, because they're that awesome.
2144200	2148760	Wait until you start buying Blue's Clues and all the kid titles for your little boy when
2148760	2150400	he's older.
2150400	2154800	Uh, no, for one, the other day I'll make those on DS.
2154800	2164240	It's really just Dora or Go Diego Go, or Ni Ha, Kai Lan, um, no one will not be buying that
2164240	2165240	crap.
2165240	2170320	He will have more sophisticated tastes than that, I mean, come on.
2170320	2173040	He's like, you know, I want the Dora the Explorer game.
2173040	2174820	No, he wants a Mario Kart.
2174820	2175820	That's it.
2175820	2178000	Here you go, you shoot the hooker.
2178000	2184280	Hey, I can mod a game of Grand Theft Auto that's not as violent.
2184280	2188520	I have that ability.
2188520	2196920	Ben 10 Ultimate Alien, that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP this week.
2196920	2203280	Def Jam Rap Star, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, also with the version
2203280	2204280	with the microphone.
2204280	2209880	It is the, I guess, karaoke revolution of the rap world.
2209880	2212960	And it must be hardcore because it's got Def Jam in front of it.
2212960	2221480	NBA 2K11, now the only NBA game coming out this year, well, the only simulation NBA game
2221480	2222980	coming out this year.
2222980	2227960	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii.
2227960	2234440	Ah, yes, more kids games, as you were mentioning before, stuff I could purchase for my son
2234440	2235440	later on.
2235440	2240040	Freddy Fish ABC Under the Sea, that's definitely for little kids.
2240040	2247680	Pets, Fantasies, Sunshine Magic, and Moonlight Magic, those are on DS as well.
2247680	2252320	Castlevania Lords of Shadow, the Castlevania game that's not really Castlevania, but has
2252320	2257440	Castlevania entitled Just to Sell More Copies, and that is coming out on PlayStation 3 and
2257440	2261200	Xbox 360 this week as well.
2261200	2269840	Ah, the epic, award-winning I Love Puppies for Nintendo DS, and it's neither of those
2269840	2270840	two.
2270840	2272840	It's just another puppy game where you raise puppies and do stuff.
2272840	2274840	But don't you love puppies, Logie?
2274840	2275840	Puppies are great!
2275840	2279920	Puppies are fine, but I'm not gonna buy another game with puppies in it.
2279920	2283120	I learned the first time, thank you Nintendo.
2283120	2285080	Vampire Moon, the Mystery of the Hidden Sun.
2285080	2287520	It's a vampire adventure game, yay!
2287520	2292160	It was probably one of those hidden picture games, and I guess that's fine.
2292160	2299080	Rapala Pro Bass Fishing 2010, the bundles version of that, with your wireless fishing
2299080	2306680	rod, so you can, I don't know, live out your white trash fantasies, I don't know.
2306680	2311920	Way of the, that's a re-release, if I ever saw one, Way of the Samurai 3, it's already
2311920	2312920	been out.
2312920	2316080	I'm not gonna even mention that again.
2316080	2321560	Um, Final Fantasy, the Four Heroes of Light on Nintendo DS, that's actually a pretty good
2321560	2322560	release.
2322560	2323560	Yay!
2323560	2324560	Yay!
2324560	2325560	Woo!
2325560	2329120	I agree with Ranma, he says fuck all these puppy games, I want a kitty game, dammit.
2329120	2333760	They, okay, listen, they are gonna have kitty games coming out, in fact, I know there's
2333760	2339040	one coming out, but you're gonna have to live with the puppy game for right now.
2339040	2340800	How about a monkey game?
2340800	2343200	They already had a monkey game, okay.
2343200	2344200	There's been a ferret game too.
2344200	2348480	There's been a pets monkeys game, in fact there was two pets monkeys games, and they
2348480	2349980	were terrible.
2349980	2352520	You dressed up monkeys in like little outfits and stuff.
2352520	2353520	That's fantastic.
2353520	2355800	That sounds like the most amazing thing ever.
2355800	2360340	I only remember what, there was some TV show where there's these people that couldn't have
2360340	2364360	children or something, they're really old people, and they ended up dressing up monkeys
2364360	2368240	like children, and would take them out in like baby carriages and stuff like that.
2368240	2371880	It's very, very disturbing, and you can still get that game, so that, you know.
2371880	2374480	Alright, Tiara, we need to go get pets monkeys.
2374480	2376360	Yes, I agree with that statement.
2376360	2377880	Dress up our monkeys.
2377880	2378880	Yes.
2378880	2381520	John Daly's Pro Stroke Golf on Playstation 3, it is-
2381520	2382520	Pro Stroke.
2382520	2384920	Pro Stroke, yes.
2384920	2388240	He's not just an amateur stroke, he can stroke it like a pro.
2388240	2389240	Oh my.
2389240	2394440	That is coming out on Playstation 3, it does support the Playstation move for one-to-one
2394440	2395880	stroking.
2395880	2402840	And then this was, I think, a leftover from last week because, oops, prank party, still
2402840	2406400	hasn't come out yet, thank you Hudson for delaying that another week, so I have to mention
2406400	2409040	it for you, free advertising there.
2409040	2411080	More Bomberman, Hudson, do you hear me?
2411080	2412080	More Bomberman.
2412080	2415840	There's a new Bomberman game coming out on Xbox Live Arcade at some point.
2415840	2416840	Bomberman.
2416840	2417840	I've seen it.
2417840	2421240	My own eyes.
2421240	2427280	Coco Interactive, it's another casual game, Jewel Master Cradle of Athena.
2427280	2431960	Who gives a crap what it's about, it's just a jewel game that you match three.
2431960	2437920	NBA Jam coming out on the Wii, that's right, you get it before the Playstation 3 and Xbox
2437920	2442560	360 versions because it was actually supposed to come out standalone on the Wii.
2442560	2447360	None of this fancy stuff because your game sucks, so you had to delay it and that kind
2447360	2449360	of fun stuff.
2449360	2459480	Um, and that would be it for this week, I know, disappointing, not a lot of pets games.
2459480	2461880	Yeah, needs more monkeys.
2461880	2464120	Definitely more monkeys.
2464120	2471040	Sadly there are no monkeys being released in Japan this week either, but there is enslaved
2471040	2479320	Odyssey to the West on both the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3, as well as F1 2010 on both
2479320	2486400	of those consoles, and Red Dead Redemption and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 are both out on the
2486400	2490460	360 and the PSP as well this week.
2490460	2499520	And on the PS3, but not on the Xbox 360, we have Gekijoban Makros F Itsuarino Utahime
2499520	2508040	Hybrid Pack, yay that's a mouthful, I heard Makros, yes, Makros F to be precise, that's
2508040	2516000	from the new anime Frontier, right, yeah, and Ken Tomahou Togakugen Mono 3 is also coming
2516000	2522800	out for the Playstation 3, and coming out on the Sony PSP this week we've got Bokuakoku
2522800	2531320	Kenseikan Airport Hero Hameda, so that should be something with an airport in it I assume,
2531320	2541360	Kana Imoto is coming out as well as the limited edition version, and Ken Tomahou Togakugen
2541360	2545120	Mono 3 is also coming out on the PSP.
2545120	2553920	And lastly for Japanese releases on the Nintendo DS, we've got Kingdom Hearts Recoded, yeah
2553920	2563160	that's fun, I love Kingdom Hearts, yay, we also have 10 Kaichi Sengoku Lovers, and Maru
2563160	2574440	Gogaku Shikaku Dashu Hanbashi Kente Shiken 2Q 3Q, that's too many QQ's, that's two or
2574440	2581760	three too many Q's, two Q's is sad, three Q's is grateful, sound cute, anyway, that
2581760	2591000	was awful, how about we go jump overboard and swim our way over to the UK, actually
2591000	2595600	I would just rather just be teleported there and stay, that would be great, on the 5th
2595600	2601760	we have Left 4 Dead The Sacrifice for PC and Xbox 360, and on the 5th we also have Fantasy
2601760	2607640	Star Portable 2, on the 8th is a whole crap ton of stuff, Castlevania Lords of Shadow,
2607640	2613480	Enslaved Odyssey to the West, Final Fantasy, The Four Heroes of Light, Front Mission Evolved,
2613480	2622200	John Daly's Pro Stroke Off, cause he likes to stroke it, like a pro in England, oh dear,
2622200	2632800	PES 2011, We Party, and WRC on a bunch of systems, and that would be it for the UK.
2632800	2639560	Alrighty, well one game that's not coming out this week, or even when it was intentionally
2639560	2647640	gonna come out back in April of 2011, Gears of War 3 has been delayed to the 4th quarter,
2647640	2652320	no reason why, I'm sure it's just to add extra polish, or because Microsoft realized hey,
2652320	2657820	we don't have a good 4th quarter game, so it will not be coming out when it's intended,
2657820	2662040	but you know what, there's plenty of games coming out in April, and hell, I wouldn't
2662040	2673720	want to take any more time away from Marvel vs. Capcom 3, so I'm fine with that delay.
2673720	2680160	I definitely, I think I could just totally ignore any Gears of War for Marvel vs. Capcom
2680160	2685680	3, because that game is full of the awesome and tons of characters I want to play.
2685680	2692800	Yeah, MVC 3, yes, Gears of War 3, probably not, because I haven't played Gears of War
2692800	2696920	1 or 2, just saying.
2696920	2703200	I don't know, I think I'm most excited for playing as X-23 in Deadpool.
2703200	2708280	I don't know about Deadpool, but yeah, Deadpool in video games is kind of cool because he's
2708280	2712760	aware that he's a video game character, and he has all the funny lines, but there's too
2712760	2713760	much Deadpool.
2713760	2715480	Deadpool is self-aware now.
2715480	2716480	Yes.
2716480	2722480	Well really, don't get us started on Deadpool, because we always have the weekly Deadpool
2722480	2728440	rant on comic insanity, plug plug plug.
2728440	2735720	But a game that is coming out that is not being delayed, well, it's not being delayed
2735720	2741600	because it came out in 2003, and I remember playing this game on the PS2, is Beyond Good
2741600	2742600	and Evil.
2742600	2743600	Do you guys remember that game?
2743600	2744600	Yes.
2744600	2745600	Yeah.
2745600	2748740	That was a good game, and it's actually getting an HD re-release.
2748740	2754560	So Ubisoft is going to be re-releasing the game in high definition, and they haven't
2754560	2758120	said when, but sometime in 2011.
2758120	2760440	That sounds like it will be a treat.
2760440	2761440	Yes indeed.
2761440	2763000	I'm very excited about that.
2763000	2764680	I really loved that game.
2764680	2767160	It was a good game.
2767160	2776560	Well now it's time for the classic game of the week, and because I do this, it's kind
2776560	2781560	of weird for me to have to manipulate the music and everything at the same time, so
2781560	2786840	I'm actually just going to stop that, because I don't have Rob's mad skills to do them all
2786840	2788440	at the same time.
2788440	2792680	And I will instead start off with a little bit of music, and I'd like to see how many
2792680	2795040	people can guess what it is.
2795040	2796040	Just by the opening.
2796040	2797040	Very beginning.
2797040	2800040	Presented by Sega.
2800040	2801040	That should be clue enough.
2801040	2804080	Hey, we are the Sonic Team.
2804080	2809080	Yes, the game of the week is Samba de...
2809080	2811080	Samba de amigo!
2811080	2813080	Samba de nidé!
2813080	2814080	Woohoo!
2814080	2815080	Party!
2815080	2817560	I have a special love of Samba de amigo.
2817560	2819560	Uno, due, dre, cuatro.
2819560	2823160	God, the music is just so perky.
2823160	2828960	I feel like shaking my butt, or some maracas, or maybe the microphone like a maraca.
2828960	2830280	Or all three of those.
2830280	2835680	I will do them all at the same time, which makes it really bad for radio.
2835680	2842040	At any rate, as we've been talking about maracas, yes you use maracas as your controllers, and
2842040	2845560	they have these little sensors on the bottom.
2845560	2852000	And what you do is, you have to hit these little, there's two in the middle that are
2852000	2855000	on the top, and two in the middle that are on the bottom, and then two out to the side.
2855000	2856480	Well, one on each side.
2856480	2862200	And you have to hit the right little sphere with your maraca at the same time, and it
2862200	2864520	uses the motion sensor to make sure you're in the right place.
2864520	2869360	You have to actually adjust it by your height so that you can make sure that you're going
2869360	2871880	to hit the sensor at the right place.
2871880	2880720	And this game was played at many a New Year's party at my house, I can say.
2880720	2888360	The game uses lots of different Latin-styled music, and you are, on screen you are represented
2888360	2890640	by a monkey named Amigo.
2890640	2893000	We're back to monkeys, Takara.
2893000	2895600	Yay, monkey!
2895600	2899960	And he will dance, and the better you do, he'll do the ice-crunchy Cartman face and
2899960	2904160	start dancing even more, and then the sky will turn all rainbows, and so you either
2904160	2916360	shake high, or you shake middle, or you shake low, and when you hit the blue areas, you're
2916360	2920380	just going to hit it once and shake, but you have red ones that tell you just to shake
2920380	2923320	it over and over and over and over and over again.
2923320	2929360	And then the stickly man comes up on the screen, which we all know stickly man from his next
2929360	2936920	job working for Homestar Runner, but he poses, and you have to match that pose by holding
2936920	2941320	each maraca at the right position, as indicated on the screen.
2941320	2944360	So you can pick three songs and play through each of them.
2944360	2947440	You can play them easier or harder.
2947440	2953240	You also have little mini-games, one called Guacamole, which is actually pronounced Guacamole,
2953240	2958340	like Whack-a-mole, and Strike a Pose, where you have to do different series of poses,
2958340	2963800	and one, two, samba, where you have to hit different spots in sequence.
2963800	2969760	In the Japanese version, it's called ichinii samba, which is a funny pun in Japanese, because
2969760	2973040	it's one, two, three, but samba, yeah, anyway.
2973040	2977440	There's party mode and battle, where you can play versus couples game.
2977440	2981440	There's a couples game version, which in Japan is called Love Love, where you play through
2981440	2984520	the song to see how compatible you are.
2984520	2993240	And then in later versions, in version 2000, there's different things to play in there,
2993240	2999720	like hustle mode, where you have to follow the dots and shake the maracas the right way,
2999720	3005440	but you have to do things in these really weird poses, and you're actually moving the
3005440	3008920	full 360 rotation around, so it's kind of interesting.
3008920	3014440	There's also different versions out that have extra songs in there.
3014440	3021520	In version 2000, there's another monkey out called Amiga, who plays a tambourine, and
3021520	3022980	she's very fun.
3022980	3035200	In the other versions that came out, there actually are other songs that were in different
3035200	3042480	Sega games, like for downloadables, you had the theme from After Burners, you had Burning
3042480	3044680	Hearts from Burning Rangers, which I love.
3044680	3049560	You also have the Rent-A-Hero theme, which is incredibly funny, stuff from Nights, stuff
3049560	3056800	from Sonic Adventure, Jet Set Radio, Daytona USA, Outrun, Fantasy Zone, the Oppa Oppa theme
3056800	3062640	is in there, Sonic CD, the Japanese opening song is in there, Super Sonic Racing from
3062640	3068140	Sonic R, and just a bunch of cool stuff, but as far as the songs in the game, definitely
3068140	3074000	some people might recognize Mambo No. 5 and Mexican Flyer, well anyone who played Space
3074000	3081720	Channel 5 and watched Swing Girls should know that song anyway, Oya Como Va by Santana,
3081720	3087840	Papa Loves Mambo is in there, also SOS The Tiger Took My Family by Dr. Bombay is in there,
3087840	3091160	which has nothing to do with Latin music.
3091160	3093120	And yet is still awesome.
3093120	3094280	Yes.
3094280	3101720	And one of my favorite things to play in there was actually the Cup of Life is in there,
3101720	3106920	I thought it was funny, and the Stupid Catch-Up Song is in there, which I always avoided,
3106920	3108880	and Highway to Hell is in there.
3108880	3110760	In the Wii version anyway.
3110760	3111760	So yeah.
3111760	3113840	That has a lot to do with Latin music.
3113840	3121800	I'm going to play the combination of Highway to Hell and Tub Thumping, which is also in
3121800	3124400	all of the versions.
3124400	3129960	It's really fun, actually the Wii version did come out, but it didn't get very, very
3129960	3132780	good ratings.
3132780	3138460	It has some extra stuff in there, it has Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet, and Mambo Mambo,
3138460	3146920	and I Want Candy, and it's got other characters in there, such as Sonic and Ooh La La.
3146920	3153320	And you can, it will use your little me's, and put some right by your score.
3153320	3158200	And it changes the different expressions that are used based on your performance in the
3158200	3160000	game.
3160000	3166440	There was a successor out that not many people know about, I've actually played it, that's
3166440	3174000	called Shakuto Tambourine, which is played just like Samba de Amigo, except you use a
3174000	3177320	tambourine controller and it's all J-Pop music.
3177320	3183640	And there was a version of Samba de Amigo, kinda, that was the itoy version for Sega
3183640	3190060	Superstars, where it used the itoy to hold where your hands were, instead of the sensors
3190060	3191600	like the maracas used.
3191600	3197240	And by the way, Shakuto Tambourine is actually really fun and very hard, just saying.
3197240	3198240	Very hard.
3198240	3201720	Because you've only got one tambourine, and you have to do these little swiping moves
3201720	3205360	over your head and shake the tambourine at the same time, and it's kind of a pain in
3205360	3206360	the butt.
3206360	3211520	Anyway, you've got characters, you have Amigo, who we've mentioned is a monkey, and Amigo,
3211520	3214460	who is also a monkey, woohoo!
3214460	3219960	And we have Linda, who is the Samba school dancer that wears the butterfly costume.
3219960	3223080	And Bingo and Bongo, they're bears that play the bongos.
3223080	3226440	Rio is a cat person who's like a cat and a jaguar.
3226440	3229480	He carries a rose and a horn, ooh.
3229480	3234720	There's Chumba and Wamba, who play the mandolin and the conga drums, and they're named after
3234720	3236720	Chumbawamba.
3236720	3241800	And Mr. Pose, who is also known as Stickley Man.
3241800	3248080	And that is the game, that is Samba de Amigo, which I personally think the Dreamcast ones
3248080	3252240	are the best, but that would be me.
3252240	3256880	So anybody else enjoy Samba de Amigo?
3256880	3262200	Samba de Amigo is awesome, but like all the animals, the way that you describe the characters
3262200	3269560	just now, it makes me think of like old Disney cartoons like DuckTales and Tailspin, where
3269560	3274560	it's like a town full of weird animals doing stuff that people usually do.
3274560	3281320	It sounds like Samba de Amigo belongs in like, you know, the Disney kind of world.
3281320	3287040	Yeah, I guess so.
3287040	3294320	Maybe they've got their own like Amigoville, where they all hang out and drink Nescafe.
3294320	3298480	I used to play Samba de Amigo a lot, like a million years ago.
3298480	3299800	It was a long time ago.
3299800	3300800	It was a good game though.
3300800	3301800	It was fun.
3301800	3302800	Oh, it's fantastic.
3302800	3306640	Some of my old New Year's parties that we used to have over here were always, I mean
3306640	3311240	rock bands pretty much replaced just about everything music related, but would always
3311240	3317080	break out DDR and Samba de Amigo and pretty soon just be drunk in Samba de Amigo, surrounded
3317080	3323520	by lots of beer and people would fall over and I would tell them not to break my maracas.
3323520	3328160	I still have my maracas and I still, I should dust them off and play them soon.
3328160	3330040	You should.
3330040	3335560	Well, we are now though, sadly at the end of part A, but this means we get to go into
3335560	3339000	part B. Yay.
3339000	3341600	So everyone stay tuned.
3341600	3347240	We're going to go to a little break and we will hear you when we, we will hear you.
3347240	3349280	We will talk to you when we get back.
3349280	3350960	You will hear us when we get back.
3350960	3352960	I can't hear them.
3352960	3354960	Ah, no.
3354960	3355960	Okay.
3355960	3368880	Welcome back to part B of episode four, three hundred and eight, the three eighty four.
3368880	3369880	Three eighty four.
3369880	3370880	Yes.
3370880	3371880	Episode yes.
3371880	3372880	Of Orange Lounge Radio.
3372880	3374480	I am the Dark Sakura.
3374480	3381200	This is Loki and joining us is Mar and Marvel, also known as or known in real life as Tiara.
3381200	3382200	Woo hoo.
3382200	3384720	I just told them your secret identity.
3384720	3385720	Oh no.
3385720	3389920	So it's like you unmasked me in front of millions and millions of people.
3389920	3395160	Now I'm going to have to make a deal with the devil and have my entire history changed
3395160	3397320	so that nobody knows who I am.
3397320	3399600	Except really the Illuminati is behind it.
3399600	3400600	Yep.
3400600	3401600	Yeah.
3401600	3410840	So welcome back, but that's another reference to perhaps a different podcast that Tiara
3410840	3411840	and I do.
3411840	3412840	Hmm.
3412840	3413840	Perhaps.
3413840	3417880	A different friend of ours who is also an Orange Lounge listener.
3417880	3420200	So welcome back to the show.
3420200	3426560	As I said, we have got some rapid fire news coming up and tweeter topics because they're
3426560	3428960	tweety and good.
3428960	3434640	And if you're all good, then Tiara might do it in a porn voice.
3434640	3435640	Perhaps.
3435640	3436640	Perhaps.
3436640	3437640	Perhaps.
3437640	3438640	Mayhaps?
3438640	3439640	Mayhaps.
3439640	3440640	Mayhaps.
3440640	3442640	We may have porn voice tonight.
3442640	3443640	Hahaha.
3443640	3444640	Okay.
3444640	3445640	So why don't you get us started, Loki?
3445640	3450960	Finally, we've been begging and pleading for Capcom to listen, and they have Mega Man Legends
3450960	3453200	3 has been announced.
3453200	3460100	Coming to the 3DS, of course, right now it's just Project, or Mega Man Legends 3 Project.
3460100	3465760	It's a work in progress, I guess, and we'll be coming out at some point, I'm guessing
3465760	3466760	probably next year.
3466760	3469120	So that'll be kind of cool.
3469120	3474200	And of course, this week, like every other week, Rock Band Download content.
3474200	3475200	Got lots of it.
3475200	3477760	This week we've got REM.
3477760	3481280	They have a pack there, including Driver 8.
3481280	3484720	It's the end of the world as we know it.
3484720	3486760	Living Well is the best revenge.
3486760	3494200	Radio Free Europe, Stand, Superman These Days, and What's the Frequency, Kenneth.
3494200	3498780	Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in fake points.
3498780	3503040	Or you can get the pack for $13.49 or 1080 Microsoft Points.
3503040	3509220	Sorry, it's not available for a pack on the WiiWare store.
3509220	3513120	Also the T-Rex pack, featuring 3 songs from them.
3513120	3516960	Children of the Revolution, Cosmic Dancer, and Jeepster.
3516960	3521320	Also those available for $2 each or $5.49 for the whole pack.
3521320	3524680	So that'll be coming this week.
3524680	3526960	And unfortunately no standalone songs.
3526960	3529320	I guess it's just those two packs.
3529320	3533880	You can purchase a song standalone in there, but nothing additional.
3533880	3541840	And then finally, there's been some new information coming out about my game of the year next
3541840	3542840	year.
3542840	3545320	Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
3545320	3546320	Some gameplay video.
3546320	3548600	Looked absolutely awesome.
3548600	3555280	Of course, they had some details regarding the gameplay in case anyone had concerns.
3555280	3558640	First off, there's actually some new armors that you can use in the game.
3558640	3562400	They have 4 different ones that you can kind of swap around through.
3562400	3566440	You will still be limited to 2 weapons per mission, which kind of sucks because I really
3566440	3567440	wish it was 3.
3567440	3568440	But whatever.
3568440	3569440	I'll deal.
3569440	3577280	And 150 weapons, also I believe you can earn different points to increase abilities on
3577280	3579720	your player as well as the weapons that you have.
3579720	3584160	There will also be an equivalent to the genocide gun in the game, which for those who haven't
3584160	3588640	played Earth Defense Force 2017, the genocide gun is a gun that fires a really big laser
3588640	3591520	blast that blows up a lot of stuff.
3591520	3597160	The title itself will also run very smoothly as opposed to the last game that came out,
3597160	3600920	where you can actually have up to 80 enemies on the screen and the game will actually keep
3600920	3603400	running smoothly at 30 frames per second.
3603400	3609600	The game will also feature some increased difficulties as well, the legendary infernal
3609600	3610600	mode.
3610600	3615000	It's going to take about 8 hours to complete the game on normal mode, but normal is for
3615000	3617760	wimps, so no one should actually play it on normal.
3617760	3622400	And they're also going to have a 6 player horde mode, which apparently you will be pitted
3622400	3625960	against endless waves of enemies that will attack you relentlessly.
3625960	3629840	Also a remix mode where random enemies will spawn instead of the normal enemies that appear
3629840	3632520	during the campaign.
3632520	3637440	And if you're very interested in checking it out, there's some gameplay video on Destructoid
3637440	3639720	and oh my god it looks awesome.
3639720	3646520	I was kind of worried though with the developer being the one that did the Matt Hazard game
3646520	3651920	and that wasn't that great, but it looks cool and the dialogue is extremely cheesy, so it
3651920	3653320	should be cool.
3653320	3659920	One other thing, the game will actually have 3 player co-op drop in drop out.
3659920	3663380	They're also going to have 2 AI controlled bots that will fight alongside of you in case
3663380	3665560	you don't have actual friends to play with.
3665560	3669680	And apparently they are pretty good and they'll actually help you out through the game, otherwise
3669680	3671920	you can get people to help you out.
3671920	3675400	And definitely looking forward to this, going to probably pick up about 3 copies of it,
3675400	3686840	so make sure I have one for each person to play at my work, so yeah, check it out.
3686840	3690440	And we got any more news, Tiara?
3690440	3692240	Yes we do.
3692240	3698440	Those of you who have pre-ordered your keyboard bundle for Rock Band 3 on the PS3 may have
3698440	3705680	noticed that it has disappeared from US retail sites and that's because there is a contract
3705680	3711600	problem where Harmonix cannot sell the PS3 keyboard bundle.
3711600	3716760	So you will have to buy your keyboard for $10 extra, but you can still buy the bundle
3716760	3724080	on the Xbox 360 and Wii, so that's good, yay, because I have the Xbox 360.
3724080	3732240	And also, Konami is releasing an awesome, awesome, awesome new 3D racing arcade game
3732240	3738220	called Road Fighters, and it's got like a cabinet with a steering wheel, and it has
3738220	3742560	drop down 3D glasses, so that's kind of awesome.
3742560	3747640	And you can switch between 2D and 3D by pushing a button, and I don't know, it seems cool,
3747640	3753220	I love arcade games like this, I suck at racing games, but it just looks cool, and 3D is the
3753220	3760840	whole new fad of TV, movies, and gaming, so it should be interesting, and it does look
3760840	3762240	really cool.
3762240	3769960	The glasses look ridiculous, I have to say, but it should be fun, and 3D really I think
3769960	3775240	is an excellent element for a racing game, since you are right in there with all the
3775240	3777080	cars and all the excitement.
3777080	3779120	The glasses look 80s-tastic.
3779120	3783600	They do, they really do, I think that's part of the reason it's so awesome.
3783600	3785960	That's great.
3785960	3792560	And lastly, with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 coming out, and Street Fighter 4 released lately,
3792560	3796120	and things like that, what about Darkstalkers?
3796120	3801880	I would like to see another game having something to do with Darkstalkers, wouldn't you?
3801880	3802880	Absolutely.
3802880	3809040	Well, Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono told Eurogamer that making another game in the series would
3809040	3815400	be his ultimate dream, and it can only happen if fans demand it.
3815400	3822880	And he said that it's all up to the readers to get Inafune-san interested in doing the
3822880	3829040	game, and according to Ono, it would take 1 million requests before Inafune says yes.
3829040	3834160	So unfortunately there haven't been that many requests for the game.
3834160	3840860	There have been about 5,000, so only 995,000 more requests for a Darkstalkers game before
3840860	3843360	they will consider making one.
3843360	3844360	Get on it, peeps.
3844360	3845920	I'm not gonna put my name in there.
3845920	3852800	It's dumb, I mean come on, they're doing this crap that they did with, like, what, uh, paranormal
3852800	3853800	activity.
3853800	3857080	They're doing the same shit with the second movie too, by the way, where, demand it in
3857080	3858080	your city.
3858080	3859080	No, how about I don't?
3859080	3860080	Because the first movie was terrible.
3860080	3861080	Yeah, as I said-
3861080	3863080	I demand that you don't put it in my city.
3863080	3868040	More like Paris Normal activity, I thought it was the worst movie ever, but I digress.
3868040	3870640	This is Darkstalkers, and Darkstalkers is awesome.
3870640	3876080	Yeah, but I think that they should know that the interest is out there, and if they made
3876080	3880880	the game, that people would buy it, and you know, for them to be like, oh no, you have
3880880	3882480	to ask us for it.
3882480	3885960	Well just make the freaking game, it's not like you're gonna be losing money on it.
3885960	3887520	Well ask for it with our dollars.
3887520	3888520	Yes.
3888520	3889520	Or our yen.
3889520	3890520	Or whatever.
3890520	3895280	If you say it bluntly, it's like saying, okay, listen, you gotta suck my cock, but you're
3895280	3900600	gonna have to beg for it first, I mean, that's, that's the way they're putting it, I mean,
3900600	3902400	it's just, it's insulting.
3902400	3907040	I mean, if you wanna put out a game, put out a good fighting game, because people are gonna
3907040	3909500	buy any fighting game that you put out.
3909500	3911000	Don't make people beg for it.
3911000	3914900	We own the recipe for these fantastic lollipops, but a million of you must say that you want
3914900	3917440	our lollipops.
3917440	3920360	And by lollipops, we mean cock, so.
3920360	3926760	I was trying to do something that every, who does not like a good lollipop, I mean, please.
3926760	3931680	Well, how about the other things that are definitely gonna be coming out.
3931680	3936960	Square Enix is actually making adjustments to bring out Parasite Eve on PSN, and I don't
3936960	3941320	know about you guys, but Parasite Eve was pretty fun, although I do have to say there
3941320	3945600	were other games that I thought were more fun, but Parasite Eve was pretty cool.
3945600	3948880	Not bad for a game based off of a book.
3948880	3954720	So they're basically just gonna be bringing it out, they just have to tweak it, so that
3954720	3955720	it'll be playable.
3955720	3958440	And it's not just Parasite Eve, it's Parasite Eve 2 on the PSN.
3958440	3960720	Did you ever see the live action movie?
3960720	3962440	I have it somewhere, I haven't watched it.
3962440	3965640	I've been trying to look for the translated version of the book.
3965640	3968400	I think I have it on VCD somewhere.
3968400	3972480	I've got a VCD of it, yeah, that's, my copy's on a VCD as well.
3972480	3977400	I just sorta, oh, that's cool, and then, oh, look what else we've got, Final Fuck X.
3977400	3979580	Cause I think I got them both at the same time.
3979580	3982040	That was also based off a book.
3982040	3983040	Not really.
3983040	3984040	Okay.
3984040	3987360	And, moving forward, how about Scott Pilgrim?
3987360	3995000	The new download content is going to have, for Scott Pilgr- I said Spock Pilgrim.
3995000	3996000	Spock Pilgrim.
3996000	4000400	I would buy Spock Pilgrim, cause it is Spocktober, you know.
4000400	4001400	Yes it is.
4001400	4006980	For Scott Pilgrim vs. the World the Game, there is going to be new download content
4006980	4010460	to go along with the film's release on DVD and Blu-ray.
4010460	4015720	It will have a new playable character, Knives Chow, along with two other modes.
4015720	4020520	That's an arena battle with weapons, kind of a light version of Super Smash Brothers
4020520	4022520	it's described as, and dodgeball.
4022520	4029880	And it will be $1.99 on Playstation Network or 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.
4029880	4035980	And they also are going to fix some of the difficulty balancing to make it, the average
4035980	4043360	Joe level, more forgiving, and get rid of some bugs, and do drop in, drop out co-op.
4043360	4046640	It's only though for offline play only.
4046640	4055160	And they're not going to incorporate the online MMO into it, so none of that yet.
4055160	4062020	And then, speaking of Spock, Star Trek Infinite Space is to be coming out.
4062020	4071160	It's a free-to-play browser version of the game, so Mac people can play it.
4071160	4073400	And it will be out in the summer of 2011.
4073400	4080320	It's going to be published by Gameforge and developed by Keen, who also did What's Cooking
4080320	4083960	with Jamie Oliver.
4083960	4085760	And now this is the part that makes me happy.
4085760	4087280	It's set during Deep Space Nine.
4087280	4088280	That's cool.
4088280	4092880	I thought you were going to say Jamie Oliver is in the game, so that's exciting.
4092880	4093880	No.
4093880	4095680	That's not special.
4095680	4100560	The only cooking I want is the Klingon chef who plays the violin.
4100560	4101880	Yes.
4101880	4103520	And sings opera.
4103520	4105440	Klingon opera is the best.
4105440	4106520	Yes it is.
4106520	4109920	And serves half-dead gah.
4109920	4115880	And of course, you should hopefully be able to read Shakespeare and its original Klingon
4115880	4116880	in this game.
4116880	4119200	Because it sounds the best in its original Klingon.
4119200	4120200	Yes.
4120200	4128840	But the director, Anthony Christolakis, I guess, Greek name, we consider ourselves very
4128840	4132020	lucky to have this opportunity and we are highly committed to delivering a Star Trek
4132020	4135240	experience fans can be proud of.
4135240	4136600	Yay!
4136600	4144160	And well, it's not STO, but I like that it's set in the Deep Space Nine universe.
4144160	4149160	That makes me particularly happy, because Deep Space Nine was my favorite.
4149160	4154360	Well, it's, you know, TNG was going on at the same time as Deep Space Nine, so it's
4154360	4160000	probably going to be more focused towards the war, I'm guessing, with the Jem'Hadar.
4160000	4164720	So that'll be pretty awesome, because that was really a great arc, a great story in the
4164720	4165880	Star Trek universe.
4165880	4170280	I agree, and it certainly opened up lots of fantastic characterization for all kinds of
4170280	4173540	people in the series, so I thought it was fantastic.
4173540	4180920	So moving forward, we've had another visitor come into the room who is not supposed to
4180920	4181920	be in the room.
4181920	4184920	You need to go find your mommy.
4184920	4186920	Please shut the door.
4186920	4189120	Thank you, Punkin.
4189120	4190120	Sorry.
4190120	4191680	She didn't shut the door.
4191680	4192680	She didn't shut the door.
4192680	4194680	Off with her head!
4194680	4197420	Oh, that was Sophie.
4197420	4201120	That is my cousin-in-law's daughter.
4201120	4202120	Ah.
4202120	4205280	Yes, we have lots of children over right now.
4205280	4208800	She was excited about Star Trek, can you blame her?
4208800	4210000	Yeah.
4210000	4216040	She came in wearing my Indiana Jones hat when we were talking about Star Trek, so where
4216040	4217040	were we?
4217040	4221720	Oh yes, we were over to, um, Twitter Topics, weren't we?
4221720	4223680	What do we use for Twitter Topics again?
4223680	4224680	Journey to Wonderland?
4224680	4225680	Oh.
4225680	4226680	Um.
4226680	4228680	Well, we're using it.
4228680	4232200	It's Twitter Topic time.
4232200	4238000	I don't have any Twitter Topics, so we forgot to tell them to send Twitter Topics.
4238000	4239000	I did not forget.
4239000	4241000	I told them to do the break.
4241000	4245760	Yeah, we told them in the chat room to send the Twitter Topics, so we do have some Twitter
4245760	4246760	Topics.
4246760	4249240	And, uh, let's see.
4249240	4256880	Tigerclaw305 sent us a story about ex-Nintendo sales chief to lead Kidzania's creation of
4256880	4259120	kid-sized cities.
4259120	4260760	So let's see what this is about.
4260760	4264640	I found the right music.
4264640	4268200	Ah, that sounds more like it.
4268200	4270200	Now you can continue.
4270200	4275520	Kidzania is creating places for kids to learn about real life jobs and entertain themselves
4275520	4278620	in many cities with shopping malls.
4278620	4283840	So I don't know, it sounds kind of like some kind of Second Life type thing.
4283840	4285600	I don't know.
4285600	4288640	Second Life equals no life.
4288640	4290200	Yeah.
4290200	4298640	And Tigerclaw305 also sent that the Just Cause film has been optioned, and the movie script
4298640	4307200	will be written by Michael Ross, and it will be produced by Adrian Ascaria, and that should
4307200	4312200	be kind of cool or probably crappy because video game movies kind of suck.
4312200	4317000	When asked why they decided to make the movie, they said Just Cause.
4317000	4318600	Well sure, why not?
4318600	4319960	We're gonna make it.
4319960	4322240	That's the reason, yes.
4322240	4328080	And for the record, Shadowrunner says Fallout Children.
4328080	4334000	Let's see, Jay Jugo says, hey guys, I'd like this new way to present a co-host on the show.
4334000	4336060	This is a must keep, in caps.
4336060	4338520	Never forget, in hashtag.
4338520	4339520	Never forget.
4339520	4340520	Never.
4340520	4349600	Okay, and Spazinator says, in my porn voice, hey, there's a crap ton of new free vids on
4349600	4351680	the PSN store right now.
4351680	4357400	I assume that they're also available on XBL too, so what do you think about that?
4357400	4361400	That sounds hot.
4361400	4365240	Tigerclaw sent us another story, but we already talked about it, Blizzard banning Starcraft
4365240	4367840	2 cheaters.
4367840	4370840	And DarkKisuke says, wait, what?
4370840	4372620	Sexual innuendos in Orange Lounge?
4372620	4373620	No way.
4373620	4375920	Yes way, of course way, duh.
4375920	4376920	Lollipops.
4376920	4379480	Way way.
4379480	4389740	And Matt Ostrovsky, sorry if I said that wrong, Matt, sent us a story that says, story sounds
4389740	4390740	too good.
4390740	4391740	It might be a scroll.
4391740	4393080	Oh no.
4393080	4396880	Yuji Naka wants to work on the Dreamcast 2.
4396880	4397880	No.
4397880	4398880	Oh yeah.
4398880	4399880	We can dream.
4399880	4400880	We can dream.
4400880	4401880	That is wrong.
4401880	4402880	We can dream.
4402880	4403880	That's never gonna happen.
4403880	4408880	We can dream about the Dreamcast.
4408880	4409880	Waa waa.
4409880	4410880	Poor Dreamcast.
4410880	4411880	Not gonna happen.
4411880	4415400	I think one more person sent a Twitter topic.
4415400	4423000	Yes, AlphaKananagram sent us a topic about the Katamari Damacy director and his wife
4423000	4429280	starting a new company called Uvula with a low-key website.
4429280	4434440	And then rather than focusing solely on game development, the company's About Us page details
4434440	4439720	a focus on music and video games, adding that we want to widen our limit.
4439720	4440720	Okay.
4440720	4442520	Widen the limit.
4442520	4445320	So what could they do to top Noby Noby Boy?
4445320	4446320	Hmm.
4446320	4452360	But you know, I actually still play Noby Noby Boy on my iPhone.
4452360	4454160	I'm not surprised by this, actually.
4454160	4458720	He's going to eventually meet girl.
4458720	4462960	It's just like, I have no brain capacity to think of anything to do, so I'm going to play
4462960	4466040	with my little worm person.
4466040	4467040	It works.
4467040	4470160	DDR dollar bill says no Dreamcast 2 ever.
4470160	4471160	Alas.
4471160	4472160	Sadness.
4472160	4481360	Without the extra S. Shenmue 3 on Dreamcast 2, fall of 20, never ever.
4481360	4482360	Aw.
4482360	4483360	Sadness.
4483360	4489720	But yeah, that will do it for our Twitter topics this week, and if you want to have
4489720	4494320	your Twitter topics read by Rob when he is back next week, then send your Twitter topics
4494320	4499320	to Rob at at O-L-R on Twitter and he will read them, I'm sure.
4499320	4505720	Maybe we can get Rob, instead of doing a porn voice, he can invite Mr. Spanky.
4505720	4511440	Rob can do one of his voices, which always sound like Rob with kind of a high-pitched
4511440	4512440	voice.
4512440	4519840	So how about we find a few more topics to discuss?
4519840	4521560	I suppose we could.
4521560	4528240	And it's kind of interesting, apparently, of course, it's not unexpected, Sony is going
4528240	4532440	after anything that's possibly going to mod the PlayStation 3.
4532440	4538800	Of course, they went after the PS Jailbreak before, and now that that's kind of gone,
4538800	4544040	because there's free versions out there, they're now going after other things, including the
4544040	4554960	PS Groove, the kind of open source device out there, PS Freedom, and Open PS Jailbreak.
4554960	4566160	They are aiming for takedowns, I guess, apparently the website PSX Scene has found some different
4566160	4573480	things that they've marked exhibits, and they are trying to basically erase the existence
4573480	4579240	of these, not necessarily the devices, but of these programs, because the devices themselves
4579240	4588080	can be practically anything nowadays, because they've been adopting the PS Groove to practically
4588080	4589080	everything.
4589080	4600720	Everything from an iPod to a TI-84 to some old-ass MP3 players, USB development, cards,
4600720	4601720	just everything.
4601720	4606400	Unfortunately, not PSP, because they were unable to port it over to the PSP, but your
4606400	4616040	phone, iPhone, Droid, you name it, it can hack the PS3 now.
4616040	4617240	Your mom can hack a PS3.
4617240	4620640	They're going to start hack storing brains, because people are always going to think of
4620640	4621640	a way to do it.
4621640	4626080	Yeah, I mean, you can try to stop people from doing that stuff, but where there's a will,
4626080	4631520	there's a way, and if they want to hack it, they will.
4631520	4633520	Exactly.
4633520	4641960	Speaking of hack storing brains, during the Tokyo Game Show event, Q Entertainment head
4641960	4651040	Tetsuya Mizuguchi unveiled the new component of his upcoming rail shooter, Child of Eden,
4651040	4659040	and he wants participation from us, and it's for a part of the game he calls the Journey
4659040	4665160	Project, and he's seeking to build a collection of player-submitted pictures for inclusion
4665160	4669480	on the last level of the Child of Eden game.
4669480	4674740	Mizuguchi says, in this game, the player's mission is to purify everything, even data,
4674740	4680260	and this is the final stage of the game, you know, I need the beauty of memories.
4680260	4685600	So with collected memories of family, friends, and beautiful landscapes, you can get that
4685600	4687040	kind of memory with music.
4687040	4688760	It must be real.
4688760	4695400	Mizuguchi also added, I want to put everybody's credit at the end of the game, yeah.
4695400	4700280	Ubisoft clarified that images can be submitted to the official Child of Eden website through
4700280	4704440	November 20th, and any approved photos will be used in the game.
4704440	4712340	I can't even imagine what's going to be submitted by random people.
4712340	4713840	No buts in the game.
4713840	4721400	We're going to get a lot of gongoro, which would be kind of funny.
4721400	4726400	What the hell's going on out there?
4726400	4731440	Like I said, the cousins are over and they're having a fun time in the front room watching
4731440	4738760	YouTube videos of the guy singing all of the John Williams themes with his own lyrics.
4738760	4740600	Actually all about Star Wars.
4740600	4741600	Okay.
4741600	4744200	Yeah, some YouTube thing.
4744200	4745200	Wonderful.
4745200	4754080	Well, we do have a little bit of other news, at least I do, about Medal of Honor, which
4754080	4759640	for anyone who tuned into Bobby's show earlier, they know this, or they can read, but they
4759640	4767920	have decided to change the name of the multiplayer faction Taliban to Opposing Force.
4767920	4773880	Yeah, they're doing it, as I said, out of respect for those in the military and for
4773880	4781040	those who have lost family members in the war, and they're trying not to show any disrespect.
4781040	4787280	I sort of have the opinion that they already had this in mind, and this was a ploy to get
4787280	4797880	a little more publicity, but hey, if they're doing this, I mean, the name Opposing Force
4797880	4802160	is kind of unimaginative.
4802160	4803160	Generic much?
4803160	4805160	Yeah, very generic.
4805160	4813200	Because, I mean, wouldn't Opposing Force all be relative to what force you are opposing?
4813200	4818400	They could just call it bad guys, they should just go, bad guys.
4818400	4820000	Oh no, the bad guys.
4820000	4822480	Then it's offensive to people who are bad.
4822480	4823480	Oh no!
4823480	4824480	Ah!
4824480	4828000	They should just call it, red team?
4828000	4829000	Dudes.
4829000	4830000	Dudes.
4830000	4831000	Chicks.
4831000	4834640	But see, then that's just sexist right there.
4834640	4835640	Not really.
4835640	4838720	I call everyone dudes, so that's not sexist.
4838720	4843080	If you have chicks to find out in there as well, you just can't do that.
4843080	4845400	It should be dudes and blokes.
4845400	4846400	Blokes.
4846400	4847400	Blokes.
4847400	4848720	It works.
4848720	4853000	And it can be a game about fisticuffs instead of guns.
4853000	4858480	They can box each other and not punch.
4858480	4859480	I don't know.
4859480	4862040	Maybe it's a little too late, who knows.
4862040	4864960	But at least they're, they're, they're trying.
4864960	4866880	Darktads used to be just us versus them.
4866880	4870320	But I don't want to be them, I want to be us.
4870320	4872320	Oh no, I thought we were us.
4872320	4873400	I'm me.
4873400	4875400	It's me versus everybody.
4875400	4876400	Die!
4876400	4879120	Bah bah bah bah bah.
4879120	4880120	No.
4880120	4881120	Anyway.
4881120	4882120	Misty says woot blokes.
4882120	4883120	Yeah.
4883120	4887800	Alright, well there's some new music games coming out in Japan because, well, that's
4887800	4888800	what they do over there.
4888800	4890480	They release music games.
4890480	4900600	And of course, the sequel to Jubeat, Jubeat.net Append will be coming out, I guess, spring
4900600	4902840	of 2011.
4902840	4912080	And also, location tests, I guess, for XG2 are gonna be starting soon as well as Guitar
4912080	4915240	Freak's Drummania V7.
4915240	4919840	That's way too many damn games.
4919840	4923160	That'll be starting very soon.
4923160	4930000	And they haven't really said exactly when those location tests are actually gonna start.
4930000	4932440	Same with Jubeat Ripples.
4932440	4938080	That location test, sometime next year, but the only one announced so far is XG2.
4938080	4942480	Why is it called Knit?
4942480	4944760	I don't know.
4944760	4948440	Why does Konami name anything like that?
4948440	4949960	I want a knitting game.
4949960	4950960	Not really.
4950960	4952960	You can do that with the Wii.
4952960	4955280	I believe there's Crafting Mama, so.
4955280	4956280	Oh, okay.
4956280	4957280	Close enough.
4957280	4959960	I want Crochet Master.
4959960	4963400	Ooh-hoo.
4963400	4965880	You could call it Check My Hook.
4965880	4966880	Womp-womp.
4966880	4972280	To a guy who says, Fancy Nancy.
4972280	4974280	Fancy Nancy.
4974280	4976280	Knit for Fancy Nancy.
4976280	4978280	Oh, dear.
4978280	4981920	In other news- Yes, please.
4981920	4989200	Well, we all know how weird and perverted the internets can be, and so since the internets
4989200	4995440	is full of weirdos and perverts, you have to take some measures to make sure that LEGO
4995440	4999200	Universe can still be child-friendly.
4999200	5004960	And so NetDevil has recently outlined a couple of measures that they are implementing to
5004960	5012320	help protect the MMO's younger players, since it is targeted towards kids.
5012320	5017520	And basically, it includes content moderation, which is no surprise to anyone, really.
5017520	5023360	So you will have to get anything that you make, the name will have to be approved before
5023360	5027520	it will go out into the LEGO Universe world.
5027520	5033960	And the other part is a LEGO Universe ID, which is kind of- it actually sounds a lot
5033960	5040640	like Nintendo's friend code system, to where you give your LEGO Universe ID to other people
5040640	5046360	outside of the game, and then they can see your creations that you've made even before
5046360	5050120	they're approved, so.
5050120	5054800	Protecting the innocent childrens from the weirdos of the internet, yay!
5054800	5057120	And later on they will become the weirdos of the internet.
5057120	5060600	Indeed, but on their own, not without the perversion of other people.
5060600	5062800	Oh no, no, we can't have that.
5062800	5064240	Think of the children.
5064240	5067760	Think of the children and how crunchy they are.
5067760	5074480	Well, it's time for another special segment of the show, this time I will actually use
5074480	5076520	the correct music for.
5076520	5080320	It's time for the mailbag!
5080320	5086280	And I've got the rubber gloves on, it's bending its stinky self over, and I'm opening the
5086280	5089440	bag, and ugh.
5089440	5094760	This is kind of- because Rob hasn't cleaned out the spam filter like he does for me, so
5094760	5097040	there's all kinds of- Read the spam!
5097040	5100680	I don't know, read the spam, because I don't really care- there's spam in there about Lady
5100680	5103680	Gaga, I should have left it in there for Rob, but I will.
5103680	5106800	That's so Rob.
5106800	5107800	Rob loves Lady Gaga.
5107800	5111080	I have started appreciating Lady Gaga a little bit, but-
5111080	5113120	Lady Gaga is stalking me.
5113120	5114120	Really?
5114120	5120560	Ever since I sang Lady Gaga for karaoke one time, now she's following me everywhere and
5120560	5124240	she's like in my head.
5124240	5131320	Now when you start busting out the asymmetrical wigs and dresses of meat-
5131320	5135480	I don't look enough like Marilyn Manson to pull off any of Lady Gaga's looks.
5135480	5139560	She was so much prettier before she went- anyway, I'm not gonna get into that.
5139560	5140560	Greetings, O.L.R.
5140560	5145080	I come to Loki with a non-gaming question that I think he'll have a good answer for.
5145080	5146080	Ooh.
5146080	5147080	Alright.
5147080	5151600	Loki, I'm a contractor and my cell phone contract is up.
5151600	5153520	What would you recommend for me?
5153520	5158400	All I want is a family plan with no text, no data, and fifteen hundred plus minutes
5158400	5159880	of phone a month.
5159880	5163560	I've looked at the big four, didn't know if there's some weird hacker service that I'm
5163560	5164560	unaware of.
5164560	5166960	At the moment I'm leaning with T-Mobile because of price.
5166960	5169080	Loki, can you help a desperate turtle?
5169080	5172520	Your loyal turtle and Philly serious turtle.
5172520	5176440	And disclaimer, Orange Hills Radio is not paid by any of the companies that might be
5176440	5180520	mentioned and we should be even if they wanted to pay us.
5180520	5181520	I don't know.
5181520	5185120	Honestly, like I have a crap plan that didn't have any of that stuff and it's actually more
5185120	5189840	expensive than the plans to have all that stuff, so go fig there.
5189840	5191200	Just have to really kind of shop it.
5191200	5196360	There's websites and stuff that you can actually, you know, put what you need for your plan
5196360	5202080	and it will kind of shop everybody and tell you what the most affordable plan for you
5202080	5203080	is.
5203080	5207000	I can't think of the life of me what that website's called, but I know it's out there.
5207000	5208000	Google.
5208000	5210000	Well, it's not Google, it's something else.
5210000	5211800	But you can do that.
5211800	5216940	I'm planning on getting a phone through Virgin Mobile just because they're twenty-five dollars
5216940	5220700	a month for, you know, three hundred minutes because I honestly use like twelve minutes
5220700	5224080	a month if I'm lucky on my phone.
5224080	5225960	So anything cheaper than that would be awesome.
5225960	5230960	I was actually looking at a prepaid phone, but I think twenty-five dollars a month with
5230960	5233960	no contract would not be that bad.
5233960	5236820	And plus I can browse the Internet on that if I really want to.
5236820	5238760	But I'm sorry I texted you earlier.
5238760	5240060	I should give you a dollar.
5240060	5241060	I don't care.
5241060	5242060	It's all right.
5242060	5246240	Well, we've got some suggestions from the chat room.
5246240	5248920	Spazinator says to quote Monty Python, I hate spam.
5248920	5249960	And that's wrong.
5249960	5251960	It's I don't like spam!
5251960	5253440	There you go.
5253440	5254440	That's how you do it.
5254440	5258880	SSJ100Matt says T-Mobile sucks and suggests Verizon.
5258880	5260500	And Ron just suggests go with Sprint.
5260500	5261500	Great coverage.
5261500	5262500	Dirt cheap.
5262500	5266160	Virgin also because they're piggybacking on the Sprint network, so.
5266160	5267600	Spazinator uses Cricut.
5267600	5272120	I use AT&T because I have an iPhone.
5272120	5275620	And I basically use everything except the phone to call people.
5275620	5277000	I do not call people.
5277000	5278600	Only if it's necessary.
5278600	5280160	Because I hate talking on the phone.
5280160	5282240	I did it way too long for my job.
5282240	5283240	Ugh.
5283240	5288080	The only people I like talking to on the phone is like my mom.
5288080	5291120	Because she's funny and frustrating at the same time.
5291120	5293080	I'm pretty happy with Verizon myself.
5293080	5296540	They're a little bit more expensive though, but I get better coverage from them.
5296540	5301520	I have no reception for AT&T or Sprint within my house.
5301520	5304640	And I do with Verizon, so you know, can't go wrong with that.
5304640	5308120	I noticed that I didn't get as good reception in your house when I visited.
5308120	5313040	Yep, it's AT&T and Sprint both have really crappy reception inside of my house.
5313040	5316480	The AT&T is pretty good out, at least in Sacramento.
5316480	5319520	So the next email comes up from Kamitsuyo.
5319520	5322760	It says, hi everyone at OLR.
5322760	5327200	I think it's time to revisit how Rob is doing on his quest to finish three games this summer.
5327200	5328800	I haven't heard any talk of it lately.
5328800	5330880	Considering the summer's over, yeah.
5330880	5332600	That would be interesting to check out.
5332600	5334800	Well that actually goes back to another email.
5334800	5340440	Actually, no, that was the only email that we received that way.
5340440	5344680	He had like a list of games that he was going to try to beat.
5344680	5353960	And well, given that I have one of those, in fact, okay, here's the other email that
5353960	5354960	we got.
5354960	5357800	Someone else actually, oh it's the same guy, he expanded on his email.
5357800	5359680	I knew someone else had something on it.
5359680	5362160	Hey everyone at OLR, I've been listening to this show for about three years, it helps
5362160	5363920	me get through some long days at work.
5363920	5364920	Thank you.
5364920	5368360	Anyway, what I'm writing about is an episode at the beginning of the summer when Rob talked
5368360	5372560	about how he never finishes games and was dedicating himself to finish three games this
5372560	5373560	summer.
5373560	5376320	Haven't heard any progress on this or on the show lately.
5376320	5380360	He has kind of inspired me to play several games to completion, which I have done several.
5380360	5384640	Red Dead Redemption, Final Fantasy 13, Darksiders, Alan Wake, and currently working on God of
5384640	5386360	War series on PS3.
5386360	5390600	Just finished the first, along with a slew of 360 arcade games.
5390600	5394120	Love the show, keep them coming, look forward to the big 10-year anniversary marathon.
5394120	5395120	Stay black.
5395120	5396120	Kamitsuyo.
5396120	5401440	And, yeah, one of the games that Rob was supposed to finish was Final Fantasy 13, which is currently
5401440	5404880	sitting in my living room, because I'm playing it.
5404880	5410640	Of course I'm also playing the, I'm sitting down with that Avatar game finally, too.
5410640	5414800	So we'll just have to make Rob fess up next week, won't we?
5414800	5415800	Yes.
5415800	5417560	And, last email.
5417560	5419760	This is from Darkyusuke.
5419760	5423480	Just had to note, whatever that Japanese game you brought up on Twitter, I swear it was
5423480	5424480	a fucking hentai.
5424480	5427120	Go back and listen for yourself and be the judge, XD.
5427120	5430720	Hail the FSM, Darkyusuke.
5430720	5431720	And that's it for email.
5431720	5432720	Hmm.
5432720	5441200	Well, if you have any emails you want to send us, it's mailbag at orangeandreo.com.
5441200	5442200	Send it!
5442200	5445720	A couple more final stories here.
5445720	5450400	Actually, I think you have something that we need to do first.
5450400	5454160	Hold on, someone just said that the stream went down.
5454160	5457840	Although I don't think that it did, did it?
5457840	5463280	Can you hear us, internets?
5463280	5465200	This is a server's down, crap.
5465200	5466360	Hold on.
5466360	5467800	That's back online.
5467800	5468800	Is it?
5468800	5469800	Yeah.
5469800	5470800	Shoutcast is saying that it's not.
5470800	5472200	Oh, well.
5472200	5473200	Hold on.
5473200	5475840	Who crossed the streams?
5475840	5476840	That's funny.
5476840	5479560	Well, we'll just let him.
5479560	5482520	When AMP, it froze, actually.
5482520	5483520	When AMP froze.
5483520	5484520	Ah, that sucks.
5484520	5485520	Hold on.
5485520	5487520	Tara, can you hit the chat room now?
5487520	5488520	Yeah.
5488520	5489520	Thanks.
5489520	5491800	You probably want to make sure that part B saves.
5491800	5492800	Maybe.
5492800	5502520	Save it now, and we'll continue on with part three, if you will.
5502520	5504520	I need to mark this down.
5504520	5505520	3645.
5505520	5506520	Shit!
5506520	5508520	Where's my pen?
5508520	5509520	Alright.
5509520	5511520	What's up?
5511520	5525520	Are they hearing us now or something?
5525520	5528520	No, I just like Loki's comment.
5528520	5529520	And scene.
5529520	5530520	Okay.
5530520	5535520	I'm actually closing down when AMP, hold on.
5535520	5546520	I'm going to reload it.
5546520	5564520	All games radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.
5564520	5566520	Yes, we are.
5566520	5567520	Yay!
5567520	5568520	Hold on.
5568520	5571520	I've got to fix this to the right settings.
5571520	5572520	Okay.
5572520	5576520	43 encoder.
5576520	5584520	What the hell was it?
5584520	5586520	Hold on.
5586520	5588520	44 kilobyte.
5588520	5589520	96K.
5589520	5592520	And we should be back.
5592520	5593520	Are we back?
5593520	5595520	Can you hear us, internets?
5595520	5597520	Internets, are you there?
5597520	5598520	Oh, crap.
5598520	5599520	I forgot.
5599520	5600520	We can't hear them.
5600520	5603520	Alright, let us know in the chatroom if you can hear us.
5603520	5606520	We had a little bit of an issue, which should be resolved now.
5606520	5609520	And thankfully it only went down during mailbag.
5609520	5612520	And I got to admit, it is your fault, chatroom.
5612520	5613520	It really is.
5613520	5614520	It really is.
5614520	5616520	We know.
5616520	5621520	And a DDR dollar bill says, I thought the dollocks were next week.
5621520	5623520	No, no, no, no.
5623520	5626520	So yeah, from what I understand, it went down during mailbag.
5626520	5628520	So we'll make Rob edit it.
5628520	5629520	Yay!
5629520	5634520	Okay, so shall we move forward with our little podcast?
5634520	5635520	Yes.
5635520	5638520	Loki, rescue us.
5638520	5641520	Actually, you can't rescue us right now.
5641520	5643520	You know why?
5643520	5645520	It's at the use of the week.
5645520	5650520	Just in time for the stream to go down, huh?
5650520	5652520	Timing is impeccable.
5652520	5653520	Yes, it is.
5653520	5675520	My F.U. of the week goes to the stream for going down while I was busy paying attention
5675520	5677520	to other things.
5677520	5680520	And for Rob going to Club 33 without me.
5680520	5681520	Bitch.
5681520	5684520	Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
5684520	5685520	Loki.
5685520	5691520	F.U. to my headache that I've had for two days now.
5691520	5693520	And it just won't go away.
5693520	5695520	It's lack of sleep, really.
5695520	5699520	But I've been trying to get sleep and just can't.
5699520	5701520	You have a small person.
5701520	5703520	Well, it's not even, yeah.
5703520	5705520	It's a little bit him.
5705520	5707520	Actually, it's all him.
5707520	5711520	So, yeah, it's been very tiring to say the least.
5711520	5713520	And, yeah.
5713520	5715520	So that's F.U. to that.
5715520	5716520	F.U. to the crappy drivers.
5716520	5722520	I literally saw somebody pass somebody on the right within the same lane on my way here.
5722520	5724520	And I was just like, really?
5724520	5725520	Really?
5725520	5726520	You just did that?
5726520	5730520	You're in that much of a hurry that you need to pass somebody in the same lane on the wrong
5730520	5731520	side?
5731520	5732520	Awesome.
5732520	5733520	Thank you.
5733520	5735520	And F.U. to scammers.
5735520	5742520	By the way, that brings us to our favorite, well, my new favorite topic, which is shoutouts
5742520	5746520	to people on AOL Instant Messenger.
5746520	5750520	In fact, we have somebody that you probably should give a shoutout to and let them know
5750520	5752520	that they should really do the right thing.
5752520	5759520	And that person would be PimpinTyler146 on AOL Instant Messenger.
5759520	5763520	I will be posting his name in the chatroom and Twitter.
5763520	5768520	Be sure to give him a nice little hi because he is a douchebag that didn't come through
5768520	5771520	on his end of the transaction.
5771520	5775520	So, I'm sure he'd love to hear from all of you.
5775520	5778520	Tara, do you have any F.U.s?
5778520	5779520	Yes, I do.
5779520	5780520	F.U. to my work.
5780520	5785520	Because not only am I working my normal shift, which is 9 to 6, not bad.
5785520	5791520	But I'm also now working these extra days where I'm working until midnight or 1 a.m.
5791520	5798520	And it's really messing up my sleep schedule and they don't want to pay me overtime.
5798520	5801520	And on next Sunday I get to work from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.
5801520	5807520	And that really, really sucks and I did not sign on for this and so F.U. my work.
5807520	5811520	Don't they have to pay you overtime if you work more than a certain amount of hours?
5811520	5813520	No, because I'm salary.
5813520	5816520	Oh, that sucks.
5816520	5818520	But they don't want to give me any incentives either.
5818520	5822520	They just want to do this stuff and it's like this is not part of my job description.
5822520	5825520	So, it's very upsetting.
5825520	5832520	Well, that sucks. I hope there's some improvement soon.
5832520	5842520	Well, now that the F.U.s are over and we're full of angst that we have now released onto the unsuspecting internet,
5842520	5845520	Loki, do you have another story for us?
5845520	5847520	Of course I do.
5847520	5852520	And it's funny since you mentioned release.
5852520	5858520	There is going to be a brand new peripheral coming to the Nintendo Wii remote.
5858520	5865520	Unfortunately it is not something that is, say, approved by Nintendo.
5865520	5869520	Or even something that you would, say, use with a Nintendo game.
5869520	5872520	We've covered this.
5872520	5876520	Yes, but they finally actually are going to be releasing them now.
5876520	5884520	But these are Nintendo Wii remote accessories that are kind of...
5884520	5887520	They're for dildonics basically.
5887520	5891520	It's two different peripherals to use.
5891520	5897520	And what the main function of this, obviously, is actually for chatting over the web.
5897520	5902520	They're using the Wii remotes as kind of a Bluetooth adapter so that these things can vibrate.
5902520	5909520	And you can remotely vibrate them across the web using, I guess, different programs.
5909520	5914520	It's the Mojo Wejo is what it's actually called, the company.
5914520	5923520	And I believe that they said they're going to be supporting a bunch of different chat applications.
5923520	5927520	And I'm sure their own chat application as well.
5927520	5928520	Is that what they're calling it these days?
5928520	5934520	In the beta stage right now, but it'll be available for purchase in time for holiday season 2010.
5934520	5937520	God, I would not want to be part of that beta test.
5937520	5940520	I had to link a copy of that image in the chat room,
5940520	5945520	but I think it's funny that there's a whole YouTube video describing how it's supposed to be used.
5945520	5948520	It's intensely hilarious.
5948520	5950520	Indeed.
5950520	5954520	Intensely hilarious.
5954520	5958520	I don't know. Even the name is just too ridiculous for me.
5958520	5960520	Mojo Wejo.
5960520	5965520	Mojo Wejo. See, even porn voice doesn't make Mojo Wejo sound good.
5965520	5969520	No, it doesn't. And your porn voice is excellent.
5969520	5970520	Thank you.
5970520	5971520	You're welcome.
5971520	5985520	Moving on, away from the porns, former Sega man Yuji Naka is working on an action game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 with Prope.
5985520	5991520	And he hasn't revealed what the game is yet, but he will soon.
5991520	6003520	So according to Naka, they are doing a few quite big action game projects at Prope, but he didn't tell us anything about them.
6003520	6010520	He did say that a very original action game based in the sky will be revealed within this month.
6010520	6013520	So that's something to look forward to.
6013520	6016520	I hope it has airships. Yay, airships!
6016520	6019520	I wonder if it's going to be Skies of Arcadia.
6019520	6021520	Ooh, maybe.
6021520	6022520	Could be.
6022520	6025520	It's based in the sky and it involves airships.
6025520	6027520	Indeed.
6027520	6033520	Well, we will know soon according to Naka-san, right?
6033520	6038520	Yes, soon. Within this month, they are going to tell us about his project.
6038520	6045520	Well, that should hopefully be cool. I don't think Yuji Naka's done anything that's really sucked that bad.
6045520	6057520	So, now it is time for a special part of the show where you, the caller, get to come and speak to us if we can get it to work.
6057520	6060520	So I'm going to go ahead and make this disclaimer right now.
6060520	6070520	Because we do have Tiara in through Skype, I'm going to try to get these to work as a conference call so we don't have to disconnect on her.
6070520	6079520	So, I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now and go ahead and make your calls.
6079520	6081520	I'm not going to play any music.
6081520	6085520	Call!
6085520	6087520	Ah, yes.
6087520	6091520	This is while we do the waiting game. Hi, Dan!
6091520	6093520	Riveting.
6093520	6095520	It is riveting.
6095520	6101520	Hey, we got a call. I'm going to answer.
6101520	6105520	Hello, you're talking to Orange Lounge Radio. Who is this?
6105520	6107520	This is DJ Blaziken.
6107520	6111520	Hi, DJ Blaziken. How are you?
6111520	6118520	I'm doing fine and I just found a solution for all DSI owners that might be listening in.
6118520	6127520	I found this out through the internet and through the grace of it because I don't know if any of you guys have had this problem,
6127520	6133520	but I have and I'm sure there might be a few others that might have had this.
6133520	6143520	The L and R buttons becoming not able to be fixed when hit and you'd have to end up coming through mashing them in.
6143520	6151520	Well, but the thing is, the little gap that lets it go down is basically letting dust in.
6151520	6157520	Basically, best bet, take a little mini vac or whatever you have to suck the dirt out and do exactly that.
6157520	6164520	It's supposed to, actually it's made my DS work again. Fully functional again.
6164520	6172520	Well, thank you for sharing the tip with us. I'm glad it's worked for you. I'm sure other people have had similar issues.
6172520	6181520	Yeah, and other than that, my original DS, well the second DS that I've ever owned,
6181520	6190520	started to completely fail on me and ended up spending, well going broke really on a new DS Lite
6190520	6193520	and it was actually the last one in the batch, but it was well worth it.
6193520	6203520	With Pokemon HeartGold, which is kind of a, I don't know, basically just HeartGold with the crystal and yellow features
6203520	6206520	sort of slapped into it with new DS graphics.
6206520	6211520	Well, that's pretty cool, but I'll tell you what, we're getting other calls in, so I need to go ahead and let you go.
6211520	6212520	Thank you for calling.
6212520	6214520	Otherwise, I do give it a 10 out of 10.
6214520	6217520	Okay, thank you for calling. Bye bye.
6217520	6223520	Shut up. I think that was DS Master.
6223520	6229520	And I am super professional. Oscar says I'm super professional. Let's make sure that we haven't,
6229520	6238520	I'm gonna see if I can't get Marin off of, off of, are you there?
6238520	6239520	Yes, I am.
6239520	6242520	Okay, so this is what we're gonna do now for future calls.
6242520	6249520	I want people to, um, I'm gonna add the conference. Aha! It worked.
6249520	6253520	Hello, who are we talking to?
6253520	6258520	Quark, anyway, hello you, across the ocean.
6258520	6261520	Hello, AK Ripper, how are you?
6261520	6265520	I'm doing just fine on this Monday morning.
6265520	6267520	And we do have Tara on the line still too.
6267520	6271520	Monday morning? Are you from the future?
6271520	6275520	No, I just live in this place called Sweden.
6275520	6277520	Ooh, Sweden.
6277520	6282520	Where I'm all like, I'm like, well, what is it? I'm eight hours ahead of you.
6282520	6284520	That means you are from the future.
6284520	6287520	You are from the future.
6287520	6289520	What's the future like?
6289520	6291520	Our future is Swedish.
6291520	6294520	Are there flying cars? Tell us, I must know.
6294520	6298520	No, no, nothing of that yet. Unfortunately.
6298520	6303520	But since you're in Sweden, you have awesome chocolate, right?
6303520	6309520	Um, no, I don't, no, no, no, no, you're thinking of like Switzerland or...
6309520	6314520	What does Sweden have that's awesome? Tell us about Sweden.
6314520	6319520	What do we have that's awesome? Well, we, ahem...
6319520	6326520	Oh, that's like, we have, what do we have? Well...
6326520	6327520	Damn!
6327520	6328520	Prostitution?
6328520	6329520	Oh, okay.
6329520	6331520	No, no, no, no, that's legal actually.
6331520	6333520	Hot hookers!
6333520	6334520	No, no, that's legal.
6334520	6336520	We have prostitution in Las Vegas.
6336520	6337520	No, that's Amsterdam, sorry.
6337520	6338520	Oh, whatever.
6338520	6341520	But anyways, what's on your mind, dude?
6341520	6349520	Oh, well, ahem, what do I call? Oh, well, something of some sort.
6349520	6351520	Crap.
6351520	6356520	Oh, yeah, you forgot to talk about something.
6356520	6362520	Dragon Age Ultimate Edition is coming, is coming soon.
6362520	6366520	Well, somewhere around December or something.
6366520	6370520	And, well, the funny thing is that I've just been reminded.
6370520	6374520	I did buy Dragon Age on launch day and I haven't played it.
6374520	6379520	The reason I've just been reminded is that I play it on a PC and...
6379520	6385520	Funny story is that my computer that I play it on, you can unlock it.
6385520	6391520	You can unlock all the four cores since two of them is disabled by default of sorts.
6391520	6396520	And that makes Dragon Age load up pretty fast.
6396520	6403520	But then the two cores was really faulty, so I had to disable them.
6403520	6412520	And then I was like, I don't want to play this slow loading game, so I'm going to play it when I have a quad core.
6412520	6417520	And I still don't have a quad core, so I'm just going to wait even more.
6417520	6423520	I think you should just suck it up and play the game, because Dragon Age Origins is an awesome game.
6423520	6426520	It's the best game ever and you're really missing out.
6426520	6433520	See, you have Dragon Age Origins in Sweden, that's what you have, but you're neglecting it.
6433520	6443520	Well, to be honest, I'm playing that thing called Sims 3 and I'm eagerly waiting nightlife.
6443520	6448520	Yeah, that's going to be fun. I'm probably going to get it well after everybody else has had it.
6448520	6454520	The chatroom also would like to inform us that Sweden has Ikea.
6454520	6463520	Yeah, but the part where I live in Sweden, we don't.
6463520	6475520	We have it, but I have to go like, well, what is it? 250 kilometers or something?
6475520	6476520	That's a distance.
6476520	6477520	Yes, it is.
6477520	6481520	We've also been informed about Roxette, Ace of Base, and Abba.
6481520	6487520	So, since Sweden has lots of stuff, how come you don't know this?
6487520	6498520	Well, because I'm like one of those, in some way, uneducated bastards that lives in a cave of sorts.
6498520	6500520	That's okay, you're like the rest of us.
6500520	6509520	Where we live in our caves called our computer rooms and don't come out except when we need to eat and go to the bathroom.
6509520	6514520	Yeah, that's one up on this one, too.
6514520	6524520	So, I have a challenge for you. By the end of the month, you must start Dragon Age Origins.
6524520	6526520	Yes, that is the challenge.
6526520	6548520	Well, in one way, I've been reminded. I have played a few of the origin stories, and then afterwards I just get bored by some strange reason.
6548520	6552520	So, you have gamer ADD?
6552520	6557520	Yeah, well, and I actually have real ADD, too.
6557520	6559520	That would contribute.
6559520	6562520	If we ought to go that way.
6562520	6564520	That would contribute.
6564520	6567520	Well, AkiRipper, I appreciate the call.
6567520	6570520	Are we doing okay without Rob?
6570520	6586520	Yeah, you're doing just fine. Because, well, in some way I would say, more of this in the future, please, even though it's like, sorry, Rob, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.
6586520	6591520	Yeah, that's the way in. Yeah, something.
6591520	6596520	I don't know, I'm just this worthless foreigner of whatever.
6596520	6603520	Oh, you are not a worthless foreigner, we adore you. But we need to go ahead and let you go, we've got another call coming in, okay?
6603520	6604520	Yeah, later.
6604520	6605520	Take care.
6605520	6608520	Bye-bye.
6608520	6613520	Hello, caller. You are on Orange Jones Radio. Who be thee?
6613520	6616520	I be DDR Dollar Bill.
6616520	6617520	Hi.
6617520	6621520	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill. What's on your mind?
6621520	6631520	Oh, not much. I just want to give an update about the PlayStation 3 that I got a couple weeks back, that I finally purchased it.
6631520	6632520	Yay!
6632520	6633520	Yeah.
6633520	6634520	Congrats.
6634520	6635520	What's that?
6635520	6637520	I said congrats.
6637520	6645520	Oh, thanks, thanks. It's, it makes a nice little, it's, it's a lot better to watch DVDs on that, to give you that much.
6645520	6650520	But the move, I didn't like it at all.
6650520	6658520	I found out that you asked for me, I actually have to be about six feet away from the TV, and unfortunately, I don't have that much room in my apartment.
6658520	6660520	Oh, that sucks.
6660520	6670520	Yeah, so, I mean, I went forward, and it would, it stopped detecting, and I was only like maybe four feet away from the screen, and I said, uh, no, this is not gonna work.
6670520	6675520	Is there any way that you could wall-mount, like, a receptor or something?
6675520	6676520	I have, well...
6676520	6680520	I think you should mount it onto your ceiling.
6680520	6684520	That's at least six feet away. Right?
6684520	6688520	I'd have to lay down on the floor to do that, though.
6688520	6690520	I'd be laying on the floor waving my stick.
6690520	6692520	Wait, that doesn't look right at all.
6692520	6696520	Well, then...
6696520	6709520	Yeah, but, uh, just wanna save that, and I've got a lot of enjoyment out of it for one big reason. No fucking batteries on the controllers.
6709520	6716520	It was such a play, I enjoyed just actually plugging the controllers, get it going. Alright, we got multiplayer.
6716520	6718520	That's always a plus.
6718520	6728520	Yeah, so, so let's, oh, hold on a second. There we go, I'm sorry, I was hearing myself repeat myself.
6728520	6730520	You had to do what to yourself?
6730520	6734520	No, I was hearing my voice come in an echo, I was like, why?
6734520	6739520	Maybe, maybe you've got your, you're too close to your speakers or something to that effect?
6739520	6742520	You have to be at least six feet away.
6742520	6747520	You must be at least six feet away to enjoy this podcast.
6747520	6754520	Yeah, so, the biggest hits so far in the household is LittleBigPlanet and ModNation Racers.
6754520	6759520	How do you like ModNation Racers? I've been meaning to play that.
6759520	6764520	Okay, before we go into it, I'm gonna say this again, this is just a disclaimer.
6764520	6770520	I thought Super Mario Kart on the SNES was the biggest piece of shit that ever existed.
6770520	6777520	I'm sorry, I thought the controls sucked horribly and the perspective just, I couldn't play it.
6777520	6781520	I had to wait till the N64 version just to even be able to play it.
6781520	6786520	But for ModNation, what I loved about it is that anybody could pick it up.
6786520	6790520	Anybody could pick up and guide us to the game right away.
6790520	6795520	Well, that's always a plus with a game. I think that if it's a game that's that simple to play,
6795520	6798520	then it's definitely better to get more people in on it too.
6798520	6807520	Oh, exactly. Especially when they can't just design their own characters and cars and even tracks.
6807520	6813520	When they start doing the tracks, that's gonna be a lot more fun because we can just recreate anything we want.
6813520	6818520	Especially around New York, we got no shortage of tracks to replicate.
6818520	6822520	So, I need to ask you something. As a dude, I have to ask you this.
6822520	6829520	What is it about being able to customize your characters? Isn't that a lot like Barbie dolls for dudes?
6829520	6836520	Like, okay. When we have all these wrestling games and my husband would try to make the wrestlers look all cool and stuff,
6836520	6839520	I'm like, dude, it's like you're playing dress up.
6839520	6841520	It really is.
6841520	6845520	In essence, you're half way right. It is kind of like doing Barbie.
6845520	6847520	But it's manly Barbie.
6847520	6849520	And wrestling is like soap opera for dudes.
6849520	6851520	It is.
6851520	6854520	Oh, no disagreements.
6854520	6858520	Oh, they got her drunk and they got married. Oh no.
6858520	6860520	Triple H. Sorry.
6863520	6866520	Look, I'm coming back from the dead again.
6866520	6871520	Oh, now it's the under biker.
6871520	6877520	No, he's back to Undertaker, like the dead guy again. He was a biker for a while though.
6877520	6881520	The under biker was. Now we're on wrestling, sorry.
6881520	6884520	It's alright. He lost tonight anyway.
6884520	6887520	Oh, really? It's been that long. I'm like, I don't know who any of these people are anymore.
6887520	6891520	That's terrible that they wrote that into the script, that he would lose.
6891520	6894520	He lost by getting hit with the urn.
6894520	6896520	What?
6896520	6899520	They wrote that all back in there. They're going way back.
6899520	6901520	Wow.
6901520	6903520	They went backwards.
6903520	6909520	Given that I remember playing WrestleMania in the arcade, and you could choose the Undertaker.
6909520	6912520	When I was a kid.
6912520	6914520	Oh, yeah.
6914520	6916520	The under biker needs to retire.
6916520	6919520	You're not the only one who's saying that.
6919520	6930520	Well, anyway, thank you for clearing this up for me because I've always wondered if it's just the same sort of little giddy joy in making them look pretty.
6930520	6933520	Like pretty, pretty ponies.
6933520	6939520	Just to add to it, in the wrestling games, it's also a joy now where you can actually create your own finisher.
6939520	6943520	So now it's not just, ooh, you look pretty. Like, ooh, I can kick your ass pretty.
6943520	6948520	That's... I've never heard someone say, I can kick your ass pretty.
6948520	6951520	I don't know. Just a moment of thought.
6951520	6955520	Did you ever play WrestleMania 2000 on Nintendo 64?
6955520	6957520	Yes.
6957520	6963520	We made this guy who was part of G Generation X and we would just put him on watch mode and he beat everybody.
6963520	6969520	He won every belt, including the women's belt.
6969520	6974520	Oh, gosh. When the AI was actually that easily manipulative. Nice.
6974520	6979520	Exactly. Anyway, this isn't wrestling chat. This is Orange on Radio.
6979520	6982520	Agreed. Video games, but...
6982520	6984520	Are you sure about that?
6984520	6987520	We talked about food in part A. We did already get our food out of our system.
6987520	6992520	That sounds bad. That's more like what we do during the break is get our food out of our system.
6992520	6995520	Speaking of which, I got my pizza here to eat too.
6995520	6998520	Why don't we let you get to your pizza?
6998520	7000520	What kind of pizza do you have?
7000520	7001520	Take care.
7001520	7003520	Alright, you too. Bye.
7003520	7005520	Bye bye.
7005520	7008520	Ah, pizza and wrestling.
7008520	7012520	So reminds me of my early years with my husband.
7012520	7014520	How romantic.
7014520	7021520	Well, you know how we got engaged was watching UHF and drinking Manischewitz wine, which should have set a precedence there.
7021520	7024520	Yep.
7024520	7030520	So do we have any other callers? Because if you don't, I'm closing the line and you're all SOL.
7030520	7032520	Five, four...
7032520	7035520	Misty is supposed to call. Call Misty.
7035520	7045520	Misty, call. You must call. You must call. Or we'll call you. Conferencing you in in just about a minute. Are you on?
7045520	7050520	Ooh, she's sneaky.
7050520	7053520	I do not see her in the list of people who are on the lines.
7053520	7056520	Aww.
7056520	7060520	Oh, there we go. Let's see.
7060520	7063520	Nope, I do not see a Misty.
7063520	7065520	Call us.
7065520	7067520	Call us.
7067520	7071520	Oh, we got another one in, but it's not Misty. Let's see who this is.
7071520	7077520	Hello, you're on Orange Jones Radio. Who are you whoring yourself out today?
7077520	7081520	I'm whoring myself to whoever has the highest amount of money for me.
7081520	7083520	Oh baby, oh baby.
7083520	7084520	Hi Rhonda.
7084520	7086520	Hey, hey, what's up?
7086520	7088520	Hi Ron-Chan.
7088520	7091520	My Ron-Chan, oh hi.
7091520	7093520	Let me see what you did there.
7093520	7095520	No, I do try.
7095520	7097520	How are you doing today?
7097520	7107520	I am doing good. Would you believe I just finished, I just finished editing my podcast to get it and it's...
7107520	7110520	Huh?
7110520	7112520	Did you cut it out?
7112520	7115520	Oh, here we go. Sorry about that. I hit the mute button by accident.
7115520	7123520	Remember, don't hit the mute button. Never hit the mute button because then you'll end up sounding like this while you're trying to talk.
7123520	7126520	No, and we can't have that now.
7126520	7128520	No.
7128520	7139520	Just finished editing our podcast and it just went up blind and I'm looking at all the emails of all the gaming demos that's going on at New York Anime Festival slash Comic Con this weekend.
7139520	7142520	Ooh, do tell.
7142520	7147520	Okay, first email I got is from the people behind DC Universe.
7147520	7150520	Ooh.
7150520	7157520	And which is also interesting, the Marvel Superhero MMO will be playable as well.
7157520	7159520	Yay.
7159520	7165520	I'm looking at a graphic of it. It's pretty much, it's the Marvel Superhero Squad online game. Looks interesting.
7165520	7169520	Oh, that's cute. That should be adorable.
7169520	7175520	Definitely. And I also got an email from Sega so they'll be showing up on the new Thor game.
7175520	7177520	Oh, cool.
7177520	7185520	And I am curious about DC Online because this will be the second time I've ever played a PS3 in my entire life.
7185520	7186520	Really?
7186520	7193520	Yeah, first time I played it was at some gaming con. I played around with Street Fighter IV. Only thing that annoyed me was the load time.
7193520	7195520	Yeah.
7195520	7198520	I much prefer that on Xbox.
7198520	7205520	It's funny though, I only bought Street Fighter IV only because I know the person that does the voice of Ryu in the game.
7205520	7206520	Really?
7206520	7208520	Yes.
7208520	7212520	Who is it? I mean, what other stuff has he done that I would recognize?
7212520	7217520	His name is Kyle Hebert, and did you ever watch the dub Dragon Ball Z?
7217520	7220520	I tried not to, but I have it sometimes.
7220520	7222520	He did the voice of adult Gohan.
7222520	7223520	Oh.
7223520	7224520	Oh, okay.
7224520	7226520	He was actually one of the ones that wasn't annoying.
7226520	7228520	Mm-hmm.
7228520	7233520	Of the very few that were not annoying, he was one of them.
7233520	7234520	Yeah.
7234520	7245520	He wasn't the older adult Gohan when Viz and Pioneer dubbed it. He was part of the Funimation cast when they redubbed the series.
7245520	7253520	Yeah, I think I pieced it together when you said it because I remembered Ryu's English voice.
7253520	7262520	Okay, and that end, I don't remember how many episodes they dubbed it before Funimation took over. It's just like a giant blur to me.
7262520	7264520	Dragon Ball Z is a giant blur to me.
7264520	7276520	Well, with Dragon Ball Kai, which is supposed to be more of the manga-based version, or I like to call it Dragon Ball Z Kai, less filler refs, still tastes great.
7276520	7278520	That's pretty funny.
7278520	7283520	So the battle with Cell only takes like five episodes instead of 73?
7283520	7286520	Pretty much. Pretty much.
7286520	7298520	Seriously, when I had my fan subs of the Cell episodes, they were seriously over four VHS tapes at whatever the long play was. SLP.
7298520	7300520	Wow.
7300520	7302520	Yeah. That's way too much.
7302520	7325520	I remember the first time I watched the fans of Dragon Ball Z. Me and my cousin were at his grandmother's house watching it, and it was third or fourth generation VHS tape because as we're watching it, the video quality was so bad that it would just flip to blue screen every three minutes, and we're just sitting there glued to the TV, watching every single minute of it.
7325520	7329520	That sounds like my first experience is watching Ranma 1-1-2.
7329520	7337520	When my first copies were fan subs from the Ranma project, about four, five generations old.
7337520	7347520	I remember that. I remember there was this comic book shop I used to periodically hang out at, and they actually had the fan sub copies.
7347520	7354520	But the thing is, I liked the price of these often. It was like two episodes for like 20 bucks. I'm like, nah, that can stay on the shelf.
7354520	7358520	I remember the old days when you traded fan subs.
7358520	7360520	I remember that.
7360520	7362520	Ah, memories.
7362520	7364520	I still have all my fan subs in storage.
7364520	7366520	Now we download them off the internet.
7366520	7372520	Shh, shh, don't say that. We're not supposed to.
7372520	7375520	How else am I gonna get my Digimon fix?
7375520	7377520	Well, did you know they actually-
7377520	7379520	I'm watching the new series of Digimon.
7379520	7381520	Do you know they actually re-fan subbed on Digimon?
7381520	7384520	Uh, don't know.
7384520	7386520	Eh.
7386520	7388520	Don't get me started.
7388520	7390520	So how about more video games?
7390520	7392520	I do butterfly, the opening theme.
7392520	7395520	How about more video games? What else is gonna be up there?
7395520	7399520	That's basically it. That's all the information I have here.
7399520	7404520	Also, there's another company called Game Tech that's supposed to be there.
7404520	7412520	They're probably doing these little flash-based games or something like that. That's my assumption.
7412520	7414520	They're not saying too much about it.
7414520	7420520	They're gonna be the Kenshiya Hall of your convention.
7420520	7433520	To be perfectly honest, the Kenshiya Hall of Comic Con is like the little room in the back where it's open gaming and then people try to get up on stage and make fools of themselves.
7433520	7438520	That's always the best part of cons, is people making fools of themselves. In costume!
7438520	7440520	Oh, I'll definitely be in costume.
7440520	7441520	So what's your cosplay this year?
7441520	7452520	Speaking of in costume, I am looking for pieces for a River Song cosplay from the end of the last Doctor Who series.
7452520	7459520	So if you know somebody who can help me out with finding some pieces for that, I would be much appreciative.
7459520	7468520	I'm probably the minority in my group that does not watch Doctor Who, only because I have so much stuff on my plate to watch I have no time for it.
7468520	7471520	Tisk, tisk, tisk.
7471520	7476520	Hey, if it helps, I watched some of the original stuff from the 60s and the 70s.
7476520	7478520	That's what I grew up on.
7478520	7480520	Yeah, on public access.
7480520	7482520	Fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.
7482520	7499520	Okay, well if Ron Chan can't help me, somebody on the interwebs that is hearing this, the tens of people who listen to this show, there are a lot, so if you would like to help me out with some River Song cosplay so that I can go to the Laguna Beach Comic Con.
7499520	7503520	Is that the one? No, I'm going to Long Beach Comic Con at the end of this month, so...
7503520	7506520	In the old home of Onomatopoeia Expo.
7506520	7507520	Yes.
7507520	7517520	Oh, I remember that place, and I remember walking all over that section of Long Beach in four inch platform heels. Not fun.
7517520	7518520	Not smart.
7518520	7519520	No, but I was cosplaying.
7519520	7521520	Kinda sexy.
7521520	7525520	But for the record, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary.
7525520	7526520	Okay.
7526520	7527520	Ah.
7527520	7533520	Hence the boots and walking around in wings in a crowded dealer's room. Not smart. I didn't do it again.
7533520	7543520	Well, Tiara, I can't say this much, but I actually do know a couple of people out in the Vegas area that are cosplayers, so I may be able to cash in a favor or two.
7543520	7555520	Um, if one of them is somebody that I think it is, that might be a creepy person from high school that I went to high school with, so maybe not.
7555520	7557520	Male or female?
7557520	7558520	Male.
7558520	7563520	You're in luck, they're all females. Most of the cosplayers I know and commissioners are female, so you're good.
7563520	7565520	Okay, good. Okay, good.
7565520	7568520	I got you, I got you.
7568520	7570520	No creeps for you today.
7570520	7573520	Yay, one day creep free.
7573520	7576520	Except when DS Master called in.
7576520	7580520	Well, I missed that call, so...
7580520	7582520	That's right, you were on hold.
7582520	7583520	Yep.
7583520	7589520	Well, Ron-Chan, thank you for your call, and you need to get your ass back out here soon.
7589520	7596520	As soon as I get some cash monies, me and Joe there and Missy will come out there and invade for a weekend or two or three.
7596520	7600520	Or everybody compile and get me out there, because I don't want to be in California.
7600520	7602520	Yeah, I want to go to New York.
7602520	7606520	Yeah, we need to make the Send Jamie and Tiara to New York fund.
7606520	7615520	Yeah, and DDR dollar bill said I should ship myself there, but I don't know how many air holes I would need, so I'm not sure if that would work.
7615520	7616520	Thirty-two.
7616520	7617520	Thirty-two, okay.
7617520	7625520	Not to mention that they put you in one of those non-compressed compartments and you'll freeze to death, so that's not good.
7625520	7627520	Yeah, that would kind of suck.
7627520	7629520	Oh hey, Loki, when did you show up?
7629520	7630520	Oh, I've been here.
7630520	7631520	Oh, okay.
7631520	7634520	He's been looking up porn and playing the magical unicorn fart game.
7634520	7637520	I've been doing either of those, but yes.
7637520	7641520	That would explain why the stream went out. Bad Loki. Bad Loki.
7641520	7644520	No, it went out from spam overload from the email.
7644520	7646520	Eat.
7646520	7647520	Yeah.
7647520	7650520	So, do you have anything else for us?
7650520	7653520	Give us more.
7653520	7655520	No, that's pretty much it, yeah.
7655520	7660520	Alright, well we are going to let you go. Reluctantly, reluctantly.
7660520	7661520	We love the mall.
7661520	7664520	So, take care, and thank you for calling in.
7664520	7665520	Will do.
7665520	7666520	Anytime.
7666520	7667520	You are fantabulous.
7667520	7668520	Bye-bye.
7668520	7669520	Bye.
7669520	7683520	Okay, I think that we're about called out. I'm going to leave room for one more call, and if not, then we'll go ahead and ask for any last-minute stories and wrap the show up in ribbons and bows and call it pretty.
7683520	7685520	Yay, so pretty.
7685520	7689520	Shadowrunner says someone should cosplay Billy Mitchell.
7689520	7701520	You know what, all that makes me do is when I hear the scout doing the slap shop commercial.
7701520	7704520	Hold on, somebody fill time.
7704520	7706520	Time fill, woo.
7706520	7709520	Oh, I know. It's Misty's birthday, so.
7709520	7710520	We should say happy birthday to Misty.
7710520	7719520	Happy birthday, Misty. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Misty, happy birthday to you.
7719520	7724520	Yay, now send us cake. Fresh, fresh cake.
7724520	7726520	Yes, cake. Or cupcakes.
7726520	7728520	I love cupcakes.
7728520	7729520	Me too.
7729520	7735520	Oh, wait, wait, wait, Rama's telling everyone to tell Jevdea to call in and do coffee talk.
7735520	7739520	Coffee talk with Jamie and Tiara.
7739520	7745520	Give us a call, we'll talk. No big whoop.
7745520	7749520	That Madonna is such a skank.
7749520	7752520	That was my favorite coffee talk.
7752520	7757520	With Madonna and Roseanne Barr and then Barbara showed up.
7757520	7760520	Because she's like, butta.
7760520	7767520	Okay, I'm still trying to find this, hold on.
7767520	7770520	I can't find it. Where is it?
7770520	7775520	Shadowrunner says the cake is a lie, but pie is constant. This is true.
7775520	7777520	That is true.
7777520	7781520	Pie is constant.
7781520	7783520	I can't spell today.
7783520	7786520	Well, last minute stories, I guess.
7786520	7787520	Yes, please.
7787520	7791520	Retailers are apparently listing Duke Nukem Forever for February 1st.
7791520	7797520	I can tell you right now that's just an estimate because they haven't really given up the exact release date yet.
7797520	7801520	I'm assuming it's February, though, because we have it listed in February as well.
7801520	7805520	But not the 1st, because that would be wrong.
7805520	7810520	Well, here, I've loaded this up. Oh, we've got another call coming in, hold on.
7810520	7812520	Let me add them to our call.
7812520	7816520	Hello, you're calling in Orange Falls Radio. Who is this?
7816520	7818520	This is Jevdea.
7818520	7820520	Hi!
7820520	7822520	Hello!
7822520	7826520	You've called! Now we can talk!
7826520	7831520	We can talk, so we can have...
7831520	7833520	We can discuss.
7833520	7835520	We can hasing.
7841520	7844520	So how are you?
7844520	7847520	I'm well. My nose hurts.
7847520	7850520	Why did your nose hurt?
7850520	7853520	I pierced my system.
7853520	7855520	Fun!
7855520	7859520	That sounds about as fun as putting a hole in your face.
7859520	7862520	Something like that.
7862520	7866520	Why did you go and do a silly thing like this?
7866520	7871520	I had the time and I had the money.
7871520	7874520	If you've got the time and money, you should just come out here!
7874520	7876520	Exactly.
7876520	7877520	No!
7877520	7879520	It's less painful!
7879520	7885520	I was on a weekend vacation at a barbecue competition thing.
7885520	7889520	It was at the beach, so I did it.
7889520	7894520	It's the weekend that's not being able to go out to California.
7894520	7897520	Everybody else put holes in their noses with you, too?
7897520	7899520	Oh, I guess you did.
7899520	7903520	So, what's going on on your gaming front?
7903520	7908520	I'm actually trying to play through the Lego games again.
7908520	7910520	Oh, yay!
7910520	7913520	I'm trying to play through Batman now.
7913520	7916520	Lego Batman is so much fun. I love that game.
7916520	7918520	It absolutely is.
7918520	7921520	No! I'm having so much fun with it.
7921520	7925520	And it's just absolutely ridiculous.
7925520	7929520	It's fantastic, innocent fun.
7929520	7932520	I think Lego Indiana Jones is still my favorite, though.
7932520	7935520	But I have a soft spot for Indy.
7935520	7938520	Even though he's old and walking around with a cane.
7938520	7941520	Yeah, I had that for the DS.
7941520	7943520	And I liked it on DS.
7943520	7946520	I had Batman for the DS, too, and I played that like crazy.
7946520	7949520	So now I'm just trying to get through everything on the 360.
7949520	7951520	Did you play through Arkham Asylum?
7951520	7955520	No, I haven't. I do not have it.
7955520	7959520	I'm trying to wait for it to come down in price and find it down at price.
7959520	7962520	If I can find it cheap, I will send you a copy.
7962520	7963520	$39.99.
7963520	7966520	If I can find it cheap and use it somewhere, I will find you a copy.
7966520	7968520	Okay.
7968520	7970520	It's really worthwhile.
7970520	7976520	In fact, I think I saw it at one of our local used music and game stores
7976520	7981520	for like 20, I want to say.
7981520	7984520	We'll work out something after the show. You can PayPal me.
7984520	7987520	Okay. All right. That sounds good.
7987520	7990520	Even though I still have to send a sound board to Tiara.
7990520	7992520	Oops.
7992520	7995520	I still have stuff to mail you, too, so it's okay.
7995520	7998520	And you only sound vaguely Atlantean.
7998520	8000520	Yes.
8000520	8006520	Well, I totally suggest the Arkham Asylum game. It's pretty fun.
8006520	8008520	You can also just go around.
8008520	8012520	The best thing to do in that game is to get up on the gargoyle heads in some of these areas
8012520	8016520	and then drop down behind people upside down all crazy-like.
8016520	8019520	You pick them up and beat the crap out of them and drop them down.
8019520	8021520	It's just awesome badminton.
8021520	8022520	It sounds fun.
8022520	8023520	I know.
8023520	8025520	See, that's the kind of stuff that I do in Metal Gear.
8025520	8028520	I just go up behind people and just strengthen them.
8028520	8030520	Snap their necks.
8030520	8032520	See, now in my head I've got Rob's voice going,
8032520	8034520	LOL, you're dead.
8034520	8039520	That's the kind of crap that I do in video games, though.
8039520	8040520	I like that stuff.
8040520	8042520	You like the ninja.
8042520	8044520	Yes. Yes.
8044520	8047520	I think that makes me a little violent, though, but that's okay.
8047520	8050520	Oh, there's nothing wrong with that. You have to blow off steam somehow.
8050520	8053520	Yeah, exactly.
8053520	8055520	So I do it on video games.
8055520	8058520	And two people. And nice one did that.
8058520	8061520	Because we know the difference between gaming and reality.
8061520	8064520	And as much as we imagine doing it to people in real life,
8064520	8067520	we do not actually do it.
8067520	8071520	No, we just wish that the video games were real sometimes.
8071520	8074520	DDRdollarBill says, remind me not to piss her off ever
8074520	8079520	and doesn't want to have this next snap silently.
8079520	8082520	Yes, let's not do that for reals.
8082520	8087520	Or what was the line in Silence Good, but let's play Metal Gear for real.
8087520	8096520	Alright. Well, do you have anything else that you wish to discuss with us?
8096520	8100520	No, I was just calling in to say hi, basically.
8100520	8102520	Well, hello. We're glad that you called.
8102520	8104520	Yes, indeed.
8104520	8105520	I hope so.
8105520	8107520	Batman!
8107520	8109520	She's Batman.
8109520	8112520	She's Batman.
8112520	8116520	Well, you take care, and we will end it on Batman.
8116520	8117520	Batman!
8117520	8120520	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na phone call!
8120520	8123520	Okay.
8123520	8127520	Okay, that's it for Skype.
8127520	8133520	I'm going to go ahead and go on the Do Not Disturb.
8133520	8136520	Because I will not answer any more of your insolent questions.
8136520	8138520	Do Not Disturb.
8138520	8143520	I will no longer respond to your insolence.
8143520	8145520	I'm done. Do you have any more last minute stories for us, Loki?
8145520	8147520	No.
8147520	8149520	Tiara, do you have any last minute stories?
8149520	8151520	I do not.
8151520	8153520	So how about last minute thoughts?
8153520	8155520	Wait, last thoughts. Loki, any final?
8155520	8158520	My head hurts. Baby's sleeping right now.
8158520	8160520	And that means he's going to be up at night.
8160520	8165520	My head hurts even more knowing that I have to get up at probably 3 in the morning this time.
8165520	8169520	Time to break out the Vicodin.
8169520	8172520	I can't swallow pills, so that doesn't work.
8172520	8175520	We'll put it on your pizza.
8175520	8177520	I already ate all the pizza.
8177520	8179520	Vicopizza.
8179520	8182520	And Tiara, for you, any last minute thoughts?
8182520	8185520	Happy Spocktober, everyone!
8185520	8189520	That makes me all warm and fuzzy and logical.
8189520	8192520	And my final thought is...
8192520	8195520	Taco Salad defeated!
8195520	8197520	Dun dun dun!
8197520	8199520	Alright, everybody.
8199520	8205520	Well, that's been this episode of Orange Lounge Radio's Sans Rob, who never did make an appearance.
8205520	8208520	How dare he not make an appearance.
