14116	25281	Tonight, October 3rd, 2010, NBA Jam goes solo on the 360 and PS3, Sonic 4 gets a release date, and if big titles this year save the PC gaming industry?
32765	36046	Hello everybody, this is episode, what are we on again? 283.
38036	42940	283 of Orange Lounge Radio I'm sorry, 384 I totally threw out a random number there That's kind of funny, huh?
43500	54550	Yeah, 283 We went back in time Rob's gone and the show has become the TARDIS And we have run back in time You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio I got two of the numbers right, though They were just out of order
55563	58004	Yes, an OLRG, yes, Spazinator.
58924	60884	I am DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61545	63925	Rob is on a plane.
64045	64305	Dead.
65566	66146	Or dead.
67086	71047	And then this is Loki, our tech master.
71727	73808	Do you do any tech stuff lately with us?
75988	83230	I stole a cord the other day out of the box because I need it for something new in the home, but other than that, no.
83666	84526	Mar and Marvel Video Games
115149	118691	So, why don't we go ahead and start with you for how was your gaming week?
119831	122052	My gaming week was alright.
122692	123873	I played a lot of WoW.
124073	127554	I've gotten back into World of Warcraft after not playing for a long time.
128655	130616	And other than that, pretty uneventful.
130876	137418	I played some, I like the music games like the Lips and the Beatles rock band, so I did some of those.
137518	143341	And I've been trying to play Final Fantasy IV The After Years, which came out around this time last year on the Wii.
144219	161553	and I had started playing it and I just like dropped off the face of the earth and so I started playing it again and now I'm at a point where I'm seriously underleveled for the area I'm at so I'm going to have to go do my least favorite thing which is grinding and leveling up.
162674	167918	That was always the thing that I could not stand in World of Warcraft just because it seemed really monotonous to me.
168819	169760	Yeah there is that too.
171058	171599	Tiara, Mar and Marvel
193607	197408	Sky, and Loki, and DarkSakura.
197929	198789	We'll make you famous.
199429	199769	Yeah.
200070	200770	Yay!
200790	203931	This is all sounding very dirty.
205151	206472	We have ways to make you famous.
208873	210453	Now we've got you outnumbered.
210493	211494	It's estrogen time.
212037	214058	Yeah, dun-da-dun!
214458	217019	It was always estrogen time here with Robs.
219279	221420	He's gonna go back and edit this and go, what?
222640	224241	Although it's the truth.
224721	226502	Okay, well then, Loki, how was your gaming week?
227322	233364	Actually, I didn't play a whole lot, but I did play some stuff on the iPod and
235020	239202	I don't know, a lot of it was just disappointing because I go on these binges where I buy a lot of junk.
239242	247085	Well, not even necessarily buy a lot of junk, but I download a lot of apps and that includes a lot of games, especially stuff that's on sale.
247726	256770	So I went ahead and I downloaded, because it was free, Duke Nukem 3D for the iPod or iPhone or whatever.
258010	262112	The only problem is I deleted it almost immediately because the controls in it really suck.
262252	269314	Otherwise, it's Duke Nukem 3D and it's pretty awesome, but it's just the controls really suck, so what's the point?
270335	271955	Of course, more Plants vs. Zombies.
272755	273556	That was a lot of fun.
273596	282119	I also played a little bit of the newly released Bit.Trip beat on the iPod, and...
282899	293742	The only thing I don't like about that game, and it was kind of the same way when it was on the Wii, where everything, you had to kind of tilt the controller to move your paddle up and down.
294142	301544	Well, you had to tilt the iPod to move your paddle up and down, and I really think it would have been a lot better if you could just use the touchscreen to move your finger up and down the screen.
301564	305325	It would be a lot more accurate, and it can ramp up the difficulty or something like that, because...
306385	306606	and so on.
325018	327260	I gotta admit, that game was actually kind of fun.
327600	330842	And it kind of reminds me of the old iToyPlay games.
331242	333864	And you may be thinking, oh, iToyPlay, that's going to be crap.
334204	343070	Well, actually, what's kind of cool about it is the fact that with the camera now and the motion controllers, you can actually do a lot of the augmented reality stuff.
343130	348794	So, for example, most of the games actually in that use augmented reality controls.
348874	350595	So you'll have your...
351676	352656	Thanks for watching!
370402	376505	They had a little, I guess, round in the game where it kind of switches up games really quick, kind of like WarioWare.
377105	378306	And it was actually quite fun.
378486	383988	So I might actually check out the full version of that if, you know, it would be a good party game or something.
384548	386009	That and, of course, more sports champions.
386329	388130	Play a little bit of that demo as well.
388150	394072	Because I still haven't actually gone out to buy any full version move games yet because I just don't...
395253	395513	DarkSakura,
412813	413453	Dead Rising 2, Halo Reach
430552	430872	That's it.
458044	461549	Ow, that hurt!
461830	469001	There's this one part right before you go to fight, was it Ridley or one of the... Craig.
470752	471353	Craig, sorry.
471393	471733	Craig.
472573	472933	I don't know.
472993	474374	I was thinking of school.
474394	474734	Craig.
474915	475475	No, Craig.
476035	477676	Craig, that's the wrong game.
477876	479477	That's in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which we did play.
479497	480638	I know, I know it is.
480678	481598	Which we did play.
482039	483019	But I'll get to that next.
483640	489303	But there's this one part where this person's like dead and covered in bugs and the bugs fly off and Rob's like, LOL, you're dead.
490404	491124	Which I thought was funny.
491604	499729	And then Rob left and we played Turtles in Time on the SNES and we beat the game because Dan and I are an awesome team.
500393	502553	So Shredder did not dine on turtle soup?
503094	504354	No, but he kept talking about it.
504434	506494	I'm like, dude, don't you have any original lines or something?
507435	520737	And so, yesterday I went to play, just because we had to go ahead and go buy this really crappy arcade, I stopped to play Parapara Paradise, which is the first Mix Plus.
521818	522878	And it was pretty fun.
522978	527459	I actually remembered how to do three of them off the top of my head and did a decent job and
529241	558651	of course I had four songs to play so I just redid Night of Fire because Night of Fire is fun and then came home and I've played some Sims and mostly it's just been little bits of gaming except for Tuesday night because I've had school work and other stuff to do so that's been my gaming week more eventful than usual but not as not really all that busy my gaming week will be busier soon once Fable 3 comes out because I totally pre-ordered that this weekend ooh
560120	561201	Are you going to yell at the dog?
563081	566283	Already for Dance Masters when it comes out since you've been playing some Parapara.
566823	568504	That's all that game really is anyways.
569044	569905	Or not Dance Masters.
573726	574527	No, it is Dance Masters.
574567	575127	Dance Masters, yeah.
575147	575507	That's right.
575567	576988	Because there's Dance Central as the other one.
578468	580609	I wonder if there's going to be actual Parapara in it.
580850	581230	It is.
581550	582550	That's what the moves are.
582590	583451	They're Parapara.
583471	586132	They had Night of Fire on there and it's the exact same thing.
586532	587312	I'm totally getting this.
587553	588233	Dan, we're getting this.
589671	590352	He's over at my desk.
590372	592113	You have to get the Kinect, though, and that's expensive.
592393	592973	Yeah, that's true.
593013	593753	But I am getting that.
594034	597375	And I actually probably will pick up this game just for fun, because it's funny.
599397	601298	Dan's over there saying that he's sure that we'll have it.
602518	617627	So as for some general housekeeping, like we've been mentioning, Rob is on a giant cylinder defying the laws of gravity, although he is making good use of the laws of propulsion and aerodynamics.
619139	620159	So, way to go, Rob.
620720	623401	He's probably up there asleep or playing his Game Boy or something.
625301	628503	That being said, Rob will probably not be here the entire episode.
628643	630564	Or if he's here, it will be towards the end.
631264	632644	And I'm not making any promises.
633405	637586	Also... Which is why we're going to do this episode really quick so that it doesn't happen.
639767	642848	But we do have the lovely Tiara with us tonight.
643248	646910	Who is always welcome to be on the show if she ever gets in town again.
647901	648583	Yeah, I know.
648983	650747	I gotta save up some vacation time.
652511	659445	Well, that being said, why don't we hop right into the news headfirst and get ready for some decontamination afterwards.
660566	660846	Yes.
661747	667931	So the big news this week, of course, Nintendo had their own little press conference not to be outdone by Tokyo Game Show.
668692	671854	And, of course, everything Nintendo was covered by.
671874	672875	Bitch, we're Nintendo.
673235	673695	Exactly.
674135	675016	They can do what they want.
676337	677778	We're not coming to your conference.
677978	679779	We have our own conference.
680019	680640	And you can't come.
681260	686324	So they talked, of course, the 3DS, because that's going to be the big release for them next year.
687584	688985	Lots of details coming out about it.
689766	696209	Of course, it is going to be coming out in February for a lot of money.
696629	702612	Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to exactly be that expensive when it comes out over here.
702932	706474	But over there, it is quite expensive.
706494	710136	25,000 yen, which is the equivalent of about 300 USD.
712478	734495	and it'll be out in aqua blue and cosmos black so that's interesting February 26, 2011 is the actual date they're saying that the estimates in the other regions it's supposed to come out around before the end of the first quarter so probably during their fiscal year
736381	758341	Uh, so anyways, so that's, uh, coming out then, and some other details, of course, um, came out about it as well, since, you know, they covered everything Uh, what it'll actually come with when you buy it, it's gonna have, of course, uh, the AC adapter, but what's kinda neat, though, is it has a charging stand Um, so you don't have to buy one of those third-party things, you just slap it right in there
758801	762443	And by the way, when it's sitting in the charging stand, it kind of looks like a little puppy.
762663	765244	So that's kind of weird with the two cameras on there.
766024	766744	It's a cute little puppy.
767285	768545	Oh, that is cute.
768885	780370	Of course, the touch pen and a 2GB SD card, as well as six augmented reality cards, as well as instruction booklets and all that fun stuff.
780410	780710	And I guess...
781090	786713	There's actually going to be a built-in augmented reality game that you can play using the 3DS cameras.
787254	789255	So that'll be kind of neat.
789275	791916	I wonder if PictoChat's still in there, because that'd be fun.
793377	796019	And of course, other fun stuff that's going to be available.
796519	800741	You will be able to, of course, download games to the console as well.
800781	807825	They're going to have the ability to import games that you've downloaded from your DSi or DSi XL into the 3DS.
809487	830625	also they're going to have a brand new virtual console that's going to cover Game Boy and Game Boy Color games so that'll be out there at some point and other fun things of course they're going to be having a web browser that actually works this time it's not just some cheap ass web browser that they're going to
831085	832045	Tackon later on.
832505	835186	It's actually going to have flash support in it, I believe.
836146	847808	And they're going to also have kind of a tag mode as well where you can walk around and it'll automatically exchange data with other machines and you won't have to just manually turn it on.
848809	856870	And some other things that they're talking about with that is possibly doing firmware updates using that tag mode.
857450	860191	So kind of a way to
861892	863352	Make sure everybody's not pirating.
863913	870616	I was reading about that, but it also seems to me that all it would take would be one simple hardware hack.
871116	872517	Well, you could just also turn it off.
875959	877139	That's really worked well for the PSP.
879346	885253	Yeah, well, they don't have any sort of tag mode with the PSP, but you can always turn that stuff off.
886795	895106	You might want to turn it off, say, if you're playing at home, because that's going to use up a lot of your battery just with the Wi-Fi on all the time.
896207	896307	Um...
897228	900671	So yeah, so that's what's coming out at least for the 3DS stuff.
901011	904293	I'm sure a big list of games that they were talking about.
904313	905894	I mean, everything that you can imagine.
905914	907876	I think they even had video of a bunch of different things.
909197	914100	The new Zelda remakes, Mario Kart looks awesome.
914781	918463	A lot more games we'll be talking about a little bit later, but very exciting stuff.
919844	926029	Well, now you were saying earlier when Bobby called us that you expected to have a lower price point.
926946	927646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
959361	964404	Yeah, so we'll just have to wait and see when more information comes out about that stuff.
964484	968247	And once we get closer to the launch, it'll be here before you know it.
968647	969267	Reckon so.
969848	971549	Well, Tiara, do you have any news for us?
972309	973030	Yes, I do.
973270	977252	Especially if you like blue hedgehogs, because... They're crunchy.
977773	978073	Yes.
978633	979193	Wait, what?
979734	979854	Oh.
981275	984877	Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 is coming out this month.
985809	991393	and there are going to be a lot of different release dates for different platforms.
992054	998638	It's coming out on October 7th for iPhone and iPod Touch through the iTunes App Store.
999519	1004542	You can also get it through the Wii Shop channel on October 11th for 1500 Wii Points.
1005803	1009626	Xbox Live Arcade, it'll be available October 13th for 1200 Microsoft Points or $15.00.
1013311	1022877	And on October 12th, you can get it on the PlayStation Network for about 13 euros or 10 pounds, which I believe is something like a million dollars US or 15.
1022997	1026780	It's 14.99 actually, but our exchange rate kind of sucks.
1028186	1029267	That's putting it mildly.
1031028	1035993	I was actually watching a video of Sonic 4 in action, and it looks like it's a lot of fun.
1036013	1040576	I like the updated look to it, but still the cool 2D style play.
1040937	1041497	It looks fun.
1041717	1042478	I gotta be honest.
1042798	1043779	I have this.
1044239	1044740	I've played it.
1045320	1045861	I didn't like it.
1046421	1047001	No way!
1069173	1071755	So, that might be a good thing for people that like Sonic.
1071915	1074778	It's more of the same, but I thought it was terrible.
1075438	1081223	So, that's my opinion, but this is coming from someone that doesn't really care for Sonic the Hedgehog.
1081383	1086467	Well, one thing, now, I did watch someone play through the minecart level, and it looks incredibly annoying.
1087188	1092452	However, I do like the little air dashes in there, where you can target the enemies and dash at them.
1092912	1094634	That was my favorite thing in Sonic Adventure.
1095454	1096255	So, I'm glad that's in there.
1096275	1098637	I mean, that seems to me like it's enough of an innovation.
1100080	1100420	I don't know.
1101061	1104463	We'll see what it is when it comes out for those of us who don't already have it.
1105023	1111068	Yeah, I think the appeal of stuff like this is definitely that it's like the old Sonic games.
1111108	1115731	You know, it's still 2D and it's still, I mean, the graphics are a bit shinier, but it's got that
1116226	1120769	Big nostalgia factor for people who are like, like, I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog as a kid.
1120849	1125992	So it's like, oh, wow, Sonic, I want to play this just to kind of relive those memories.
1126652	1127853	That's a lot of it here with me.
1128013	1131295	I mean, if they don't, you know, don't change what's not broken, right?
1131895	1132376	Exactly.
1132556	1132756	Yeah.
1133877	1139280	Well, in other news, oh, Bungie, they've done it again.
1140543	1147290	They have banned 15,000 Halo Reach cheaters and are still looking for more to ban.
1148671	1149913	Not technically cheating.
1149953	1152295	They just found a glitch in the game and exploited it.
1152575	1153436	Hey, my story, dude.
1155018	1155258	Anyway.
1156820	1159803	What they did, it was called network manipulation.
1160383	1160624	They...
1162288	1175253	were going in, they found an exploit in the challenge, in one of the challenge levels where you could complete it 20 and more times and then keep disconnecting yourself.
1176014	1181956	Or I like as the bungee rep said, intentional network manipulation to make it sound like it was something other than pulling out the cord.
1183800	1212667	so they were able to find every one of these so they've just gone and done a blanket ban and what happened with the ban itself is that they've actually banned them for 24 hours and removed all of the credits that they earned and so they won't be able to get any more TigerClaw in chat points out that it's still cheating if you exploit a glitch which I think is true I agree
1213800	1214120	I agree.
1231796	1233517	HaloMakers, patch your damn game and fix it.
1256161	1256622	Well, they are.
1258665	1261951	And it wasn't really anything I don't think that affected a lot of people.
1262131	1265978	It was just credits to buy crap for your characters.
1267520	1269023	I don't even see what the big deal is.
1271405	1300255	it's getting free credits to get free stuff in the end but then again, I can see it both ways they're especially trying to maintain some level of fairness in the game and definitely replayability the more you play it, the more you have to earn the points the proper way but one thing I would like to point out is that Halo Reach earned $200 million in its first 24 hours so that's the biggest Xbox game ever
1301752	1301952	StarCraft
1321055	1321355	Thank you.
1321515	1323617	Because Bungie's not the only people banning.
1323797	1324858	Oh, Blizzard's doing it too.
1325098	1325818	Yeah.
1326038	1329340	Blizzard hit up 5,000 StarCraft II cheaters.
1331202	1338787	They actually, for people who hacked and modded their game, they were, they've been permanently banned.
1339627	1345291	And I think they're still on the hunt for more people, but for right now, nope, sorry.
1346292	1347492	You cheat, you lose, bye.
1347512	1349334	Okay, thanks, bye.
1349674	1349934	Flush.
1352483	1353480	They're getting serious on it.
1354147	1354367	Yes.
1356168	1367473	Literally only a week away of its release, NBA Elite 11, the reboot, if you will, of the NBA Live franchise, has been delayed to 2011.
1369433	1381278	With it, of course, was the opportunity to get a free copy of NBA Jam, which was only going to be available originally through the purchase of NBA Elite 11, at least if you wanted it on PS3 or Xbox 360.
1384381	1399341	of course they haven't announced when they're going to ship it yet but apparently they're going to be shipping NBA Jam as a standalone product on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in time for the holidays and they haven't said exactly when
1400783	1401143	and DarkSakura.
1430278	1437001	It's kind of funny because that just makes NBA 2K11 the only choice for basketball, at least in October.
1438282	1440883	You can go outside and play some real basketball.
1441263	1442083	That would work too.
1442724	1443384	I'm just saying.
1444485	1447386	No, but then they'll fall and skin their knees.
1450588	1461892	I'm actually kind of good at basketball, but I'm very klutzy, so I always am jamming a finger or getting hit in the face with a basketball or something.
1461952	1467954	So yeah, the video game versions are very much safer than actual real life sports.
1468214	1469635	You're not NBA jamming your finger?
1472676	1473957	I mean, I dig NBA Jam.
1473997	1479902	I think that's probably a game I'd be interested in at least versus NBA Elite.
1480262	1487108	But you got to ask yourself, Elite 11 must have been really fucked up if they got to delay it to next year.
1487669	1490551	I mean, was there some serious problems with that game?
1491012	1496336	Obviously, no one seems to be really kind of asking them, so why was the game delayed anyways?
1497665	1500407	Licensed NBA star here wanted more money for said likeness.
1500687	1508872	There is a rumor, though, that it was done because there was somebody, I guess, that was selling a disc on eBay for the PlayStation 3 version.
1508912	1510393	I'm not sure if that was a demo disc or what.
1510934	1515377	But at least there was some sort of disc pressed for NBA Elite 11.
1518217	1518818	Thanks for watching!
1534409	1536691	No pun intended For the record mine was fully intended
1558402	1558702	I don't know.
1558882	1561062	But yeah, looking forward to NBA Jam.
1561223	1562743	Hope there's lots of presidents in there.
1563243	1564003	Hope Clinton's in there.
1564103	1565023	Of course, Obama.
1565263	1565763	That'd be funny.
1566203	1570024	I think it'd be cool if you could play as Sarah, what's her face?
1570404	1570844	Sarah Palin?
1571024	1572144	Yeah.
1572324	1573845	I'd usually try to put her out of my head.
1574185	1579746	But like, I'm just picturing now like specialized quotes for different political figures.
1579786	1580346	It would be funny.
1580366	1582966	Like hers would be, Hey, I can see Russia from up there.
1584547	1585987	I can see Russia from the court.
1588410	1590331	But anyways, moving on.
1590632	1591232	Yes, please.
1592213	1602460	Since Loki was talking about the 3DS release details, that wasn't all that was talked about during this whole Nintendo conference.
1604481	1610546	Mistwalker's last story was actually given a release date, and it's going to be out on January 27th.
1611903	1619684	But not only that, there's going to be a couple of Wii sequels that they announced at the Nintendo conference.
1619904	1624425	And one is for the Game Boy Advance slash DS.
1624925	1626086	And that's Rhythm Heaven.
1626426	1627986	And I actually did not like that game.
1628066	1632447	I played the first Rhythm Heaven, and yeah, I thought it kind of sucked.
1633067	1633527	It did.
1633907	1634167	Yeah.
1635147	1638868	So I don't know why that's exciting news, but it's there, you know.
1638888	1638968	Yeah.
1640012	1647697	and the other one is a sequel to the Zero series which is known here as Fatal Frame.
1648858	1650158	Ooh, Fatal Frame is awesome.
1650579	1651800	Yeah, that's kind of a cool game.
1651920	1654541	That's more exciting than Rhythm Heaven, I think.
1655582	1657643	The creep factor is definitely with that one.
1658764	1659004	Yeah.
1661065	1663887	Are you... Am I going to pick up Fatal Frame?
1664107	1664267	No.
1665528	1665988	I want to.
1666209	1666709	I think I am.
1666920	1668240	They already had a Fatal Frame game over here.
1668280	1670081	I just... I don't really care.
1670101	1671021	It was alright.
1672142	1673402	I still need to buy Cho Aniki.
1673422	1676823	Which has nothing to do with Fatal Frame.
1676843	1678964	I don't know if you need to buy that.
1681464	1681744	Okay.
1682585	1684805	It's probably not that good.
1685626	1686206	Oh, come on.
1686706	1688967	It's muscle-bound men flying around shooting things.
1690427	1691207	My mistake.
1691287	1693628	I guess that must be awesome then.
1694278	1695099	It is awesome.
1695259	1696880	It's laughable and awesome.
1697881	1698221	Indeed.
1698702	1698962	Yeah.
1699883	1705868	Well, now, moving on to another front, PC gaming.
1706949	1712573	It's been speculated that the PC gaming market is on a serious decline.
1712813	1714855	And, yeah, we've seen a lot of it.
1714895	1719119	Some of the major franchises just haven't been there or have been turning towards the consoles.
1719639	1722241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1746257	1746658	StarCraft2
1762293	1764155	These are actually pulling in a lot more of the money.
1764195	1771982	Now other titles that are contributing to this too is definitely The Sims 3 because they keep bringing out more and more expansions to that.
1772322	1776846	And I think Steam has the right idea with bringing out more and more PC games.
1777907	1782631	But as far as those in particular, they are exclusively PC developed.
1782651	1786735	They're ones that are definitely trying to keep that whole element of gaming alive.
1787335	1789257	And do you think that they're going to be enough to keep it going?
1792156	1795542	I don't even know if PC gaming is really dead.
1795602	1798867	I mean, it's just... Well, it didn't say dead, just on the decline.
1799068	1799749	On the decline?
1799849	1801091	I don't even know if that's true.
1801131	1801351	I mean...
1803044	1807207	If anything, I know digital distribution seems to work the best on PC.
1809749	1819115	I don't think... I mean, it's definitely easier sometimes on consoles because you don't have to worry about having the specs to play a game.
1819876	1821757	It's just, you know, it works or it doesn't.
1824799	1825140	I don't know.
1825160	1832505	I don't know if I agree with the statement that it's... I mean, I'm sure it helped because they're big selling games, but...
1833991	1839915	There will always be something else that comes out that will be a big selling game in the PC world.
1842236	1846799	Civ V got a 91 on Metacritic, which is pretty nice.
1848923	1864029	and Starcraft 2 was a 3 million 3 million copies have been sold already so that's pretty crazy and it got a 93 on Metacritic so I don't know I don't
1865009	1875737	I think in some respects, if you look at it in a financial sense, as far as games that come out that just aren't selling very well, then I think that that's where the decline can be seen.
1875757	1881381	Not necessarily in the people that enjoy the gaming themselves, but just in the games that have come out and how well they sell.
1881481	1884643	But these two have clearly turned that around, if that was the case.
1885003	1885243	Yeah.
1885984	1887265	And then, of course, we've got our MMOs.
1888666	1889526	Always going to be addicts.
1890267	1890687	Right, Tara?
1891408	1891868	Indeed.
1891888	1892008	Indeed.
1893498	1898860	For me, there are some MMOs that I can't play because I am on a Mac.
1898960	1901641	Star Trek Online is completely out for me.
1903022	1908083	My friend who also owns a Mac has StarCraft II and he has incredible problems with it.
1908144	1910104	It's not as stable.
1911545	1917667	For me, it's harder to play quote-unquote PC games because I don't own a PC, I own a Mac.
1918444	1923407	Well, now, Steam, though, does have a Mac client now with a good number of games.
1923427	1923988	Yeah, that's true.
1924868	1928611	That is true, and I actually have downloaded a couple of games through Steam.
1929732	1946583	And so, actually, you know, that has opened up the door to me to buy more games, but it's just a lot more difficult, especially if you don't, you know, if you want to go out and you just want to play a game right away and it's not available, it's like, well, I guess I'll just get the console version then.
1948595	1950656	Ranma is suggesting desktop parallels.
1952516	1961298	I don't like Windows and I don't want to put Boot Camp or anything else on my Mac to run Windows in order to play games.
1964298	1967639	That's about what it's going to be like when I have my full Linux box.
1968739	1975881	One cool thing about Linux though is that it will run multiple environments fairly smoothly if you have the computer with the processing power for it.
1977996	1982163	I think that Linux users probably have the best of all those worlds.
1983826	1984988	I would agree with that.
1985048	1987653	Linux is a good OS and it's
1988103	1990324	Pretty stable, and it's better than Windows.
1990464	1991784	That's all I can say about that.
1993985	1998246	Linux Mint now is in its final production version, so that's pretty cool.
1998566	2000667	But this isn't Linux Chat.
2001727	2002287	It's not?
2002627	2002907	No.
2003387	2006868	It's Orange Foodio, where I'm enjoying a delicious taco salad.
2007589	2008189	Nom nom nom.
2009622	2014467	So now that we've had our mention of food and Linux, how about some release dates?
2015328	2019853	I feel sick since we were talking about food and Linux, mainly just about Linux.
2021994	2024375	I got a sandwich and I thought it would be good, but it's not.
2024455	2032476	Apparently this local grocery store over here, Rayleigh's, they have these mega subs now and they have like you can put two different meats and stuff on it.
2032557	2034197	Normally I just get like a turkey and cheese and stuff.
2034757	2037538	But I figured, hey, two different meats, so I better pick two different meats.
2037618	2039798	Two different cheeses, I guess I better pick two different cheeses.
2039838	2044259	So I have like a turkey, cheddar, provolone, and salami sandwich.
2046920	2048780	Not as good as I would have hoped.
2048840	2050681	The salami's too sweet.
2051661	2052922	My mic is steady.
2052942	2054682	Okay, you were cutting out just a little bit.
2054702	2055783	Did you give me the crappy mic?
2055843	2057704	I thought I didn't give you the crappy mic.
2070100	2070760	Well, thank you.
2073301	2075342	Lots of stuff coming out this week, of course.
2075842	2079003	The delay of FIFA Soccer 2011 on the Wii.
2079223	2084124	It came out a week later than the rest, so poor, poor Wii people had to wait an additional week.
2084684	2088305	Pokemon Ranger Guardian Signs on the Nintendo DS.
2089026	2091046	Yay, Pokemon!
2091066	2093287	Pokemans, let us show you them.
2093766	2095868	Hollywood Squares on the Nintendo Wii.
2096869	2098731	Yes, because those games never get old.
2100212	2103095	The Sports Collection from Ubisoft.
2103375	2105757	Could we get a more generic name for that?
2105877	2110742	Seriously, that's just some sports games, I guess, on the DS.
2111582	2114385	Who wants to be a millionaire on the Wii and DS?
2116747	2118328	I hope Regis is still in that.
2119268	2124769	Enslaved Odyssey to the West coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 this week.
2124789	2126970	It's supposed to be a pretty awesome action RPG.
2128751	2129871	Lilith's Pet Shop.
2130791	2131931	Got lots of games for that.
2132512	2137273	Lilith's Pet Shop, Biggest Stars Blue, Biggest Stars Pink, and Biggest Stars Purple.
2137793	2139994	And... Yeah.
2140474	2142234	Gotta purchase all three, I guess.
2142995	2144055	Because they're that awesome.
2144884	2149234	Wait till you start buying blues clues and all the kid titles for your little boy when he's older.
2150570	2151491	Uh, no.
2151951	2154492	For one, they don't make those on DS.
2154712	2157173	It's really just Dora or Go Diego Go.
2158214	2160735	Or, uh, Niha, uh, Kylan.
2161735	2164577	Um, no, I will not be buying that crap.
2166018	2169239	He will have more sophisticated tastes than that.
2169259	2170139	I mean, come on.
2171100	2173081	He's like, you know, I want the Dora to explore a game.
2173141	2174221	No, you want some Mario Kart.
2174682	2175042	That's it.
2175342	2177323	Here you go, you shoot the hooker.
2179554	2183575	Hey, I can mod a game of Grand Theft Auto that's not as violent.
2186356	2187116	I have that ability.
2188456	2189857	Ben 10 Ultimate Alien.
2190397	2196219	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP this week.
2196879	2201500	Def Jam Rapstar coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
2201680	2203921	Also with the version with the microphone.
2204421	2208122	It is the, I guess, karaoke revolution of the rap world.
2209782	2212405	and it must be hardcore because it's got Def Jam in front of it.
2213287	2216831	NBA 2K11, now the only NBA game coming out this year.
2217131	2218313	Well, the only...
2220041	2222283	Simulation NBA game coming out this year.
2222903	2229528	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii.
2229688	2232971	Yes, more kids games as you were mentioning before.
2233031	2234872	Stuff I could purchase for my son later on.
2235232	2237274	Freddy Fish ABC Under the Sea.
2237834	2239635	That's definitely for little kids.
2240456	2244359	Pets Fantasy Sunshine Magic and Moonlight Magic.
2245470	2246871	Those are on DS as well.
2247651	2249332	Castlevania Lords of Shadow.
2250012	2254794	The Castlevania game that's not really Castlevania but has Castlevania in the title just to sell more copies.
2255194	2259975	And that is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week as well.
2261996	2268119	Ah, the epic award-winning I Love Puppies for Nintendo DS.
2268599	2270000	And it's neither of those two.
2270060	2272881	It's just another puppy game where you raise puppies and do stuff.
2272901	2274462	But don't you love puppies, Loki?
2274562	2275562	Puppies are great!
2275602	2279124	Puppies are fine, but I'm not going to buy another game with puppies in it.
2280044	2281044	I learned the first time.
2281084	2281805	Thank you, Nintendo.
2282725	2284847	Vampire Moon, The Mystery of the Hidden Sun.
2285008	2286870	It's a vampire adventure game.
2286930	2287450	Yay!
2287530	2291395	It was probably one of those hidden picture games, and I guess that's fine.
2292116	2300204	Rapala Pro Bass Fishing 2010, the bundles version of that, with your wireless fishing rod, so you can...
2301949	2302970	I don't know.
2303311	2304852	Live out your white trash fantasies?
2304892	2305193	I don't know.
2306634	2308637	Way of the... That's a re-release.
2309398	2311059	If I ever saw one, Way of the Samurai 3.
2311720	2312321	It's already been out.
2312341	2313903	I'm not going to even mention that again.
2315885	2316005	Um...
2317987	2320729	Final Fantasy The Four Heroes of Light on Nintendo DS.
2320769	2321950	That's actually a pretty good release.
2322050	2323691	Yay.
2324852	2325693	I agree with Ranma.
2325753	2327074	He says fuck all these puppy games.
2327134	2328235	I want a kitty game, damn it.
2329636	2330216	Okay, listen.
2330276	2332218	They are going to have kitty games coming out.
2332238	2335280	In fact, I know there's one coming out.
2336201	2338723	But you're going to have to live with the puppy game for right now.
2339463	2340404	How about a monkey game?
2340644	2342547	They've already had a monkey game.
2343107	2344128	There's been a ferret game too.
2344148	2345810	There's been a Pets Monkeys game.
2345850	2349234	In fact, there's two Pets Monkeys games and they were terrible.
2349975	2352357	You dressed up monkeys in little outfits and stuff.
2352377	2353599	That's fantastic.
2353619	2355721	That sounds like the most amazing thing ever.
2355961	2357123	I only remember what
2357763	2374228	there was some TV show where there's these people that couldn't have children or something they're really old people and they ended up dressing up monkeys like children and would take them out in like baby carriages and stuff like that it's very very disturbing and you can still get that game so that you know alright Tiara we need to go get pets monkeys
2375037	2376358	Yes, I agree with that statement.
2376378	2377219	Dress up our monkeys.
2377539	2377939	Yes.
2378620	2380821	John Daly's Pro Stroke Golf on PlayStation 3.
2380881	2382082	Pro Stroke.
2382443	2384464	Pro Stroke, yes.
2384904	2386225	He's not just an amateur stroke.
2386306	2388727	He can stroke it like a pro.
2388807	2390769	That is coming out on PlayStation 3.
2391109	2394632	It does support the PlayStation Move for one-to-one stroking.
2395813	2408523	and then this is I think a leftover from last week because oops prank party still still hasn't come out yet thank you Hudson for delaying that another week so I have to mention it for you free advertising there
2408951	2410652	More Bomberman, Hudson, do you hear me?
2410752	2412073	More Bomberman.
2412093	2415496	There's a new Bomberman game coming to the Xbox Live Arcade at some point.
2415636	2416276	Bomberman.
2416556	2418198	I've seen it with my own eyes.
2420839	2426844	From Coco Interactive, it's another casual game, Jewel Master Cradle of Athena.
2427264	2428425	Who gives a crap what it's about?
2428545	2431027	It's just a jewel game that you match three.
2433748	2435388	NBA Jam coming out on the Wii.
2435709	2442111	That's right, you get it before the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions because it was actually supposed to come out standalone on the Wii.
2443092	2447893	None of this fancy stuff because your game sucks so you have to delay it and that kind of fun stuff.
2452235	2454256	And that would be it for this week.
2454696	2456017	I know, disappointing.
2456577	2459118	Not a lot of pets games.
2460103	2461203	Yeah, it needs more monkeys.
2461643	2462544	Definitely more monkeys.
2464104	2467805	Sadly, there are no monkeys being released in Japan this week either.
2468646	2480449	But there is Enslaved Odyssey to the West on both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, as well as F1 2010 on both of those consoles.
2481049	2489192	And Red Dead Redemption and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 are both out on the 360 and the PSP as well this week.
2490337	2500299	And on the PS3, but not on the Xbox 360, we have Geki Joban Macross F, Itsuwarino Utahime Hybrid Pack.
2500739	2501659	Yay, that's a mouthful.
2501939	2502639	I heard Macross.
2503279	2503499	Yes.
2504940	2506740	Macross F, to be precise.
2507920	2509401	That's from the new anime, Frontier.
2509881	2510121	Right.
2510361	2510601	Yeah.
2511861	2517202	And Kento Mahou Togakugen Mono 3 is also coming out for the PlayStation 3.
2518842	2525964	Coming out on the Sony PSP this week, we've got Boku wa Koku Kanseikan, Airport Hero Haneda.
2527344	2529885	That should be something with an airport in it, I assume.
2531185	2535286	Kana Imoto is coming out, as well as the limited edition version.
2537807	2543668	Ken to Mahou to Gakugen 3, or Mono 3, is also coming out on the PSP.
2545004	2552070	And lastly, for Japanese releases on the Nintendo DS, we've got Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
2553871	2555052	Yeah, that's fun.
2555092	2556053	I love Kingdom Hearts.
2556153	2556674	Yay!
2558335	2572066	We also have Tenkaichi Sengoku Lovers and Maru Gogaku Shikaku Dashu Hanbashi Kente Shiken 2Q3Q That's too many QQs.
2574087	2574767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2595027	2599349	On the 5th, we have Left 4 Dead, The Sacrifice for PC and Xbox 360.
2600310	2602431	And on the 5th, we also have Phantasy Star Portable 2.
2603471	2605232	On the 8th is a whole crap ton of stuff.
2606012	2612696	Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Enslaved, Odyssey to the West, Final Fantasy, The Four Heroes of Light, Front Mission Evolved...
2613596	2616799	John Daly's Pro Stroke Golf, because he likes to stroke it.
2617040	2617660	Around the world.
2617880	2619482	Like a pro in England.
2620062	2620483	Oh dear.
2622185	2629832	PES 2011, WeParty, and WRC on a bunch of systems.
2630172	2631514	And that would be it for the UK.
2633875	2635637	Alright.
2635917	2646127	Well, one game that's not coming out this week, or even when it was intentionally going to come out back in April of 2011, Gears of War 3 has been delayed to the fourth quarter.
2647609	2648449	No reason why.
2648730	2654095	I'm sure it's just to add extra polish, or because Microsoft realized, hey, we don't have a good fourth quarter game, so...
2655476	2684035	it will not be coming out when it's intended but you know what there's plenty of games coming out in April and hell I wouldn't want to take any more time away from Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so I'm fine with that delay I definitely I think I could just totally ignore any Gears of War for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 because that game is full of the awesome intensive characters I want to play
2684733	2711154	yeah uh MVC3 yes Gears of War 3 uh probably not because I haven't played Gears of War 1 or 2 just saying yeah I don't know I think I I'm most excited for playing as uh X-23 and Deadpool oh I don't know about Deadpool but well yeah Deadpool in video games is kind of cool because he like he's aware that he's a video game character and he has all the
2711752	2712573	Deadpool is self-aware now
2740305	2742146	is Beyond Good and Evil.
2742226	2743307	Do you guys remember that game?
2743507	2743767	Yes.
2745108	2748330	That was a good game and it's actually getting an HD re-release.
2748690	2756475	So Ubisoft is going to be re-releasing the game in high definition and they haven't said when but sometime in 2011.
2758016	2759797	That sounds like it will be a treat.
2760618	2761398	Yes indeed.
2761478	2762999	I'm very excited about that.
2763119	2764620	I really loved that game.
2765060	2765841	It was a good game.
2767082	2768903	Well now it's time...
2770305	2773067	For the classic game of the week.
2774668	2780732	And because I do this, it's kind of weird for me to have to manipulate the music and everything at the same time.
2781472	2782953	So I'm actually just going to stop that.
2784774	2787496	Because I don't have Rob's mad skills to do them all at the same time.
2788357	2794200	And I will instead start off with a little bit of music, and I'd like to see how many people can guess what it is.
2794861	2795862	Just by the opening.
2796202	2796982	Presented by Sega.
2799912	2801533	That should be clue enough.
2804676	2810241	Yes, the game of the week is Samba de Amigo.
2810621	2813103	Woohoo!
2813363	2813823	Party!
2815064	2817426	I have a special love of Samba de Amigo.
2818007	2823011	This music is just so perky.
2823251	2827375	I feel like shaking my butt or some maracas or maybe the microphone like a maraca.
2828923	2829843	Or all three of those.
2830364	2834168	I will do them all at the same time, which makes it really bad for radio.
2835649	2843737	At any rate, as we've been talking about maracas, yes, you use maracas as your controllers, and they have these little sensors on the bottom.
2845439	2849422	And what you do is you have to hit these little...
2850663	2851564	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2880484	2882326	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2903684	2904225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2923202	2930686	And then the Sticky Man, Stickly Man comes up on the screen, which we all know Stickly Man from his next job working for Homestar Runner.
2932367	2940652	But he poses, and you have to match that pose by holding each maraca at the right position as indicated on the screen.
2941092	2941553	DarkSakura.com
2963253	2972097	Um, in the Japanese version, it's called Ichi ni Sanba, which is a funny pun in Japanese, because it's one, two, three, but san, ba, yeah, anyway.
2972677	2983161	Um, there's party mode and battle, where you can play versus couples game, there's a couples game version, which in Japan is called Love Love, where you play through the song to see how compatible you are.
2984442	2986243	And then, um, in, uh,
2987523	3007877	Later versions, in version 2000, there's different things to play in there, like hustle mode, where you have to follow the dots and shake the maracas the right way, but you have to do things in these really weird poses, and you're actually moving the full 360 rotation around, so it's kind of interesting.
3008817	3013921	There's also different versions out that have extra songs in there.
3014501	3015362	Version 2000, Amiga, Tambourine
3034833	3057347	Different Sega games, like for downloadables you had the theme from Afterburners, you had Burning Hearts from Burning Rangers, which I love You also have the Rent-A-Hero theme, which is incredibly funny, stuff from Nights, stuff from Sonic Adventure, Jet Set Radio, Daytona USA, Outrun, Fantasy Zone, the Opa Opa theme is in there
3058367	3065654	Sonic CD, the Japanese opening song is in there, Super Sonic Racing from Sonic R, and just a bunch of cool stuff.
3065714	3071058	But as far as the songs in the game, definitely some people might recognize Mambo No.
3071078	3072219	5 and Mexican Flyer.
3073040	3077784	Well, anyone who played Space Channel 5 and watched Swing Girls should know that song anyway.
3079445	3083029	Oyakumova by Santana, Papa Loves Mambo is in there.
3084109	3089975	Um, also SOS The Tiger Took My Family by Dr. Bombay is in there, which has nothing to do with Latin music.
3091016	3092277	And yet is still awesome.
3092537	3092797	Yes.
3094058	3101665	And, um, one of my favorite things to play in there was, um, actually, uh, The Cup of Life is in there.
3101685	3102426	I thought it was funny.
3103006	3106490	And the stupid catch-up song is in there, which I always avoided.
3106850	3108071	And Highway to Hell is in there.
3108892	3109913	In the Wii version, anyway.
3109933	3110013	Okay.
3110723	3113492	That has a lot to do with Latin music.
3113993	3117785	I'm going to play the combination of Highway to Hell and...
3119693	3122914	Tub Thumping, which is also in all of the versions.
3124555	3125015	It's really fun.
3125255	3130817	Actually, the Wii version did come out, but it didn't get very, very good ratings.
3132778	3134918	It has some extra stuff in there.
3134938	3139380	It has Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet and Mambo Mambo and I Want Candy.
3140660	3144822	And it's got other characters in there, such as Sonic and Ulala.
3145602	3146023	Ooh.
3146843	3152048	And you can, it will use your little me's and put some right by your score.
3152789	3158574	And it changes the different expressions that are used based on your performance in the game.
3159935	3163739	There was a successor out that not many people know about.
3163779	3164940	I've actually played it.
3166241	3176063	that's called Shakuto Tambourine which is played just like Samba de Amigo except you use a tambourine controller and it's all J-pop music.
3177103	3191046	And there was a version of Samba de Amigo kinda that was the eye toy version for Sega Superstars where it used the eye toy to hold where your hands were instead of the sensors like the maracas used.
3191546	3195727	And by the way, Shakuto Tambourine is actually really fun and very hard.
3196327	3196767	Just saying.
3197148	3197508	Very hard.
3198248	3205153	Because you've only got one tambourine, and you have to do these little swiping moves over your head and shake the tambourine at the same time, and it's kind of a pain in the butt.
3205994	3206974	Anyway, you've got characters.
3206994	3212718	You have Amigo, who we've mentioned is a monkey, and Amiga, who is also a monkey.
3213278	3213699	Woohoo!
3214399	3218802	And we have Linda, who is the samba school dancer that wears the butterfly costume.
3219823	3222425	And Bingo and Bongo, they're bears that play the bongos.
3223045	3225707	Rio is a cat person who's like a cat and a jaguar.
3226447	3255787	he carries a rose and a horn there's Chumba and Wamba who play the mandolin and the conga drums and they're named after Chumba Wamba and Mr. Pose who is also known as Stickly Man and that is the game that is Samba de Amigo which I personally think the Dreamcast ones are the best but that would be me so anybody else enjoy Samba de Amigo
3256778	3259319	Somebody Amigo is awesome.
3260539	3274505	The way that you describe the characters just now, it makes me think of old Disney cartoons like DuckTales and Tailspin, where it's a town full of weird animals doing stuff that people usually do.
3274605	3280227	It sounds like Somebody Amigo belongs in the Disney kind of world.
3282208	3284749	Yeah, I guess so.
3286465	3292750	I mean, maybe they've got their own, like, Amigaville, where they all hang out and drink Nescafe.
3293891	3296874	That was a good, I used to play Samba de Amigo a lot, like,
3297372	3298552	A million years ago.
3298853	3299793	It was a long time ago.
3299953	3300773	It was a good game, though.
3300893	3301193	It was fun.
3301233	3302014	Oh, it was fantastic.
3302054	3322261	Well, it's like my old New Year's parties that we used to have over here were always... I mean, rock bands pretty much replaced just about everything music-related, but would always break out DDR and Samba de Amigo and pretty soon would just be drunk in Samba de Amigo, surrounded by lots of beer, and people would fall over, and I would tell them not to break my maracas.
3323641	3351748	I still have my maracas and I still I should dust them off and play them soon you should well we are now though sadly at the end of part A but this means we get to go into part B yay so everyone stay tuned we are going to go to a little break and we will hear you when we we will talk to you when we get back you will hear us when we get back I can't hear them
3352928	3353308	Ah, no.
3353789	3354049	Okay.
3361158	3364042	Welcome back to part B of episode 4384.
3368975	3396777	384 episode yes of Orange Lounge Radio I am DarkSakura this is Loki and joining us is Mar and Marvel also known as or known in real life as Tiara I just told them your secret identity oh no it's like you unmasked me in front of millions and millions of people now I'm going to have to make a deal with the devil and have my entire history changed so that nobody knows who I am
3397259	3398741	Except really the Illuminati's behind it.
3399221	3399482	Yeah.
3400002	3400243	Yeah.
3402525	3403466	So welcome back.
3403587	3411616	But that's another reference to perhaps a different podcast that Tara and I do.
3412497	3413098	Perhaps.
3413278	3414540	With another friend of ours.
3415421	3415521	Yes.
3415541	3417043	Who is also an Orange Lounge listener.
3418218	3420660	So, welcome back to the show, as I said.
3421260	3428386	We have got some rapid fire news coming up and tweeter topics, because they're tweety and gooden.
3428886	3432549	And if you're all good, then Tara might do it in a porn voice.
3434230	3434710	Perhaps.
3435010	3435391	Perhaps.
3436191	3436672	Perhaps.
3437933	3438393	Mayhaps?
3439113	3439874	Mayhaps.
3440014	3441795	We may have a porn voice tonight.
3442136	3442836	Ha ha ha.
3443377	3443717	Alright.
3443817	3445138	So why don't you get us started, Loki?
3445158	3445238	Okay.
3446035	3452277	Finally, we've been begging and pleading for Capcom to listen, and they have Mega Man Legends 3 has been announced.
3452997	3458859	Coming to the 3DS, of course, right now, it's just Project, or Mega Man Legends 3 Project.
3460019	3462280	It's a work in progress, I guess.
3462720	3466581	And we'll be coming out at some point, I'm guessing probably next year.
3467442	3468022	So that'll be kind of cool.
3469002	3474027	Then of course, this week, like every other week, Rock Band download content.
3474067	3474847	Got lots of it.
3474907	3476369	This week we've got REM.
3477750	3480652	They have a pack there, including Driver 8.
3481233	3482934	It's the end of the world as we know it.
3484696	3486397	Living Well is the best revenge.
3486958	3489100	Radio Free Europe, Stand...
3489580	3493302	Superman, These Days, and What's the Frequency, Kenneth.
3494142	3498144	Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in fake points.
3498784	3502926	Or you can get the pack for $13.49 or $10.80 Microsoft points.
3504126	3507968	Sorry, it's not available for a pack on the WiiWare store.
3509089	3512711	Also, the T-Rex pack featuring three songs from them.
3513211	3516633	Children of the Revolution, Cosmic Dancer, and Jeepster.
3516833	3521136	Also, those available for $2 each or $5.49 for the whole pack.
3521296	3523618	So, that'll be coming this week.
3524558	3526980	And, unfortunately, no standalone songs.
3527040	3528581	I guess it's just those two packs.
3529001	3532804	Well, I mean, you can purchase a song standalone in there, but nothing additional.
3533829	3544516	And then finally, there's been some new information coming out about my game of the year next year, Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
3545276	3547738	Some gameplay video looked absolutely awesome.
3548659	3553742	Of course, they had some details regarding the gameplay in case anyone had concerns.
3554342	3555764	Thanks for watching!
3569376	3596233	and 150 weapons also I believe you can earn different points to increase abilities on your player as well as the weapons that you have there will also be an equivalent to the genocide gun in the game which for those who haven't played Earth Defense Force 2017 the genocide gun is a gun that fires a really big laser blast that blows up a lot of stuff the title itself will also run very smoothly as opposed to the last game that came out
3596753	3597513	The Legendary Infernal Mode
3617622	3644535	and they're also going to have a 6 player horde mode which apparently you will be pitted against endless waves of enemies that will attack you relentlessly also a remix mode where random enemies will spawn instead of the normal enemies that appear during the campaign and if you're very interested in checking it out there's some gameplay video on Destructoid and oh my god it looks awesome I was kind of worried though with the developer being the one that did the
3645555	3646815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3665420	3691111	and um apparently they are pretty good and they'll actually help you out through the game otherwise you can get people to help you out and uh definitely looking forward to this gonna probably pick up about three copies of it so make sure I have one for uh each person to play at my work so yeah check it out and we got any more news Tiara yes we do
3692320	3701927	Those of you who have pre-ordered your keyboard bundle for Rock Band 3 on the PS3 may have noticed that it has disappeared from US retail sites.
3702768	3710993	And that's because there is a contract problem where Harmonix cannot sell the PS3 keyboard bundle.
3711594	3714916	So you will have to buy your keyboard for $10 extra.
3715516	3718859	But you can still buy the bundle on the Xbox 360 and Wii.
3719059	3719699	So that's good.
3719759	3720320	Yay, because...
3721050	3750748	I have the Xbox 360 and also Konami is releasing an awesome awesome awesome new 3D racing arcade game called Road Fighters and it's got like a cabinet with a steering wheel and it has drop down 3D glasses so that's kind of awesome and you can switch between 2D and 3D by pushing a button and I don't know it seems cool I love arcade games like this I suck at racing games but
3751209	3761538	It just looks cool, and 3D is the whole new fad of TV movies and gaming, so it should be interesting, and it does look really cool.
3761638	3776770	The glasses look ridiculous, I have to say, but it should be fun, and 3D really, I think, is an excellent element for a racing game, since you are right in there with all the cars and all the excitement.
3777091	3778592	The glasses look 80s-tastic.
3779099	3779620	They do.
3779720	3780600	They really do.
3780700	3782942	I think that's part of the reason it's so awesome.
3783343	3784123	That's great.
3785925	3795753	And lastly, with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 coming out and Street Fighter 4 released lately and things like that, what about Darkstalkers?
3796254	3801058	I would like to see another game having something to do with Darkstalkers, wouldn't you?
3801078	3801498	Absolutely.
3801558	3802019	Absolutely.
3802751	3814862	Well, Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono told Eurogamer that making another game in the series would be his ultimate dream, and it can only happen if fans demand it.
3815382	3823309	And he said that it's all up to the readers to get Inafune-san interested in doing the game.
3823650	3828133	And according to Ono, it would take one million requests before Inafune says yes.
3829014	3829435	So...
3830983	3845676	unfortunately there haven't been that many requests for the game there have been about 5,000 so only 995,000 more requests for a Darkstalkers game before they will consider making one get on it peeps I'm not going to put my name in there
3846553	3847373	Darkstalkers is awesome.
3871772	3878218	Yeah, but I think that they should know that the interest is out there, and if they made the game, that people would buy it.
3878538	3882221	And, you know, for them to be like, oh no, you have to ask us for it.
3882421	3883762	Well, just make the freaking game.
3883802	3885704	It's not like you're going to be losing money on it.
3885924	3887365	We'll ask for it with our dollars.
3888006	3888206	Yes.
3888226	3888847	Or our yen.
3889227	3896733	I mean, to put it bluntly, it's like saying, okay, listen, you gotta suck my cock, but you're going to have to beg for it first.
3896893	3897394	I mean, that's...
3898999	3899839	It's the way they're putting it.
3899899	3902240	I mean, it's insulting.
3902460	3908842	I mean, if you want to put out a game, put out a good fighting game because people are going to buy any fighting game that you put out.
3909363	3910823	Don't make people beg for it.
3910963	3915625	We own the recipe for these fantastic lollipops, but a million of you must say that you want our lollipops.
3917385	3918946	And by lollipops, we mean cock.
3920947	3924308	I was trying to do something that every... Who does not like a good lollipop?
3924468	3924868	I mean, please.
3926707	3928069	Parasite Eve was pretty cool.
3945547	3947209	Not bad for a game based off of a book.
3948851	3953055	So they're basically just going to be bringing it out.
3953095	3955518	They just have to tweak it so that it will be playable.
3955638	3956820	And it's not just Parasite Eve.
3956900	3957700	It's Parasite Eve 2.
3957921	3959943	Did you ever see the live action movie?
3960864	3961765	I have it somewhere.
3961805	3962486	I haven't watched it.
3962506	3965449	I've been trying to look for the translated version of the book.
3966548	3968369	I think I have it on VCD somewhere.
3968489	3969790	I've got a VCD of it.
3969810	3971872	Yeah, my copy's on a VCD as well.
3972673	3974975	I just sort of, oh, that's cool.
3975295	3976176	Oh, look what else we've got.
3976196	3979379	Final Fuck X. Because I think I got them both at the same time.
3979519	3980720	That was also based off a book.
3981981	3982301	Not really.
3984643	3999899	and moving forward how about Scott Pilgrim the new download content is going to have for Scott Pilgrim I said Spock Pilgrim Spock Pilgrim I would buy Spock Pilgrim because it is Spocktober you know
4000279	4000879	Yes, it is.
4001499	4009801	For Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, The Game, there is going to be new download content to go along with the film's release on DVD and Blu-ray.
4010441	4014782	It will have a new playable character, Knives Chow, along with two other modes.
4015442	4020583	That's an arena battle with weapons, kind of a light version of Super Smash Bros.
4020623	4022563	it's described as, and dodgeball.
4022943	4025903	And it will be $1.99 on PlayStation Network or 160 Microsoft points on Xbox Live.
4029684	4053661	and they also are going to fix some of the difficulty balancing to make it the average Joe level more forgiving and get rid of some bugs and do drop in drop out co-op it's only though for offline play only and they're not going to incorporate the online MMO into it so none of that yet
4055060	4061805	And then, speaking of Spock, Star Trek Infinite Space is to be coming out.
4061945	4065487	It's a free-to-play browser version of the game.
4067328	4069050	So Mac people can play it.
4069510	4070911	Yay!
4071111	4072232	And it will be out in summer of 2011.
4073332	4081298	It's going to be published by Gameforge and developed by Keen, who also did What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver.
4082815	4083015	Ooh.
4083816	4085517	And now this is the part that makes me happy.
4085677	4087418	It's set during Deep Space Nine.
4087898	4088879	That's cool.
4089239	4092221	I thought you were going to say Jamie Oliver's in the game, so... No.
4092381	4092962	That's exciting.
4093182	4094843	That's not special.
4095683	4099966	The only cooking I want is the Klingon chef who plays the violin.
4100766	4101007	Yes.
4101867	4102788	And sings opera.
4103448	4104609	Klingon opera is the best.
4105369	4105910	Yes, it is.
4106450	4108571	And serves half-dead gach.
4109812	4110873	And of course you will...
4111874	4111974	Yay!
4112014	4112174	And, uh...
4138578	4144063	Well, it's not STO, but I like that it's set in the Deep Space Nine universe.
4144103	4148527	That makes me particularly happy, because Deep Space Nine was my favorite.
4149067	4159317	Well, it's, you know, I mean, TNG was going on at the same time as Deep Space Nine, so it's probably going to be more focused towards the war, I'm guessing, with the Jem'Hadar.
4159997	4162580	So that'll be pretty awesome, because that was really a great arc.
4165394	4172619	I agree, and it certainly opened up lots of fantastic characterization for all kinds of people in the series, so I thought it was fantastic.
4173500	4181985	So, moving forward, we've had another visitor come into the room who was not supposed to be in the room.
4183086	4184127	You need to go find your mommy.
4185067	4185728	Please shut the door.
4187809	4188530	Thank you, Pumpkin.
4189791	4190051	Sorry.
4190511	4191392	She didn't shut the door.
4191412	4191852	Off with her head!
4194847	4195929	Oh, that was Sophie.
4197251	4200937	That is my cousin-in-law's daughter.
4202841	4204844	Yes, we have lots of children over right now.
4205245	4207028	She was excited about Star Trek.
4207068	4207889	Can you blame her?
4208530	4208771	Yeah.
4209951	4214995	She came in wearing my Indiana Jones hat when we were talking about Star Trek.
4215075	4216536	So, where were we?
4216816	4221679	Oh yes, we were over to Twitter Topics, weren't we?
4222220	4223681	What do we use for Twitter Topics again?
4223741	4224481	Journey to Wonderland?
4226723	4227583	Well, we're using it.
4228784	4229885	It's Twitter Topic time.
4235450	4238191	I don't have any Twitter topics so we forgot to tell them to send Twitter topics.
4238251	4239132	I did not forget.
4239152	4240972	I told them during the break.
4241753	4244654	Yeah, we told them in the chat room to send the Twitter topics.
4244814	4246375	So we do have some Twitter topics.
4247535	4248555	And let's see.
4249236	4258059	TigerClaw305 sent us a story about ex-Nintendo sales chief to lead Kidzania's creation of kid-sized cities.
4259120	4260520	So let's see what this is about.
4260860	4261661	I found the right music. ...
4266378	4267959	Ah, that sounds more like it.
4267979	4268859	Now you can continue.
4270740	4277603	Kidzania is creating places for kids to learn about real life jobs and entertain themselves in mini cities with shopping malls.
4278624	4283746	So, I don't know, it sounds kind of like some kind of second life type thing.
4283986	4284346	I don't know.
4285407	4286967	Second life equals no life.
4287868	4288088	Yeah.
4290081	4311846	and TigerClaw305 also sent that the Just Cause film has been optioned and the movie script will be written by Michael Ross and it will be produced by Adrian Ask Korea and that should be kind of cool or probably crappy because video game movies kind of suck.
4312046	4315127	And when asked why they decided to make the movie, they said Just Cause.
4316875	4318176	Well, sure, why not?
4318516	4319517	We're gonna make it.
4319877	4321438	That's the reason, yes.
4322158	4324520	And for the record, Shadowrunner says Fallout Children.
4327902	4333646	Let's see, Jay Jugo says, Hey guys, I like this new way to present a co-host on the show.
4333886	4338088	This is a must-keep, in caps, NEVER FORGET, in hashtag.
4338309	4339149	Never forget.
4339810	4340310	Never.
4341671	4345093	Okay, and Spazinator says, in my porn voice,
4346254	4351196	Hey, there's a crap ton of new free vids on the PSN store right now.
4351836	4354758	I assume that they're also available on XBL, too.
4355058	4356218	So what do you think about that?
4357339	4359400	That sounds hot.
4359420	4359480	Ooh.
4361240	4363821	Tiger Claw Sentence is another story, but we already talked about it.
4363941	4365822	Blizzard banning StarCraft II cheaters.
4367603	4367823	And...
4368645	4370366	Dark Kisuke says, wait, what?
4370486	4372467	Sexual innuendos in Orange Lounge?
4372587	4373088	No way.
4373448	4374048	Yes way.
4374168	4375029	Of course way.
4375189	4375549	Duh.
4375909	4376490	Lollipops.
4376530	4377090	Way way.
4379391	4383073	And Matt Ostro... Okay, yeah, I can't say that.
4383113	4388256	Matt Ostrovsky, sorry if I said that wrong, Matt, sent us a story.
4388777	4390378	He says, his story sounds too good.
4390438	4391398	It might be a Skrull.
4391618	4391998	Oh no!
4393039	4395741	Yuji Naka wants to work on the Dreamcast 2.
4398072	4398472	No.
4398492	4400193	Oh yeah.
4400613	4401994	We can dream, we can dream.
4402014	4402934	That is wrong.
4402954	4404655	That's never going to happen.
4405255	4409597	We can dream about the Dreamcast.
4411158	4411898	Poor Dreamcast.
4411958	4412779	Not going to happen.
4413179	4415660	I think one more person sent a Twitter topic.
4415720	4425625	Yes, AlphaKananagram sent us a topic about the Katamari Damacy director and his wife starting a new company called Uvula.
4425645	4426085	Uvula.
4427148	4428429	with a Loki website.
4429190	4439060	And then rather than focusing solely on game development, the company's About Us page details a focus on music and video games, adding that we want to widen our limit.
4440161	4440602	Okay.
4440662	4441482	Widen the limit.
4442483	4444886	So what could they do to top Noby Noby Boy?
4444906	4446307	Hmm.
4447088	4449851	But you know, I actually still play Noby Noby Boy on my iPhone.
4452463	4454363	I'm not surprised by this actually.
4454383	4456244	He's going to eventually meet girl.
4458624	4464325	It's just like I have no brain capacity to think of anything to do so I'm going to play with my little warm person.
4465985	4466425	It works.
4466925	4469446	DDRDollarBill says no Dreamcast 2 ever.
4469686	4470226	Alas.
4472326	4475507	Sadness.
4475987	4479528	MesaSuma Shenmue 3 on Dreamcast 2 fall of 20 never ever.
4483154	4483334	Aw.
4485516	4488377	But yeah, that will do it for our Twitter topics this week.
4488597	4498843	And if you want to have your Twitter topics read by Rob when he is back next week, then send your Twitter topics to Rob at OLR on Twitter and he will read them, I'm sure.
4499203	4503466	Maybe we can get Rob, instead of doing a porn voice, he can invite Mr. Spanky.
4505787	4511210	Rob can do one of his voices, which always sound like Rob with kind of a high-pitched voice.
4513738	4517031	So how about we find a few more topics to discuss?
4519952	4520832	I suppose we could.
4521393	4523033	And it's kind of interesting.
4523713	4532056	Apparently, of course, it's not unexpected, Sony is going after anything that's possibly going to mod the PlayStation 3.
4532176	4546480	Of course, they went after the PS Jailbreak before, and now that that's kind of gone, because there's free versions out there, they're now going after other things, including the PS Groove, the kind of open source...
4550444	4557691	PS Freedom, and OpenPS Jailbreak They are aiming for takedowns.
4559432	4567139	Apparently the website PSX Scene has found some different things that they've marked out.
4567319	4585494	Exhibits and they are trying to basically erase the existence of these, not necessarily the devices, but of these programs because the devices themselves can be practically anything nowadays because they've been adopting the PS Groove to
4587543	4588263	Practically everything.
4588723	4602086	Everything from an iPod to a TI-84 to some old ass MP3 players, USB development, cards, just everything.
4602546	4605727	Unfortunately not PSP because they were unable to port it over to the PSP.
4605767	4611708	But your phone, iPhone, Droid, you name it, it can hack the PS3 now.
4615984	4617125	Your mom can hack a PS3.
4617165	4621287	They're going to start hack-storing brains because people are always going to think of a way to do it.
4622068	4626570	Yeah, I mean, you can try to stop people from doing that stuff, but where there's a will, there's a way.
4626950	4628311	And if they want to hack it, they will.
4629532	4630012	Exactly.
4633534	4642960	Speaking of hack-storing brains, during the Tokyo Game Show event, Q Entertainment head Tetsuya Mizu
4643427	4649951	and Mizuguchi unveiled the new component of his upcoming rail shooter, Child of Eden.
4650912	4654794	And he wants participation from us.
4656135	4659577	And it's for part of the game he calls The Journey Project.
4660018	4668083	And he's seeking to build a collection of player-submitted pictures for inclusion on the last level of the Child of Eden game.
4669442	4674084	Mizuguchi says, In this game, the player's mission is to purify everything, even data.
4674664	4676405	And this is the final stage of the game, you know.
4676525	4679446	I need the beauty of memories.
4680187	4686930	So with collected memories of family, friends, and beautiful landscapes, you can get that kind of memory with music.
4687010	4687790	It must be real.
4688730	4692552	Mizuguchi also added, I want to put everybody's credit at the end of the game.
4693392	4693753	Uh, yeah.
4694433	4694613	Um...
4695495	4704221	Ubisoft clarified that images can be submitted to the official Child of Eden website through November 20th and any approved photos will be used in the game.
4705021	4710525	I can't even imagine what's going to be submitted by random people.
4712326	4713187	No butts in the game.
4716309	4717610	We're going to get a lot of ganguro.
4719611	4720452	Which would be kind of funny.
4722493	4724054	What the hell is going on out there?
4726321	4730144	Like I said, the cousins are over and they're having a fun time in the front room.
4730204	4731125	Happy fun time.
4731185	4736829	Watching YouTube videos of the guys singing all of the John Williams themes with his own lyrics.
4738570	4739731	Actually all about Star Wars.
4741773	4742153	Okay.
4742413	4743614	Yeah, some YouTube thing.
4745092	4767363	So, well, we do have a little bit of other news, at least I do, about Medal of Honor, which for anyone who tuned into Bobby's show earlier, they know this, or if they can read, but they have decided to change the name of the multiplayer faction Taliban to Opposing Force.
4768403	4777306	Yeah, they're doing it, as I said, out of respect for those in the military and for those who have lost family members in the war.
4778307	4781048	And they're trying not to show any disrespect.
4781268	4784869	I sort of have the opinion that they already had this in mind.
4785690	4789071	And this was a ploy to get a little more publicity.
4789091	4789151	But...
4793553	4800375	Hey, if they're doing this... I mean, the name Opposing Force is kind of unimaginative.
4801655	4802935	Generic, much?
4803836	4804836	Yeah, very generic.
4805836	4811057	Because, I mean, wouldn't Opposing Force all be relative to what force you are opposing?
4813198	4814558	They could just call it Bad Guys.
4814658	4816719	They should just... Bad Guys...
4818536	4819836	Oh no, the bad guys.
4819936	4821957	Then it's offensive to people who are bad.
4822577	4823297	Oh no!
4823317	4824658	Ah!
4825438	4827418	They should just call it Red Team?
4828039	4828559	Dudes.
4829099	4829519	Dudes?
4830059	4830559	Chicks.
4831920	4833940	But see, then that's just sexist right there.
4834520	4834900	Not really.
4834960	4837501	I call everyone dudes, so that's not sexist.
4837641	4843003	Yeah, but if you have chicks to find out in there as well, you just can't do that.
4843063	4844743	It should be dudes and blokes.
4845803	4846224	Blokes.
4846644	4847004	Blokes.
4847304	4847704	It works.
4848723	4849544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4870441	4871924	Oh no, I thought we were us.
4872465	4872886	I'm me.
4873366	4874789	It's me versus everybody.
4876532	4877434	Die!
4878356	4879217	No, anyway.
4880480	4881582	Misty says woot blokes.
4882423	4882644	Yeah.
4883835	4885337	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4902713	4923199	and also location tests I guess for XG2 are going to be starting soon as well as Guitar Freak's Drum Mania V7 that's way too many damn games that'll be starting very soon and
4925945	4929747	They haven't really said exactly when those location tests are actually going to start.
4929927	4931688	Same with GB Ripples.
4932388	4937971	That location test, sometime next year, but the only one announced so far is XG2.
4940152	4942033	Why is it called Knit?
4943674	4944154	I don't know.
4944774	4946895	Why does Konami name anything like that?
4948576	4949656	I want a knitting game.
4950977	4951837	But not really.
4953218	4954879	I believe there's Crafting Mama, so...
4956107	4983961	I want Crochet Master Master of Crochet You could call it Check My Hook To a guy who says Fancy Nancy Fancy Nancy Knit for Fancy Nancy Oh dear In other news Yes please Well we all know how
4985134	4987094	Weird and perverted the internets can be.
4988035	4998317	And so since the internets is full of weirdos and perverts, you have to take some measures to make sure that LEGO Universe can still be child-friendly.
4999157	5011200	And so NetDevil has recently outlined a couple of measures that they are implementing to help protect the MMO's younger players, since it is targeted towards kids.
5012197	5041393	and basically it includes content moderation which is no surprise to anyone really so you will have to get anything that you make the name will have to be approved before it will go out into the LEGO Universe world and the other part is a LEGO Universe ID which is kind of it actually sounds a lot like Nintendo's friend code system to where you give your LEGO Universe ID to other people outside of the game
5041923	5047408	And then they can see your creations that you've made even before they're approved.
5049650	5053474	Protecting the innocent childrens from the weirdos of the internet.
5053574	5054274	Yay!
5054635	5056977	And later on they will become the weirdos of the internet.
5057517	5060780	Indeed, but on their own, not without the perversion of other people.
5061201	5062402	Oh no, no, we can't have that.
5062722	5063543	Think of the children.
5064110	5065890	Think of the children and how crunchy they are.
5069611	5075453	Well, it's time for another special segment of the show that this time I will actually use the correct music for.
5077573	5079054	It's time for the mailbag.
5080154	5081574	And I've got the rubber gloves on.
5082935	5087016	It's bending its stinky self over and I'm opening the bag and...
5089383	5096904	This is kind of... Because Rob hasn't cleaned out the spam filter like he does for me, so there's all kinds of... Read the spam!
5097244	5099305	I don't know, read the spam, because I don't really care.
5099625	5101025	There's spam in there about Lady Gaga.
5101045	5103205	I should have left it in there for Rob, but I won't.
5103345	5104706	That's so Rob.
5106706	5107746	Rob loves Lady Gaga.
5107966	5110727	I have started appreciating Lady Gaga a little bit.
5111167	5112667	Lady Gaga is stalking me.
5113227	5113527	Really?
5114027	5117428	Ever since I sang Lady Gaga for karaoke...
5118138	5121761	One time, now she's following me everywhere and she's like in my head.
5124262	5130286	Now when you start, you know, busting out the asymmetrical wigs and, you know, dresses of meat.
5131447	5135050	I don't look enough like Marilyn Manson to pull off any of Lady Gaga's looks.
5135470	5139032	She was so much prettier before she went, anyway, I'm not going to get into that.
5139593	5140593	Greetings, OLR.
5140713	5144416	I come to Loki with a non-gaming question that I think he'll have a good answer for.
5145825	5146005	Ooh.
5147246	5147566	All right.
5147906	5151087	Loki, I'm a contractor and my cell phone contract is up.
5151567	5152748	What would you recommend for me?
5153488	5159410	All I want is a family plan with no text, no data, and 1,500 plus minutes of phone a month.
5159990	5160970	I've looked at the big four.
5161010	5164212	I didn't know if there's some weird hacker service that I'm unaware of.
5164652	5166952	At the moment, I'm leaning with T-Mobile because of price.
5167033	5168673	Loki, can you help a desperate turtle?
5168993	5171014	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.
5172055	5179647	And disclaimer, Orange Jones Radio is not paid by any of the companies that might be mentioned and we should be even if they wanted to pay us.
5180918	5181259	I don't know.
5181599	5188764	Honestly, I have a crap plan that didn't have any of that stuff, and it's actually more expensive than plans to have all that stuff, so go fig there.
5189705	5190986	Just have to really kind of shop it.
5191006	5202175	There's websites and stuff that you can actually put what you need for your plan, and it will kind of shop everybody and tell you what the most affordable plan for you is.
5203075	5206497	I can't think of the life of me what that website's called, but I know it's out there.
5207137	5209238	Well, it's not Google, it's something else.
5209838	5211638	But you can do that.
5212059	5219021	I'm planning on getting a phone through Virgin Mobile just because they're $25 a month for 300 minutes.
5219041	5222803	Because I honestly use like 12 minutes a month, if I'm lucky, on my phone.
5224023	5225964	So anything cheaper than that would be awesome.
5225984	5227685	I was actually looking at a prepaid phone.
5229346	5232908	But I think $25 a month with no contract would not be that bad.
5233889	5236451	And plus I can browse the internet on that if I really want to.
5237011	5238552	I'm sorry I texted you earlier.
5238812	5239732	I should give you a dollar.
5240213	5240573	I don't care.
5240753	5242034	It's alright.
5242574	5244415	Well, we've got some suggestions from the chat room.
5246216	5248738	Spazinator says to quote Monty Python, I hate spam.
5248838	5249738	And that's wrong.
5249898	5251920	It's, I don't like spam!
5253425	5270519	SSJ100 Matt says T-Mobile sucks and suggests Verizon and Ranma suggests go with Sprint, great coverage, dirt cheap Virgin also because they're piggybacking on the Sprint network Spazinator uses Cricket I use AT&T because I have an iPhone
5272074	5300676	and I basically use everything except the phone to call people I do not call people only if it's necessary because I hate talking on the phone I did it way too long for my job the only people I like talking to on the phone is like my mom because she's funny and frustrating at the same time I'm pretty happy with Verizon myself they're a little bit more expensive though but I get better coverage from them I have no reception for AT&T or Sprint within my house
5301465	5303986	And I deal with Verizon, so, you know, can't go wrong with that.
5304767	5307888	I noticed that I didn't get as good reception in your house when I visited.
5308389	5312771	Yep, it's AT&T and Sprint both have really crappy reception inside of my house.
5313191	5315572	AT&T's pretty good out, at least in Sacramento.
5316433	5320275	So the next email comes up from Kamitsuyo.
5320295	5322716	It says, Hi everyone at OLR.
5322856	5327098	I think it's time to revisit how Rob is doing on his quest to finish three games this summer.
5327498	5328819	I haven't heard any talk of it lately.
5328839	5330280	Considering the summer's over, yeah.
5330820	5331120	He failed.
5349042	5349823	Thank you for watching!
5364918	5372881	Anyway, what I'm writing about is an episode at the beginning of the summer when Rob talked about how he never finishes games and was dedicating himself to finish three games this summer.
5373322	5375643	Haven't heard any progress on this or on the show lately.
5376283	5380245	He has kind of inspired me to play several games to completion, which I have done several.
5380345	5385567	Red Dead Redemption, Final Fantasy XIII, Darksiders, Alan Wake, and currently working on God of War series on PS3.
5386212	5389733	Just finished the first, along with a slew of 360 arcade games.
5390493	5391073	Love the show.
5391153	5391813	Keep them coming.
5391833	5393893	Look forward to the big 10-year anniversary marathon.
5393973	5394533	Stay black.
5395114	5395714	Kamitsuyo.
5396594	5403015	And, yeah, one of the games that Rob was supposed to finish was Final Fantasy XIII, which is currently sitting in my living room because I'm playing it.
5404875	5409016	Of course, I'm also playing the... I'm sitting down with that Avatar game finally, too.
5410596	5413277	So we'll just have to make RobFest up next week, won't we?
5414557	5414757	Yes.
5414777	5414837	Yes.
5416022	5416822	And last email.
5417483	5418563	This is from DarkKisuke.
5419563	5424325	Just had to note, whatever that Japanese game you brought up on Twitter, I swear it was a fucking hentai.
5424605	5427006	Go back and listen for yourself and be the judge, XD.
5427126	5428787	Hail the FSM, DarkKisuke.
5430668	5431568	And that's it for email.
5432808	5433109	Hmm.
5434649	5439091	Well, if you have any emails you want to send us, it's mailbag at OrangeLodgeRadio.com.
5441015	5441415	Send it!
5442376	5445678	A couple more final stories here.
5445798	5448319	Actually, I think you have something that we need to do first.
5450260	5453061	Hold on, someone just said that the stream went down.
5454162	5455803	Although I don't think that it did, did it?
5457744	5459084	Can you hear us, internets?
5463266	5464347	It says the server's down.
5464467	5464867	Crap.
5465087	5465448	Hold on.
5466228	5467048	That's back online.
5467809	5468049	Is it?
5468329	5468609	Yeah.
5468769	5470230	Shoutcast is saying that it's not.
5471525	5471825	Oh, well.
5472066	5472446	Hold on.
5474568	5475608	Who crosses streams?
5475649	5476229	That's funny.
5477910	5481994	Well, we'll just let him... Winamp froze, actually.
5482454	5483055	Winamp froze.
5483795	5484736	Ah, that sucks.
5485277	5485897	Hold on.
5485917	5486878	Tara, can you let the chatroom know?
5487178	5487418	Yeah.
5487578	5487839	Thanks.
5488739	5490921	You probably want to make sure that Part B saves.
5491622	5498808	Maybe save it now and we'll continue on with Part 3, if you will.
5502597	5503517	I need to mark this down.
5503537	5503517	36, 45.
5504477	5507298	Shit, where's my pen?
5521301	5522481	Alright.
5523762	5524142	What's up?
5524422	5525622	Are they hearing us now or something?
5526462	5528103	No, I just like Loki's comment.
5528383	5529123	End scene.
5531523	5535045	I'm actually closing down Winamp.
5535425	5535785	Hold on.
5535805	5537026	I'm going to reload it.
5544129	5544689	Sorry.
5560856	5564478	All Games Radio is now broadcasting live from Sacramento, California.
5565119	5565919	Yes, we are.
5568001	5569041	Yay.
5569082	5569582	Hold on.
5569662	5571043	I've got to fix this to the right settings.
5571743	5572003	Okay.
5572324	5573585	MP3 encoder.
5575766	5576546	What the hell was it?
5576887	5577087	Hold on.
5577107	5577367	44 kilobyte.
5581430	5581450	96k.
5591756	5615056	and we should be back are we back can you hear us internets internets are you there oh crap I forgot we can't hear them all right let us know in the chat room if you can hear us we had a little bit of an issue which should be resolved now and thankfully it only went down during mailbag so and I gotta admit it is your fault chat room it really is it really is we we know
5616738	5621079	And DDRDollarBill says, I thought the Daleks were next week.
5621740	5622620	No, no, no, no.
5623860	5628302	So yeah, from what I understand, it went down during mailbag, so we'll make Rob edit it.
5628362	5629322	Yay!
5629482	5630242	Yay!
5631222	5634423	Okay, so shall we move forward with our little podcast?
5635344	5635564	Yes.
5636804	5638545	Loki, rescue us.
5640005	5642366	Actually, you can't rescue us right now.
5642466	5642846	You know why?
5645007	5645827	It's at the use of the week.
5647130	5649154	Just in time for the stream to go down.
5652059	5652980	Timing is impeccable.
5653241	5653662	Yes it is.
5669545	5680359	My FU of the week goes to the stream for going down while I was busy paying attention to other things and for Rob going to Club 33 without me!
5681520	5681900	Bitch.
5682802	5683743	Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
5684404	5684644	Loki.
5685914	5693499	If you did my headache that I've had for two days now, and it just won't go away.
5694219	5699122	Lack of sleep, really, but I've been trying to get sleep and just can't.
5700343	5701403	You have a small person.
5701504	5703385	Well, it's not even, yeah.
5703925	5704525	It's a little bit him.
5704886	5705426	Actually, it's all him.
5707346	5710747	So, yeah, it's been very tiring to say the least.
5711267	5722029	And, yeah, so that's, after that, after the crappy drivers, I literally saw somebody pass somebody on the right within the same lane on my way here.
5722409	5723770	And I was just like, really?
5724710	5724970	Really?
5725250	5726030	You just did that?
5726390	5731091	You're in that much of a hurry that you need to pass somebody in the same lane on the wrong side?
5732228	5733369	Awesome, thank you.
5733890	5734951	And Effie the Scammers.
5735191	5746341	Which, by the way, brings us to our favorite, well, my new favorite topic, which is shoutouts to people on AOL Instant Messenger.
5746421	5752367	In fact, we have somebody that you probably should give a shoutout to and let them know that they should really do the right thing.
5752907	5754529	And that person would be...
5755029	5758971	Pimpin Tyler 146 on AOL Instant Messenger.
5759691	5763292	I will be posting his name in the chat room and Twitter.
5763652	5772596	Be sure to give him a nice little hi because he is a douchebag that didn't come through on his end of the transactions.
5773356	5774777	I'm sure he'd love to hear from all of you.
5779008	5779608	Yes, I do.
5779928	5780768	F you to my work.
5780908	5785269	Because not only am I working my normal shift, which is 9 to 6.
5785369	5785789	Not bad.
5786249	5791310	But I'm also now working these extra days where I'm working until midnight or 1am.
5791810	5794171	And it's really messing up my sleep schedule.
5794611	5797391	And they don't want to pay me overtime.
5798411	5801672	And on next Sunday, I get to work from 2pm to 2am.
5802172	5804212	And that really, really sucks.
5804352	5805813	And I did not sign on for this.
5805973	5807093	And so F you my work.
5807935	5811517	Don't they have to pay you overtime if you work more than a certain amount of hours?
5812077	5813138	No, because I'm salary.
5813798	5814599	Oh, that sucks.
5816480	5818260	But they don't want to give me any incentives either.
5818300	5822743	They just want to do this stuff, and it's like, this is not part of my job description, you know?
5822863	5824124	So it's very upsetting.
5825244	5826825	Well, that sucks.
5826845	5828426	I hope there's some improvement soon.
5832861	5843737	Well, now that the FUs are over and we're full of angst that we have now released onto the unsuspecting internet, Loki, do you have another story for us?
5846040	5846761	Of course I do.
5847629	5876464	and it's funny since you mentioned release there is going to be a brand new peripheral coming to the Nintendo Wii Remote unfortunately it is not something that is say approved by Nintendo or even something that you would say use with a Nintendo game we've covered this yes but they finally actually were going to be releasing them now fun
5877534	5883211	But these are Nintendo Wii remote accessories that are kind of...
5885697	5887198	They're for dildonics, basically.
5887418	5891739	It's two different peripherals to use.
5892119	5897521	And what the main function of this, obviously, is it's actually for chatting over the web.
5898121	5909164	They're using the Wii remotes as kind of a Bluetooth adapter so that these things can vibrate and you can remotely vibrate them across the web using, I guess, different programs.
5910165	5913686	It's the Mojo Weejo is what it's actually called, the company.
5914726	5936830	and I believe that they said they're going to be supporting a bunch of different chat applications and I'm sure their own chat application as well but it's in the beta stage right now but it'll be available for purchase in time for holiday season 2010 so God I would not want to be part of that beta test
5937470	5945056	I had to link a copy of that image in the chat room, but I think it's funny that there's like a whole YouTube video describing how it's supposed to be used.
5946117	5947398	It's intensely hilarious.
5949079	5949520	Indeed.
5950500	5950821	Yeah.
5951001	5954383	Intensely hilarious.
5954444	5958287	I don't know, even the name is just too ridiculous for me.
5958787	5959568	Mojo Weejo.
5960608	5961709	Mojo Weejo.
5961789	5965372	See, even porn voice doesn't make Mojo Weejo sound good.
5965732	5966373	No, it doesn't.
5967048	5968769	And your porn voice is excellent.
5969409	5969810	Thank you.
5970130	5970550	You're welcome.
5971991	5974892	Moving on, away from the porns.
5976513	5984998	Former Sega man Yuji Naka is working on an action game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 with Prope.
5986139	5990941	And he hasn't revealed what the game is yet, but he will soon.
5991582	5993583	So, according to Naka...
5994844	6003251	They are doing a few quite big action game projects at Prope, but he didn't tell us anything about them.
6004032	6009896	He did say that a very original action game based in the sky will be revealed within this month.
6010917	6012959	So that's something to look forward to.
6012979	6014680	I hope it has airships.
6015121	6016101	Yay, airships!
6016782	6019064	I wonder if it's going to be Skies of Arcadia.
6020053	6021093	Ooh, maybe.
6021874	6022294	Could be.
6023274	6025795	It's based in the sky, and it involves airships.
6026335	6026715	Indeed.
6027975	6033237	Well, we will know soon, according to Nakasan, right?
6033857	6034497	Yes, soon.
6034557	6037718	Within this month, they are going to tell us about his project.
6039517	6040218	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6055616	6081902	if we can get it to work so I'm going to go ahead and make this disclaimer right now because we do have Tiara in through Skype I'm going to try to get these to work as a conference call so we don't have to disconnect on her so I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now and go ahead and make your calls I'm not going to play any music call
6085918	6086379	Ah, yes.
6087239	6088741	This is about we do the waiting game.
6088821	6089221	Hi, Dan.
6091623	6092083	Riveting.
6093645	6094245	It is riveting.
6094265	6096467	Oh, we got a call.
6096627	6097428	Hey, we got a call.
6097828	6098528	I'm going to answer.
6102151	6104493	Hello, you're talking to Orange Lounge Radio.
6104553	6105014	Who is this?
6106175	6107776	This is DJ Blaziken.
6108256	6109597	Hi, DJ Blaziken.
6109657	6110318	How are you?
6111719	6113921	I'm doing fine, and I just found...
6114765	6143401	a solution for all DSI owners that might be listening in I found this out through the internet and through the grace of it because I don't know if any of you guys have had this problem but I have and I'm sure there might be a few of you that might have had this the L and R buttons becoming not able to be fixed when hit and you'd have to end up Kung Fu mashing them in
6144147	6151692	Well, the thing is, the little gap that lets it go down is basically letting dust in.
6152313	6157896	Basically, best bet, take a little mini vac or whatever you have to suck the dirt out and do exactly that.
6158517	6162079	It's supposed to... Actually, it's made my DS work again.
6162860	6163860	Fully functional again.
6165581	6167563	Well, thank you for sharing the tip with us.
6167863	6169784	I'm glad it's worked for you.
6170365	6172146	I'm sure other people have had similar issues.
6173680	6192065	Yeah, and, um, other than that, my original DS, well, the second DS light I've ever owned, started to completely fail on me, and ended up spending, well, going broke, really, on a new DS light, and it was actually the last one in the batch.
6192545	6201307	But it was well worth it, with Pokemon HeartGold, which is kind of a, I don't know, basically just HeartGold with the crystal
6202515	6206920	and yellow features sort of slapped into it with new DS graphics.
6207080	6207921	Well, that's pretty cool.
6208021	6211605	But I'll tell you what, we're getting other calls in, so I need to go ahead and let you go.
6211886	6212727	Thank you for calling.
6213167	6215049	Otherwise, I do give it a 10 out of 10.
6215390	6216531	Okay, thank you for calling.
6216631	6217252	Bye-bye.
6221376	6222698	I think that was DS Master.
6224801	6226642	And I am super professional.
6227422	6228763	Osfer says I'm super professional.
6228803	6238448	Let's make sure that we haven't... I'm going to see if I can't get Marin off of... Are you there?
6239049	6239629	Yes, I am.
6239849	6242611	Okay, so this is what we're going to do now for future calls.
6242771	6247293	I want people to... I'm going to add the conference.
6247673	6248334	Aha!
6248734	6249354	It worked.
6250095	6251675	Hello, who are we talking to?
6253717	6254217	Clark.
6254824	6258045	Anyway, hello you across the ocean.
6258625	6260785	Hello, Aki Ripper, how are you?
6262226	6265286	I'm doing just fine on this Monday morning.
6266347	6268207	And we do have Tara on the line still too.
6268247	6269307	Monday morning?
6269387	6270527	Are you from the future?
6272488	6275028	No, I just live in this place called Sweden.
6276409	6278729	It's the future in Sweden.
6278929	6280190	I'm like, well, what is it?
6280270	6281830	I'm eight hours ahead of you.
6283188	6284749	That means you are from the future.
6284929	6286109	You are from the future.
6287990	6289811	What's the future like?
6289951	6290791	Is it beautiful?
6291151	6292231	Are there flying cars?
6292772	6293852	Tell us, I must know.
6295153	6296513	No, nothing of that yet.
6297514	6298154	Unfortunately.
6299154	6301375	But since you're in Sweden, you have awesome chocolate, right?
6304536	6305316	No, I don't.
6305517	6306197	No, no, no, no.
6306237	6309098	You're thinking of like Switzerland or Switzerland.
6310285	6312126	What does Sweden have that's awesome?
6312266	6313287	Tell us about Sweden.
6314728	6316189	What do we have that's awesome?
6316950	6323214	Well, we... Oh, that's like... We have... What do we have?
6323354	6327177	Well... Damn!
6327337	6328438	Prostitution?
6329359	6331060	Oh, okay.
6331080	6332221	Cotton hookers!
6334102	6335843	We have prostitution in Las Vegas.
6335863	6337104	That's Amsterdam, sorry.
6337124	6337845	Oh, whatever.
6339201	6340762	But anyways, what's on your mind, dude?
6341883	6344644	Oh, well, what did I call?
6344764	6349487	Oh, well, something of some sort.
6350667	6351068	Crap.
6352068	6353369	Oh, yeah.
6354109	6355490	You forgot to talk about something.
6356771	6360733	Dragon Age Ultimate Edition is coming soon.
6363094	6365776	Well, somewhere around December or something.
6366836	6374422	and, well, the funny thing is that I've just been reminded I did buy Dragon Age on launch day and I haven't played it.
6374782	6384429	The reason I've just been reminded is that I play it on a PC and, funny story is that my computer that I play it on, you can unlock it.
6386270	6396217	You can unlock all the four cores since two of them is disabled by default of sorts and that makes Dragon Age load up pretty fast
6398158	6417474	but then the two cores was really faulty so I had to disable them and then I was like I don't want to play this slow loading game so I'm going to play it when I have a quad core and I still don't have a quad core so I'm just going to wait even more.
6418411	6424012	I think you should just suck it up and play the game, because Dragon Age Origins is an awesome game.
6424072	6426873	It's the best game ever, and you're really missing out.
6427493	6430654	See, you have Dragon Age Origins in Sweden.
6430714	6433095	That's what you have, but you are neglecting it.
6434655	6443077	Well, to be honest, I'm playing that thing called Sims 3, and I'm eagerly waiting Nightlife.
6444269	6445689	Yeah, that's going to be fun.
6446150	6448510	I'm probably going to get it well after everybody else has had it.
6449431	6453732	The chat room also would like to inform us that Sweden has IKEA.
6455352	6456052	Yes.
6457073	6463695	Yeah, but where I live, where I live in Sweden, we don't.
6466415	6469816	We have it, but I have to go like, well, what is it?
6471397	6471637	Two
6472346	6478648	Well, because I'm like one of those, in some way, uneducated bastards that lives in a cave of sorts.
6499195	6500776	That's okay, you're like the rest of us.
6502978	6509324	Where we live in our caves called our computer rooms and don't come out except when we need to eat and go to the bathroom.
6510285	6514068	Yeah, that's like one up on this one, too.
6516410	6518552	So, I have a challenge for you.
6519433	6520334	I have a challenge for you.
6520394	6524177	By the end of the month, you must start Dragon Age Origins.
6524878	6525118	Yes.
6525378	6526339	Yeah, well...
6527509	6534311	Well, that's... That's not... Well, that... Because of the thing, though, in one way, actually, I've been reminded.
6534611	6547934	I have played it, it's just that... It's just that I want to play the... Well, I have, like, played a few of the origin stories, and then afterwards I just get bored by some strange reason.
6550095	6551455	So you have gamer ADD.
6553601	6559606	Yeah, well, and I actually have a real ADD too, so That would contribute.
6559906	6562688	If we are to go be that way.
6563769	6564629	That would contribute.
6565070	6568292	Well, Aki Ripper, I appreciate the call.
6568312	6569453	Are we doing okay without Rob?
6571735	6573576	Yeah, you're doing just fine.
6574257	6581302	Because, well, in some way I would say more of this in the future, please, even though it's like
6581926	6596753	Sorry, Rob, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, yeah, that's the way, yeah, something, I don't know, I'm just this worthless foreigner of whatever, I'll just, oh.
6597413	6599674	Oh, you are not a worthless foreigner, we adore you.
6600114	6603095	But we need to go ahead and let you go, we've got another call coming in, okay?
6603115	6604816	Yeah, later.
6605256	6605596	Take care.
6605616	6605817	Bye-bye.
6609090	6609850	Hello, caller.
6610831	6612031	You are on Orange Jones Radio.
6612131	6612791	Who be thee?
6614432	6616533	I be DDR Dollar Bill.
6616553	6616593	Hi.
6616973	6619534	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
6619634	6620675	What's on your mind?
6621555	6622615	Oh, nothing much.
6623656	6627537	I just want to give an update about the PlayStation 3 that I got a couple weeks back.
6629398	6630459	I finally purchased it.
6631679	6632119	Yay.
6632900	6633300	Yeah.
6633320	6634000	Congrats.
6634040	6635060	What's that?
6635120	6636601	I said congrats.
6637541	6637982	Oh, thanks.
6638142	6638422	Thanks.
6638582	6638702	It's
6639443	6643325	It's a lot better to watch DVDs on there, I'll give you that much.
6645606	6648367	But the move, I didn't like it at all.
6650368	6657371	I found out that you asked for me, I actually have to be about six feet away from the TV, and unfortunately I don't have that much room in my apartment.
6659131	6660092	Oh, that sucks.
6661152	6669696	Yeah, so, I mean, I went forward, and it stopped detecting, and I was only, like, maybe four feet away from the screen, and I said, uh, no, this is not gonna work.
6670576	6673978	Is there any way that you could wall mount, like, a receptor or something?
6675698	6678980	I'd have, well... I think you should mount it onto your ceiling.
6681221	6683502	That's at least six feet away, right?
6684682	6686523	I'd have to lay down on the floor to do that, though.
6689386	6691007	I'd be laying on the floor waving my stick.
6691348	6692489	Wait, that doesn't look right at all.
6693409	6694190	Well then.
6696952	6704539	Yeah, but I just wanted to say that, and I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it for one big reason.
6705420	6708262	No fucking batteries on the controllers.
6710304	6713827	It was such a joy just to actually plug in the controllers, get it going.
6713847	6715348	Alright, we got multiplayer.
6716489	6717430	That's always a plus.
6718673	6725018	Yeah, so... So let's... Hold on a second.
6726259	6726719	There we go.
6726779	6727080	I'm sorry.
6727100	6728421	I'm hearing myself repeat myself.
6728441	6730342	You had to do what to yourself?
6731103	6733284	No, I was hearing my voice coming in an echo.
6733344	6735746	I was like, why?
6736106	6739549	Maybe you've got your... You're too close to your speakers or something to that effect?
6740210	6742051	You have to be at least six feet away.
6743612	6746174	You must be at least six feet away to enjoy this podcast.
6748843	6753824	Yeah, so the biggest hits so far in the household is LittleBigPlanet and ModNation Racers.
6755864	6757345	How do you like ModNation Racers?
6757405	6758605	I've been meaning to play that.
6759965	6762766	Okay, before I go into it, I'm going to say this again.
6762786	6764166	This is the sole disclaimer.
6765766	6770367	I thought Super Mario Kart on the SNES was the biggest piece of shit that ever existed.
6771847	6772487	I'm sorry.
6772507	6775508	I thought the controls sucked horribly and the perspective just...
6776019	6776419	Oh, exactly.
6776439	6777320	You know.
6801775	6806121	And especially when they can't just design their own characters and cars and even tracks.
6807423	6812850	When they start doing the tracks, that's going to be a lot more fun because we can just recreate anything we want.
6813611	6817076	Especially around New York, we got no shortage of tracks to replicate.
6818496	6819817	So I need to ask you something.
6820357	6820617	Yes.
6820937	6822198	As a dude, I have to ask you this.
6822919	6823179	Okay.
6823219	6826021	What is it about being able to customize your characters?
6826101	6827802	Isn't that a lot like Barbie dolls for dudes?
6830184	6830964	Like, okay.
6831945	6837389	When we have all these wrestling games and my husband would like try to, you know, make the wrestlers look all cool and stuff.
6837409	6838890	I'm like, dude, it's like you're playing dress up.
6840050	6840631	It really is.
6842313	6844374	In essence, you're halfway right.
6844454	6847474	It is kind of like doing Barbie, but... But it's manly Barbie.
6847874	6849895	And wrestling is like soap opera for dudes.
6850395	6850695	It is.
6852355	6853316	Oh, no disagreements.
6854636	6857257	Oh, he got her drunk and they got married!
6857397	6857957	Oh no!
6858917	6859997	Triple H. Sorry.
6863858	6866399	Look, I'm coming back from the dead again.
6868459	6871060	Oh, now it's the underbiker.
6872723	6876065	No, he's back to Undertaker, like the dead guy again.
6876125	6877666	He was a biker for a while though.
6877686	6879527	That's right, but the underbiker was.
6880007	6881067	Now we're on wrestling, sorry.
6882468	6883989	It's alright, he lost tonight anyway.
6884549	6885069	Oh really?
6885590	6887871	It's been that long, I'm like, I don't know who any of these people are anymore.
6887891	6890832	That's terrible that they wrote that into the script, that he would lose.
6892293	6894314	He lost by getting hit with the urn.
6895494	6895715	What?
6895915	6899056	They wrote that all back in there, they're going way back.
6899496	6899837	Wow.
6899877	6900357	Wow.
6901075	6902696	Yeah.
6902716	6903396	They went backwards.
6903977	6914162	Given that I remember playing Wrestlemania in the arcade and you could choose The Undertaker when I was a kid Oh yeah.
6914202	6915623	The underbiker needs to retire.
6917544	6919245	You're not the only one who's saying that.
6919545	6919845	Yeah.
6920714	6930377	Well, anyway, so now, thank you for clearing this up for me, because I've always wondered if it's just the same sort of little giddy joy in making them look pretty.
6930997	6932238	Like, pretty, pretty ponies.
6933138	6942741	Just to add to it, in the wrestling games, it's also a joy now where you can actually create your own finishers, so now it's not just, ooh, they look pretty, like, ooh, I can kick your ass pretty!
6943662	6947303	That's... I've never heard someone say, I can kick your ass pretty.
6947323	6947903	Ha ha!
6949289	6950830	I don't know, just going with the thought.
6951511	6954694	Did you ever play WrestleMania 2000 on Nintendo 64?
6955435	6955675	Yes.
6956616	6963982	I played that, and I made this guy who was part of D-Generation X, and we would just put him on watch mode, and he beat everybody.
6964043	6966285	He won every belt, including the women's belt.
6969908	6970488	Oh, gosh.
6970508	6971389	When the AI was actually that
6972580	6973461	easily manipulative.
6973761	6974121	Nice.
6974562	6975162	Exactly.
6975622	6977464	Anyway, this isn't wrestling chat.
6977544	6978925	This is Orange Ons Radio.
6979666	6980006	Agreed.
6980126	6983228	Video games, but... Are you sure about that?
6983629	6984690	Sometimes.
6985030	6987912	We talked about food in Part A. We did already get our food out of our system.
6988392	6989433	That sounds bad.
6989493	6991995	That's more like what we do during the break is get our food out of our system.
6993256	6994878	Speaking of which, I got my pizza here to eat too.
6995898	6997159	Why don't we let you get to your pizza?
6997800	6999741	What kind of pizza do you have?
7001163	7001583	Take care.
7001969	7026710	alright, you too bye pizza and wrestling so reminds me of my early years with my husband how romantic well, you know how we got engaged was watching UHF and drinking Manischewitz wine, which should have set a precedence there yep so, do we have any other callers?
7026830	7030073	because if you don't, I'm closing the line and you're all SOL
7032252	7034793	5, 4... Misty is supposed to call.
7034873	7035713	Call, Misty!
7035873	7037073	Misty, call!
7037393	7038474	You must call.
7038754	7039834	You must call.
7039974	7041014	Or we'll call you.
7041354	7043895	Conferencing you in in just about a minute.
7043975	7044495	Are you on?
7046276	7047976	Ooh, she's sneaky.
7050677	7053698	I do not see her in the list of people who are on the lines.
7054518	7054638	Aww.
7057092	7057912	Oh, there we go.
7058012	7059053	Let's see.
7060573	7062933	Nope, I do not see a Misty.
7063754	7064234	Call us!
7065874	7066394	Call us.
7067795	7070355	Oh, we got another one in, but it's not Misty.
7070375	7071255	Let's see who this is.
7072056	7075156	Hello, you're on Orange Jones Radio.
7075436	7077417	Who are you whoring yourself out today?
7078470	7081833	I'm whoring myself to whoever has the highest amount of money for me.
7082013	7082914	Oh baby, oh baby.
7083474	7084515	Hi Ranma.
7084935	7086016	Hey, hey, what's up?
7086457	7087698	Hi Ranchan.
7088518	7090160	Ranchan, oh hi.
7090180	7092562	We see what you did there.
7093743	7094463	No, I do try.
7095524	7096765	How are you doing today?
7097826	7098887	I am doing good.
7098927	7107434	Would you believe I just finished editing my podcast to get it and it's... Huh?
7111013	7112074	Did we lose him?
7112474	7112995	Oh, here we go.
7113035	7113695	Sorry about that.
7113715	7114916	I hit the mute button by accident.
7115116	7115436	Oops.
7116116	7118117	Remember, don't hit the mute button.
7118698	7124541	Never hit the mute button, because then you'll end up sounding like this while you're trying to talk.
7124681	7126242	And right, we can't have that now.
7126622	7129144	No.
7129284	7139650	Just finished editing our podcast, and it just went upline, and I'm looking at all the emails of all the gaming demos that's going on at New York Anime Festival slash Comic Con this weekend.
7140459	7141239	Ooh, do tell.
7142960	7147461	Okay, first email I got is from the people behind DC Universe.
7148041	7151022	Ooh!
7151042	7152382	Which is also interesting.
7154323	7157644	The Marvel Super Hero MMO will be playable as well.
7158204	7159364	Yay!
7160345	7161965	I'm looking at a graphic of it.
7162025	7165326	It's pretty much the Marvel Super Hero Squad online game.
7165366	7166126	Looks interesting.
7166666	7167667	Aw, that's cute.
7167747	7168707	That should be adorable.
7169909	7170569	Definitely.
7171070	7175091	And I also got an email from Sega, so they'll be showing off the new Thor game.
7176012	7176672	Oh, cool.
7178273	7183435	And I am curious about DC Online, because this will be the second time I've ever played a PS3 in my entire life.
7185656	7185936	Really?
7186696	7191798	Yeah, first time I played it was at some gaming con, and I played it on Street Fighter 4.
7192059	7193639	Only thing that annoyed me was the load time.
7194179	7194540	Yeah.
7195960	7197081	I much prefer that on Xbox.
7199312	7205956	As do I. It's funny though, I only bought Street Fighter 4 only because I know the person that does the voice of Ryu in the game.
7206276	7206556	Really?
7207177	7207417	Yes.
7209318	7209718	Who is it?
7209738	7211959	I mean, what other stuff has he done that I would recognize?
7213040	7217722	His name is Kyle Hebert, and did you ever watch the dub Dragon Ball Z?
7218423	7220264	I tried not to, but I have it sometimes.
7221164	7222685	He did the voice of Adult Gohan.
7223506	7223626	Oh!
7224066	7224967	Oh, okay.
7225007	7226467	He was actually one of the ones that wasn't annoying.
7227228	7227468	Mm-hmm.
7229746	7233168	Of the very few that were not annoying, he was one of them.
7236109	7242412	He wasn't the older adult Gohan when Viz and Pioneer dubbed it.
7242452	7245393	He was part of the Funimation cast when they redubbed the series.
7246753	7253116	I pieced it together when you said it because I remembered Ryu's English voice.
7254269	7259970	Okay, and that and I don't remember how many episodes they dubbed before Funimation took over.
7260030	7261451	It's just like a giant blur to me.
7262931	7264652	Dragon Ball Z is a giant blur to me.
7265692	7275934	Well, with Dragon Ball Kai, which is supposed to be more of the manga-based version, or I like to call it Dragon Ball Z Kai, less filler reps, still tastes great.
7277595	7278375	That's pretty funny.
7278795	7282116	So the battle with Cell only takes like five episodes instead of 73 episodes?
7283578	7284259	Pretty much.
7284959	7285480	Pretty much.
7287021	7297890	Seriously, when I had my fan subs of the Cell episodes, they were seriously over four VHS tapes at whatever the long play was.
7298391	7298791	SLP.
7298871	7299191	Wow.
7300753	7301093	Yeah.
7302034	7302814	That's way too much.
7303095	7303295	Wow.
7304690	7310352	I remember the first time I watched the Phantom of Dragon Ball Z. Me and my cousin were at his grandmother's house watching it.
7310552	7319676	And it was third or fourth generation VHS tape because as we're watching it, the video quality was so bad that it would just flip to a blue screen like every three minutes.
7319716	7325298	And we're just sitting there glued to the TV watching every single minute of it.
7325498	7328039	That sounds like my first experience is watching Ranma 1.5.
7331532	7336493	My first copies were fansubs from the Ranma Project, about four or five generations old.
7339434	7346956	I remember there was this comic book shop I used to periodically hang out at, and they actually had the fansub copies.
7347836	7349676	But the thing is, I didn't like the price he was offering.
7349696	7352337	He was like, two episodes for like 20 bucks.
7352417	7354137	I'm like, no, that can stay on the shelf.
7354437	7357238	I remember the old days when he traded fansubs.
7359238	7360018	I remember that.
7361099	7361839	Ah, memories.
7362619	7364700	I still have all my fansubs in storage.
7365080	7366440	Now we download them off the internet.
7368881	7370341	Shh, shh, don't say that.
7370621	7372422	We're not supposed to.
7373202	7375143	How else am I going to get my Digimon fix?
7376503	7380224	Well, did you know they actually... I'm watching the new series of Digimon.
7380244	7381544	...refansubbed on Digimon?
7382405	7387126	Uh, don't... Don't get me started.
7388908	7389889	So how about more video games?
7389909	7391330	I do like Butterfly, the opening theme.
7392351	7393692	How about more video games?
7393732	7394592	What else is going to be up there?
7395813	7396774	That's basically it.
7396794	7398715	That's all the information I have here.
7400476	7404299	Also, there's another company called Game Tech that's supposed to be there.
7404619	7410923	They're probably doing these little flash-based games or something like that.
7410983	7411984	That's my assumption.
7412164	7414826	They're not saying too much about it.
7415026	7418128	They're going to be the Kentia Hall of your convention.
7421277	7433063	To be perfectly honest, the Kensha Hall of Comic Con is like the little room in the back where it's open gaming and then people try to get up on stage and make fools of themselves.
7433803	7437405	That's always the best part of cons is people making fools of themselves in costume.
7439726	7441107	I'll definitely be in costume.
7441567	7449211	Speaking of in costume, I am looking for pieces for a River Song cosplay from
7449813	7459798	The end of the last Doctor Who series, so if you know somebody who can help me out with finding some pieces for that, I would be much appreciative.
7461439	7469022	I'm probably the minority in my group that does not watch Doctor Who, only because I have so much stuff on my plate to watch I have no time for it.
7469623	7470663	Tsk, tsk, tsk.
7472324	7476166	Hey, if it helps, I watched some of the original stuff from the 60s and the 70s.
7477226	7478267	That's what I grew up on.
7479684	7480585	on public access.
7480765	7482567	Fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.
7484088	7500482	Okay, well, if Ron-chan can't help me, somebody on the interwebs that is hearing this, the tens of people who listen to this show, there are a lot, so if you would like to help me out with some River Song cosplay so that I can go to the Laguna Beach Comic Con, is that the one?
7500522	7503224	No, I'm going to Long Beach Comic Con at the end of this month, so...
7504429	7506570	In the old home of Anime Expo.
7507290	7507490	Yes.
7508130	7509190	Oh, I remember that place.
7509230	7515392	And I remember walking all over that section of Long Beach in four-inch platform heels.
7516872	7517312	Not fun.
7518092	7518693	Not smart.
7519393	7520533	No, but I was cosplaying.
7522013	7525494	For the record, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter from Angel Sanctuary.
7526074	7527095	Okay.
7527235	7530496	Hence the boots and walking around in wings in a crowded dealer's room.
7530736	7531296	Not smart.
7531416	7532056	I didn't do it again.
7534090	7536350	Well Tiara, I can't say this much.
7536490	7543112	I actually do know a couple of people out in the Vegas area that are cosplayers, so I may be able to cash in a favor or two.
7546773	7554794	If one of them is somebody that I think it is, that might be a creepy person from high school that I went to high school with, so maybe not.
7556795	7557695	Male or female?
7558155	7558415	Male.
7559534	7560735	You're in luck, they're all females.
7560775	7563978	Most of the cosplayers I know and commissioners are female, so you're good.
7563998	7564458	Okay, good.
7564838	7565359	Okay, good.
7567361	7568442	I got you, I got you.
7569923	7571104	No creeps for you today.
7571624	7574447	Yay, one day creep free.
7574587	7577109	Except when DS Master called in.
7579631	7580812	Well, I missed that call, so.
7581252	7582373	That's right, you were on hold.
7582393	7582453	Yep.
7582894	7583114	Yep.
7584862	7589444	Well, Ranchan, thank you for your call, and you need to get your ass back out here soon.
7590245	7596507	As soon as I get some cash monies, me and Joe, Daya, and Missy will come out there and invade for a weekend or two or three.
7596527	7600669	Or everybody compile and get me out there, because I don't want to be in California.
7601270	7602970	Yeah, I want to go to New York.
7602990	7606572	Yeah, we need to make the Send Jamie and Tiara to New York fund.
7607062	7615491	Yeah, and DDR Dollar Bill said I should ship myself there, but I don't know how many air holes I would need, so I'm not sure if that would work.
7615511	7615491	32.
7616351	7617613	32?
7616492	7617613	Okay.
7618213	7625841	Not to mention that they put you in one of those non-compressed compartments and you'll freeze to death, so that's not good.
7626021	7626922	That would kind of suck.
7627603	7629024	Oh, hey, Loki, when did you show up?
7629965	7630466	Oh, I've been here.
7630953	7631433	Oh, okay.
7631453	7634975	He's been looking at porn and playing the magical unicorn fart game.
7635395	7637416	I've been doing either of those, but yes.
7637997	7640258	That would explain why the stream went out.
7640558	7641238	Bad Loki.
7641418	7641779	Bad Loki.
7641819	7644700	No, it went out from spam overload from the email.
7645701	7645861	Eep.
7647522	7647762	Yeah.
7648442	7650803	So, do you have anything else for us?
7650823	7653725	Give us more.
7654665	7655846	No, that's pretty much it.
7655886	7656006	Yeah.
7656368	7660869	Alright, well we are going to let you go reluctantly, reluctantly.
7661929	7665010	So, take care and thank you for calling in.
7665950	7666411	Anytime.
7666631	7667371	Fantabulous.
7668151	7668891	Bye-bye.
7668911	7669851	Bye.
7671892	7673632	Okay, I think that we're about called out.
7673672	7683295	I'm going to leave room for one more call and if not, then we'll go ahead and ask for any last minute stories and wrap the show up in ribbons and bows and call it pretty.
7684165	7685386	Yay, so pretty.
7685866	7687948	Shadowrunner says someone should cosplay Billy Mitchell.
7690049	7696534	You know what, all that makes me do is when I hear the scout doing the Slap Chop commercial.
7701558	7702659	Hold on, somebody fill time.
7704520	7705881	Time, fill, woo!
7706324	7706965	Oh, I know.
7707365	7708647	It's Misty's birthday.
7708927	7710349	We should say happy birthday to Misty.
7710369	7711510	Happy birthday, Misty.
7711991	7713813	Happy birthday to you.
7713953	7715655	Happy birthday to you.
7715795	7717657	Happy birthday, dear Misty.
7717777	7719299	Happy birthday to you.
7720100	7721421	Yay!
7721501	7722322	Now send us cake.
7722823	7724485	Fresh, fresh cake.
7724885	7725486	Yes, cake.
7725746	7726347	Or cupcakes.
7727415	7728556	I love cupcakes.
7728836	7729516	Me too.
7730257	7731077	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
7731178	7734980	Ranma's telling everyone to tell GFDia to call in and do coffee talk.
7737102	7738743	Coffee talk with Jamie and Tiara.
7740524	7741104	Give us a call.
7741124	7741565	We'll talk.
7741645	7742145	No big whoop.
7745767	7747669	That Madonna is such a skank.
7749960	7751320	That was my favorite coffee talk.
7752901	7755061	With Madonna and Roseanne Barr.
7755542	7757082	And then Barbara showed up.
7757562	7758542	Because she's like, butter.
7761423	7762543	Okay, I'm still trying to find this.
7762563	7762804	Hold on.
7768445	7769145	I can't find it.
7769225	7769645	Where is it?
7770766	7773807	Shadowrunner says, the cake is a lie, but pie is constant.
7774567	7775167	This is true.
7775787	7776347	That is true.
7777888	7778868	Pie is constant.
7782541	7809200	I can't spell today Well, last minute stories I guess Yes please Retailers are apparently listing Duke Nukem Forever for February 1st I can tell you right now that's just an estimate Because they haven't really given out the exact release date yet I'm assuming it's February though Because we have it listed in February as well But not the 1st Because that would be wrong Well, here I've loaded this up Oh, we've got another call coming in, hold on
7810612	7811953	Let me add them to our call.
7812453	7814474	Hello, you're calling in Orange Lodge Radio.
7814635	7815475	Who is this?
7817176	7818677	This is Gio Vidal.
7819378	7820598	Hi!
7820778	7821459	Hello.
7821479	7822520	How are you?
7823280	7824281	You've called.
7824641	7826122	Now we can talk.
7826982	7832906	We can talk, so we can have... We can discuss.
7833366	7834047	We can be done.
7834067	7835168	We can has-hasing.
7835748	7835988	Okay.
7840115	7842876	Ah, so how are you?
7848137	7849537	Why did your nose hurt?
7851278	7852358	Um, I pierced my symptom.
7853698	7854078	Fun!
7855338	7857719	That sounds about as fun as putting a hole in your face.
7857739	7861920	Something like that.
7862780	7864800	Why did you go and do a silly thing like this?
7866881	7866941	Um...
7869013	7870594	I had the time and I had the money.
7871554	7874075	If you've got the time and money, you should just come out here.
7874715	7875235	Exactly.
7875255	7876955	I know.
7877176	7878196	It's less painful.
7878976	7885078	Well, I was on a weekend vacation at a barbecue competition thing.
7885098	7887399	It was at the beach, so I did it.
7888119	7890480	And I just, it's a weekend.
7890640	7893501	It's not being able to go out to California.
7894561	7898062	Well, if everybody else put holes in their noses with you too, oh, I guess you did.
7904250	7906192	So what's going on on your gaming front?
7908394	7912437	I'm actually trying to play through the Lego games again.
7913318	7914879	Oh, which one are you playing?
7914939	7915600	I went through.
7915620	7917962	I'm trying to play through Batman now.
7918702	7920544	Lego Batman is so much fun.
7920604	7921465	I love that game.
7921745	7923226	It absolutely is.
7924027	7925528	I'm having so much fun with it.
7926469	7929051	And it's just, it's absolutely ridiculous.
7929611	7931033	It's fantastic, innocent fun.
7934420	7938783	I think Lego Indiana Jones is still my favorite though, but I have a soft spot for Indy.
7939903	7942545	Even though he's old and walking around with a cane.
7942825	7947648	Yeah, I have that for the DS, and I like the dumb DS.
7947668	7953352	I have Batman for the DS too, and I played that like crazy, so now I'm just trying to get through everything on the 360.
7954052	7955213	Did you play through Arkham Asylum?
7957413	7958475	No, I haven't.
7958675	7959837	I do not have it.
7959957	7963762	I'm trying to wait for it to come down in price and find it down at price.
7964503	7966666	If I can find it cheap, I will send you a copy.
7967487	7966666	$39.99.
7967948	7970852	If I can find it cheap at you somewhere, I will find you a copy.
7972334	7972574	Okay.
7974063	7975103	It's really worthwhile.
7975143	7981968	In fact, I think I saw it at one of our local used music and game stores for like $20.
7982028	7983809	I want to say.
7984390	7985791	We'll work out something after the show.
7985971	7986672	You can PayPal me.
7987132	7987552	Okay.
7988333	7988653	Alright.
7988893	7989473	That sounds good.
7990754	7992936	Even though I still have to send a soundboard to Tiara.
7994017	7994297	Oops.
7995498	7997739	I still have stuff to mail you too, so it's okay.
7998680	8000281	And you only sound vaguely Atlantean.
8001022	8001222	Yes.
8001242	8001302	Yes.
8002927	8032021	so well I totally I totally suggest the Arkham Asylum game it's pretty fun and you can also just go around and the best thing to do in that game is to get up on the gargoyle heads in some of these areas and then drop down behind people upside down all crazy like and you pick them up and beat the crap out of them and drop them down it's just awesome Batman it's so fun I know see that's the kind of stuff that I do in Metal Gear I just go up behind people and just like strangle them and snap their necks it's
8032620	8035841	See, now in my head I've got Rob's voice going, LOL, you're dead.
8037062	8041584	That's the kind of crap that I do in video games, though.
8042124	8042985	I like that stuff.
8043005	8043965	You like the ninja.
8045265	8046306	Yes, yes.
8047326	8050028	I think that makes me a little violent, but that's okay.
8050468	8051248	There's nothing wrong with that.
8051268	8052629	You have to blow off steam somehow.
8054069	8054950	Yeah, exactly.
8056130	8060212	So I do it on video games and kill people and knife them to death.
8061124	8063525	Because we know the difference between gaming and reality.
8064605	8067987	And as much as we imagine doing it to people in real life, we do not actually do it.
8070228	8073369	No, we just wish that the video games were real sometimes.
8073769	8076410	DDRDollarBill says, remind me not to piss her off ever.
8077070	8079131	And doesn't want to have this next snap silently.
8081932	8083633	Yes, let's not do that for reals.
8084813	8088735	Or what was the line in Silence Good, but let's play Metal Gear for real.
8092748	8093209	Alright.
8094090	8098033	Well, do you have anything else that you wish to discuss with us?
8099534	8099934	No.
8100535	8102757	I was just calling in to say hi, basically.
8103097	8103617	Well, hello.
8103677	8104578	We're glad that you called.
8105219	8105759	Yes, indeed.
8107741	8108241	Batman!
8109422	8110163	He's Batman.
8111704	8112585	I'm Batman.
8112925	8114887	Well, you take care, and we will end it on Batman.
8116668	8117389	Batman!
8118049	8119711	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na phone call!
8121012	8127755	Okay, that's it for Skype.
8127815	8136918	I'm going to go ahead and go on the Do Not Disturb because I will not answer any more of your insolence questions.
8136998	8137999	Do not disturb.
8138439	8140459	I will no longer respond to your insolence.
8143501	8143841	I'm done.
8143861	8145301	Do you have any more last minute stories for us, Loki?
8146102	8146602	No.
8147662	8149342	Tiara, do you have any last minute stories?
8150043	8150603	I do not.
8151183	8153403	So how about last minute thoughts?
8153604	8154504	Wait, last thoughts.
8154604	8155604	Loki, any final?
8155804	8156504	My head hurts.
8156724	8160305	Baby's sleeping right now and that means he's going to be up at night.
8160965	8164746	My head hurts even more knowing that I have to get up at probably 3 in the morning this time.
8167407	8169508	Time to break out the Vicodin.
8170508	8172088	I can't swallow pills so that doesn't work.
8173549	8174889	We'll put it on your pizza.
8177688	8181792	And Tiara, for you, any last minute thoughts?
8182753	8184575	Happy Spocktober, everyone!
8186617	8188639	That makes me all warm and fuzzy and logical.
8190441	8194945	And my final thought is... Taco Salad defeated!
8195586	8196547	Dun-dun-dun!
8198314	8205399	Alright everybody, well that's been this episode of Orange Lounge Radio sans Rob who never did make an appearance.
8206299	8208121	How dare he not make an appearance.
8208861	8209922	Goodnight everybody!
8211711	8212251	See you next week!
