00:00.000 --> 00:20.240
Tonight, October 24th, 2010, two Capcom worlds collide in an upcoming 3DS game, fans of Sonic

00:20.240 --> 00:24.960
the Hedgehog up the ante in the new HD version, and in one country, Grand Theft Auto IV is

00:24.960 --> 00:31.720
ordered off the shelves.

00:31.720 --> 00:36.120
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
Radio.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.080
We are that radio video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.120
We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.460
www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:50.460 --> 00:54.640
Joining you over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-hosts.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.640
Say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.640
Storms lol.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.640
I know right.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.360
Yeah, we're having storms right now.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.960
We're having rain and nobody in California knows how to deal with it.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, we had to do a disclaimer for live listeners because one of the people that doesn't know

01:08.000 --> 01:11.440
how to handle storms is Comcast, the internet provider out here in Sacramento.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
Exactly.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.000
And so the internet has cut out at your house, what, five times today at least?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.920
I know at home it's been cutting in and out.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.440
Three times since I've been awake.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.480
I just got a text from Alan saying it cut out again while he was trying to listen to

01:23.480 --> 01:25.760
our call with Bobby before the show tonight.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.760
Which is funny because in Alabama I remember being on dial-up in a hurricane.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.920
I just don't know how to handle it out here.

01:32.920 --> 01:33.920
They really don't.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.840
And what makes it worse too is that, not to get too off kilter here, but what makes it

01:37.840 --> 01:43.040
worse is that when you have this first major rain of the season as it finally is, here

01:43.040 --> 01:46.560
we are the end of October, the problem is everything is so dried out from a long summer

01:46.560 --> 01:48.560
that it just screws everything up.

01:48.560 --> 01:53.240
And the oil floats all up to the top of the streets and it becomes a big slick and no

01:53.240 --> 01:56.440
one knows how to drive in the rain.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.440
But it's been raining for almost, it feels like a day straight.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.440
It rained yesterday almost all day.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
Crazy.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
I've enjoyed it.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.440
I like the rain.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
But I've been sick.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.640
So I like rain when I'm sick because then it makes all the warm food I'm eating so much

02:08.640 --> 02:09.640
better.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.400
And then just everybody else is having to be miserable because you're miserable, right?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.000
No, I'm good because I spend most of the time asleep.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Really?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Because that's how I am.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.600
I'm like, if I'm sick then I want everyone to be sick.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.320
When Dan gets sick he's a big baby.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.480
He just curls up on the couch and makes pathetic faces at me.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.240
Is that what your cat does too?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.760
She's sitting on your feet right now kind of.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.760
She's purring.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
All right.

02:31.760 --> 02:36.080
Say hello of course to tech master Loki also joining us tonight as he always does.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
Hello.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
And complete with what?

02:38.080 --> 02:39.720
Are we on quadruple bacon pizza now?

02:39.720 --> 02:40.720
Not yet.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.320
I didn't want to scare them with the thought of putting in four times the amount of bacon

02:44.320 --> 02:45.320
on a pizza.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.320
They'd have to make you sign a medical disclaimer.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.840
I'd eat them into that, you know.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.840
All right.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
How have things been for you?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.040
How's the baby doing?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.040
Baby is fine.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.760
He's, he was with mom going to her parents' house.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.960
Now where's that?

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
Is that in the bay?

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
Folsom.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
Oh, okay.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
That's not that bad.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Is he pooping fine?

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
Yeah, he's pooping just fine.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
Okay.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
Because I remember the poop scare.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
Inquiring minds.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.960
Want to know.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
All right.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.960
Joining us in studio tonight, yes, in studio, not on Skype.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.420
We love having guests actually come down to the studio and hang with us.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.000
Say hello to our pal, the Seg.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Hello, O-L-R.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Hello, Seg.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.520
Wonderful to be here.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.520
Wonderful to have you.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.120
Thank you so much for coming out here.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.980
I haven't really had a chance to say it to you before we've gone live because it's just

03:31.980 --> 03:32.980
been go, go, go, go.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.640
Cause I was running in the door late tonight, but, um, but I did get a new mic cord for

03:36.640 --> 03:38.280
Dark Sakura, so it wasn't all for naught.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.120
So just saying, hopefully it works tonight.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.400
I'm not having to hold it in.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
That's what she said.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
All right.

03:45.400 --> 03:49.160
So anyway, but, uh, say you, you drove all the way here from the Bay area, which is a

03:49.160 --> 03:52.080
good, well, usually it's probably about an hour and a half, but I'm going to guess because

03:52.080 --> 03:57.000
of the rain, it probably took like an hour and a half, you know, I am from Detroit, so

03:57.000 --> 04:05.320
I actually know how to drive, you know, Ford family here, so, well, regardless, no matter

04:05.320 --> 04:07.800
how long it took you to get here, it is quite a bit of a tank of gas.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.880
So I do really appreciate you coming out and hanging here in studio with us.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.280
Not quite as glamorous as the sounds on the radio, huh?

04:14.280 --> 04:18.760
Well, you know, you don't have to, to, to pull back the curtain for everyone out there

04:18.760 --> 04:19.760
on the internet.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
Yeah, that's all right.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
All right.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.760
Yeah.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
I meant, uh, of course our microphones are all gold-plated.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.240
This couch is absolutely wonderful.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
Maho, maho.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.000
Give me, give me more grapes, servants.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
All right.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.440
Uh, well, Saig, you are here though.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.840
Of course you have ulterior motives for being here tonight.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
Not that we mind.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.480
We appreciate a reason to have you here in house, but you're here to promote a little

04:39.480 --> 04:41.120
something something that's going on, right?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.120
Yeah.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.120
Just, just a little something.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.640
You might've heard of it because, you know, we, I, gosh, we've only mentioned it on the

04:46.640 --> 04:48.840
show about 50 gazillion times.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.840
That's okay.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.420
Cause it's, it's a charity thing and we'll say it a gazillion more times for charity.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.420
What is, what is up?

04:54.420 --> 04:56.360
What's, what's the, what's the big event that you are co-hosting?

04:56.360 --> 05:00.700
Oom loud, a rock band night for child's play charity.

05:00.700 --> 05:05.640
It's a performance based rock band night.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.280
And I really stress it as performance.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.140
It's not a competition.

05:09.140 --> 05:13.080
We don't give a care about your score whatsoever.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.320
It's all about rocking out for child's play charity.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.320
Yeah.

05:17.320 --> 05:22.800
No one, no one, as the old saying on the internet goes, no one Kerr, if you have a crappy score

05:22.800 --> 05:27.320
on a song or what have you, you're going to get the most props if you have like, if you're

05:27.320 --> 05:29.840
really into it, like the outfits and stuff.

05:29.840 --> 05:35.200
Some of the stuff I saw last year, outstanding, the Lego rock band people were great.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.160
There was a lots of dress ups, bands, good times.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
Yeah.

05:40.160 --> 05:51.600
Well, we started it last year under the wake of Fundrauser, which went away, but it was

05:51.600 --> 05:59.680
Chris Koehler of wired.com game life blog Joe Marquette of Game Helper and myself.

05:59.680 --> 06:05.920
And we put on San Francisco's child's play charity event community fundraiser for child's

06:05.920 --> 06:07.520
play.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.800
And last year we did it all soup to nuts within eight weeks.

06:11.800 --> 06:18.120
And that's also incorporated as our own nonprofit to be all nice and legal.

06:18.120 --> 06:22.960
And I guess I should talk about the band packages because that's really where we're leading

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
into.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Sure.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
Why not?

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
We're all over the map, but that's okay.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
We're everywhere.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
That's why it's a three hour show.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.200
We can never stay on one track.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.200
So it's fine.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.200
Take all the time you need.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.880
So it's not, we don't do the just go up and play at a bar.

06:36.880 --> 06:42.920
Like if you go to a bar or anything to play rock band, it's usually one screen and everyone

06:42.920 --> 06:45.560
is looking at the screen.

06:45.560 --> 06:51.360
What we do is have the performers turn around and face the audience and perform out to the

06:51.360 --> 06:52.360
audience.

06:52.360 --> 06:57.040
And there's monitors on the stage floor, but they look like speaker monitors to the audience

06:57.040 --> 06:59.620
because it's next to the speaker monitors.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.840
And we don't just let anyone just walk up and play.

07:02.840 --> 07:14.280
We pre-order band packages where a group of friends make a donation to UMLoud on our website

07:14.280 --> 07:16.240
to purchase a band package.

07:16.240 --> 07:21.560
And then they have one song that they pick that no one else will play on their main stage.

07:21.560 --> 07:26.600
So like if I claim a song and I say like Gaga is mine tonight, it's me.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
I am Gaga.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.080
Then nobody else can pick that same Gaga song.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.400
First come first serve.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.680
But yes, once it's locked in, it's yours.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.360
No one else will play on the main stage.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.040
Because that really sucks at like karaoke sometimes and you got like four people in

07:41.040 --> 07:46.240
a row, you know, because we belong together now.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.040
It's like, oh God, shut up.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.040
And also-

07:49.040 --> 07:50.040
They all get progressively worse.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.660
Well, it's also, you know, there are 2000 songs in rock band.

07:53.660 --> 07:55.120
It's going to be hard to duplicate.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.600
Is that even counting the network stuff?

07:57.600 --> 08:00.640
I think their 2000 count counts the network stuff.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.640
Okay.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.880
But still, that's a lot.

08:03.880 --> 08:08.360
But the thing is, is that we don't know what's going to happen with these bands when they

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
show, especially last year.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.920
We didn't know if people were going to get it.

08:10.920 --> 08:15.160
I mean, we didn't know if people were just going to like, oh, I'm playing rock band or

08:15.160 --> 08:19.680
like, no, this is my rock concert.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.960
And there were people that got it.

08:23.960 --> 08:31.760
The one band that to me really got it was Ironhead, as in the Brutal Legend game.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.760
Yes, I remember that.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.400
And pictures of that girl all over the internet.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
I should plug the website.

08:36.400 --> 08:45.000
If you go to umloud.org, now that's U-M-L-O-U-D, umloud.org, and you'll see the little flicker

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
button there too, and that will give you all the pictures.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.880
And you'll see Ophelia there.

08:52.880 --> 09:00.520
She's pretty hard to miss because she spent a couple of hours before that day being dressed

09:00.520 --> 09:03.960
up in blue makeup, head to toe.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.080
And I didn't know that they, I mean, I knew they were named Ironhead, knew they were doing

09:07.080 --> 09:13.600
... I'm totally blanking on the song name.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.240
Whatever song they did, yeah.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.920
Helion Electric Eye.

09:16.920 --> 09:22.160
And when they hit the stage, I saw her there dressed up and like, oh, that's one of my

09:22.160 --> 09:23.600
friends.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.680
And then when they performed, it was absolutely amazing.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.120
They got it.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.720
And this year we hope to have more that get it.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.140
The ante is being upped now that people are seeing the pictures from last year.

09:39.140 --> 09:42.320
It's like, how can we just even take it a step further?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.560
You know, there's going to be people that are like, we can outdo.

09:44.560 --> 09:51.320
And we want to facilitate that at UMLoud, which is why we're doing something additional

09:51.320 --> 09:52.320
to the event.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.560
Now, the ultimate band package, that's the band package that we did last year, and then

09:56.560 --> 10:01.320
we're still doing, those go on sale November 1st.

10:01.320 --> 10:07.760
But we decided we wanted to do one really special package that we're calling the Headliner

10:07.760 --> 10:09.080
Band.

10:09.080 --> 10:14.560
And this package is, there's only one of them, because it's the headliner.

10:14.560 --> 10:20.400
So it's auctioned off, and it's actually going on right now through eBay.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.320
And they get a two song set.

10:23.320 --> 10:27.840
And as long as they don't dilly dally, they get first choice for the night to reserve

10:27.840 --> 10:29.980
those two songs.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.120
And they're the headliners.

10:31.120 --> 10:36.920
So obviously they're on the flyers, they're on the posters, they're on the video that

10:36.920 --> 10:37.920
we make.

10:37.920 --> 10:44.520
We actually have Area 5, which is a video production company that will be making the

10:44.520 --> 10:51.600
commercials and, assuming schedules gel well, will be doing the video for us with the Headliner

10:51.600 --> 10:52.720
Band.

10:52.720 --> 10:58.640
And you get your own place at DNA Lounge, which is the venue that we're in, with drink

10:58.640 --> 11:00.680
and food service all provided to you.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.360
So you can have people feed you grapes?

11:02.360 --> 11:03.360
Yes.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.360
All right, awesome.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.960
I'm liking this so far.

11:08.960 --> 11:15.520
And that's going on now, and that auction actually ends Thursday at 4pm-ish.

11:15.520 --> 11:23.140
And we really hope we get a lot of people bidding on that thing, because the donation

11:23.140 --> 11:24.800
all goes to Child's Play.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.440
I was going to stress, this money is not going to SEG.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
No.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.420
This money is not going to DNA Lounge.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.640
This money is going to charity.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.640
All of it, right?

11:33.640 --> 11:34.640
Yes.

11:34.640 --> 11:39.000
It's going to Child's Play charity, which provides video games, toys, and other financial

11:39.000 --> 11:42.320
support to children's hospitals around the globe.

11:42.320 --> 11:48.400
And it's kind of known as the Penny Arcade charity, but even Penny Arcade wants to stress

11:48.400 --> 11:52.920
that it's not like, oh, this is directly all Penny Arcade.

11:52.920 --> 12:01.240
They want to stress that this is, yes, they house the offices and the staff for it, but...

12:01.240 --> 12:03.920
They planted the seed, but it's grown into its own thing.

12:03.920 --> 12:09.280
And especially with all of the community fundraisers that happen, like Goomlap, but also Desert

12:09.280 --> 12:13.600
Bus for Hope, and the Mario Marathon, and all the others.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.480
These are people, Child's Play itself just is the direct servicer.

12:18.480 --> 12:27.160
They take the money and directly deal with the child's life services, or equivalent of

12:27.160 --> 12:29.120
the children's hospitals and their network.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.160
And they get the toys there.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.920
They make what toys are needed and all that.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.000
So what's given is exactly what the hospital needs.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.940
And what the community fundraisers do is help in very creative, unique ways to raise money

12:46.940 --> 12:47.940
for this charity.

12:47.940 --> 12:55.120
And it's actually the envy of nonprofits because every year for Child's Play has beaten its

12:55.120 --> 13:00.920
high score the previous year, including the past two years when that shouldn't have happened,

13:00.920 --> 13:04.720
economic downturn.

13:04.720 --> 13:12.560
And Child's Play was one of the very, very few charities that increased their giving.

13:12.560 --> 13:18.040
And that's everything to do with these community fundraisers across the globe.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.400
Do you guys have a fundraising goal set for Goomlap this year?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.880
Is that one of those, you know, I don't want to talk about it type of things?

13:22.880 --> 13:25.940
Well, it kind of is.

13:25.940 --> 13:27.720
We always want to do more.

13:27.720 --> 13:39.680
And we just focus that energy on making the best event without making much cost on how

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
to put on the event.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.680
Okay.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.060
And we have a lot of partners that help us.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.060
Let me ask this.

13:44.060 --> 13:45.400
Can I ask how much we raised last year?

13:45.400 --> 13:51.440
Last year, I wrote the checkout and mailed it in for $7,000 to Child's Play.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.440
Nice.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.440
Very nice.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.800
And, you know, that was eight weeks of putting everything together.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.440
It was kind of last moment.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.760
So this year, we hope to improve on the situation.

14:02.760 --> 14:03.760
And also a lot...

14:03.760 --> 14:04.760
Umlaut is...

14:04.760 --> 14:08.080
Just for the record, I would have never known that it only took eight weeks to do if you

14:08.080 --> 14:09.080
hadn't told me.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.080
Yeah.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.080
You guys did a really good job last year.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.080
I know.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.680
I don't even know how we did it.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.520
And I'm not just saying that because you're a friend.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.960
You really was a smooth operation.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.200
But, you know, we also have good partners.

14:21.200 --> 14:27.840
DNA Lounge, Jamie Zawinski, the owner, and Barry, and all of them over there are just

14:27.840 --> 14:31.360
absolutely wonderful to us.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.500
You know, we definitely make sure they're in the loop.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.920
We definitely respect them as the venue.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.920
And they...

14:37.920 --> 14:38.920
Harmonics isn't on this too, right?

14:38.920 --> 14:39.920
Oh, yeah.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.920
Yeah.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.920
And harmonics.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.920
Oh, I should say.

14:42.920 --> 14:49.840
We will have every song playable in Rock Band 3 as in...

14:49.840 --> 14:52.480
Harmonics has a magic box that has them all, right?

14:52.480 --> 14:53.480
Yeah.

14:53.480 --> 14:57.120
They have the magic boxes of dev kits that they will...

14:57.120 --> 14:58.120
And they fly people out.

14:58.120 --> 15:03.260
John Drake and crew will fly out for our event with the dev kits.

15:03.260 --> 15:04.400
And we actually have two stages.

15:04.400 --> 15:09.460
So I know I've been stressing the main stage and the performances there, which is the show

15:09.460 --> 15:10.460
in itself.

15:10.460 --> 15:14.040
But there's a lot of other things that we have there.

15:14.040 --> 15:19.840
We have in the lounge room, the second room, free play Rock Band, show up.

15:19.840 --> 15:25.320
We have the donation bin out there to kind of guilt you, but it's free play.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.800
We don't care to walk up.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.240
You know, that's your traditional sort of like bar Rock Band setting.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.280
And that's free play.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.880
Last year was like the Beatles room because that was the big game last year.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.640
And this year is just kind of whatever is clever.

15:36.640 --> 15:41.640
Well, we don't know what we're gonna have special yet for...

15:41.640 --> 15:45.560
We don't know what we have special yet for this year.

15:45.560 --> 15:51.600
But last year we debuted before it came out, the Rubber Soul album from Beatles Rock Band,

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
which was...

15:52.600 --> 15:54.320
Which is the best and is sitting in my closet right there.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.920
It's somewhere in there.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.640
Well, am I gonna get Jamie to go with me this year?

15:58.640 --> 16:01.020
Maybe she can belt out a tune or two.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.020
Maybe.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.020
On the Beast, I will make you go on the main stage.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.020
Actually, let me ask this.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.860
I'm sorry to take this wheel in another direction, but this question has been kind of like lingering

16:06.860 --> 16:08.160
on my mind.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.200
Maybe I'm not a person that wants to get up in front of the crowd.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.200
You know what?

16:12.200 --> 16:13.200
I don't...

16:13.200 --> 16:14.900
I want to help the charity, but I don't...

16:14.900 --> 16:15.900
I don't...

16:15.900 --> 16:18.500
Singing in front of people is not my thing.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.520
What fun things can I expect to have at UMLoud?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.800
Well, first of all, it's the performances.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.760
As I said, they are performances.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.520
And if you search YouTube for UMLoud, you'll see what I mean.

16:29.520 --> 16:36.920
I mean, yes, the cell phone cameras, but you'll see the kind of performances.

16:36.920 --> 16:46.880
And that alone is worth the $10 door, but we don't stop there.

16:46.880 --> 16:54.120
We will have what's been called the nerd yard sale.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.440
And we get...

16:56.440 --> 17:04.380
We clean out the closets of various game studios and developers and publishers and news outlets

17:04.380 --> 17:08.760
and all that to clean out all the swag they've collected for the year and just put it on

17:08.760 --> 17:09.760
the table.

17:09.760 --> 17:15.120
And if you pay for the door, you pick one thing from the table.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.480
So you at least walk out with something.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.440
But in addition, we're going to have a raffle and some pretty good prizes, if I do say so

17:23.440 --> 17:25.120
myself.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.240
We'll be announcing those.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.360
A lot of...

17:27.360 --> 17:31.640
Right now, our attention is all on the bands because we're trying to get this auction that

17:31.640 --> 17:38.080
finished on... it ends Thursday, and then the following Monday is when we get the ultimate

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
band.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.560
So we're kind of geared towards that, and then we make the push of, please show up.

17:43.560 --> 17:48.240
Well, I wanted you to get that out there, that there was that going on, because we do...

17:48.240 --> 17:52.520
Believe it or not, there are a few friends of our show that work at various developers

17:52.520 --> 17:56.040
and things, and even though I know they don't email us or talk to us all the time because

17:56.040 --> 18:00.680
they don't want to talk about their projects, if you happen to work for a developer or some

18:00.680 --> 18:06.560
type of game studio and you have some extra stuff sitting in a storage room that maybe

18:06.560 --> 18:12.880
some fans might want, Umlaut would be a great charity to kind of give those to, right?

18:12.880 --> 18:13.880
Yes.

18:13.880 --> 18:20.440
We actually are looking for sponsors, both financial as well as gifts and all that.

18:20.440 --> 18:29.200
We are our own non-profit, so we are our own 501c3 in case people are a little weary of

18:29.200 --> 18:30.800
not giving directly to Child's Play.

18:30.800 --> 18:38.280
First of all, yes, it's going to Child's Play, and donating to us directly is also legal

18:38.280 --> 18:42.000
in the state of California and the United States as a non-profit.

18:42.000 --> 18:51.000
So please, if you want to give us stuff or be a financial partner with us, please, please,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.840
please go to umlaut.org.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.640
There's that sponsor link there, and we would love to talk to you.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.400
I could probably look through the vault and find you swag.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
That'd be awesome.

19:01.400 --> 19:07.600
I've got like a dozen left of those Metal Gear Solid behind the scenes things.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.440
So if they're just collecting dust here, absolutely, it'd be great charity for OLR to pitch in

19:12.440 --> 19:13.440
and help out.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.440
So, excellent.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.640
Maybe I have a few more Capcom pillowcases.

19:16.640 --> 19:22.120
Well, I'm trying to think what else to kind of get out here before we move on with the

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
show.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.120
I'll ask you more maybe later on in the show, part B, kind of about what goes into the actual

19:26.120 --> 19:30.840
planning of the event, but as far as the event itself, anything else we need to know about

19:30.840 --> 19:32.760
what's coming up December 9th?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.440
It's Thursday, December 9th.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.920
I stress the Thursday because last year was on Wednesday.

19:36.920 --> 19:44.560
We leveled up to Thursday, and if we get more people, we may be able to level up for weekend.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.440
So it's really important for people to show up.

19:48.440 --> 19:54.000
So if you're anywhere remotely near the Bay Area, please come on down.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.720
And tickets, if tickets are on sale right now, you can click on tickets on the website

19:59.720 --> 20:04.040
if you know you're not going to be in a band, but do want to show up, that's really helpful

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
for us.

20:05.040 --> 20:09.800
I should also note that if you are in a band package, you're on the guest list, you get

20:09.800 --> 20:13.120
in, you're good.

20:13.120 --> 20:18.280
But if you have any inkling of showing up, please show up.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.240
You will not regret it.

20:21.240 --> 20:25.080
And for those of our listeners, because we are, believe it or not, an international show,

20:25.080 --> 20:30.480
we have folks that listen to the show in Mexico, in Sweden, and all these places, as much as

20:30.480 --> 20:33.680
we really want them to come, they're probably not going to be able to swing it, but there

20:33.680 --> 20:36.600
are ways they can still participate if they're very far away, right?

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
Yes.

20:37.600 --> 20:41.720
We have the donation button right on every single page at nlal.org.

20:41.720 --> 20:47.600
Which is if you, Child's Play uses PayPal for direct donations.

20:47.600 --> 20:52.720
We use Google Checkout, and we don't want, I want to stress that we're not trying to

20:52.720 --> 20:57.160
like take money, or to have this like bidding war between who donates to Child's Play and

20:57.160 --> 21:01.320
who donates to UMLoud because it's going the same place anyways, but you know, if you feel

21:01.320 --> 21:05.000
more comfortable with Google Checkout, the donation button's there for you.

21:05.000 --> 21:12.120
If you want to go straight to Child's Play, awesome, it's childsplaycharity.org, and that

21:12.120 --> 21:15.240
just goes such a long way.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.360
Absolutely.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.120
And I have a good feeling you're going to beat that $7,000 this year, I have a really

21:20.120 --> 21:21.120
good feeling.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.120
I sure bloody hope so.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.120
All right.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.880
Well, best of luck, Seg, and of course you're going to be sitting in on the show tonight,

21:26.880 --> 21:29.600
so feel free to chime in on anything gaming related and so forth.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
Oh, I'll have opinions.

21:30.600 --> 21:35.480
Oh, I bet you will, especially, there might be stories about a particular developer that

21:35.480 --> 21:36.480
might be of...

21:36.480 --> 21:37.480
Oh yeah, that.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.360
Yes, of interest to you, but we'll see.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.400
All right, moving on, we are in, yes, start talking.

21:42.400 --> 21:48.480
I'm telling the chat room that if I can get $150 in donations tonight, I'll sing.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.480
Oh, really?

21:50.480 --> 21:53.560
The proverbial gauntlet has been thrown down.

21:53.560 --> 21:59.680
If you guys can scrounge up $150 in donations to UMLoud, then Dark Soccer, you are saying

21:59.680 --> 22:02.760
you will get up on that stage and you will sing?

22:02.760 --> 22:04.760
Yes.

22:04.760 --> 22:09.560
I can't put into words what a big freaking deal that is.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.960
I just want to put out there.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.840
Because everybody but me thinks I can sing.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.920
Dark Soccer is actually a pretty good singer.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.280
Can we extend that maybe through the next week for our podcastees who maybe aren't listening

22:19.280 --> 22:20.280
live tonight?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.720
If we get $150 tonight, I'll sing.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.720
Oh, okay, you're throwing down.

22:24.720 --> 22:29.720
If we don't get $150 tonight, if we get $250 by next weekend...

22:29.720 --> 22:31.800
She's throwing all these random numbers out there.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.080
No, seriously, because there's a method of my madness.

22:34.080 --> 22:39.960
If we don't hit $150 tonight, and they have a way of saying donate in the name of...

22:39.960 --> 22:48.640
But if they go through the UMLoud donation button, I have obviously no access to the

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
Child's Play 1.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.640
Yeah.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.640
But...

22:51.640 --> 22:52.640
Yeah.

22:52.640 --> 23:03.680
There should be some sort of note, I think.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.600
We'll figure out the logistics.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.400
If you do donate...

23:09.400 --> 23:16.200
If there isn't some place to put it in, obviously, can people email...

23:16.200 --> 23:19.560
Let's have them email the receipt number.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.160
Email your receipt to Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
Perfect.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.160
That works.

23:24.160 --> 23:28.280
But if you can't put it on there, make sure you say, For Orange Lounge Radio.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.280
All right.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.280
Or something about...

23:30.280 --> 23:37.920
And if you happen to buy a million copies of Eye of Judgment tonight, how about if we

23:37.920 --> 23:38.920
can...

23:38.920 --> 23:42.040
How much money can we raise to get Loki to go to the show in a tingle outfit?

23:42.040 --> 23:43.040
No.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.240
How about if we can raise $1,000 by the night of the...

23:46.240 --> 23:47.760
No, I am not going.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.760
We gotta watch it.

23:48.760 --> 23:53.880
Okay, if we can raise $1,000, but then I'll dress as freaking tingle shit.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.400
Uh-oh.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
She said it.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.400
She said it.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
All right.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
Okay, okay.

24:00.400 --> 24:08.600
If we can raise $1,000 by the night of UMLoud, I will go as a Para Para girl.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.200
Blonde wig and all.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.200
All right.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
Well, regardless of how much...

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
I'll wear some costume.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.400
Regardless of how much is raised tonight or until the night, you're at least gonna go

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
to the show, I hope.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
Yeah.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.400
Absolutely.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
All right, good.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
Yay.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.400
Oh, she went to school that night.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
Cut class.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
All right.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.400
I think about it.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.400
All right.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.400
Tell the teacher it's for charity.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
All right.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
Anyhow.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
Let's move on.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
Talk about our gaming weeks.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.480
We're gonna talk a little bit about what types of video games we have been playing this week.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.240
Usually it's how we start off the show, but you know what?

24:37.240 --> 24:38.720
We have charity things to talk about tonight.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.520
So we're gonna start now with how was your gaming week?

24:41.520 --> 24:43.960
Dark Soccer, what kind of video games you've been playing this week?

24:43.960 --> 24:47.480
Well, I just played something that I'm gonna be talking about later on in the show, so

24:47.480 --> 24:49.480
I won't talk about it right now.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.720
What else did I play?

24:52.720 --> 24:56.680
Bayonetta, because she is a sexy bitch.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.840
And what else did I play?

24:58.840 --> 25:01.680
I played some Final Fantasy 13.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.760
I tried to play some Star Trek Online, but I'm pissed off at the Borg right now.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.160
Very, very pissed.

25:06.160 --> 25:11.560
Okay, if somebody knows how to pass a stupid Borg mission, let me know, because I am pissed

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
off at it.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.720
It just says, Defeat Borg, steal data.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.720
Can I tell a quick side story?

25:15.720 --> 25:16.920
There's 50 of them in there.

25:16.920 --> 25:17.920
It's a viniculum.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.920
What?

25:18.920 --> 25:21.040
Can I tell a quick side story that made me think of you today?

25:21.040 --> 25:25.520
I was playing WoW this morning, and I was in a party for the holiday event with a Boomkin

25:25.520 --> 25:28.160
whose name was Tom Paris.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.160
And we did a very...

25:29.160 --> 25:32.040
The tank disconnected because of this bug going on in WoW right now.

25:32.040 --> 25:37.720
So the Moonkin had to tank the boss, which is kind of funny if you know how WoW works.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.440
So I said at the end of the fight, I said, Janeway would be very proud of you, Tom Paris.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.680
And he said, Oh, that's my rogue.

25:43.680 --> 25:47.140
Ah, that's great.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.380
So it made me think of you, because it's all Star Trek nerds.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.380
That's great.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.380
Why isn't he playing Star Trek Online?

25:51.380 --> 25:52.380
He probably is.

25:52.380 --> 25:56.520
He must be on a Mac.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.560
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.080
I have several friends who actually can't play Star Trek Online anymore because they

26:02.080 --> 26:05.760
don't have it for Mac.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.760
Hurry up!

26:06.760 --> 26:07.760
Get it out!

26:07.760 --> 26:09.760
Um, oh yeah.

26:09.760 --> 26:15.240
And I also played a lot of Plants vs. Zombies, and because I'm addicted, addicted, addicted

26:15.240 --> 26:26.000
to jackpot mode in Plants vs. Zombies and zombie bowling.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.160
And um, I played a bunch of other stuff too.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.600
Oh, I've given up on Arbacular Drop.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.060
I'm done with it.

26:33.060 --> 26:34.060
Given up.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.960
Oh, and I played some Portal.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.520
You just decided to move on to Portal.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.520
Yeah.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.640
Well, I mean, Portal is more polished, you know?

26:42.640 --> 26:45.080
And Arbacular Drop is a great concept.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.920
And Portal is just the better execution.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.480
Alright.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.140
I smell baked goods.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.240
Anything else for your gaming week, Dar Sakura?

26:53.240 --> 26:54.240
Meh.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.200
Alright, let's move on to Loki.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.340
How was your gaming week, Loki?

26:57.340 --> 26:59.160
I didn't play a whole lot of stuff.

26:59.160 --> 27:06.120
I played, um, I think some Plants vs. Zombies.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.080
I haven't really been playing that much this week.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.920
No, the only iOS game I think I've really been playing a lot of recently is-

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
Do I have a unicorn attack?

27:12.920 --> 27:14.680
Uh, no, actually not that.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.640
I did play some last week though on the show of that.

27:17.640 --> 27:22.040
No, I've been actually addicted to Cartoon Wars 2.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.040
It's a tower defense game.

27:24.040 --> 27:27.920
And with stick figures, except they have, like, heavy artillery and stuff.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.920
It's pretty awesome.

27:28.920 --> 27:33.640
They have everything from, like, you know, medieval weapons, swords, spears, bow and

27:33.640 --> 27:38.760
arrows and stuff to giant mechs and bazookas and all that fun stuff.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.240
So it's pretty fun.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.000
I'm just grinding along right now.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.400
And then, um, you know, I played a little bit of DJ Hero 2.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.060
And I'm totally digging the new songs in there.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.120
Although they're still just, like, the first game, but I mean, I guess it's gonna be with

27:54.120 --> 27:55.120
every game that comes out.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.400
There's a bunch of songs that I don't really care for.

27:57.400 --> 28:02.560
Like, I really wish they would stop putting all these, like, old school, um, like, seriously,

28:02.560 --> 28:06.760
we do not need any more Jackson 5 music in the goddamn DJ Hero series.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.320
No more Jackson 5 at all.

28:10.320 --> 28:19.000
And some of, like, the old 90s rap stuff that's in there, um, is alright, but I don't know.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.440
I just think they need more variety in some of the songs, because I can only hear so many

28:23.440 --> 28:29.800
remixes of California, you know, before I just get sick of it.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.800
Um, or OPP.

28:31.800 --> 28:39.220
Yeah, it's too bad you can't get, uh, your, like, the booty mashups or that kind of level

28:39.220 --> 28:42.960
because, you know, they have to, like, actually get the licensing for the music.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.160
More gorillas!

28:44.160 --> 28:45.160
More gorillas!

28:45.160 --> 28:49.320
Yeah, they have the Stylo, um, mix with itself, yeah.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.080
I need, I need to hear that one.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.080
I love Stylo.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
I love the whole album.

28:53.080 --> 28:57.880
It is a lot harder than the first game, which is something that's, uh, worth noting.

28:57.880 --> 29:02.440
Like, I, I mainly just play in medium, but just because I haven't played enough DJ Hero

29:02.440 --> 29:07.760
of the War, I was, I think at one point, starting to go on hard and stuff, um, to get to expert

29:07.760 --> 29:12.840
and all that fun stuff, but I like kinda just playing it more relaxed instead of just trying

29:12.840 --> 29:18.520
to mash buttons like crazy in it, and even on medium, it's mashing buttons like crazy

29:18.520 --> 29:26.200
with a lot of the songs, like the Firestarter remix with itself, um, it was just insanely,

29:26.200 --> 29:30.120
it was more difficult than I had anticipated, you know, for a song like that, you know,

29:30.120 --> 29:31.400
one of the first songs that's in the game.

29:31.400 --> 29:36.640
Oh, hey, it's really hard, but, uh, yeah, I'm digging it.

29:36.640 --> 29:42.800
I like the, the, um, setup in the game, and the best part, of course, is playing as your

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
avatar.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.760
So, you can DJ your own game.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.760
I have it on PlayStation, so.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.760
Well, that's why you chose Badda-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.760
Exactly.

29:50.760 --> 29:51.760
Oh, no.

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
You've got the soundboard.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.800
I'm sorry, I didn't load the soundboard before.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.760
Now, do they have it where you can play as your home character, because, you know, Sony's

29:59.760 --> 30:02.320
really innovative with all their home features, right?

30:02.320 --> 30:05.240
Are you really asking that?

30:05.240 --> 30:06.240
Like really?

30:06.240 --> 30:07.240
Oh, Sony.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.240
I want to play it with my own me.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.240
You know what?

30:10.240 --> 30:12.240
Let me, let me answer that with a sound.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.440
Delayed radio, boys and girls, thank you.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.640
I used the toilet today during the other podcast.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.160
During that other show?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.680
Which I have to say something about soon.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.680
All right, we'll get to it.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.680
We'll get to it during housekeeping.

30:24.680 --> 30:28.680
We're hopefully going to have, we're hopefully going to have some DJ Hero music during the

30:28.680 --> 30:36.000
break, although smart me forgot to bring my stupid, uh, VGA cable for my 360.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.120
So I'm trying this really, you know, um, I guess MacGyver way of getting it to work by

30:42.120 --> 30:45.760
hooking up my video capture card through my PC.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.960
But uh, it doesn't like the fact that it's on two different networks, so I have to plug

30:49.960 --> 30:51.520
it into the router.

30:51.520 --> 30:56.560
But the router's cords are so short that I can't pull it out.

30:56.560 --> 30:57.880
And Grand Theft Auto, that's what I played this week.

30:57.880 --> 31:00.000
You can't pull it out?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Can't pull the router out.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Oh.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.440
I don't want us to just start disconnecting random cords cause as if the storms weren't

31:06.440 --> 31:07.760
causing enough problems with internet out.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.520
Just last thing we need is Loki.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.760
I think doing stuff.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.480
I think I can pull the gray cord.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.480
All right.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.680
Cut the red wire.

31:15.680 --> 31:20.440
We're running long tonight anyway, so if you can't do the music, it's all right.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.440
Oh, okay.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.200
I'll just take a look at it.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
All right.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.200
Anyhow, let's free cookies.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.200
Yes.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.200
Cookies.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.200
We'll make it all better.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.200
All right.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.200
Uh, Seg, how was your gaming week?

31:31.200 --> 31:34.360
So I've been so busy, but I know you were going to ask me this question, so I really

31:34.360 --> 31:37.600
made it a point to actually play games.

31:37.600 --> 31:48.520
And I've been playing Costume Quest, which just came out on Xbox and PlayStation 3's

31:48.520 --> 31:50.640
downloadable service.

31:50.640 --> 31:58.600
And this is Double Fine's first let's not make a game once every five years game.

31:58.600 --> 32:02.720
And it's really good.

32:02.720 --> 32:09.240
They set out to make a nice, I'll say light RPG.

32:09.240 --> 32:18.080
And the concept is you either play, I'll say the two main characters are twins, a guy and

32:18.080 --> 32:19.080
a girl.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.940
And there's literally the point in the intro cut scene where you pick which one you're

32:22.940 --> 32:26.160
going to, which gender you're going to be pretty much.

32:26.160 --> 32:31.880
And the one you didn't pick gets kidnapped by monsters who are trying to collect candy.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.600
But the adults think that they're just big kids dressed up so that you don't believe

32:35.600 --> 32:38.200
the kids that there are real monsters out there.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.200
It sounds like Saw for children.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.620
Well, the...

32:41.620 --> 32:42.760
Make your choice.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.440
And you're wearing costumes because it's Halloween.

32:45.440 --> 32:51.160
But when you go into battle mode, the costumes that are like, you know, cardboard and tape,

32:51.160 --> 32:55.480
they turn into those characters in battle mode.

32:55.480 --> 32:59.920
So there's a robot costume and then, you know, when they go into battle mode, they turn in

32:59.920 --> 33:05.800
basically your robot mech warrior type character.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.640
I'd totally be down for a G-rated Saw movie.

33:09.640 --> 33:10.640
What would be the point?

33:10.640 --> 33:13.480
It would be funny.

33:13.480 --> 33:19.840
Anyhow, I've also been playing Game Dev Story on the iPhone because, you know, I can't get

33:19.840 --> 33:23.080
enough of game development.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.400
And it's a nice little game.

33:24.400 --> 33:32.320
It feels like it was a cell phone game, like your, you know, before the iPhone, you know,

33:32.320 --> 33:35.200
the days of before, before, before.

33:35.200 --> 33:44.560
But it's a really nice little game that I can play a little bit and put it to a side.

33:44.560 --> 33:56.200
And then I got something else as I pull out my Rock Band keyboard, and I've been playing

33:56.200 --> 34:05.600
Rock Band 3 over the weekend for research for Room Loud, because, you know, because...

34:05.600 --> 34:07.520
There's no fun to be had this weekend.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.520
Oh, no.

34:08.520 --> 34:15.040
Well, it really is because we really try to make the main stage as smooth as possible

34:15.040 --> 34:21.040
because the more time we dilly-dally, the less bands get on stage, and we can't stop

34:21.040 --> 34:24.320
the rock, cannot stop the rock.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.280
So are you going to have up to seven people?

34:26.280 --> 34:27.280
Because...

34:27.280 --> 34:28.280
Yeah.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.280
Awesome.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.320
You know, obviously, if it's a Rock Band 1 song, well, you know, it's a Rock Band 1 song.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.480
But if the song supports it, yeah.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.880
So for harmonies, though, we have all three mics, and they're actually plugged into the

34:39.880 --> 34:43.440
sound system before they're plugged into the game.

34:43.440 --> 34:48.040
So we just have the mics on all the time, and people can just do harmonies or whatever

34:48.040 --> 34:50.020
anyway.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.480
So even if you have, like, a Rock Band 1 song, if you want to have backup singers anyway,

34:53.480 --> 34:54.480
no harm, no foul.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.480
No harm, no foul.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
Yeah.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.240
And it's not about the score anyway.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
Exactly.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.880
So, awesome.

35:00.880 --> 35:05.040
It gives the sound engineer actual control with the voice, and then, you know, to make

35:05.040 --> 35:07.160
you sound good.

35:07.160 --> 35:10.080
So I know you haven't been able to spend a lot of quality time with Rock Band 3, but

35:10.080 --> 35:12.760
what do you think at first impressions, a worthy upgrade?

35:12.760 --> 35:20.040
It is definitely harmonics finally putting into practice the years of research and all

35:20.040 --> 35:21.040
the things they've learned.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.760
Not that they haven't, but it's just, they now, they got it.

35:24.760 --> 35:31.960
You know, like, then they're able to put it together, and it really shows.

35:31.960 --> 35:38.660
I like how career mode is sort of always on, in the sense that even when you're just doing

35:38.660 --> 35:41.080
quick play, it's still contributing to.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.080
That's so awesome.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.080
Thank you.

35:43.080 --> 35:50.280
Yeah, so there is career activities, like, very, you know, structured career activities

35:50.280 --> 35:57.800
of like, okay, here's two songs and a set of five go, and then, you know, an achievement

35:57.800 --> 35:58.800
is associated with that.

35:58.800 --> 36:05.440
But just in general and in broad is just play the game, and it's just always, it's ranking

36:05.440 --> 36:06.440
up.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.160
It's more of raking up the personal, your personal account.

36:09.160 --> 36:13.720
So it's really stressing more of bringing your profile, putting it on your USB stick

36:13.720 --> 36:19.240
when you go to your friends, and then you're raking up when you're at your friends' place

36:19.240 --> 36:20.240
and doing that profile.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.240
Oh, cool.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.240
Well, that sounds really interesting that they're doing that.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.240
Yeah.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.240
So you don't have to make all these separate bands anymore.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.240
That's kind of cool.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.240
Sounds very interesting.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.080
So, um, let me ask this real quick.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.040
What was the first song you had to play?

36:31.040 --> 36:34.120
What was the first song I should have recorded that?

36:34.120 --> 36:38.600
Ah, oh, I thought there might have been, no, I forgot.

36:38.600 --> 36:43.640
I started doing career path and I just, I'm totally blanking on it, but the first, uh,

36:43.640 --> 36:52.340
keyboard song, uh, Rock Lobster, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, which are the correct

36:52.340 --> 36:54.680
answer should have been Bohemian Rhapsody.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.520
Oh, I'm sorry, SAG.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
You lose.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
No, I'm saving.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.640
Ah, that button's never going to get old.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.640
That's my favorite button.

37:02.640 --> 37:07.240
But, uh, no, I'm saving that for when I, when I play with, uh, friends of mine.

37:07.240 --> 37:11.960
So get that you need a band for, cause it was just me playing alone.

37:11.960 --> 37:12.960
Fair counterpoint.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.960
All by myself.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.500
I saw the trailer for Pro Mode.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.120
That was pretty crazy with the new guitars.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.120
Yeah.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.120
Wow.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.120
Yeah.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
The, the, the pro guitars.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
Um, damn.

37:23.120 --> 37:27.240
And the, the MIDI Stratocaster that they're working on?

37:27.240 --> 37:32.480
Well, actually the, so the, the MIDI stuff like the, the Rock Band 3 keyboard itself

37:32.480 --> 37:33.680
is MIDI out ready.

37:33.680 --> 37:42.360
It has, it is a MIDI keyboard and, um, they, on November 28th, they'll have a breakout

37:42.360 --> 37:50.920
box, uh, for real professional MIDI instruments and just to plug it in directly into, uh,

37:50.920 --> 37:53.280
the console itself.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.480
I can't, I can't tell you how excited I am for Pro Mode keyboards.

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
Oh yeah.

37:57.480 --> 37:58.480
Oh yeah.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.160
And that's, that's, that's, that's beauty because you can do Pro Mode with the Rock

38:01.160 --> 38:02.160
Band.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.160
Yeah.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.160
Keyboard.

38:04.160 --> 38:10.560
I mean, the, the only thing that you out and out need new equipment for is guitar for Pro

38:10.560 --> 38:12.200
in regards to Pro Mode.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.520
Drums, you do need the add on the, for the extra simples.

38:15.520 --> 38:19.040
You're talking about the new ones cause the old ones kind of suck.

38:19.040 --> 38:23.560
Well they're not doing a new, new Rock Band drum set.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.080
They fixed the cymbals a bit.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.080
They made it more sensitive.

38:26.080 --> 38:31.760
But the cymbals, the add on pack is new, but they're not, there's no Rock Band 3 drum base,

38:31.760 --> 38:33.320
you know, the, the base of the drum kit.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.840
There's no new Rock Band 3 one.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.480
It's just, they're now packaging it with the new, uh, cymbals.

38:38.480 --> 38:42.400
They don't have Pro Mode for singing in there.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
No.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.920
Well, what, what is Pro Mode?

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
Well, you get harmonies.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
Pro Mode's Oom-Loud.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.360
Ah, nice.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.360
Like that.

38:50.360 --> 38:54.600
And honestly, if you go into whatever the hard mode is, it's pretty hard.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
Yeah.

38:55.600 --> 39:01.080
On Beatles Rock Band, I mean, these are songs that I grew up with that I wasn't hitting

39:01.080 --> 39:02.080
perfectly.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.080
So.

39:03.080 --> 39:08.760
It, it, I also do want, you know, John Drake will, will thank me for this, you know, Pro

39:08.760 --> 39:16.120
Mode is great when you want to go to Pro Mode, but don't feel that you're losing the essence

39:16.120 --> 39:19.760
of Rock Band if that, that just doesn't attract you.

39:19.760 --> 39:25.720
Um, I've actually, we're actually discussing taking a guitar, Pro Guitar off the table

39:25.720 --> 39:29.000
for Oom-Loud just because it's too new.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.240
It's an instrument switch and we want to focus on performance, you know, people performing

39:35.240 --> 39:37.200
and not just going on this technical prowess.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.760
I think you, you would be fair to say, you know what, it's too much of a pain in the

39:40.760 --> 39:42.720
butt to swap out the guitars every time.

39:42.720 --> 39:46.240
Now all you have to say is those guitars are too damn expensive.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.240
Done.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.240
Sorry.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.240
Uh-uh.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.200
We sold the guitar and gave the money to kids.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
Deal.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.200
All right.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.200
All right.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.240
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us?

39:58.240 --> 40:03.000
Um, a little bit of a Scott Pilgrim, trying to finish that out, but then Costume Quest

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
came out.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
So there's that.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
All right.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.280
Since I, I'm going to get crap from Bobby Blackwell if I don't try to try to get you

40:09.280 --> 40:14.040
free info on this at some point, because since you haven't brought it up, your day job, you

40:14.040 --> 40:20.120
do work for a certain developer out there that makes a lot of amazing adventure games.

40:20.120 --> 40:25.080
Um, is Back to the Future as awesome as it sounds?

40:25.080 --> 40:28.120
Oh, it sounds awesome.

40:28.120 --> 40:34.280
Because if you go to TelltaleGames.com and go to the blog tab, you'll, it's on game trailers,

40:34.280 --> 40:46.080
but we just, or Telltale just posted the quick little interview with the voice of Marty McFly,

40:46.080 --> 40:52.560
who, it isn't Michael J. Fox, though, he, he did give likeness rights and all that.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.960
And I'm trying to...

40:54.960 --> 40:57.040
He sounds very close to Michael J. Fox.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.320
Yeah, and let's not forget Michael J. Fox is about twice as old as he was when the movie

41:00.320 --> 41:01.920
first came out, so, you know.

41:01.920 --> 41:06.200
And I, I still have to say, he didn't give his likeness rights for the pinball table,

41:06.200 --> 41:09.000
so this is kind of big.

41:09.000 --> 41:15.720
Um, AJ LaRosso, I'm, I'm probably mispronouncing his last name and I apologize, but all I'm

41:15.720 --> 41:23.120
just going to say, go to the video and, and, and, and you'll, you'll hear how good it sounds.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.600
Now did you get Biff?

41:24.600 --> 41:33.320
Uh, I, you know, AJ is doing a great job with sticking on target, um, uh, we do also have

41:33.320 --> 41:37.280
Christopher Lloyd as, as doc, he's voicing and everything.

41:37.280 --> 41:40.560
You need to seriously get him to say every word in the dictionary because that guy is

41:40.560 --> 41:41.560
not getting it.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
Get him while he can.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.320
Yeah, get the phenom table on him, yeah.

41:44.320 --> 41:48.720
All right, I'm not going to pry too much on the day job because I respect that, you know,

41:48.720 --> 41:51.160
you're a friend and we don't want to see you get fired for saying too much on the show.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.160
Well, talk about my game, like, puzzle issue.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.160
Let's talk about what's out.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.160
Puzzle agent.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.160
Yes.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
Puzzle agent.

41:59.160 --> 42:05.840
Uh, which is actually, um, uh, art style of Graham Annabelle, um, who, uh, does the dank

42:05.840 --> 42:11.160
or dunk depending on what mood he's in, uh, comics on the telltalegames.com website and

42:11.160 --> 42:17.820
also has a lot of, uh, video shorts and we made a game with really his art style, but

42:17.820 --> 42:25.240
new characters of Nelson Tethers, puzzle agent, the single agent of the FBI department of

42:25.240 --> 42:26.400
puzzle research.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.400
Cool.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.080
Uh, they have that.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
They do now.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
They do now.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.600
Uh, and, uh, it, it was, it was a great game to work on.

42:36.600 --> 42:43.120
Uh, it, it was the, the first full-time content programming title that I worked on, um, at

42:43.120 --> 42:46.800
Telltale and it's just, it was really fun working with it.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.600
It was, I also did some puzzle design.

42:48.600 --> 42:54.680
Mine's the second puzzle you show up, a few spruced around in there and the last puzzle.

42:54.680 --> 43:01.880
So, uh, I, I won't give away what they are because you should play them, but, uh, no,

43:01.880 --> 43:09.520
it's, it's, it's a, it's, it's a puzzle game with a plot and we try to do, made the, make

43:09.520 --> 43:13.760
the puzzles, at least the, the critical path ones, uh, relevant to the plot enough.

43:13.760 --> 43:18.840
Uh, you know, obviously there's a suspension of disbelief, but try to not do something

43:18.840 --> 43:23.080
like, I, I can tell you this key important thing you need to know about the plot, but

43:23.080 --> 43:25.200
first, here's a puzzle of matchsticks.

43:25.200 --> 43:33.640
Uh, but, um, uh, apparently we're having just, we're having drama.

43:33.640 --> 43:38.520
The cat's like, she looked like she wanted to get out and then, and then the moment Rob

43:38.520 --> 43:41.800
moved away, she's like, nah, sorry about that.

43:41.800 --> 43:46.000
It's quite all right, um, but, uh, no, it's a puzzle of its own that the cat's trying

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
to solve.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.280
She's having a whole little puzzle thing down here of her own, so, sorry, but, uh, no, it's,

43:53.280 --> 43:54.440
it's a nice little fun game.

43:54.440 --> 43:58.280
It's out on platforms, uh, iPhone and PC, right?

43:58.280 --> 43:59.600
iPhone, PC and Mac.

43:59.600 --> 44:00.600
Oh, okay.

44:00.600 --> 44:01.600
And Mac.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.600
Yep.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
Can't forget them.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.600
Uh, yeah.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.600
Okay.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
I think I've plugged enough.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.600
All right.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.600
No, that's no problem.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.600
We, we appreciate, uh, you being here.

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
You can plug whatever.

44:10.600 --> 44:13.600
Um, I'm not gonna, I don't, I don't even know what you're working on now.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.400
You probably couldn't talk about it anyway.

44:15.400 --> 44:19.720
Um, but, uh, best of luck with all the upcoming projects over there at Telltale and keep up

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
the good work.

44:20.720 --> 44:25.280
Oh, and just saying, there really, really should be an Elvira adventure game.

44:25.280 --> 44:30.360
Just so that you haven't heard last week's show, we're just thinking, you know, speaking

44:30.360 --> 44:35.600
of celebrities you want to get for the two old Elvira really needs a good, good game

44:35.600 --> 44:36.600
treatment.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.600
So just something to think about for next Halloween.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.600
Okay.

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
Just throwing that out there.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
Okay.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.600
Uh, let's see.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.160
I was trying to think what it was.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.160
I knew there was a game.

44:44.160 --> 44:45.160
Yes.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.160
It was the Elvira game.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.160
What was it?

44:47.160 --> 44:48.160
Was it Golden Girls?

44:48.160 --> 44:49.160
No, that wasn't.

44:49.160 --> 44:50.160
Well, that too, actually.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.320
But that's, that's going to be a little hard to do now.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.320
Yeah.

44:53.320 --> 44:55.480
You're not going to really be able to get Bea Arthur, but you might be able to get the

44:55.480 --> 45:00.680
drag queens that play the Golden Girls in San Francisco around the Thanksgiving season.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.680
Forget it.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.680
All right.

45:02.680 --> 45:03.680
Uh, let's see.

45:03.680 --> 45:04.680
My gaming week.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.360
I was all excited this week because Alan actually bought me a game and you'll appreciate this.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.800
Alan actually bought me a copy of Poker Night.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.560
Oh, bless his heart.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.560
Yes.

45:13.560 --> 45:16.160
He bought me a copy of Poker Night because Steam was having an awesome little pre-order

45:16.160 --> 45:18.280
thing on it and he's like, oh Rob, I bought you a game.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.280
Let's play the game.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.480
And then it's like, oh, the game's not out yet.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
Yeah.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.480
Not quite out yet.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.400
But I'll be ready to go.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.400
Day one.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.400
So thanks for that, Seg.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.400
No problem.

45:28.400 --> 45:34.440
I had to rash on that at some point, but no, I obviously it's, it's, it's going to be cute.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.600
You know, I'm, I'm not, I get, okay, I'll plug Poker Night.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.600
Fine.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.360
I'm not, I'm not looking for anything like, like my expectations going into this game

45:42.360 --> 45:45.820
are not like, I'm, my world is going to be rocked.

45:45.820 --> 45:49.200
It's just going to be like, it's going to be a cute poker game with funny characters.

45:49.200 --> 45:54.080
Well, we've, we've, we've been telling people like, yes, it's, it's Texas Hold'em Poker

45:54.080 --> 46:02.200
with, uh, Tycho, uh, the Heavy from TF2, Max of Salmon Max and Strong Bad.

46:02.200 --> 46:09.040
And it has more dialogue than any single episode of a Telltale game.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.040
Wow.

46:10.040 --> 46:14.880
So, you know, it's not going to be five lines repeated for every single play all the time.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.360
Every, you know, there's, there's going to be some variety to it.

46:18.360 --> 46:23.240
You know, and it's five bucks, you know, selling those like hotcakes at PAX actually, because

46:23.240 --> 46:24.920
we also threw in a poster with it.

46:24.920 --> 46:25.920
Nice.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.480
I tried for three days to buy it.

46:27.480 --> 46:28.960
What, how does that work?

46:28.960 --> 46:31.560
My PayPal hasn't ever, hasn't ever gone through, so.

46:31.560 --> 46:32.760
Well, now whose fault is that?

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
Not mine.

46:33.760 --> 46:39.040
It's Valve's problem, Steam or whatever.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.640
But uh, yeah, so Poker Night is, is coming out soon.

46:41.640 --> 46:42.640
Yeah.

46:42.640 --> 46:43.640
And, uh, they haven't even told me, so.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.640
I know, it's all good.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
So, all right.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.640
Well, that's, that's, that's really cool to know there's all that dialogue, because honestly,

46:48.640 --> 46:51.200
my expectations going in, I was thinking, okay, this is just going to be like an Xbox

46:51.200 --> 46:55.080
Live Arcade style poker game with, you know, characters I recognize.

46:55.080 --> 46:56.080
So that's cool.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.680
That's, that's, I hope there's a lot of trash talking.

46:58.680 --> 47:01.520
That sounds like it could be, could be a part of it with all that dialogue.

47:01.520 --> 47:06.320
Mouths are said.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.760
Words come out of mouths.

47:08.760 --> 47:14.280
There may or may not be playing cards in the game in some shape or fashion in Poker Night.

47:14.280 --> 47:17.020
All right, no, all right, all that stuff aside.

47:17.020 --> 47:18.020
So I have that to look forward to.

47:18.020 --> 47:21.920
I will say a game I did buy on Steam that is out and has been out for a month that I

47:21.920 --> 47:22.920
played this week.

47:22.920 --> 47:26.080
The listeners should be very proud of me because I don't think WoW was the game I played the

47:26.080 --> 47:30.600
most this week, shock and awe, but World of Warcraft was probably actually down there

47:30.600 --> 47:35.120
on the ladder this week because I finally got Civilization V on Steam and I've been

47:35.120 --> 47:40.480
playing the heck out of Civilization V because it's, um, it's great.

47:40.480 --> 47:45.040
It is probably, I haven't decided if I like it more than four yet because I haven't truly

47:45.040 --> 47:48.480
got to the end of a game yet because it is so long.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.680
Oh my gosh.

47:50.680 --> 47:51.680
But it's good.

47:51.680 --> 47:53.680
That's a good thing.

47:53.680 --> 47:58.320
But I definitely like, it's way better than two or three in my opinion, way, way better

47:58.320 --> 48:00.400
than three, that's for sure.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.400
But it's great.

48:01.400 --> 48:04.680
Um, the hex tile thing is actually one of the things I noticed the least.

48:04.680 --> 48:08.520
It's a very fluid transition for the series and a very kind of like logical next step.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.680
I really like a lot of the subtle changes they made.

48:10.680 --> 48:15.240
I like the fact you can't stack armies on top of each other and just like super army.

48:15.240 --> 48:19.840
I kind of like the fact that only one unit can defend a city so you can't have these

48:19.840 --> 48:23.480
Uber cities, you know, and just, just kind of like all these, like really, it makes you

48:23.480 --> 48:24.680
kind of have to think a different way.

48:24.680 --> 48:29.840
I like that they have talent trees that they call social policies basically.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.720
That's kind of a neat addition.

48:31.720 --> 48:35.920
There's all these cool little things they've added, very customizable games, lots of difficult,

48:35.920 --> 48:37.920
lots of difficulty levels, lots of sizes.

48:37.920 --> 48:40.120
The city states thing is really neat.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.160
I didn't think I would like it at first.

48:42.160 --> 48:48.400
A city state is basically a whole new civilization that is only ever one city.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.200
They don't aspire to grow.

48:50.200 --> 48:54.440
They don't aspire to do anything but exist in their little city state, but they can really

48:54.440 --> 48:58.240
make you or break you because if you, if you treat them well, then they give you gifts.

48:58.240 --> 49:03.280
They're like, we like you have a rifleman army courtesy of us.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.540
Or they might say, you are a jerk.

49:05.540 --> 49:09.920
We are going to pay the French to try to kill you, but ultimately they will surrender as

49:09.920 --> 49:11.920
they did to me earlier in the week.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
I got the French to surrender.

49:12.920 --> 49:13.920
Big surprise.

49:13.920 --> 49:18.120
That's like getting the sun to shine.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.360
I just had to work that in there somehow.

49:20.360 --> 49:24.820
Not only did I get the French to surrender, but the French gave me Pittsburgh.

49:24.820 --> 49:27.680
Really how they had that, or no, sorry, Philadelphia.

49:27.680 --> 49:31.240
How they had Philadelphia, I don't know, but I got it now.

49:31.240 --> 49:36.120
All of those sandwiches are so French, maybe the bread.

49:36.120 --> 49:41.120
It's now a Greek city in my game because of course I'm playing as Alexander the grape.

49:41.120 --> 49:44.920
Do you remember Otter Pops when you had Alexander the grape?

49:44.920 --> 49:45.920
Yes, I do.

49:45.920 --> 49:46.920
I want one.

49:46.920 --> 49:47.920
All right.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
Okay.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
It's not the show if we don't talk about food.

49:49.920 --> 49:50.920
I know.

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
I know.

49:51.920 --> 49:52.920
All right.

49:52.920 --> 49:53.920
So step five.

49:53.920 --> 49:54.920
Awesome.

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
Loving it.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
I haven't even touched the multiplayer end of it yet because I'm afraid to play against

49:56.920 --> 49:57.920
it because they're very good.

49:57.920 --> 49:58.920
Yeah, I haven't even done that.

49:58.920 --> 50:00.820
But long games.

50:00.820 --> 50:04.960
Like I am seriously playing on short mode and I've probably, like the shortest turns

50:04.960 --> 50:08.520
there is, and I've probably sunk at least a good three to four hours in this game and

50:08.520 --> 50:09.660
it's not done yet.

50:09.660 --> 50:12.560
Like I'm just now getting into like having like artilleries.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.560
Well, part of the game is-

50:14.560 --> 50:16.200
Well, it wasn't my city.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.200
Okay.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.600
I'm just saying you said the French gave it to you when you were in Greece.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.680
It's kind of interesting how that worked out.

50:21.680 --> 50:22.680
Okay.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.880
I totally forgot what I was going to say.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
Oh yeah.

50:25.880 --> 50:30.520
It's impressive is like you can always save, but it's always that one more turn.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.520
Yes.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.520
Yes.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.520
Oh God.

50:33.520 --> 50:34.520
Yes.

50:34.520 --> 50:35.520
That's what makes fun because it's always one more turn.

50:35.520 --> 50:38.840
I didn't go to bed till one AM the other night because of one more turn.

50:38.840 --> 50:43.800
Just one more turn and Paris will be mine.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.640
And it was.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.640
So just saying.

50:47.640 --> 50:51.640
The Fazenator said a junk ferret running around Paris will get France to surrender.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.640
By the way, I do want to also acknowledge our chat room.

50:53.640 --> 50:54.640
I've been such a bad boy.

50:54.640 --> 50:58.120
I haven't acknowledged chat all night long, chat.orangelaundry.com.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.120
Please join.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.120
They've actually been a little bit quiet tonight.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.120
I don't know.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.120
Chat room.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.120
Rob needs a spanking.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.120
Memorized by my voice.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.120
Maybe they're...

51:05.120 --> 51:06.120
Yes.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.120
Maybe they're just...

51:07.120 --> 51:09.520
Well, of course, sadly, we don't have a whole lot of people from the Bay Area.

51:09.520 --> 51:13.520
So I think we got a lot of people that are kind of like, oh, sounds cool, but plane tickets

51:13.520 --> 51:14.520
cost a lot.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.520
Yeah.

51:15.520 --> 51:16.520
But we do have...

51:16.520 --> 51:19.800
I know a lot of podcastees in the Bay, so hopefully we'll see a lot of them at the show.

51:19.800 --> 51:23.560
I know I'm going to go come hell or high water, so I'll be there for sure.

51:23.560 --> 51:27.760
Well, also, actually, for the...

51:27.760 --> 51:37.040
I don't know about other local physical events happening yet for Child's Play, but there's

51:37.040 --> 51:41.600
also Desert Bus for Hope, the loading ready run guys.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.920
They're starting...

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
I want to say them...

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
Actually, I know.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
I got it on the calendar.

51:46.920 --> 51:54.400
So these are the folks that play Desert Bus as a marathon run for Child's Play charity,

51:54.400 --> 52:00.920
and they start November 19th, unless things changed around a bit, but they'll do the live

52:00.920 --> 52:05.240
stream and all that on the 19th, which is definitely interesting to watch because, yes,

52:05.240 --> 52:08.360
they're playing Desert Bus, but they're also a comedy troupe, so they really make it a

52:08.360 --> 52:11.960
telethon show with it.

52:11.960 --> 52:12.960
Awesome.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.720
I've tuned into a little bit of it before.

52:15.720 --> 52:16.720
It's funny.

52:16.720 --> 52:17.720
It's funny sometimes.

52:17.720 --> 52:18.720
Also...

52:18.720 --> 52:19.720
What a crap game to be playing.

52:19.720 --> 52:20.720
Hmm?

52:20.720 --> 52:21.720
What a crap game to be playing.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.720
Yeah.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.720
So long.

52:23.720 --> 52:24.720
But...

52:24.720 --> 52:25.720
That's the joke.

52:25.720 --> 52:26.720
Hey, thanks for the money.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
All right.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
And also, UmLoud will be streamed live.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.640
I forgot about that.

52:30.640 --> 52:37.800
So starting at 7 p.m. California time, go to timeanddate.com to figure out what that

52:37.800 --> 52:40.040
means for you.

52:40.040 --> 52:45.280
The event will be streamed live, so you can actually watch the performances.

52:45.280 --> 52:50.000
The UmLoud website will change over to that mode when it's actually happening.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.960
And last year, weren't you the most streamed event in the lounge's history or something?

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
Well, no.

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
We killed their internet.

52:56.960 --> 52:57.960
Good job.

52:57.960 --> 53:02.760
Well, we didn't kill it, but we were the most...

53:02.760 --> 53:08.220
The one event that used the internet the most, this being from a venue that is currently

53:08.220 --> 53:14.360
owned by one of the co-founders of Netscape, so we're very proud of that, and they actually

53:14.360 --> 53:18.440
increased wireless capacity after that.

53:18.440 --> 53:25.000
I don't want to say it's because of us, but, you know, feather in our cap.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.600
All right.

53:26.600 --> 53:27.600
Congratulations on that.

53:27.600 --> 53:28.600
Thank you.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.600
All right.

53:29.600 --> 53:32.400
One more game that I played this week I want to talk about is DJ Hero 2.

53:32.400 --> 53:35.760
Even though Loki kind of already talked about that a little bit, I just want to give my

53:35.760 --> 53:39.160
spin on it, pun intended.

53:39.160 --> 53:43.040
I wasn't going to buy the game originally because I was like, oh, you have 60 bucks.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.040
I don't know.

53:44.040 --> 53:48.000
I played it in one of those in-store demos, and I was like, okay, I guess I got to buy

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
this because it actually is really fun.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.240
They've actually changed a lot about the default interface, and it's not just the vocals that

53:56.240 --> 54:00.880
have changed, but now they have freestyle cross-fading, freestyle button pressing that

54:00.880 --> 54:05.200
makes a lot more sense than it did in the first game where you had, you know, yeah,

54:05.200 --> 54:07.480
boy, over and over again with the button.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.200
I love the way they're doing the freestyling now.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.200
It's so much better.

54:10.200 --> 54:15.480
And the freestyle cross-fades are great, and the scratching zones are really cool, so many

54:15.480 --> 54:20.320
more ways to freestyle and really ruin such great songs.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.840
I do appreciate all of that they've thrown in the interface.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.800
The head-to-head modes are more interesting.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.600
I like the interface as a whole.

54:27.600 --> 54:31.960
Even though the black and white look is a little bit, like, too plain, I just kind of

54:31.960 --> 54:35.840
like the construction of the game a lot more than I did the first mix.

54:35.840 --> 54:42.080
So it's a worthy upgrade in the interface and what it brings to the table.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.500
I gotta be honest, though.

54:43.500 --> 54:47.240
I don't think the song list is as good as the first game, at least the parts I've played

54:47.240 --> 54:48.240
so far.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.020
There have been a few really good mixes.

54:50.020 --> 54:53.120
Like there's this one I can't even get out of my head.

54:53.120 --> 54:56.440
It's the one that has Rihanna's Rude Boy in it that I can't get that sample out of my

54:56.440 --> 54:57.440
head.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.440
I'm a rude boy, boy.

54:58.440 --> 54:59.440
I'm a rude...

54:59.440 --> 55:01.300
And it's mixed with some other, like, slower R&B song.

55:01.300 --> 55:03.480
It's a really good mix.

55:03.480 --> 55:07.880
There was some, like, weird ones that I didn't recognize the song.

55:07.880 --> 55:12.320
There was one with a Tiesto song that was, like, an R&B song or something mixed with

55:12.320 --> 55:13.320
it.

55:13.320 --> 55:16.160
It was surprisingly good, actually.

55:16.160 --> 55:19.880
I will hopefully play those during the break.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
I'm attempting...

55:20.880 --> 55:22.640
This is like disarming a bomb over here.

55:22.640 --> 55:23.640
It's all right.

55:23.640 --> 55:24.640
It's all right.

55:24.640 --> 55:25.640
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

55:25.640 --> 55:26.640
No, it's gonna work.

55:26.640 --> 55:27.640
I've got the stuff to make it work.

55:27.640 --> 55:28.640
It's gonna work!

55:28.640 --> 55:29.640
You don't understand, Rob.

55:29.640 --> 55:32.640
We're not gonna stop and ask for directions.

55:32.640 --> 55:33.640
All right.

55:33.640 --> 55:34.640
One more bit of housekeeping.

55:34.640 --> 55:35.640
Please.

55:35.640 --> 55:36.640
Contest!

55:36.640 --> 55:37.640
Yes.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.640
Well, I wasn't done with my gaming week, but that's okay.

55:39.640 --> 55:40.640
They didn't finish.

55:40.640 --> 55:41.640
I got a cookie.

55:41.640 --> 55:45.920
I don't know what else to say about DJ Hero 2 that Loki didn't already say.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.480
If you like the first game, you're gonna like this game.

55:48.480 --> 55:51.520
I'm just a little bit disappointed in the soundtrack.

55:51.520 --> 55:54.020
There's some really good songs, though, don't get me wrong, and I think there's something

55:54.020 --> 55:57.040
for everyone here, but let me just put it this way.

55:57.040 --> 56:02.120
Like, I was threatened with domestic repercussions by my significant other if I played any song

56:02.120 --> 56:07.280
that had Soulja Boy in it one more time, so just putting that out there.

56:07.280 --> 56:14.960
If you're not a fan of some of these big club hits, you're gonna be in for a world of pain,

56:14.960 --> 56:15.960
so that's it.

56:15.960 --> 56:16.960
All right.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.320
Now we can get to housekeeping.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.320
Join our Facebook.

56:19.320 --> 56:20.520
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

56:20.520 --> 56:21.520
Join our Twitter.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.040
Twitter.com slash OLR.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.440
Dark Soccer has a contest.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.440
Okay.

56:25.440 --> 56:30.400
This is our contest, and the prize is going to be a code for Xbox Live to play Castlevania

56:30.400 --> 56:35.840
Symphony of the Night, which is a fun game, one of my favorites.

56:35.840 --> 56:43.120
The question is really easy, and we are going to be taking an emailer at a random number,

56:43.120 --> 56:49.220
which we will decide by literally rolling a die on the show.

56:49.220 --> 56:55.440
This is in relation to Comic Insanity, which is the other podcast that I do, and we broadcast

56:55.440 --> 57:05.240
every... We're actually up on Infamous, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net on Mondays is when the new podcast is up.

57:05.240 --> 57:11.480
The question you have to answer is what is the name of he who shall not be named on Comic

57:11.480 --> 57:12.480
Insanity?

57:12.480 --> 57:15.200
I'll give you a clue.

57:15.200 --> 57:18.200
We hate him.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.480
That so narrows it down.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.480
Wow.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
That could be anybody.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.380
It's me.

57:23.380 --> 57:31.520
Then you can send your emails to... I guess go ahead and send it to the mailbag here.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.520
I'll check it.

57:32.520 --> 57:34.760
Mailbag at OrangeDownsRadio.com.

57:34.760 --> 57:39.640
I will sift through it, and we will roll a number at random, and I'll pick a name.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.640
Awesome.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.640
Now the other contest.

57:41.640 --> 57:42.640
More?

57:42.640 --> 57:45.480
Which isn't us, but a lot of people would be interested in this.

57:45.480 --> 57:52.120
Also at Infamous.net, there is a contest to win a bunch of Blizzard goodies from Blizzcon.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.620
If you missed it, there's stuff for you.

57:54.620 --> 58:01.880
There are free pets, Cataclysm stuff.

58:01.880 --> 58:12.480
There's also a demo of Starcraft 2, and a few Starcraft 2 lithos, and some goodies.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.480
Lots of goodies.

58:13.480 --> 58:14.480
Lots of stuff.

58:14.480 --> 58:15.480
What do I have to do?

58:15.480 --> 58:16.480
Just send it a name?

58:16.480 --> 58:22.100
You have to go to Infamous.net and click on the contest link, and it's, again, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net

58:22.100 --> 58:25.520
... and click on the Blizzard contest.

58:25.520 --> 58:26.520
Follow the directions.

58:26.520 --> 58:29.440
You just basically have to fill out your information, let them know what you're looking most forward

58:29.440 --> 58:33.320
to for Cataclysm, which, you know what my response was?

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
Nothing.

58:34.320 --> 58:40.280
Except maybe Plants vs. Zombies, but I don't play World of Warcraft, so, meh.

58:40.280 --> 58:42.520
You've been tempted to go back a couple times, though.

58:42.520 --> 58:43.520
I have been.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.520
Don't make me go find the time stamps.

58:44.520 --> 58:47.440
Well, just because Tiara told me that leveling is faster now.

58:47.440 --> 58:48.440
It is.

58:48.440 --> 58:49.440
And in Cataclysm, it's going to be even better.

58:49.440 --> 58:53.240
I hated leveling in freakin' World of Warcraft, so...

58:53.240 --> 58:54.240
Boo hoo.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.240
Alright.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.240
I'm just messing.

58:56.240 --> 59:00.640
Star Trek Online is much more fun, because I can kill Borg and play with Klingons.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.920
How's that working out for you?

59:01.920 --> 59:03.160
Stupid fuckin' Borg.

59:03.160 --> 59:04.160
Alright.

59:04.160 --> 59:05.160
Anyhow.

59:05.160 --> 59:06.160
I hate you, Borg.

59:06.160 --> 59:07.160
You know what's funny?

59:07.160 --> 59:09.440
I was on TV today, and I had to let my son watch it.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.760
Wrath of Khan in HD.

59:10.760 --> 59:16.680
I was like, well, Josh, this is the best Star Trek movie ever, so you better watch.

59:16.680 --> 59:19.960
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but that's not, that's not to say he was bored.

59:19.960 --> 59:20.960
He just...

59:20.960 --> 59:21.960
He's tired.

59:21.960 --> 59:22.960
Well, baby, sleep.

59:22.960 --> 59:23.960
Have you taken him to the theater yet?

59:23.960 --> 59:25.840
Make sure that you take him to an epic movie in the theater when he's still an infant,

59:25.840 --> 59:27.560
so that can be his first movie.

59:27.560 --> 59:28.560
Definitely.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.240
Mine was Star Wars.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.720
Good stuff.

59:31.720 --> 59:32.720
Yep.

59:32.720 --> 59:33.720
Alright.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.000
Well, this might be a new record, guys.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.520
We're an hour into the show, and we have yet to touch gaming news.

59:37.520 --> 59:38.520
Woo hoo!

59:38.520 --> 59:39.520
Woo hoo!

59:39.520 --> 59:41.240
That's alright, so we're gonna kinda quickly move through some gaming news tonight.

59:41.240 --> 59:43.400
Uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

59:43.400 --> 59:47.440
Some gaming news, if you can get away through the MacGyver stuff for a moment, I don't know.

59:47.440 --> 59:49.440
I got the work, by the way.

59:49.440 --> 59:50.440
Um, of course.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.160
I am awesome like that.

59:52.160 --> 59:58.320
Xbox.com has gotten a makeover to kind of update everything, you know, with the new

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.960
dashboard updates coming soon and whatnot.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:06.560
They've added avatar editors on the actual website, so now you don't have to wait till

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.240
you get to your console to make your avatar look neat.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:17.440
Um, then also, apparently, they're gonna add some multiplayer web games, which, um, that's

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440
cool, I guess.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:24.680
I don't know if it's gonna be some more stuff that you can, um, do for, like, eh, if it's

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.280
gonna tie in with different games, you know, like how they did with Crackdown and Facebook

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.240
games and stuff, um, perhaps, but, uh, right now they're saying that they're gonna be able

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:38.660
to play web games with your Xbox Live friends on the web or on Windows Phone 7, and, um,

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.400
I'm sure those will be fun.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400
Yeah.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:47.240
Uh, and this is all, of course, uh, this already came out this week, and, um, so go check it

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.240
out.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.640
Are any of those free games available yet?

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.080
The web stuff, or?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.320
They were just teasing them.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320
Yeah.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.480
They haven't really made them available yet, but the avatar editor's there, so you can

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.680
check that out at least.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.120
They'll be coming out soon.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.100
Um, yeah, I'm glad that they actually updated the website, because there was a lot of stuff

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:10.200
that was broken on there, like, you know, links to games and stuff, you're, okay, I

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.840
wanna look up stuff about Crackdown 2, okay, that page doesn't exist.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.040
Well, when was the last time they changed that, that, the look of the page?

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.360
I think it was even before the-

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.960
The new Xbox experience.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.200
I think it was before the Xbox 360's launch, I mean-

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.200
Yeah.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.200
No, I wanna say they had a change.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200
I wanna say they did change it with MXC.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.200
No, I think they did update it with the 360.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200
Yeah.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.440
I mean, it seems that they're doing this, this was more of, in line with the Windows

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.560
phone, and all that, and they're trying to-

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.760
Yeah, they're really pushing this-

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:45.400
They're really pushing the phone, because, you know, let's face it, they're a competitor.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400
Yeah.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.840
Well, and let's also not forget that, you know, there's some stories this week about

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:55.000
how AT&T is really starting to get behind these phones, because the rumors are starting

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.200
to snowball a little more that they are going Verizon with the iPhone in 2011.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:06.160
And so AT&T is actually going to start pushing a lot more the Windows phone, I mean, not

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.720
to say they're not gonna sell the iPhone anymore, but they're gonna also be pushing the Windows

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720
phones-

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.720
Diversify the portfolio.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.720
Exactly, exactly.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.720
So, it'll be interesting to see if there's any truth to these so-called rumors.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:27.960
The thing I will say about this with the Xbox.com site that I wish Sony would do, is when you

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:35.240
hear about a game that's available as a downloadable service, at least with Xbox, you can, if you're

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.240
at work and you hear about it, you can buy it on the site, and you don't have to be at

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.840
your Xbox, and you can make that purchase or say, okay, I want the demo.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.960
So then, when you get back to your Xbox, it'll be downloaded, waiting for you, and remind

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.760
you that you wanted to look at the thing and play it.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.160
There's also just a lot more content on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.880
There's always at least a couple games coming out each week, versus Sony, there may be a

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.440
game coming out that week.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.360
It's not consistent.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360
Unless you count-

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.360
No, it's being consistent.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360
It's-

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.980
Unless you count their old PlayStation 1 classics that they're putting out.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.880
I mean, they could, really, for the both of them, they need to make, well, Xbox needs

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.120
to make their indie game service or whatever, community games, however the fuck they're

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.320
calling it now, they need to make it more like the App Store, where it's not just games,

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.160
it's applications and stuff, and make it more, instead of just, oh, kind of, we're putting

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.480
this in the back corner of our Marketplace, make it more-

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480
Showcased.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:41.960
Yes, exactly, because with the App Store, it's easy to spend money like crazy on a

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.840
thing, and if they made it more like that, and had like, okay, hey, look, this feature

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:52.240
now has, you know, weather updates, and this app does, you know, this and this, you know,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.920
I think that would be beneficial for them, especially since they don't have a web browser.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.160
All right, well, I will say, though, one thing about the website, one thing I tried to look

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:09.160
up was the Game Room website, yeah, I wasn't there, I had to do a search for it, something

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.640
not pretty is going on with Game Room, I'm sorry to say, but we'll see, just to kind

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.240
of follow up a little bit from last week.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.920
Let me move on with some of the other big, big news this week, of course, something that

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.600
was on a lot of people's minds, and this is really one of those, like, either you were

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.080
watching every second of it, or you just kind of didn't care, BlizzCon was going on this

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080
weekend.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:32.560
Surprisingly, though, not quite the amount of information I think folks were expecting

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.880
out of BlizzCon this year.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.560
Yes, there were some announcements, there were a few things, Diablo 3 seemed to be the

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.000
most announcements, which wasn't a huge surprise to anyone, really, because we all know that

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.080
Blizzard is pushing Diablo 3.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.640
Diablo 3's latest class, the Demon Hunter, is revealed, and that is supposedly the last

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.160
class that's going to be in the game.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.520
Also, PvP Battle Arenas, that does sound kind of cool, that is also coming to Diablo 3.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.880
Those are some of the big announcements.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.640
One thing that was missing, though, was when?

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:07.760
Not even a hint of a quarter or a year, really, for Diablo 3, so we're all left to just speculate

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.840
as to the release date, otherwise it's pretty much just soon.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.120
On the World of Warcraft front, there really wasn't a lot to say.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.020
Cataclysm is coming out on December 7th.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.520
One of the things they confirmed is that they are going to be doing digital distribution

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.520
day one.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:28.480
You will be able to download Cataclysm and play the minute it launches, which some might

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.800
see as kind of a kick in the gut to some of the Game Stops and Best Buys of the world.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.200
Of course, you won't be able to get the Collector's Edition online.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.080
Maybe this is just a way for Blizzard to get people to buy both.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.280
I don't know, because I do know people that will buy both.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.200
They will buy this just so they can be there minute one, and then they'll go buy the Collector's

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.920
Edition, because they are suckers.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920
Addicts!

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920
Yes, and addicts.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920
Buy more stuff.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.960
I love them, but they're addicts and suckers.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960
Alright.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.800
Also, the Moonkin Hatchling is going to be the next World of Warcraft pet that is sold

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
in the store.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.040
The rumor is it's another charity pet.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.240
I really couldn't get clear one way or the other if it's a charity pet or not, but they

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.040
have confirmed that that is coming to the store.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.120
Starcraft 2 is going to be getting some scenarios for it.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.280
One of them is a Defense of the Ancients scenario, also Bejeweled and Left 4 Dead, some other

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.560
interesting little kind of like versions of those in Starcraft 2.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.360
But I find the Defense of the Ancients one of the most interesting, because Valve, of

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.560
course, has their Defense of the Ancients game.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.600
They actually got the people who originally did the mod now work at Valve, but yet Blizzard

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.920
is now going to make their own.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.040
It's very interesting.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:35.580
So you're going to have Starcraft, or what they're calling Blizzard Defense of the Ancients,

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.600
is going to be coming to Starcraft 2 soon.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.280
Again, no date there.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.900
So yep, folks went to BlizzCon.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.800
Some guy broke his leg while dancing.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.400
Tenacious D played.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.840
People spent 150 bucks.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.480
Hope you guys found it worth it.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.360
I really don't have any interest.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.160
As much as I'm an addict of War Program, I have no interest in BlizzCon.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160
You know what?

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.800
It's also $150.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.080
What's that, Seg?

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:03.720
Ultimate Band Package for Umcloud on sale on November 1st.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.320
And I tell you, that's probably more exciting.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320
That's probably a better deal.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.760
Honestly, you guys, maybe you can't say this year, are you guys doing the swag bag again

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.920
for the Ultimate Bands this year?

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.360
Oh yeah, I mean we don't know what's going to be in it, but we're going to do a bag.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.320
You're probably going to get better shit in those bags than you do in the BlizzCon bags.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320
I think the BlizzCon bags...

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.560
I can say that too, you'll get better stuff.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.400
Did they even get a pet this year in the BlizzCon bags?

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.480
Yeah, they got another, it was another Murloc, I think.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.480
It was...

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480
That, yeah.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480
That's it.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.200
It was a Deathwing Murloc, I think.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200
So many.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.200
Was that correct?

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200
That's part of the giveaway.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200
There's so many.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.920
They can go win one off Infamous Gamers and don't spend $150 to get a swag bag.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:48.640
I actually looked at the live blog for it, and I was like, so they announced a new class

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.240
for Diablo, and that was it?

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.500
I wonder if they didn't originally intend to announce the date for Cataclysm, but they

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:04.640
got beaten to it by an inadvertent leak, because they were able to deduce, MMO-Champion deduced

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.320
the release date of the game by things that were delivered in one of the patches.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.600
I'm not going to get into all the specifics, I don't want to bore the non-WOW players.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.600
But basically...

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.000
There was some update that was supposed to happen a week after the Cataclysm event came

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.360
out, and they dated that update, so...

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360
Yes.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.360
Exactly.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.560
And we have deduced that it is December 7th.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.920
So anyhow, that's what went on at BlizzCon, otherwise you had angry gamers asking questions

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.120
and raging in the microphone at Blizz developers, because everybody's so mature, so that's all

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.880
the stuff you missed.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.800
I tried to get people on Twitter to, I'm like, if you're going to rage question, then at

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.880
least rage question about real ID.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:54.720
Do something that actually affects your real life, instead of like, stop nerfing my paladin!

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.680
But I will say, if I may, since I am a Warcraft player and I'm teasing myself here a little

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.680
bit.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680
You may.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.260
That new patch that Blizzard did, although I really like some of the features and some

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.680
of the changes they did, boy did they screw some things up.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.840
Like they have this bug in there right now, where like an icon turning into a certain

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.040
shape will crash the entire game.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.560
It's called the cogwheel bug.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.000
And what's great about it is that for the Halloween event, in order to summon the Halloween

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.420
boss, you gotta click the cogwheel on the Headless Horseman thing, the pumpkin, so pretty

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.040
much everybody crashes out.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:36.600
They've been able to fix it with a third party fix that's available on Curse, but yeah, Blizzard's

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.660
too busy throwing their party to really be on top of that right now.

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660
So whatever.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.440
Maybe I won't go back and play it.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.840
This new patch needed a little more testing, but Blizzard really wanted that game out this

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840
year so whatever.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.000
At least it's not as much of a hot mess as another certain MMO that came out and they

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.760
had to extend the trial period of the game because it was so terrible.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.880
But anyhow, I'm not gonna go there again for another week.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880
Alright.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880
You don't understand, Rob.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.640
It still is the trial part of the game.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.120
It will be the trial part of the game for the next few years.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.700
All I have to say is some of my friends who I was really close with in the game before

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:18.440
that have apparently gone into this new game and have said, oh wow, it's bad.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.180
Like it is really, really bad.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.480
Like I'll stick with Final Fantasy 11.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.160
Pretty well, yes.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.040
I was trying to be nice and not name names.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.600
Final Fantasy 14, that's right.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600
That's the game that sucks.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.600
Final Fantasy 14 is fucking terrible, ahhh!

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.600
It's terrible.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600
I can't hold it in anymore.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600
It blows.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.840
It's a brand new game.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.000
We have the same races, but we need them something more ridiculous and it sucks worse.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.920
Although I do remember one MMO that I played that was in beta for like seven years.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
Ragnarok.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.560
Ragnarok.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.000
And I played through the whole thing in several different languages.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.760
They better not hear you talking smack on our show or we ban you.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.760
I love Ragnarok.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.760
Permanently.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760
You know, this must be...

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.040
My account can't be banned on Ragnarok, even though I don't play anymore on the IRO server.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040
Who'd you blow?

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.880
Because I was a beta tester.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:13.800
All the beta accounts that played for the PVP testing got to keep their accounts.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.800
It's good to know.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800
Yeah.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800
Alright.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.960
It must be a key to my personality, but the only MMO I've actually played with some length

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.680
was Myst Online.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.480
Myst Online was kind of creepy.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:31.760
Myst Online was a great idea, and man, Zombie Game refused to die.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.000
I mean, that game got relaunched about four times.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And it was great.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.480
It just needed...

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:47.360
There were just things that hung it up on interface-wise.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.960
And narrative-based MMO.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.920
That's a huge beast to fill.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.340
Let's see.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.640
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.000
Tigerclaw says, talking about Blizzcon, one fan complained about the WoW characters looking

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.880
like they came from Victoria's Secrets.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.280
The developer replied, what magazine do you want them to look like?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.280
Penthouse!

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.880
Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat says, all the WoW players moved on to a better game.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.040
Hello Kitty Island Adventures.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.040
You know what's funny?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.680
Is that we were at Target the other day, and there was Final Fantasy XIV sitting on the

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.360
shelf, and Alan's like, you should buy that.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.400
He's like, hey, hey, you should buy that.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400
You should buy that.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.920
I'm like, I will buy this before I buy that, and I pointed at Hello Kitty Online.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.000
You know that Hello Kitty is getting her first Wii game coming in November.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
No one curr.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Alright.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
What?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You're not a fan.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.720
I remember me picking up a certain Batsmaru Hello Kitty game, and Rob going, oh girl,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.120
I want to play that!

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.320
And me lending it to him.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.880
Says the person that has the Hello Kitty toaster.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880
I deny these allegations.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880
And Coffee Baker.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880
All of them.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
I actually, I actually got.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880
And a Hello Kitty TV.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.880
Hold on.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.400
Actually, it was a Disney Princess TV for one.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400
That's much better.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:05.640
I gave it to a seven-year-old girl, and the Hello Kitty Coffee Maker is no more.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640
It's gone.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.960
I got a real Coffee Maker.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960
Yeah, I know.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960
Alright, anyhow.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.280
You know what, Rob?

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.240
If you really want to be cool, you'll just get a French press.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240
Rob blinks.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.680
Moving on with more gaming news.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.680
Someone's phone farted.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.240
Well, this is a lot more cool than, a lot cooler than World of Warcraft, as I mess up

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.520
my adjectives.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.840
Space Channel 5 Part 2, yes, the one with the full-on thriller Dance with Space Michael

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.400
and apparently Ulala grabbing her crotch, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.520
Network, along with Sega Bass Fishing.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:51.400
We will see them in early 2011, and the good thing about Space Channel 5 Part 2 is that

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.000
we never got it in North America, so this means we get to play it.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.360
Like, there's really a whole bunch of Japanese in it to change.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360
I mean...

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.440
Didn't we get, we got it on PlayStation 2 version, didn't we?

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.680
Yeah, I think so.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680
I don't know.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.400
I've got the Japanese one.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.440
With that freaking hard one where it does all the stuff and you have to do it backwards?

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.440
Oh my god.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.800
Anyway, so yeah, but it's a Mizuguchi game.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.800
It's really fun.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:20.760
Space Channel 5, really, really like it, and I love Space Channel 5 Part 2, mainly because

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.160
of the thriller dance, the whole section where they do just Michael Jackson dances.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.160
And Pudding is especially fierce in Part 2.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.240
I'm Pudding.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.760
She's my favorite, just for the record.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.800
Pudding is my favorite character.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.360
And Shermie has left the studio.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.680
You notice she did not step on your laptop?

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.680
She's good that way.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.680
Good kitty.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.680
Yeah.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.680
Alright.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.620
Crushed his laptop.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:50.160
She is not that huge, and she knows better than to step on laptops because we got onto

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160
her.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160
She'll get a kitty spanking.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160
Alright, moving on.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
She likes it.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160
More gaming news.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.800
Shermie does like spankings, by the way.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:58.800
We don't need to know that.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:14:59.800
She puts her butt-

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.800
It's her family show!

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800
You're not her family show.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.800
No, for real.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.800
Like, if you-

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800
Fuck family shows!

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.800
If you pet her on her lower back, she'll stick her butt up in the air and start purring.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.240
I don't need to know what your cat's into.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.600
Does your cat want a leather harness for Christmas?

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.640
No, she's not into that.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.720
I'm sorry, your Hanukkah?

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.320
My cat's not Jewish.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320
She's agnostic.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.720
Okay.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:30.600
Apparently, there was a re- or, Ubisoft is recalling Shaun White's skateboarding on the

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.460
PlayStation 3, which means I'm gonna have a lot of fuckin' work to do tomorrow because

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:40.160
they've already shipped them all to us so that we got them to our customers, so we're

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.240
gonna have to do a bunch of fuckin' returns on it.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.380
But apparently, and this was coming from some big name retailers, they're saying that there

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:57.320
is issues with quality of the game, apparently, according to Sony, it says there was a manufacturing

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:02.200
issue with misprinted disc at Sony Computer Entertainment America, and the wrong version

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:07.040
of Shaun White's skateboarding PS3 was shipped to retailers.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.600
We were working with Ubisoft to correct the issue.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.800
New PS3 copies will be shipped to North American retailers by Thursday, October 28th, and it

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.320
will be available by that weekend.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.320
Thanks.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:24.080
Thanks for all the work, you fuckin' dumbasses.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.720
Duh, we printed it wrong!

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.120
Well, now Loki mistakes happen.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.120
Yeah.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.120
Whatever.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.600
You just don't like having the work.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.280
Was there some Arab song in this that someone got offended about, you know, playing the

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.000
beta or something, like LittleBigPlanet?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.520
I did get one of those copies, and really, it was stupid.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.800
I liked it better with the lyrics in the game.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.920
I think Shaun White's skateboarding is intentionally supposed to be that bad, so that's a feature.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.840
Is this a big title, or is this...

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
No.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.340
I'm like, how many people buy this game?

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.160
Most people are like, Shaun White?

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.640
Who the fuck's he?

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.200
Isn't that the snowboarder?

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.200
Isn't that the guy that looks like Carrot Top?

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.440
Yes, it is the guy that looks like Carrot Top.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440
He actually sk-

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440
I know who it is!

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.920
He actually skateboards, but Tony Hawk has a game coming out, you know, Tony Hawk's

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.920
charrette, and as far as I'm aware, Tony Hawk does not fucking snowboard, so...

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.920
He's a poser.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920
No.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920
I don't know.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.920
That game is terrible.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.920
Not the Shaun White game.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.400
Shaun White game is decent, but Tony Hawk's terrible.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.920
Well if Shaquille O'Neal can do everything, like, you know, he had that whole TV show

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.680
about Shaquille O'Neal does this and that, then, you know, why can't Tony Hawk decide

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680
to-

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.600
And they're doing comic-style art of him.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.920
Shaquille O'Neal?

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.840
And, cause, with the new, uh, Celtics lineup.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:45.760
We, but, you can listen to Infamous, uh,.NET's, uh, Comic Insanity for that.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.760
Plug plug.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.920
Uh, Salacious Pop is bringing us some LOLs in chat, um, has anyone actually seen Shaun

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.920
White?

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.160
What he needs is a line of shampoo and hair care, not video games.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.760
Uh, also, Salacious Pop, uh, mentioning Shermie, was, uh, walking out, and Salacious Pop was

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.120
suggesting, um, uh, talk about the Sony move so she'll poop in the hall.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.720
She does that, every time we bring it up, she goes out in the hall and takes a big crap.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.320
I've got something better, um, I, uh, noticed when I was in the Sony Marketplace this weekend

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:17.920
that there is a preview download for, is Shermie listening?

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.120
Shermie, the tester season 2 has a preview trailer available.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.520
Do not get my cat to take a crap, because guess who has to clean that shit up?

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520
Me!

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520
Literally.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.140
Just say, the tester season 2, Shermie.

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:37.120
And again, disclaimer, my cat is old and fat and can't get to the bathroom easily.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.520
She's fat and sassy.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.080
Let's talk about something else that's going to be very sassy, at least for, uh, fans of

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080
these series.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080
As long as it doesn't involve cat shit.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.080
No, it doesn't involve that.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.800
Uh, Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright are going to be colliding.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.140
Worlds are colliding in a new 3DS adventure.

01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:00.400
What I love about this is that these are, like, two very culty kind of games on the

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.400
DS.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.640
Like, either you play them and you love them, or you're like, what is this, I don't even

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640
know.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.920
So, somehow, and I, of course I'm looking at this going, how does this even work?

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.680
How do these two games even, alright, whatever.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.080
Did you watch the trailer?

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.920
I didn't, to be honest.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.680
Oh, no, the Japanese trailer is out.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.720
Yeah, there's actually a good high res one out, though.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.720
Oh, is there?

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.720
Yeah.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.940
Um, but it was really cool.

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:33.200
I sat and watched the whole thing going, haha, I can only understand half of this.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.600
Well, and it's going to be on the 3DS, and that's kind of awesome.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.040
That's the noise you hear in the background, by the way, is a little bit of the trailer,

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.920
but that's like somebody filming an actual screen there.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.640
But anyhow, this is one of the four surprise titles that Level 5 has been working on.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:53.660
They are doing this whole, it's a combination of puzzles and crime mystery.

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.360
You know, I guess that could kind of make sense.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.040
Are they biting a little bit from the other puzzle game?

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:04.720
This is the FBI, the whole FBI investigation, this is starting to sound a little familiar.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.600
Say, guys, you might want to look into exploring a lawsuit on this, I don't know.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm just starting crap.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.440
You know, I mean, I'm excited for it.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:22.360
You know, I mean, it's the kind of thing of like, this can go horribly, horribly wrong,

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.640
but there's a chance that it can go horribly, horribly right.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.640
But it'll be in 3D!

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:35.640
Well, no, but seriously, though, I wait in eager anticipation to what this turns out.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:41.200
I haven't read up on it or anything, I don't think they even published much to anything,

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:48.920
and it's probably in Japanese, and I'm a Gaijin, that's the right word, right?

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.580
If you were in Japan, then yeah, you'd be Gaijin, but no, it's great, it starts off

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:59.240
with someone being interviewed in court, and then you see the professor there, he's like,

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.120
oh, talking, talking, and all of a sudden, this finger pops up, and this guy comes out

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.960
of the shadows and goes, subscribe mas!

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.960
As in, objection.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960
Objection!

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.800
That means you're wrong.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:16.640
I love this way it's described here by Level 5 president Akihiro Hino, quote, two TV shows

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.100
getting together and making a movie.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.560
So it's like Facts of Life meets Golden Girls, basically.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:25.640
There's got to be tons of cinematics from what they should, the trailer was long.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.520
I mean, really long.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.560
Well, I bet that's going to be pretty awesome, actually, so.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560
Very cool.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.400
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get into release dates?

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.240
Something that's even better than Sonic 4.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.080
And you know how we feel about Sonic 4.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.200
I mean, aw, okay.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.740
There are a group of Sonic fans, actually two people, that brought out something called

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.920
Sonic Fan Remix that is actually absolutely gorgeous.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:02.300
I played it before the show, and didn't you think it was?

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.300
It was pretty.

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.300
It was pretty.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.300
Very pretty.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.760
It's got different mechanics from different Sonic games thrown in, except for the Dash

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760
thing.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.200
It looks gorgeous.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.920
I really think that, now one thing that I did notice when reading up on this is that

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:22.520
they actually brought in tons of elements from Sonic CD, which that's really how it

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:27.880
felt to me, playing, like it is playing Sonic CD.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.680
But they're doing so much of a better job than what Sega is doing, I mean, Sega should

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.240
just be like, hey, we like you.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.920
But the people that are doing it is Pelican 13 and Mercury.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.960
The demo is out to download.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.720
You can go to Sonic Retro and find it.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.840
They also do have a direct, let me get the link for it real quick, because there actually

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.840
is a direct...

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.560
There's some comments from our chat about this from some people that have played it.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.840
Burr is in our chat room and says, my only criticism of Sonic Fan Remix is the backgrounds

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.400
are so busy it can be hard to see.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.600
That's the problem that I had with it, too.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.280
I mean, really, that was the one problem I had with it.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:17.200
Okay, the website is just SonicFanRemix.com, all one word except for the dot com, which

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.400
is a dot and a comma.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.560
All right, how long until Sega files a lawsuit?

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.080
Anyone, anyone, anyone?

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.080
Anyone?

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.080
Sega should be embarrassed.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.920
And then they'll file a lawsuit.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.800
No, seriously, Rob, bring up the trailer, play some of the music, because the music

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.800
is gorgeous.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800
Sure.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.800
Let me bring that up here from the website.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800
What did you think?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.760
Yeah, my only, you know, I didn't, I was just looking over your shoulder for it, but definitely

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:47.120
the backgrounds are sort of like, too busy and it kind of illustrates how they're really

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:52.560
going to 11 with the art, like, hey, look what we're doing, and gets a little too, just

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.600
on the edge of showboaty with it.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.600
Yeah.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.840
But not stupid.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.840
It's noticeable, but it's not stupid.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.360
It's not completely detrimental to the game itself.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.760
I think it'd be something to get used to.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.080
Very pretty looking.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.400
I love some of the like interactive backgrounds, even though, yeah, the multi-layered background

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.360
thing can get a little busy, but it kind of detracts.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.880
I really love some of what they did with it.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:22.880
Looks hot.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.920
I like it when it gets into my favorite part of this music.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.920
Kudos.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:28.920
Oh, which was next?

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:29.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920
There you go.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920
There you go.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920
Yeah.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920
All right.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.240
I love that, that little like shark thing that jumps out as he's running over the bridge.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.600
It's like a big killer whale, I think.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.920
Little touches like that are awesome.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.160
And it even knocks, the blocks are all that same checkerboard pattern all around it.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.160
It's pretty fantastic.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:53.680
I'd have to say that this is an epic job and I hope it doesn't get shut down the way that

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.160
the Chrono Trigger thing was, because that was also awesome.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.520
Well, Burr apparently has been following this pretty closely.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.000
He has a follow-up comment here in our chat room at chat.orangewise.com.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.920
The people on the forums about it say Sega won't do anything about it.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.880
Not sure why they're so confident.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.880
Hmm.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880
Interesting.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.880
All right.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.560
Well, definitely worth checking out.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.960
Grab it now until it becomes a problem.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960
That's my suggestion.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.960
All right.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.960
Let's go get some release dates.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.240
So, Loki, I know there's a lot this week, but I just want to point out we're already

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:28.360
at an hour and a half for part A, so.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.280
In other words, if we cut out the Hello Kitty games, I think we'll be okay.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280
No, don't worry.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280
I won't read any Hello Kitty.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.280
I need more Hello Kitty!

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:41.720
Uh, Shaun White's skateboarding actually came out today on Xbox 360, and we're disavowing

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.360
any knowledge of the PS3 version, because that's not yet ready.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.120
The re-release of Dragon Age Origins, the Ultimate Edition, it's packed with all the

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:56.720
download content, including the expansion Awakenings, and you can get that this week.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.880
Family Party 90 Great Games Party Pack that is also a compilation of the last three Family

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.880
Party games.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.880
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:04.880
90 awesome games.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.440
Uh, they're really popular, actually.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.920
You'd be surprised.

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:13.240
Um, and like I said, Dragon Age Origins, that was on PC, PS3, and 360.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.160
Art Academy is a collection of two DSi games that came out previously.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.120
That's of course on the DS.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.880
Uh, let's see.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880
Nerf and Strike.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.480
Man, it's just fucking bundles of stuff.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.520
The N-Strike Double Blast Bundle.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.240
It's with a gun in the two last Nerf N-Strike games.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.240
That's on the Wii.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:41.280
Cabela's Dangerous Hunts XI with the wireless shotgun, the top shotgun, and that's on Xbox

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.200
360 and the PlayStation 3.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.120
Wii has like a gun shell that goes with it, but same type of thing.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.480
Also the game is available by itself on those three platforms as well.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:56.760
Uh, SBKX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:06.360
Smackdown vs. Raw, 2011 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:17.400
Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PSP, and PC.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:24.000
Pets Cats Playground on the DS, Dora the Explorer, Dora's Cooking Club, that's on the

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
DS.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.840
Sims 3 Late Night Expansion Pack, now you can have your own emo vampires in it.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.840
That's on PC only.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.840
Do they sparkle?

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.440
I think they might.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.400
CSI Fail Conspiracy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.160
Also kind of another game similar to that on the Wii.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160
Buy CSI.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.280
K. Well you know who makes that game right?

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.120
They look terrible though.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120
I'm hurt.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.320
Well they should try harder.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.400
Just kidding.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400
Have you ever played one?

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400
I don't watch CSI.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.400
See if it was law and order.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.400
If it was law and order we'd be talking about it.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.800
Don't worry I got your back.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.800
Thanks Rob.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.640
Tony Hawk Shred coming down on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii, just don't buy it seriously.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.360
It's one of those games that requires a stupid skateboard to play.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.920
You know what that really should be?

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920
Skateboarding outside.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.440
Because if you have to buy a skateboard to play a game you should just skateboard.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:26.440
Done.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.440
Halo, that'd be funny this was Halo, no.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.680
Hasbro Family Game Night, Halo Family Late Night 3.

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.920
It's a Spartan good time.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.920
Frag your friends.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:37.920
Frag grandma.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.200
No Hasbro Family Game Night 3 coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:47.200
Some more games with that.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200
Okay.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.200
And I doubt that this is coming out on this date because why would you release this a

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.200
good week early?

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.200
But who knows?

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.160
Fighters Uncaged, I believe that's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.200
But that's the fighting game for the Kinect.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.680
That's of course on Xbox 360.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.040
Imagine Fashion Stylist, another game that you're probably not interested in, that's

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.080
on DS.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.840
The Sims 3, that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii this week.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.080
DS and PSP as well, I believe.

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:20.800
Deca Sports 3 on the Wii.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.580
And one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto IV, they're releasing a complete edition

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:31.040
with both Grand Theft Auto IV and the episodes of Liberty City, all for $39.99.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.520
The Fights Lights Out on PlayStation 3, that is the move fighting game.

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.840
That's coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.520
Rock Band 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.280
Oh I've heard of that one.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:54.060
Monopoly Streets on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and I believe DS and PSP.

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:58.880
Pets Nursery 2 on DS.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.680
And Lego Universe on PC, that should be pretty big.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.400
Oh that's the MMO, huh?

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.080
That is the awesome MMO.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.920
I haven't even heard a darn thing about that game actually, I'm kind of curious now.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.800
Mama is doing everything, now she's crafting.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.840
What kind of crafting?

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.000
TF2 crafting?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.640
Arts and crafting.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.620
That is on Nintendo DS.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:29.160
But don't worry Wii fans, there will be babysitting in your future.

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.880
Remington's Super Slam Hunting North America on the Wii.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:39.840
ZHP Unlosing Ranger vs. Dark Death Evil Man, that's on PSP, it has an awesome title.

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.000
Blood Drive on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, that's going to be kind of like a Twisted

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.240
Metal type of game, so definitely check that out, I think it could be a sleeper hit.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.040
Imagine Resort Owner, don't even bother.

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.400
Mercury Limited Edition, why I keep re-releasing these games, no one bought them in the first

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.400
place.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.200
That's on PSP.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:10.800
And Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Tag Force 5 on PSP, Fable 3 on Xbox 360, just a little game there.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.920
What's with these tie-ins?

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.800
Mega Bloks, Diego's Build and Rescue, what you couldn't spring for the license for Legos?

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:25.720
Oh and Power Geeks coming out this week, not to be outdone by Rock Band, but it will be

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.980
outdone by Rock Band.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:34.240
That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and it is too damn expensive.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:40.480
Disney Channel All Stars Party on the Wii, Intellivision lives on the Nintendo DS, and

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.040
Chevrolet Camaro on the Wii.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.080
It's lived like every year for the past 10 years in one way or another.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.080
Really guys, still alive?

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.960
Like I like Intellivision at all, but it might be time for it to die.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.000
Alright, is that it?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
That's it.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Alright, moving on.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.400
Oh, I actually want to read some of the comments from chat, chat.ownerswansradio.com.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.840
Salacious Pop is giving us some dialogue that could be used in the Halo Family Party trailer

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.080
actually here at chat.ownerswansradio.com.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.960
Quote, how the hell does grandma keep getting headshots?

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.240
She has Parkinson's.

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.360
I hate this game.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:20.960
Mom, granddad teabagged me and called me that mean word for gays and now everyone on my

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.160
headset is griefing me and laughing.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:27.000
Coming to a store near you, Halo Family Party.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Right, Loki?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.880
I'm surprised they haven't gone there yet.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880
They might.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.880
They might.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.880
We like money, cha-ching.

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:40.400
Alright, moving on to the Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360, Fable 3 gets its Japanese

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:47.960
release on the 28th, Raderji, Noah Massive, yes, Raderji?

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.720
I don't even know what this game is, although I, no, yes I have.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.720
This is a shitty game.

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.720
Raderji's a shmup.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.720
I've never seen this before.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.440
They have a version of it on DS2, I think.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:00.360
So yeah, Raderji is finally coming out on the Xbox, so check that out on the 28th.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:06.560
Also, World Soccer Winning 11 2011 is coming out this week on the Xbox 360 as well.

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.640
Moving on to the Playstation 3 and looking at some of the releases there.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:15.440
Usually they pretty much get ports of the same releases on the Xbox 360, which yes,

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:22.400
World Soccer Winning 11 2011, Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Edition is coming out this week

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.360
in Japan.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:30.860
Also there is a slim console bundle in 160 and 320 gig models that contain the World

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:36.440
Soccer Winning 11 2011 game, Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Edition.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:42.600
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii and the games that are coming out there this week.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.420
Really nothing, sadly.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.940
Nothing on the Wii this week, but that's because they got the Kirby Yarn last week just like

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.080
we did, so the Wii's a little quieter this week.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:55.160
DS is a little different because the 25th anniversary DSi is out this week, so that

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.600
is a pretty big deal.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:02.240
Also, Sola Torobo Sore Karakoda E is coming out this week on the DSi.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.480
There's a regular and a collector's edition.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.720
This is like a DSi enhanced version.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.880
It's from the creators of the.hack series.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:14.120
So it's an action sci-fi fantasy game.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.120
This is awesome.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.480
It's a world ruled by dog people and cat people.

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.200
And you play a hunter.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:24.440
I don't know if you hunt the dog and cat people, but whatever.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.440
Sounds interesting.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.960
Take this, dog people!

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.640
It's Alpo.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.160
It's super effective.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.780
On the Sony PSP, God Eater Burst comes out this week.

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:37.680
That doesn't sound sacrilegious at all.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.720
Also Phantom Brave Portable comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:46.200
I've eaten so much God, I'm just gonna burst now.

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:53.360
Dark Sakura?

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:59.120
In the UK, on the 26th, we have BlazBlue Continuum Shift, Death Spank, which is the best name

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:06.720
ever, Splatterhouse, and The Sims 3, are they just getting the Sims 3 expansion?

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:10.240
On the 27th is Bloody Good Time, which I think is a fantastic name too.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:16.920
On the 28th is Super Scribblenauts, Fable 3, FIFA Manager 11, Football Manager 2011,

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.720
which is real football and not what we call football over here.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.720
My Sims Sky Heroes, Rock Band 3, Sean White's Skateboarding, Star Wars The Forest Unleashed

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:34.400
2, The Lord of the Rings Aragorn's Quest, Tony Hawk's Shred, TV Superstars, we sing

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.240
Robbie Williams, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2011.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.440
And on the 30th, we have Sims 3 Late Night.

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.680
And since we're not having a show next week, I'll go ahead and say on the 31st is Saw 2.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.220
I like Robbie Williams, like I know he's not a big deal here in the US, but he's pretty

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.220
big everywhere else.

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.220
Yeah.

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.480
I can see why he's getting his own karaoke game.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.360
Alright, let's move on to some more news, and then the Classic Game of the Week is just

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.960
a few steps away.

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:04.960
Loki?

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:05.960
Oh yeah.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:11.560
So this is kind of interesting, apparently, and I actually saw this on the news, which

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:17.600
is kind of weird, but there was a lot of, or it was, I guess, brought up by the Wall

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:25.000
Street Journal that there was a bunch of Facebook applications actually transmitting user IDs

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.920
and other information, I guess, to third party advertisers.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:40.560
And of those applications, I guess, some of them were created by Zynga, including FarmVille.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.260
Apparently the three of the top ten applications, FarmVille, had been transmitting personal

01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:49.800
information about users' friends to outside companies.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:54.960
Of course, your user ID is publicly available and is by itself just a number, however this

01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.520
data can be, and as apparently the Wall Street Journal reports, is being shared with other

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:01.520
parties specifically.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.160
Wait, wait a minute.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160
Wait a minute.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:10.240
You mean to tell me that Zynga, the makers of that free FarmVille game and all these

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.920
other free games that they knocked off from other companies, you mean Zynga, the company

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:18.880
that's been called pure evil by many people on the internet?

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.120
They've been raping my privacy this whole time?

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.120
I know.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.120
Who would have thought?

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.240
Well, if you're lying.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:34.960
If I understand it correctly, it wasn't that they're like, hey, here it is, but more of

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.240
being able to access that data from other sites.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:50.120
So the embedded ads and just, it wasn't just like, here you go, please take it.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:56.680
It was just playing those games made that stuff more accessible to be grabbed and they

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.720
took advantage of that.

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:04.680
So wait, Amazon.com might know I'm gay because I've played FarmVille once in my life?

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.640
I bet you have terrible taste in games apparently.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.400
Gosh, it keeps trying to, I wondered why it keeps trying to sell me like Will and Grace

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.720
even season seven and funny girl on Blu-ray.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.360
I just couldn't figure that out.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.860
And because of this whole leak or whatever, of course what's going to happen?

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:29.920
Some lawyers are going to catch wind of this and they're going to file a class action lawsuit.

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.800
And that's what they did.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.800
Apparently-

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.840
Because it's the American way.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:37.600
We're going to sue you about it.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:46.440
Apparently law firm Edelson McGuire filed a suit with San Francisco federal court, I

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.480
guess by St. Paul, Minnesota resident Nancy Graff.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.840
They're seeking monetary relief for those whose data was wrongly shared and injunction

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.080
relief to prevent continued privacy abuses.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.600
And it says no specific amount was mentioned regarding the extent of aforementioned monetary

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.600
relief, but seeing as how the announcement claims the leak has affected 218 million Facebook

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:14.720
users, we're guessing the damages will be significant or sought will be significant.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.440
Not necessarily what they get.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.820
Well, I don't know.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:26.620
I would say that's not too uncharacteristic for that company, but that sucks, I guess

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:31.400
if you're into Farmville, but honestly, you know, with Facebook and stuff, a lot of your

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.880
information is just kind of out there anyways, even if you're, you know, turning on your

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.360
privacy settings and stuff like that.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.400
I just love though how, you know, this couldn't be timed any better because it always seems

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.340
like, you know, that guy, that, that bro that runs Facebook is like a billionaire is always

01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:51.560
getting up on stage going, Hey, you know, guys, we're really working on the privacy

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.600
thing and you know, we want your information to be secure and information and your security

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.280
is our number one priority.

01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.780
And then, you know, it comes out like literally the next day, like Farmville is selling your

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:06.520
information to the devil.

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:09.200
Facebook creator is actually devil.

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.560
All right.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.560
Yeah.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:19.280
So I did, we already went through this debate with a web browser cookies, which is essentially

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.400
what's happening only.

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.600
It's a different avenue.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.160
It's a super cookie.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.320
It's a super cookie, delicious, but I mean, but, but, but it just, it just seems like

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:35.680
all it is is like, okay, we know this is a unique user and yes, attached to Facebook,

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.720
but it's not, I'm not dismissing the issue, just trying to get more clarity on what the

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720
issue is.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:46.140
And it just seems like it's the same thing as the cookie of like, okay, unique user,

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:52.400
but what knocked it up the next level is that this number, which was first just like, okay,

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.100
plant there, this, this number we generate, so it can keep a unique ID.

01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:02.760
This time it's persistent, it's more persistent because it's attached to your Facebook profile

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.460
and et cetera, et cetera.

01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:07.960
And so anything you post on Facebook might be publicly accessible.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.620
So, you know, lesson learned.

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:13.760
If you're going to use a site like Facebook, make sure, you know, if you don't want to

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:19.640
get it out there, don't post it or lock it down or even if you're locked down to private,

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.200
like my Facebook is locked down, so only friends of mine can see it.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.120
And even then there's some things I just don't post on Facebook.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.320
You know, Rob, there is a good use of Facebook.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.800
What's that?

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:34.520
Like umlaut on Facebook.com slash umlaut.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.520
Yes.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.800
Do you have all these, you had all these plugs written down on a sheet of paper.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.800
Wait till we get to Twitter.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.680
It's like you're playing a game.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:47.080
Which is umlaut, at umlaut.

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.360
While we're at it.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.960
All right.

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.000
Anyhow, quickly here, you won't be able to find Rockband on here.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.320
Sorry, umlaut fans, but one thing you will be able to find is a brand new Games for Windows

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.840
Marketplace with lots of new stuff, I guess.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:06.560
November 15th is when the new Games for Windows Marketplace launches, because, you know, right

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.640
now when you think about how can I download PC games on my computer, you usually think

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.080
about, I don't know, Steam is one of the big ones or maybe Direct to Drive or even maybe

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:20.280
that good old game site that may have that big old joke, haha, we're shutting down.

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.280
No, wait, no, we aren't.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.280
I think a few weeks ago.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:25.040
You don't usually think about, oh, yeah, Games for Windows has their own Marketplace.

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:28.200
Well, Microsoft's not happy with that and they'd like to change their perception there,

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.920
so they are going to be beefing up their online portal with some more stuff.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.480
It's all going to be branded with the whole Games for Windows Live, more competitive and

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.480
blah blah blah blah blah.

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:43.440
They want to make it a store, really a destination for PC gamers.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.520
There's going to be stuff enabled through Live, all that good stuff.

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.440
So they're going to be revamping everything on November 15th.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.920
So there you go.

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:56.040
And they're saying you should show up on day one because we're going to have a great pre-order

01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.200
on a title you may care about.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.280
The speculation is that it's Fable 3 for the PC.

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.280
Foreshadowing.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.400
You know what, though?

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.240
If they can match some of those sales that Steam is having, you know what?

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.520
Competition is not necessarily a bad thing because, you know, if they're going to try

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.860
to one-up Steam, they're going to have to do so with some of the prices.

01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:19.040
So we'll see exactly how that goes over.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.200
In the meantime, let's get to a segment we like to do here on the show where Dark Sakura

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:33.000
dips into the video game vault and says, hey, you ungrateful kids with your desert bus events

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.400
and your oomblouds and stuff, you know what, you need to know where these games came from.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.200
Get off my lawn and go play these games.

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:43.200
And while you're at it, yeah, that's right, no, we like to explore Gaming's Past.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.400
Just pull up your pants.

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.400
Buy a belt.

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.400
All right.

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:52.240
We're going to explore Gaming's Past by checking out the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura.

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.960
What is the Classic Game of the Week from the vault this week?

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.360
I'm angry with myself for having never reviewed this one.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.360
Sonic and Knuckles.

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.160
I've done Knuckles Chaotix.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.720
I've done other Sonic games.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:04.160
Have not done Sonic and Knuckles.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.840
What is wrong with me?

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:11.080
So this is something that Sega has done right.

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.560
We have to start off with the noise.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.200
We always have to start off with the noise.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.200
Yes.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:27.720
Best music ever.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.720
Sonic and Knuckles.

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:33.480
They came out on the Genesis, also known as the Mega Drive overseas.

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:39.560
And it was actually developed in the US at the Sega Technical Institute by members of

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.240
Sonic Team.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:47.920
And it came out on October 18th, 1994, which was, guess what, the year I graduated high

01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920
school.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920
Woo!

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.120
You're older than me.

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.560
Bite my butt, Rob.

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.560
I'm vintage.

01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.560
Shut up.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:03.240
Anyway, this was a, uh, you could play it by itself, and it also locked on to Sonic

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.240
2 and Sonic 3.

01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.880
The game was actually developed with Sonic 2 and Sonic 3, so that's why it's got all

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:12.840
the special little nummy goodies in it.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.400
Almost as delicious as these peanut butter cookies.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.840
Once you've got different stories, it actually picks up from the end of Sonic 3, um, after

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.160
the Death Egg crashes.

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.280
Um, oh, just by the way, Rob, I was playing Bayonetta, and I got that they were calling

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:33.480
that dude Eggman, because that was Robotnik's name in the Japanese version was Eggman, anyway.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:39.480
Um, and so you have to go get the Chaos Emeralds and the Super Emeralds and all the stuff and

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.840
be super awesome.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:45.000
And if you get all of them, you get, you turn into Super Sonic.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Yay!

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.920
And you can go to the Doomsday Zone, yay!

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:52.200
And then you can join, blow up the machine, yay!

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:59.600
And return the Master Emerald, which leads right into Sonic Adventure, oooh, because

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.920
the island crashes back down in Sonic Adventure, and Knuckles is pissed off at Sonic.

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.560
Yeah, anyway.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.640
And then you've got Knuckles Story, which everyone just beats up on him, and he's like,

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:13.880
well, crap, I'm tired of getting you, so I'm gonna go get all these emeralds too.

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.880
And that's the Knuckles Story, don't you just love my paraphrasing?

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:24.800
As far as the way it plays, well, you can't use Tails, oops, however, if you lock it on

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:34.520
to Sonic 3, then you can play Tails, I mean, you just lock it on.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:40.000
It's got different bonus stages, you've got ones where you collect 20 rings by walking

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.120
through these bumpers, and then you have the slot machines from Sonic 2, like in the Casino

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:53.680
Night Zone, and there's, of course, the labyrinth type thing.

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.800
And then there's also the magnetic orbs that you can use to move upwards and pick up shields

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.920
and rings and lives and fun stuff.

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:08.320
It does not have a save slot in it, unless you combine it with Sonic 3, to make it Sonic

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.120
3 and Knuckles.

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:17.040
So as far as other stuff in it, again, with Sonic 3, you can use Sonic 3 to play through

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.720
as Knuckles, lots of fun.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.520
In Sonic 2, you can play Knuckles in Sonic 2, and you don't have to have as many rings

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:32.960
for the little bonus zones, and you can also, if I remember right, I think Knuckles has

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:39.000
a lower ring, no, he can carry his rings over to the next stage instead of having to start

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
over.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.640
So, that was a big thing with that, it was much easier to play through it with Knuckles.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.320
God, I'm getting motion sickness just watching this bonus stage.

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:54.560
I know, I hate, I could not do the bonus stages because I would get very motion sick.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:05.200
And speaking of those little bonus stages, if you tried to hook up the Sonic and Knuckles

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.360
to Sonic the Hedgehog, you would get a screen with all the cast going, no way, no way, no

01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.360
way!

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:18.720
However, if you press a series of buttons, you can play the Blue Sphere game, a hundred

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:21.600
different levels of it, and there's actually different levels depending on which game you

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.820
do this with, because you can also do it with a bunch of other games.

01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:30.320
But keep in mind, you will not be able to play Knuckles in, you know, Violent Commando

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.320
or something like that.

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:32.720
That just wouldn't work.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.120
He'd fly everywhere and...

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.640
That would be kind of awesome though.

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.640
That would be kind of awesome.

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.340
Wasn't it, they weren't able to do it in Sonic 1 because Sonic's blue is also coded to like

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:48.320
the sky or something like that, and like, if you, you know, they change the color on

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:54.080
Sonic from blue to red, but then it's BLOOD SKY!

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.200
It's funny that you say that.

01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:01.120
There's talking about hacks, um, there was a game hack called Miles Tails Prower, which

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:08.320
was, you know, Tails' name is Miles Prower, which I thought was always cute, um, and then

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:13.920
they did, um, the same group did one, it was a game basically to put Miles, to put Tails

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:14.920
in Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.960
They also did Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:24.840
So instead of using, um, changing the palettes, because you're right, it did change the sky

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:33.360
color, they actually lifted, um, different colors of red from, um, another part in the

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:39.320
game and changed the socks to blue so that he didn't have to change the palette.

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.520
So that was pretty smart of them.

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:48.040
Another thing, too, about Sonic 2 with Knuckles is that, um, for the longest time, um, because

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:54.320
of that patch that they used to make the games work together, you couldn't find a ROM of,

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:59.040
uh, of Sonic 2 that you could play Knuckles in for the longest time.

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.320
They've since gotten around that.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:10.680
So as far as, um, the releases, what was really great, and I remember this, because I was

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:17.480
like, ah, I want to do this, ah, um, Blockbuster Video and MTV had a tournament at, um, where

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.160
people could play pre-release with the final one being at Alcatraz.

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:27.320
I don't know if anyone else remembers that, but it was, um, called MTV's Rock the Rock

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.320
Warning.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.320
Sadly, I think I do remember that.

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:41.320
Um, it came out on Virtual Console, and it got a 9 from IGN, and it was very cool.

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.200
Alright, your classic game of the week, folks!

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.480
Sonic and Knuckles.

01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.440
I can't do this damn stage at all.

01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.480
Your bonus stages are evil.

01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.280
I prefer, oh, is he finally getting the Chaos Emerald?

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.280
Yes.

01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:56.280
Yay!

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.280
You got a Chaos Emerald.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.280
Alright.

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.320
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.320
Enjoy that.

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.320
It's been a long time in the works.

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.840
Sonic and Knuckles there on the Sega Genesis or the Mega Drive, whichever you prefer.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.200
What a good ending spot, too.

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.120
That was a good ending spot.

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:17.160
Well, that was as good of a transition as Sega has plugs for his Umlaud tonight, so.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:19.600
Which is all available at umlaud.org, by the way.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.600
See what I mean?

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:26.400
Alright, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere,

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.600
because when we come back, there will be plenty more.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.040
We've got a lot, a lot of news to get through.

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:33.760
We're going to ask Sega a little more about charity-related things as well, kind of like

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:35.960
how he started this whole charity thing in the first place.

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:38.520
We want to kind of get into that, especially for those of you out there that might be thinking,

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:43.600
hmm, I want to do a fundraiser, too, and go on radio show podcasts and work in plugs everywhere

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.600
I can.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.600
And be a mild internet celebrity.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:46.600
There you go.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.720
So, on the internet D-list.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:56.280
Not even the celebrity D-list, and then there's the internet D-list.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:04.960
So like, you know, keyboard cat would be like on the B-list, O-L-R, like D-minus.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:06.760
That means we can hang out with Kathy Griffin.

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:09.400
No, she's on the celebrity D-list.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:13.920
We would get to hang out with, let's see, who would be on about the level of O-L-R.

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:19.320
I'm trying to think of like internet celebrities that would be on about our level.

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:27.920
I'm thinking, um, see even people like, even like the kid in David Goes to the Dentist,

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:32.600
that's like, that's like at the B-list or maybe even the A-list of the internet.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:35.160
Could we hang out with a sassy gay friend?

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.220
Sassy gay friends probably up there, too.

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:41.000
Maybe the what, what, and the butt guy, because that's been a few years.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.600
We might be on about that level, because it's been a few years since he was popular, so.

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:46.600
Okay.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:47.600
All right.

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:54.880
Rob, we're probably up there with double rainbow guy, because he's kind of.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:55.880
What does it mean?

01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:56.880
All right.

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:00.520
Anyhow, all joking aside, I wanted to kind of read this real quick, because this is a

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:04.080
comment in our chat room from, and it relates to a story that we had just brought up a minute

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:05.080
ago.

01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:07.880
This is a comment in our chat room from our pal Derek H, who is one of the hosts, or I

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:13.240
should say really the host, because he always has co-hosts with him, on Dead Pixel Live.

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.120
He's there weekdays at All Games Radio, he hosts his own little shindig there.

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.120
It's a lot of fun.

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:25.160
He sends us this link to a story on Slashdot about, is Zynga trying to patent virtual currency?

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.920
Since we were talking about Zynga, and how some of their ethics may be questionable once

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.400
in a while, I thought this was kind of fascinating.

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:37.400
Apparently a recent patent application was spotted by Zynga, attempting to patent virtual

01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:42.800
currency purchased with real money for use in a gambling context.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:47.080
But I'm thinking, and this website's thinking as well, aren't there already plenty of

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:53.720
ways that that exists, like, I don't know, Xbox 360 money, or, I mean, just a lot of

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:55.040
MMOs out there.

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.480
You can buy money.

01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.140
But if they get the patent, then they have the patent, but if they get it denied because

01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:07.160
of prior art or whatever ruling, then they can say, if someone else tries to claim it,

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:14.440
they'll go, oh, no, no, no, no, we did, and the patent office said, oh, it can't be patented.

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.160
So maybe it's a move to protect themselves in the long run?

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:18.160
Yeah.

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.160
What do you think filing all these patents and all this news is for?

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:22.160
Interesting.

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.160
All right.

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.160
Fair enough.

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.160
Fair enough.

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.120
So we'll see what happens with that, because heaven forbid they should be granted the patent.

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.920
But we'll see.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920
All right.

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:33.120
Anyhow, we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:34.120
Don't go anywhere, guys.

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.120
Stay tuned.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:42.800
We'll be back right after this.

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:45.320
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:52.800
We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 24th of 2010, for the 387th episode of

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:54.680
our Lil Podcast here.

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:55.680
OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.080
Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at AllGames.com, where you just heard during

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.840
the break there, if you were listening live, we can't put it on the podcast because it's

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:03.840
copyright music.

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.520
We played some music from DJ Hero 2.

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.900
It kind of had the whole thing going live here in studio, that was pretty awesome.

01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:15.040
Also live in studio tonight, joining us, The Segg is one of the co-founders of UMLOUD,

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.320
but he really hasn't talked a lot about it tonight.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:21.640
And I've been coaxing him like, hey, if you show up to the show, you've got to try and

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:23.600
drop a plug or two for what you're trying to sell.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.760
It's hard to get people to go to umloud.org and read all about our charity.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:28.760
Yes.

01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.760
All right.

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.720
So just try to work in a couple more plugs if you could.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.360
You know, Segg, I just would hate for you to have wasted that tank of gas to get here

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.400
and then just not talk about your charity event.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.200
I know, exactly.

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:43.720
It's really hard trying to get people even to follow our Twitter account, which is at

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.720
UMLOUD.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:45.720
U-M-L-O-U-D.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:46.720
All right.

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.720
Good job.

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.720
All right.

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.720
Let's see.

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:52.160
Quickly, I want to ask you some more questions here since we have you here tonight.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.520
You're so kind to be here live.

01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.720
I know one thing you've also been doing a lot of this year, besides the telltale stuff,

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.500
besides the UMLOUD planning, another thing you've been doing quite a bit is you've been

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.100
doing speaking events.

01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:06.800
And I know you did PAX East because I saw your panel there when I went to PAX East earlier

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:07.800
this year.

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:08.800
And I know you did.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:09.800
Didn't you do a companion piece at PAX West?

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:10.800
Yeah.

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.280
Kind of same song, different verse type of deal.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.800
Same song, different time.

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.800
Yeah.

01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.800
Different audience.

01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:17.720
What was the panel all about that you were doing?

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:26.240
Well, it was trying to communicate, okay, there's a lot of people who obviously give

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:33.200
to Child's Play and there's definitely a lot of people who want to do more.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:42.280
And what I wanted to do with the panels is to establish and get the right general questions

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:47.320
answered for people who want to start their own Child's Play community fundraiser.

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.680
And what that means and just sort of the broad overview of where to get started and to take

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:58.640
that next step of starting your own event, whether it's a local event or an internet

01:56:58.640 --> 01:56:59.640
based event.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:04.840
Obviously, we could probably have you recap everything, but that would take an hour, like

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:05.840
your panel.

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:08.040
So I don't want to recap the whole thing.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:12.800
But just trying to get some of the points out, what would you say for somebody who is

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.280
trying to plan one of these events for themselves?

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.880
And maybe you can speak from experience on this.

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:24.240
What's one thing that people don't anticipate when they say, hey, I want to throw a rock

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.680
band charity event at this, I don't know, the Masonic Lodge or wherever people are doing

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:31.800
things, you know, we want to do like a little charity event.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:35.840
And what do you think is like one of the top things people don't foresee in the planning

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.640
of these events that comes back to surprise them?

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.960
Like oops, we should have thought about X.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:47.720
Well, besides the legal thing, which is a whole other conversation, we'll touch on a

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:58.680
few moments, but the big thing that I stress is set up what I call a list of products,

01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:04.840
if you're doing an event where, okay, these are the things that we're going to have as

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.400
a quote unquote product for the event.

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:11.960
So to take Ooma out, for example, we have this ultimate band package product, we have

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:17.480
this headliner band product, we have the ticket in the door product, we have the raffle ticket

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:18.480
product.

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:23.800
And by listing these down, you go, okay, how do we make this happen?

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:29.320
And that's what's really sort of lost because people don't really know how to take the thing

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:30.320
from soup to nuts.

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:35.560
It may be a great idea, but you're actually at the event and you go, oh crap, how do I

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.560
do this?

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:37.560
Oh crap.

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:41.960
Oh, we have to do all this stuff and then fumble from there.

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:49.000
So it's really take a step back with your team and go, start brainstorming, get all

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.360
the ideas in the world, but then realize that it may be best to put some things off the

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:59.720
table if you can't deliver on them because if you do too much and not account for it,

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:02.040
it's all going to go to shambles.

01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:10.080
It's best to just hold back and make sure you establish yourself and maybe next year

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.360
you'll do that thing that you wanted to do or whatever.

01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:13.360
All right.

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:14.360
Awesome.

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:15.360
Let's see.

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:16.360
I'm trying to think of other things.

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:21.800
Do you think sometimes people maybe think too big when it comes to these things?

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:23.160
I would say, yeah.

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:27.360
And as people who have the best of intentions and I'm not, believe me, I'm not discouraging

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.880
it as someone who did a show in eight weeks.

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:37.840
Well, first of all, for UmLoud, UmLoud wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Fundrauser,

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:43.760
which was an event that was actually founded by Joel Johnson, started in New York and then

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:51.680
grew to Denver with Brian Casante of Kotaku doing the Denver event and then Gizmodo did

01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:59.960
the San Francisco event and I went to that event, showed up and it was at Shine Bar on

01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:06.040
Leet Mission Street in San Francisco, 1337 Mission Street, and it was a 200 capacity

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:13.040
bar and it was just show up with rock band, you know, very simple, but packed the place.

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:17.360
And that established, okay, there is, we can get enough people in here and that was just

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:20.480
with day of advertising.

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:25.920
And I always, I hadn't done charity work for a while and I wanted to get back into the

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:27.680
swing of it.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:35.400
And separately, I always wanted to do an event that incorporated rock band, guitar hero rock

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:39.320
band, but focused on the performance aspect.

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:45.920
And it was just this perfect storm, so I threw my hat in and that's when I first got introduced

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:52.120
to Chris Kohler, who also helped out with the Fundrauser event in 08.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:56.940
And it was also, you know, planning this out, actually throughout the year, but with Joel

02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:05.840
and Joel had a lot of things going on so he can continue on and so we were left with making

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.920
our own event since we already had the deposit reserve for DNA and got things together.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:17.880
And it really, it also, don't do this alone, I think is the other thing.

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:24.280
If you, you know, if you can't get other people to do it, don't break yourself.

02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:29.720
And I'm not trying to discourage people, I'm not trying to knock them down.

02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:33.400
Even if you're a big control freak like me and like you just, you want to do everything,

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:36.200
like you just have to let some of it go because it's too much for one person.

02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:41.760
It goes down to if you can't get people to help you quite yet in working the event, how

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.320
are you going to get people there?

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.000
That's a fair question.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.820
You know, it's a fair question.

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:53.360
I would say be realistic, but don't that outright discourage you.

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.360
Right.

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.920
Don't let any of this scare you off from trying to do something like that.

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.040
I think that's important too.

02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:01.720
Like we're just, we're just trying to be real here on OLR and say, you know, if you're ready

02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:07.080
to take this dive, by all means dive, but here's some floaties, some tips so that you

02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:08.080
don't drown.

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:11.680
So let me get you a question from our chat room if I could here at chat.orangetonstrategy.com.

02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:15.920
Salacious Pop is in chat and wants to know, Segg, how long did it take to get incorporated

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:22.320
as a nonprofit so that people could legally write off donations to you in their taxes?

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.320
Are the fees steep?

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.400
Did you have to do it through an attorney to protect your own name and assets?

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:36.880
I have the benefit of a wonderful father who does this pretty professionally.

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:43.560
I say that just like he doesn't actually have it as a job job, but he, we, as I, as I alluded

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.880
to the sort of the family business that wasn't really a business was charity events back

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:59.240
home in Detroit, Dearborn, and like we did Detroit Children's Hospital Festival of Trees

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:01.800
and our high school auction and all that.

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:08.360
So he already knows how to, you know, the tax end of things.

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:13.320
The state of California was definitely new to us and, oh, the state of California was

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:22.360
definitely new to us for those filings, but it's sort of a level thing.

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:28.440
We were, the official birth date as far as the IRS and the state of California's concern

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:37.200
for UMLoud is November 17th, and that was when the California you are a business that

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.240
happens to be nonprofit was first minted, which is pretty quick.

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:47.720
But then for all the stuff you want to do, like donation buttons, either PayPal or Google

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:53.480
checkout and all that, yes, you know, and we got the TIN very easily, the tax ID number

02:03:53.480 --> 02:04:01.100
for UMLoud, but then you have all this other stuff that has to go through, like it takes

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:07.160
a while for the IRS to process the paperwork and you have to fill out the longer form and

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.160
all this.

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.960
So really things did not get settled, settled, settled as far as establishing and getting

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:22.200
our determination letter from the IRS till like February, but it's sort of the, yes,

02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:26.680
you were okay as long as you fill out your paperwork, but as of November 17th for us,

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:27.680
we were still in the clear.

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.680
You mean the government is slow in processing paperwork, you don't say.

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:36.000
Well, the IRS even outwardly says, yes, we're going to take a while and you are okay to

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.920
work as a nonprofit, but put your paperwork in and know that, you know, we could revoke

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.640
the status because something didn't clear, which they didn't, you know, we had our, everything

02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.160
was up to snuff.

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:50.880
Just to back you up in our chat room, Defective Candy is in our chat at chat.ornsontradi.com

02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.220
and says, from experience, the state of Michigan is way easier to do the nonprofit than a place

02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:56.220
like Cali.

02:04:56.220 --> 02:05:03.520
Yeah, California actually, from what I've been told by others, is the most complicated

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.520
in the union.

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:09.760
I should also state that every state has a different way completely.

02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:16.960
I mean, the IRS is obviously consistent within the U.S., outside of the U.S., I don't know.

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:17.960
Sorry.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:18.960
Go ahead.

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:19.960
Oh, okay.

02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:24.560
But, you know, that's, when I do these panels, I guide people to the general questions that

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:31.560
they have to ask themselves, which is basically start by googling up your, whatever entity

02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:38.240
in your state does business entities, secretary of state usually, but not always, sometimes

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:41.800
they have a separate department and all that, and that will start you down on the road of

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:42.800
what you need to do.

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:44.440
But don't let all this stuff freak you out either.

02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:49.800
Now, I should also say that, like, there's sort of two general avenues of, at least for

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:52.200
child's play, community fundraisers.

02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:57.760
There's the actual local physical event, which is what we do, and then there's the internet-based

02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:58.760
fundraisers.

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:03.840
Now, the internet-based ones, they haven't made, as long as they're not stupid, and that,

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:10.920
because, like, for example, Desert Bus, which is the online telethon for them, they point,

02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:17.320
they use chip-in to point directly to the child's play PayPal account, meaning they

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:20.760
never touch the money, ever, period.

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:26.120
The chip-in tracks the metrics of how much people clicking on their button went to child's

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:31.600
play, but they never touch the money, so they don't have to do any of this.

02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:35.680
We touch the money at UMA because we have to, you know, pay for the venue, and we're

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:42.640
taking in donations ourselves in this physical event, so we have to go through the process.

02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:50.760
The big numbers, at least for the IRS, at the IRS level, is if you get more than $250

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:58.960
from any one individual, or your total take is $5,000, you need a file, you know, you've

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:02.560
graduated up to, nope, you need to do it for reals.

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:05.840
There's a great follow-up from Defective Candy here in our chat room saying, there are some

02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:06.880
great books on the matter.

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:11.320
I like Nolo's How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation, and all states have info on how to do them

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:12.920
on their official website.

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:14.960
You might have to do a tiny bit of digging.

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:17.200
Let me throw this out there, too, one more kind of little thing here, because I know

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:18.880
this is one of the things I took away from the panel.

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.320
I was like, oh yeah, that's something I might not think about otherwise.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:28.800
But say, if somebody wants to do a child's play fundraiser, you know, before just throwing

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:32.320
the name out there like, hey, we're going to do this child's play fundraiser, there's

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.840
probably people they should be getting in touch with, right?

02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:40.760
Yeah, the, Kristin Lindsey is, I'm sorry, Kristin, I'm totally forgetting your new title

02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:45.680
position, the official title, but she's the woman in charge of child's play.

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.560
We won't call her goddess of child's play.

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.280
Yeah, goddess of child's play.

02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:52.280
She has an official title, and I apologize for that.

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:54.560
It's okay, it's live radio, you're on the spot.

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:59.680
But it's sort of, child's play's not going to give you too much help, because let's face

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:02.040
it, it's a...

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.040
They're not going to run the event for you.

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.280
They're not going to run the event for you.

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:09.860
It's good to check in with her, you know, and sending an email to her saying, hey, we're

02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:18.920
doing this event, and she'll give some help, but you have to understand that everyone else

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:25.720
is doing all this stuff, especially around this time when the season's ramping up again.

02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:29.840
And the process of giving them money is, if you're doing the chip-in thing, the internet-based

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.960
thing, well, you don't have to do anything, it's already into their PayPal account.

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:40.500
But for us, it's, we mail a checkout made out to child's play charity, and mail it in

02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:47.340
to the mailing address that's on the child's play website, and there's that.

02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:50.600
But it's just good, and it's one of those things that you might think is obvious, but

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:54.400
I don't think everyone really thinks of this, is that if you're going to do a charity fundraiser,

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:56.720
go ahead and contact the charity.

02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:57.720
They like to know these things.

02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:58.720
Yeah.

02:08:58.720 --> 02:08:59.720
Yeah.

02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:03.920
And you never know, you might get a plug on the website or something, or a tips at least,

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.120
things maybe you haven't thought of before, so, you know, things that other people have

02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:09.120
learned.

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.120
So, all right.

02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:14.840
Well, I don't want to spend too much more time talking about that, I don't want to ruin

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:20.660
your possible panels in 2011, so I don't know if you're going to be doing it all over again,

02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:24.800
but it was, at least when I went and saw it at PAX East, I certainly learned a lot.

02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:28.240
I know we've kind of dabbled in the idea of maybe doing an OLR charity something something

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:31.720
at some point, so it was interesting to hear all that, so good deal.

02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:35.280
All right, well anyway, we're going to move on with some gaming news, and Seg of course

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.040
is going to stay with us here to talk a little more about the gaming news and Dish with us

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:41.040
this week.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.760
We'll first do some rapid news, then we're going to get into the Twitter topics, so quick,

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:46.440
some rapid, rapid news, Loki.

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:50.680
Yes, Interplay has announced that Fallout Online will be coming out in the second half

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:56.960
of 2012, and it's interesting, there's been a little bit of back and forth between Interplay

02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.760
and Bethesda over the rights for Fallout and stuff, and I believe at one point Interplay

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:07.080
was demanding $50 million for Fallout, and apparently Bethesda said no.

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:13.920
So it'll be interesting to see, and I'm sure that a Fallout MMO will be pretty interesting,

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:18.360
but we'll have to wait a couple years for that.

02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.040
The ESRB is rated Twisted Metal for the PlayStation 1 classics, so obviously they'll be coming

02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.220
around pretty soon, maybe they'll tie in a little bit with the new Twisted Metal game

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:34.080
maybe coming out next year, so we'll have to wait for that one, but at least you can

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:35.560
expect that.

02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:40.360
And then a racing game that is on the PlayStation 3 right now, ModNation Racers, is going to

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:48.120
be getting a Stunt Pack free, I guess it's going to have some cool ramps and whatnot.

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:54.520
The Stunt Pack will include a double-decker bus, an interactive truck, an interactive

02:10:54.520 --> 02:11:02.000
truck trailer mini-ramp, as well as some wide stunt ramps, thin stunt ramps, thin rails,

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.200
tilling platform, framing, skull ring, all sorts of cool stuff.

02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:10.480
And that is free for two weeks, that's beginning October 26th, so if you do have that game,

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:14.600
or if you're thinking about picking up that game, you might want to download that.

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.600
Hurry hurry!

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:21.440
Alright, I've got some quick stuff for you guys too, one of them is about Xbox Live.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:27.680
The Xbox Live Silver account is no more, it is gone, it is out of here, but don't worry,

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.820
you didn't all get suddenly upgraded to gold, actually I don't think that's something anyone

02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:31.820
would worry about.

02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:34.640
No, here's what really happened, the Xbox Live Silver memberships are now just called

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.120
Xbox Live Free Membership.

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:38.120
It is what it is.

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.640
Yeah, finally.

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:40.640
So there it is.

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:46.240
And that is launched right along with the Xbox.com remake that went live this week,

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:49.720
so they just basically say it's free.

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:54.400
They're saying the features did not change, the name for the paid membership did not change,

02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.240
just this little component of it.

02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:57.240
Just so you know.

02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.240
It's easier branding.

02:11:58.240 --> 02:11:59.240
I think so.

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.240
Yeah.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:05.920
Plus, I think especially when one of PlayStation's big things is selling like the free PlayStation

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:07.760
network, I think for them to be able to say...

02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.760
Not quite anymore, but...

02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:09.760
Yeah, exactly.

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.880
You know, now they're kind of on par there, so it works out.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.560
Tron Evolution is getting some voice acting from the movie, which is pretty cool.

02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:22.620
Olivia Wilde, who plays Korra in the upcoming Tron Legacy movie, is going to be doing some

02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:24.360
voices in Tron Evolution.

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:25.360
That's pretty cool.

02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:29.400
Also, the voice of the original Tron character, Bruce Boxleitner, is going to be in there,

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.760
so that's pretty awesome.

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.840
From the scarecrow, Mrs. King.

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:38.040
Sadly, not all of the actors are in there, like I don't see that, what's his name, Garrett,

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:41.080
whatever that's playing the main character, and Jeff Bridges I don't see in the list,

02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:44.000
but just about everybody else seems to be in there, which is pretty cool.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Jensen Ackles.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.280
That makes me personally happy, because I have a major, major, major thing.

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.920
And seeing as I believe I heard the game is kind of set in between the two movies, they

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:59.600
probably did something with the story where they didn't necessarily need the A-list actors.

02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.320
NBA Jam, as we've talked about for a couple weeks on this show, is getting spun off into

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:08.400
its PS3 and 360 retail releases.

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:15.760
The game is going to be $49.99, and it's coming out November 17th.

02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:21.360
Also, it should be noted that it is going to be online and all that, but not on the

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.440
Wii.

02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:23.600
That version is already out.

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:27.440
Online will be available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:29.400
There's going to be two-on-two online.

02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:34.160
There's going to be a title update in December that will have a remix jam party for up to

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:40.080
four players and all sorts of that fun stuff, so $49.99 if you want to check out NBA Jam

02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.240
on the 360 or the PS3.

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:44.360
He's on fire!

02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:45.360
Boom shakalaka!

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.760
Boom shakalaka!

02:13:47.760 --> 02:14:04.400
In other news, for fans who really like the music in Castlevania Symphony of the Night...
