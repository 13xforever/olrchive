00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:24,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, October 10th, 2010, DC Universe Online faces a delay, OnLive gets cheaper to use, and another classic arcade game is set for revival on this gen's consoles.

2
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:37,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:44,288
[SPEAKER_07]: We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

5
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:45,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't forget the episode number.

6
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,189
[SPEAKER_07]: www.allgames.com.

7
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I always forget the episode number.

8
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It's episode 385 for those that are still counting.

9
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:57,952
[SPEAKER_07]: The smart ass you hear over there in the corner is my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:58,752 --> 00:00:59,092
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

11
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:01,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm inhaling bacon fumes and it's not kosher.

12
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,044
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder because there used to be a guy when I was working at Roundtable that would order a quadruple sausage pizza.

14
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:35,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It literally is like a three-quarter inch thick layer of sausage that's just on top of the pizza.

15
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,647
[SPEAKER_07]: For those who don't know, Roundtable is a big pizza chain.

16
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,507
[SPEAKER_07]: On the West Coast, yeah.

17
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,167
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole West Coast or just California?

18
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:41,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly California.

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make it work if you did extra cheese, triple bacon.

20
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:45,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.

21
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:52,535
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem was it was too greasy and actually the point is actually you couldn't really taste the pizza with the bacon.

22
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:59,523
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually really sweet because the sauce is really sweet, but it might be able to work with like two and a half times bacon.

23
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It would work if it was on a rack.

24
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:06,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember there was an episode probably about two years ago, maybe a year ago, where you brought all these bacon dishes to the show?

25
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:07,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

26
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:09,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I never thought in my life that I would ever say this is too much bacon.

27
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,571
[SPEAKER_03]: The bacon scallops.

28
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,712
[SPEAKER_07]: That was last year.

29
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,632
[SPEAKER_07]: That was too much bacon.

30
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:13,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it last year?

31
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:14,834
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my birthday last year.

32
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:15,854
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually really good.

33
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of bacon.

34
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was so much bacon left over.

35
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there was.

36
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys left it at my house?

37
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I would probably do just like a meat party instead.

38
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:32,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Because seriously, bacon, even cooking it the entire day, it's not very good.

39
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, steak party, that's good.

40
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:39,797
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a game that they should sell on the shelves of Target right between Blind Date and Mall Madness.

41
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:40,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Meat party!

42
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:42,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That totally could not be here.

43
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:44,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I only eat meat once a month.

44
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it'll have to be on that day.

45
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:47,713
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

46
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:48,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

47
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:49,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

48
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:51,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed you guys last week.

49
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,435
[SPEAKER_07]: My aim is still improving ever so much, though.

50
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:55,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we did fine without you, Rob.

51
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:56,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just go home if you want.

52
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:56,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, bye.

53
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:57,296
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

54
00:02:57,817 --> 00:03:03,639
[SPEAKER_07]: No, well, actually, I turned on the show while I was at the airport just to make sure that you guys, like...

55
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:04,700
[SPEAKER_07]: We're alive.

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he didn't trust us.

57
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:08,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you never had done it before.

58
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:10,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make sure you didn't get into a train wreck.

59
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:10,804
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

60
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you guys, I heard like five seconds of the show.

61
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys were on the phone with Aki Ripper.

62
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:16,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, oh, okay.

63
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,389
[SPEAKER_07]: They're already into calls.

64
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, everything fell apart.

65
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:20,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it really?

66
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We kept losing the stream.

67
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:23,954
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because I tuned in.

68
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did I miss on last week's show?

69
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not heard it yet.

70
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And I apologize to the podcastees.

71
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, by the time they hear this, they'll be okay.

72
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,161
[SPEAKER_03]: You missed Tiara.

73
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've talked to Tiara before.

74
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I know she's a fun gal.

75
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:37,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy her.

76
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:39,384
[SPEAKER_03]: But you missed her fun hosting capabilities.

77
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:42,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Did she do the Rob role where she kept you all in check?

78
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Made sure you were following the show role?

79
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:45,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Did she?

80
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:49,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

81
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:50,289
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

82
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Some.

83
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:51,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

84
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that show was awesome.

85
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,391
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

86
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I skipped a story once.

87
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:56,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went back and did it.

88
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:06,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well I'm glad to hear things were good and that means I can take vacations more often It's better than the last time we tried to run the show without you Wasn't that the show where you ended up watching like a porno?

89
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:20,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Good times, good times Well I went to Disneyland last week as you guys know and I had a good time Bitch Yeah, I'm fresh out of Space Mountain Bitch But DarkSakura and I are still trying to get the December 17th thing to work

90
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:23,923
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to just cross the T's and dot the I's and all that stuff.

91
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an annual pass again, so going back won't be a problem for me.

92
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:34,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw some of the pictures from Electronica, which started this week, and they actually have a whole little Flynn's Arcade with like 80s old school video games.

93
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:34,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We're there.

94
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's going to be fun.

95
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:36,708
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going.

96
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:37,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

97
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

98
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,509
[SPEAKER_03]: No one can stop us.

99
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:40,650
[SPEAKER_03]: No one.

100
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:43,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Except maybe the bank.

101
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Smite!

102
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:45,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the bank.

103
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:46,753
[SPEAKER_07]: The bank could stop us.

104
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:47,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Smite.

105
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:49,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start off the show.

106
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we've talked about food, we've talked about Disneyland.

107
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else we talk about on this show?

108
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:55,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, video games.

109
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:56,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Once in a while we talk about video games.

110
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:58,099
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Rainbow Fighting Universe?

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,282
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, someone... I was at Outback last night for my one steak a month.

112
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Quit, I quit.

113
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going back to Disneyland.

114
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,508
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite joke to do is when someone says, do you need anything else or want anything else?

115
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, yeah, like a pony, please.

116
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, oh.

117
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And the girl said, my friend Jamie always asks for a unicorn that poops rainbows.

118
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, my name is Jamie.

119
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, oh, wow.

120
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,060
[SPEAKER_08]: My answer would be, how would you like that cooked?

121
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you had to be there.

122
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sleep deprived.

123
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob brought me caffeine unprompted.

124
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because I know it puts you in a good mood and I don't want to have to deal with bitch Jamie all night.

125
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, love hearts.

126
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

127
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

128
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:48,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I see some folks in chat complaining that the podcast is not yet uploaded from last week and I swear...

129
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:52,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not doing it out of spite.

130
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,183
[SPEAKER_07]: No, here's the deal.

131
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:54,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I got super sick.

132
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:56,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob got super hungover.

133
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed a day at Disneyland due to being sick.

134
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I made Alan go to the park without me on Sunday.

135
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:07,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought I was getting better come Monday, but then Tuesday, the day I was supposed to come over and get all the show stuff taken care of, I had the worst fever.

136
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to call in sick to work.

137
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:11,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a big deal for me to call in sick to work because I really don't.

138
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:12,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob has amazing work ethic.

139
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:15,509
[SPEAKER_08]: He did that fantastic crib place across the street from Disneyland.

140
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we did eat at Tony Roma's.

141
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we did eat there, actually.

142
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:22,699
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

143
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen him in forever.

144
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:24,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

145
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,403
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

146
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:26,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

147
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Stark's House of Ribs.

148
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm just reading the chat and a salacious pop is just going, wow, I was mean to Jamie, I didn't mean it, come on you guys, I have to razz around the show, I got last week to make up for, come on you guys And your mic sucks, that is not a lie You went to the place without me

00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:53,904
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to play Final Fantasy XIII and didn't.

151
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:22,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's been in there with our friend George over here playing Halo Reach all day.

152
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:34,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played Star Trek Online and I'm doing... I've got actually until tomorrow to finish the other three missions and this whole Breen thing so that I can get my free Breen tactical officer.

153
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:38,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have a shit ton of homework to do the rest of the week.

154
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So, busy Jamie is busy.

155
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I played lots of Plants vs. Zombies I played Narbacular Drop which we know what that is, right?

156
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,478
[SPEAKER_03]: The precursor to Portal.

157
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,540
[SPEAKER_03]: The game that eventually became Portal.

158
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not any good at it.

159
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a neat concept.

160
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,726
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm glad that Portal made it less clippy, if you know what I mean.

161
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:08,967
[SPEAKER_03]: With fewer trolls in it.

162
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, what else did I play?

163
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

164
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:18,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's played a whole lot of Mega Man.

165
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Mega Man 4 Game Boy Edition

166
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:04,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Mega Man collection on GameCube is still an awesome game to have.

167
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know those GameCubes, you can still play them on the Wii.

168
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's still a good collection to have.

169
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the PS2, whatever one you want.

170
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:14,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people don't like the GameCube one because they think the buttons are swapped or something.

171
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:16,352
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's fine.

172
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't bother me.

173
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:17,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, it's fine.

174
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not bothered, Rob.

175
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:19,994
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

176
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been keeping Super Metroid all warm and cozy for you.

177
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:26,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the long stick

178
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:44,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my.

179
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

180
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:48,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it was okay.

181
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:49,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play a whole lot.

182
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I played mainly Grand Theft Auto.

183
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,500
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, more Grand Theft Auto 4, Lost and Damned.

184
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Still playing more multiplayer.

185
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I am really pissing off my coworkers because I keep winning a lot.

186
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:11,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've actually had to draft up a printed out form letter for apologies for beating them at certain things that I fill out.

187
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:12,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um...

188
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:17,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that adds insult to injury or what, but it's what they requested.

189
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:19,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry that you suck.

190
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:24,347
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like you had to make your amends to your coworkers.

191
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:28,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because, okay, the game is so laggy now.

192
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:36,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they shut down some servers or something when they moved on to a new expansion and Red Dead Redemption, that kind of stuff.

193
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:42,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So the game gets a little laggy sometimes, and sometimes things just seem to go my way.

194
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:43,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, um...

195
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:51,040
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll be coming to attack me and all of a sudden a car hits them and they get knocked over and I turn around and shoot them in the face.

196
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:59,785
[SPEAKER_08]: My big thing now that I've become fascinated with is climbing up buildings.

197
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:04,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm totally this massive free runner in that damn game now.

198
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:05,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.

199
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:07,989
[SPEAKER_08]: How the fuck did you get on top of that skyscraper?

200
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:08,890
[SPEAKER_07]: You're Spider-Man.

201
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I'm like Spider-Man in that game.

202
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:12,112
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.

203
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:24,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of places, especially in Algonquin, that you can just climb up to the top of buildings and there's so many fire escapes you can get to and it's ridiculous.

204
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So you had to write your co-workers apology letters?

205
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:29,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Were they at the point where, we're not playing with you again because you're a jerk?

206
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,729
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting pretty pissed off at me.

207
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:32,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like...

208
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:32,689
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

209
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,051
[SPEAKER_07]: She's walking on sunshine.

210
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:55,757
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

211
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:23,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that I repeatedly beat your ass at Grand Theft Auto and I'm sorry you can't handle it.

212
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry you suck.

213
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:50,198
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not necessarily... It's only when really ridiculous things happen that shouldn't happen normally in the circumstances of the game.

214
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:51,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

215
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

216
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:57,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Other things I played other than Grand Theft Auto, I did play a little bit of Dead Rising 2.

217
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do mean a little bit.

218
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I only got to the part where...

219
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

220
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:22,834
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

221
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:44,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I am digging, though, this one app on there called the Free App Tracker.

222
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:49,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll basically track or let you know when apps drop in price to free.

223
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:57,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go on there and browse through there and download games that would normally cost you money because they're either trying to promote them or whatever.

224
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:58,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

225
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,640
[SPEAKER_08]: A great way to get a bunch of free shit.

226
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,861
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that's pretty much what I've been playing.

227
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:16,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited I get a new laptop this week that I'll actually be able to run Grand Theft Auto on it so I can do my editing at work because that's really the only time I'll actually have to do mods for the Xbox 360 version.

228
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:18,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus I can run other things on there.

229
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:23,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm possibly going to download Minecraft now since everybody keeps talking about it and I got to see what this thing is.

230
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:28,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow missed the boat on all this Minecraft stuff because it's just really happened in the past couple weeks.

231
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:31,095
[SPEAKER_07]: But why is everybody all gung-ho about Minecraft?

232
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:34,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow missed this while I was on vacation.

233
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:37,360
[SPEAKER_08]: It went free for a while while they were fixing some server issues or something.

234
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And once people started playing, they're like, oh my god, it's addictive.

235
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:43,646
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a game you go in and you create stuff.

236
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:45,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's monsters.

237
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,208
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of games like that, isn't there?

238
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, but this is really addicting, apparently.

239
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:50,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll have to try it.

240
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, don't knock until you try it.

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,112
[SPEAKER_08]: To the point where, like, there's someone, like, recreating the Star Trek Enterprise full scale in the game.

242
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:57,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

243
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like Lego is but a game.

244
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:01,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like that.

245
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:03,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Lego Universe, but not.

246
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:04,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

247
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,415
[SPEAKER_03]: We've created a new game in the chat.

248
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:07,555
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

249
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:55,776
[SPEAKER_07]: and like wow people really do buy those but you know what actually um I can relate this to Disneyland a little bit um you know I do the pin trading at Disneyland and I always buy like a generic pin set to trade away to people uh to because the employees trade with you and it's this whole little like weird game you play while you're at the parks so I bought a pack of starter pins you know what the pack was that I bought of starter pins Club Penguin and

250
00:15:55,916 --> 00:16:24,451
[SPEAKER_07]: and like almost all day long people kept asking me like what are those pins what is it and I'm having to like explain Club Penguin to people which is weird because I've never played it but it's one of those like Disney style Farmville-esque MMOs and they sell those cards right next to the Farmville cards at the store but it's more for kids because it's Disney so yeah people actually buy that stuff but I mean the kids stuff I get because the kids stuff you really have to ration I get that a little more but the adult stuff it's like oh boy

251
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:27,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy Um

252
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:31,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so again, if you want to join us in chat, chat.orangelandrita.com.

253
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to mention about your gaming week, Loki?

254
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:34,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you all done?

255
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,370
[SPEAKER_07]: You all done?

256
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:35,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

257
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:36,271
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

258
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:39,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I have a whole lot for my gaming week.

259
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:39,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to be honest.

260
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:43,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I was out for five days and then I was sick, I didn't do a whole lot of gaming.

261
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:43,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a lot of sleeping.

262
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play some more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm a big old... Yeah, shut up.

263
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, my guild is nine of 12 now in ICC, finally.

264
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:52,566
[SPEAKER_07]: We're almost there.

265
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:53,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a Borg designation.

266
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:54,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't it?

267
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:56,770
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

268
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:11,587
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

269
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:12,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Your what thing?

270
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:13,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Breen.

271
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:13,969
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

272
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,510
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a race in Star Trek.

273
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:19,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, is this like a thing you have to grind a lot to get to play them?

274
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:20,634
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

275
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:31,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell everyone right now who's playing Star Trek Online, they're having a special that if you do the Breen episodes, there's five of them, when you finish the last episode, you get a Breen tactical officer.

276
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Only until the 14th.

277
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:34,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

278
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I'm doing.

279
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:36,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Only I've got tomorrow to finish it.

280
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:37,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Random.

281
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:37,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Random.

282
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but now I don't feel so bad about my brain.

283
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:41,567
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

284
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: There's holiday events in WoW that are just as bad.

285
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's mostly been that because I was away for five days and then I was sick and everything, so I haven't been playing a whole lot.

286
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:54,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, I spent a lot more at Disneyland than I should have, so I've been scaling back in other ways.

287
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:59,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to get the Castlevania game this week, but I've heard mixed things on it anyway.

288
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:00,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard it's not so hot.

289
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,040
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the general reaction I've been seeing on Facebook.

290
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,446
[SPEAKER_07]: and I actually resisted buying Final Fantasy XIV which has been getting some really mixed reviews online.

291
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:10,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen this?

292
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:13,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some websites, like I think GameSpot gave it a four.

293
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Like...

294
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:17,942
[SPEAKER_07]: But some websites have been giving it like eights.

295
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:20,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really hit and miss, Final Fantasy XIV.

296
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:21,944
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

297
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:25,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I will talk a little bit briefly then.

298
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:30,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the games I was able to play since I was at the airport and stuff, I did play quite a few iPhone games.

299
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So just really quick, I know not everyone's into this, but I'll mention a couple things I played that came out.

300
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Stardunk is totally free.

301
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,189
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this basketball-y kind of game, but not really.

302
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:42,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want you to think it's like an NBA-type game, because it's not.

303
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like...

304
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:47,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me a little more of those old school tank shooting games.

305
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:50,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you kind of use your finger to pick an angle and a power.

306
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you just try to fire a ball in the basket as many times as you can.

307
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,080
[SPEAKER_07]: But the ball keeps moving around the screen.

308
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:59,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like online and all this Uber stuff with it.

309
00:18:59,263 --> 00:18:59,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty cool.

310
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:01,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Bit Trip Beat came out on the iPhone.

311
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:02,725
[SPEAKER_07]: This game will set you back $5.

312
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:08,550
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little much, I think, considering there are so many games out there that are $0.99 and free.

313
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about this last week because I actually played it last week.

314
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:11,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you?

315
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:11,752
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think?

316
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:12,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I dislike...

317
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I never really cared for the Wii controls.

318
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:20,720
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how you had to tilt the remote to get your little paddle to go back and forth?

319
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really don't like it on the iPod or iPhone.

320
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:30,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather use my finger to move it up and down because that would be a lot more accurate.

321
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,192
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can't, and it's annoying.

322
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:35,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the tilt thing was fine for me.

323
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:36,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoyed it.

324
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:44,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think it's a good game, and it's weird that I'll pay $10 on it on the Wii, but then I sit here and go, but $5 on the iPhone is too much.

325
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:51,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we just get accustomed to these different pricing things when there's so many games out on the iPhone that are free or $3 or less.

326
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:55,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Your game has to be really good to justify a $5 or even $10 premium.

327
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,524
[SPEAKER_07]: With Sonic 4, they want $9.99 for that, right?

328
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:57,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

329
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:02,994
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I am not paying that much.

330
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:05,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But would you pay $15 for it on the PS3?

331
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:05,896
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wouldn't.

332
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

333
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:08,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't.

334
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is that, Loki?

335
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:11,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is that?

336
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

337
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've played it, and it's terrible.

338
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:15,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

339
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:16,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do not like it.

340
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:17,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it at E3 enough.

341
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fine.

342
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:18,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing, though.

343
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:23,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a real big fan of Sonic games, so maybe that's not for me to judge.

344
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:30,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I think games like Sonic Colors or the good parts of Sonic Unleashed actually seem more interesting to me.

345
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:32,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Weird.

346
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:32,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Weird.

347
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:58,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know we'll get into stuff later.

348
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:02,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if the story... Yeah, there's some Sonic 4 stuff on the show later.

349
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's ridiculous.

350
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:05,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

351
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:06,754
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get there when we get there.

352
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:07,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

353
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think it's interesting, though, that it came out on the iPhone first.

354
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:15,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you guys have heard Sonic 4 is out on the iPhone now, and it's not out on consoles until this week, right?

355
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:19,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably buy it on consoles anyway, just because I'm a consumer whore.

356
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

357
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And how, exactly.

358
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:25,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you like the old school Sonic games, then you'll probably like it.

359
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't care for the old... I like Sonic 1, that was alright.

360
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:34,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sonic & Knuckles was kind of fun, but... I don't know, I just don't like Sonic too much.

361
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:39,014
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dreamcast one recently came out on the 360 as well, and I did play that a little bit a couple weeks ago.

362
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:40,915
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently that was a terrible port as well.

363
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:41,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

364
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:43,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I know, I take that back.

365
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,396
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't terrible.

366
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't the same game to me at all.

367
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not the same game to me at all.

368
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like, people are complaining about, like, graphics and stuff in there.

369
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:52,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, it's a Dreamcast game.

370
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:53,858
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you expect?

371
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

372
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:07,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're taking a game that you remember from your tiny TV in your bedroom that was hooked up with the RCA red, yellow, white cables or maybe even, like, the RF adapters.

373
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, minimal graphical ability for this day and age.

374
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're putting it on your HDTV.

375
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:18,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, every flaw you're gonna see now and every rough polygon that was smooth before because the old TVs weren't

376
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,545
[SPEAKER_07]: as Crisp.

377
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And your expectations back then were way lower.

378
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:29,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when the Nintendo 64 stuff came out and hell, even before that, you know, just even some of the

379
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,166
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

380
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

381
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:20,299
[SPEAKER_08]: What Capcom's planning on doing with the iPhone stuff, they're planning on doing something like Game Room, but with the Capcom games.

382
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:20,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

383
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,622
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Quiz and Dragons is in there, I'm game.

384
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:24,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

385
00:23:24,322 --> 00:23:26,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Quiz and Dragons was awesome.

386
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:30,006
[SPEAKER_07]: It ran on the same hardware as, it was either CPS 1 or 2, I can't remember.

387
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,287
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the one that Street Fighter 2's on?

388
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter 2 is CPS 2.

389
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Quiz and Dragons was on that.

390
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Magic Sword, Final Fight, they were all on that same engine.

391
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:40,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Quiz and Dragons was awesome.

392
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

393
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:41,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Look it up.

394
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:42,594
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

395
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:46,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I think I need to bribe DarkSakura to make that a classic game of the week at some point.

396
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

397
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:47,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

398
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Quiz and Dragons.

399
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I never played it.

400
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:50,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

401
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:50,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

402
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:51,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neat.

403
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,478
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in one of those Capcom collections.

404
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:56,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard now because all the trivia questions are like from 92.

405
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is president now?

406
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, no.

407
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Clinton.

408
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:02,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?

409
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:03,641
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

410
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:04,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

411
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:08,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into some actual news.

412
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,527
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing, DarkSakura?

413
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at Minecraft.

414
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:13,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks irritating.

415
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:17,123
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like an old school Doom, make your own Doom type of thing.

416
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:24,207
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that right there is what I imagine ZZT would look like if they did it nowadays.

417
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, now you just sold me this.

418
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this like ZZT?

419
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this like a new ZZT?

420
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:34,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You basically can dig and you can harvest stuff and you can create objects.

421
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,994
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dig holes.

422
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:37,474
Yeah.

423
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:39,476
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dig holes.

424
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:40,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

425
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:41,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

426
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:42,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, pick up your mic.

427
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:43,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand.

428
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:44,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fucking holes.

429
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:49,409
[SPEAKER_07]: But you will sit there and play The Sims for God knows how long, but this is just fucking holes?

430
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not playing Dress Up!

431
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:54,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But, okay.

432
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:55,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

433
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:58,798
[SPEAKER_08]: You can basically... Look at the videos on YouTube and stuff.

434
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:01,839
[SPEAKER_08]: You can create houses and stuff and forts.

435
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And later on, not to spoil anything, there's monsters... Wait, this is a closed page.

436
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:17,128
[SPEAKER_08]: There's monsters that come that you have to defend your little house or castle or whatever the hell you decide to make in it.

437
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,521
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can get torches that keep the evil things away.

438
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:33,380
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, it's a whole big, you know, it's almost like a little bit of tower defense with a little bit of, like, crafting and MMO with a little bit of, like, little big planet, you know,

439
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little of everything.

440
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:41,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just people like it because they can be extremely creative in it, and it's one of those games that never really ends.

441
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:42,562
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

442
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:44,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orange.radio.com.

443
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of comments.

444
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:50,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw says, and many of the Atari 2600 games are two-player online and no ability to play with others online with it.

445
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:51,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

446
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:57,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Room has huge flaws, and that's why it's not doing as well as you would think it would, and that's one of them.

447
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very, very sad because...

448
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:08,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Now nobody's going to attempt it again this generation, and that makes me very sad that they had such a great idea and then kind of made these few key decisions that just kind of ruin it.

449
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo-hiss.

450
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:10,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

451
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:14,445
[SPEAKER_07]: SalaciousPop says, Minecraft is item creation heaven hell.

452
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:18,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You dig, you build, you explore, you defend, you resource farm forever.

453
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:19,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Forever!

454
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLondrina.com if you want to join us on this lovely Sunday evening.

455
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,855
[SPEAKER_07]: While I get into some housekeeping, I didn't even mention it is 10, 10, 10.

456
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:28,855
42.

457
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:31,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy.

458
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how many people I know that got married today?

459
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:36,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Today was a huge wedding day because of the day.

460
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to a wedding next weekend.

461
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby was off tonight because of a wedding.

462
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

463
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:42,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so stupid.

464
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:44,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can remember your anniversary?

465
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:45,443
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what women want.

466
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Women want days that are cute, right?

467
00:26:48,644 --> 00:26:49,645
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not me.

468
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, September 1st, that works for me.

469
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:52,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Pee Wee Herman

470
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator in our chatroom says, I still love Game Room despite its faults.

471
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:26,016
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's kind of where I'm at, too, is that, you know, despite its faults, I do love the retro goodness that it brings out.

472
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like you have to love it.

473
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:31,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, boy, they're really reaching now with some of these games they're putting out.

474
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,301
[SPEAKER_07]: They're running out.

475
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:34,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they were able to bring any other publishers on board.

476
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:35,523
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of sad.

477
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:37,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

478
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:39,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and people are reminding me.

479
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:42,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Act F says 42 equals life, universe, and everything.

480
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because 10, 10, 10 in binary is 42.

481
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the answer?

482
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:49,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys need to really get over the numerology thing.

483
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:49,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

484
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:50,095
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

485
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with numerology.

486
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:53,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you ever read Hitchhiker's Guide?

487
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Like bits and pieces, but never the whole thing.

488
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will explain this in a nutshell.

489
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: The Earth was created to be a supercomputer to figure out the meaning of life or the answer to life or something.

490
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:07,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And before it got destroyed, it only got as far as 42.

491
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

492
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:10,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

493
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:11,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So 42 is the answer.

494
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the 42nd day, God rest it or whatever?

495
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:14,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 42.

496
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:15,499
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fine.

497
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

498
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy 10-10-10.

499
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:23,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Join our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.

500
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:28,805
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take those Twitter topics, so get those in for part B and so forth.

501
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:31,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Facebook, Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

502
00:28:31,886 --> 00:28:33,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.

503
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:34,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some actual gaming news.

504
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:35,829
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only, what, 30 minutes into the show?

505
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:36,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Need some gaming news?

506
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a tad.

507
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little bit.

508
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:39,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?

509
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:41,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, lots of stuff.

510
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:50,580
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, there's a new, I guess you would call it a handheld console that's coming from somebody that used to be in the console business and is not anymore.

511
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Panasonic.

512
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:55,284
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember them for the 3DO.

513
00:28:55,564 --> 00:29:01,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, maybe you don't remember them for the 3DO because it wasn't that great.

514
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:30,482
[SPEAKER_08]: um well now they have a wait was that the system with the terrible like Zelda and Mario knockoff games was that the 3DO or was it the CDI I always get those two mixed up cause they were they were right around the same time the 3DO had like some of the old um 3DO had Mega Race right did it um it may have had Mega Race it had I remember I played um You Don't Know Jack on the 3DO and I also played um Road Rash on the 3DO Road Rash is cool maybe Road Rash is what I was thinking of not Mega Race

515
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:33,155
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

516
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:55,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, they're gearing it for MMOs.

517
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing runs Linux, so it's obviously going to be able to run other things, but honestly, I don't know many MMOs that run natively in Linux.

518
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:14,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's nice that you made a console for MMOs that don't yet really exist for the console.

519
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but they get a lot of stuff to run on Linux.

520
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Does WoW run on Linux?

521
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:21,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it does.

522
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just PC and Mac.

523
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:26,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know Blizzard's very... People have gotten to run in the GNOME.

524
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:28,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not the GNOME, whatever the virtual environment is.

525
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:29,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Wine.

526
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:31,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

527
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:38,009
[SPEAKER_08]: It also comes with a mini HDMI port, a mini USB port, headphone jack, of course.

528
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,391
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of thick-looking.

529
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:43,552
[SPEAKER_08]: People say it looks kind of like the N-Gage.

530
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I'd compare it to the N-Gage.

531
00:30:46,994 --> 00:31:02,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and funny enough, they, uh, unveiled it on the MTV show to which this, at this point I was unaware of, uh, Rob, looks like, uh, Rob, uh, Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory.

532
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know anything about that show.

533
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:06,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

534
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:07,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

535
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:11,454
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a long way from downtown Julia Brown, that's all I'm saying.

536
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:20,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess along with the system, Panasonic is launching a Battlestar Galactica title for the device and a web show called Online Underground.

537
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:25,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if it's that same Battlestar Galactica MMO I saw at E3, because that looked kind of neat.

538
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:26,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

539
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:28,866
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks neat.

540
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:29,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

541
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:38,962
[SPEAKER_08]: If it actually supported MMOs or something to the point where it would be able to run them without any sort of lag or something, that might not be bad.

542
00:31:39,342 --> 00:31:45,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see this almost as something that you could, say, for example, stream something, kind of like the on-live stuff.

543
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:52,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe have this portable device with you, it connects to the web, and you can stream, say, something from your PC so you can play an MMO on it or something.

544
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:53,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you can.

545
00:32:19,932 --> 00:32:20,732
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

546
00:32:45,222 --> 00:33:13,253
[SPEAKER_08]: they have enabled that on all games but the thing is it really comes down to it comes down to the control set whether the control set will work with what's limited on the PSP but yeah anything is possible with the PS3 you can play any of the PS3 games on the PSP and I bet most people don't even know that type of functionality exists because Sony would rather market these other features that you know

547
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

548
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

549
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:22,716
[SPEAKER_07]: When I hear of this thing and I see this thing and you describing it, I don't think of this as like a handheld gaming device in a way.

550
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:23,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty large.

551
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:26,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I file this under the iPad competitor department.

552
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:35,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to me, yeah, it doesn't have a touchscreen or anything, but it seems more iPad-esque where it's more of like a computer that runs Linux.

553
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:39,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if it runs Linux, then who's to say I can just run MMOs on it?

554
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:41,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, couldn't I do spreadsheets on it?

555
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,891
[SPEAKER_07]: It's possible.

556
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:43,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

557
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:45,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's more of a computer than a gaming device.

558
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:50,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's all in the way they're marketing it, maybe, but it just seems strange to me.

559
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:53,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, didn't Sony try to play off the PS3 as a computer?

560
00:33:54,861 --> 00:34:01,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I don't know that was different because it's not like... Well, but you could run Linux on the PS3 at least for a limited time.

561
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:03,386
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't anymore.

562
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:08,169
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think... I don't know how many people really use that feature.

563
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:13,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when they took it out, certainly there was that core group of hackers and folks that were very upset.

564
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:20,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what the military had been using it or something is the processors and those things are disgustingly fast.

565
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:22,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like a really cheap supercomputer, but...

566
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people didn't get a PS3 to run Linux on it.

567
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people didn't.

568
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:31,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people got it to be a cheap Blu-ray player.

569
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:34,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it anyway.

570
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:35,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

571
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,030
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

572
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of MMOs, whether this one will run on this device or not, I don't know.

573
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:48,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But the biggest one, World of Warcraft, at least here in the U.S., has a release date for its next expansion.

574
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,221
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, the Cataclysm expansion.

575
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:52,801
[SPEAKER_07]: will be starting on December 7th.

576
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:56,042
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when World of Warcraft Cataclysm will hit stores.

577
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:57,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be $40 when it comes out.

578
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:08,425
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a collector's edition for $80 that comes with an art book, commentary DVD, soundtrack CD, mouse pad, trading cards, and a little in-game pet called Lil' Deathwing.

579
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:18,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can go out and run out and buy that in stores or, and I find this very interesting, we all kind of saw this coming after StarCraft II, they will be doing digital download with this.

580
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:31,917
[SPEAKER_07]: That strikes me as kind of amazing because they're not going to have those awesome media opportunities of folks lining up outside of stores and all that unless I guess they're just getting the collector's edition.

581
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:39,643
[SPEAKER_08]: People are pissed off that those collector's editions are really rare right now.

582
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:42,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's kind of like any of the other expansions.

583
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:55,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just interesting to me that they're going to go ahead and go the digital distribution route, and I don't know, it seems a little bit controversial, but Blizzard and the PC market can also kind of get away with doing whatever it wants right now, so...

584
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:57,709
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

585
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:25,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they, what, moved it around a bunch?

586
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:26,309
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

587
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:27,250
[SPEAKER_08]: They hinted at it.

588
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,571
[SPEAKER_07]: You said on the show it was going to be November, like a couple weeks ago.

589
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:34,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's what I'm saying that they said, and that's compared to what they've released in the past.

590
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:38,956
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently, no, it was, they were saying, there was some comment that they made.

591
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:46,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It was either an interview or something where they're like, yeah, there's a 12.7% chance of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

592
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it was kind of a little hint that they threw out that no one caught until...

593
00:36:52,623 --> 00:36:58,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm saying, they could put this game out on Christmas Eve and people would still be lining up to get it.

594
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it just doesn't matter.

595
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that kind of game.

596
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:02,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with Diablo 3.

597
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:06,597
[SPEAKER_07]: If they wanted to release Diablo 3 on Thanksgiving, they could do it.

598
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

599
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:14,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at comments from chat.orangeontraday.com ToyGak in our chatroom says, I hate digital distribution.

600
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:15,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard media forever.

601
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:17,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe physical media?

602
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

603
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:24,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I know neither of you really play WoW, but let's say this was an expansion to a game you do really like.

604
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:36,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say DarkSakura was a Star Trek Online second edition or something, and I don't know, for Loki, Grand Theft Auto V. Would you bypass the store completely in favor of digital distribution?

605
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:37,005
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

606
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:37,065
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

607
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:38,698
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

608
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:02,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I have been known in the past to go the digital route to get it slightly early.

609
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:04,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, alright.

610
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:06,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And then buy a physical copy later on.

611
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:09,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I couldn't find all my WoW stuff, I downloaded it.

612
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,111
[SPEAKER_03]: When I would try to play again.

613
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:38,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Boshka in our chatroom says collector's edition is barely worth it $40 for a pet, no thanks a lot of collector's editions just have a CD and a book and all that a lot of collector's editions nowadays to me it seems like they're not worth it anymore like I used to buy collector's editions for different things like Bioshock and Saints Row 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 and stuff like that it's just a bunch of crap that they throw in there I mean

614
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:40,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

615
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee in our chat says, but does it come with a plate and a spoon?

616
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:02,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of in a reference to that Dreamcast game that DarkSakura has.

617
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:10,975
[SPEAKER_07]: DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says, my biggest issue with digital distro is if something happens to my computer, if I can re-download it, I would do digital.

618
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:12,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's something that Blizzard's pretty good about, though.

619
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:18,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even if you have these games from way before there was ever digital distribution, like, for instance...

620
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:39,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Dan up there in his collection has a Warcraft 3 game and there's a serial number on that if he goes to battle.net and enters in that serial number it'll get attached to his account and he could always redownload Warcraft 3 wherever he's at so it's kind of you know that is one thing Blizzard's pretty good about is that once you do have the game tied to your account you could always redownload it anywhere kind of interesting so

621
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:43,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, one other quick note here on World of Warcraft.

622
00:39:43,765 --> 00:39:49,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also announced by Blizzard this week that they have surpassed the 12 million subscriber mark.

623
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:53,070
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, there are now 12 million subscribers for World of Warcraft.

624
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:55,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind that's not just in the US.

625
00:39:55,592 --> 00:40:01,856
[SPEAKER_07]: This is partially attributed to the fact that Wrath of the Lich King finally came out in mainland China just about a month ago.

626
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, Cataclysm is coming out here soon, so everybody's getting ready for that.

627
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:06,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

628
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

629
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is interesting.

630
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,722
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time there was a big population increase announcement was December 2008 when it got to 11.5 million.

631
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of folks at that time thought, oh, wow, it's topped off, it's dying.

632
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,324
[SPEAKER_07]: But nope, they got up to 12 million this week.

633
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:28,106
[SPEAKER_07]: But probably not likely to ever get as high as 20 million as some people thought it once would.

634
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:31,287
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 20 million people living in Australia, just so you know.

635
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:34,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, Australia.

636
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the holdup?

637
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:39,373
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

638
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:00,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more stuff.

639
00:41:00,602 --> 00:41:01,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I love stuff.

640
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,683
[SPEAKER_03]: How about DC Universe?

641
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:05,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, I'm really looking forward to DC Universe Online.

642
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you gotta wait.

643
00:41:07,306 --> 00:41:08,967
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

644
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:11,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been delayed until spring 2010.

645
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:11,169
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

646
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, spring 2010, then it's already out.

647
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:14,031
11.

648
00:41:14,091 --> 00:41:14,191
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

649
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:14,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means that...

650
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:25,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a while.

651
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:29,130
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the beta is going to be available in November.

652
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:38,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be, if you pre-order the game, then you are guaranteed access to the November 30th beta.

653
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:44,714
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pre-order before November 15th to make it into the beta.

654
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:50,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can still get the game in November, you just have to pre-order the game to play the test game?

655
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:51,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

656
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:52,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

657
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:52,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

658
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to pay me to be a tester?

659
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm doing their job, right?

660
00:41:57,811 --> 00:41:58,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course not.

661
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still very excited about DC Universe Online.

662
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:09,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sad to hear it's getting delayed, but at the same time, there was another big MMO that came out very recently that I said should probably be delayed until 2011.

663
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:10,144
[SPEAKER_07]: But boy, did they listen.

664
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, boy, did they listen.

665
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:14,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

666
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:17,589
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what this game has to do to take the time to get it right, then you know what?

667
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So be it.

668
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, Rob.

669
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,211
[SPEAKER_08]: They can always just patch it later on.

670
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:23,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

671
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:25,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an MMO.

672
00:42:25,372 --> 00:42:26,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't need to be finished.

673
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:28,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Finish?

674
00:42:28,774 --> 00:42:29,734
[SPEAKER_08]: It's never finished.

675
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:30,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an MMO.

676
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:31,855
[SPEAKER_08]: We're always adding stuff.

677
00:42:31,975 --> 00:42:32,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, fixing things.

678
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:34,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, making it not shitty.

679
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw sharing a new sound effect for us.

680
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:47,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this is the sister to sad trombone to play when we have depressing stories like DC Universe Online is delayed until spring 2011.

681
00:42:47,354 --> 00:42:51,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's not a new one.

682
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:53,177
[SPEAKER_07]: This is called sadtuba.com.

683
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:56,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a sad tuba.

684
00:42:56,218 --> 00:42:57,419
[SPEAKER_07]: The price is right losing horn.

685
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:03,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was going to be the sad trombone thing played on a tuba.

686
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:04,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought it would be.

687
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:05,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

688
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:09,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the craziest, dorkiest thing I've ever heard.

689
00:43:10,017 --> 00:43:10,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

690
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:11,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

691
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:15,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on quickly before I embarrass myself again.

692
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:18,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so this is kind of neat.

693
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,640
[SPEAKER_08]: OnLive apparently is ditching the monthly charge and they're going free.

694
00:43:25,421 --> 00:43:28,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently they're also working on... Well, they did talk about this.

695
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:32,763
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on a mini streaming console that's supposed to be manufactured soon.

696
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:47,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the former $14.95 per month service, which was through its founding members program, they have offered now a year of free service.

697
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:53,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, they're also going to be offering a bunch of free demos and stuff to check out.

698
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the free service is not free forever.

699
00:43:56,763 --> 00:43:57,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just...

700
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,586
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like a trial type thing.

701
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:09,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can basically create an account with no monthly cost, no credit card needed for sign up, and lots of free stuff to play.

702
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the micro console, it's going to be like kind of a streaming box.

703
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:20,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Think of like a sling box or something like that with a controller built in and you can basically plug it into a TV.

704
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it almost looks like maybe like an Apple TV or something like that.

705
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:28,029
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

706
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:55,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, that was certainly a drawback to OnLive was this whole monthly fee.

707
00:44:56,033 --> 00:44:56,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, really?

708
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:59,396
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to pay me a monthly fee to buy games?

709
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:01,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems a little strange.

710
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:05,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're having to join... I'd like someone to pay me a monthly fee to buy games.

711
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:10,085
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I thought that the monthly fee was just to play whatever on their service.

712
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:12,607
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

713
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:14,989
[SPEAKER_07]: You still have to rent the games or buy the games.

714
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:20,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And even when you buy them, it's only guaranteed for three years because you're playing on someone else's computer.

715
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:25,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the service ever gets shut down in three years or whatever, then it's gone.

716
00:45:25,537 --> 00:45:36,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's still a little bit iffy, but if you're the type that just wants to rent games or check out the game demos, which certainly is useful, then it might be worth it.

717
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:39,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I still need to sign up and check it out.

718
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to make use of the game rental part.

719
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:47,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the whole free demo thing might be kind of cool because, say, for example...

720
00:45:48,477 --> 00:46:07,499
[SPEAKER_08]: you know you want to play like one of the new games that's coming out recently or very soon or something like that and they have a demo for it you don't want to spend time downloading i mean because some of these demos out there are you know a few gigs in the download that it might take a very long time and then you have to install it and that takes more time this you can just

721
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:08,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Play it and go.

722
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:10,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, don't like it?

723
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:10,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the next one.

724
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:17,557
[SPEAKER_08]: No need to download, install, worry about doing all that stuff.

725
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:19,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of play it as you go.

726
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:20,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

727
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And plus you could have a crappy computer and it still plays.

728
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be kind of cool to do with, say, an Xbox 360 or something like that.

729
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:30,706
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't have to download the demo.

730
00:46:30,786 --> 00:46:32,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I can just, boom, play the demo instantly.

731
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet that's going to be a big feature in the next generation of consoles.

732
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:38,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

733
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:43,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I said a while ago that this is the games analyst in me.

734
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:47,701
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them, probably PlayStation, is going to be ballsy enough to try and go all digital.

735
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cut out the physical media completely.

736
00:46:50,364 --> 00:46:52,046
[SPEAKER_07]: That worked so well for them in the past.

737
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:53,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

738
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'll be different.

739
00:46:55,802 --> 00:47:04,454
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with the PSP Go is that it was really more money for the removal of a future.

740
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:08,600
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they had charged $99 for that thing, it would have done great.

741
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:11,083
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the difference.

742
00:47:12,324 --> 00:47:12,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

743
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:17,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, with the PSP2 being announced next year, I'm sure we'll see what's coming.

744
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:19,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we will.

745
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:23,852
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing we know is coming very soon is NBA Jam.

746
00:47:23,912 --> 00:47:26,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently lots of interesting stuff going on with NBA Jam.

747
00:47:26,994 --> 00:47:35,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this was covered last week or if it was this week or what, but NBA Jam, I guess, ended up getting split off from the NBA game on the 360 and the PS3, right?

748
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:35,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

749
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's coming out as a standalone game.

750
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:38,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of interesting.

751
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:38,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

752
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:47,165
[SPEAKER_07]: and one thing we wanted to see in NBA Jam would be hidden characters because you know the old school NBA Jam was awesome because it had what?

753
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:52,986
[SPEAKER_07]: It had like Scorpion and some of the Mortal Kombat characters and I think Bill Clinton was in there somewhere, right?

754
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:53,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

755
00:47:53,627 --> 00:47:58,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently this new NBA Jam is keeping with the political ha-ha's

756
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:24,076
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can actually unlock Obama and Sarah Palin as playable characters so yeah there are it's out on the Wii now so you can check it out and there's actually some codes have already been found on how to unlock certain things I guess you can get some furries and everything wow yeah I'm trying to look at some of the things you can unlock here yeah it looks like you can unlock some of the mascots there

757
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:25,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

758
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they have the mascots available in the old ones too.

759
00:48:29,308 --> 00:48:29,928
[SPEAKER_07]: A furry dream.

760
00:48:30,228 --> 00:48:32,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have Bush and Chaney on your team.

761
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:33,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

762
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you want them to play basketball.

763
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:38,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Bush has mad hoop skills, of course.

764
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:39,592
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

765
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:42,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to look up some of these codes.

766
00:48:42,313 --> 00:48:43,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are they?

767
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:45,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, there we go.

768
00:48:45,414 --> 00:48:47,275
[SPEAKER_07]: You can unlock the Beastie Boys as a team.

769
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:47,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

770
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:48,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like.

771
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:49,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

772
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:52,177
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a lot of hidden people in this.

773
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:53,798
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

774
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:56,600
[SPEAKER_07]: ManuteBowl is hidden in there.

775
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

776
00:49:00,142 --> 00:49:06,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, I don't know if you heard about how close NBA Elite was to being released.

777
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:15,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, to the point where an actual retail copy of it leaked out like a disc because I guess they sent them to retailers and then the retailers had to send them back.

778
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:17,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

779
00:49:18,134 --> 00:49:25,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently, according to the person that bought one of the retail copies off eBay, the game was really buggy and really fucking terrible.

780
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:29,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, just all sorts of glitches and bad stuff in there.

781
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:34,467
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, they had NBA Jam on the PS3 with that.

782
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:43,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently that was... They have, I guess, some of the features that they're talking about adding in now were actually going to be download content in there.

783
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:46,115
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're saying, oh yeah, it's not done yet.

784
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:48,496
[SPEAKER_08]: We're adding remix mode or whatever to the game.

785
00:49:48,816 --> 00:49:50,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, we're going to release it anyways.

786
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:55,557
[SPEAKER_08]: You just, now you're not spending extra money for it or something.

787
00:49:56,677 --> 00:50:02,738
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw sent me a link in our chatroom at chat.orangemonster.com and I remember seeing this earlier this week and kind of like rolling my eyes.

788
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:09,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of these stories about when people who don't play games talk about games.

789
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:10,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

790
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:11,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, did you hear about this?

791
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,400
[SPEAKER_07]: This is on Fox News.

792
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:18,535
[SPEAKER_00]: facing off against President Obama in basketball.

793
00:50:19,156 --> 00:50:21,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on some court in Washington or Wasilla.

794
00:50:21,157 --> 00:50:25,040
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new Nintendo Wii version of the video game NBA Jam.

795
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize, this is quiet.

796
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:31,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Head-to-head competition shooting hoops along with a host of high-profile politicians.

797
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:33,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Moore is president.

798
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:37,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, they go on to wonder if they're going to make a bipartisan game and all this stuff.

799
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, really?

800
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:38,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

801
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

802
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Obama had some sort of super move and the rest didn't.

803
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:48,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's unfair.

804
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he's the president and the rest aren't.

805
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's really quite that simple, right?

806
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:55,306
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, right?

807
00:50:55,706 --> 00:50:55,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Ugh.

808
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:57,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

809
00:50:57,568 --> 00:50:57,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

810
00:50:58,128 --> 00:50:58,368
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

811
00:50:58,428 --> 00:50:59,629
[SPEAKER_03]: How about something a little different?

812
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:01,190
[SPEAKER_07]: How about something a little different?

813
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,471
[SPEAKER_03]: More about the Wii.

814
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:04,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we just had a story on the Wii.

815
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:06,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is about Capcom.

816
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:08,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

817
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:12,800
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be some more downloads coming out for Virtual Console.

818
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is particularly for the UK release.

819
00:51:20,046 --> 00:51:21,307
[SPEAKER_03]: There is going to be...

820
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghosts and Goblins, which we love in this house.

821
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And 1942 will be available.

822
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:36,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Black Dragon, which is a little obscure.

823
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:42,475
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they don't have a date yet on them, but they're going to be 800 points apiece.

824
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:48,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And also other ones that were recently announced were Commando, Son Son, and...

825
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: XX, so X-Dexis, XX.

826
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Quiz and Dragons?

827
00:51:55,205 --> 00:51:58,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been asking since the top of the show, where's my Quiz and Dragons?

828
00:51:58,829 --> 00:51:59,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that on the list?

829
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:00,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

830
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:03,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Alas, no, Rob, it is not on the list.

831
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:04,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Pingo!

832
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:27,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Pingo was a Sega game, wasn't it?

833
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:28,229
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Sega.

834
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:30,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking of more obscurity.

835
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:31,711
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

836
00:52:32,872 --> 00:52:33,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this.

837
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:37,134
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little bit of delay between when we talk and when the chat room gets it.

838
00:52:37,174 --> 00:52:39,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So the chat room is commenting on the whole Fox News thing.

839
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:42,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orangehunchradio.com This is a good joke.

840
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:46,100
[SPEAKER_07]: They're talking about how Obama gets the special move.

841
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,121
[SPEAKER_07]: The Republicans have nothing.

842
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:50,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitstun goes, but all the Republicans have an 8 in steel.

843
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:52,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

844
00:52:52,845 --> 00:52:53,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a political joke.

845
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:55,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, come on.

846
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, that's kind of funny.

847
00:52:59,988 --> 00:53:03,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Abraham Lincoln to be in NBA Jam.

848
00:53:03,669 --> 00:53:05,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should do an all-presidential one.

849
00:53:05,569 --> 00:53:06,929
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be awesome.

850
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:09,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And why leave it to just U.S.

851
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,850
[SPEAKER_07]: presidents?

852
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not do some royalty as well?

853
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Margaret Thatcher!

854
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:17,432
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, get Margaret Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Gaga while we're at it.

855
00:53:17,472 --> 00:53:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Should definitely be on a team.

856
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:19,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really surprised.

857
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:19,713
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

858
00:53:36,573 --> 00:53:38,595
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

859
00:53:55,874 --> 00:53:56,414
[SPEAKER_03]: and Chuck Norris.

860
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:20,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have a list list coming up.

861
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:21,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we're going to end up doing it tonight.

862
00:54:21,754 --> 00:54:24,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll roll it over to next week when we actually have a special guest here.

863
00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:28,935
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're actually going to do a list list on character I most want to see in NBA Jam.

864
00:54:29,495 --> 00:54:30,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can look forward to that.

865
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,315
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll probably end up doing that next week.

866
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:35,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to table that to next week because we didn't end up having a fourth person here tonight.

867
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to have a guest next week.

868
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:41,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk more about that a little later on in the show because it's very exciting for very exciting reasons.

869
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:43,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be retrotastic next week and I'll tell you why.

870
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:45,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting guest is exciting.

871
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:46,278
[SPEAKER_07]: A little later on in the show.

872
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:53,178
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, let's go and travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming soon to a store near you, Loki.

873
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, lots of good stuff actually.

874
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're knee deep in releases this week.

875
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:08,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off, of course, the big one, Medal of Honor on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

876
00:55:09,326 --> 00:55:11,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcania Gothic 4.

877
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Scribblenauts Sledge Shred

878
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:38,843
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

879
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:57,409
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a terrible game, and it's on the Wii.

880
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Other fun stuff.

881
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

882
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:04,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Disney Sing It Party hits on the Wii and PS3.

883
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:10,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Zuzu Pets, Kung Zu on Nintendo DS and Wii.

884
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe just on the DS.

885
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Vampire Moon, The Mystery of the Hidden Sun.

886
00:56:16,763 --> 00:56:18,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another adventure game on Nintendo DS.

887
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:19,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

888
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:23,652
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Frisbee in our chatroom asked a damn good question.

889
00:56:23,752 --> 00:56:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Deal or No Deal still on?

890
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:25,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it is.

891
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the syndicated one got canned this year, didn't it?

892
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

893
00:56:29,802 --> 00:56:30,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's coming back, though?

894
00:56:30,903 --> 00:56:32,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I read game show blogs.

895
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:33,608
[SPEAKER_07]: One versus a...

896
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:40,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Deal or No Deal is still on the air because now they're doing the stupid thing where it's like the actual contestants are opening the cases.

897
00:56:40,866 --> 00:56:42,347
[SPEAKER_08]: They couldn't afford to pay the models anymore.

898
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:43,728
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was the syndicated one.

899
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:44,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's on the air anymore.

900
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:48,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that went off the air to make room for this year's batch of judge shows and all that.

901
00:56:49,332 --> 00:56:54,376
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, I will say 1 vs. 100 is officially coming back to Game Show Network and it has a new host.

902
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:55,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be Bob Saget.

903
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:56,637
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready for this?

904
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:58,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess who's hosting 1 vs. 100 now?

905
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:04,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Arsino Hall tested for it, but no, they passed over Arsino Hall for... Ready?

906
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:06,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your groaning noises ready.

907
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, let me get SadTuba ready.

908
00:57:08,044 --> 00:57:08,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on.

909
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:10,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to get SadTuba ready for this.

910
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:11,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me think.

911
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:14,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to guess how terrible it could be.

912
00:57:17,942 --> 00:57:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's not Mark McGrath, is it?

913
00:57:19,923 --> 00:57:20,663
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

914
00:57:21,044 --> 00:57:22,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he does the lyrics show.

915
00:57:22,764 --> 00:57:23,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but he's still terrible.

916
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:24,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

917
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:32,728
[SPEAKER_07]: No, hosting 1 vs. 100 on Game Show Network with a top prize of $50,000, down from a million, Carrie Ann Inaba.

918
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:35,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Who the hell's that?

919
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,110
[SPEAKER_07]: From Dancing with the Stars.

920
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:37,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

921
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

922
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:39,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

923
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:43,617
[SPEAKER_07]: She's the girl on Dancing with the Stars.

924
00:57:43,637 --> 00:57:44,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you.

925
00:57:44,157 --> 00:57:50,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know it takes a real dancer to know how to... If you want to replace Bob Saget, you know who you need to pick.

926
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:50,840
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

927
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom Bergeron.

928
00:57:52,321 --> 00:57:52,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom Bergeron.

929
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:53,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

930
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he's busy hosting Dancing with the Stars.

931
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,863
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like the biggest show on TV now.

932
00:57:58,203 --> 00:58:01,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on, it doesn't take that long to host Dancing with the Stars.

933
00:58:01,206 --> 00:58:05,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on, he can fit it in his workday to go host that other show.

934
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:09,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, shit, that's like, you know, maybe four hours at the most.

935
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:17,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy pants to me, though, that the 1 vs. 100 is, like, gone from Xbox Live so that they can do this cheap version on Game Show Network with Kariana Nava.

936
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:17,699
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

937
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:18,159
[SPEAKER_07]: No disrespect.

938
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it'll be fine, and it's gonna be, you know, for an original game show, it'll be fine.

939
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:22,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you...

940
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:29,966
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is totally random, but it makes no sense because I actually saw this on the soup, I think.

941
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:34,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Punk'd is coming back, and they're having Justin Bieber hosting it.

942
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:35,989
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is that?

943
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that has to be a lie.

944
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe that.

945
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That has as much truth as the LAPD buying all the jetpacks.

946
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:43,652
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how true that story is.

947
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:44,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

948
00:58:46,854 --> 00:58:47,434
[SPEAKER_07]: No way.

949
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:50,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Justin Bieber is too busy.

950
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:55,102
[SPEAKER_07]: He's making 15-year-old girls' panties wet all across internationally.

951
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:56,824
[SPEAKER_07]: That's his job.

952
00:58:56,964 --> 00:58:57,946
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't have time to do punk.

953
00:58:58,006 --> 00:59:03,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And seriously, they have a bunch of other cast members from that 70s show that aren't working right now that can easily host that.

954
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:04,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

955
00:59:07,725 --> 00:59:10,228
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

956
00:59:25,004 --> 00:59:29,267
[SPEAKER_08]: My Baby 3 on the Nintendo DS.

957
00:59:29,287 --> 00:59:39,456
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the game that actually had a lawsuit pending with it because Majesco and apparently some other company were fighting over the rights to My Baby.

958
00:59:40,897 --> 01:00:04,021
[SPEAKER_08]: they're fighting over my baby Borderlands give me the year edition coming out this week that's right Borderlands with all the extra download content all for 60 bucks that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 seriously if you don't own this game you need to buy it which I don't actually so this might be a good deal you need to buy it it's fucking amazing I'm gonna wait for the price drop the inevitable price drop that will happen on this game

959
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:06,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the original game has already dropped in price.

960
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:08,863
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I can get the one with all the Uber content.

961
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:11,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't there like a zombie expansion or something?

962
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:13,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was one of the first expansions.

963
01:00:13,505 --> 01:00:14,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I need that, don't I?

964
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:15,166
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

965
01:00:15,366 --> 01:00:17,347
[SPEAKER_08]: It seriously is awesome.

966
01:00:17,627 --> 01:00:20,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then the Invisimals coming out on the PSP this week.

967
01:00:20,848 --> 01:00:22,590
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, it's the game with the camera.

968
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, camera.

969
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:31,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only been waiting years for that stupid thing to come out on the PSP, and now you release it with a crappy-ass game.

970
01:00:32,678 --> 01:00:36,761
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, iPet's coming out on the PSP in a couple weeks anyways.

971
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:38,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, terrible.

972
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:43,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals on Nintendo DS.

973
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, Lufia's old school.

974
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:48,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't a Lufia what I use in the shower to wash my butt?

975
01:00:48,071 --> 01:00:48,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Lufa.

976
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:56,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada Hunt on the Wii it's where you hunt Canadians

977
01:00:57,546 --> 01:00:58,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

978
01:00:58,826 --> 01:00:59,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

979
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:00,747
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

980
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:01,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was like, damn.

981
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:05,508
[SPEAKER_08]: If by Canadians you mean native wildlife in Canada.

982
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:07,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Like mooses and shit?

983
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:07,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

984
01:01:08,169 --> 01:01:10,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boring.

985
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:11,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon's Lair Trilogy.

986
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:14,010
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome because it doesn't have three dragons.

987
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,770
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no third Dragon's Lair.

988
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet one of them is Space Ace.

989
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:18,211
[SPEAKER_08]: You are correct.

990
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, wait a minute.

991
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:21,592
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no Dragon's Lair 3.

992
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of Dragon's Lair.

993
01:01:23,832 --> 01:01:25,753
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Dragon's Lair in space.

994
01:01:26,153 --> 01:01:26,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

995
01:01:27,593 --> 01:01:52,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucha Libre Heroes Del Ring that's coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week Dragon Age Origins the Ultimate Edition also another re-release with both Dragon Age Origins and the Awakenings expansion I think all the download content as well that's going to be coming out for $50 at least on PC I think it's $60 on PS3 and 360 um

996
01:01:57,162 --> 01:01:59,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that makes no sense at all.

997
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:01,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess that was with the system.

998
01:02:02,206 --> 01:02:02,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind.

999
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:05,688
[SPEAKER_08]: For a second there, I thought they were selling invisibles by itself.

1000
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, what would you do with that?

1001
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:08,110
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have the camera.

1002
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:13,034
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, bringing the gaming news to you, we think, here at Orange Sands Radio.

1003
01:02:13,413 --> 01:02:18,436
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're actually selling the system because they think Invisimals is a system seller.

1004
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:21,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a brace yourself.

1005
01:02:21,717 --> 01:02:22,658
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hilarious.

1006
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:29,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Sengoku Barsara Samurai Heroes, the game which was originally over here as... Oh, of course, now I can't remember.

1007
01:02:29,982 --> 01:02:30,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Devil Kings.

1008
01:02:31,183 --> 01:02:34,264
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on PlayStation 3 and on the Wii, of course, because it uses Waggle.

1009
01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:36,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And now PS3 has Waggle, so that's also fun.

1010
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:40,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I Love Puppies on Nintendo DS.

1011
01:02:40,768 --> 01:02:41,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1012
01:02:42,981 --> 01:02:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say really much more about that.

1013
01:02:45,103 --> 01:02:49,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, the game of the year edition with all the download content in there.

1014
01:02:49,188 --> 01:02:49,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Good God.

1015
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:51,551
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the third one.

1016
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:53,133
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing a lot of re-releases.

1017
01:02:53,553 --> 01:02:55,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, is Just Dance 2 this week?

1018
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:56,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Just Dance 2 is this week.

1019
01:02:57,057 --> 01:02:57,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

1020
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:00,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Reason to hook up my Wii.

1021
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:01,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it.

1022
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:02,103
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty fun.

1023
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, I don't know where the YouTube videos are.

1024
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:05,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

1025
01:03:06,187 --> 01:03:07,007
[SPEAKER_08]: They're out there somewhere.

1026
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:13,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I die, I have to see Loki getting down to TikTok.

1027
01:03:13,729 --> 01:03:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, it was worse than that.

1028
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:17,370
[SPEAKER_08]: We did It's Rainy Men.

1029
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:18,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

1030
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It's somewhere on YouTube, right?

1031
01:03:21,871 --> 01:03:22,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Already?

1032
01:03:22,451 --> 01:03:24,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it is on YouTube.

1033
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:25,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw needs to find it.

1034
01:03:26,352 --> 01:03:27,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he finds everything on the internet.

1035
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:29,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I can find it if it's actually out there.

1036
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do that later.

1037
01:03:31,413 --> 01:03:55,289
[SPEAKER_08]: um hey Miklatov sent me a private message that he is buying the Invisimals bundle because it's blue well that's his own weird fascination with stuff colored blue I mean I don't know uh the Guild 2 Renaissance that's on uh PC not the Felicia Day show not the Felicia Day show uh Painkiller Pandemonium on PC meh um

1038
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize Rock Band 3 was coming out this week.

1039
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:01,980
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1040
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,561
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

1041
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:03,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1042
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:04,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's not.

1043
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:07,129
[SPEAKER_08]: But for some reason, the wireless keyboard's available this week.

1044
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:08,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome!

1045
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I can pretend I'm playing Rock Band.

1046
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:11,717
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1047
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and it would be great also, Solitaire Overload Plus.

1048
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,181
[SPEAKER_08]: These release dates coming to an end, that would be great too.

1049
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:19,602
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're not.

1050
01:04:19,642 --> 01:04:20,182
[SPEAKER_08]: God!

1051
01:04:20,442 --> 01:04:27,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello Kitty DS Bundle, they're releasing Hello Kitty with a... Because clearly you've saved the AAA titles for last.

1052
01:04:27,846 --> 01:04:30,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Brunswick Cosmic Bowling with a Bowling Ball.

1053
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:33,264
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds dangerous.

1054
01:04:36,325 --> 01:04:39,727
[SPEAKER_08]: They just did that to make it lulzy to fit that on the shelves at GameStop.

1055
01:04:39,807 --> 01:04:41,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is GameStop's website.

1056
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:43,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading off of it right here.

1057
01:04:43,389 --> 01:04:45,331
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii inflatable racing cart.

1058
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:45,851
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1059
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:49,013
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that you can play Mario Kart in is coming to stores this week.

1060
01:04:49,873 --> 01:04:50,674
[SPEAKER_08]: That is exciting.

1061
01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:51,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.

1062
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:53,195
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an actual inflatable cart?

1063
01:04:53,215 --> 01:04:56,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Inflatable cart that you can sit in.

1064
01:04:56,257 --> 01:05:00,000
[SPEAKER_03]: You stick the steering wheel in there and you... I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

1065
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, I want to buy this and bring it over.

1066
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:02,581
Okay.

1067
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:05,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You can spend your money on it and you can drive over here.

1068
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:06,384
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is it?

1069
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:07,845
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is the inflatable cart?

1070
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:09,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 40 bucks.

1071
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,087
[SPEAKER_07]: That's quite a bit of money.

1072
01:05:11,147 --> 01:05:11,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1073
01:05:12,453 --> 01:05:20,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually going to say, because I don't think it made our show roll, but they actually have, there was another peripheral that's coming out that's also inflatable.

1074
01:05:21,336 --> 01:05:24,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an inflatable raft to play with Connect Adventures.

1075
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:25,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was on our Twitter.

1076
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:26,798
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1077
01:05:27,238 --> 01:05:27,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1078
01:05:27,778 --> 01:05:28,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got it.

1079
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:28,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1080
01:05:28,939 --> 01:05:30,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an inflatable raft.

1081
01:05:30,859 --> 01:05:32,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an inflatable raft.

1082
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,860
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

1083
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1084
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:40,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, people can't pretend they have the actual inflatable raft for the truly immersive experience, apparently.

1085
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:46,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this is a pretty big one this week.

1086
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:51,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirby's Epic Yarn is coming out on the Wii, and that'll be a week from today.

1087
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is it.

1088
01:05:56,434 --> 01:05:56,714
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1089
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:58,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to Japanese release dates.

1090
01:05:58,813 --> 01:05:59,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to make this quick and painless.

1091
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:04,775
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan, on the Xbox 360, Medal of Honor gets its release this week.

1092
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:07,115
[SPEAKER_07]: NBA 2K11, also coming out in Japan this week.

1093
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:11,636
[SPEAKER_07]: SBKX Superbike World Championship comes out as well.

1094
01:06:11,996 --> 01:06:16,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And some new Xbox 360 wireless headsets and network adapters come out in some different colors.

1095
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:20,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's because of the soon-to-come upgrades with the voice chat.

1096
01:06:20,298 --> 01:06:20,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1097
01:06:20,919 --> 01:06:22,099
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are coming out anyhow.

1098
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:32,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on over to the PlayStation 3 Medal of Honor NBA 2K11 and World Soccer Winning 11 2011 all come out this week.

1099
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:33,742
[SPEAKER_07]: So look forward to that.

1100
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:36,563
[SPEAKER_07]: World Soccer Winning 11 is a few days behind the others.

1101
01:06:36,603 --> 01:06:37,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's on a special day.

1102
01:06:37,843 --> 01:06:39,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So just a heads up on that.

1103
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:40,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on the usual release day.

1104
01:06:41,785 --> 01:06:45,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Going over to the Nintendo Wii, and the game's coming out there.

1105
01:06:45,987 --> 01:06:52,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaito no Kirby comes out on the Nintendo Wii, which is just the same Kirby game that Loki was earlier talking about.

1106
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:53,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the Japanese version.

1107
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:57,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing on the PlayStation 2, because obviously things are drying up over there.

1108
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:03,679
[SPEAKER_07]: But looking at the handhelds real quick, on the Sony PSP, DJ Max Portable 3 comes out.

1109
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:08,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know we have some folks that are really into the music games that are really looking forward to this, probably already have their pre-orders ready.

1110
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:09,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Set to go.

1111
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:12,466
[SPEAKER_07]: That is coming out in Korea this week.

1112
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:13,988
[SPEAKER_07]: The first print and the limited edition.

1113
01:07:14,028 --> 01:07:16,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's folks already having their imports on the way.

1114
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:21,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, as far as Japanese releases go, Lord of Arcana comes out this week.

1115
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:24,361
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a Squeenix game that is coming out in Japan.

1116
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:27,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So take a look at that if you're into the Squeenix games.

1117
01:07:28,105 --> 01:07:57,531
[SPEAKER_07]: otherwise NBA 2K11 also coming out on the PSP and Memories Off 6 Next Relation is coming out as well I have no idea what that is but it's called Memories Off 6 Next Relation it just shows kind of a chick dancing on the cover so I'm just more relations I'm assuming it's just yet another little dating game because but there's a part where she's singing karaoke and there's another part look at this this girl here she's kind of a whore like she's lying on the bed and her blouse is like half open look at that I can see her boobies you don't see nipple but you definitely see her boobies

1118
01:07:59,090 --> 01:07:59,870
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just tired.

1119
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:01,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And it must be hard.

1120
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:02,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Tired of wearing clothes.

1121
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what she's tired of.

1122
01:08:06,032 --> 01:08:06,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly on the DS.

1123
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:08,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I skipped over the DS completely.

1124
01:08:08,473 --> 01:08:10,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if I can look up DS releases real quick here.

1125
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:14,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't think there's a whole lot coming out this week, actually.

1126
01:08:16,955 --> 01:08:21,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Gingotetsu Duo 999 DS.

1127
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,517
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in a huge box.

1128
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:26,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an exotic sci-fi game.

1129
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:28,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out.

1130
01:08:29,078 --> 01:08:31,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, because it's in limited and premium box edition.

1131
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if there's screenshots here on the regular version.

1132
01:08:35,121 --> 01:08:38,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that Galaxy Express or something?

1133
01:08:38,602 --> 01:08:40,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be because I noticed it has the Chi-Chi train in it.

1134
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, so it's Galaxy Express.

1135
01:08:43,124 --> 01:08:43,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there it is.

1136
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:45,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that, you anime nerds.

1137
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:46,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

1138
01:08:46,766 --> 01:08:48,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see what they're doing live action?

1139
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what the fuck was it?

1140
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:53,288
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Spaceship Yamamoto.

1141
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yamato.

1142
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:55,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Yamato, yeah.

1143
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:56,750
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a live action one of that.

1144
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks awesome.

1145
01:08:57,475 --> 01:08:58,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Starblazers in the US.

1146
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:01,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, wake me when they have a panty and stocking game, okay?

1147
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:02,119
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm saying.

1148
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something Alan turned me on to this week.

1149
01:09:05,802 --> 01:09:06,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Panty and stocking.

1150
01:09:06,682 --> 01:09:07,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Look it up on YouTube.

1151
01:09:07,463 --> 01:09:07,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's epic.

1152
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:08,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the music, Rob.

1153
01:09:09,084 --> 01:09:10,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Need more cosplay.

1154
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:11,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need the music?

1155
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:12,235
[SPEAKER_07]: We need the music.

1156
01:09:12,395 --> 01:09:13,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I'll get the music.

1157
01:09:13,576 --> 01:09:15,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you explain what panty and stocking is real quick while I get the music?

1158
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an anime by Gainax and the same guys that did Powerpuff Girls Z, which was the sort of more teenage version of Powerpuff Girls they did in Japan.

1159
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:27,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, she needs to get to the good stuff.

1160
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:27,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1161
01:09:27,885 --> 01:09:29,786
[SPEAKER_07]: The chick kicks off her panties and turns them into a gun.

1162
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:30,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1163
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:34,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about two angels kicked out of heaven, one for having too much sex and the other for eating too much sex.

1164
01:09:39,494 --> 01:09:40,896
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from their transformation.

1165
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:47,963
[SPEAKER_07]: This sounds very luminous.

1166
01:09:49,405 --> 01:09:52,488
[SPEAKER_07]: This could totally be inluminous.

1167
01:09:52,508 --> 01:09:54,350
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole series isn't animated like this though.

1168
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:57,178
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the regular style.

1169
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: was there anything else to say about this?

1170
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,142
[SPEAKER_03]: she shoots the shit monster in the face

1171
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:51,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I dug the kind of the swing music for Space Channel 5.

1172
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:58,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I dig it too, but like, you know, I want something a little cross between like Rez, Children of Eden with, you know, like Space Channel 5.

1173
01:10:58,536 --> 01:11:04,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Less of the psychedelic stuff, but, you know, still that kind of high energy type of game.

1174
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:09,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't know if a lot of people get into the swing stuff, although I totally dig the old soundtrack, but...

1175
01:11:10,902 --> 01:11:11,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see something like that.

1176
01:11:12,223 --> 01:11:13,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Just really off the wall.

1177
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:16,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, I don't think it will have that same theme.

1178
01:11:16,987 --> 01:11:18,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know.

1179
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:27,055
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little inappropriate for us rude Americans that don't understand the finer things in life.

1180
01:11:27,095 --> 01:11:29,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It really isn't that far away from Bayonetta.

1181
01:11:29,257 --> 01:11:30,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying.

1182
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:33,701
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a game I need to go back and finish.

1183
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:37,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, when Alan first explained that to me, I was like, is this a sequel to Bayonetta?

1184
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:37,584
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?

1185
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:40,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Banna is so awesome.

1186
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:42,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, DarkSakura, UK releases.

1187
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1188
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:47,975
[SPEAKER_07]: UK releases take us like an hour on this show.

1189
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:50,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I speak now, please?

1190
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:51,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you can.

1191
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:58,778
[SPEAKER_03]: For the UK, on the 12th, we have Arcania, Gothic 4, and EverQuest, House of Thul.

1192
01:11:59,678 --> 01:12:00,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Thul.

1193
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:01,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Thul!

1194
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1195
01:12:03,161 --> 01:12:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, LEGO Universe, Pinball FX 2.

1196
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:08,425
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 13th is Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Episode 1.

1197
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:13,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 15th is Alan Wake, The Rider, and Medal of Honor.

1198
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:17,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Naruto, Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2.

1199
01:12:17,591 --> 01:12:17,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1200
01:12:20,453 --> 01:12:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1201
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I have to say about Naruto games.

1202
01:12:24,856 --> 01:12:26,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Of which there are always plenty.

1203
01:12:27,358 --> 01:12:27,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1204
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:29,360
[SPEAKER_03]: It wins a poopy.

1205
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:30,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1206
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:32,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what do you got for us in gaming news?

1207
01:12:32,202 --> 01:12:34,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimate Ninja 2 is actually really awesome.

1208
01:12:35,304 --> 01:12:36,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you've seen it.

1209
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like an interactive anime.

1210
01:12:40,095 --> 01:12:40,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1211
01:13:04,218 --> 01:13:07,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so other stuff that's not Naruto related, of course.

1212
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:14,982
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of odd to be hearing a first-party company say, but apparently Nintendo is saying, hey, you know what?

1213
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:18,144
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't blame piracy for poor game sales.

1214
01:13:18,564 --> 01:13:22,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least they're saying you can't blame piracy completely for poor game sales.

1215
01:13:24,626 --> 01:13:29,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we should attribute bad software sales solely to piracy.

1216
01:13:31,109 --> 01:13:38,872
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking a little bit about, this was I guess during a Q&A session I guess last week when they were talking about the 3DS pricing and stuff like that.

1217
01:13:39,372 --> 01:13:48,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true there's always an influence of piracy, but it's important for us to increase the number of our consumers who are willing to shell out their money to purchase our products.

1218
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:52,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do not intend to think that slower sales are solely due to piracy.

1219
01:13:53,177 --> 01:14:02,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of agree with them because a lot of people out there, you know, people that pirate games aren't necessarily people that buy games.

1220
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:14,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you lose a sale to someone pirating a game doesn't mean you're actually going to lose a sale, you know, a physical copy sale because they were never going to purchase a copy of the game in the first place.

1221
01:14:15,382 --> 01:14:17,783
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkToagak in our chat room is saying, Nintendo's saying that?

1222
01:14:17,843 --> 01:14:18,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullshit.

1223
01:14:18,443 --> 01:14:19,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1224
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:24,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but it was Iwata that said that, so.

1225
01:14:25,144 --> 01:14:26,824
[SPEAKER_07]: What, and it was a magazine interview?

1226
01:14:26,844 --> 01:14:27,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I missed the source.

1227
01:14:27,584 --> 01:14:28,824
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this was, it wasn't a magazine interview.

1228
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:32,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It was during, I guess a live interview during their Nintendo conference thing.

1229
01:14:32,685 --> 01:14:32,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1230
01:14:32,805 --> 01:14:35,226
[SPEAKER_08]: When they were talking about like the 3DS pricing and stuff like that.

1231
01:14:35,386 --> 01:14:36,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right, okay.

1232
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:38,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um.

1233
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:46,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, you're kind of right in that regard that I think the people who pirate games aren't usually the ones who are going to run to the store and buy them anyway.

1234
01:14:46,496 --> 01:14:50,557
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing I do kind of see as a problem... Not that it excuses it.

1235
01:14:50,637 --> 01:14:51,557
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it doesn't excuse it.

1236
01:14:51,937 --> 01:15:04,720
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think, for example, like on the Wii and stuff, a lot of the games that are more niche or adult and stuff don't seem to do as well as, say, some of the games that most people would be like, why is that selling so much?

1237
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,421
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a shitty-ass party game.

1238
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,721
[SPEAKER_08]: But people buy that stuff.

1239
01:15:09,022 --> 01:15:14,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like Just Dance, a game that when it first came out, I'm like, this is stupid.

1240
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:26,147
[SPEAKER_07]: and then it's just at the top of the charts and then you play it and you're like wow this is actually kind of fun I had people come up to me at work who knew I had a video game addiction and asked me if I've ever played it because they had and they had so much fun with it and I'm thinking like really?

1241
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:41,952
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird the thing about Just Dance though and it's kind of funny is you know that Michael Jackson experience it's pretty much the same game but that has also karaoke in there as well if you want to otherwise it's Just Dance, Michael Jackson that's basically what that is

1242
01:15:42,492 --> 01:15:59,380
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's probably part of the agreement with the Michael Jackson camp or whatever you call it that they can't put Michael Jackson's name below the title of the game like like probably like when Beatles rock band came out there's no way they were gonna call that game rock band Beatles it was always the Beatles rock band yeah you know I mean

1243
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:01,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the same thing with Michael Jackson

1244
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:43,246
[SPEAKER_08]: except Dance Central and what I like about Dance Central a little bit more than say Just Dance is Dance Central first off can read your whole body it's not just reading the sensor so for example if you want to play Just Dance and kind of cheat at it you just do what they're doing with your one hand holding your remote your right hand you just do what they're doing on the screen you don't have to really do the rest of it

1245
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:44,126
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1246
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:32,066
[SPEAKER_08]: so I think that's kind of neat there but yeah it's games like that that kind of appeal to the mass audience that seem to do well and then on the Wii or on the DS poor sales I mean a lot of that can be attributed to the games themselves because there's a lot of junk on the DS a lot of junk and unfortunately a lot of good games out there just kind of get ignored because of all the junk that's out there

1247
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:35,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey man, don't you want to pre-order your copy?

1248
01:17:56,261 --> 01:17:57,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you look like a man on the mission.

1249
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:59,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything I can help you find?

1250
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,962
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just looking around, killing time for my pizza.

1251
01:18:02,162 --> 01:18:02,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a good idea.

1252
01:18:04,862 --> 01:18:05,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I thought so too.

1253
01:18:05,943 --> 01:18:07,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's why I'm here.

1254
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I thought sitting around at a pizza place sucks.

1255
01:18:10,283 --> 01:18:14,984
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but there was a kid walking around and he's like, is Far Cry Predator a good game?

1256
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:19,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just like, well, that came out a while ago.

1257
01:18:19,505 --> 01:18:21,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And besides, you're like 10.

1258
01:18:22,005 --> 01:18:23,526
[SPEAKER_08]: You shouldn't be playing a mature rated game.

1259
01:18:23,546 --> 01:18:25,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Because your parents don't care.

1260
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:27,621
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but when we were young... Oh, God.

1261
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:28,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1262
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:36,291
[SPEAKER_07]: When we were young and playing those 8-bit Nintendo games, there was a lot of crap that we liked that I bet a lot of people kind of looked at and went, boy, this is not a good game.

1263
01:18:36,492 --> 01:18:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: But see, a lot of the focus, though, was about games being fun.

1264
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:45,923
[SPEAKER_08]: See, now... And now, I get it that there's a lot of that stuff out there now that...

1265
01:18:48,243 --> 01:18:51,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, back in our day, there was also educational games and stuff like that, too.

1266
01:18:51,948 --> 01:18:54,612
[SPEAKER_08]: But we were smart enough to know, okay, that's an educational game.

1267
01:18:54,853 --> 01:18:56,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not touching that shit.

1268
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless it was Oregon Trail or Number Munchers.

1269
01:19:00,256 --> 01:19:03,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, well that stuff was force-fed onto us, you know, at an early age.

1270
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we just adapted to it.

1271
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:11,766
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm saying, like, you know, with... There's a lot of educational product out there on the DS.

1272
01:19:11,786 --> 01:19:13,527
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of crappy licensed games.

1273
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:16,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a lot of crappy licensed games even on the NES.

1274
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:17,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Although Cool Spot was awesome.

1275
01:19:18,512 --> 01:19:19,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And Yonoid wasn't that bad.

1276
01:19:20,253 --> 01:19:21,954
[SPEAKER_08]: So they could pull it off back then.

1277
01:19:21,974 --> 01:19:25,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just now, unfortunately, it's all about the license and not about the gameplay.

1278
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:36,882
[SPEAKER_08]: as you know they have the Jelly Belly puzzle game and the still waiting for my Kill Bill video game that's all I'm saying never gonna happen

1279
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:37,928
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1280
01:20:06,642 --> 01:20:07,543
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1281
01:20:28,712 --> 01:20:41,396
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get three versions, you'll get a special call-out on the Sega blogs and the Sonic 4 website's news feed and special placement in one very cool spot to be revealed.

1282
01:20:43,337 --> 01:20:43,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

1283
01:20:44,517 --> 01:20:47,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you get all four versions, so meaning what?

1284
01:20:47,618 --> 01:20:49,499
[SPEAKER_07]: $15 on the PS3, $15 on the 360, $15 on the Wii, and what?

1285
01:20:49,559 --> 01:20:50,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Another $10 on the iPhone, right?

1286
01:20:53,160 --> 01:21:05,290
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you buy all four versions, you will be featured in a special video shout-out from Aaron Weber, who's the Sega Community Manager and the Brand Manager for Sonic 4, Ken Balo.

1287
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:11,795
[SPEAKER_07]: That video will be posted on Sega's YouTube page and all across Sega realms here on the internets.

1288
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:14,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the exact quote, here on the internets.

1289
01:21:15,898 --> 01:21:16,419
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1290
01:21:16,499 --> 01:21:20,302
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be internet famous if you drop $55 on Sonic 4.

1291
01:21:20,702 --> 01:21:21,823
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you say, DarkSakura?

1292
01:21:22,163 --> 01:21:22,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's buy them all.

1293
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:23,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1294
01:21:23,955 --> 01:21:28,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the enthusiasm.

1295
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:31,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what do you think?

1296
01:21:31,337 --> 01:21:32,637
[SPEAKER_07]: You gonna buy them all to get mentioned?

1297
01:21:32,657 --> 01:21:33,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm buying none of them.

1298
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw you, Sega.

1299
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:42,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need you to say my name, you know, in order to feel special.

1300
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:44,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee in our chat says, the call out?

1301
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for nothing, fool.

1302
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Salacious Pop says, wow, no one cur.

1303
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,922
[SPEAKER_07]: and Actdeft says, my name featured on a sticky thread.

1304
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:54,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1305
01:21:57,283 --> 01:21:57,924
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the thing.

1306
01:21:58,644 --> 01:22:01,966
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in a sticky thread, but who the fuck's going to read the sticky thread?

1307
01:22:02,546 --> 01:22:04,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, look, Bob's name's on there.

1308
01:22:04,668 --> 01:22:07,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Way to go, Bob, purchasing two copies of the game.

1309
01:22:07,949 --> 01:22:08,750
[SPEAKER_08]: You're an idiot.

1310
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:15,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder though if they say the special placement in one very cool spot for buying three versions.

1311
01:22:16,273 --> 01:22:20,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if that's in the credits of Sonic 4 Part 2.

1312
01:22:20,395 --> 01:22:21,316
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably what it is.

1313
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:22,416
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still dumb.

1314
01:22:23,537 --> 01:22:25,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you want your name in a video game?

1315
01:22:28,179 --> 01:22:33,801
[SPEAKER_08]: It should reward you with Episode 2 instead of just... Oh, so like incentives.

1316
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:37,383
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already spoiled who the main character of Episode 2 is going to be.

1317
01:22:37,885 --> 01:22:40,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, are you going to spoil it for all our listeners?

1318
01:22:41,227 --> 01:22:44,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what the character's name is because once again, I don't follow Sonic.

1319
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:47,231
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a stupid Sonic robot thing.

1320
01:22:47,691 --> 01:22:51,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Metal Sonic, but it's the one with, he has a spiky nose.

1321
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:55,376
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my wonderful description of the Sonic character.

1322
01:22:55,676 --> 01:23:00,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, if you want your name in a thread, just post in that thread.

1323
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,201
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea.

1324
01:23:04,181 --> 01:23:07,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to start, no, I'm not going to do that because that would require effort.

1325
01:23:07,283 --> 01:23:14,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, someone should start a thread on that same forum of people who put their names in who haven't bought any copies of it.

1326
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:21,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Defective Candy in our chatroom says, maybe you guys could say, hey, give me five bucks and we'll stick your name to the top of the OLR forums.

1327
01:23:22,836 --> 01:23:24,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to, but I don't know.

1328
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:26,338
[SPEAKER_07]: That just seems really wrong to me.

1329
01:23:26,398 --> 01:23:27,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just really wrong.

1330
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:33,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in our chat says, Loki, Sky, and Jamie need to buy one each and get OLR mentioned, though.

1331
01:23:33,664 --> 01:23:36,145
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not buying a copy of that.

1332
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:38,045
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy three and get OLR mentioned.

1333
01:23:38,825 --> 01:23:39,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1334
01:23:40,585 --> 01:23:42,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to submit a fake name.

1335
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:45,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, Bonnie Von Fluffles or something like that.

1336
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:47,607
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like, submit fake names.

1337
01:23:47,627 --> 01:23:50,087
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be funny to get this community manager to say.

1338
01:23:50,627 --> 01:23:51,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Sassy Pants Fuzzy Bottom?

1339
01:23:51,988 --> 01:23:52,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1340
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that idea.

1341
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:57,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And big shout out to Sassy Pants Fuzzy Bottom.

1342
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:00,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1343
01:24:02,491 --> 01:24:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a look in gaming's history and the way things used to be in a better time.

1344
01:24:08,495 --> 01:24:09,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the classic game of the week.

1345
01:24:09,996 --> 01:24:18,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the part of our show where DarkSakura goes into the vault and says, Hey, I'm going to find a game that these kids should be playing.

1346
01:24:19,242 --> 01:24:23,024
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week for these little brats who don't know better?

1347
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:25,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic game is Final Fantasy V. Yay.

1348
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:27,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1349
01:24:30,907 --> 01:24:34,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked boss music because I couldn't find anything else.

1350
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:36,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a game by Square.

1351
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:36,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Came out in 1992.

1352
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:41,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only out in Japan for the longest time on the Super Famicom.

1353
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's super fun.

1354
01:24:45,477 --> 01:24:52,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It stars a guy named Bartz, who actually, for the longest time, it was Buttz.

1355
01:24:54,443 --> 01:24:57,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I used to laugh, but anyway.

1356
01:24:58,704 --> 01:25:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: A meteor falls and he goes to check it out and then, oh noes, we need the crystals.

1357
01:25:04,286 --> 01:25:10,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to seal Exdeath, which is the coolest name for a bad guy in a series ever.

1358
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:12,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Exdeath.

1359
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:13,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't you be afraid, Rob?

1360
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:16,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be afraid of Exdeath.

1361
01:25:17,717 --> 01:25:19,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the cool thing about this game is the job system.

1362
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:28,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You get your experience point and you battle monsters and stuff like any Final Fantasy game.

1363
01:25:28,246 --> 01:25:34,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a chocobo and you get a ship and an airship and you do different stuff.

1364
01:25:35,311 --> 01:25:49,154
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second one that uses the active time battle, where time will flow continuously for both players and enemies, which was first in Final Fantasy IV, which was 2 when it came out over here.

1365
01:25:49,294 --> 01:25:57,676
[SPEAKER_03]: The job system, though, is a really cool thing, because you can gain different special abilities and sort of mix up your jobs.

1366
01:25:58,756 --> 01:26:02,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You get ability points, so you increase the job levels for different characters.

1367
01:26:03,717 --> 01:26:14,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also say, say you have a knight who also has white magic levels, well then you become a paladin, for an example.

1368
01:26:16,028 --> 01:26:19,792
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also the game that introduced the blue mage, the time mage, and the mime.

1369
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:23,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we have them in other Final Fantasy games.

1370
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:26,474
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really cool game.

1371
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:27,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It had lots of cool characters.

1372
01:26:27,895 --> 01:26:32,680
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Lena, Bartz, Forrest, Kreel.

1373
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:33,921
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really cool.

1374
01:26:35,082 --> 01:26:38,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a reoccurring boss, which is what this music is, is Gilgamesh.

1375
01:26:40,067 --> 01:26:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Always Gilgamesh.

1376
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of Gilgamesh battles.

1377
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's a pretty cool game.

1378
01:26:45,032 --> 01:26:52,478
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't played it yet, for the longest time you can only play it if you either had the cartridge or had a really good emulator.

1379
01:26:53,238 --> 01:26:54,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Read Japanese or it was translated.

1380
01:26:56,241 --> 01:26:56,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool.

1381
01:26:58,062 --> 01:27:03,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also one of... And your microphone failed at this game.

1382
01:27:03,907 --> 01:27:04,567
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1383
01:27:05,328 --> 01:27:05,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear me.

1384
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:07,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I can.

1385
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:07,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1386
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:07,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1387
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:14,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as I was saying, it's one of the ones that was directed by Sakaguchi, sorry.

1388
01:27:14,936 --> 01:27:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is his favorite Final Fantasy game.

1389
01:27:18,259 --> 01:27:22,584
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the character designs, logo, everything was done by Amano.

1390
01:27:23,244 --> 01:27:24,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoshitaka Amano, who is my hero.

1391
01:27:26,347 --> 01:27:29,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And the battle graphics were done by Nomura.

1392
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:30,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

1393
01:27:32,533 --> 01:27:32,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1394
01:27:34,895 --> 01:27:35,956
[SPEAKER_03]: MAMBO DE CHOCOPO

1395
01:27:57,694 --> 01:27:59,595
[SPEAKER_03]: We have since seen it elsewhere.

1396
01:28:00,235 --> 01:28:05,056
[SPEAKER_03]: It's come out on the PlayStation in Japan.

1397
01:28:05,836 --> 01:28:10,018
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Final Fantasy collection that came out over here that had Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 6 on it.

1398
01:28:10,738 --> 01:28:12,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a full motion video opening.

1399
01:28:13,259 --> 01:28:13,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1400
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:23,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had the Final Fantasy Anthology also on the PlayStation.

1401
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:25,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1402
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:33,613
[SPEAKER_03]: They, uh, that's why they, uh, where they changed the name to, uh, Bart.

1403
01:28:36,876 --> 01:28:38,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gil instead of Guido.

1404
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:42,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was PlayStation 2 release.

1405
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:44,622
[SPEAKER_03]: There was...

1406
01:28:48,401 --> 01:28:49,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Boy Advance release.

1407
01:28:50,403 --> 01:28:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an extra level and a new boss.

1408
01:28:55,346 --> 01:28:57,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were designed by Amano.

1409
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:00,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was Final Fantasy V Advance.

1410
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really cool.

1411
01:29:05,032 --> 01:29:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, however, an anime that was called Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystals.

1412
01:29:09,355 --> 01:29:10,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an OAV.

1413
01:29:11,216 --> 01:29:12,417
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done by Studio Madhouse.

1414
01:29:13,418 --> 01:29:16,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the sequel to Final Fantasy V.

1415

[SPEAKER_07]: there you go alright your classic game of the week boys and girls Final Fantasy 5 the one that was just too cool for America for so many years but finally Square came to their damn senses so there it is

1428
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:52,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Let it loose, baby

1429
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:26,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can just hear the epic epicness in it.

1430
01:31:26,602 --> 01:31:28,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the music on the title screen, which is...

1431
01:31:33,289 --> 01:31:34,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I love the Civilization series.

1432
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I say?

1433
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:36,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I have yet to check out 5, though.

1434
01:31:37,012 --> 01:31:44,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all part of that whole, like, I spent all my money on Disneyland this month, so I haven't purchased a lot of games, but that's one of the ones I've got to look into getting, for sure.

1435
01:31:45,116 --> 01:31:46,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll see.

1436
01:31:47,518 --> 01:31:49,739
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, things going on this week.

1437
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:53,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what is happening this Wednesday?

1438
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:54,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what this Wednesday is?

1439
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday is a very important day for me.

1440
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:57,924
[SPEAKER_07]: It is October 13th.

1441
01:31:58,184 --> 01:31:58,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone?

1442
01:31:58,824 --> 01:31:59,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone?

1443
01:31:59,985 --> 01:32:01,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It is my... You all right?

1444
01:32:02,887 --> 01:32:03,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to answer.

1445
01:32:03,748 --> 01:32:05,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because you know I told you before the show.

1446
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:05,449
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1447
01:32:05,709 --> 01:32:07,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my 10-year anniversary of playing DDR.

1448
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:08,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1449
01:32:08,811 --> 01:32:16,976
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 years ago on October the 13th was the first day I ever played DDR, which might not seem like a big deal to all of you because like, oh, hey, dancing, arrow stomping game, ha-ha, funny.

1450
01:32:17,336 --> 01:32:20,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it weren't for DDR, this show wouldn't exist.

1451
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:22,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably would not know Jamie or Matt if it weren't for DDR.

1452
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:27,122
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably would have ran into each other in some nerd circle one way or another, but it just would not have happened the same way.

1453
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:27,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1454
01:32:28,623 --> 01:32:41,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week on the program, to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of me playing DDR, we've actually invited a guest who was there that night because it was her first time ever playing DDR.

1455
01:32:41,886 --> 01:32:43,626
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to be here next week on the show.

1456
01:32:44,046 --> 01:32:47,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica Harper from Understation Live is going to be here in the house.

1457
01:32:47,407 --> 01:32:52,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys know her as Iguana Girl, one of the admins of DDR Freak for, I believe, a couple years.

1458
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:54,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So she has a lot of Ditter history.

1459
01:32:54,948 --> 01:32:55,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be good times.

1460
01:32:55,829 --> 01:32:57,129
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have her on the show.

1461
01:32:58,009 --> 01:33:04,311
[SPEAKER_07]: and kind of look back on DDR and video games at large because I know she plays some other video games too so we're going to have a good time next week.

1462
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:09,593
[SPEAKER_07]: See, Travis says I don't love Under Station Live enough sometimes but you know what?

1463
01:33:09,613 --> 01:33:12,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have one of the hosts right here on the show so it'll be a good time.

1464
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,135
[SPEAKER_07]: This is heart, heart, heart, heart, love.

1465
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:14,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1466
01:33:14,995 --> 01:33:15,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Heart, heart, heart, love.

1467
01:33:16,516 --> 01:33:16,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1468
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:19,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's welcome to come out here anytime he wants.

1469
01:33:19,237 --> 01:33:19,717
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1470
01:33:19,757 --> 01:33:24,018
[SPEAKER_07]: If Travis wants to fly his ass out to Sacramento, he's welcome to come on the show anytime.

1471
01:33:24,819 --> 01:33:25,119
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1472
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Loomy's in our chatroom says, did you lose a lot of weight during those 10 years playing DDR?

1473
01:33:32,062 --> 01:33:32,402
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1474
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:34,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Not now.

1475
01:33:34,783 --> 01:33:37,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I was playing as much DDR as I was back then because that would help.

1476
01:33:37,924 --> 01:33:38,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1477
01:33:38,524 --> 01:33:39,285
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1478
01:33:59,443 --> 01:34:00,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That is terrible.

1479
01:34:00,324 --> 01:34:06,750
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be like, surprise, cow brains, or surprise, it's the uterus of a duck, you know, or something like that.

1480
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:07,311
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1481
01:34:07,331 --> 01:34:08,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Dan's had a cow brain dinner.

1482
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:13,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I never heard you complaining when I stuffed cow brains in the uterus of a duck and fried it, okay?

1483
01:34:16,147 --> 01:34:19,689
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I eat double bacon pizzas Which is funny because now I'm mostly vegetarian

1484
01:34:37,293 --> 01:34:40,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're the one that's actually lost the weight since those days.

1485
01:34:40,335 --> 01:34:44,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you guys need to stop being vegetarian because I have to eat more meat to compensate.

1486
01:34:45,499 --> 01:34:46,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not vegetarian.

1487
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm whatever.

1488
01:34:48,301 --> 01:34:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I eat meat like once a month.

1489
01:34:51,104 --> 01:34:52,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1490
01:34:52,344 --> 01:34:54,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, like cow flesh.

1491
01:34:54,758 --> 01:35:00,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll talk more about all that and that stuff in a future episode next week.

1492
01:35:00,522 --> 01:35:02,083
[SPEAKER_07]: We have skinny raw pictures up there, I guess.

1493
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:08,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, Jessica dug up like hecka old pictures on Facebook and found, I gotta see which one she put up there.

1494
01:35:09,428 --> 01:35:09,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1495
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:14,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week's going to be a fun show.

1496
01:35:15,232 --> 01:35:18,454
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of me playing Magenta at the Rocky Horror Picture Show, yes.

1497
01:35:18,895 --> 01:35:19,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Jessica.

1498
01:35:19,815 --> 01:35:20,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much for that.

1499
01:35:20,596 --> 01:35:21,396
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1500
01:35:22,197 --> 01:35:23,217
[SPEAKER_07]: You were so gorgeous.

1501
01:35:24,318 --> 01:35:25,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

1502
01:35:25,099 --> 01:35:28,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to gaming news and all that fun stuff here.

1503
01:35:29,201 --> 01:35:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want to talk more about Robin Address.

1504
01:35:31,023 --> 01:35:31,823
[SPEAKER_07]: No, let's not.

1505
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to give people the wrong impression.

1506
01:35:34,285 --> 01:35:34,905
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Rocky Horror.

1507
01:35:34,925 --> 01:35:35,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different.

1508
01:35:35,806 --> 01:35:36,847
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1509
01:35:37,027 --> 01:35:40,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news, please.

1510
01:35:41,009 --> 01:35:51,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, during releases this week, I mentioned that the Gears of War, that'd be funny, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition is going to be coming out.

1511
01:35:52,477 --> 01:36:07,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And, well, what's kind of neat about it is they just announced that the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands, and this pisses me off because I bought most of the download content on its own, will be coming with not only all the download content for Borderlands, but early access to Duke Nukem Forever.

1512
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:10,073
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, the demo.

1513
01:36:11,154 --> 01:36:14,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So even more incentive to spend $60 on a game most of you already have.

1514
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:15,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1515
01:36:16,802 --> 01:36:17,603
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I want that demo.

1516
01:36:17,823 --> 01:36:18,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what though?

1517
01:36:19,685 --> 01:36:25,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Me being me, that demo will leak out and I'll build a download, so I don't care.

1518
01:36:26,193 --> 01:36:26,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you special?

1519
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I am faithful I'm thinking about, I don't know how much I'd like Borderlands But I hear it's like a first person World of Warcraft with guns Borderlands is fun It's like, yeah, it's a first person shooter But it's kind of a little bit of an RPG And there's a lot of, like, you know Looting, I guess So if you like loot It's a little bit like Diablo, I guess I like the phase walker girl She's pretty cool Yes, she is pretty awesome

1520
01:36:57,597 --> 01:36:58,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Hunter, Mordecai, Raven of Death

1521
01:37:09,548 --> 01:37:13,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, damn it, I got Borderlands on Steam for $10 US.

1522
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:18,511
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they put it on sale right before all these announcements.

1523
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:21,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jessica's linking more old pictures of me.

1524
01:37:21,372 --> 01:37:27,333
[SPEAKER_07]: She linked this one of me dressed up as Brad for the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Izam in our chatroom.

1525
01:37:27,414 --> 01:37:28,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I said that right.

1526
01:37:28,174 --> 01:37:28,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Izam?

1527
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:28,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Izam?

1528
01:37:29,034 --> 01:37:29,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Izam?

1529
01:37:29,614 --> 01:37:31,835
[SPEAKER_07]: In our chatroom says, for a second I thought it was What the Buck.

1530
01:37:32,575 --> 01:37:35,296
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Hero 2 is coming out soon in a couple weeks

1531
01:37:59,065 --> 01:37:59,486
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Hero 2 Bundles

1532
01:38:16,963 --> 01:38:26,645
[SPEAKER_08]: which, by the way, they are selling the original game by itself in case you want to build your own bundle over here in the U.S.

1533
01:38:27,785 --> 01:38:31,186
[SPEAKER_08]: for another $50, which is kind of a ripoff if you ask me.

1534
01:38:31,806 --> 01:38:38,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe, though, if you preorder through Toys R Us, which no one's really doing that anymore because Toys R Us is almost out of business.

1535
01:38:40,388 --> 01:38:40,668
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my

1536
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:42,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was supposed to be a cheap place to get diapers.

1537
01:38:42,429 --> 01:38:43,690
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no cheap place to get diapers.

1538
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if you pre-order there, you also get a free copy of the game.

1539
01:38:45,771 --> 01:38:46,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So it might be something to keep in mind.

1540
01:39:04,838 --> 01:39:16,689
[SPEAKER_08]: And then last but not least, with the release of the new Mario Anniversary Edition, which, by the way, is just Mario All-Stars, but on the Wii now.

1541
01:39:18,691 --> 01:39:20,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Not with extra Mario games or anything, right?

1542
01:39:20,753 --> 01:39:21,414
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not with anything.

1543
01:39:21,434 --> 01:39:23,055
[SPEAKER_07]: A port of the Super Nintendo.

1544
01:39:23,075 --> 01:39:24,657
[SPEAKER_07]: A straight-ass port of the Nintendo game.

1545
01:39:24,677 --> 01:39:26,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not even the one that comes with Mario World, is it?

1546
01:39:26,438 --> 01:39:29,261
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, something that they could have, I don't know, put on Virtual Console...

1547
01:39:30,302 --> 01:39:30,702
[SPEAKER_08]: for like $10.

1548
01:39:31,283 --> 01:39:33,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe that's what they'll do here in the U.S.

1549
01:39:33,345 --> 01:39:35,166
[SPEAKER_07]: because we haven't heard anything about this coming to the U.S., right?

1550
01:39:35,186 --> 01:39:36,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it'll come to the U.S.

1551
01:39:36,788 --> 01:39:37,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I guarantee it.

1552
01:39:37,829 --> 01:39:43,213
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can charge $50 for something that's really worth $10, yeah, they'll bring it out over here.

1553
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:54,043
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously, Nintendo, we've gotten into this conversation about how Nintendo doesn't really... They do make new stuff now, but a lot of the stuff that they put out, like, hey, look, new Mario game.

1554
01:39:54,844 --> 01:39:55,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really new.

1555
01:39:55,865 --> 01:39:56,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

1556
01:39:57,606 --> 01:39:58,126
[SPEAKER_08]: and many more.

1557
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:25,780
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, great, now you're making me feel awful because I want this so bad.

1558
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You are an awful person if you want this so bad.

1559
01:40:28,261 --> 01:40:28,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it.

1560
01:40:28,701 --> 01:40:29,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it.

1561
01:40:29,321 --> 01:40:31,382
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't even change the color of the light in the front.

1562
01:40:31,402 --> 01:40:33,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can change that to like red or something, you know?

1563
01:40:33,882 --> 01:40:35,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a collector's thing.

1564
01:40:35,303 --> 01:40:35,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1565
01:40:35,823 --> 01:40:36,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stupid.

1566
01:40:36,703 --> 01:40:37,323
[SPEAKER_03]: What if he doesn't have a Wii?

1567
01:40:37,363 --> 01:40:39,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it should have a Mario graphic on it.

1568
01:40:39,944 --> 01:40:40,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it should have at least a Mario.

1569
01:40:40,744 --> 01:40:43,965
[SPEAKER_07]: They should put something, silkscreen some fucking shit on there.

1570
01:40:45,826 --> 01:40:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: We want stickers.

1571
01:40:46,726 --> 01:40:47,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Pimp my Wii.

1572
01:40:47,986 --> 01:40:48,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Pimp my Wii.

1573
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:49,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1574
01:40:49,447 --> 01:40:49,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1575
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:53,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so Loki will not be pre-ordering one of these.

1576
01:40:53,931 --> 01:41:06,478
[SPEAKER_08]: No, why would I want... Yeah, let me import a console from Japan, even though I have a Wii already that I don't play anything on, and then, you know, ooh, it's in a wonderful red color that I really don't like.

1577
01:41:06,578 --> 01:41:07,258
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

1578
01:41:07,418 --> 01:41:08,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally gonna put down four.

1579
01:41:10,222 --> 01:41:11,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1580
01:41:29,236 --> 01:41:44,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Gears of War 3 is going to be coming out in the fall of 2011 so the beta will be out sometime in the spring maybe they haven't said exactly when next year they've just said next year there will be a beta so you guys can completely base your judgments of the game off a beta because it's what a lot of people do

1581
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:49,560
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet 2 also delayed until next year.

1582
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not as late next year.

1583
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:54,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm hearing it's just going to be January.

1584
01:41:54,682 --> 01:41:58,923
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not going to actually release it this year in time for the holidays.

1585
01:41:59,303 --> 01:42:02,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why, they don't want launch day passes.

1586
01:42:03,274 --> 01:42:03,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Patches?

1587
01:42:03,694 --> 01:42:04,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Patches.

1588
01:42:04,095 --> 01:42:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I say patches?

1589
01:42:04,915 --> 01:42:05,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Patches.

1590
01:42:05,876 --> 01:42:07,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, we could have shipped it and it would have been fine.

1591
01:42:08,057 --> 01:42:11,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a quote from the head of Media Molecule, Alex Evans.

1592
01:42:11,779 --> 01:42:19,644
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we realized that with just a couple extra weeks we could make the game super amazing, adding the super onto the already amazing which exists today.

1593
01:42:19,964 --> 01:42:23,326
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that will live forever and the delay people will forget about.

1594
01:42:23,687 --> 01:42:27,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of like that he says that because that's a point we've brought up on the show before.

1595
01:42:27,949 --> 01:42:28,910
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't forget.

1596
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:58,676
[SPEAKER_07]: oftentimes that these games were delayed if they were that good like for example Mario Brothers Melee Super Smash Brothers Melee or whatever the one on the Wii I was delayed like five times and people kind of just forgot by the time the game actually came out you know what though I'm saying this is a good thing this is a good deal if it keeps the game in good quality just like some of these other delays we've been hearing about it's very interesting though that always at the end of the year delay delay delay

1597
01:42:59,076 --> 01:43:11,206
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great that they're putting it out so that we don't have any day one patches because those people that don't have their PlayStations connected to the PlayStation Network anymore because of USB devices that they're using with their PlayStation 3.

1598
01:43:12,367 --> 01:43:13,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And one more for me.

1599
01:43:14,509 --> 01:43:17,011
[SPEAKER_07]: This is about a new Shenmue game.

1600
01:43:17,511 --> 01:43:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1601
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:21,314
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a new Shenmue game coming out.

1602
01:43:21,715 --> 01:43:24,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out in Japan this year.

1603
01:43:25,703 --> 01:43:29,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Shenmue Town is coming out on Yahoo Japan.

1604
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:31,690
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, no frumping over there.

1605
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:35,332
[SPEAKER_07]: But sorry, it's not the game you were hoping I was going to mention here on the show.

1606
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:01,514
[SPEAKER_07]: SadTuba Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1607
01:44:02,492 --> 01:44:03,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff and things.

1608
01:44:04,213 --> 01:44:06,735
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Mega Man stuff?

1609
01:44:07,455 --> 01:44:09,137
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a comic out.

1610
01:44:09,797 --> 01:44:11,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being put out by Archie Comics.

1611
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are saying it's going to be faithful to continuity, so hopefully.

1612
01:44:18,463 --> 01:44:25,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, they also did that Sonic the Hedgehog one that I didn't think was very good, nor the Knights one wasn't good at all.

1613
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:31,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is written by Ian Flynn, who's currently writing Sonic the Hedgehog.

1614
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't really have high hopes for it.

1615
01:44:35,794 --> 01:44:37,234
[SPEAKER_03]: The art looks interesting.

1616
01:44:38,555 --> 01:44:41,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Proto Man looks really freaking cool, but I don't know.

1617
01:44:41,717 --> 01:44:42,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be okay.

1618
01:44:44,418 --> 01:44:45,479
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see when it comes out.

1619
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other news, Typing of the Dead.

1620
01:44:52,362 --> 01:44:53,743
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a new version!

1621
01:44:54,283 --> 01:44:55,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1622
01:44:56,404 --> 01:44:59,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Typing of the Dead featuring Mina no Shuko...

1623
01:45:00,726 --> 01:45:02,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be helpful if I could pronounce this properly.

1624
01:45:03,328 --> 01:45:12,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Featuring Mina no Shushoku Katsudoniki, which is pretty much the Dreamcast version with new words.

1625
01:45:14,914 --> 01:45:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Except these look like they're... It says, Everyone's Job Hunting Diary.

1626
01:45:19,977 --> 01:45:25,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a job hunting site in Japan?

1627
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:25,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1628
01:45:27,403 --> 01:45:47,229
[SPEAKER_03]: That they've teamed up with Interesting So it's like If they were to make a game These are mini games These are mini games in job hunting mode So you can type in words like Disability income And stagnant air Interesting, huh?

1629
01:45:49,219 --> 01:46:18,452
[SPEAKER_03]: these people never get a job if they're just playing games all the time and last but not least is more Marvel vs. Capcom 3 stuff we have new characters we have Sir Arthur and Nathan Spencer Arthur being from Ghosts and Goblins which we talked about in part A and Nathan Spencer is from the 3D one I'm trying to see what this is

1630
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1631
01:46:22,034 --> 01:46:22,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1632
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:25,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

1633
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:28,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy about Arthur being in it.

1634
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:28,819
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1635
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also supposed to hear more characters later on.

1636
01:46:34,463 --> 01:46:35,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty neat.

1637
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already heard about the people I care about.

1638
01:46:38,906 --> 01:46:39,166
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1639
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:43,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, looking at Twitter, we're going to go to Twitter.

1640
01:46:43,346 --> 01:46:48,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, real quick, I wanted to mention this because Jessica's in our chat room tonight.

1641
01:46:48,089 --> 01:46:49,150
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to be here on the show next week.

1642
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:53,232
[SPEAKER_07]: She's plugging one of the other hosts on Understation Live, Bress Lowell.

1643
01:46:53,973 --> 01:46:55,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe this is part of Extra Life.

1644
01:46:56,174 --> 01:46:59,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I was participating, playing some video games over the next 24 hours.

1645
01:46:59,856 --> 01:47:01,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, not the next 24 hours, but on the 16th and 17th.

1646
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1647
01:47:24,807 --> 01:47:25,768
[SPEAKER_07]: and donate to somebody.

1648
01:47:25,828 --> 01:47:28,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if it's not Brestle, donate to somebody.

1649
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:31,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good cause and gives gamers a good name.

1650
01:47:31,872 --> 01:47:34,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good fuzzy-wuzzy thing to talk about.

1651
01:47:34,374 --> 01:47:37,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, also, there was a couple other characters that they added to Marvel vs. Capcom.

1652
01:47:38,017 --> 01:47:38,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, what's that?

1653
01:47:38,878 --> 01:47:41,319
[SPEAKER_08]: On top of... Please share.

1654
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:41,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

1655
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Magneto.

1656
01:47:44,101 --> 01:47:45,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

1657
01:47:45,883 --> 01:47:51,307
[SPEAKER_08]: The last one was because I'm not recognizing the character.

1658
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,211
[SPEAKER_03]: MODOK.

1659
01:47:55,811 --> 01:47:58,833
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever see the big giant head thing that's just a little harness?

1660
01:48:00,275 --> 01:48:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That's MODOK.

1661
01:48:02,496 --> 01:48:04,258
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's MODOK from?

1662
01:48:05,019 --> 01:48:07,561
[SPEAKER_03]: From various Marvel comics.

1663
01:48:08,762 --> 01:48:09,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Really annoying character.

1664
01:48:10,003 --> 01:48:10,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like

1665
01:48:13,951 --> 01:48:15,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot what MODOK stands for.

1666
01:48:15,652 --> 01:48:15,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1667
01:48:17,334 --> 01:48:19,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I go to Twitter topics?

1668
01:48:19,615 --> 01:48:20,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweets time?

1669
01:48:21,557 --> 01:48:21,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweeters?

1670
01:48:23,298 --> 01:48:23,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, found it.

1671
01:48:23,979 --> 01:48:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Mental organism designed only for killing.

1672
01:48:26,481 --> 01:48:28,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1673
01:48:29,103 --> 01:48:31,224
[SPEAKER_07]: It's you in a nutshell, says Loki.

1674
01:48:32,786 --> 01:48:35,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, going to our Twitter and looking at some of the topics.

1675
01:48:36,128 --> 01:48:39,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a whole lot tonight, but we will get through some of these here.

1676
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:40,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1677
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, see, this first one here from PopOnJair, or as I like to read his name, PopOnJair.

1678
01:48:48,876 --> 01:48:49,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Popo.

1679
01:48:50,296 --> 01:48:55,478
[SPEAKER_07]: PopOnJair submits us, Surely you've seen this, the most useless game accessory ever, and it's the game boat.

1680
01:48:55,538 --> 01:48:56,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember seeing that on the Twitter.

1681
01:48:57,159 --> 01:48:59,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just love the picture, because it's like the dude, he's on a boat!

1682
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it looks completely useless.

1683
01:49:02,821 --> 01:49:06,803
[SPEAKER_07]: About as useless as that inflatable cart that I still kind of want.

1684
01:49:07,803 --> 01:49:09,023
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that's coming out this week?

1685
01:49:09,224 --> 01:49:09,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1686
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,207
[SPEAKER_07]: MNZiba sends us a tweet.

1687
01:49:13,628 --> 01:49:17,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendogs blamed for an actual dog attack.

1688
01:49:17,944 --> 01:49:19,245
[SPEAKER_07]: How in the hell does this work?

1689
01:49:19,285 --> 01:49:19,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1690
01:49:20,266 --> 01:49:20,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1691
01:49:21,487 --> 01:49:30,836
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the Daily Mail, this is in the UK, Megan Walker was peacefully playing a copy of Nintendogs at a friend's house when one of the in-game dogs barked at her.

1692
01:49:31,476 --> 01:49:36,741
[SPEAKER_07]: But the bark was an earshot of the friend's bull mastiff, a breed of dog that weighs about 130 pounds.

1693
01:49:37,142 --> 01:49:43,207
[SPEAKER_07]: The sound spooked the dog so much that it bit Walker's face, severing a portion of her upper lip.

1694
01:49:44,068 --> 01:49:44,788
[SPEAKER_07]: How sad.

1695
01:49:45,148 --> 01:49:49,370
[SPEAKER_07]: The girl's grandma told the Daily Mail, I think this game should carry some kind of warning.

1696
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:52,411
[SPEAKER_07]: People should be told not to play it when there are dogs in the room.

1697
01:49:52,851 --> 01:49:54,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame the game for what happened to Megan.

1698
01:49:54,412 --> 01:49:55,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Megan will eat your face.

1699
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:58,293
[SPEAKER_07]: If they hadn't been playing it, I don't think the dog would have gone for it.

1700
01:49:58,654 --> 01:49:59,274
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, lady...

1701
01:50:00,154 --> 01:50:03,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you shouldn't keep a 130 pound dog near a 9 year old.

1702
01:50:03,736 --> 01:50:04,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Call it a hunch.

1703
01:50:05,236 --> 01:50:05,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a thought.

1704
01:50:06,237 --> 01:50:08,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Or one that's prone to eating people's faces off.

1705
01:50:08,357 --> 01:50:09,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thinking.

1706
01:50:09,738 --> 01:50:12,979
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a face eating dog, you might want to keep it away from your 9 year old.

1707
01:50:12,999 --> 01:50:15,820
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm right, I think a bull mastiff is the largest breed of dog.

1708
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:16,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Good God.

1709
01:50:17,361 --> 01:50:18,061
[SPEAKER_03]: They're huge.

1710
01:50:18,562 --> 01:50:19,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Crazy lady.

1711
01:50:21,334 --> 01:50:22,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I was bit by a dog when I was five.

1712
01:50:22,595 --> 01:50:23,115
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not fun.

1713
01:50:23,276 --> 01:50:24,176
[SPEAKER_03]: You're afraid of dogs now.

1714
01:50:24,296 --> 01:50:25,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I am, actually.

1715
01:50:25,858 --> 01:50:26,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting better.

1716
01:50:26,999 --> 01:50:29,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to be afraid of all dogs, but now it's just big dogs.

1717
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:32,663
[SPEAKER_07]: If I was around a 130-pound dog, I'd be running the other way.

1718
01:50:32,723 --> 01:50:33,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to lie.

1719
01:50:33,924 --> 01:50:39,489
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm at the point where Alan has talked me into getting a corgi someday.

1720
01:50:39,529 --> 01:50:40,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Corgis are adorable.

1721
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:45,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're little, and they're cute, and they waggle, and that's adorable.

1722
01:50:45,553 --> 01:50:46,914
[SPEAKER_07]: They're super cute.

1723
01:50:47,014 --> 01:50:48,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm mostly a kitty person.

1724
01:50:50,123 --> 01:50:55,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Swim is tweeting us Namco Bandai will be releasing the first Sailor Moon game on the Nintendo DS by year's end

1725
01:50:56,528 --> 01:50:56,928
[SPEAKER_07]: in Italy.

1726
01:50:57,809 --> 01:50:58,770
[SPEAKER_07]: No other details yet.

1727
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:03,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be the first new Sailor Moon game since the series was relaunched internationally early this year.

1728
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:04,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So get your Sailor Moon on.

1729
01:51:06,856 --> 01:51:07,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1730
01:51:07,697 --> 01:51:12,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator is saying, I'm doing all I can to promote OLR on Facebook, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.

1731
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it'll get you more listeners.

1732
01:51:14,582 --> 01:51:16,043
[SPEAKER_07]: You, sir, get a gold star.

1733
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:16,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1734
01:51:16,924 --> 01:51:19,405
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all we ask is to help get the word out about OLR.

1735
01:51:19,646 --> 01:51:20,947
[SPEAKER_07]: But, of course, I need to say this.

1736
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:23,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm saying Spazinator is doing this, but just remember, guys, don't spam.

1737
01:51:24,249 --> 01:51:26,634
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to spam people because that just makes us look bad.

1738
01:51:27,115 --> 01:51:27,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1739
01:51:28,438 --> 01:51:30,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Tasselhoff sends us a tweet.

1740
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:31,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR!

1741
01:51:32,028 --> 01:51:34,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it when people spell hey, H-A-Y.

1742
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:35,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

1743
01:51:35,711 --> 01:51:41,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, O-L-R, what was a scene in a video game that made you shed a tear or cry because of the scene?

1744
01:51:42,115 --> 01:51:45,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we were talking about this on Warcraft the other night on Vent.

1745
01:51:46,218 --> 01:51:48,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Games that made you cry, that they were so sad.

1746
01:51:49,681 --> 01:51:53,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably cried like twice during Lost Odyssey, and I didn't even beat the game.

1747
01:51:53,804 --> 01:51:57,267
[SPEAKER_07]: But just the end of the first disc especially was very, very sad.

1748
01:51:57,907 --> 01:51:59,028
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1749
01:52:23,038 --> 01:52:23,759
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple.

1750
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:25,601
[SPEAKER_03]: At least a few puzzle games.

1751
01:52:25,761 --> 01:52:30,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And playing X-Men vs. Street Fighter with Dan because I'd get so pissed off at him that I'd cry.

1752
01:52:33,329 --> 01:52:33,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I can admit it.

1753
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:34,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1754
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:48,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on to some other tweets Oh, we've been getting this from a couple people actually Aki Ripper sends us a tweet Bejeweled is free at the moment at PopCap.com That's right, that's only for about another, what, two hours?

1755
01:52:48,924 --> 01:52:55,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So sadly, too late for the podcasties But if you're listening to this now, you can get Bejeweled 2 free I gotta be honest though

1756
01:52:56,813 --> 01:53:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how many of you don't already own Bejeweled 2 in one way or another?

1757
01:53:00,836 --> 01:53:01,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.

1758
01:53:01,516 --> 01:53:01,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1759
01:53:01,756 --> 01:53:03,017
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play it online for free.

1760
01:53:03,057 --> 01:53:03,718
[SPEAKER_07]: You always could.

1761
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:05,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't interested, but I like free shit.

1762
01:53:05,699 --> 01:53:06,519
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I got the iPhone 1?

1763
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,122
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I had it on my old-ass phone back in the day.

1764
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:13,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it on the iPhone and the Xbox 360.

1765
01:53:14,124 --> 01:53:18,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate that they're giving away a free game, but it's a 10-year-old game, you guys.

1766
01:53:19,388 --> 01:53:20,769
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but hey, free games are free games.

1767
01:53:21,983 --> 01:53:24,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I just feel like I'm being a digital hoarder if I download that.

1768
01:53:24,345 --> 01:53:25,066
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1769
01:53:25,826 --> 01:53:31,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator PSN says, FYI, in Holmes Theater, there's an episode of Inuyasha streaming for free.

1770
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:40,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's kind of neat that they're using the theater to stream free, like, quote unquote, real things and not just the in-house Sony stuff like the tester or whatever.

1771
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:41,680
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

1772
01:53:42,461 --> 01:53:43,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they should do more of that in Sony Home.

1773
01:53:45,803 --> 01:53:50,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says Kirby's Epic Yarn was supposed to be a new IP for Nintendo.

1774
01:53:50,947 --> 01:53:53,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So originally, I guess this wasn't even going to be a Kirby game.

1775
01:53:53,429 --> 01:53:54,010
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of neat.

1776
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,851
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually linking us to a story here.

1777
01:53:56,312 --> 01:53:57,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Iwata made some comments on this.

1778
01:53:59,574 --> 01:54:00,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, let's see.

1779
01:54:01,676 --> 01:54:11,384
[SPEAKER_07]: It was revealed that Kirby was not going to be in the game and the original character going by the name of Fluff could have been the main character with the game carrying the title World of Yarn instead.

1780
01:54:12,173 --> 01:54:20,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is funny given the other article that said that it was inspired by a Kirby commercial that they did in Japan in the mid-90s.

1781
01:54:21,044 --> 01:54:21,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1782
01:54:23,167 --> 01:54:23,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1783
01:54:23,568 --> 01:54:28,814
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets and I don't remember either of these being on our show roll so I'll go ahead and mention both these stories real quick.

1784
01:54:28,874 --> 01:54:29,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, from TigerClaw on Twitter.

1785
01:54:30,777 --> 01:54:47,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo patent shows the Wii Vitality Sensor game example so I guess the patent leaked out and it kind of shows how this thing works let's see the Vitality Sensor measures a player's relax fluid sounds kind of gross it's just one of the examples of the game

1786
01:54:48,354 --> 01:54:49,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

1787
01:55:08,926 --> 01:55:11,548
[SPEAKER_07]: The character automatically moves as the screen scrolls to the right.

1788
01:55:11,948 --> 01:55:15,470
[SPEAKER_07]: When you inhale, you fire a smiling blob's hat up towards the ceiling.

1789
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:16,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It drops when you exhale.

1790
01:55:17,191 --> 01:55:20,253
[SPEAKER_07]: This game uses the vitality sensor to identify inhales and exhales.

1791
01:55:21,614 --> 01:55:27,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, but again, I don't see how this is going to... They'll make a WarioWare game out of this and that's it.

1792
01:55:27,718 --> 01:55:28,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1793
01:55:29,659 --> 01:55:31,540
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always a WarioWare game for the peripheral.

1794
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:32,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it'll be done.

1795
01:55:33,749 --> 01:55:41,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, and I remember reading about this too, and this is always sad to hear about layoffs, but Microsoft's in-game ad unit apparently is shutting down this month.

1796
01:55:41,612 --> 01:55:55,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a report in an ad industry trade publication, Adweek, citing sources close to the company and insiders at Microsoft stating that massive general manager JJ Richards is now seeking new employment and other unit members have been reassigned throughout the company.

1797
01:55:55,218 --> 01:55:56,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess only one person got laid off.

1798
01:55:57,139 --> 01:55:59,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that's good that they were able to be redistributed.

1799
01:56:00,101 --> 01:56:03,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft apparently had been shopping around a massive buyout in the past few months.

1800
01:56:04,824 --> 01:56:15,912
[SPEAKER_07]: What this all boils down to though, I guess it's conflicts with the Xbox Live team because the Xbox Live team sells the ads directly on the Xbox dashboard and doesn't really want the competition with the in-game ads.

1801
01:56:16,792 --> 01:56:17,373
[SPEAKER_07]: So there it goes.

1802
01:56:17,453 --> 01:56:17,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1803
01:56:20,285 --> 01:56:20,685
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1804
01:56:20,765 --> 01:56:23,948
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our twits, tweets, twats for tonight.

1805
01:56:23,988 --> 01:56:26,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1806
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:27,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys for your tweets.

1807
01:56:27,631 --> 01:56:28,952
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week on the Twitter.

1808
01:56:29,412 --> 01:56:33,516
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, I'm going to have to go back and wake up Loki from his iPhone game.

1809
01:56:33,556 --> 01:56:34,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm awake.

1810
01:56:34,477 --> 01:56:34,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1811
01:56:34,777 --> 01:56:36,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing Climber.

1812
01:56:36,758 --> 01:56:37,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

1813
01:56:37,399 --> 01:56:38,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like Crazy Climber?

1814
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:46,162
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's like if you cross Bionic Commando with a ninja, and it's all climbing really fast.

1815
01:56:46,342 --> 01:56:46,822
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

1816
01:56:47,762 --> 01:56:48,563
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's free.

1817
01:56:49,223 --> 01:56:49,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Free is awesome.

1818
01:56:50,583 --> 01:56:51,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Free is awesome.

1819
01:56:51,743 --> 01:56:52,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is kind of neat.

1820
01:56:53,184 --> 01:57:03,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, AT&T U-verse is going to be offering IPTV, I guess, or streaming TV, coming to your Xbox 360.

1821
01:57:04,187 --> 01:57:05,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is coming in November.

1822
01:57:06,268 --> 01:57:08,454
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1823
01:57:14,955 --> 01:57:18,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So you will be able to, I guess, stream TV to it.

1824
01:57:19,158 --> 01:57:25,862
[SPEAKER_08]: It says it must have at least one standard receiver or DVR in order for the Xbox as a set-top box to work.

1825
01:57:26,542 --> 01:57:32,125
[SPEAKER_08]: And it says new fields will be displayed on the TV receiver section, blah, blah, blah.

1826
01:57:32,286 --> 01:57:38,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox connection kit will include an installation CD remote and dongle.

1827
01:57:38,529 --> 01:57:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Dongle!

1828
01:57:39,230 --> 01:57:39,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah!

1829
01:57:41,658 --> 01:57:45,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and so I guess it's going to be coming very soon.

1830
01:57:45,363 --> 01:57:49,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess with the new dashboard, they'll be coming out probably very soon as well.

1831
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:52,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of neat.

1832
01:57:52,472 --> 01:57:55,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Wish I had ATT U-verse because Comcast sucks.

1833
01:57:56,337 --> 01:57:58,780
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't have that option right now.

1834
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess that's cool.

1835
01:58:04,992 --> 01:58:05,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, though.

1836
01:58:05,493 --> 01:58:10,536
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like with all these Apple TVs and Netflix and all this other stuff, this seems to be a couple years late now.

1837
01:58:10,636 --> 01:58:11,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1838
01:58:11,537 --> 01:58:13,659
[SPEAKER_07]: When we first heard about it in Europe, it sounded awesome.

1839
01:58:13,899 --> 01:58:15,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it Japan that had this first?

1840
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:15,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

1841
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:16,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounded awesome.

1842
01:58:16,881 --> 01:58:24,747
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that we have all this other stuff that delivers TV shows, I mean, there's only so many ways you can watch Glee over the internets.

1843
01:58:24,767 --> 01:58:25,287
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1844
01:58:25,327 --> 01:58:27,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we really need this one as well?

1845
01:58:27,449 --> 01:58:27,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1846
01:58:27,769 --> 01:58:29,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot you're on the I Hate Glee bandwagon now.

1847
01:58:30,731 --> 01:58:31,892
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the whole Beatles.

1848
01:58:32,252 --> 01:58:34,974
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was on the I Hate Glee bandwagon before then.

1849
01:58:34,994 --> 01:58:35,995
[SPEAKER_03]: The show just irritates me.

1850
01:58:38,276 --> 01:58:42,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't watched it this season, so I can't say, but I always, in my gut, thought that show was going to be like Heroes.

1851
01:58:43,339 --> 01:58:45,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome first season, not so great in future seasons.

1852
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:46,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

1853
01:58:46,021 --> 01:58:46,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Glee.

1854
01:58:46,621 --> 01:58:47,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really been watching it lately, though.

1855
01:58:47,802 --> 01:58:48,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Glee is like Heroes?

1856
01:58:49,723 --> 01:58:53,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it's plot, but just, you know how Heroes... This week on Heroes, it's...

1857
01:58:54,286 --> 01:58:55,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaga Week!

1858
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:59,308
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how Heroes had an awesome first season and then its second season was like, okay?

1859
01:58:59,768 --> 01:59:00,448
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, yeah.

1860
01:59:00,908 --> 01:59:03,869
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the chick that was like, Maya, that was her name?

1861
01:59:03,929 --> 01:59:05,790
[SPEAKER_07]: She just like single-handedly ruined the show, remember that?

1862
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,151
[SPEAKER_08]: My emo powers!

1863
01:59:10,171 --> 01:59:11,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1864
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:14,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I sucked life out of you with my emo!

1865
01:59:14,192 --> 01:59:14,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1866
01:59:15,292 --> 01:59:16,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was a terrible season.

1867
01:59:17,313 --> 01:59:18,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just went downhill.

1868
01:59:19,374 --> 01:59:21,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like an emo to ruin it for everybody.

1869
01:59:21,454 --> 01:59:21,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1870
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:28,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's see.

1871
01:59:28,522 --> 01:59:32,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wanted to give a quick update real quick because I'm catching up on my private messages.

1872
01:59:32,384 --> 01:59:37,687
[SPEAKER_07]: That whole Extra Life thing I was reading about earlier, Jessica went and got a tiny URL for it.

1873
01:59:37,727 --> 01:59:41,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is really easy if you want to participate and help Bress Lowell from Understation Live out.

1874
01:59:42,410 --> 01:59:48,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to tinyurl.com slash Bress Lowell, B-R-E-S-S-L-O-L.

1875
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:50,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can help out.

1876
01:59:50,495 --> 01:59:52,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll put that on the Twitter too, just in case you kids forget.

1877
01:59:52,977 --> 01:59:53,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1878
01:59:53,922 --> 01:59:55,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on though to some other news.

1879
01:59:55,583 --> 01:59:58,044
[SPEAKER_07]: This is about one of my favorite games, Rock Band!

1880
01:59:58,084 --> 01:59:58,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1881
01:59:59,185 --> 02:00:03,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band just hit 2,000 download songs this week.

1882
02:00:03,507 --> 02:00:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's 2,000 between download and on disc.

1883
02:00:06,668 --> 02:00:10,030
[SPEAKER_07]: But however you count it, it hit its 2,000th song this week.

1884
02:00:10,050 --> 02:00:12,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Potentially 2,000 songs in your Rock Band library.

1885
02:00:13,432 --> 02:00:14,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1886
02:00:14,072 --> 02:00:16,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and then, does that even count the...

1887
02:00:18,834 --> 02:00:20,575
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rock Band Network or whatever?

1888
02:00:20,595 --> 02:00:21,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

1889
02:00:21,115 --> 02:00:21,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, does it?

1890
02:00:21,935 --> 02:00:22,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, still though.

1891
02:00:22,636 --> 02:00:23,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still an impressive number.

1892
02:00:24,256 --> 02:00:27,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced was the 2000th song, if you care.

1893
02:00:27,998 --> 02:00:29,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I was curious how many songs they had.

1894
02:00:30,059 --> 02:00:30,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

1895
02:00:31,639 --> 02:00:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, if you're curious how much those have been downloaded, 75 million tracks from the Rock Band Store and the Rock Band Network.

1896
02:00:40,009 --> 02:00:40,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of downloads

1897
02:01:10,102 --> 02:01:15,999
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go Bon Jovi coming soon to Rock Band DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1898
02:01:16,716 --> 02:01:17,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've got more stuff.

1899
02:01:18,297 --> 02:01:37,968
[SPEAKER_03]: How about, for those of us who are big fans of Konami's other goings-on before there was DDR, the X-Men arcade game, remember the one that was two-screen, six-player, or one-screen, four-player, is going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

1900
02:01:38,128 --> 02:01:38,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

1901
02:01:39,149 --> 02:01:39,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1902
02:01:39,909 --> 02:01:40,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Dibs on Storm.

1903
02:01:41,811 --> 02:01:43,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it was all about playing Dazzler for me.

1904
02:01:44,612 --> 02:01:47,015
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's going to be out guess when?

1905
02:01:48,016 --> 02:01:48,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon!

1906
02:01:49,137 --> 02:01:49,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, soon.

1907
02:01:49,958 --> 02:01:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Our favorite release date.

1908
02:01:52,821 --> 02:01:56,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all about playing Dazzler which is the only game she was ever good in.

1909
02:01:56,845 --> 02:01:58,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the only game she was in.

1910
02:01:58,726 --> 02:02:00,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So what about the whole six player thing?

1911
02:02:00,327 --> 02:02:02,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to get to play six players online all at once?

1912
02:02:03,168 --> 02:02:04,028
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be epic.

1913
02:02:04,048 --> 02:02:05,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say.

1914
02:02:05,309 --> 02:02:07,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hearing a rumor about that.

1915
02:02:07,149 --> 02:02:07,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

1916
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:11,731
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it will retain six player co-op.

1917
02:02:12,151 --> 02:02:12,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1918
02:02:12,892 --> 02:02:13,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Online.

1919
02:02:14,032 --> 02:02:14,272
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1920
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:20,075
[SPEAKER_07]: New York Comic Con was this weekend, so I'm sure there's a lot of news coming out of that that's comic book related, so that's kind of cool.

1921
02:02:21,075 --> 02:02:22,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love this picture from the intro.

1922
02:02:22,776 --> 02:02:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Storm just does not give a fuck.

1923
02:02:24,857 --> 02:02:25,637
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not amused.

1924
02:02:27,618 --> 02:02:28,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Storm ain't having it.

1925
02:02:28,726 --> 02:02:28,926
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1926
02:02:29,626 --> 02:02:30,807
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like... Because she's awesome.

1927
02:02:30,947 --> 02:02:33,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch, please.

1928
02:02:33,648 --> 02:02:37,469
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I bet that game will come out in time for the release of the new X-Men game.

1929
02:02:37,749 --> 02:02:38,890
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the new X-Men movie?

1930
02:02:38,970 --> 02:02:40,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't there a new X-Men movie coming out next year?

1931
02:02:40,851 --> 02:02:40,971
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1932
02:02:41,071 --> 02:02:44,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like it's First Class or something.

1933
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a prequel or whatever.

1934
02:02:45,852 --> 02:02:46,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see it.

1935
02:02:47,673 --> 02:02:48,814
[SPEAKER_07]: They recast everybody.

1936
02:02:49,174 --> 02:02:52,275
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a whole comic series called X-Men First Class.

1937
02:02:52,975 --> 02:02:53,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1938
02:02:54,536 --> 02:02:57,397
[SPEAKER_03]: All the new original stories from the early days.

1939
02:02:57,857 --> 02:02:58,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1940
02:02:59,505 --> 02:03:00,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be interesting, I suppose.

1941
02:03:01,429 --> 02:03:04,476
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to be hard without Patrick Stewart as Professor X, I'm just saying.

1942
02:03:05,758 --> 02:03:07,382
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're not going to do a listless night.

1943
02:03:07,402 --> 02:03:09,426
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to table that until next week, so let's move on with some more news.

1944
02:03:09,466 --> 02:03:09,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1945
02:03:11,307 --> 02:03:13,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so this is kind of cool.

1946
02:03:14,189 --> 02:03:23,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, Mega Man Legends is going to be asking people to submit ideas for stuff that they want to see in the game.

1947
02:03:24,814 --> 02:03:31,338
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be asking the community to actively participate in different development parts.

1948
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:33,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the examples that they had on the one page there.

1949
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:36,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Boss characters, voice actors, ideas.

1950
02:03:37,082 --> 02:03:38,463
[SPEAKER_08]: They want them all.

1951
02:03:39,503 --> 02:03:41,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, that's why Project is in the title.

1952
02:03:41,685 --> 02:03:46,788
[SPEAKER_08]: They said it would be a collaborative experience, but not in the way Mega Man Universe is.

1953
02:03:47,069 --> 02:03:51,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, I guess the community will be able to actively participate in the development of the game.

1954
02:03:52,292 --> 02:04:00,658
[SPEAKER_08]: The Capcom Unity website will be updated with a dev room where fans will be able to submit their gameplay ideas, boss ideas, character ideas, and more.

1955
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:05,421
[SPEAKER_08]: In the future, fans will be able to vie for position in the game's voice cast.

1956
02:04:06,302 --> 02:04:08,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Pizza Man!

1957
02:04:10,065 --> 02:04:12,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these character designs are really cute, the fan-submitted ones.

1958
02:04:13,087 --> 02:04:14,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they don't look bad.

1959
02:04:15,449 --> 02:04:17,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be a voice actor in Mega Man Legends.

1960
02:04:18,692 --> 02:04:19,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what do I sign up?

1961
02:04:20,253 --> 02:04:21,794
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got the sign up on the website.

1962
02:04:21,854 --> 02:04:22,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Bunny Girl!

1963
02:04:25,297 --> 02:04:27,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be a voice actor for Bunny Girl, sorry.

1964
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:30,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's kind of cool.

1965
02:04:32,136 --> 02:04:35,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder why all this audience participation in the game?

1966
02:04:35,738 --> 02:04:38,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just a gimmick to try and sell more copies?

1967
02:04:38,299 --> 02:04:40,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you think they just really want fresh ideas?

1968
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what do you think is the motivation behind this?

1969
02:04:44,142 --> 02:04:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

1970
02:04:45,503 --> 02:04:46,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably just more of the...

1971
02:04:49,418 --> 02:04:55,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Meta stuff because everybody likes being able to contribute to a game and having their credit and stuff.

1972
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:58,360
[SPEAKER_08]: It's way better than having a name on the form for purchasing.

1973
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that whole web 2.0 kind of stuff.

1974
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:01,961
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

1975
02:05:03,261 --> 02:05:03,622
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1976
02:05:04,642 --> 02:05:06,482
[SPEAKER_08]: That way fans can't bitch if the game sucks.

1977
02:05:07,062 --> 02:05:08,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you made it.

1978
02:05:09,183 --> 02:05:11,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all your fault the game got bad reviews.

1979
02:05:11,964 --> 02:05:12,224
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1980
02:05:13,844 --> 02:05:15,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is kind of strange.

1981
02:05:15,564 --> 02:05:17,205
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how there's the Kindle, right?

1982
02:05:17,505 --> 02:05:19,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, DarkSakura, you use the Kindle, right?

1983
02:05:19,365 --> 02:05:20,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I use the Kindle app on my phone.

1984
02:05:21,026 --> 02:05:22,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that just the same thing as the Kindle?

1985
02:05:22,926 --> 02:05:23,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1986
02:05:23,246 --> 02:05:26,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Kindle itself is the device that Amazon sells.

1987
02:05:27,727 --> 02:05:28,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the large one.

1988
02:05:28,728 --> 02:05:30,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got internet access and shit.

1989
02:05:30,168 --> 02:05:30,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1990
02:05:30,788 --> 02:05:32,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have the app for it on my phone so I can read books.

1991
02:05:33,389 --> 02:05:33,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1992
02:05:34,029 --> 02:05:34,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you use iBooks for that?

1993
02:05:36,318 --> 02:05:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for books I bought through the Kindle store.

1994
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:38,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, got it.

1995
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:38,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1996
02:05:39,341 --> 02:05:39,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyhow.

1997
02:05:39,982 --> 02:05:41,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought some of my school books that way.

1998
02:05:41,803 --> 02:05:43,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can carry them around on my iPhone.

1999
02:05:43,425 --> 02:05:43,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

2000
02:05:43,985 --> 02:05:44,246
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2001
02:05:44,306 --> 02:05:44,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyhow.

2002
02:05:45,687 --> 02:05:49,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Kindle is, of course, you know, it's a device that, you know, most usually you read books on it.

2003
02:05:50,031 --> 02:05:54,475
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, apparently, there's some games showing up on Kindle.

2004
02:05:54,835 --> 02:05:57,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Scrabble is on Kindle right now.

2005
02:05:57,818 --> 02:05:58,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know that.

2006
02:05:58,619 --> 02:06:01,722
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, Scrabble actually made its way to the top of the Kindle charts.

2007
02:06:02,242 --> 02:06:09,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently some folks have ported Zork 1, Zork 2, Zork 3, and Mini Zork to the Kindle.

2008
02:06:09,107 --> 02:06:10,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know there was a Mini Zork.

2009
02:06:11,208 --> 02:06:14,710
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Zork 1, Zork 2, and Zork 3 are now all out on the Kindle.

2010
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:15,451
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of awesome.

2011
02:06:17,032 --> 02:06:21,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't think the Kindle has too much in the way of a keyboard, so I'm not sure how awesome this is.

2012
02:06:21,715 --> 02:06:24,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think it has some keyboard, but it's kind of small.

2013
02:06:24,837 --> 02:06:26,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how much fun this is to play.

2014
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:31,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's out there, and so you are standing in front of a white mailbox.

2015
02:06:31,121 --> 02:06:31,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get eaten by a Gru.

2016
02:06:33,463 --> 02:06:35,445
[SPEAKER_07]: You can experience it all over again.

2017
02:06:37,226 --> 02:06:37,707
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2018
02:06:38,867 --> 02:06:45,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we're going to open up ye olde mailbag.

2019
02:06:46,514 --> 02:06:46,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Dive in.

2020
02:06:46,954 --> 02:06:48,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the one email.

2021
02:06:48,575 --> 02:06:49,276
[SPEAKER_03]: One email.

2022
02:06:50,097 --> 02:06:50,177
[SPEAKER_07]: One.

2023
02:06:50,397 --> 02:06:51,077
[SPEAKER_07]: One email.

2024
02:06:51,478 --> 02:06:52,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's fantastic.

2025
02:06:52,699 --> 02:06:57,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to be fair, I failed on getting the show up on time, so we'll probably have double the emails next week.

2026
02:06:59,518 --> 02:07:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was sick.

2027
02:07:00,499 --> 02:07:01,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave me alone.

2028
02:07:01,259 --> 02:07:02,959
[SPEAKER_03]: He brought me pita chips.

2029
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:04,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure did.

2030
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:05,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And a soda.

2031
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:06,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR crew.

2032
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:07,900
[SPEAKER_03]: AZHP here.

2033
02:07:08,761 --> 02:07:16,183
[SPEAKER_03]: If you may recall, Rob had mentioned a few episodes ago that Pooping would be a funny name for a social networking site for people on the toilet.

2034
02:07:16,363 --> 02:07:18,903
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because of Ping.com, remember?

2035
02:07:19,304 --> 02:07:20,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Apple's Ping.

2036
02:07:21,567 --> 02:07:29,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I decided to run with that idea, and I'm moderately proud to bring you www.poo-ping.com.

2037
02:07:30,110 --> 02:07:30,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2038
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:33,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I whipped it together over about two weeks.

2039
02:07:33,972 --> 02:07:37,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I work a full-time job, I was only able to put an hour or two a day into it.

2040
02:07:38,373 --> 02:07:44,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Its goal is to be like Yelp for public restrooms, though a number of factors prevent me from devoting much time to it.

2041
02:07:44,796 --> 02:07:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: The aforementioned full-time job and my lack of any sort of prowess related to design.

2042
02:07:50,878 --> 02:07:51,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2043
02:08:20,281 --> 02:08:21,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not too well polished.

2044
02:08:22,126 --> 02:08:27,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if I find myself unemployed in the future or if you hire Jamie, I can get back to it or she can make it look pretty.

2045
02:08:28,726 --> 02:08:43,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate if the crew or the chat could throw out some ideas that you would like to see on the site, such as an iPhone app, Google Map integration, Foursquare-style check-ins, a friends list, Twitter-style updates, experience points-based ranking system for adding restrooms, etc.

2046
02:08:43,178 --> 02:08:44,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I can draw you pictures of poop.

2047
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:46,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that really necessary?

2048
02:08:46,381 --> 02:08:46,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2049
02:08:47,062 --> 02:08:47,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

2050
02:08:47,622 --> 02:08:48,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I might one day implement them.

2051
02:08:49,564 --> 02:08:52,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, hope you enjoyed it as bare-bones as it is.

2052
02:08:52,126 --> 02:08:54,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Your friendly neighborhood programmer, AZHP.

2053
02:08:55,034 --> 02:08:55,894
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty amazing.

2054
02:08:55,935 --> 02:08:58,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at the site, poo-ping.com.

2055
02:08:58,576 --> 02:08:59,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Put my bathroom on it.

2056
02:08:59,957 --> 02:09:00,337
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2057
02:09:00,397 --> 02:09:01,557
[SPEAKER_07]: The site for picky poopers.

2058
02:09:01,718 --> 02:09:02,218
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2059
02:09:02,878 --> 02:09:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually there.

2060
02:09:04,499 --> 02:09:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's already one review on there for Next Tag.

2061
02:09:10,902 --> 02:09:18,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just talks about where there's four stalls, apparently, and there's paper towels as the hand-drying mechanism and the faucet type.

2062
02:09:19,607 --> 02:09:23,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually write a review there and talk all about it.

2063
02:09:23,809 --> 02:09:52,627
[SPEAKER_07]: and the comment on this restroom the faucet on the left doesn't shut off all the way unless you push down on it harder restroom is fairly clean and paper towels and toilet paper get restocked often I'm going to review the toilet at Outback I was going to say I should review the bathroom at Jack in the Box that I was at before the show tonight because when I turned on the sink it was so it was like on full blast I got shot with water and it just looked like I crapped my pants like the front of my pants and I was so mad so I was going to write a nasty review of the sink there

2064
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:54,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when our show inspires these ideas.

2065
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,441
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ultimate tribute.

2066
02:09:56,501 --> 02:09:57,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much.

2067
02:10:12,512 --> 02:10:15,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So Salacious Pop is saying he just thought of a mailbag for you.

2068
02:10:15,516 --> 02:10:20,422
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't send this in the email, but I think this is a great question, and I can't wait to hear the rants this inspires.

2069
02:10:21,043 --> 02:10:27,952
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, have you seen the new Gap logo, and do you feel the logo would be helped by Comic Sans or Papyrus?

2070
02:10:28,392 --> 02:10:29,334
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

2071
02:10:29,354 --> 02:10:29,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me look at it.

2072
02:10:31,138 --> 02:10:32,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Their logo is pretty weak.

2073
02:10:33,219 --> 02:10:34,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you not seen the new Gap logo?

2074
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:35,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like crap.

2075
02:10:35,341 --> 02:10:36,521
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a logo right now.

2076
02:10:36,541 --> 02:10:38,303
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all this new controversy.

2077
02:10:38,343 --> 02:10:39,643
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just go to Gap.com.

2078
02:10:39,924 --> 02:10:40,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going.

2079
02:10:40,384 --> 02:10:40,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see it.

2080
02:10:41,244 --> 02:10:42,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's... There's their new logo.

2081
02:10:42,545 --> 02:10:43,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Helvetica.

2082
02:10:43,506 --> 02:10:43,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2083
02:10:43,986 --> 02:10:44,326
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2084
02:10:44,786 --> 02:10:45,767
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not Helvetica.

2085
02:10:46,247 --> 02:10:46,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

2086
02:10:46,848 --> 02:10:47,688
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Gap with a box.

2087
02:10:49,449 --> 02:10:49,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

2088
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:50,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

2089
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:53,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, like, all these designers everywhere are pissed.

2090
02:10:53,332 --> 02:10:54,973
[SPEAKER_07]: They have, like, way better designs.

2091
02:10:54,993 --> 02:10:56,154
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

2092
02:10:56,494 --> 02:10:56,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

2093
02:10:58,456 --> 02:11:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the old one better, but this isn't bad.

2094
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,461
[SPEAKER_03]: The old one just was better.

2095
02:11:07,501 --> 02:11:08,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more iconic.

2096
02:11:08,541 --> 02:11:09,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the square is retarded.

2097
02:11:11,903 --> 02:11:12,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

2098
02:11:12,924 --> 02:11:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really... No, the old one was better.

2099
02:11:16,992 --> 02:11:17,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Poo-Ping.com

2100
02:11:33,686 --> 02:11:36,148
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I will say about this, if I may.

2101
02:11:36,889 --> 02:11:37,089
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2102
02:11:37,549 --> 02:11:48,158
[SPEAKER_03]: If this was the first time they'd ever done a logo, as in if they hadn't had that nice one they had before, this would be fine.

2103
02:11:48,598 --> 02:11:51,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did they feel they needed to change their logo in the first place?

2104
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too Swiss.

2105
02:11:54,259 --> 02:11:55,100
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2106
02:12:15,458 --> 02:12:18,499
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like... What's that tax place?

2107
02:12:18,519 --> 02:12:18,979
[SPEAKER_03]: H&R Block?

2108
02:12:18,999 --> 02:12:21,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like H&R Block.

2109
02:12:22,041 --> 02:12:22,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew that.

2110
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:23,961
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed their font from Futura.

2111
02:12:24,321 --> 02:12:24,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did?

2112
02:12:24,922 --> 02:12:25,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Ikea.

2113
02:12:25,622 --> 02:12:25,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

2114
02:12:26,342 --> 02:12:27,483
[SPEAKER_03]: They based it off of a different one.

2115
02:12:27,943 --> 02:12:30,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Theirs was like a super wide version of Futura.

2116
02:12:31,644 --> 02:12:32,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that font.

2117
02:12:32,565 --> 02:12:33,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty, but they changed it.

2118
02:12:35,446 --> 02:12:35,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2119
02:12:35,866 --> 02:12:38,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... Keep in mind, I love Helvetica.

2120
02:12:39,007 --> 02:12:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

2121
02:12:40,808 --> 02:12:41,248
[SPEAKER_03]: This just...

2122
02:12:41,749 --> 02:12:42,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the movie?

2123
02:12:42,970 --> 02:12:43,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have.

2124
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:44,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a copy.

2125
02:12:44,911 --> 02:12:45,191
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2126
02:12:45,651 --> 02:12:46,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the book.

2127
02:12:47,752 --> 02:12:48,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not joking.

2128
02:12:48,473 --> 02:12:49,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it all printed in Helvetica?

2129
02:12:50,173 --> 02:12:52,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's called Helvetica, Homage to a Tight Face.

2130
02:12:52,795 --> 02:12:53,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go get it.

2131
02:12:53,475 --> 02:12:53,995
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's all right.

2132
02:12:54,476 --> 02:12:54,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

2133
02:12:55,156 --> 02:12:55,716
[SPEAKER_07]: No one care.

2134
02:12:55,976 --> 02:12:56,237
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2135
02:12:56,837 --> 02:12:58,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to put it on the pictures.

2136
02:12:58,338 --> 02:12:58,778
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fine.

2137
02:12:58,798 --> 02:12:59,638
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take a picture and all that.

2138
02:13:00,739 --> 02:13:02,120
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to get into the FUs of the week, though.

2139
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:06,242
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the part of the show where we get really angsty and get mad and throw things.

2140
02:13:21,627 --> 02:13:35,682
[SPEAKER_03]: A few to my cat's butt for being too fat to lift onto her toilet box, her litter box, and pee pee in it properly.

2141
02:13:37,785 --> 02:13:38,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's mostly my fault.

2142
02:13:39,046 --> 02:13:40,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have exercised my cat more.

2143
02:13:42,225 --> 02:14:07,965
[SPEAKER_03]: But she only is able to pee in about half of the box And the rest of the pee will get on the floor For the record, Shermie's bathroom is in the bathroom closet And we have the bottom part of the door sawed off So she can just climb under there and do her business in private But she misses the box, so the pee goes under her box And that means I have to lift her box and clean it Which is really disgusting But she has not pooped during the show

2144
02:14:11,587 --> 02:14:12,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great!

2145
02:14:13,808 --> 02:14:14,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody linked us in the chatroom.

2146
02:14:14,988 --> 02:14:19,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess there's this website where you can generate your own Gap logo and someone made OLR.

2147
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:20,150
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2148
02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:21,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that in two seconds in Photoshop.

2149
02:14:22,931 --> 02:14:23,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2150
02:14:24,152 --> 02:14:24,912
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Laser123454321.

2151
02:14:24,932 --> 02:14:25,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Send that.

2152
02:14:28,021 --> 02:14:29,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Loki, you have a nephew of the week.

2153
02:14:30,564 --> 02:14:35,191
[SPEAKER_08]: A nephew of the week who the cats live in my backyard because they are pooping everywhere.

2154
02:14:36,192 --> 02:14:37,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And it smells like poop everywhere.

2155
02:14:38,715 --> 02:14:40,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And they need to leave the premise.

2156
02:14:43,001 --> 02:14:43,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it?

2157
02:14:44,083 --> 02:14:45,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Need to leave the premise of the premises.

2158
02:14:47,133 --> 02:15:15,668
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever if that's it then my FU of the week I have a few, FU to me being sick because it sucked and I've been sleeping like 12 and 13 hours this weekend which is sad because I'm not going to get to see Alan next weekend so it kind of sucks that I spent this whole weekend sleeping so yeah, boo to that boo to the fact that Midway Mania was closed to California Adventure when I went this last time so I'm very upset about that because I wanted to take Alan on that and I couldn't

2159
02:15:16,428 --> 02:15:18,209
[SPEAKER_07]: But yay to us going on Tower of Terror.

2160
02:15:18,569 --> 02:15:19,469
[SPEAKER_07]: That made me very happy.

2161
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:21,330
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that ride's great.

2162
02:15:22,090 --> 02:15:22,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you think so.

2163
02:15:23,091 --> 02:15:23,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

2164
02:15:23,691 --> 02:15:29,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my last FU goes to the baggage handler at JetBlue, who I guess threw my bag.

2165
02:15:30,013 --> 02:15:31,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Or either that or the people who designed my bag.

2166
02:15:32,334 --> 02:15:38,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my laptop kind of fell out of the laptop part of my bag and into the main part of my bag.

2167
02:15:38,217 --> 02:15:42,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And as it was being slung around, I now have a line of dead pixels on my monitor.

2168
02:15:42,959 --> 02:15:43,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

2169
02:15:44,119 --> 02:15:44,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2170
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I remembered one more FU that I had.

2171
02:15:47,501 --> 02:15:55,507
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to Windows 7 for whatever reason, removing the What You Hear feature on the recording options on your sound card.

2172
02:15:55,987 --> 02:16:00,711
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that has been the main holdup for why Xfer and I can't do a podcast right now.

2173
02:16:00,731 --> 02:16:01,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't figure out how to make it work.

2174
02:16:02,312 --> 02:16:03,313
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, it works here.

2175
02:16:03,373 --> 02:16:04,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're on XP here, that's why.

2176
02:16:04,734 --> 02:16:05,774
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how you do it?

2177
02:16:05,814 --> 02:16:06,055
[SPEAKER_08]: How?

2178
02:16:06,175 --> 02:16:06,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad.

2179
02:16:06,755 --> 02:16:09,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to do from speaker out to line in.

2180
02:16:10,035 --> 02:16:10,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

2181
02:16:10,936 --> 02:16:11,316
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thanks.

2182
02:16:12,237 --> 02:16:12,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks.

2183
02:16:12,917 --> 02:16:16,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Or they say get a secondary USB sound card or something.

2184
02:16:16,419 --> 02:16:17,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually been looking into that.

2185
02:16:19,802 --> 02:16:20,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2186
02:16:20,262 --> 02:16:21,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

2187
02:16:21,443 --> 02:16:24,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can help me figure out why my mic isn't working for Ventrilo.

2188
02:16:26,491 --> 02:16:27,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be similar.

2189
02:16:28,332 --> 02:16:30,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why you would even remove that feature.

2190
02:16:30,953 --> 02:16:31,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid.

2191
02:16:31,753 --> 02:16:32,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it sucks.

2192
02:16:33,174 --> 02:16:33,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends.

2193
02:16:33,874 --> 02:16:37,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I thought it was always a Sound Blaster feature, like if you had a Sound Blaster.

2194
02:16:37,896 --> 02:16:43,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have a non-Sound Blaster card in my laptop here, and I can record what I hear.

2195
02:16:43,958 --> 02:16:45,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's not, you just record it.

2196
02:16:46,019 --> 02:16:51,926
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Xfer and I ran a test run the other week where we were going to and we couldn't get his Skype thing to record.

2197
02:16:52,587 --> 02:16:56,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried everything we do here in studio to make the show work and it wouldn't work over there.

2198
02:16:56,851 --> 02:17:00,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, we use an external mixing board too, which I'm sure helps, but it's just irritating.

2199
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:04,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll try again.

2200
02:17:05,922 --> 02:17:07,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.

2201
02:17:07,603 --> 02:17:10,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna get to your phone calls soon, not just yet, but very soon.

2202
02:17:11,224 --> 02:17:16,105
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, though, we got just a couple quick stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2203
02:17:16,725 --> 02:17:17,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's interesting.

2204
02:17:18,806 --> 02:17:22,827
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Sam Raimi is working on a Earth Defense Force movie.

2205
02:17:22,847 --> 02:17:29,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, obviously, this is not anything to do with D3 game, Earth Defense Force, the greatest game on Earth.

2206
02:17:30,410 --> 02:17:34,091
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is, you know, something where, you know, apparently...

2207
02:17:35,171 --> 02:17:41,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Aliens are invading and the Earth Defense Force has to, you know, stop them from invading or whatnot.

2208
02:17:41,595 --> 02:17:43,357
[SPEAKER_08]: The details of the movie are very rough right now.

2209
02:17:43,937 --> 02:17:57,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the interesting part, though, and I'm not sure if Sam Raimi's aware of this, but apparently Earth Defense Force is actually a copyrighted name by D3, so...

2210
02:18:06,043 --> 02:18:16,211
[SPEAKER_08]: EDF follows a US military unit that has been deployed to rescue a sub that has accidentally run afoul in Chinese waters.

2211
02:18:16,871 --> 02:18:24,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently a dogfight ensues, but both the Chinese and American planes are shot out of the water by three alien spacecrafts.

2212
02:18:24,697 --> 02:18:28,300
[SPEAKER_08]: They go on to destroy landmarks and key military structures.

2213
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:34,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a race against the clock as humans try to create weaponry and vehicles that can sustain another attack.

2214
02:18:34,866 --> 02:18:39,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Just make a goddamn fucking Earth Defense Force movie based off Earth Defense Force the game.

2215
02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:42,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they were going to call it The Last Airbender, but unfortunately that was taken too.

2216
02:18:43,994 --> 02:18:45,875
[SPEAKER_03]: My rating is up on pooping.com.

2217
02:18:47,497 --> 02:18:47,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2218
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:49,599
[SPEAKER_03]: For the Outback Statehouse.

2219
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:51,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Bathroom.

2220
02:18:54,795 --> 02:18:55,836
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2221
02:19:17,114 --> 02:19:19,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have 3D breast wobbling.

2222
02:19:19,436 --> 02:19:19,876
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2223
02:19:19,937 --> 02:19:23,039
[SPEAKER_07]: A whole new breast physics mechanic thing for the 3DS.

2224
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:27,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see those titties titillating in full 3D.

2225
02:19:28,444 --> 02:19:29,585
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just great.

2226
02:19:30,806 --> 02:19:32,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you guys are very excited about that.

2227
02:19:32,827 --> 02:19:34,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

2228
02:19:34,269 --> 02:19:35,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this a day one purchase for you?

2229
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:35,910
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2230
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:36,391
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2231
02:19:36,551 --> 02:19:36,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2232
02:19:40,054 --> 02:19:43,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Trust me, I don't need to purchase a game to see boobs bouncing.

2233
02:19:44,217 --> 02:19:44,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

2234
02:19:44,978 --> 02:19:45,839
[SPEAKER_07]: You could just ask the wife.

2235
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:51,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just, I don't know, access the internet.

2236
02:19:51,884 --> 02:19:53,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Or go outside.

2237
02:19:55,503 --> 02:20:02,385
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2238
02:20:02,485 --> 02:20:07,027
[SPEAKER_07]: We are open for business on the Skype line if you want to say hello.

2239
02:20:08,307 --> 02:20:08,667
[SPEAKER_07]: You all right?

2240
02:20:08,687 --> 02:20:12,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Your chair sounded like a horn went off or something.

2241
02:20:12,168 --> 02:20:12,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that my chair?

2242
02:20:12,608 --> 02:20:13,088
[SPEAKER_03]: That was me.

2243
02:20:13,329 --> 02:20:13,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was you?

2244
02:20:14,069 --> 02:20:14,609
[SPEAKER_03]: That was me.

2245
02:20:15,509 --> 02:20:15,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

2246
02:20:15,889 --> 02:20:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to crap load or something.

2247
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:20,011
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounded like a bicycle horn.

2248
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:21,131
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

2249
02:20:22,387 --> 02:20:23,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so last minute story.

2250
02:20:23,768 --> 02:20:25,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, yeah, while we wait for calls, sure.

2251
02:20:29,871 --> 02:20:30,451
[SPEAKER_07]: My butt.

2252
02:20:30,611 --> 02:20:37,574
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura's having too much fun with that crap logo site that Laser1234531 linked us.

2253
02:20:37,674 --> 02:20:38,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2254
02:20:38,875 --> 02:20:40,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know there's other things we can talk about here.

2255
02:20:42,777 --> 02:20:45,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see if our website will actually pull up my story.

2256
02:20:45,418 --> 02:20:46,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, boo-hoo.

2257
02:20:46,399 --> 02:20:48,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo!

2258
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:49,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2259
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:49,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2260
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:50,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2261
02:21:08,888 --> 02:21:17,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, for the Democrats, at the Press A to Start screen, if you enter left 13 times, followed by the plus, you should be able to unlock them.

2262
02:21:17,613 --> 02:21:24,257
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Republicans, if you press on the same screen right 13 times, followed by the plus, you will unlock them.

2263
02:21:26,274 --> 02:21:26,714
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

2264
02:21:26,834 --> 02:21:30,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it, because the Democrats are on the left and the Republicans are on the right.

2265
02:21:31,016 --> 02:21:31,896
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you're moderate?

2266
02:21:32,616 --> 02:21:34,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you press down 13 times?

2267
02:21:34,597 --> 02:21:34,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2268
02:21:34,917 --> 02:21:36,617
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens if you push down 13 times?

2269
02:21:37,578 --> 02:21:38,418
[SPEAKER_01]: The game crashes.

2270
02:21:38,778 --> 02:21:39,498
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know.

2271
02:21:39,638 --> 02:21:41,079
[SPEAKER_01]: And you push nothing.

2272
02:21:41,839 --> 02:21:44,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing happens, because that's what happens.

2273
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:46,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Down is the tea party.

2274
02:21:49,021 --> 02:21:49,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

2275
02:21:49,821 --> 02:21:50,101
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2276
02:21:50,681 --> 02:21:55,042
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Laser12345321 is yelling at me in chat saying, just say Laser.

2277
02:21:55,542 --> 02:21:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: We had this problem before.

2278
02:21:56,402 --> 02:21:57,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like just Laser.

2279
02:21:57,703 --> 02:21:59,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't put all those numbers in your name.

2280
02:21:59,163 --> 02:22:01,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Laser12345321.

2281
02:22:01,204 --> 02:22:02,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives it class.

2282
02:22:03,064 --> 02:22:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

2283
02:22:04,804 --> 02:22:06,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Change your name to Laser321contact.

2284
02:22:06,565 --> 02:22:07,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It's even better.

2285
02:22:07,745 --> 02:22:08,445
[SPEAKER_07]: That's even better.

2286
02:22:09,445 --> 02:22:09,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

2287
02:22:09,926 --> 02:22:11,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Laser321contact.

2288
02:22:11,106 --> 02:22:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

2289
02:22:12,492 --> 02:22:17,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm thinking of the 3-2-1 contact from Electric Company, but that's a whole different scenario altogether.

2290
02:22:17,675 --> 02:22:18,916
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, now it's stuck in your head.

2291
02:22:19,537 --> 02:22:20,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, definitely.

2292
02:22:21,338 --> 02:22:33,326
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, but these two were probably one of the hardest ones for a bit, but I don't know how somebody came across it, but I was reading a few websites and somebody posted on there of how to do this, so that was quite interesting.

2293
02:22:33,866 --> 02:22:36,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for a while they were like, here's the code to unlock...

2294
02:22:37,958 --> 02:22:39,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlock the BC Boys.

2295
02:22:39,119 --> 02:22:41,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the code to unlock the ESPN.

2296
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:44,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest of the stuff, you pretty much are on your own to unlock.

2297
02:22:44,262 --> 02:22:46,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and those codes are very easy to remember, actually.

2298
02:22:47,224 --> 02:22:48,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Left 13 times.

2299
02:22:48,465 --> 02:22:49,566
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not very hard to remember.

2300
02:22:49,586 --> 02:22:50,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Or right 13 times.

2301
02:22:51,007 --> 02:22:51,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not hard to remember.

2302
02:22:51,807 --> 02:22:53,669
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like something I did by a fluke.

2303
02:22:53,709 --> 02:22:56,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, let me hit left and see what happens.

2304
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:59,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like, all of a sudden, you know, you hit the button and it happened.

2305
02:22:59,052 --> 02:22:59,933
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you hit your chime.

2306
02:22:59,973 --> 02:23:01,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, okay, what did I unlock?

2307
02:23:01,514 --> 02:23:02,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, I just unlocked, you know.

2308
02:23:03,335 --> 02:23:06,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And to unlock NBA Elite, you smash the remote against the ground 13 times.

2309
02:23:09,559 --> 02:23:10,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Our track to death can happen.

2310
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:13,763
[SPEAKER_08]: You can throw it out the window.

2311
02:23:14,043 --> 02:23:17,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was going to say, it's not like any of us have bought NBA Jam yet.

2312
02:23:17,225 --> 02:23:17,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2313
02:23:17,546 --> 02:23:21,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's a few Wii people that have bought it so far, but I sure haven't yet.

2314
02:23:21,169 --> 02:23:21,609
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

2315
02:23:21,629 --> 02:23:26,973
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I was going to buy it, and then I saw the $50 price tag, and that really turned me off.

2316
02:23:27,053 --> 02:23:32,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why the hell would I pay $50 for a just updated version of the game that came out so long ago?

2317
02:23:33,338 --> 02:23:34,479
[SPEAKER_07]: NBA Jam is fucking rad.

2318
02:23:34,559 --> 02:23:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: It was going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

2319
02:23:36,401 --> 02:23:37,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I freaking loved it.

2320
02:23:37,622 --> 02:23:38,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved playing in Arcade.

2321
02:23:38,883 --> 02:23:45,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember playing all the time, going through all the teams and trying to... As soon as I beat one team with all the teams to go, you know, and it was like a weekly thing.

2322
02:23:45,969 --> 02:23:47,070
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like NFL Blitz.

2323
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:49,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It did the same thing growing up with NFL Blitz.

2324
02:23:49,652 --> 02:23:51,614
[SPEAKER_01]: You start with one team, you go through, and then you try...

2325
02:23:52,034 --> 02:23:57,356
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're always trying to compete with everybody else in your local arcade to try to be that top number one spot.

2326
02:23:57,476 --> 02:24:06,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wish they would have done something like that, but unfortunately, they don't have the capability of online to keep global stats of that sort, which kind of ruins it.

2327
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:09,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially if you play just single player.

2328
02:24:11,562 --> 02:24:14,583
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to admit, though, you've got to play the Obama versus Palin.

2329
02:24:14,623 --> 02:24:17,064
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you want to play that and then accuse the game of being biased.

2330
02:24:17,985 --> 02:24:18,765
[SPEAKER_07]: You know you want to do that.

2331
02:24:19,634 --> 02:24:24,240
[SPEAKER_07]: If the computer cheats, yes.

2332
02:24:25,502 --> 02:24:27,565
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about Cataclysm coming out pretty soon?

2333
02:24:27,885 --> 02:24:28,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And the new patch?

2334
02:24:36,957 --> 02:24:37,317
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

2335
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:07,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if it's true that the patch is hitting this week, which most people seem to kind of agree it is, it's going to be a game changer.

2336
02:25:07,923 --> 02:25:08,463
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

2337
02:25:08,583 --> 02:25:11,004
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they always do these major patches right before.

2338
02:25:11,464 --> 02:25:12,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting.

2339
02:25:12,945 --> 02:25:13,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Two little things real quick.

2340
02:25:13,926 --> 02:25:15,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for turning me on to the game next week.

2341
02:25:15,806 --> 02:25:20,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I wish I got on a week before, but fortunately next week would be my one-year anniversary on WoW.

2342
02:25:21,049 --> 02:25:21,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

2343
02:25:21,969 --> 02:25:23,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really bizarre.

2344
02:25:23,930 --> 02:25:24,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking that up.

2345
02:25:24,630 --> 02:25:25,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of curious.

2346
02:25:25,430 --> 02:25:27,011
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew it was actually next week.

2347
02:25:27,031 --> 02:25:30,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember it got in before the new holiday coming up.

2348
02:25:30,732 --> 02:25:32,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's my TDR version next week.

2349
02:25:32,853 --> 02:25:34,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was almost the same time.

2350
02:25:35,014 --> 02:25:36,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two, get on your three games.

2351
02:25:37,675 --> 02:25:42,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And three, Jamie, what are you planning on playing after you get done with Planes vs. Zombies since you've been addicted to it?

2352
02:25:44,037 --> 02:25:45,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what game?

2353
02:25:45,698 --> 02:25:47,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what game is next for you after this?

2354
02:25:47,579 --> 02:25:50,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing Star Trek Online and Final Fantasy XIII.

2355
02:25:53,952 --> 02:25:55,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've got stuff on my plate.

2356
02:25:56,413 --> 02:25:57,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff I'm playing at the same time.

2357
02:25:57,454 --> 02:25:58,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing Sims 3.

2358
02:25:59,254 --> 02:25:59,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

2359
02:26:00,074 --> 02:26:00,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

2360
02:26:01,735 --> 02:26:02,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2361
02:26:02,555 --> 02:26:03,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, excellent.

2362
02:26:03,175 --> 02:26:05,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I let you go, I just got one message for you.

2363
02:26:06,696 --> 02:26:06,937
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

2364
02:26:09,898 --> 02:26:10,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

2365
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:13,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2366
02:26:13,899 --> 02:26:14,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear it?

2367
02:26:14,359 --> 02:26:14,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really quiet.

2368
02:26:19,561 --> 02:26:20,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny.

2369
02:26:21,249 --> 02:26:22,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's stuck in your head for the rest of the day.

2370
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:24,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much, yes.

2371
02:26:24,290 --> 02:26:24,990
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2372
02:26:25,471 --> 02:26:27,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much a demonic pizza song.

2373
02:26:29,112 --> 02:26:33,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Contact is the moment when everything happens.

2374
02:26:33,733 --> 02:26:34,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Contact.

2375
02:26:34,354 --> 02:26:35,274
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's it.

2376
02:26:35,634 --> 02:26:36,294
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, have a good one.

2377
02:26:36,554 --> 02:26:36,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2378
02:26:36,835 --> 02:26:37,155
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

2379
02:26:37,335 --> 02:26:37,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

2380
02:26:38,942 --> 02:26:39,503
[SPEAKER_08]: What was it?

2381
02:26:39,843 --> 02:26:41,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was 321 Contact.

2382
02:26:41,505 --> 02:26:42,145
[SPEAKER_08]: What was it?

2383
02:26:42,285 --> 02:26:47,951
[SPEAKER_08]: The detective show or something that was part of that show that they had math stuff?

2384
02:26:47,991 --> 02:26:50,193
[SPEAKER_07]: You're thinking of MathNet from Square One TV.

2385
02:26:50,514 --> 02:26:51,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, MathNet.

2386
02:26:51,254 --> 02:26:52,696
[SPEAKER_07]: You're thinking of MathNet.

2387
02:26:53,116 --> 02:26:53,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

2388
02:26:54,037 --> 02:26:54,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to play.

2389
02:26:55,038 --> 02:26:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be all about MathNet.

2390
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:58,321
[SPEAKER_07]: That show was awesome.

2391
02:26:58,461 --> 02:26:59,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.

2392
02:26:59,523 --> 02:27:01,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Friday was the all MathNet show.

2393
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:06,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Square One is pretty cool.

2394
02:27:24,465 --> 02:27:25,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of miss the old shows.

2395
02:27:25,726 --> 02:27:33,991
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call and stop us from playing retro TV songs, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2396
02:27:34,032 --> 02:27:36,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, they have actually all these episodes of MathNet.

2397
02:27:36,613 --> 02:27:37,494
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

2398
02:27:37,634 --> 02:27:40,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to assume probably one of these.

2399
02:27:42,317 --> 02:27:43,138
[SPEAKER_05]: MathNet, frankly.

2400
02:27:43,478 --> 02:27:45,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Walter.

2401
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:47,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2402
02:27:48,742 --> 02:27:49,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?

2403
02:27:51,483 --> 02:27:52,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we'll be right there.

2404
02:27:54,915 --> 02:27:57,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you know what would be awesome?

2405
02:27:57,757 --> 02:27:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Law & Order series.

2406
02:28:00,999 --> 02:28:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Law & Order MathNet.

2407
02:28:07,123 --> 02:28:08,964
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be so awesome.

2408
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:20,692
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on Law & Order, somebody divides by zero.

2409
02:28:26,828 --> 02:28:29,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Juju Rockets Headed for the iPad

2410
02:28:49,630 --> 02:28:51,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising Mobile Capcom Arcade

2411
02:29:08,627 --> 02:29:15,573
[SPEAKER_08]: which will host a bunch of virtual arcade cabinets that require the purchase of tokens to play the games.

2412
02:29:15,593 --> 02:29:16,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2413
02:29:16,634 --> 02:29:20,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, you can permanently access each game for a larger one-time fee.

2414
02:29:21,558 --> 02:29:30,925
[SPEAKER_08]: The arcade service will launch before Dead Rising Mobile and will feature Street Fighter 2, Ghouls and Ghosts, 1942, and Commando.

2415
02:29:31,686 --> 02:29:36,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is why no one else wants to get on board with Game Room because now they're like, well, let's just do our own shit.

2416
02:29:37,110 --> 02:29:37,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

2417
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:38,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no.

2418
02:29:38,991 --> 02:29:42,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Another full motion video game is coming to the App Store as well.

2419
02:29:43,553 --> 02:29:45,033
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is kind of a neat one.

2420
02:29:45,073 --> 02:29:47,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember drawing some of the characters from it.

2421
02:29:47,294 --> 02:29:52,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Braindead 13 is coming as well to the App Store very soon.

2422
02:29:54,698 --> 02:30:00,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Super Monkey Ball, and Phantasy Star 2 are all discounted on iTunes right now.

2423
02:30:01,143 --> 02:30:05,546
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get those all for about $1.99 instead of $6 each.

2424
02:30:05,687 --> 02:30:06,747
[SPEAKER_07]: But they suck on the iPhone.

2425
02:30:07,168 --> 02:30:08,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to mince words.

2426
02:30:08,449 --> 02:30:09,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Monkey Ball is not bad.

2427
02:30:11,091 --> 02:30:28,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll give you that But these other ones, honestly If you have a 360 or a PS3 Go get that Genesis collection The Sonic Mega Genesis collection It's like in the bargain bin right now You can probably find it for $10 And it's fantastic And it's like the greatest $10 you'll spend If you like the retro stuff If you don't like the retro stuff, then don't bother

2428
02:30:29,065 --> 02:30:37,893
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, if that last story sounded interesting to you and you own a 360 or a PS3, go buy the Mega Genesis Collection.

2429
02:30:38,153 --> 02:30:39,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a much better deal.

2430
02:30:40,015 --> 02:30:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.

2431
02:30:41,576 --> 02:30:44,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Minecraft is being updated for Halloween.

2432
02:30:45,099 --> 02:30:47,541
[SPEAKER_07]: They're adding new months.

2433
02:30:47,742 --> 02:30:54,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, I leave the show for two weeks and suddenly, just in general, gaming news in general, suddenly I come back and it's like, Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft.

2434
02:30:54,708 --> 02:30:55,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's talking about Minecraft.

2435
02:30:56,829 --> 02:30:58,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just covering what people want to know.

2436
02:31:18,878 --> 02:31:22,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, it's going to include some new monsters.

2437
02:31:23,682 --> 02:31:34,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, torches that extinguish over time, fishing, and the ability to fast travel by moving through, I guess, a hell world.

2438
02:31:35,111 --> 02:31:36,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And the craftable wristwatch.

2439
02:31:37,894 --> 02:31:42,938
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll let players track how much time is left in the day before the bad guys come out.

2440
02:31:46,038 --> 02:31:49,801
[SPEAKER_07]: 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR

2441
02:32:11,023 --> 02:32:12,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, people, call us!

2442
02:32:12,785 --> 02:32:13,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have the light red.

2443
02:32:14,126 --> 02:32:14,986
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

2444
02:32:15,126 --> 02:32:16,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I had that more rare red color.

2445
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:20,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

2446
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:24,113
[SPEAKER_07]: 877-GAME-OLRR Use name on Skype is Orange Laundry.

2447
02:32:24,433 --> 02:32:32,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it weird to think that everything you're seeing there, that theater that you're seeing all those pictures in, that's now the parking lot for the Best Buy.

2448
02:32:34,461 --> 02:32:35,741
[SPEAKER_07]: You park your cars there now.

2449
02:32:35,822 --> 02:32:36,602
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad.

2450
02:32:37,042 --> 02:32:39,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they have something else that they're building that looks like a theater.

2451
02:32:40,327 --> 02:32:41,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sports authority store.

2452
02:32:42,208 --> 02:32:43,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, lame.

2453
02:32:43,408 --> 02:32:45,889
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the same reaction I had.

2454
02:32:47,030 --> 02:32:49,430
[SPEAKER_07]: No one wants to go to the sports authority.

2455
02:32:50,691 --> 02:32:51,951
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same reaction I had.

2456
02:32:51,991 --> 02:32:53,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Travis Columbia?

2457
02:32:53,812 --> 02:32:55,113
[SPEAKER_07]: In that particular night, yes.

2458
02:32:55,333 --> 02:32:56,753
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.

2459
02:32:56,833 --> 02:33:03,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That particular night was the switch night or tacky horror, they sometimes call it, where the guys play girl parts and the girls play guy parts.

2460
02:33:03,336 --> 02:33:04,696
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why there's pictures of me as Magenta.

2461
02:33:04,796 --> 02:33:06,837
[SPEAKER_07]: You played a good Magenta.

2462
02:33:07,617 --> 02:33:09,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Magenta is my favorite character in the whole movie.

2463
02:33:11,469 --> 02:33:34,095

[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, you did Jessica's in chat saying we need to go do the time warp in the parking lot on February 3rd Because that'll be 10 years since the theater shut down Did you ever pick up that game, was it the Broadway something or other?

2465
02:33:51,029 --> 02:33:53,951
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that's just dance but with all the Broadway songs?

2466
02:33:54,011 --> 02:33:58,575

[SPEAKER_08]: It came out back in June.

2469
02:34:02,416 --> 02:34:06,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine that I've sold a copy of it since.

2470
02:34:06,639 --> 02:34:07,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's it.

2471
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:08,681
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not getting any of the calls tonight.

2472
02:34:08,741 --> 02:34:09,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, people.

2473
02:34:09,441 --> 02:34:10,242
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with you?

2474
02:34:11,082 --> 02:34:12,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's being shy.

[SPEAKER_07]: Call.

02:34:18,047 --> 02:34:18,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut it down.

2481
02:34:18,908 --> 02:34:19,868
[SPEAKER_03]: You all fail.

2482
02:34:21,689 --> 02:34:23,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's in the other room going, terminated.

2483
02:34:23,971 --> 02:34:24,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Dan on the show last week?

2484
02:34:25,012 --> 02:34:25,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he help you kids out?

2485
02:34:26,233 --> 02:34:26,473
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2486
02:34:26,973 --> 02:34:27,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he wasn't.

02:34:28,214 --> 02:34:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2488
02:34:28,954 --> 02:34:29,655

02:34:32,632 --> 02:34:35,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, you want to come be on the show?

[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2491
02:34:36,942 --> 02:34:37,664
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he says no.

2492
02:34:38,486 --> 02:34:38,907
[SPEAKER_07]: How rude.

2493
02:34:40,026 --> 02:34:40,927
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2494
02:35:05,029 --> 02:35:05,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Call 1-8... Call...

2495
02:35:31,287 --> 02:35:33,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on iTunes and leave a nice review for us.

2496
02:35:33,628 --> 02:35:34,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave us an 8.

2497
02:35:35,049 --> 02:35:37,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave us an 8 out of 5 star review on iTunes.

2498
02:35:38,312 --> 02:35:39,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Just tell a couple friends about the show.

2499
02:35:39,993 --> 02:35:43,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Help spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.

2500
02:35:43,796 --> 02:35:47,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just some nerds who do this for fun, who've been doing this way too long.

2501
02:35:48,219 --> 02:35:48,640
[SPEAKER_07]: In a good way.

2502
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, before we pull the plug on the show, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

2503
02:35:53,643 --> 02:35:54,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, start us off tonight.

2504
02:35:54,684 --> 02:35:55,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Your final thought.

2505
02:35:56,305 --> 02:36:03,550
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I am looking forward to getting my new laptop so I can finish my mods for Grand Theft Auto 4.

2506
02:36:03,690 --> 02:36:12,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I am very disappointed that I ran into two people trying to rip me off in auctions and in purchases.

2507
02:36:12,955 --> 02:36:14,615
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2508
02:36:14,635 --> 02:36:15,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I want ice cream.

2509
02:36:38,735 --> 02:36:40,356
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2510
02:37:08,942 --> 02:37:09,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on ice cream.

2511
02:37:10,043 --> 02:37:10,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2512
02:37:10,664 --> 02:37:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to Baskin Robbins.

2513
02:37:11,905 --> 02:37:12,225
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

2514
02:37:12,445 --> 02:37:12,705
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2515
02:37:12,805 --> 02:37:13,166
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2516
02:37:13,226 --> 02:37:13,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.

2517
02:37:13,646 --> 02:37:14,047
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out.

2518
02:37:14,087 --> 02:37:14,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulling the plug.

2519
02:37:14,727 --> 02:37:17,149
[SPEAKER_07]: We will see you here next week for episode 386.

2520
02:37:17,269 --> 02:37:18,851
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be very special.

2521
02:37:18,891 --> 02:37:26,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of look back on 10 years of DDR for me and Iguana Girl, Jessica Harper, whatever other name she has.

2522
02:37:26,577 --> 02:37:28,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think about when my 10th anniversary was.

2523
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You played before me.

2524
02:37:30,401 --> 02:37:30,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that.

2525
02:37:31,222 --> 02:37:31,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2526
02:37:31,462 --> 02:37:34,064
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, I think, started playing a little later, right?

2527
02:37:34,344 --> 02:37:34,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2528
02:37:35,986 --> 02:37:40,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I started playing it was after Fanime one of those years.

2529
02:37:40,091 --> 02:37:41,673
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's early in the year.

2530
02:37:42,875 --> 02:37:44,677
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I don't remember when I started playing.

2531
02:37:44,697 --> 02:37:46,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I had gotten a fourth mix.

2532
02:37:47,341 --> 02:37:48,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I imported a fourth mix.

2533
02:37:49,464 --> 02:37:52,728
[SPEAKER_03]: My first machine was an AX2001 at Disneyland.

2534
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:57,422
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not too far off then, your first machine.

2535
02:37:57,442 --> 02:38:01,625
[SPEAKER_03]: But my first time playing DDR was in December of 99.

2536
02:38:02,646 --> 02:38:04,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, regardless... No, not 99, because I had...

2537
02:38:07,152 --> 02:38:07,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, December 99.

2538
02:38:08,193 --> 02:38:13,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, my first time seeing DDR was Memorial Day of 99.

2539
02:38:13,978 --> 02:38:15,198
[SPEAKER_07]: No, of 2000.

2540
02:38:15,539 --> 02:38:15,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2541
02:38:16,279 --> 02:38:16,459
[SPEAKER_07]: No, 99.

2542
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:19,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I gave you third mix.

2543
02:38:19,962 --> 02:38:21,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that weekend holds other special significance.

2544
02:38:21,784 --> 02:38:22,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave you third mix afterwards.

2545
02:38:23,585 --> 02:38:23,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2546
02:38:24,065 --> 02:38:25,186
[SPEAKER_03]: After you played Machine.

2547
02:38:25,286 --> 02:38:28,469
[SPEAKER_07]: But regardless, we're going to have a 10-year look back next week just because.

2548
02:38:28,529 --> 02:38:28,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

2549
02:38:28,889 --> 02:38:29,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

2550
02:38:29,830 --> 02:38:30,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great night, everybody.

2551
02:38:30,891 --> 02:38:31,511
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.

2552
02:38:31,551 --> 02:38:32,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2553
02:38:32,392 --> 02:38:34,554
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to chastise your boyfriend.

2554
02:38:34,694 --> 02:38:34,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

2555
02:38:34,914 --> 02:38:35,455
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you do?

2556
02:38:35,895 --> 02:38:36,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Sidno Pinkberry.

2557
02:38:37,757 --> 02:38:39,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Lecture, lecture, lecture.

2558
02:38:39,698 --> 02:38:40,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Point, point, point.

2559
02:38:41,079 --> 02:38:41,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Shake, shake, shake.

2560
02:38:42,335 --> 02:38:44,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to San Francisco and get Naya next weekend.

2561
02:38:45,997 --> 02:38:47,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go to a wedding next weekend.

2562
02:38:48,779 --> 02:38:52,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of this, it's all Rocky people that are getting married next week.

2563
02:38:52,261 --> 02:38:53,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a Rocky wedding?

2564
02:38:53,062 --> 02:38:54,543
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually somebody Jessica would know.

2565
02:38:54,563 --> 02:38:55,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to tell her.

2566
02:38:55,343 --> 02:38:56,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a Rocky wedding?

2567
02:38:57,004 --> 02:38:58,065
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not a Rocky themed wedding.

2568
02:38:58,085 --> 02:38:58,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a legit wedding.

2569
02:39:00,066 --> 02:39:00,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no fun.

2570
02:39:01,047 --> 02:39:03,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I'm going to a wedding next weekend.

2571
02:39:03,271 --> 02:39:04,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, but I will be here for the show.

2572
02:39:05,294 --> 02:39:05,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2573
02:39:05,695 --> 02:39:06,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2574
02:39:07,017 --> 02:39:07,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2575
02:39:07,558 --> 02:39:08,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will be here for the show.

2576
02:39:08,519 --> 02:39:09,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, listeners.

2577
02:39:09,221 --> 02:39:11,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you had fun last week, but yes, I'm going to be here.

2578
02:39:11,785 --> 02:39:13,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I play the closing credits now?

2579
02:39:13,327 --> 02:39:13,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

2580
02:39:14,864 --> 02:39:17,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2581
02:39:18,145 --> 02:39:21,407
