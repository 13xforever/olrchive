00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
Tonight, October 10th, 2010, DC Universe Online faces a delay, OnLive gets cheaper to use,

00:20.720 --> 00:32.080
and another classic arcade game is set for revival on this gents consoles.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:36.160 --> 00:37.320
Lounge Radio.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.960
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.440
We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.760
And we don't forget the episode number.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
www.allgames.com.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.560
I always forget the episode number.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.640
It's episode 385 for those that are still counting.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.720
The smartass you hear over there in the corner is my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark

00:56.720 --> 00:58.760
Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.760
How are you?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.840
I'm inhaling bacon fumes and it's not kosher.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.480
I know, this whole room is not kosher at this very moment.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.040
You're helping to balance, give this room kosher balance.

01:10.040 --> 01:14.040
Say hello to the fan of double bacon pizza, Loki.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.480
Because I've tried triple bacon pizza and that's just too much.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.480
That's too much bacon.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
And we did that on a large.

01:18.480 --> 01:23.400
I mean, that was a lot of pizza or a lot of bacon because I remember we're like, I wonder

01:23.400 --> 01:27.080
because there's a, there used to be a guy when I was working at Roundtable that would

01:27.080 --> 01:29.320
order a quadruple sausage pizza.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.520
It literally is like a three quarter inch thick layer of sausage that's just on top

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
of the pizza.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.600
For those that don't know, Roundtable is a big pizza chain on the West Coast.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.880
The whole West Coast or just California?

01:40.880 --> 01:41.880
Mostly California.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.600
You can make it work if you did extra cheese, triple bacon.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
You're right.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.200
The problem was it was too greasy and actually the point is actually you couldn't really

01:51.200 --> 01:52.680
taste the pizza with the bacon.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.780
This is actually really sweet because the sauce is really sweet.

01:55.780 --> 01:59.560
But it might be able to work with like two and a half times bacon.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.960
It would work if it was on a rack.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.120
Do you remember there was an episode probably about two years ago, maybe a year ago, where

02:04.120 --> 02:06.980
you brought like all these bacon dishes to the show?

02:06.980 --> 02:11.240
Like I never thought in my life that I would ever say this is too much bacon.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.240
That was last year.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.240
That was too much bacon.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.240
Was it last year?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
That was my birthday last year.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
That was actually really good.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.240
That was a lot of bacon.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.520
But there was so much bacon left over.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
Yes, there was.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.520
It was too much.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.800
And you guys left it at my house.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.400
I would probably do just like a meat party instead because seriously, bacon, even cooking

02:29.400 --> 02:32.720
it the entire day, it just doesn't get, it's not very good.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.040
Now steak party, that's good.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.240
That sounds like a game that they should sell on the shelves of Target right between like

02:38.240 --> 02:40.080
Blind Date and Mall Madness.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.560
Meat party.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.160
That totally could not be here.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.600
I only eat meat once a month.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.200
Well they'll have to be on that day.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.200
All right.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.200
Anyhow.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.200
Hi.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.360
I missed you guys last week.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.880
My aim is still improving ever so much though.

02:53.880 --> 02:54.880
But you know.

02:54.880 --> 02:55.880
Oh we did fine without you Rob.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
You can just go home if you want.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.880
Okay bye.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.880
No I'm kidding.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.480
No well actually I turned on the show while I was at the airport just to make sure that

03:02.480 --> 03:04.640
you guys like were alive.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.400
Because you didn't trust us.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.360
Well I don't, you'd never had done it before so I just want to make sure you didn't get

03:09.360 --> 03:10.360
into a train wreck.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.520
You know what I mean?

03:11.520 --> 03:14.700
And then you guys, I heard like five seconds of the show, you guys were on the phone with

03:14.700 --> 03:18.240
Aki Ripper and I'm like oh okay they're already into calls so they're done bye.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.760
And then after that everything fell apart.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.760
No it didn't really.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.760
It's because I tuned in.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.760
We kept losing the stream.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.480
It's because I tuned in.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.320
So what did I miss on last week's show?

03:26.320 --> 03:27.920
I have not heard it yet.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.240
And I apologize to the podcastees because they, I mean by the time they hear this they'll

03:31.240 --> 03:32.240
be okay.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
You missed Tiara.

03:33.240 --> 03:36.000
Well I've talked to Tiara before.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I know she's a fun gal.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I enjoy her.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.840
But you missed her fun hosting capabilities.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.660
Did she did she do the Rob role where she kept you all in check?

03:42.660 --> 03:45.200
Make sure you were following the show role?

03:45.200 --> 03:46.200
Did she?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
Yeah.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Yeah.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Great.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.280
I'm sure that show was awesome.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.280
No I'm kidding.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.360
I think I skipped a story once and then we went back and did it.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
All right.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.640
Well I'm glad to hear things were good and that means I can take vacations more often.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.080
It's better than the last time we tried to run the show without you.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.280
Wasn't that the show where you ended up watching like a porno?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.280
Yeah.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.280
Good times.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.280
Good times.

04:10.280 --> 04:15.960
Well I went to Disneyland last week as you guys know and I had a good time and yeah I'm

04:15.960 --> 04:17.680
fresh out of Space Mountain.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.340
But Dark Soccer and I are still trying to get the December 17th thing to work.

04:20.340 --> 04:23.880
We got to just cross the T's and dot the I's and all that stuff.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.720
I have an annual pass again so going back won't be a problem for me.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.560
And I saw some of the pictures from Electronica which started this week and they actually

04:31.560 --> 04:34.720
have a whole little Flynn's arcade with like 80s old school video games.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
We're there.

04:35.720 --> 04:36.720
I know it's gonna be fun.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
We're going.

04:37.720 --> 04:38.720
Good times.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.720
Anyhow.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
No one.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
No one.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
No one.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
And if they try.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.720
Except maybe the bank.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.720
Smite.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.720
Maybe the bank.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.720
The bank could stop us.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.720
All right.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.720
Smite.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.720
Let's start off the show.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.720
Let's see.

04:51.720 --> 04:52.720
We've talked about food.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.720
We've talked about Disneyland.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.720
Is there anything else we talk about on this show?

04:54.720 --> 04:55.720
Oh yeah.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
Video games.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
Once in a while we talk about video games.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.720
How about Rainbow Farting Universe?

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
Here on the show.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.720
No.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
Seriously.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
Someone.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.720
All right.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
I was at Outback last night for my one steak a month.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.720
Quit.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
I quit.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.720
I'm going back to Disneyland.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.720
And I did my.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.720
And someone says, do you need anything else?

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
Do you want anything else?

05:10.720 --> 05:11.720
I say, yeah.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.720
Like a pony, please.

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
And she said, oh.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.720
And the girl said, my friend Jamie always asks for a unicorn that poops rainbows.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.560
And I was like, my name is Jamie.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.200
And she's like, oh wow.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.040
My answer would be, how would you like that cook?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.040
I would.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.040
I guess you had to be there.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.040
All right.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
It was funny.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.040
I'm sleep deprived.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
Rob got.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
Rob brought me caffeine.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.040
Unprompted.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
Well here.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.240
Well, cause I know it puts you in a good mood and I don't wanna have to deal with a bitch

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
Jamie all night.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.240
Anyway.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
Love hearts.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.520
Um, here's the thing.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.520
Here's the thing.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.160
I see some folks in chat complaining that the podcast is not yet uploaded from last

05:48.160 --> 05:49.160
week.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.640
And I swear I'm not doing it out of a spite.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.640
No, here's the deal.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.080
I got like super sick.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.080
I had to miss.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.920
I missed a day at Disneyland due to being sick.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.400
I made Alan go to the park without me on Sunday and I thought I was getting better come Monday.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.940
But then like Tuesday, the day I was supposed to come over and get all the show stuff taken

06:05.940 --> 06:06.940
care of.

06:06.940 --> 06:07.940
I had the worst fever.

06:07.940 --> 06:11.360
I had to call in sick to work and that that's a big deal for me to call in sick to work.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.360
Cause I really don't.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
Rob has amazing work ethic.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.120
Fantastic rib places across the street from Disneyland.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.720
Actually we did eat at Tony Roma's.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.480
Yes, we did eat there actually.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
That's right.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
I haven't seen him in forever.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
Yeah.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
So, all right.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
Anyhow.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.920
Tony Stark's house of ribs.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.520
All right.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.800
I'm just reading the chat and a salacious pop is just going, wow, Rob, you can't.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.880
I was, I was mean to Jamie.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.520
I didn't mean it.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.520
Come on.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.160
You guys, I have to, I have to razzle on the show.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.160
I got him.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.320
I got last week to make up for.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.880
Come on you guys.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.320
And your, your mic sucks.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
That is not a lie.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.920
I went, you went to the place without me.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.920
I know.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.920
I'm sorry.

06:54.920 --> 06:55.920
All right.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.780
Let's talk about, cause we do talk about video games once in a while on the show.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.860
How was your gaming week and dark soccer?

07:00.860 --> 07:01.860
How was your game?

07:01.860 --> 07:03.120
We, we really, really do need to get the mic cord.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.560
I thought for some reason my cord here, I pushed it out last week.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.560
All right.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
We'll just get anyone.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.120
I think it got loose is what it is.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.120
It's loose.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.120
Like a hoo-er.

07:12.120 --> 07:18.760
Um, I, I was going to play Final Fantasy 13 and didn't.

07:18.760 --> 07:23.840
Dan's been in there with our friend George over here playing Halo Reach all day and I

07:23.840 --> 07:28.560
played Star Trek online and I'm doing, I've got actually until tomorrow to finish the

07:28.560 --> 07:35.360
other three missions in this whole Breen thing so that I can get my free Breen tactical officer

07:35.360 --> 07:39.460
because I have a shit ton of homework to do the rest of the week.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.040
So J busy, Jamie is busy.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.560
Um, I played lots of plants versus zombies.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.560
I played in our bacular drop, which we know that is right.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
Yeah.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.680
The bonus moments in the game, right?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.680
The precursor to portal.

07:52.680 --> 08:01.640
Oh, the game that, oh yeah, I'm not any good at it and it's like, it's a neat concept.

08:01.640 --> 08:08.240
I mean, but I'm glad that portal made it less, uh, Clippy, if you know what I mean with fewer

08:08.240 --> 08:10.200
trolls in it.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.520
Um, and then what else did I play?

08:15.520 --> 08:21.120
Um, no, a lot of plants versus zombies, a whole lot of plants versus zombies.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
You beat it yet.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
I don't know.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
Yeah.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
Is it beatable?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.120
I don't know.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.120
Yeah.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
You can beat adventure mode and then you do it again.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.120
I've played it a couple of times, but never for an extended period of time.

08:29.120 --> 08:35.500
So now I'm trying to do the, uh, the no fungus among us achievement where you don't use fungus

08:35.500 --> 08:37.120
at night or something.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.120
I don't know.

08:39.120 --> 08:45.000
Um, no, no, I know I played something else.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I just can't remember what it is.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.680
Dan's played a whole lot of Mega Man.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
Like old school Mega Man?

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
Like NES Mega Man?

08:50.680 --> 08:51.920
Mega Man 4 Game Boy edition.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.380
That's random.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.600
What makes a person think I want to play Mega Man 4 on the Game Boy?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.000
He's been watching Mega Man playthroughs.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, okay.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So my husband's a dork.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
All right.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Heart.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.240
I think the Mega Man collection on a GameCube is still an awesome game to have because you

09:05.240 --> 09:07.800
know those GameCubes can, you can still play them on the Wii.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
Yeah.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.320
So it's still a good collection to have or the PS2, whatever, whatever one you want.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.600
Some people don't like the GameCube one cause I think the buttons are swapped or something.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
So but it's fine.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.600
It doesn't bother me.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
Either way is fine.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.880
You're not bothered Rob.

09:19.880 --> 09:20.880
No.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.680
And um, I've been keeping Super Metroid all warm and cozy for you.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.680
Awesome.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.680
Yeah.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
We played a little bit of that last.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.440
Cause I wasn't here on the last show, but I don't know if you mentioned it, but yeah,

09:30.440 --> 09:31.840
I came over at like that Tuesday.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.840
We played some Super Metroid.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.840
It was good times.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.680
And we beat turtle after you left.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Did you?

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
Yeah.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
Good times.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.680
I had to switch to Donatello.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.160
I like the long stick.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.160
Oh my.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.960
Loki, how was your gaming week?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.120
Um, it was okay.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.120
I didn't play a whole lot.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.120
I played mainly uh, Grand Theft Auto.

09:52.120 --> 09:56.080
Um, you know, more Grand Theft Auto 4, Lost and Damned.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.240
Still play more multiplayer.

09:57.240 --> 10:02.880
I am really pissing off my coworkers because I'm, I keep winning a lot and I've actually

10:02.880 --> 10:09.100
had to draft up a printed out form letter for apologies for beating them at certain

10:09.100 --> 10:12.180
things that I, I fill out.

10:12.180 --> 10:18.160
So um, I don't know if that adds insult to injury or what, but it's what they requested.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.360
So I'm sorry that you suck.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.280
That sounds like you had to like make your amends to your coworkers.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.400
Like it's because, okay, the game is so lagging out.

10:28.400 --> 10:33.520
Like um, I think they shut down some servers or something when they're, when they moved

10:33.520 --> 10:36.880
on to new expansion and Red Dead Redemption, that kind of stuff.

10:36.880 --> 10:42.720
So the game, it gets a little laggy sometimes and sometimes things just seem to go my way.

10:42.720 --> 10:48.080
Like um, you know, they'll be coming to attack me and all of a sudden a car hits them and

10:48.080 --> 10:54.040
they get knocked over and I turn around and shoot them in the face or uh, I, you know,

10:54.040 --> 10:58.960
my big thing now that I've been come, you know, kind of become fascinated with is climbing

10:58.960 --> 10:59.960
up buildings.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.440
Like I'm totally this like massive free runner in that damn game now.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.440
It's ridiculous.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.840
Like the, how the fuck did you get on top of that skyscraper?

11:07.840 --> 11:08.840
It's like you're Spiderman.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.360
It's seriously, I'm like Spiderman in that game.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.360
It's ridiculous.

11:12.360 --> 11:19.620
Um, and there's a lot of places in, especially in Algonquin that you can just climb up to

11:19.620 --> 11:24.540
the top of buildings and there's so many like fire escapes you can get to and it's ridiculous.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.760
So you had to write your coworkers apology letters.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.760
Like were they like at the point where, we're not playing with you again cause you're a

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
jerk.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.760
They're getting pretty pissed off at me.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.760
It's bad.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.840
It's, it sounds like you had to write your amends letters.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.180
Like one of the things I was doing when I was sick is I was watching a lot of intervention

11:39.180 --> 11:43.960
on A&E and one of the episodes I was watching was the follow up episode to the chick that

11:43.960 --> 11:44.960
inhales computer duster.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.840
Did you ever see this episode of the chick who inhales the computer duster?

11:47.840 --> 11:51.760
It's like I'm walking on sunshine.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.760
She's walking on sunshine.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.040
It's like I'm walking on sunshine.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.880
But anyways, inhaling computer duster, it's toughing.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.880
It's toughing.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.560
It's some way kids get high and it's really dangerous.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.560
Don't do it.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
Really, really dangerous.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
Like you do a whipped cream.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
I guess.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
Yeah, like that whole thing.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
So that's where that South Park thing came from.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.560
Yes.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.560
That's where the towel thing on South Park comes from.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.120
But anyway, they had like a follow up episode to her and she, as part of the follow up,

12:14.120 --> 12:15.260
she's, she's all better now.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.920
So, you know, hooray for her.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.480
And she's, she's not doing that stuff anymore.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.600
One thing she had to do was make amends.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.720
So she had to like write a letter to the police.

12:21.720 --> 12:25.240
Like, I'm sorry, I put up a fight when you try to arrest me and dah, dah, dah.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.720
And write to the people at Walmart.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.020
I'm sorry that I would come in every day and buy 10 cans of computer duster.

12:30.020 --> 12:33.160
So like it sounds like Loki is like having to write amends to his coworkers.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.880
Like I'm sorry that I repeatedly beat your ass at Grand Theft Auto and I'm sorry you

12:37.880 --> 12:39.520
can't handle it.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.360
Sorry you suck.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.480
It's not necessary.

12:43.480 --> 12:48.480
It's only when like, you know, really ridiculous things happen that, you know, shouldn't happen

12:48.480 --> 12:50.320
normally in the circumstances of the game.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.640
So I don't know, whatever.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.880
Other things I played other than Grand Theft Auto, I did play a little bit of Dead Rising

12:57.880 --> 12:58.880
2.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.840
And I really do mean a little bit.

13:00.840 --> 13:07.960
I mean I only got to the part where they get into the, what is it, the shelter and that's

13:07.960 --> 13:08.960
it.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.800
I mean that's like literally five minutes into the game.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.800
It's cool though.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.400
I am really excited to play the rest of the game.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.040
I just really pressed on time.

13:18.040 --> 13:22.880
The other thing of course, obviously since I have my iPod with me a lot during work hours

13:22.880 --> 13:27.880
and you know, when I'm watching the baby, I've been playing a lot of Geared, which is

13:27.880 --> 13:31.280
a puzzle game with gears that you have to move different gears around to try to get

13:31.280 --> 13:32.960
all the gears to spin.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.520
And it's pretty fun.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.720
It's kind of addicting.

13:36.720 --> 13:44.940
I am digging though this one app on there called the free app watcher, or free app tracker.

13:44.940 --> 13:50.060
And they'll basically track or let you know when apps drop in price to free.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.280
So you can go on there and browse through there and download games that would normally

13:53.280 --> 13:57.920
cost you money because they're either trying to promote them or whatever.

13:57.920 --> 14:03.240
So that's kind of cool, a great way to get a bunch of free shit.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.880
So yeah, that's pretty much what I've been playing.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.440
I'm excited to get a new laptop this week that will actually be able to run Grand Theft

14:08.440 --> 14:12.720
Auto on it so I can do my editing at work because that's really the only time I'd actually

14:12.720 --> 14:17.480
have to do mods for the Xbox 360 version.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.960
Plus I can run other things on there and I'm possibly going to download Minecraft now since

14:21.960 --> 14:23.800
everybody keeps talking about it and I got to see what this thing is.

14:23.800 --> 14:27.680
I somehow missed the boat on all this Minecraft stuff because it's just really happened in

14:27.680 --> 14:32.160
the past couple weeks, but why is everybody all gung ho about Minecraft?

14:32.160 --> 14:34.160
I somehow missed this while I was on vacation.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.880
It went free for a while while they were fixing some server issues or something and once people

14:37.880 --> 14:39.680
start playing they're like, oh my god, it's addictive.

14:39.680 --> 14:44.720
It's basically a game you go in and you create stuff.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.720
And then there's monsters.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.440
There's a lot of games like that in there.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.720
Well yeah, but this is really addicting apparently.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.720
Okay, I'll have to try it.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
I mean, don't knock it till you try it.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
I've heard a lot of things about it.

14:52.720 --> 14:57.160
To the point where there's someone like recreating the Star Trek Enterprise full scale in the

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
game.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
That's cool.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.640
So it's kind of like Legos but a game.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
Something like that.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.920
It's like Leo Universe, but not.

15:04.920 --> 15:09.120
We've created a new game in the chat called Poopville.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.840
I'm looking at our chat room chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday

15:12.840 --> 15:16.440
evening and that's chat.orangelandraday.com and I see all this talk about Farmville.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.640
I think the whole talk about addiction and intervention.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.920
My mom's addicted to Farmville.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.920
Wow.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.000
And I'm looking at a defective candy in our chat room.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
That's not a name I've seen before.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't think so.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Hi.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.180
I just shake my head with shame whenever someone comes in and buys one of those Farmville cards

15:30.180 --> 15:33.920
for work and like wow people really do buy those.

15:33.920 --> 15:38.280
But you know what actually I can relate this to Disneyland a little bit.

15:38.280 --> 15:42.280
You know I do the pin trading at Disneyland and I always buy like a generic pin set to

15:42.280 --> 15:46.800
trade away to people to because the employees trade with you and it's this whole little

15:46.800 --> 15:49.280
like weird game you play while you're at the parks.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.280
So I bought a pack of starter pins and you know what the pack was that I bought of starter

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
pins?

15:54.280 --> 15:56.000
Club Penguin.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.100
And like almost all day long people kept asking me like what are those pins?

16:00.100 --> 16:01.100
What is it?

16:01.100 --> 16:04.360
And I'm having to like explain Club Penguin to people which is weird because I've never

16:04.360 --> 16:05.360
played it.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.380
But it's one of those like Disney style Farmville-esque MMOs and they sell those cards right next

16:10.380 --> 16:11.740
to the Farmville cards at the store.

16:11.740 --> 16:13.760
But it's more for kids because it's Disney.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.880
So yeah people actually buy that stuff.

16:16.880 --> 16:21.720
But I mean the kids stuff I get because the kids stuff you really have to ration.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.120
I get that a little more but the adult stuff it's like oh boy.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.120
Oh boy.

16:26.120 --> 16:31.680
Yeah so again if you want to join us in chat chat.orangelaundryday.com.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.360
Anything else you want to mention about your gaming week?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.360
Loki are you all done?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.360
You all done?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.360
I'm done.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.360
All right.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.280
I don't think I have a whole lot for my gaming week I gotta be honest since I was out for

16:40.280 --> 16:43.200
five days and then I was sick I didn't do a whole lot of gaming.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.200
Just a lot of sleeping.

16:44.200 --> 16:48.760
I did play some more World of Warcraft because you know I'm a little yeah shut up.

16:48.760 --> 16:52.020
Hey my guild is nine of twelve now in ICC finally.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.020
We're almost there.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.020
Sounds like a Borg designation.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.200
Doesn't it?

16:55.200 --> 16:58.960
We just have to get Putricide and Cindergosa and then we'll be on our way to the Lich King.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.120
So we're progressing along nicely there.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.280
I did a 25 man run over the weekend that was it was interesting.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.200
It got a little it was a little slow to start so in a little later than I thought.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.260
I don't feel so bad about my Breen thing now.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.260
What's that?

17:12.260 --> 17:13.260
Your what thing?

17:13.260 --> 17:14.260
Breen.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.260
What's that?

17:15.260 --> 17:16.260
They're a race in Star Trek.

17:16.260 --> 17:19.640
Oh is this like a thing you're trying to like you have to grind a lot to get to play them

17:19.640 --> 17:20.640
or?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.640
No no.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.800
And I'll tell everyone right now who's playing Star Trek online.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.060
They have me they're having a special that if you do the Breen episodes there's five

17:27.060 --> 17:32.480
of them when you finish the last episode you get a Breen tactical officer.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.480
Only until the 14th.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.480
Wow.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
So that's what I'm doing.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.240
Only I've got tomorrow to finish it.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.240
Random.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.620
I'm sorry but I'm saying now I don't feel so bad about my Breen.

17:40.620 --> 17:41.720
That's all right.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.760
There's holiday events and wow that are just as bad.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.760
So yeah it's mostly been that because you know I was away for five days and then I was

17:46.760 --> 17:49.160
sick and everything so I haven't been playing a whole lot.

17:49.160 --> 17:53.000
Plus I spent a lot more at Disneyland than I should have.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.380
So I've been scaling back in other ways like I was going to get the Castlevania game this

17:56.380 --> 17:59.040
week but I've heard mixed things on it anyway.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.480
I've heard it's not so hot like that's that's the general reaction I've been seeing on Facebook.

18:03.480 --> 18:09.620
And I actually resisted buying Final Fantasy 14 which has been getting some really mixed

18:09.620 --> 18:10.620
reviews online.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.620
Have you seen this?

18:11.620 --> 18:16.560
Like some websites like I think GameSpot gave it a four like.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.160
But some websites have been giving it like eights.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.080
So it's it's really hit and miss Final Fantasy 14.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.540
It's interesting.

18:22.540 --> 18:26.960
So I will talk a little bit briefly then some of the games I was able to play since I was

18:26.960 --> 18:30.400
like you know at the airport and stuff I did play a quite a few iPhone games.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.040
So just really quick I know not everyone's into this but I'll mention a couple things

18:33.040 --> 18:34.680
I played that came out.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.580
Stardunk is totally free.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.840
It's this basketball kind of game but not really like I don't want you to think it's

18:39.840 --> 18:42.800
like a NBA type game because it's not.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.400
It's like it reminds me a little more of those like old school tank shooting games because

18:47.400 --> 18:52.320
you like kind of use your finger to pick like an angle and a power and then you just try

18:52.320 --> 18:55.600
to fire a ball in the basket as many times as you can but the ball keeps moving around

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
the screen.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.260
And it's like online and all this uber stuff with it.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.260
So it's pretty cool.

19:00.260 --> 19:01.920
BitTrip Beat came out on the iPhone.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.800
This game will set you back five bucks.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.480
That's a little much I think considering there are so many games out there that are 99 cents

19:08.480 --> 19:09.480
and free.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.480
I talked about this last week because I actually played it last week.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.480
Oh did you?

19:11.480 --> 19:12.480
What did you think?

19:12.480 --> 19:13.480
I dislike.

19:13.480 --> 19:17.440
I never really cared for the Wii controls you know how you had to tilt the remote to

19:17.440 --> 19:21.200
get you know the stuff to go back and your little paddle to go back and forth.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.600
And I really don't like it on the iPod or iPhone.

19:24.600 --> 19:30.060
I'd rather use my finger to move it up and down and because that would be a lot more

19:30.060 --> 19:33.680
accurate but it you can't and it's annoying.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.640
It was I mean the tilt thing was fine for me.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.840
I enjoyed it.

19:36.840 --> 19:41.240
I still think it's a good game and it's weird that like I'll pay ten dollars on it for the

19:41.240 --> 19:44.560
on the Wii but then I sit here and go but five dollars on the iPhone is too much.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.040
But I think we just get accustomed to these different pricing things when there's so many

19:48.040 --> 19:51.840
games out on the iPhone that are free or like three dollars or less.

19:51.840 --> 19:57.480
Like your game has to be really good to justify a five dollar or even like ten dollar premium.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.600
It's Sonic 4 they want like $9.99 for that right?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
Okay.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.920
No I am not paying that much.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.360
But would you pay fifteen for it on the PS3?

20:05.360 --> 20:06.360
No I wouldn't.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.560
Oh okay.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.440
I wouldn't.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.700
And why is that Loki?

20:10.700 --> 20:11.700
Why is that?

20:11.700 --> 20:12.700
Why is that?

20:12.700 --> 20:14.240
Because I've played it and it's terrible.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
Really?

20:15.240 --> 20:16.240
Yeah.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.240
I didn't trade it at E3 enough.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.240
It was fine.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.240
But here's the thing though.

20:19.240 --> 20:24.040
I'm not a real big fan of Sonic games so I you know maybe that's not for me to judge.

20:24.040 --> 20:29.760
Personally I think like games like Sonic Colors or the good parts of Sonic Unleashed actually

20:29.760 --> 20:32.480
seem more interesting to me.

20:32.480 --> 20:37.040
It's just I don't know it he moves too fast for a platforming game.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.980
That's my opinion.

20:38.980 --> 20:42.800
But they're taken out like it's kind of funny because the version I have is like a beta

20:42.800 --> 20:45.960
and so some of the levels that were in there like remember that mine cart level or whatever

20:45.960 --> 20:49.120
that's not actually going to appear in the 360 version anymore.

20:49.120 --> 20:54.840
It's only in the iPhone, iPod versions because they have tilt controls or in the Wii version

20:54.840 --> 20:56.120
I guess.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.200
Weird.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.440
And I know we'll get into stuff later I'm not sure if the story.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.880
Yeah there's some Sonic 4 stuff on the show later but.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.760
And that that's ridiculous.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.760
I'm sorry.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.680
We'll get there when we get there sorry I just I do think it's interesting though that

21:08.680 --> 21:12.440
it came out on the iPhone first like I'm sure you guys have heard Sonic 4 is out on the

21:12.440 --> 21:15.360
iPhone now and it's not out on consoles till this week right?

21:15.360 --> 21:20.880
I'll probably buy it on consoles anyway just because I'm a consumer whore yay you know

21:20.880 --> 21:21.880
and how exactly.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.600
Well if you like the old school Sonic games.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
I love the old school Sonic.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
Then you'll probably like it.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
I will.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.240
I didn't care for the old I like Sonic 1 that was alright and Sonic and Knuckles was kind

21:30.240 --> 21:34.940
of fun but I don't know I just don't like Sonic too much.

21:34.940 --> 21:38.960
The Dreamcast one recently came out on the 360 as well and I did play that a little bit

21:38.960 --> 21:39.960
a couple weeks ago.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.960
And apparently that was a terrible port as well.

21:40.960 --> 21:41.960
It was okay.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.520
Well actually I know I took that back it wasn't a terrible.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.720
It isn't the same game to me at all.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.840
It's just not the same game to me at all.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.880
Well like people are complaining about like graphics and stuff in there I'm like it's

21:51.880 --> 21:55.520
a Dreamcast game when you expect I mean come on.

21:55.520 --> 22:01.600
Because you're taking a game that you remember from your tiny TV in your bedroom that was

22:01.600 --> 22:07.720
hooked up with the RCA red yellow white cables or maybe even like the RF adapters like you

22:07.720 --> 22:11.440
know minimal graphical ability for this day and age and now you're putting it on your

22:11.440 --> 22:12.720
HDTV.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.120
Well every flaw you're going to see now and every rough polygon that was smooth before

22:17.120 --> 22:19.760
because the old TVs weren't as crisp.

22:19.760 --> 22:24.520
And your expectations back then were way lower I mean remember when the Nintendo 64 stuff

22:24.520 --> 22:32.800
came out and hell even before that you know just even some of the I don't know like 3D

22:32.800 --> 22:37.760
stuff on even like the mode 7 stuff sometimes like even Mario Kart and stuff it's like oh

22:37.760 --> 22:39.360
my god this is so awesome.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.600
You know that's why some people can't get into the retro gaming like you know and I'm

22:43.600 --> 22:49.040
like oh Game Room is awesome because like Atari 2600 games on your HDTV like you can't

22:49.040 --> 22:54.000
hook up an Atari 2600 to your HDTV anymore without some major rigging going on that's

22:54.000 --> 22:55.800
going to cause loss of quality.

22:55.800 --> 23:01.100
But like you know these Atari 2600 games are crisp on my HDTV.

23:01.100 --> 23:05.120
Yes I know that's kind of weird because it's not like 2600 games were known for their graphics

23:05.120 --> 23:06.600
but it's kind of neat.

23:06.600 --> 23:11.440
You know I don't know and in fact not everybody gets that and that's okay that's why.

23:11.440 --> 23:16.180
You heard you heard what they're doing with what Capcom is planning on doing with the

23:16.180 --> 23:20.640
iPhone stuff they're planning on doing something like Game Room but with the Capcom games.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.720
Oh interesting.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.120
As long as Quiz and Dragons is in there I'm game.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.120
Probably.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.120
Quiz and Dragons was awesome.

23:26.120 --> 23:30.120
It was it ran on the same hardware as it was either CPS 1 or 2 I can't remember what's

23:30.120 --> 23:31.600
the one that Street Fighter 2 is on?

23:31.600 --> 23:34.480
Street Fighter 2 is CPS 2.

23:34.480 --> 23:38.160
All the okay Quiz and Dragons was on this it was Magic Sword Final Fight they were all

23:38.160 --> 23:39.160
on that same engine.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.160
Yeah.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.160
Quiz and Dragons was awesome.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.160
Just saying look it up.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.840
All right anyhow I think I need to bribe Dark Soccer to make that a classic game of the

23:45.840 --> 23:46.840
week at some point.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
Which one?

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
Just saying Quiz and Dragons.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
You know I never played it.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.840
Really?

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
Yeah.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
It's neat.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.080
It's in one of those Capcom collections it's it's hard now because all the trivia questions

23:56.080 --> 23:57.560
are like from 92.

23:57.560 --> 24:03.920
They're like who is president now it's like oh no I think it was Clinton was it all right

24:03.920 --> 24:09.240
anyhow let's get into some housekeeping then we'll get into some actual news what are you

24:09.240 --> 24:13.680
doing Dark Star are you playing your I was looking at Minecraft it looks irritating it

24:13.680 --> 24:19.440
looks like an old school like doom make your own doom type of thing see that right there

24:19.440 --> 24:25.200
is what I imagine ZZT would look like if they did it nowadays oh now you just sold me this

24:25.200 --> 24:30.660
is this like ZZT is this like a new ZZT because if so you basically can make your you you

24:30.660 --> 24:39.040
dig and you can harvest stuff and you can create objects you can dig holes you can dig

24:39.040 --> 24:42.920
holes wait wait wait and you build up hold on hold on hold on Jamie pick up your mic

24:42.920 --> 24:47.200
I don't understand it's just fucking me you will sit there and play The Sims for God knows

24:47.200 --> 24:55.560
how long but this is just fucking holes I'm not playing dress-up but okay I don't get

24:55.560 --> 25:00.960
it you can basically look at the videos on YouTube and stuff you can create houses and

25:00.960 --> 25:07.640
stuff and forts and later on not the spoil anything there's monsters ladies at the close

25:07.640 --> 25:13.920
page there's monsters that come that you have to defend you know your little house or castle

25:13.920 --> 25:20.920
or whatever the hell you decide to make in it and you can get torches that keep the evil

25:20.920 --> 25:25.920
things away it's like it's it's a whole big you know it's almost like a little bit tower

25:25.920 --> 25:33.200
defense with a little bit of like crafting an MMO with a little bit of big planet you

25:33.200 --> 25:38.360
know it's a little of everything it's just people like it because it can be extremely

25:38.360 --> 25:43.480
creative in it and it's one of those games that never really ends all right chat that

25:43.480 --> 25:47.600
orange is ready to calm lots of comments Tiger Claw says and many of the Atari 2600 games

25:47.600 --> 25:52.240
are two-player online and no ability to play with others online with it I agree game room

25:52.240 --> 25:57.060
has huge flaws and that's why it's not doing as well as you think it would and that's one

25:57.060 --> 26:02.640
of them and it's very very sad because now nobody's gonna attempt it again this generation

26:02.640 --> 26:06.920
and that makes me very sad that they had such a great idea and then kind of made these few

26:06.920 --> 26:12.480
key decisions that just kind of ruin it boo hiss let's see salacious pop says minecraft

26:12.480 --> 26:18.920
is item creation heaven hell you dig you build you explore you defend you resource farm forever

still love game room despite its faults you know that's kind of where I'm at too is that

27:20.760 --> 27:26.340
you know despite its faults I do love the retro goodness that it brings out so it's

27:26.340 --> 27:30.640
like you have to love it although boy they're really reaching now with some of these games

27:30.640 --> 27:33.840
they're putting out they're running out I don't think they were able to bring any other

27:33.840 --> 27:39.740
publishers on board that's kind of sad let's see oh and people are reminding me act F

27:39.740 --> 27:43.920
says 42 equals life the universe and everything that's right because 10 10 10 in binary is

27:43.920 --> 27:49.520
42 which is the answer some of you guys need to really get over numerology thing I'm just

27:49.520 --> 27:55.600
saying no no no it has nothing to do numerology did you ever read hitchhiker's guide ah like

27:55.600 --> 27:59.240
bits and pieces but never the whole thing okay I will explain this in a nutshell the

27:59.240 --> 28:03.640
earth was created to be a supercomputer to figure out the meaning of life or the answer

28:03.640 --> 28:10.200
to life or something and before it got destroyed it only it got as far as 42 interesting so

28:10.200 --> 28:17.680

jack on the 3do and I also played um road rash on 3do road rash is cool maybe road rash

29:29.000 --> 29:33.640
is what I was thinking of not mega race um he may have had mega races all around that

29:33.640 --> 29:38.520
same time period anyways so they're putting out this new handheld console that's called

29:38.520 --> 29:45.320
the jungle and it apparently has a full uh qwerty keyboard a high res display plus a

29:45.320 --> 29:53.280
touch sensitive d-pad and buttons and um apparently they're gonna be they're like they said they're

29:53.280 --> 30:00.160
gearing it for um mmos the thing runs linux um so it's obviously gonna be able to run

30:00.160 --> 30:08.900
other things but honestly I don't know many mmos that run natively in linux so it's nice

30:08.900 --> 30:16.960
that you made a console for mmos that don't yet really exist for the console well but

30:16.960 --> 30:21.560
they get a lot of stuff to run on linux does wow run on linux I don't think it does I think

30:21.560 --> 30:26.440
it's just pc and mac like I know blizzard people have gotten to run in the uh gnome

30:26.440 --> 30:32.280
I mean at the gnome the whatever the virtual environment is wine interesting um it also

30:32.280 --> 30:39.400
comes with a mini hdmi port a mini usb port um headphone jack of course um is kind of

30:39.400 --> 30:45.000
thick looking um people say it looks kind of like the n gauge I don't know if I'd compare

30:45.000 --> 30:54.480
to the n gauge um and funny enough they uh unveiled it on the mtv show to which this

30:54.480 --> 31:04.080
at this point I was unaware of uh rob looks like rob uh deer decks fantasy factory yeah

31:04.080 --> 31:09.820
I don't know anything about that show wow yeah huh it's a long way from downtown julie

31:09.820 --> 31:15.160
brown that's all says um I guess along with the system Panasonic is launching a Battlestar

31:15.160 --> 31:21.800
Galactica title for the device and a web show called online underground I wonder if it's

31:21.800 --> 31:26.360
that same Battlestar Galactica mmo I saw at e3 because that looked kind of neat I don't

31:26.360 --> 31:34.640
know um it looks neat I mean if it actually supported you know mmo's or something you

31:34.640 --> 31:37.480
need to the point where it would be able to run them without any sort of lag or something

31:37.480 --> 31:41.540
that might not be bad um I could see this almost as something that you could say for

31:41.540 --> 31:47.120
example stream something kind of like the on live stuff maybe you know have this portable

31:47.120 --> 31:51.160
device with you it connects to the web and you can stream say something from your pc

31:51.160 --> 31:55.000
so you can play an mmo on it or something I bet you know with all this on live stuff

31:55.000 --> 31:58.240
I bet we're only a couple of years away from seeing something just like that if this isn't

31:58.240 --> 32:01.780
it that's a really good thought is that you know pretty soon these handheld devices will

32:01.780 --> 32:07.000
be able to stream heck the psp actually will stream from your ps3 but not in the way you

32:07.000 --> 32:12.240
think like you can't play games over it or anything but you know you can like get files

32:12.240 --> 32:18.360
can you well you can do like the ps1 game no ps3 games no I tried it before you can't

32:18.360 --> 32:22.680
do yes you can that must be doing something wrong you are doing something wrong you play

32:22.680 --> 32:27.800
ps3 games really yes huh I've been I've been doing something wrong this whole time now

32:27.800 --> 32:33.080
granted it's certain ps3 games you can play that are compatible but that's why it's only

32:33.080 --> 32:38.400
a certain one now certain psp games or ps3 games they have built in where you can stream

32:38.400 --> 32:45.200
that and you can actually play it um however also with the recent hacks to the ps3 they

32:45.200 --> 32:50.960
have enabled that on all games but the thing is it really comes down to um it comes down

32:50.960 --> 32:57.320
to the control set whether the control set will work with what's limited on the psp but

32:57.320 --> 33:03.120
yeah anything is possible um with the ps3 you can you know play any of the psp game

33:03.120 --> 33:08.640
or ps3 games on the psp hmm and I bet most people don't even know that type of functionality

33:08.640 --> 33:15.120
exists because sony would rather market these other features that you know yeah but um they

33:15.120 --> 33:18.680
I don't I don't know when I when I hear of this thing and I see this thing and and you

33:18.680 --> 33:23.120
describing it I don't think of this as like a handheld gaming device in a way I can pretty

33:23.120 --> 33:28.720
large well I file this under the ipad competitor department doesn't this I mean to me yeah

33:28.720 --> 33:32.880
it doesn't have a touch screen or anything but it seems more ipad esque where it's more

33:32.880 --> 33:38.880
of like a computer that runs linux because if it runs linux then who's to say I can just

33:38.880 --> 33:44.160
run mmos on it I mean couldn't I do spreadsheets on it it's possible right so it's more of

33:44.160 --> 33:48.400
a computer than a gaming device I guess it's all in the way they're marketing it maybe

33:48.400 --> 33:55.600
but it just seems strange to me Sony try to play off the ps3 as a computer yeah but I

33:55.600 --> 33:59.880
don't know that was different because it's not like well I get but you could run linux

33:59.880 --> 34:05.760
on the ps3 at least for a limited time it can't anymore but I don't think I don't know

34:05.760 --> 34:09.880
how many people really use that feature I mean when they took it out certainly there

34:09.880 --> 34:15.720
was that core group of hackers and folks that were very upset and then what the the military

34:15.720 --> 34:20.200
had been using it or something is the the processors and those things are disgustingly

34:20.200 --> 34:26.560
fast so it's kind of like a really cheap supercomputer but you know most people didn't get a ps3

34:26.560 --> 34:34.040
to run linux on it most people did most people got it to be a cheap blu-ray player I see

34:34.040 --> 34:40.680
it anyway yeah no all right well speaking of mmos whether this one will run on this

34:40.680 --> 34:45.480
device or not I don't know but the biggest one world of warcraft at least here in the

34:45.480 --> 34:51.200
US has a release date for its next expansion that's right the cataclysm will be starting

34:51.200 --> 34:56.640
on December 7th that's where world of warcraft cataclysm will hit stores it's going to be

34:56.640 --> 35:01.860
$40 when it comes out there will be a collector's edition for $80 that comes with an art book

35:01.860 --> 35:07.760
commentary dvd soundtrack cd mouse pad trading cards and a little in-game pet called lil

35:07.760 --> 35:12.840
deathwing so you can go out and run that and run out and buy that in stores or and I find

35:12.840 --> 35:17.460
this very interesting we all kind of saw this coming after starcraft 2 they will be doing

35:17.460 --> 35:23.860
digital download with this that strikes me as kind of amazing because they're not going

35:23.860 --> 35:29.400
to have those awesome media opportunities of folks lining out lining up outside of stores

35:29.400 --> 35:34.280
and all that unless I guess they're just getting the collector's edition but people are surprised

35:34.280 --> 35:40.000
people are like pissed off that those collector's editions are really rare right now it's kind

35:40.000 --> 35:46.520
of like I guess any of the other expansions it's just interesting to me that you know

35:46.520 --> 35:50.560
they're going to go ahead and go the digital distribution route and kind of I don't know

35:50.560 --> 35:54.360
it seems a little bit controversial but blizzard in the pc market can also kind of get away

35:54.360 --> 35:57.680
with doing whatever it wants right now so well they don't want their sales limited by

35:57.680 --> 36:01.240
the number of physical copies that are out there maybe they feel they can't put them

36:01.240 --> 36:04.320
out fast enough I don't know maybe because you're gonna have a lot of people who want

36:04.320 --> 36:07.880
this day one I mean most of the sales will be in the first couple weeks there's not gonna

36:07.880 --> 36:10.920
be a lot of people that are gonna wait till Christmas that's why and by the way I just

36:10.920 --> 36:14.600
just want to remind you kindly I told you this game was going to come out mid-december

36:14.600 --> 36:19.040
like three months ago because blizzard can do whatever they want with actually blizzard

36:19.040 --> 36:25.080
told us that it was coming out mid-december like in february and then they what moved

36:25.080 --> 36:28.940
it around a bunch no no no they hinted at it you said on the show it's gonna be in november

36:28.940 --> 36:33.080
like a couple that's what I'm saying that they said and that's compared to what they've

36:33.080 --> 36:38.240
released in the past but apparently no it was they were saying there was some comment

36:38.240 --> 36:42.520
that they made it was either an interview or something where they're like yeah there

36:42.520 --> 36:48.480
was a 12.7 percent chance of blah blah blah blah blah and you know it was kind of a little

36:48.480 --> 36:53.400
hint that they threw out that no one caught until just now like I'm saying they could

36:53.400 --> 36:58.240
put this game out on christmas eve and people would still be lining up to get it I mean

36:58.240 --> 37:03.640
it just doesn't matter it's it's that kind of game same thing with diablo 3 if they want

37:03.640 --> 37:10.280
to release diablo 3 on thanksgiving they could do it uh let's see uh looking at comments

37:10.280 --> 37:14.480
from chat dot orange entre.com toy gak in our chat room says I hate digital distribution

37:14.480 --> 37:20.880
hard media forever maybe physical media I don't know I would you I know neither of you

37:20.880 --> 37:24.960
really play well but let's say this was an expansion to a game you do really like let's

37:24.960 --> 37:30.400
say dark soccer was a star trek online second edition or something and I don't know for

37:30.400 --> 37:36.720
loki grand theft auto 5 would you bypass the store completely in favor of digital distribution

37:36.720 --> 37:42.240
no and why not is that just because of what you do for a living uh what I do for a living

37:42.240 --> 37:49.100
and what I do for a hobby okay dark soccer well keep keep in mind I actually did get

37:49.100 --> 37:55.960
both digital and a you're cutting out I got both a digital and the physical copy so that

37:55.960 --> 38:01.740
I could get special content although I have been known in the past to go the digital route

38:01.740 --> 38:06.760
to get it slightly early all right all right and buy a physical copy later on convenience

38:06.760 --> 38:12.040
like when I couldn't find all my wow stuff I downloaded it when I would try to play again

38:12.040 --> 38:16.960
uh boshka in our chat room says collector's edition is barely worth it 40 for a pet no

38:16.960 --> 38:21.920
thanks a lot of collector's editions have a cd and a book and all that I mean but yeah

38:21.920 --> 38:26.160
a lot of collector's editions nowadays to me it seems like they're not worth it anymore

38:26.160 --> 38:30.720
like I used to buy like collector's editions for different things like bioshock and saint's

38:30.720 --> 38:37.600
row 2 and grand theft auto 4 and stuff like that it's just a bunch of crap that they throw

38:37.600 --> 38:43.400
in there I mean I don't need any key I don't need keychains and like metal cases and shit

38:43.400 --> 38:49.640
for my stuff anymore now a cool statue maybe but um you know a lot of times it's not really

38:49.640 --> 38:53.720
worth it although the little big planet 2 collector's edition looks pretty fucking awesome

38:53.720 --> 38:59.240
um tron not so much frisbee in our chat says but does it come with a plate and a spoon

38:59.240 --> 39:04.160
kind of in a reference to that dreamcast game the dark soccer has uh defective candy in

39:04.160 --> 39:08.820
our term says my biggest issue with digital distro is if something happens to my computer

39:08.820 --> 39:12.120
if I can re-download it I would do digital you know that's something that blizzard's

39:12.120 --> 39:16.360
pretty good about though I mean even if you have these games from way before there was

39:16.360 --> 39:20.720
ever digital distribution like for instance I see dan up there in his collection has a

39:20.720 --> 39:25.380
warcraft 3 game and there's a serial number on that if he goes to battle.net and enters

39:25.380 --> 39:29.500
in that serial number it'll get attached to his account and he could always re-download

39:29.500 --> 39:33.080
warcraft 3 wherever he's at so it's kind of you know that is one thing blizzard's pretty

39:33.080 --> 39:36.120
good about is that once you do have the game tied to your account you could always re-download

39:36.120 --> 39:43.680
it anywhere kind of interesting so anyhow one other uh quick note here on world of warcraft

39:43.680 --> 39:49.100
it was also announced by blizzard this week that they have surpassed the 12 million subscriber

39:49.100 --> 39:53.600
mark that's right there are now 12 million subscribers for world of warcraft keep in

39:53.600 --> 39:57.960
mind that's not just in the us this is uh partially attributed to the fact that wrath

39:57.960 --> 40:02.840
of the lich king finally came out in mainland china just about a month ago and of course

40:02.840 --> 40:09.080
cataclysm is coming out here soon so everybody's getting ready for that so who knows um yeah

40:09.080 --> 40:13.240
this is interesting though the last time there was a big population increase announcement

40:13.240 --> 40:18.820
was december 2008 when it got to 11 and a half million so a lot of folks at that time

40:18.820 --> 40:23.240
thought oh wow it's topped off it's dying but nope they got up to 12 million this week

40:23.240 --> 40:27.720
but probably not likely to ever get as high as 20 million as some people thought it once

40:27.720 --> 40:33.960
would there's 20 million people living in australia just so you know come on australia

40:33.960 --> 40:41.040
would what's the holdup there you go so uh yeah world of warcraft 12 million people that's

40:41.040 --> 40:45.160
a lot of people playing but that is a worldwide number not just here in the us otherwise that

40:45.160 --> 40:49.600
would be quite astounding uh i think there are still bigger games in china though i do

40:49.600 --> 40:53.960
not think wow is the biggest game in china by far i believe lineage is still the dominating

40:53.960 --> 41:00.640
game over there so weird yeah dark sakura what do you got for us some more stuff oh

41:00.640 --> 41:05.080
i love stuff how about dc universe yay i'm really looking forward to dc universe online

41:05.080 --> 41:14.920
well um you gotta wait no it's been delayed until spring 2010 no wait spring 2010 then

41:14.920 --> 41:26.680
it's already out 11 no which means that uh it's gonna be a while however um the beta

41:26.680 --> 41:35.520
is gonna be available in november that will be um if you pre-order the game then you are

41:35.520 --> 41:41.840
uh guaranteed access to the november 30th beta so you have to have it you have to pre-order

41:41.840 --> 41:47.280
before november 15th to make it into the beta so you can still get the game in november

41:47.280 --> 41:57.000
you just have to pre-order the game to play the test game yes okay because i'm doing their

41:57.000 --> 42:02.640
job right of course not i'm still very excited about dc universe online i'm sad to hear it's

42:02.640 --> 42:07.480
getting delayed but at the same time there was another big mmo that came out very recently

42:07.480 --> 42:12.720
that i said should probably be delayed until 2011 uh boy did they listen boy yeah boy did

42:12.720 --> 42:16.280
they listen uh so you know what if that's what this game has to do to take the time

42:16.280 --> 42:22.040
to get it right then you know what so be it if it's that much better they can always just

42:22.040 --> 42:28.600
patch it later on that's right that's right it doesn't need to be finished patching finish

42:28.600 --> 42:33.580
it's never finished it's an mmo we're always adding stuff i mean fixing things i mean making

42:33.580 --> 42:39.640
it not shitty i mean tiger claw sharing a new sound effect for us uh i guess this is

42:39.640 --> 42:45.160
the the sister to sad trombone to play when we have depressing stories like uh dc universe

42:45.160 --> 42:54.160
online is delayed until spring 2011 oh that's not a new one this is called sad tuba.com

42:54.160 --> 43:00.560
i just thought sad tuba that's just the price is right losing horn the price is light is

43:00.560 --> 43:04.120
i thought it was going to be the sad trombone thing played on the tuba so i thought it would

43:04.120 --> 43:12.520
be whatever that's the craziest dorkiest thing i've ever heard yeah i know i know anyhow

43:12.520 --> 43:18.960
yeah let's move on quickly before i embarrass myself again yes so um this is kind of neat

43:18.960 --> 43:25.800
on live apparently is ditching the monthly charge and they're going free um and apparently

43:25.800 --> 43:29.880
they're also working on well they they talked about this they're working on a mini kind

43:29.880 --> 43:34.880
of streaming console that's supposed to be manufactured soon apparently um the former

43:34.880 --> 43:41.640
night 14.95 per month service i guess which was um through its founding members program

43:41.640 --> 43:50.860
uh they have offered now a year of free service and apparently uh they're also going to be

43:50.860 --> 43:55.160
offering a bunch of free demos and stuff to check out uh you can i think that the free

43:55.160 --> 44:01.880
service is not free forever i think it's just um you know like a trial type thing and um

44:01.880 --> 44:07.240
you can basically create an account with uh no monthly cost no credit card needed for

44:07.240 --> 44:13.000
sign up and uh lots of free stuff to play and then the micro console it's gonna be like

44:13.000 --> 44:18.160
a kind of a streaming box think of like a sling box or something like that with a controller

44:18.160 --> 44:24.280
built in and you basically plug it into a tv i guess almost looks like maybe like a

44:24.280 --> 44:28.960
was an apple tv or something like that yeah they were showing those at e3 it looked kind

44:28.960 --> 44:33.320
of interesting the whole like plug into the tv stuff yeah i was like is this there's a

44:33.320 --> 44:36.800
trick to this there's a computer in the box or something there's a trick i mean it's not

44:36.800 --> 44:41.400
it's worked so far i mean they the apparently the stuff they've been showing is very low

44:41.400 --> 44:46.200
latency so um apparently they got it to work over wi-fi now too like i remember one of

44:46.200 --> 44:51.000
the big drawbacks originally was that it wouldn't work over wi-fi but now it does let's go figure

44:51.000 --> 44:56.240
um well i mean that was certainly a drawback to online was this whole monthly fee like

44:56.240 --> 45:01.600
really you're gonna like pay me a monthly fee to buy games seems a little strange it's

45:01.600 --> 45:05.720
like you're having to join i'd like someone to pay me a monthly fee to buy games no i

45:05.720 --> 45:11.080
thought that the monthly fee was just like to play whatever on their service kind of

45:11.080 --> 45:16.160
no no no you still have to rent the games or buy the games and even when you buy them

45:16.160 --> 45:19.540
it's only guaranteed for three years because you know you're playing on someone else's

45:19.540 --> 45:24.440
computer so if the service ever gets shut down in three years or whatever then it's

45:24.440 --> 45:30.200
it's gone so it's still a little bit iffy but if you're the type that just wants to

45:30.200 --> 45:36.640
rent games or check out the game demos which certainly is useful um then it might be worth

45:36.640 --> 45:41.760
it i still need to sign up and check it out i would like to make you use of the uh game

45:41.760 --> 45:46.140
rental i think it might be kind of yeah the whole uh free demo thing might be kind of

45:46.140 --> 45:51.140
cool because say for example you know you want to play like one of the new games that's

45:51.140 --> 45:55.680
coming out recently or very soon or something like that and they have a demo for it you

45:55.680 --> 46:00.260
don't want to spend time downloading i mean because some of these demos out there are

46:00.260 --> 46:05.020
you know a few gigs in the download that it might take a very long time and then you have

46:05.020 --> 46:09.980
to install it and that takes more time this you can just play it and go oh don't like

46:09.980 --> 46:17.220
it go to the next one the no need to download install you know worry about doing all that

46:17.220 --> 46:22.960
stuff just kind of play it as you go yeah and plus you could have like a crappy computer

46:22.960 --> 46:27.740
and it still plays and that would be kind of cool to do with like say like an xbox 360

46:27.740 --> 46:32.380
or something like that so i don't have to download the demo i can just boom play the

46:32.380 --> 46:36.560
demo instantly i bet that i bet that's going to be a big feature in the next generation

46:36.560 --> 46:43.940
of consoles maybe i've said i said a while ago that this is the games analyst in me one

46:43.940 --> 46:47.980
of them probably playstation is going to be ballsy enough to try and go all digital just

46:47.980 --> 46:51.540
cut out the physical media completely look out game stop that works so well for them

46:51.540 --> 46:59.260
in the past i think it'll be different because it'll be that the problem with the psp go

46:59.260 --> 47:03.800
is that it was really more lucky more well because it was more money for the removal

47:03.800 --> 47:07.900
of the future but if they had charged like ninety nine dollars for that thing it would

47:07.900 --> 47:16.540
have done great that's the difference so with the psp2 being announced next year i'm sure

47:16.540 --> 47:23.940
we'll see what's coming well we will one thing we know is coming very soon is nba jam and

47:23.940 --> 47:27.760
apparently uh lots of interesting stuff going on with nba jam i don't know if this was covered

47:27.760 --> 47:31.180
last week or if it was this week or what but nba jam i guess got ended up getting split

47:31.180 --> 47:37.420
off from the nba game on the 360 and the ps3 right yeah so now it's coming out as a standalone

47:37.420 --> 47:42.500
game so that's kind of interesting and one thing uh we wanted to see an nba jam uh would

47:42.500 --> 47:46.620
be hidden characters because you know the old school nba jam was awesome because it

47:46.620 --> 47:51.260
had what it had like uh scorpion and some of the mortal kombat characters and what i

47:51.260 --> 47:54.820
think bill clinton was in there somewhere right oh yeah well uh apparently this new

47:54.820 --> 48:01.420
nba jam is is keeping with the political ha ha's and uh you can actually unlock obama

48:01.420 --> 48:07.420
and uh sarah palin as playable characters so yeah uh there are it's out on the we now

48:07.420 --> 48:11.500
so you can check it out and there's actually some codes have already been found on how

48:11.500 --> 48:20.240
to unlock um certain things i guess you can get some furries and everything wow yeah i'm

48:20.240 --> 48:22.920
trying to look at some of the things you can unlock here yeah it looks like you can unlock

48:22.920 --> 48:29.500
some of the mascots there oh yeah they have the mascots available in the old ones a furry

48:29.500 --> 48:35.820
dream you can have bush and chaney on your team why if because you want them to play

48:35.820 --> 48:41.460
basketball bush has mad hoop skills of course there you go so i'm trying to look up some

48:41.460 --> 48:47.400
of these codes where are they ah there we go you can unlock the beastie boys as a team

48:47.400 --> 48:53.540
yeah it sounds like wow there's actually a lot of hidden people in this that's kind of

48:53.540 --> 49:01.680
cool manute bowl is hidden in there good times um i was gonna say i don't know if you heard

49:01.680 --> 49:08.720
about how close nba elite was to being released i mean to the point where an actual retail

49:08.720 --> 49:14.560
copy of it leaked out like a disc because i guess they sent them to retailers and then

49:14.560 --> 49:20.180
the retailers had to send them back oh wow and apparently according to the person that

49:20.180 --> 49:25.080
bought one of the retail copies off ebay um the game was really buggy and really fucking

49:25.080 --> 49:31.700
terrible like just all sorts of glitches and bad stuff in there um and then of course they

49:31.700 --> 49:39.620
had nba jam on the ps3 with that um and apparently that was they have i guess some of the features

49:39.620 --> 49:44.180
that they're talking about adding in now we're actually going to be download content in there

49:44.180 --> 49:48.100
so they're saying oh yeah it's not done yet we're adding remix mode or whatever to the

49:48.100 --> 49:54.140
game well actually we're going to release it anyways you just um now you're not spending

49:54.140 --> 49:59.380
extra money for it or something uh tiger cloth sent me a link in our chat room at chat.org.com

49:59.380 --> 50:03.340
and i remember seeing this early this week and kind of like rolling my eyes it's one

50:03.340 --> 50:10.540
of these stories about um uh when people who don't play games talk about games oh yeah

50:10.540 --> 50:16.540
did you hear about this this is on fox news game on sarah palin facing off against president

50:16.540 --> 50:23.260
obama in basketball not on some court in washington or wasilla it's the new nintendo we version

50:23.260 --> 50:27.980
of the video game nba jam and i apologize this is quiet head-to-head competition shooting

50:27.980 --> 50:33.960
hoops along with a host of high profile politicians peter moore is president anyway they go on

50:33.960 --> 50:38.540
to wonder if uh they're gonna make a bipartisan game and all this i'm just like really come

50:38.540 --> 50:43.860
on anyhow they're pissed off because obama had some sort of super move and the rest didn't

50:43.860 --> 50:51.260
so that's unfair they're biasing you know well he's the president and the rest aren't

50:51.260 --> 50:58.660
i mean it's really quite that simple right in theory right uh anyhow rob what how about

50:58.660 --> 51:03.300
something a little different how about something a little different more about the we well

51:03.300 --> 51:09.820
we just had a story on the way but this is about capcom oh okay um there's going to be

51:09.820 --> 51:15.260
some more um downloads coming up for virtual console of course this is uh particularly

51:15.260 --> 51:25.820
um for the uh uk release um there is going to be um ghouls sorry ghosts and goblins which

51:25.820 --> 51:33.280
we love in this house and 1942 will be available also um black dragon which is a little obscure

51:33.280 --> 51:40.860
um they're also going uh they said they don't have a date yet on them but they're going

51:40.860 --> 51:47.200
to be 800 points apiece and also other uh ones that uh were recently announced were

51:47.200 --> 51:56.160
commando sonson and xx so x texas xx where's quiz and dragons i've been i've been asking

51:56.160 --> 52:02.540
since the top of the show where's my quiz and dragons is that on the list no alas no

52:02.540 --> 52:06.100
rob it is not on the list i like though that a lot of those games you're mentioning are

52:06.100 --> 52:09.500
kind of like the ones outside the box like they're not like all the mainstream arcade

52:09.500 --> 52:14.300
games i mean maybe like ghosts and goblins commando awesome but like you know sun sun

52:14.300 --> 52:18.780
like what's next hiji maru remember that one hija maru hija maru that's it the the one

52:18.780 --> 52:22.340
that's on the pirate ship i don't even think it came out in the us but it's an ultra kade

52:22.340 --> 52:28.700
that's the only way i ever played it pingo pingo was a sega game wasn't it sega i was

52:28.700 --> 52:34.460
just thinking of more obscurity there you go i like this but the there's a little bit

52:34.460 --> 52:38.100
of delay between when we talk and when the chat room gets it so the chat room is commenting

52:38.100 --> 52:44.100
on the whole fox news thing chat.orangecountry.com this is a good joke uh hits they're talking

52:44.100 --> 52:47.700
about how you know obama gets the special move the republicans have nothing hits done

52:47.700 --> 52:54.780
goes but all the republicans have an eight and steal get it it's a political joke come

52:54.780 --> 52:59.180
on come on come on no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on that's that's

52:59.180 --> 53:05.260
kind of funny i want abraham lincoln to be in nba jam i think they should do an all presidential

53:05.260 --> 53:10.860
one that'd be awesome and why leave it to just us presidents why not why not do some

53:10.860 --> 53:16.940
royalty as well that's right get margaret thatcher and queen elizabeth lady gaga while

53:16.940 --> 53:20.900
we're at it should definitely be on a team i'm really surprised so with nba jam being

53:20.900 --> 53:25.180
the way that it is you know where it's just you know static headshots and stuff like that

53:25.180 --> 53:29.180
they didn't have a way to put yourself in the game i mean because all it really is it's

53:29.180 --> 53:34.900
just your you know it's just 2d headshots because that will be nba jam people will have

53:34.900 --> 53:41.140
like middle fingers up for haters man well you don't have to you don't have to have that

53:41.140 --> 53:44.260
available online you can have that where you can just you know if you want to play that

53:44.260 --> 53:49.740
yourself like my me characters those you know we have what upside down head we have you

53:49.740 --> 53:55.820
know vagina person you know it's just ridiculous stuff penis face you know that's on it you

53:55.820 --> 54:00.540
know they're walking through the meat parade no it's great because we were playing uh not

54:00.540 --> 54:04.180
necessarily i don't really know if i have the penis one anymore but we were playing

54:04.180 --> 54:11.060
uh mario kart wii one day and there my boss was watching and he's like did i just see

54:11.060 --> 54:19.220
hitler in the background like yeah nice you might have and chuck norris well uh we have

54:19.220 --> 54:21.980
a list list coming up i don't think we're gonna end up doing it tonight i think we'll

54:21.980 --> 54:24.780
roll it over to next week when we actually have a special guest here but we're actually

54:24.780 --> 54:30.100
gonna do a list list on character i most want to see in nba jam so you can look forward

54:30.100 --> 54:33.380
to that we'll probably end up doing that next week i think we're gonna table that to next

54:33.380 --> 54:36.300
week because we didn't end up having a fourth person here tonight we are gonna have a guest

54:36.300 --> 54:39.540
next week i'll talk more about that a little later on in the show because it's it's very

54:39.540 --> 54:43.780
exciting for very exciting reasons it's gonna be retro-tastic next week and i'll tell you

54:43.780 --> 54:47.940
why exciting guest is exciting a little later on in the show uh in the meantime let's go

54:47.940 --> 54:52.060
and travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming soon to a store near

54:52.060 --> 54:59.160

55:26.520 --> 55:32.540
special edition now with a plastic briefcase that you can hold your nintendo ds in that's

55:32.540 --> 55:38.820
of course on the ds sled shred featuring the jamaican bobsled team wow that would have

55:38.820 --> 55:43.900
been good like years ago um that's coming out wasn't john candy in the cool runnings

55:43.900 --> 55:48.540
movie that was about the jamaican bob yeah that's how old that is that shows you how

55:48.540 --> 55:54.700
old it was because he died what like 15 years ago god rest his soul he was an awesome comedian

55:54.700 --> 56:01.620
but this is a terrible game and it's on the we um other fun stuff let's see disney sing

56:01.620 --> 56:12.500

just on the ds vampire moon the mystery of the hidden sun it's another adventure game

56:17.660 --> 56:23.740
on nintendo ds um you know frisbee in our chair room that's a damn good question is

56:23.740 --> 56:27.500
deal or no deal still on i don't think it is like the syndicated one got canned this

56:27.500 --> 56:31.700
year didn't it i don't know you know what's coming back though because i read game show

56:31.700 --> 56:37.180
blogs one versus i think dylan or deal is still on there because now they're doing the

56:37.180 --> 56:41.540
stupid thing where it's like the actual contestants are opening the cases i couldn't afford to

56:41.540 --> 56:44.080
pay the models anymore that was that that was the syndicated one i don't think that's

56:44.080 --> 56:46.980
on the air anymore i think that went off the air to make room for the this year's batch

56:46.980 --> 56:51.900
of you know judge shows and all that but no i will say one versus 100 is officially coming

56:51.900 --> 56:55.980
back to game show network and it has a new host it's not going to be bob saget you're

56:55.980 --> 57:01.780
ready for this look who's guess who's hosting one versus 100 now arsenio hall tested for

57:01.780 --> 57:06.860

and anaba from dancing with the stars oh huh yeah exactly dude she's she's the girl on

57:42.820 --> 57:46.100

57:46.100 --> 57:50.900
to if you want to get one place bob saget you know who you need you need the pick what

57:50.900 --> 57:55.820

58:04.940 --> 58:10.780
i mean shit well that's like you know maybe four hours at the most it's crazy pants to

58:10.780 --> 58:14.860
me though that the one versus 100 is like gone from xbox live so they can do this cheap

58:14.860 --> 58:18.580
version on game show network with carrie and anaba you know what i mean no disrespect i'm

58:18.580 --> 58:22.140
sure it'll be fine and it's gonna be you know for an original game show it'll be fine did

58:22.140 --> 58:26.980
you know this is still sad totally random but it makes no sense because i i actually

58:26.980 --> 58:33.580
saw this on um it was on the soup i think punked is coming back and they're having justin

58:33.580 --> 58:38.980
bieber hosting it no that is a lie that has to be a lie i don't believe that that has

58:38.980 --> 58:46.860
as much truth as the lapd buying all the jet packs that's how true that story is come on

58:46.860 --> 58:54.140
no way justin bieber is too busy like he's making 15 year old girls panties wet all across

58:54.140 --> 58:59.060
internationally that's that's his job he doesn't have time to do and seriously they have like

59:03.420 --> 59:14.220

amazing i'm gonna i'm gonna wait for the price drop the inevitable price drop that will happen

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:07.340
on this game um i think the original game has already dropped in price no but i can

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.100
get the one with all the uber content yeah right isn't there like a zombie expansion

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.220

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:03.340

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:06.900
for a second i thought they were selling invisibles by itself i'm like what would you do with

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.980
have a panty and stalking game okay that's all i'm saying that's something alan turned

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.180
me on to this week panty and stalking look it up on youtube it's epic music rob need

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.740
more cosplay do we need the music i'll get the music hold on i'll get the music can you

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:17.680
explain what panty and stalking is real quick while i get the music it's an anime by gynax

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:24.340
and the same guys that did powerpuff girls z which was the sort of more teenage version

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:28.060
of powerpuff girls they did in japan okay she needs to get to the good stuff okay chick

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:32.140
kicks off her panties and turns them into a gun okay it's about two angels kicked out

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:50.220
of heaven one for having too much sex it sounds very luminous like this could totally be in

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:57.140
luminous but the whole series isn't animated like this though yeah most of it looks like

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.420
the powerpuff girls but yeah it's just she's up on the stripper pole and then it's very

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.500
seductive like you think the camera is going to go up her vag the way things are looking

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:09.740
there but then she kicks off her panties and they turn into a gun and the other one pulls

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:14.420
off her stocking and it turns into a katana and they destroy the shit monster i'm not

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:23.620
making this up so they need to make a game out of this i've decided that's the regular

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:33.340
was there anything else to say about this she shoots the shit monster in the face i'm

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.740
just digging the soundtrack though because that totally reminds me of you like something

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:41.180
like imagine if they did like a newer space channel five don't make cute games of course

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.540
because that'd be awesome um you know with that type of music you know more of like the

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:52.140
you know luminous type stuff i dug the kind of the swing music for space channel five

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.300
i dig it too but like you know i want something a little cross between like uh res children

01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:01.020
of eden with you know like space less of the psychedelic stuff but you know still that

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:06.140
kind of high energy type of game because i i don't know if a lot of people get into the

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:11.500
swing stuff although i you know i i totally dig the old soundtrack but i could see something

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.920
like that you know just really off the wall sadly i don't think it'll have that same theme

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:25.140
just you know oh yeah it's a little inappropriate for inappropriate as rude americans that don't

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.620
understand the finer things in life it really isn't that far away from bayonetta i'm just

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:34.160
saying it's not like that no that's a game i need to go back and finish honestly when

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.180
alan first explained that to me i was like is this a sequel to bayonetta like what is

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:44.940
this bayonetta is so awesome all right uh dark soccer uk releases sorry uk releases

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:50.180

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:25.040
um ultimate ninja storm 2 that's it and that's what i have to say about naruto games of which

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:31.580
there are always plenty all right it wins a poopy all right uh loki what do you got

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.100
for us and giving ultimate ninja 2 is actually really awesome um i don't know if you've seen

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.580
it looks like a interactive anime i've played a bunch of the earlier naruto games yeah they

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:45.980
were they're fun games there's just too many of them but this is nothing like the early

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:51.140
naruto games this is like the one that came out on ps3 last year um that was just it looks

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:55.860
gorgeous i mean i'm not even in the naruto at all but i mean i almost thought about picking

01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:01.500
up the game just because it looks so amazing um but yeah this new one's gonna be really

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:06.500
awesome especially if you're not a fan uh okay so other stuff that's not naruto related

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:13.520
of course um this is kind of odd to be hearing a first party company say but apparently nintendo

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.780
is saying hey you know what you can't blame piracy for uh poor game sales or at least

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:25.180
they're saying you can't blame piracy completely for poor game sales um they say i don't think

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:31.820
um we should attribute bad software sales solely to piracy um they're talking a little

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.780
bit about you know this was i guess during a q and a session i guess last week during

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:40.220
when they were talking about the 3ds pricing and stuff like that it's true there is always

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:45.900
an influence of piracy but it's important for us to increase the number of our consumers

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:50.120
who are willing to shell out their money to purchase our products so we do not intend

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.580
to think that slower sales are solely due to piracy and i kind of agree with them because

01:13:54.580 --> 01:14:01.300
a lot of people out there you know people that pirate games aren't necessarily people

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:07.580
that buy games so if you lose a sale to someone pirating a game doesn't mean you're actually

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:13.120
going to lose a sale you know a physical copy sale because they were never going to purchase

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.260
a copy of the game in the first place dark toa gak in our chat room is saying nintendo

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:23.700
saying that bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit um but it was the wata that

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:28.940
said that so what it was a magazine interview i'm sorry it wasn't a magazine interview it

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:33.060
was during i guess a live interview during their nintendo conference thing when they're

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:40.300
uh talking about like the 3ds pricing and stuff like that oh right okay so um well i

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:44.020
mean you're you're kind of right in that regard that i think the people who pirate games aren't

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.300
usually the ones who are going to run to the store and buy them anyway the thing i do like

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:52.060
i i do kind of see as a problem not that it excuses them no it doesn't excuse them but

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:56.420
i think you know for example like on the wii and stuff a lot of the games that are more

01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:02.180
niche or adult and stuff don't seem to do as well as say some of the games that most

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:07.580
people would be like why is that selling so much it's just a shitty ass party game but

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:13.940
people buy that stuff just like just dance a game that when it first came out like this

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:17.500
is stupid and then it's just at the top of the charts and you play it and you're like

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:21.520
wow this is actually kind of fun i had people come up to me at work who knew i had a video

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.700
game addiction and asked me if i've ever played it because they had and they had so much fun

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:29.860
with it and i'm thinking like really it's weird it the thing about just dance though

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:34.260
and it's kind of funny is you know that michael jackson the experience it's pretty much the

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:39.500
same game but that has also karaoke in there as well if you want to otherwise it's just

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:44.520
dance michael jackson that's basically what that is but it's probably part of the agreement

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.080
with the michael jackson camp or whatever you call it that they can't put michael jackson's

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.180
name below the title of the game like like probably like when beatles rock band came

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.980
out there's no way they were gonna call that game rock band beatles it was always the beatles

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:03.040
rock band yeah you know what i mean uh the same thing well it's not just dancing either

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.820
so yeah that would make sense just singing and dancing oh fair enough oh plus actually

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:13.640
just dance doesn't exist on the connect and the move yet but these michael jackson games

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.460
coming out on all of them right yes it is coming out all of them i mean it's basically

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:22.200
going to be like what dance central is except dance central and what i like about dance

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.200
central a little bit more than say um just dance is dance central first off can read

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:31.880
your whole body it's not just reading the sensor so you know for example if you're if

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:36.720
you want to play just dance and kind of cheat at it you just do what they're doing with

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.640
the one you know with your one hand holding your remote your right hand you just do what

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.720
they're doing on the screen you don't have to really do the rest of it um but this actually

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.520
reads everything you're doing and also like you know just like you would do with actual

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.600
street dancing or something it actually breaks down everything so you can go okay this is

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.240
this step this is how you do this step you learn that and then you just chain them together

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:06.680
to create a routine that's how you would learn to do actual dance routines um so i think

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:13.040
that's kind of neat there but uh yeah i mean it it's games like that that kind of appeal

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.560
to the mass audience that seem to do well and then on the we are and on the wheel on

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.800
the ds poor sales i mean a lot of that can be attributed to the games themselves because

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:28.240
there's a lot of junk on the ds a lot of junk and um unfortunately a lot of good games out

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.880
there just kind of get ignored because of all the junk that's out there because you

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.600
know people you know mass consumers don't really know a lot about games um a lot of

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.960
times in fact i was in a game stop today killing time for my double bacon pizza to be done

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:50.080
and um other than the employees bugging me about wanting to buy something i'm like no

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.440
hey man did you want to pre-order your copy oh hey that's a cool t-shirt i love that game

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.960
i'm like yeah that's cool hey you look like a man on the mission um is there anything

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.560
i can help you find no i'm just looking around killing time for my pizza oh that's a good

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:08.800
idea yeah i thought so too yeah that's why i'm here because i thought sitting around

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.520
the pizza place sucks no but um there was a kid walking around he's like is far cry

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:21.040
predator a good game and it's just like well that came out a while ago and besides you're

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.720
like 10 you shouldn't be playing a mature rated game because your parents don't care

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.760
you know but when we were young oh god here we go when we were young and playing those

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.780
8-bit you know nintendo games there was a lot of crap that we liked that i bet a lot

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.320
of people kind of looked at went boy this this is not a good thing that a lot of the

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:44.200
focus though was about games being fun see now and and now i i get it that there there's

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:50.600
a lot of that stuff out there now that it's it i mean back in our day there was also educational

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.520
games and stuff like that too but we were smart enough to know okay that's an educational

01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:00.240
game i'm not touching that shit you know unless it was oregon trail or number munchers hey

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.640
well that stuff was force fed onto us you know at an early age and you know we just

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.680
adapted to it but i'm saying like you know with there's a lot of educational product

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.440
out there on the ds there's a lot of crappy licensed games well there's a lot of crappy

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:19.360
licensed game even on the nyes although cool spot was awesome and yo annoyed wasn't that

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.300
bad so they could pull it off back then it's just now unfortunately it's all about the

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:30.820
license and not about the gameplay as you know they have the jelly belly puzzle game

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:37.040
and the still waiting for my kill bill video game that's all i'm saying never gonna happen

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.760
well maybe when they do the third movie which that's never gonna happen you never know you

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.720
never know all right right you know what and i'll come out right after the clerk's animated

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:51.560
movie all right moving on to a game that is coming out like it or not in loki's case i

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:10.600
on there way to go bob purchasing two copies of the game you're an idiot i wonder though

if the uh you know they say the special placement in one very cool spot for buying three versions

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:20.440
i wonder if that's like in the credits of sonic part two sonic four part two that's

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:28.320
probably what it is that's still dumb don't you want your name in a video game it should

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:35.560
reward you with episode two instead of just you know oh so like incentives so by who the

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.680
main character of episode two is gonna be oh are you gonna spoil it for all our listeners

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.240
um i don't even know what the character's name is because once again i i don't follow

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:50.200
sonic way it's a stupid sonic robot thing not metal sonic but it's the one with he has

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.920
a spiky nose that's my that's my wonderful description of the sonic character frisbee

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:02.600
in our chat room says if you want your name in a thread just post in that thread that's

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:07.200
a good idea i'm gonna start no i'm not gonna do that because that would require effort

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.840
i was gonna say someone should start a thread on that same form of people who put their

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.560
names in who haven't bought any copies of it uh defective candy in our chat room says

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.280
maybe you guys could say hey give me five bucks and we'll stick your name to the top

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:26.440
of the olr forums i i'd love to but i i don't know that just seems really wrong to me it's

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.560
just really wrong uh act deft in our chat says loki sky and jamie need to buy one each

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:37.400
and get olr mentioned though no i'm not buying a copy of that you can buy three and get olr

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:44.880
mentioned exactly i would like to submit a fake fake name like you know bonnie von fluffles

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.740
or something like that you know like submit fake names that would be funny to get this

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:55.760
community manager to say sassy pants fuzzy bottom exactly i love that idea and big shout

01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:04.800
out to sassy pants fuzzy bottom good times let's take a look in gaming's history and

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.360
the way things used to be in a better time it's a classic game of the week it's the part

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:16.520
of our show where dark sakura goes into the vault and says hey i'm gonna find a game that

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.560
these kids should be playing dark sakura what is the classic game of the week for these

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:31.320
little brats who don't know better the classic game is final fantasy 5 yay yay i picked boss

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.400
music because i couldn't find anything else um yeah it's a game by square came out in

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:44.040
1992 um it was only out in japan for the longest time on the super famicom and um it's super

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:54.480
fun it's the uh stars a guy named farts who actually the longest time it was but which

01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:03.480
i used to laugh um a meteor falls and he goes to check it out and then oh noes we need the

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:10.520
crystals we have to uh seal x death which is the coolest name for a bad guy in a series

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:18.480
ever x death would you be afraid i might be afraid of x death anyway the cool thing about

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:26.980
this game is the job system um you your experience point and you battle monsters and stuff like

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:33.760
any final fantasy game you can get a chocobo and you get a ship and an airship and you

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.200
do different stuff this is the second one that uses the act of time battle where time

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.360
will flow continuously for both players and enemies which was first and final fantasy

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:51.400
4 which was 2 when it came out over here um the job system though is a really cool thing

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:58.800
because um you can gain different special abilities and sort of mix up your jobs um

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.080
you get ability points so you increase the job levels for different characters and you

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:12.680
can also say uh so you have a knight who also has white magic levels well then you become

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:18.600
a paladin for an example um you this is also the game that introduced the blue mage the

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:25.840
time age and the mind so that's why we have them in other final fantasy games um it was

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:33.440
a really cool game it had lots of cool characters you have uh lenna barks faris kriel they're

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:40.320
really cool um also a reoccurring boss which is what this music is is gilgamesh always

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.960
gilgamesh lots of gilgamesh battles um so yeah it's a pretty cool game um if you haven't

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.480
played it yet for the longest time you can only play it you know if you either had the

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.640
cartridge or had a really good emulator free japanese or it was translated um so it's really

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:06.680
cool um it was also one of and your microphone failed at this game what you can hear me now

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:13.640
i can okay well as i was saying it's one of the ones that was uh directed by sakaguchi

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:20.480
sorry and this is his favorite final fantasy game um all the character designs logo everything

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:28.400
was done by um Amano Yoshitaka Amano who is my hero and um the battle graphics are done

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:38.400
by Nomura that's pretty cool and um there had great music it's it's final fantasy it

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:44.660
was done by Uematsu there's a two disc album that came out with all the tracks on it which

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:50.440
i've got somewhere and then it also had a bunch of uh remixes there was a piano collection

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:58.160
final fantasy 5 and the remixes including final fantasy 5 mambo de chocobo we have since

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:06.240
seen it elsewhere um it's come out um on the playstation in japan um there was a final

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.520
fantasy collection that came out over here that had final fantasy 4 and final fantasy

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:17.880
6 on it it had a full motion video opening very cool and then we had the final fan the

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:29.880
final fantasy anthology um also on the playstation and uh they uh that's why they uh cheat where

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:44.000
they change the name to uh art and gill instead of guido um there was a playstation 2 release

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:55.480
there was a gameboy advance release that had uh an extra level and a new boss and they

01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:04.360
were uh designed by Amano and then there was final fantasy 5 advance and uh it was really

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.200
cool there was however an automated it was called final fantasy legend of the crystals

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:16.440
that was an oav that was done by studio madhouse and uh it was the sequel to final fantasy

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:27.080
5 so there you go all right your classic game of the week boys and girls final fantasy 5

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.200

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.880
this on the podcast because sadly we can't put our break music on the podcast because

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:00.720
it's copyright but i had a few tells asking me about one of the songs we played in the

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:05.320
break there um there was a baba yetu from siv 4 because i know a lot of people are crazy

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:09.440
about siv 5 right now and i don't have that soundtrack but i have a siv 4 which by the

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.560
way if you went to video games live that's one of the songs they did at video games live

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.800
and it's it's such an epic great song i can play clips we can't get away with playing

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.440
clips let me play a quick clip quick clip

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:33.320
so you just hear the epic epicness in it it's like the music on the title screen which is

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.840
so yeah i love the civilization series what can i say i have yet to check out five though

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.320
it's all part of that whole like i spent all my money on disneyland this month so i haven't

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:44.280
purchased a lot of games but that's that's one of the ones i've got to look into getting

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:51.520
for sure so we'll see um by the way things going on this week guess guess what um is

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:55.480

day for me it is october 13th anyone anyone it is my you all right i was gonna answer

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.100
yeah because you know i told you before the show all right it's my 10-year anniversary

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.320
of playing ddr that's right 10 years ago on october the 13th was the first day i ever

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.480
played ddr which you know might not seem like a big deal to all of you because like you

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:19.060
know oh hey dancing arrow stomping game funny but um you know if it weren't for ddr this

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:23.360
show wouldn't exist i probably would not know jamie or matt if it weren't for ddr we probably

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.100

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:35.520
lose a lot of weight during those 10 years playing ddr um no not now i wish i was playing

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.840
as much ddr as i was back then yeah that would help at the time heck yeah i was at my skinniest

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.920
when i first started playing ddr i mean that was around the time i think that was the same

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:50.360
time i was like dating a vegan who loved to cook and so like the worst food you ever eat

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.680
dating dating a vegan who loves to cook like you i will eat anything a vegan puts in front

01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:00.240
of me because you know the worst thing that's in it is a vegetable or soy like it's terrible

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.880
it's not going to be like surprise cow brains or surprise it's the uterus of a duck you

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.360
know or something like that you know what i mean hey dan's had a cow brain i never heard

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:16.280
you complaining when i stuffed cow brains in the uterus of a duck right okay but i'll

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:20.400
tell you what i was like super thin back then when i was playing ddr and dating a vegan

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:26.360
like man that was that was crazy now i just now i eat at waffle square and and play world

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:32.280
of warcraft so i've gained a significant amount and now i eat double bacon pizzas exactly

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:38.600
which is funny because now i'm mostly vegetarian i know you're the one that's actually lost

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.680
the weight since those days some so you guys need to stop being vegetarian because i have

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:48.180
to eat more meat to compensate okay well yeah i'm not vegetarian i'm just i'm whatever i

01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:55.000
eat meat like once a month all right anyhow i mean you know like cow flesh all right we'll

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.960

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.480
go back to gaming news and all that fun stuff here actually i want to talk more about robin

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:34.800
address no let's not i don't want to give people the wrong impression it's rocky horror

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:41.040
it's different all right uh loki start us off with some rapid fire news please well

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:46.920
during release um our releases this week i mentioned that the gears or not gears of worth

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.600
that'd be funny um borderlands game of the year edition is going to be coming out and

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.280
um well what's kind of neat about it is they just announced that the game of the year edition

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.040
of borderlands and this pisses me off because i bought most of the download content on its

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.820
own um will be coming with not only all the download content for borderlands but early

01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:12.800
access to duke nukem forever in other words the demo so even more incentive to spend 60

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:18.000
dollars on the game most of you already have exactly yeah god i want that demo but you

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.320
know what though me being me um that demo will leak out and i'll be able to download

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:30.000
it so i don't care aren't you special i am special i'm thinking about but i don't know

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.240
how much i'd like borderlands but i hear it's like a first person world of warcraft with

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:39.040
guns borderlands is fun it's it's like yeah it's it's a first person shooter but it's

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:47.360
kind of a little bit of an rpg and there's a lot of like you know i'm looting i guess

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.120
so if you like loot it's a little bit like diablo i guess i like the phase walker girl

01:36:52.120 --> 01:37:02.080
she's pretty cool yes she is pretty awesome i played the uh the hunter with a mordecai

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:08.160
yeah yeah with his raven of death uh that was awesome the the berserker guy is pretty

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:13.040
cool too act definite our chairman says damn it i got borderlands on steam for ten dollars

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:19.680
u.s that's why they put it on sale right before all this these announcements and jessica's

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:24.840
linking more old pictures of me she uh uh linked this one of me dressed up as brad for

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.520
the rocky or picture show and uh ezam in our chat room i hope i said that right he's on

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.560
ezam ezam and her chairman says for a second i thought it was what the buck hey hey watch

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:38.920
oh god did she just link that one yes poke of pokemon knight iraqi horror no i think

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:44.000
it was our final scene or whatever parade that was the game that was my 21st birthday

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.080
that was the pride parade in san francisco that was my 21st birthday or the i think the

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:54.720
day after my doing elbow right around there crazy stuff that was great um all right other

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:59.520
stuff uh dj hero 2 of course is coming out soon in a couple weeks hopefully i'll have

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:06.160
my next week i want it early um anyways they're going to be doing more bundles with the game

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.040
as well if you happen to skip the first game you're in luck especially if you're in europe

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.400
because the dj hero 2 bundles that will be coming out over there will be including a

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.280
free copy of the original game as well which by the way they are selling the original game

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:26.220
uh by itself in case you you know want to build your own bundle over here um in the

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:32.440
u.s. uh for another 50 bucks which is kind of a rip off if you ask me i believe though

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.440
if you pre-order through toys r us which no one's really doing that anymore because toys

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:42.600
r us is almost out of business um that's my only opinion really what makes you say that

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.920
no because i don't shop there anymore well because therefore the chain is out of business

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.000
because you don't shop there anymore the amount of crap i buy yeah i thought it was supposed

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.640
to be a cheap place to get diapers there is no cheap place to get diapers um but i think

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.880
if you pre-ordered there you also get a free copy of the game so it might be something

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:11.400
to keep in mind and then last but not least um with the release of the new mario anniversary

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:19.480
edition which by the way is just mario all stars but on the we now waiting not with extra

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:24.200
mario games no no not with anything not port of the super nintendo straight ass port of

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.200
the nintendo and it's not even the one that comes with mario something that they could

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:32.560
have i don't know put on virtual console for like ten dollars well maybe that's what they'll

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.120
do here in the u.s. because we haven't heard anything about this coming to the u.s. right

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.800
oh it'll come to the u.s. i guarantee it they can charge fifty dollars for something that

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:45.760
was really worth ten yeah they'll bring it out over here um but seriously nintendo we've

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.360
gotten into this conversation about how nintendo doesn't really they they do make new stuff

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.480
now but a lot of the stuff that they put out like hey look new mario game it's not really

01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:01.640
new it's just ports of old games anyways that's not why we're talking about this we're talking

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.940
about this because they have a garish red looking console that's going to be coming

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:11.000
out over there instead to commemorate you know the mario 25th anniversary edition i

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.080
guess you know it doesn't have any cool mario graphics or anything it's just red and that'll

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:23.240
be coming out over there for uh 20 000 yen dark tetsuya in our chat room says great now

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.760
you're making me feel awful because i want this so bad you are an awful person if you

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:31.960
want this so bad stop it didn't even change the color of the light in the front you change

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:36.720
that to like red or something you know it's a collector's thing i don't know it's stupid

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.840
i think it should have a mario graphic on it yeah they should put some of these silkscream

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:52.800
some fucking shit on there we want stickers pimp my wee all right so loki will not be

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:58.320
pre-ordering one of these no why would i want yeah let me import a console from japan even

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.080
though i have a we already that i don't play anything on and then you know oh it's in a

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:08.680
wonderful red color that i really don't like that's awesome totally gonna put down four

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:16.040
i want tons of them all right some quick stories from me for you guys gears of war 3 uh is

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:19.000
gonna of course have multiplayer just like the other ones did there's gonna be a beta

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.400
of the multiplayer uh and epic games actually revealed this at an event this week um at

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.840
their headquarters uh this is the first time though that a gears war game is getting a

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.200
public beta so that's kind of cool uh gears war 3 is going to be coming out in the fall

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:37.480
of 2011 so the beta will be out sometime in the spring maybe they haven't said exactly

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.120
when next year they've just said next year there will be a beta so you guys can completely

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.840
base your judgments of the game off of beta because it's what a lot of people do a little

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:52.220
big planet too also delayed until next year maybe not as late next year i think i'm hearing

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:57.800
it's just going to be january probably they are not going to um actually release it this

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.560
year in time for the holidays and the reason why they don't want launch day passes patches

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:07.360
patches as i say passes patches uh quote we could have shipped it and it would have been

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.680
fine and this is a quote from the head of media molecule alex avens however we realize

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.900
that with just a couple extra weeks we can make the game super amazing adding the super

01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.560
onto the already amazing which is this today this is something that will live forever and

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.880
the delay people will forget about i kind of like that he says that because that's a

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.820
that's a point we've brought up on the show before people don't forget oftentimes that

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.240
these games were delayed if they were that good like for example uh mario brothers melee

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:38.920
super or super mario brothers super smash brothers melee or whatever the one on the

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.700
we i was delayed like five times and people kind of just forgot by the time the game actually

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:50.280
came out you know what though i'm saying this is a good thing this is a good deal if it

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:55.360
keeps the game in good quality just like some of these other delays we've been hearing about

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.080
it's very interesting though that always at the end of the year delay delay delay it's

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.360
great that they're putting it out and so that we don't have any day one patches because

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.080
you know those people that don't have their playstations connected to the playstation

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:12.440
network anymore because of usb devices that they're using with their playstation 3 and

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.920
one more for me uh this is about a new shen moo game that's right there is that's right

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:26.880
there is a new shen moo game coming out it's coming out in japan this year shen moo town

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:34.640
is coming out on yahoo japan it's a mobile based social network mobage town that's right

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:40.720
the new shen moo game is a mobile game it's the third shen moo game there you go but they're

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:45.680
not calling it shen moo 3 but it's very i i don't know i still say this is a good sign

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.900
though if they're wanting to keep this fresh in people's minds this might be a good sign

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:55.480
so don't get too frumpy dark sakura no frumping over there but sorry it's not the game you

01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:01.000
were hoping i was going to mention here on the show sad tuba all right dark sakura what

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:08.760
you got for us stuff and things how about um mega man stuff there's going to be a comic

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:15.640
out it's being put out by archie comics and um they are saying it's going to be faithful

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.920
to continuity so hopefully then again they also did that sonic the hedgehog ones that

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:27.160
i didn't think was very good nor the knight's one wasn't good at all um but it is written

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:34.480
by um ian flinn who's currently writing sonic the hedgehog um yeah i don't really have high

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:40.680
hopes for it the art looks interesting i mean protoman looks really freaking cool but i

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:49.720
don't know it might be okay we'll see when it comes out and in other news um typing of

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:58.440
the dead this is going to be a new version yay um it's typing of the dead featuring mina

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:06.960
no shuko i would be help if i could pronounce this properly featuring mina no shoku katsu

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:16.000
doniki um which is pretty much the dreamcast version with new words um except these look

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:27.480
like they're it says that everyone's job hunting diary so it's uh a job hunting site in japan

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:33.600
that they've teamed up with interesting so it's like um if they were to make a game on

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:41.880
monsters these are mini games in job hunting modes so you can type in words like disability

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:50.480
income and stagnant air interesting huh it's like these people never get a job they're

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:57.360
just playing games all the time and last but not least is more marvel vs capcom 3 stuff

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:04.600
we have new characters we have sir arthur and nathan spencer um arthur being from uh

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:15.800
ghosts and goblins which we talked about in part a and nathan spencer is uh from the uh

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:27.800
3d one i'm trying to see what this is hold on yeah that sucks i'm happy about arthur

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:33.400
being in it that's pretty cool so uh and we're also supposed to hear more characters later

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:41.000
on so that's pretty neat i i've already heard about people i care about that's it all right

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.080

01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:35.880

oh modok is you ever see the big giant head thing that's just a little harness yeah that's

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:09.880
modok okay but what's what's modok from from um various marvel comics really annoying character

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:25.720
a twitter topics tweets time tweeters oh found it mental organism designed only for killing

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:34.280
twitter.com slash olr if you want that's you in a nutshell says loki all right going to our twitter

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.640
and looking at some of the topics um not a whole lot tonight but we will get through some of these

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:48.680
here um yeah see this first one here from pop on jar or as i like to read his name popo and jar

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:54.040
it's the popo pop on jar estimates us surely you've seen this the most useless game accessory

01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:57.800
ever and it's it's the game boat i remembered seeing that on the twitter and i just love the

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.000
picture because it's like the dude he's on a boat but yeah looks looks completely useless about his

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:09.080
use useless is that inflatable cart that i still kind of want the one that's coming out this week

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:18.680
yes uh mnzba sends us a tweet nintendogs blamed for an actual dog attack how in the hell does

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:25.320
this work yes uh let's see uh according to the daily mail this is in the uk megan walker was

01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:30.040
peacefully playing a copy of nintendogs at a friend's house when one of the in-game dogs

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.400
barked at her but the bark was an earshot of the friend's bull mastiff a breed of dog that weighs

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:42.120
about 130 pounds the sound spooked the dog so much that it bit walker's face severing a portion

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:48.440
of her upper lip how sad the girl's grandma told the daily mail i think this game should carry some

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:53.160
kind of warning people should be told not to play it when there are dogs in the room i blame the

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:57.240
game for what happened to make it will eat your face if they hadn't been playing it i don't think

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.840
the dog would have gone for it you know lady maybe you shouldn't keep 130 pound dog near a

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:08.440
nine-year-old call it a hunch just a thought or one that's prone to eating your dog better just

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.840
thinking if you have a face eating dog you might want to keep it away from your nine-year-old

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:19.320
right i think a bull mastiff is the largest breed of dog good god they're huge crazy lady

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.880
i was bit by a dog when i was five it's not fun you're afraid of dogs i am actually like i i'm

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.280
getting better i used to be afraid of like all dogs but now it's just big dogs like if i was

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.760
around 130 pound dog i'd be running the other way i'm not even gonna lie but now like i'm at the

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:41.880
point where like alan has talked me into getting a corgi some corgis are adorable and they're little

01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:47.960
and they're cute and they waggle and that's adorable they're super cute but i'm mostly a

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:53.560
kitty person uh blue swim is tweeting us namco bandai will be releasing the first sailor moon

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:59.640
game on the nintendo ds by year's end in italy no other details yet it will be the first new

sailor moon game since the series was relaunched internationally early this year so you can get

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:10.680

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:14.920
facebook xbox live and playstation network hopefully it'll get you more listeners you sir

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:20.200

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.040
need to say this not that i'm saying spazinator is doing this but just remember guys don't spam

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:29.400
you don't have to spam people because that just makes us look bad just saying tassel hoff

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:37.560
sends us a tweet hey olr i like it when people spell hey h a y hey hey olr what was a scene

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:43.160
in a video game that made you shed a tear or cry because of the scene oh we were talking about this

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:50.200
on warcraft the other night on vent games that made you cry that they were so sad um i probably

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:55.320
cried like twice during lost odyssey and i didn't even beat the game uh but just the end of the

01:51:55.320 --> 01:52:01.240
first disc especially was very very sad um and i remember um i remember getting a little verklempt

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.080
at final fantasy 4 at the ending of that too most final fantasy games actually get me a little bit

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:10.360
verklempt loki was there ever a game that made you cry no he's saying no well he's sucked into

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.840
some iphone game he doesn't want to talk to you guys right now he's playing iphone games

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:18.920
uh dark sakura game that made you a little a little bit verklempt i've cried out of frustration

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:26.280
okay what game made you cry out of frustration oh a couple at least a few puzzle games and playing a

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.280
x-men versus street fighter with dan because i'd get so pissed off at him that i'd cry

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:40.040
i can admit it nice all right uh moving on to some other tweets uh oh we've been getting this

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:44.840
from a couple people actually akki ripper says it's a tweet but jeweled is free at the moment

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:50.360
at popcap.com that's right that's only for about another what two hours so sadly which i i got it

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.560
too late for the podcast ease but if you're listening to this now you can get bejeweled 2

01:52:53.560 --> 01:53:00.200
free i gotta be honest though i mean how many of you don't already own bejeweled 2 in one way or

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:04.920
another i didn't really you can play it online for free you always could i wasn't interested

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:11.640
but i like the iphone one no i had it on my old ass phone back in the day i have it on the iphone

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:17.320
phone phone and the xbox 360 so i appreciate that they're giving away a free game but it's it's a

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:23.160
10 year old game you guys no but hey free games are free games i just feel like i'm being a digital

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:29.880
hoarder if i download that all right spazinator psn says fyi in homes theater there's an episode

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:34.520
of inuyasha streaming for free oh that's kind of neat that they're using the theater to stream

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:40.040
free like quote unquote real things and not just the in-house sony stuff like the tester

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.800
or whatever that's kind of cool i think they should do more of that in sony home

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:51.720
act def says uh kirby's epic yarn was supposed to be a new ip for nintendo so originally i guess

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.560
this wasn't even going to be a kirby game that's kind of neat he's actually linking us to a story

01:53:55.560 --> 01:54:02.200
here i guess awata made some comments on this um originally let's see and it was revealed that

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:06.920
kirby was not going to be in the game and the original character going by the name of fluff

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:12.440
could have been the main character with the game carrying the title world of yarn instead which is

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.480
funny given the other article that said that it was inspired by a kirby commercial that they did

01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:25.400
in japan in the mid 90s interesting uh let's see tiger claw sends us a couple tweets and i don't

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:28.280
remember either of these being on our show world so i'll go ahead and mention about these stories

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:33.320
real quick again from tiger claw on twitter uh nintendo patent shows the we fidelity sensor game

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:39.960
example so i guess the uh patent leaked out and it kind of shows how this uh thing works let's see

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:46.440
the vitality sensor measures a player's relax fluid sounds kind of gross it's just one of the

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:52.600
examples of the game it's calculated by measuring the cardiac cycle over a hundred pulses similar

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:58.040
to brain age this number can be compared to relax fluid of same age persons it mentions a stretch

01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:02.280
game where players tilt the remote up and down to move a character while you're moving flying

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:08.200
character players have to adjust their breathing to match the ceilings dips and drops interesting

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:13.240
the character automatically moves that the screen scrolls to the right when you inhale you fire

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:18.520
smiling blobs hat up towards the ceiling it drops when you exhale this game uses the vitality sensor

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:24.840
to identify inhales and exhales interesting but again i i don't see how this is gonna like they'll

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:30.360
make a wario aware game out of this and that's it you know what i mean there's always a warrior

01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:35.320
aware game for the peripheral then it'll be done also and i remember reading about this too and

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.200
this is always sad to hear about layoffs but microsoft's in-game ad unit apparently is shutting

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:45.960
down this month and this is a report in an ad industry trade publication ad week citing sources

01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.160
close to the company and insiders of microsoft stating that massive general manager j.j richards

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.760
is now seeking new employment and other unit members have been reassigned throughout the

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:58.360
company so i guess only one person got laid off so i guess that's good that they were able to be

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:03.320
redistributed um microsoft apparently had been shopping around a massive buyout in the past few

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:08.840
months uh what this all boils down to though i guess it's conflicts with the xbox live team

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:14.520
because the xbox live team sells the ads directly on the xbox dashboard and doesn't really want the

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:23.320
competition with the in-game ads so there it goes bye there you go that's our twits tweets twats

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:29.320
for tonight twitter.com thank you guys for your tweets we'll see you next week on the twitter in

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:36.600
the meantime i'm gonna have to go back and uh wake up loki from his iphone awake hi and climber

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:42.280
it's awesome is that like crazy climber no it's like uh if you cross bionic commando with a ninja

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:51.800
and it's all like climbing really fast it's cool and it's free free is awesome free is awesome so

01:56:51.800 --> 01:57:00.600
this is kind of neat apparently uh at&t uh u-verse is going to be offering um ip tv i guess or

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:09.080
streaming tv coming to your xbox 360 and this is coming in november apparently um customers are now

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:16.120
able to use their existing xbox 360 with a hard drive as a u-verse receiver so you will be able to

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:23.080
um i guess stream tv to it it says must have at least one standard receiver or dvr in order for

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:30.040
the xbox as a set top box to work and it says uh new fields will be displayed on the tv receiver

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:35.560
section and blah blah uh xbox connect our connection kit will include a installation

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:45.560
cd remote and dongle and dongle ah yes and so um i guess it's going to be coming very soon and i

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:51.960
guess with the new uh dashboard they'll be coming up probably very soon as well so um that's kind

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:58.680
of neat wish i had att u-verse because uh comcast sucks but um don't have that option right now

01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:07.320
well i guess that's cool i don't know though it seems like with all these like apple TVs and

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.320
netflix and all this other stuff this seems to be a couple years late now you know what i mean like

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:15.000
when we first heard about it in europe it sounded awesome or was it japan that had this first i

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.560
don't remember it sounded awesome but now that we have all this other stuff that delivers tv shows

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:24.920
i mean there's only so many ways you can watch glee over the over the internet's you know what

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:29.560
i mean do we really need this one as well you know oh i forgot you're on the i hate glee bandwagon

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.320
now because the whole beatles no i was on the i hate glee bandwagon before then the show just

01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:41.400
irritates me i i haven't watched it this season so i can't say but i always in my gut thought

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:46.680
that show was going to be like heroes awesome first season not so great which was glee i haven't

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:52.520

01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:03.720
second season was like okay it was yeah there was the the chick that was like maya that was her name

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:11.880
she's like single-handedly ruined the show remember that my emo powers exactly i sucked

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:18.440
life out of you with my emo exactly yeah that was a terrible season and it just went downhill

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.040
release of the new x-men game what about the new x-men movie isn't there a new x-men movie coming

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:45.400
out next year like yeah yeah like it's a it's first class or something it's like a prequel

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:51.880
or whatever yeah you know they recast everybody there was a whole comic series called x-men first

02:02:51.880 --> 02:03:00.200
class okay all the you know new original stories from the early days okay could be interesting i

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:05.960
suppose but it's going to be hard without patrick stewart as professor x i'm just saying all right

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:08.760
uh we're not gonna do list list tonight we're gonna table that to next week so let's move on

02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:17.000
with some more news loki uh yes um so this is kind of cool uh apparently uh mega man legends

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:24.680
is going to be asking people to uh submit ideas for stuff that they want to see in the game um

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:31.000
they're going to be asking the community to actively participate in um different development

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.040
parts uh some of the examples that they had on the one page their boss characters uh voice actors

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:42.280
ideas they want them all and um of course that's why project is in the title they said it would be

02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:48.120
a collaborative experience uh but not in the way mega man universe is instead i guess the community

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:53.080
will be able to actively actively participate in the development of the game uh capcom unity

02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:58.760
website will be updated with a dev room where fans will be able to submit their gameplay ideas boss

02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:04.520
ideas character ideas and more in the future fans will be able to vie for position in the game's

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:11.880
voice cast pizza man do do do do do some of these character designs are really cute the

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:17.480
fan submitted ones yeah they don't look bad i want to be a voice actor in mega man legends

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:22.600
well where do i sign up you just got the sign up with the website bunny girl

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:27.000
i don't want to be a voice actor for bunny girl sorry

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:35.800
but uh yeah it's kind of cool i wonder why all this audience participation in the game is it

02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:40.840
just a gimmick to try and sell more copies or do you think they just really want fresh ideas or

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:46.520
what what do you think's the motivation behind this i'm not sure uh probably just you know more

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:54.200
of the meta stuff because everybody likes being you know able to contribute to a game and having

02:04:54.200 --> 02:05:00.440
their credit and stuff and it's way better than having a name web 2.0 yeah kind of stuff yeah

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:07.960
that makes sense all right uh that way fans can't bitch if the game sucks because you made it made

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:14.440
it well it's all your fault the game get bad got bad reviews all right um i think this is kind of

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:19.160
strange um you know how there's the kindle right and i think dark soccer you you use the kindle

02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.560
i use the kindle app on my phone is that just the same thing as a kindle i don't know well the

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:29.720
kindle itself is the device that amazon sells you know the large one has got internet access and

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:34.280
shit right i just have the app for it on my phone so i can read books oh okay what can't you use

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:39.880
iBooks for that not for books i bought through the kindle store ah got it okay well anyhow i

02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:44.120
bought some of my schoolbooks that way so i can carry them around on my iphone got it all right

02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:49.720
well anyhow um kindle is of course you know it's it's a device that you know most you read books on

02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:57.160
it but now apparently there's some games showing up on kindle i guess uh scrabble is on kindle

02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:01.320
right now i didn't even know that but yeah scrabble actually made its way to the top of the kindle

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:08.600
charts but um apparently some folks have ported zork one zork two zork three and mini zork to the

02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:13.480
kindle i didn't even know there was a mini zork but yeah zork one zork two and zork three are now

02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:19.080
all out on the kindle that's kind of awesome um now i don't think the kindle has too much in the

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:23.240
way of a keyboard so i'm not sure how awesome this is i mean i think it has some keyboard but it's

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:29.320
kind of small so i don't know how much fun this is to play but uh yeah it's out there and uh so

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:35.000
you are standing in front of a white mailbox don't get eaten by a guru you can experience it all over

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:44.120
again there it is let's uh go to the mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we're gonna

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:54.120
open up ye old mailbag dive in the one email one email one email but it's fantastic well to be fair

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:58.760
i failed on getting the show up on time so we'll probably have double the emails next week rob

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:04.760
fails sorry i was sick leave me alone he brought me he brought me pita chips so i sure did and

02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:12.040
asoda hey olr crew azhp here if you may recall rob had mentioned a few episodes ago that poo

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:17.080
ping would be a funny name for social networking site for people on the toilet that's right because

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:23.240
of a ping.com remember well i'm sorry apple's ping well i decided to run with that idea and

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:32.920
i'm moderately proud to bring you www.poo-ping.com wow i whipped it together over about two weeks

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:37.640
though since i worked a full-time job i was only able to put an hour or two a day into it

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:42.920
its goal is to be like yelp for public restrooms through a number of factors prevent me from

02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:47.480
devoting much time to it the aforementioned full-time job and my lack of any sort of prowess

02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:52.520
relating to design related to design the site does not have any features currently it only supports

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:56.840
adding restrooms to the database and writing reviews for those restrooms a google account is

02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:01.240
required to submit restrooms or reviews don't worry it's using google's official google app

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:06.840
engine api so you don't have to worry about me stealing your information or anything this is

02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:10.200
just the first website i've written on my own it was basically just an excuse to learn new

02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:14.360
programming languages for the technically inclined it's written in python using the google app engine

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:21.640
sdk with some django integration or is it django i don't know so it's not too well polished maybe

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:26.440
if i find myself unemployed in the future or if you hire jamie i can get back to it or she can

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:31.960
make it look pretty i appreciate it if the crew or the chat could throw out some ideas that you

02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:36.280
would like to see on the site such as an iphone app google map integration foursquare style

02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.160
check-ins a friends list twitter style updates experience points based ranking system for adding

02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:47.320
restrooms etc i can draw you pictures of poop is that really necessary yes who knows i might one

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:52.200
day implement them anyway hope you enjoyed it as bare bones as it is your friendly neighborhood

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:59.320
programmer azhp that's pretty amazing i'm looking at the site poo-ping.com and my bathroom on it

02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:05.320
there it is the site for picky poopers there it is it's actually there and there's already a one

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:13.640
review on there for next tag i don't and it just talks about where there's four stalls apparently

02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:19.560
and uh there's paper towels is the hand drying mechanism and the faucet type and uh you can

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.760
actually write a review there and talk all about it in the comment on this restroom the faucet on

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.000
the left doesn't shut off all the way unless you push down on it harder restroom is fairly clean

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:35.240
and paper towels and toilet paper get restocked often i'm gonna review the toilet out back i was

02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:38.920
gonna say i should review the the bathroom at jack-in-the-box i was at before the show tonight

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:45.000
because uh when i turned on the sink it was so it was like on full blast i got shot with water

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.760
and it just looked like i crapped my pant like the front of my pants and i was so mad

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:54.440
so i was gonna write a nasty review of the sink there i don't know the address for this place

02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:00.360
uh-oh you have to look it up can i review my bathroom

02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:06.040
you can put whatever you want in there you want your address on there there it is poo-ping.com

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.280
that's amazing i love when our show inspires these ideas that's that's the ultimate tribute thank you

02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:16.040
guys so much so salacious pop is saying he just thought of a mailbag for you he didn't send this

02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:20.840
in the email but i think this is a great question and i can't wait to hear the rants this inspires

02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:27.160
dark sakura have you seen the new gap logo and do you feel the logo would be helped by comic sans

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:34.200
or papyrus what the fuck let me look at it their logo is pretty weak have you not seen the new gap

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:39.880
logo it's like crap i need a logo right now all this new controversy no just go to gap.com i'm

02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:45.000
going and you can see it and it's there's their new logo it's in helvetica yeah that's it that's

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:52.520
not helvetica it's a gap with a box i like it job really because like all these designers everywhere

02:10:52.520 --> 02:11:00.920
are pissed they have saying that it's way better no no no no it's i like the old one better but

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:09.880
this isn't bad the old one just was better it was more iconic i think i think the square is retarded

02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:15.000
yeah i don't know it's not really no the old one was better

02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:21.400
um i just got linked this uh website that apparently has all the sounds you need

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:27.560
to run a radio show here and so um we could list the uh gap logo on poo-ping.com

02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.040
this is what i will say about this if i may

02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:45.800
what if this was the first time this they'd ever done a logo as in like if they hadn't had that

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.760
nice one they had before this would be fine why did they feel they needed to change their logo

02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:57.640
in the first place it's too swiss i think the best comment i read anywhere about the new logo

02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:03.560
is that it makes old navy look like the better brand i mean old navy looks a little classier

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:10.040
than gap's new logo it looks like the american apparel logo it looks like target target uses

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.600
helvetica it kind of looks like american apparel to me have you ever seen that yeah and it's too

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:20.120
too close it looks like um what's that tax place uh you know you know h&r block yeah it looks like

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:26.520
h&r block font you knew that they changed their font from futura who did ikea oh really they based

02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:32.040
it off of a different one their theirs was like a super wide version of futura which i like that

02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:41.560
font is pretty but they changed it i don't know i just keep in mind i love helvetica a lot this just

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:48.600
did you see the movie yes i have i have a copy all right i have the book i'm not joking is it

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.720
all printed in helvetica yes it's called helvetica homage to a typeface i'll go get it no it's all

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:58.440
right that's all right i don't care no one car all right i was gonna put it on the all right

02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:02.040
fine you can take a picture and all that uh we gotta get into the f-years of the week though

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:06.520
this is the part of the show where we get really angsty and uh get mad and throw things

02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:14.680
so

02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:30.440
a few to my cat's butt for being too fat to lift onto her toilet box

02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:39.160
her her litter box and pp in it properly and it's mostly my fault i should have exercised my cat

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:47.400
more but she only is able to pee in about half of the box and the rest of the pee will get on

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:53.400
the floor for for the record shermy's bathroom is in the bathroom closet and we have the bottom part

02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.680
of the door sawed off so she can just climb under there and do her business in private

02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:02.280
do her business in private um but she misses the box so like the p goes under her box and

02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:06.920
that means i have to lift her box and clean it which is really disgusting and um but she has

02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:15.480
not pooped during the show that's great somebody linked us in the chat room i guess there's this

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:20.600
website where you can generate your own gap logo and someone made olr there it is i could do that

02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:26.760
in two seconds in photoshop nice that was laser one two three four five four three two one sent that

02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:32.840
all right uh loki you have an fu of the week uh if you leave the cats live in my backyard because

02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:40.760
they are pooping everywhere and it smells like poop everywhere and they need to leave the premise

02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:49.960
is that it you need to leave the premise of the premises whatever all right if that's it then

02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:56.040
my fu of the week i have a few uh fu to me being sick uh because it sucked and i've been sleeping

02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:01.480
like 12 and 13 hours this weekend which is sad because i'm not gonna get to see alan next weekend

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:07.480
so kind of sucks that i spent this whole weekend sleeping um so yeah boo to that boo to the fact

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:13.000
that um midway mania was closed to california venture when i went um this last time so i'm

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.320

02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:41.960

my mic isn't working for ventrilo might be similar so i don't know why you would even remove that

02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:36.520
feature it's stupid yeah it sucks it depends also i i thought it was always a sound blaster feature

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:41.240
like if you have a sound blaster well i have i have a non-sound blaster card in my laptop here

02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:48.200

02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:53.000
the other week or we were going to and we couldn't get his skype thing to record it just and i tried

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.240
everything we do here in studio to make the show work and it would work over there of course we use

02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:04.200
an external mixing board too which i'm sure helps but we're just irritating ah so we'll try again

02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:09.080
all right meanwhile back to the show we're gonna get to your phone calls soon not just yet but very

02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.680
soon in the meantime though we got just a couple quick stories for you guys before we open up the

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:20.680
skype line at 1877 game olr yes it's interesting um you know sam ramie is working on a earth defense

02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:27.000
force movie now obviously this is not anything to do with d3 game earth defense force the greatest

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:34.840
game on earth um but it is you know something where you know apparently uh aliens are invading

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:40.840
and the earth defense force has to you know stop them from invading or whatnot uh the details of

02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:45.320
the movie are very rough right now here's the interesting part though and i'm not sure if sam

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:55.320
ramie's aware of this but apparently um earth defense force uh is actually a copyrighted name

02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:05.480
by d3 so huh that's awkward um and actually i did see here it looks like they do have a synopsis for

02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:09.880
earth defense force the sam ramie version apparently edf follows a u.s military unit that

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:14.440
has been deployed to rescue a sub that has accidentally run afoul in chinese waters

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:20.040
apparently a dogfight ensues and both uh but both the chinese and american planes are shot

02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:25.720
out of the water by three alien spacecraft they go on to destroy landmarks and key military

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:31.720
structures it's a race against the clock as humans try to create weaponry and vehicles that can

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:36.680
sustain another attack just make a goddamn fucking earth defense force movie based off earth defense

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:40.440
force the game well they were going to call it the last airbender but unfortunately that was taken

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:54.920
too my rating is up on pooping.com nice for the outback bathroom i mean earth defense forces it's

02:18:54.920 --> 02:19:01.960

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:50.520
boo-hoo hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is x-link hi x-link what's on your

02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:57.720
mind hey never much you're like the new ron now sorry i have a cold an old orange island radio

02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:03.640
first let's tell the people how on nba gm to get the democrats and republicans unlocked if you

02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:11.240
want to play at them please do all right for the democrats at the press a to start screen if you

02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:17.160
enter left 13 times followed by the plus you should be able to unlock them for the republicans

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:24.760
if you press on the same screen right 13 times followed by the plus you are unlock them that's

02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:29.480
funny i get it because the democrats are on the left and the republicans are on the right

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:37.080
then you press down 13 times i don't know what happens if you push down 13 times the game crashes

02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:43.160
no i don't know if you push nothing yeah nothing happens because that's what happens from the

02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:51.400
p-side down is the tea party i get it all right by the way laser 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 is yelling at

02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:56.120
me in chat saying just say laser we had this problem for i don't like just laser don't put

02:21:56.120 --> 02:22:00.440
all those numbers in your name i like laser 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 it gives it gives it class

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:07.880
just say change your name to laser 3 2 1 contact it's even better i i that's even better i i like

02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:14.200
that laser 3 2 1 contact i like that now thinking of the 3 2 1 contact from electric company but

02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:18.840
that's all different scenario altogether that's right now it's stuck in your head yes definitely

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:24.040
but no but these two were the probably one of the hardest ones for a bit but i don't know how

02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:29.480
somebody came across it but i was reading a few websites and somebody closely posted on there of

02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:34.520
how to do this so that was quite interesting because for a while they're like here's the code

02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:40.360
unlock unlock the bc boys here's the code to unlock the espn and the rest of the stuff you

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:45.320
pretty much are on your own unlock so well and those codes are very easy to remember actually

02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:50.760
left 13 times that's not very hard to remember right 13 times that's not like telling almost

02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:54.680
something did by a fluke like oh let's see what you mean hit left and see what happens is like

02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:58.280
all of a sudden you know you hit the button and it happened you know you hit her chime and it's

02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:03.000
like okay what did i unlock oh look i just unlocked you know and to unlock nba and nba

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.160
and to unlock nba elite you smash the remote against the ground 13 times

02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:15.480
or track the desk in half you throw it out the window yeah i was gonna say it's not like any

02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:19.320
of us have bought nba jam yet i don't know maybe there's a few wee people that have bought it yet

02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:24.040
bought it so far but i sure haven't yet so you know what to be honest i was going to buy it and

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:28.200
then i saw the $50 price tag and that really turned me off i'm like why the hell would i pay

02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:34.520
$50 for a just updated version of the game that came out so long ago nba jam is fucking rad it

02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:38.760
was going to be an xbox live arcade game oh i freaking loved it i loved it playing in arcade

02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:42.600
i remember playing all the time going through all the teams and trying to then as soon as i beat one

02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.320
team with all the teams to go you know and it was like a weekly thing it was like nfl blitz did the

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:51.400
same uh same thing growing up with nfl blitz you start with one team you go through and then you

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:55.320
try because you're always trying to compete with everybody else and that in your local arcade you

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:59.480
try to be that top number one spot so i wish it would have done something like that but unfortunately

02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:05.640
if you don't have the capability of online to keep uh global stats of that sort which kind of

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:12.600
ruins it i mean especially if you play just single player um i uh you got to admit though you you've

02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.280
got to play the obama versus palin you know you want to play that and then accuse the game of

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:23.080
being biased you know you want to do that and the computer cheats yes all right well anything else

02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:28.920
on your mind tonight x-link what do you think about cataclysm coming out pretty soon um i'm

02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:34.680
scared about the new patch because it's going to change everything and as a holy paladin like on

02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:40.760
the beta i i don't know if i can heal the same that i do now it's weird and it's a rep pally i

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:45.000
died like twice and that never happens rep pallys don't die like ever unless they really suck

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.720
well i mean in raids they do and in instances they do but i mean soloing like you never die

02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:54.520
so it's it's i'm a little scared about some of the um juggling they're doing to talents but you know

02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:58.840
these things have a way of working themselves out and you know by the time the game actually

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:03.320
comes out it'll be cool but um yeah if it's true that the patch is hitting this week which most

02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:08.520
people seem to kind of agree it is it's gonna be a game changer so we'll see but you know they

02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:13.240
always do these major patches right before so it'll be interesting do all things real quick

02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:17.480
thank you for turning me on the game next week unfortunately i wish i got on a week before but

02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:22.440

02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:26.280

this week on law and order somebody divides by zero

02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:28.360
uh okay i have actual news here we can talk all right fine since no one wants to call go ahead

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:35.160
um so there's some pretty cool stuff coming our way at least on um the ipad iphone um you know

02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:40.600
app store that type of thing uh choo choo rocket's headed for the ipad which is kind of cool and

02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:46.680
apparently um you know that's gonna be all sorts of awesome then uh dead rising mobile

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:55.160
is coming to uh the iphone and ipod as well and of course that would be very stripped down version

02:28:55.160 --> 02:29:00.200
of dead rising much like the wii version was also they're going to be doing something very similar

02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:06.840
to xbox live's game room called capcom arcade which will host a bunch of virtual arcade cabinets

02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:13.640
that require the purchase of tokens uh to play the games otherwise everything is going to be

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:20.600
a lot easier to play the games uh to play the games otherwise you can um permanently access

02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:26.600
each game for a larger one-time fee uh the arcade service will launch uh before dead rising mobile

02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:32.600
and will feature street fighter 2 ghosts and ghouls or i'm sorry ghouls and ghosts uh 1942 and commando

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:37.400
so this is why no one else wants to get on board with game room because now they're like oh well

02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:43.800
i don't know uh another full motion video game is coming to the app store as well uh this one is

02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:50.040
kind of a neat one i remember drawing some of the characters from it brain dead 13 is coming um as

02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:58.680
well to the app store very soon um sonic 1 sonic 2 super monkey ball and fancy star 2 are all

02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:04.840
discounted on itunes right now um you can get those all for about a dollar 99 instead of six

02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:09.000
dollars each but they suck on the iphone i mean i'm not i'm not gonna mince words they're not

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:16.360
fun not bad uh okay i'll give you that but these other ones honestly if you have a 360 or a ps3

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:21.400
go get that genesis collection the sonic mega genesis collection it's like in the bargain bin

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:24.840
right now you can probably find it for ten dollars it's fantastic and it's like the greatest ten

02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:28.200
dollars you'll spend if you like the retro stuff if you don't like the retro stuff then don't

02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:34.040
bother but otherwise like if if that last story sounded interesting to you and you own a 360 or

02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:42.200
a ps3 go buy the mega genesis collection it's a much better deal trust me and then minecraft

02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.800
eight seven seven game olr our username on skype is orange entre isn't it weird to think that

02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:29.480
everything you're seeing there that theater that you're seeing all those pictures in

02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:32.120
it's that best buy that's now the parking lot for the best buy

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:37.960
you park your cars there now it's sad and then they have something else that they're

02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:45.320
building that looks like a theater it's a sports authority store ah lame that's the same reaction

02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:53.640
i had no one wants to go to the sports authority that is the same reaction i had travis columbia

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:59.160
in that particular night yes that's fantastic um that particular night was the like switch night

02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:03.240
or tacky horror they sometimes call it where the guys play girl parts and the girls play guy parts

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:06.200
that's why there's pictures of me as magenta because i did that for one of them you played a

02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:11.800
