1
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:16,087
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017 to 2010.

2
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:24,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans petitioned for a new Bomani game release, the developers of Game Room were set to close, and Blizzard takes the enablers of cheating to court.

3
00:00:31,843 --> 00:00:37,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:42,888
[SPEAKER_07]: We are that show dedicated to video games and gaming and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,549
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're that show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,910
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.

8
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:53,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I apparently feel it boiling water.

10
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:56,195
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bad.

11
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,557
[SPEAKER_07]: That means you're not going to be able to cook anything if you can't boil water.

12
00:00:58,577 --> 00:01:02,601
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be in my league where it's like Hot Pockets and Easy Mac and Cheese.

13
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:09,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I was making fake coffee for my French press and didn't boil enough water, so I'm boiling more water.

14
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:10,268
[SPEAKER_07]: You fail at boiling water.

15
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,210
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be a losing screen.

16
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Boil water the game.

17
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:14,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

18
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in Cooking Mama, it's Boiling Mama.

19
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello, but don't boil mama.

20
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be...

21
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:21,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Triple Bacon Pizza

22
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:46,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see, last week it was double bacon pizza, and I seem to distinctly remember the one and only Loki saying something about triple bacon pizza is too much bacon.

23
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:49,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if it did triple or quadruple, so I'm testing both.

24
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:54,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost did quadruple today, but I was like, ramp it up slowly.

25
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good, actually.

26
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:58,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to point out I have a terrible Loki impersonation.

27
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:00,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It's triple bacon pizza.

28
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:01,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what I'm doing.

29
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:01,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

30
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:02,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Also say hello.

31
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,277
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a very special guest tonight.

32
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:05,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I promised this last week.

33
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,839
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't heard the podcast, though, we do have a very special guest.

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:18,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You could call it a little bit of all games cross promotion in a way because we have here live in studio, not on Skype, but here live in studio all the way from Under Sedation Live.

35
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:19,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Jessica Harper.

36
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:19,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica Harper.

37
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:22,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello people, yes, I'm actually sitting on the floor.

38
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, as opposed to on the toilet.

39
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:27,632
[SPEAKER_04]: As opposed to on the toilet, which is where I usually am right before the show.

40
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:29,714
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, lovely Jessica?

41
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:36,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I am doing just fabulously, and yeah, it's kind of cool to have like... We had our all games moment just a few minutes ago where it was...

42
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:42,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf and OLR and Understation Live all in one little happy family right there.

43
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of cool.

44
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:43,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

45
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So while Jessica brought it up let me get that out there.

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:54,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We do tape live at All Games Radio www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

47
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you are listening live make sure you join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

48
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:00,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's everything?

49
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:00,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's good.

50
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Jessica Harper, you might know her online as Iguana Girl.

51
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:07,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

52
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's because you are actually an iguana?

53
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, actually, yes.

54
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:17,874
[SPEAKER_04]: In the middle of the night, I just have these moments where I turn green and I don't turn into the Hulk, I just turn into an iguana.

55
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:25,678
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, the nickname originally was given to me by a friend because I had an obsession with iguanas.

56
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an iguana at the time and

57
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:37,763
[SPEAKER_04]: and Girl, G-R-R-L, was because I was always the video gamer geek out of all of the boys that worked over at this ISP, this internet service provider that we were at.

58
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:40,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was the, you know, the girl.

59
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:44,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't totally, you know, frilly and prissy and all that.

60
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:49,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Now see, I always thought it might have been a hey girl type of thing, but I guess that's G-U-R-L.

61
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:49,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

62
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when Alan types in an email to me, he'll say G-U-R-R-L.

63
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, mine was more, you know, the...

64
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Female Empowerment, Grr.

65
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd want to smash.

66
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:02,674
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of stuck.

67
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been using that nickname since like 97 now, I think.

68
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:07,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

69
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, just always been that way.

70
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:09,759
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

71
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:15,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Jessica's here tonight for, you know, well, obviously we've been doing this show forever and she's never sat in.

72
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you, well, maybe it's been a long time if you haven't.

73
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:19,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done top 10s.

74
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:24,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary, maybe like a long time ago, but it's definitely been several years since you've been here in the studio with us.

75
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:30,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the last time was probably back at your place, like in Rancho.

76
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:35,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we were doing the crossover stuff for DDR Freak Radio, and I was like, hey, our shows can get along, it's great, we're having fun.

77
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we do the top ten Bimani songs of that year?

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,741
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I remember going out to Folsom.

79
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, I think we taped the show or something.

80
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:57,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, regardless, it's been a heck of a long time since Jessica's been on the show, which is kind of bittersweet in a way because Jessica and I kind of started in a way a lot of our internet radio stuffs together over on Under Sedation Live when the head honcho over there, Travis, used to live out here.

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'm back, bitches.

82
00:04:58,902 --> 00:04:59,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The HBIC.

83
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:23,497
[SPEAKER_07]: For Understation Live, Travis used to live out here in Sac, and Jessica, myself, and Travis were all kind of the start of that show So this show, in a way, Orange Sounds Radio, in a way, I don't want Travis' ego to get too big if he's listening, but in a way In a way, please No, it is, it's a spin-off of Understation Live No, because you started OLR pretty soon, I think we were like right in tandem with DDR Freak Radio and OLR

84
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:25,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Right about the same time

85
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:59,157
[SPEAKER_07]: but like but for but you know and I think I mentioned this during the marathon show or something like you know it's it's kind of you know funny the way things work sometimes because obviously this is 10 years ago and at this time you know we're we're in our 20s and just very different and there was a lot of stuff going on and a lot of

86
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:06,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I was personally looking back in a very toxic situation at the time that didn't bode itself well to the future.

87
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, things happen.

88
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, Jessica and I kind of, we had a little breakup for a while.

89
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,920
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're cool now.

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's great that she's back in the radio business.

91
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,321
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've listened to a few episodes of Understation Live.

92
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether Travis knows it or not, I really do listen once in a while when I can.

93
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:23,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

94
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:24,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a tie of shock.

95
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:25,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

96
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I know all the smack he's talking about me over there.

97
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:27,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think, I don't know.

98
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,525
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, no, I think it's great.

99
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:31,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just awesome.

100
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,389
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, what I should have done is I should have made him play the voicemail.

101
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering that that voicemail was recorded during that same trip where you played DDR for the first time.

102
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, and I don't have a copy of that.

103
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:50,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Travis, if you're listening, if you want to, you know, later on when we're taking calls.

104
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:50,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

105
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

106
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:55,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And the voicemail she's referring to is, I guess we should tell this story real quick.

107
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:57,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get into the gaming news and all that stuff in a little bit.

108
00:06:57,747 --> 00:07:07,690
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way Jessica and I kind of got into DDR in the first place, and if it wasn't for DDR, I would probably not have ultimately met DarkSakura and Loki, at least in the way that I did.

109
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,752
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way Jessica and I got into DDR in the beginning is that we went to the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Picture Show convention.

110
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:15,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we just, what happened?

111
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:18,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We just kind of said screw it to the convention one night, right?

112
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:18,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

113
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:25,257
[SPEAKER_04]: We just decided that we were going to go hit some arcades because we were bored out of our minds and there was this 1.5 machine.

114
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:25,957
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

115
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:30,680
[SPEAKER_07]: This machine that was flashing and it was saying, I'm playing super gay music.

116
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Come play.

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

118
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Super gay music.

119
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:33,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob went like a fly.

120
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm off to a flame.

121
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:35,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

122
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:36,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

123
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:41,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's like, oh, it has a pad and I wonder what we're supposed to do.

124
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:41,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

125
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,208
[SPEAKER_07]: What ultimately drew you to the machine, though?

126
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:46,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It couldn't be the uber gay music.

127
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,012
[SPEAKER_07]: You must have just been like, it's colors, and you use your feet.

128
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:53,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I had a new shiny moment, I'm guessing.

129
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, and what was our first song?

130
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:58,058
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember?

131
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:01,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it had to have been the one star Have You Never Been Mellow.

132
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:02,968
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

133
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we pump it up to Boom Boom Dollar?

134
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: We went Boom Boom Dollar first and we failed.

135
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:17,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we proceeded to go right back and go, okay, well maybe we should try this again, but let's do it on an easier level.

136
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we ended up doing Butterfly.

137
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:26,452
[SPEAKER_04]: and then once we beat Butterfly we went back to Boom Boom Dollar and I think we ended up beating it the second time.

138
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:49,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was a little bit of ego there because I remember we used to play the old Busta here in the US it was Busta Groove but of course that drives Jamie bonkers because overseas it was Busta Move but we didn't know any better at the time because we were just like ooh flashy so but we used to play those games and really liked it so we were like oh we're the masters at Busta Move or Busta Groove we'll kick this thing's ass and it's like failed.

139
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember going to your old apartment and playing on that one pad that was for some Disney game.

140
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:01,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like some child's... I thought it was like a Britney's dance pad or something.

141
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:11,538
[SPEAKER_07]: The very first... Before DDR was on PlayStation 1, they actually released a Disney's Jungle Book, Jungle Blue game.

142
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came with this dance pad that was probably made for a seven-year-old.

143
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:21,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it was a cheap little dance game that I think was really just existed to beat DDR to the market.

144
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But it had some funny Jungle Book songs on it.

145
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:23,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cute.

146
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you could dance to, you know, I want to walk like you, talk like you, too.

147
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:29,525
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you could kind of dance to it.

148
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:29,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cute.

149
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:35,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And then DarkSakura, she was kind of like, by this time we knew her, and she was kind of like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

150
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:38,409
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a little plug in the back and you need to burn a copy of Third Mix.

151
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming over.

152
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Rob, get me a paperclip.

153
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:42,491
Okay.

154
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:48,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in those days when you could do the single swap, which I never learned how to do anything but the single swap.

155
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:48,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, screw it.

156
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just get this little thing and plug it in.

157
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:50,996
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I was lucky.

158
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:54,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got to have mine semi-professionally modded by Brad.

159
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:59,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I remember a bunch of folks came over one night.

160
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was the first night we were playing third mix.

161
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And weren't you fortunate enough not to?

162
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:06,709
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

163
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a later Las Vegas trip that you and I took where we went to that same DDR machine.

164
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:40,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

165
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:41,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Very drunk.

166
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

167
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:42,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

168
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:43,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And called Rob.

169
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,716
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, hey, we're actually wasn't exactly the same because it was a fourth or a fourth plus.

170
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we went to win a circus circus.

171
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but there was a fourth or a fourth plus at the time.

172
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

173
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,721
[SPEAKER_04]: They had removed the 1.5 and they moved it to the front of that same arcade area.

174
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:03,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for those that don't know, Circus Circus in Vegas has like 5 billion arcades to it.

175
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:04,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

176
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:10,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's like one arcade where we ended up finding a karaoke machine, but that's, you know, a different story for...

177
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:12,687
[SPEAKER_04]: for Travis to find the music.

178
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:20,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole nother episode and that'll probably be on Understation Live when Travis is like, hmm, let's make an ass of Rob this week again.

179
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I got me a car.

180
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:24,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

181
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:27,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like you leave them so many opportunities.

182
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:29,540
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

183
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,100
[SPEAKER_07]: What can I say?

184
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I was young and dumb in my 20s and I'm young and dumb now.

185
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:32,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, bye.

186
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like a whole list of Rob quotes that go through my head.

187
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised there's not a Rob soundboard that Travis has.

188
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we actually considered it.

189
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:45,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike fail.

190
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:46,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike fail.

191
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:46,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Boop, boop.

192
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:47,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

193
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:48,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Better?

194
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to stop and get you a cord.

195
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,636
[SPEAKER_07]: If I hadn't driven five hours today, I was going to stop and get you a cord.

196
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:56,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a trip to Miggle.

197
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,140
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.

198
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:05,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sunnyvale Golf Land where I was drinking out of the Pepsi bone and I gave Rob a drink and he gave it back to me.

199
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And right when I'm drinking, Rob says, by the way, I have gay.

200
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:11,208
[SPEAKER_07]: You cut out right as you said that.

201
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:12,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

202
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mic sucks.

203
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:13,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

204
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:14,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the mic.

205
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:14,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cord.

206
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:15,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

207
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:22,746
[SPEAKER_02]: But, no, I let Rob take a drink out of my big Pepsi bone, and then I took it back to take a drink, and Rob says, by the way, I have gay.

208
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:24,869
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best ever.

209
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,270
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

210
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a complaint about the PlayStation charging controller thing.

211
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,770
[SPEAKER_02]: The little micro USB cable thing.

212
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too damn short.

213
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:03,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, do people in Japan have no room in their apartment?

214
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:04,335
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I guess they don't.

215
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:09,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played some Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they totally stole the ship.

216
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:12,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the Shiva sisters who are sexy.

217
00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:16,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, they turn into a freaking bike.

218
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:17,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

219
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:59,667
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't really change the way they look or anything because the Breen wear this like suit that keeps it you know zero degrees cold inside because they all want to look like you know Princess Leia in her outfit from when she went to rescue Han Solo yeah

220
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:00,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

221
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:01,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so anyway.

222
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:06,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played, uh, lots of Plants vs. Zombies.

223
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:07,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

224
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:12,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played, um... I tried Narbacular Drop again.

225
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still confusing as hell.

226
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:15,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh...

227
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:20,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have a grudge.

228
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:21,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Mud.

229
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:29,318
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, I watched three Ju-on movies also during the course of yesterday and the day before.

230
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were fantastic, as always.

231
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura's responding to comments in our chat room at chat.orange.com.

232
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can make the grudge noise.

233
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,362
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't have Tourette's.

234
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just...

235
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:42,764
[SPEAKER_04]: My little side giggle was because I saw that Travis was saying something.

236
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, did he join chat?

237
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:47,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh oh.

238
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,287
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, I will torment all.

239
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh oh.

240
00:14:51,249 --> 00:15:01,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means he's probably recording the whole show tonight to snip out the really bad and horrible sounding parts and he'll string it all together and make it sound like I said something really bad.

241
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:02,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if I say it now, then he'll cut it out.

242
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,290
[SPEAKER_02]: and Spazinator for the record.

243
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't have a micro USB extension, so it didn't work.

244
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:13,638
[SPEAKER_05]: You have USB extension cables you can get.

245
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:19,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I was busy playing the game last night in my pajamas and I am not one of those people who goes to Walmart in my pajamas.

246
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:22,587
[SPEAKER_05]: But you should have a fully charged controller.

247
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:28,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't want to use a hub because the only hub that I have is my TARDIS hub that was a gift to me from the lovely Tiara.

248
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:34,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And my TARDIS hub stays firmly attached to my computer.

249
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:37,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But it makes TARDIS noise when you plug it in.

250
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple of friends that have that.

251
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:40,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute.

252
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:41,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

253
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it for your gaming week?

254
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:43,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

255
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:45,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic screwdriver doesn't work though.

256
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boo-hoo, cry, sad.

257
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, hey, how was your gaming week?

258
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:52,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play a whole lot.

259
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:56,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a lot of iPad games, or iPod games, I guess.

260
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:59,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep wanting to call it an iPhone, but, I mean, it's the same damn thing.

261
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:01,523
[SPEAKER_07]: How about iOS?

262
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's the universal system they run on.

263
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:05,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, I can do iOS.

264
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:07,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Some iOS games.

265
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually downloaded Bookworms.

266
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear, my co-worker...

267
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Download shit and he's like, he's like, yeah, I got this game.

268
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:18,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, oh, I got to get that.

269
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:19,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

270
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:24,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I jumped on the bookworm train good 10 years late.

271
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:29,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's pretty fun and played quite a bit of that.

272
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:32,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, my wife was playing at the same time on her iPod.

273
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was fun.

274
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I've been playing a lot of Climber.

275
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:38,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I saw that.

276
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:08,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually played that while I was waiting for my pizza to be done.

277
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:09,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they add fire?

278
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:11,036
[SPEAKER_05]: There is fire in there.

279
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:12,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they did make it better.

280
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,661
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I played it, I was like, there's only one awesome thing this game is missing, and that's fire.

281
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:19,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got lots of skulls.

282
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:22,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It has mountains with earthworm-type tentacle things coming out of it.

283
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,787
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got pentagrams.

284
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:28,790
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be awesome.

285
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

286
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:30,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Best 99 cents ever.

287
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:33,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that away right now.

288
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you played this week?

289
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:38,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey John, we're calling to you.

290
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:39,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto.

291
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:40,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

292
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:50,770
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but seriously, I don't know if you've heard the song yet that's in this game, and I will pull it up real quick.

293
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's really loud.

294
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read some comments from chat while you're doing that.

295
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:55,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

296
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Loomies has a suggestion in our chatroom.

297
00:17:57,793 --> 00:18:01,315
[SPEAKER_07]: You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.

298
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:02,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that, DarkSakura?

299
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:03,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Loomies in our chatroom?

300
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:04,277
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

301
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:07,939
[SPEAKER_07]: You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.

302
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:09,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

303
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so awesome.

304
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,281
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a little bit.

305
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:52,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

306
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It's potato-potato to me.

307
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's all the same.

308
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

309
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:57,204
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

310
00:18:57,224 --> 00:19:04,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orangeandre.com SalaciousPop says, Bookworm and Bookworm Adventures is awesome, except for when it gets really hard and makes you feel stupid.

311
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,530
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very true.

312
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like, they were, like, dropping a bunch of letters that were on fire, and it's like Z-Q-U.

313
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, thanks!

314
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:12,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Love that.

315
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:14,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make Zikwika.

316
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:17,678
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I going to spell with Q-U-V-Z?

317
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:18,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Quijibo.

318
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like,

319
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nellie's like, I got to level 15.

320
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:27,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'm on level 12 with eight letters that I can't use all on fire.

321
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when you start looking for ass every single time.

322
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:31,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass, ass.

323
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Ass, ass, ass.

324
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:34,495
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I do.

325
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of words, may I point out a travesty against humanity?

326
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Lexulus no longer has solitaire mode.

327
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:42,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pissed off.

328
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you can continue.

329
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:47,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently the word dong is not an acceptable word in there.

330
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:49,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I had that and I could have knew.

331
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,629
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's what we need.

332
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,449
[SPEAKER_04]: We need the sexualized version of Bookworm.

333
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:58,111
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they did Words with Friends pirate edition, I don't see why they don't do Words with Friends sexy edition.

334
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:02,293
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is where I have my problems because I have a Blackberry.

335
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:05,634
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have like a Words with Friends-y clone thing?

336
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:06,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no.

337
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:08,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two folders of games.

338
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,135
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all OpenFaint compatible.

339
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:28,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I have half a folder of Game Center stuff.

340
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:34,687
[SPEAKER_05]: That should say something to you, Apple, that perhaps your Game Center is a little too little too late.

341
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:35,508
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

342
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:39,130
[SPEAKER_07]: On my iPhone, you know what I play that's open faint enabled more than anything else?

343
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,392
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commodore 64 collection that they have on the iPhone.

344
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so unsurprising.

345
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

346
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm currently mostly an active gamer, unfortunately.

347
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:15,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to circumstances regarding the relationship that I just came from, I had to sell off a lot of my systems.

348
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:20,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So that pretty much leaves me with my computer that's subpar for gaming.

349
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my little lappy, and I have a PS2.

350
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:24,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

351
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:24,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

352
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:32,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But primarily when it comes to games, I have a tendency to... I like to go towards puzzle games.

353
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:33,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I like...

354
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:40,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy style RPG, blah, blah, blah.

355
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be big into first-person shooters.

356
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:46,131
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really big thing for me when I first started gaming.

357
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:49,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to like to piss off the boys by, you know, fragging them constantly.

358
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:51,775
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to be like a Doom 2 girl, huh?

359
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:52,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a Quake 2 girl.

360
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

361
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:54,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

362
00:21:55,118 --> 00:22:01,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to actually go to a place that was here in Sacramento, actually in Citrus Heights, called Cosmic Drip Cyber Cafe.

363
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:02,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

364
00:22:03,464 --> 00:22:04,645
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:32,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a particular favorite game?

366
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:35,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides the DDR and 2DX we've been reminiscing about, do you have a favorite game?

367
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.

368
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:41,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

369
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:42,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Typing of the Dead.

370
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Typing of the Dead is up there.

371
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd probably get thrown out of the club if I said Final Fantasy VII, so...

372
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:54,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's anything wrong with Final Fantasy 7, love.

373
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I get thrown out of the club.

374
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,350
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a safe house.

375
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy 9.

376
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,031
[SPEAKER_07]: If you said Final Fantasy 14, I might have an issue.

377
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, see, again, I haven't been able to game much.

378
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:09,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I work too dang much, and so I don't get to sit down.

379
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:14,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately, my main game of choice, Price is Right on Facebook.

380
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:15,254
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

381
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Rob, they do have a free trial to Final Fantasy 14.

382
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:44,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd heard there's this whole free trial and exit I just, you know, and I gotta really stop hating on Final Fantasy XIV because I didn't play it outside the beta so I'm not being fair I'm only going off of what I heard and everything I've heard is kind of collaborates with my experience in the beta so I feel a little justified but I am being a hater, I guess I'll try it out Please do, I would love to hear your review on this game We should be recording while I play it

383
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:48,964
[SPEAKER_02]: You get some interesting new expletives to add to this show.

384
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:51,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else is pissed off that they renamed all the races?

385
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes no sense.

386
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're gonna give them different names.

387
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:58,215
[SPEAKER_05]: They're different races, even though they're exactly the same.

388
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:02,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta read this comment from chat, too, because SalaciousPop, I think, is right on the money here.

389
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:05,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky will stop the show if she says Final Fantasy VIII.

390
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:09,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have thrown her out if she said 8 was her favorite.

391
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:10,366
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

392
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

393
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:16,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, and I've even told Alan this.

394
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:19,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I kind of play up my hate for 8 on the show a little bit.

395
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:20,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hate on 8.

396
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:21,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Gunblade.

397
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:23,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sword and a gun together.

398
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,331
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really hated the whole magic drawing thing.

399
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It really ruined the game for me.

400
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:31,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was it.

401
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:31,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that.

402
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:32,652
[SPEAKER_07]: That was terrible.

403
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:33,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I must have blocked that out.

404
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,894
[SPEAKER_07]: But it did have a good story.

405
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I will agree with you.

406
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:40,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that it had the full screen battles as opposed to Final Fantasy VII's crop thing, that was neat.

407
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:42,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It did have its technological advances.

408
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:45,948
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will concede on some points, but it still sucks.

409
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:46,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

410
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if there's nothing else Jessica wants to share...

411
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:51,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's anything else.

412
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Video gaming-wise, that's usually the part of the show on USL where I go silent and just let the boys play.

413
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:02,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, I'll get an Xbox and start getting back into the swing of things.

414
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:02,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

415
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:12,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope maybe with some of the price drops that are rumored, either this holiday or next holiday, it'd be really easy for you to get either a Wii or a 360 and you can kind of pick right back up.

416
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:14,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be a 360.

417
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,700
[SPEAKER_05]: 360 used the refurbisher down to like $109.

418
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:44,055
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah it's pretty soon within the next month or two you should definitely ask Santa Claus for one you never know alright let me talk about my meet and meet week which is actually kind of short I don't have a whole lot to advertise because you know World of Warcraft kind of dominates a lot of things but I did play a couple new things I played Sonic 4 for a little bit and I can sort of see where Loki was disappointed in last week's review and if you didn't hear his thing on Sonic 4 go listen to last week's

419
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:48,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't like some of Sonic's controls.

420
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:53,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I felt like the whole acceleration part of Sonic felt really broken to me.

421
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:57,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the 0 to 60, if you'll call it, was really weird for me.

422
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:03,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my thing too, and this is not just a Sonic complaint, this is kind of a complaint of a lot of games that are coming out now.

423
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,059
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

424
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:32,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

425
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,255
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

426
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:56,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if necessarily Mega Man 10 was really the right step.

427
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:11,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually was a little disappointed in Mega Man 10 simply because Mega Man 10... I expected that Mega Man 10 was going to be this epic, epicness, tenth... I think Mega Man Universe and what's happening there is what I was expecting for Mega Man 10.

428
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Mega Man 10 as we got it felt like Mega Man 9 Part 2.

429
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,102
[SPEAKER_07]: If that makes any sense at all.

430
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:18,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, yes, I understand.

431
00:27:20,065 --> 00:27:21,306
[SPEAKER_07]: All the old games are kind of like that.

432
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

433
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:28,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I just expected the level of epicness to be raised rather than we're going to get away with the same joke that we did with Mega Man 9.

434
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:31,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that would make sense to anyone else.

435
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:31,775
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.

436
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Done once, it's brilliant.

437
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:34,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Done twice, it's a gimmick.

438
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:35,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

439
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly right.

440
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of where I was at with it.

441
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:46,306
[SPEAKER_02]: See, what I would want to see is that instead of them doing like what they did with X, if they did like a new X and made it all SNES-tastic.

442
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:50,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would have been like at least a slightly different gimmick and would have been kind of cool.

443
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever, it is what it is.

444
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,530
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like a bad game.

445
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, it was a little more forgettable than IX because it felt like the same joke as IX all over again.

446
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,874
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, how did I get from Sonic 4 to Mega Man?

447
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:03,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, whatever.

448
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:05,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this whole retro thing.

449
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think in a way...

450
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:26,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe it does relate, because in a way, that's where Sonic 4 lost some of its magic for me, is that we've already seen Sonic on Xbox Live Arcade, we've already seen Sonic 2, so it's kind of like to get the Sonic 4 and have it just be kind of like, oh, well now it's the HD graphics, and even when it's the HD graphics, it really doesn't, it just feels like a...

451
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:29,896
[SPEAKER_07]: A sharper Sonic 2, if you will.

452
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:31,157
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

453
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

454
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:36,079
[SPEAKER_07]: But, of course, there's going to be the hardcore Sonic fans that are just going to eat it up, and that's good.

455
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,159
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care, it's Sonic!

456
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:44,743
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you've got to admit, it is a little dumpy of them to be doing this whole splitting it up into the episodes to get more money out of it in the long run thing.

457
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:48,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think, especially now having played it, that was kind of a tacky move.

458
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:52,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's one that's going to come bite them when it comes to the sales of Episode 2.

459
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,067
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

460
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:54,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Prove me wrong, Sonic fans.

461
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:54,408
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

462
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:55,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Tasty

463
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,703
[SPEAKER_07]: You breed frogs and you breed them.

464
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:27,267
[SPEAKER_07]: You might have a purple frog with green spots and you made it with a white frog and you might get a purple frog with white spots.

465
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You from Easy Vibe is the pocket frog.

466
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:30,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally admit.

467
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like Derby Owners Club for frogs?

468
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Froggy Owners Club Froggy Owners Club

469
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,739
[SPEAKER_02]: New show, E-Hoarder, starring Rob Roberts.

470
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:00,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

471
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to remove a bunch of apps off of my iPod because I've actually maxed out the memory.

472
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:08,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I had like 6.5 gigs worth of apps on there.

473
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:14,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, a lot of them were like those 100 or 400 gig apps like the Monkey Island games.

474
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:18,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Multiple folks in chat are saying, so it's chocobo breeding.

475
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of like the chocobo breeding in a way.

476
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:22,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Except you can't... But no racing.

477
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:24,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Except you can't fly your chocobo over the mountains.

478
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:24,929
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

479
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:28,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And land in the giant crater so that you can get the materia.

480
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:39,399
[SPEAKER_07]: There are pay parts to this game, and that is, like, if you want to use, like, a growth potion to make your frog egg grow instantly and not have to wait 30 minutes, you can pay, like, 99 cents, or you can get the mail to move fat.

481
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:45,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, all this, like, impatient people bullshit, I can't believe anybody would spend money on, but I guess they're making money off it somehow.

482
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:47,024
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute!

484
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought shrivels.

485
00:31:15,684 --> 00:31:20,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, Rob, you basically defended all Farmville players all over the world.

486
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:22,368
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because Farmville's lame.

487
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:27,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, I am currently on dog-sitting duty for my mom's Farmville account.

488
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:29,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait.

489
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:30,933
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to explain this.

490
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:31,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

491
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:33,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your mom like super addicted to Farmville?

492
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:39,898
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom is super addicted to Farmville, Frontierville, that Treasure Island one, all that crap.

493
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And she has this farm full of animals and she is insisting that I watch her dogs.

494
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:48,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to feed her dogs because she's on vacation for a week.

495
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:52,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if there's actually some sort of money to be made for a service like that.

496
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,968
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

497
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:57,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Neopets and how you could just put them in the kennel?

498
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,671
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have something like that.

499
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:00,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

500
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a couple of them do.

501
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:03,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Hire the immigrant workers.

502
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:07,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mind hiring some from a damn hotel.

503
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I don't play Hotel City or anything.

504
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:15,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray Ayanami in our chatroom says, just shut down her accounts while she's gone.

505
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:16,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an intervention.

506
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Burn it to the ground!

507
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:22,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to, but I would probably not have a mother after that.

508
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:30,401
[SPEAKER_07]: and it would be like, you know, hey, this is Rob Roberts on CBS 13 and Jessica Harper was found dead this evening.

509
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Strangled to death by her mother.

510
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't feel any pressure here, but she's like, if you don't feed them every single day, they're going to die.

511
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,523
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to run away.

512
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,764
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to want to be part of my farm anymore.

513
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:44,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, mom, I'll feed your stupid dogs.

514
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:45,645
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like my mother.

515
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:51,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's on Facebook all the time saying, I didn't get my treat basket!

516
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:52,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my treat basket?

517
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:57,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, you know, in much more of a southern accent.

518
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all, I can't find my treat basket!

519
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:01,391
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

520
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:26,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I actually just posted something on Facebook a couple days ago that was, you know, the anti-parental tool for Facebook.

521
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:27,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know, an SNL skit.

522
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And I posted it up.

523
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:31,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, so mom, do I need this?

524
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically it's like talking about how, well, do you post things that your mom doesn't want to see?

525
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:39,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shows pictures of like him smoking a bong and what have you.

526
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,869
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently this tool is supposed to make everything all better.

527
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:45,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns the bong into like a saxophone.

528
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:45,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

529
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:50,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew and Sam drinking beer into like, I need to go buy some dungarees.

530
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:55,860
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to find it later on on break or something so you guys can play it because it's pretty humorous.

531
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,440
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll look for it.

532
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:56,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

533
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:57,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

534
00:33:57,842 --> 00:33:58,082
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

535
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's going to do it for my gaming week.

536
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to talk about a whole lot of other stuff.

537
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:03,006
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get into some other stuff tonight.

538
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:04,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Housekeeping.

539
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:05,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have a whole lot to add here.

540
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we doing a show on Halloween?

541
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing I've got to figure out.

542
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:10,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather not.

543
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:12,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were going to go to the Winchester Mystery House.

544
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:16,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I gotta work the next day.

545
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:17,597
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not my problem.

546
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:19,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid words.

547
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

548
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:25,849
[SPEAKER_02]: You should tell them that you celebrated a religious holiday and that you're exhausted from carousing.

549
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, it'll be boring in the dark.

550
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:30,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll see.

551
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

552
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:32,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Winchester Mystery House.

553
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,897
[SPEAKER_07]: We will probably pre-tape, I'm going to imagine, that week.

554
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:36,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll work something out.

555
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that sound right, guys?

556
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll probably pre-tape that week.

557
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:38,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Pre-tape sounds fine.

558
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,559
[SPEAKER_07]: But we won't be here on Halloween night itself.

559
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, shows on schedule as usual.

560
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, follow us on Twitter.

561
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

562
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:48,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of, if you want to be like my mom.

563
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,323
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom doesn't know about the OLR Twitter, I don't think.

564
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:51,884
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can follow us on Facebook.

565
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:55,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

566
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to mention one part of my gaming week.

567
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:58,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a new laptop.

568
00:34:59,188 --> 00:34:59,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

569
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:05,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an Asus G60JX which is just a Core i5

570
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:07,213
[SPEAKER_05]: PC.

571
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:08,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Core i5s are weird.

572
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:17,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, all those new core systems with the hypothetical threads and oh, we only overclock your system when it's not running hot and that kind of stuff.

573
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:18,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Strange.

574
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,933
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, it runs Grand Theft Auto and that's all I really needed to do.

575
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:22,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that complete your life?

576
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:25,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, for now.

577
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:33,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Our pal Bobby Blackwolf from before us here at Orange Lounge Radio says he will be doing a show because they don't get any trick-or-treaters where he's at.

578
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the trick-or-treater.

579
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:40,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we're not having a show, but that's okay.

580
00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:42,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby will be doing his marathon show on Halloween.

581
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:46,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned something about... Rob, since I've become a Jew, I've learned something about Halloween.

582
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,916
[SPEAKER_02]: You go shopping for costumes after Halloween so you can use them for Purim.

583
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually deciding between two costumes right now.

584
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:57,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you could use them for porn too.

585
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my Star Trek uniform would be good for sci-fi porn.

586
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:06,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, we went to a party USA or whatever.

587
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:07,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like this big old party store.

588
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:08,808
[SPEAKER_05]: They have tons of costumes and stuff.

589
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Or party city, whatever.

590
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,492
[SPEAKER_05]: See, we wanted to get Josh a Darth Vader costume.

591
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:16,133
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

592
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:17,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Darth Vader Darth Vader

593
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:38,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Darth Tater, not bad.

594
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:44,209
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but anyways, there was a wall of sexy costumes that they had.

595
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,309
[SPEAKER_05]: For babies?

596
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:46,710
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not for babies.

597
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get you a pedo bear costume.

598
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that would be awesome.

599
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:56,133
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd dress him up like pedo bear.

600
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Optimus Prime

601
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Sexy Optimus Prime.

602
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:31,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it's just weird.

603
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Sexy Chewbacca recently.

604
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:35,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Sexy Brian the Dog.

605
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, no, that does not need to be sexy.

606
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:40,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Spongebob.

607
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like, what?

608
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:43,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Spongebob.

609
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:44,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

610
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, you know... Spongebob no pants?

611
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,968
[SPEAKER_05]: The demand for slutty costumes is great, I guess.

612
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:55,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there's women that love Optimus Prime and love loose sex.

613
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:55,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

614
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:59,418
[SPEAKER_01]: New vibrator attachment for your transformer, Fox.

615
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:02,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Only if she makes the wah-wah-wah-wah noise.

616
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:06,285
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, chatroom, chat.orange.com.

617
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:09,348
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, Loki should dress his baby as Mario to match his bedroom.

618
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:11,350
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a toad costume would be cute, though.

619
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cute.

620
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:17,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been thinking about that because he has the wonderful mushroom hat that my co-worker got him.

621
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:18,077
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

622
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,058
[SPEAKER_05]: The Starman

623
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the little star.

624
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:52,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't Maggie in an episode of The Simpsons dressed up as a star?

625
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:54,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even remember that.

626
00:38:55,694 --> 00:38:58,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to love The Simpsons back when it was first on.

627
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:06,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the great thing about babies, because you can dress them in embarrassing outfits and they don't really understand until they're 18 and you get out the pictures.

628
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking 10.

629
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:15,537
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen on Facebook where my mother posted pictures of me and my brothers in our old Howling costumes.

630
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:16,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, good times.

631
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:17,759
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother was a Popple.

632
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:20,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of remember what a Popple is.

633
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:21,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I've apparently remade a friend.

634
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:22,304
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you?

635
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:25,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Jane of the Jungle.

636
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was wearing that leopard print thing.

637
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:32,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to dress up as a cheerleader from Glee

638
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:26,406
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, hold on, hold on, hold on And so I can come out on stage and say Hey, I look for my Halloween costume I'm a cheerleader from Glee And then turn around and I'll have a bunch of bullet holes in my back And say, after the Rocky episode aired I would go for that Because normally, you know, I can't stay on the show Okay, then here's my other thing Is that my second choice is that I want to dress up as Allison from Intervention She was the girl that inhaled the computer duster It's like I'm walking on sunshine Ha ha ha

639
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:28,635
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm thinking of that too.

640
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:29,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Would people get it though?

641
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,040
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had the computer duster and said that a lot, I might.

642
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:35,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still taking submissions though.

643
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:36,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I need some good ideas.

644
00:40:36,024 --> 00:40:37,105
[SPEAKER_07]: You could be Towley.

645
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:38,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Towley?

646
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:40,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get a big giant towel and put it over your head.

647
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,432
[SPEAKER_07]: People might take that the wrong way and call me a racist.

648
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.

649
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:44,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Towley?

650
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:45,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

651
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:46,856
[SPEAKER_02]: From South Park, right?

652
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:47,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

653
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,217
[SPEAKER_05]: How would they call you a racist?

654
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:49,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

655
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to roll it up into a cone for your head.

656
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:55,059
[SPEAKER_04]: My original plan was to be Dr. Horrible, but that would have taken some time.

657
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

658
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

659
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

660
00:40:57,901 --> 00:40:58,221
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

661
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:02,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica, before we get into some gaming news, which I know we've only been on the air about.

662
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be sexy Optimus Prime.

663
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:06,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Sexy Fat Optimist Prime.

664
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:07,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

665
00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:09,206
[SPEAKER_07]: My butt hanging out.

666
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:13,227
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know, that might turn somebody on.

667
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:15,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be Alan.

668
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:16,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be like, what are you doing?

669
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:18,429
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what, what are you doing?

670
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we'd gotten past all of this, Rob.

671
00:41:22,932 --> 00:41:24,013
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only 40 minutes into the show.

672
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't hit gaming news yet, but that's okay.

673
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's ask Jessica some more DDR fun stuff.

674
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:37,622
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you get from being a DDR fangirl, I can't pass boom boom dollar the first time, to I am an administrator on DDR Freak?

675
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:38,582
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?

676
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:40,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a bitch.

677
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:48,089
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, it was mostly Jamie's influence that kind of got me into the moderatorship.

678
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all, of course, a part of DDR Freak forums.

679
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:56,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Through my friendship with Jamie, she introduced me to a lot of the Bay Area people.

680
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bay Area people talked with other Bay Area people.

681
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, humorously enough... So you were part of a clique?

682
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, yeah.

683
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:10,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But humorously enough, J-Dog did not want me as a moderator.

684
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:11,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

685
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:38,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Signing actually kind of went behind his back and just boop, here you go So I was given my moderatorship because of Jamie and Inouye The mod that was not meant to be, oh boy And I was introduced to Signing and just kind of became a mod from there And ever since, there was a period of time when J-Dog and I really did not get along at all because of it

686
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:40,556
[SPEAKER_04]: He always felt that I shouldn't have been a mod.

687
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,577
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not ready to be a mod yet.

688
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:47,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we need more people from all over, but I don't think we need another Sacramento person.

689
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there trials you have to go through to become a moderator?

690
00:42:50,282 --> 00:42:53,043
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you just need to be able to follow the rules.

691
00:42:53,564 --> 00:42:54,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a good babysitter.

692
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:57,106
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have to kiss J-Dog or anything?

693
00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:58,767
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

694
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:00,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

695
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:02,069
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no kissing the co.

696
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have a very epic trip to Las Vegas.

697
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and we were stalked.

698
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:08,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

699
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:08,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

700
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:10,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear how she got from moderator to administrator.

701
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is before that, but... Okay, okay.

702
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:15,415
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine, fine.

703
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we'll skip, we'll come back.

704
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:18,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

705
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:26,459
[SPEAKER_04]: As for becoming administrator, it was kind of... I was helping out with a lot of the website stuff.

706
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I was available a lot more than a lot of the people and...

707
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:44,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Spike, who was the administrator at the time, he really was having a hard time keeping up with things and I had become an administrator because of my helping out type of stuff.

708
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:57,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working on some of the web stuff, keeping things handled there, doing the DDR Freak Radio and making sure that certain people stayed banned and what have you.

709
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:24,717
[SPEAKER_04]: and because of all that I got my administratorship and then Spike decided that he just couldn't dedicate enough time anymore and it was basically put to a little mini vote between like the other big wigs and I kind of became head administrator the girls at the Mean Girls head table or whatever so yeah I became the head bitch in charge and that's where I stayed for probably a couple years

710
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,572
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the meanest thing you ever had to do?

711
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:32,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I guess I should say the bitchiest thing you ever had to do as an administrator.

712
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:32,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

713
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:38,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's... Okay, here's another humorous story.

714
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,942
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people remember Pyrofreeze.

715
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:46,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

716
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reaction that most people have when mentioning Pyrofreeze.

717
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:53,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he was a troll-a-da-la-lull.

718
00:44:55,291 --> 00:45:15,485
[SPEAKER_04]: to the extreme and we had to ban him and he would evade the ban and ban him again evade the ban ban him again and this just went on and on and on you know the unfortunate part is that he's very very smart when it comes to you know spoofing IPs and what have you really smart guy and he finally decided he was bored with it

719
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:20,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Left over to DDREI for a while and then just kind of dropped off the face of the planet.

720
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:27,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he came back and he kind of apologized to me for being such a troll for so long.

721
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I grew up, basically?

722
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:34,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically I grew up, I was in my early 20s and I was being a total jackass.

723
00:45:34,713 --> 00:45:42,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started talking and I started letting him stay on the forum a little bit more and...

724
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:48,980
[SPEAKER_04]: and then he and I just kept getting closer and closer as friends and we ended up going to meet up in Las Vegas.

725
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually met one of our biggest trolls in Las Vegas and had a good time.

726
00:45:56,743 --> 00:45:57,443
[SPEAKER_04]: We gambled.

727
00:45:57,483 --> 00:45:58,443
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't sleep with him, did you?

728
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:07,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, oh my god!

729
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:08,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say no.

730
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:09,788
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to say no, just say no.

731
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:10,868
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had a really big dick.

732
00:46:15,777 --> 00:46:17,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say you're complimentary shades.

733
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:36,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, okay!

734
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:39,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they say, Rob.

735
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:43,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

736
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:46,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he was very close.

737
00:46:46,062 --> 00:46:48,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I'm thinking of the enemies I had back in the day.

738
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,625
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

739
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:53,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even close, no.

740
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:54,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Just ew.

741
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:59,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of those situations where we were kind of flirtatious ahead of time and...

742
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:05,592
[SPEAKER_04]: One Thing Led to Another, and yeah, stuff.

743
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:09,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, okay.

744
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:12,179
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not the line of questioning I really... Whatever.

745
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:16,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, when the money runs out when you're gambling, what else is there to do in Vegas?

746
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did come back with a cute story about how we got married.

747
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,853
[SPEAKER_04]: We were married by Elvis and everything.

748
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:26,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

749
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:28,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing came of it, of course.

750
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:30,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just all in good fun.

751
00:47:31,537 --> 00:47:39,382
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my, hey, I'm free from debt, so let me put myself into a tiny bit more to start with again because I just got a new credit card.

752
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:47,908
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is interesting, all joking and laughing and lols aside, it is interesting how people really do kind of grow up and mature and can really change.

753
00:47:47,928 --> 00:47:48,028
[SPEAKER_04]: 100% did.

754
00:47:48,048 --> 00:47:48,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

755
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:52,110
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an awesome guy and I wish him well.

756
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even really talked to him for the past couple of years, but he's a cool guy.

757
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:06,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I remember the truce happening because we started seeing him more and more on the forums and we talked about it too.

758
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:14,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually remember posting something in the moderator forum saying, Hey guys, just back off him.

759
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,085
[SPEAKER_04]: He's trying to be good.

760
00:48:16,005 --> 00:48:16,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

761
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:24,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike other people who have been complete assholes on the forum who got banned and... Dan's raising his hand.

762
00:48:24,173 --> 00:48:26,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sweetie, I know that you're a complete asshole.

763
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the forums.

764
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: He says not on the forums.

765
00:48:32,048 --> 00:48:34,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a certain guy by the name of Jared.

766
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I banned Tran.

767
00:48:40,216 --> 00:48:41,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, Trampawa.

768
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:42,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

769
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:49,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how suddenly it's talked into talking about all the trolls of the DDR Freak Days and which ones of them Jessica has slept with and which ones she hasn't.

770
00:48:49,705 --> 00:48:52,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Kilroy on my friends list on Facebook now, which is kind of humorous.

771
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,809
[SPEAKER_07]: This is funny.

772
00:48:56,511 --> 00:49:02,735
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are a web troll out there, just know if you turn over a new leaf, you might have some surprises in store.

773
00:49:04,657 --> 00:49:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Rob.

774
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:13,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time some damn story about Lolo or something gets brought up on Under Sedation Live, it'll be well-deserved.

775
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have the caveat that this was at least six years ago.

776
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:22,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that would apply to the newt.

777
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:23,742
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

778
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:26,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not go there.

779
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:26,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say it.

780
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:27,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it backwards.

781
00:49:27,904 --> 00:49:28,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

782
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:28,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

783
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:30,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting into gaming news.

784
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:31,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, yes, let's do it.

785
00:49:31,987 --> 00:49:33,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only like an hour into the show.

786
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:34,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't even touched on gaming news yet.

787
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:35,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

788
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, no, it's okay.

789
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, it was great.

790
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:38,790
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

791
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:43,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, put down the I-O-S and let's talk about gaming news.

792
00:49:44,332 --> 00:49:47,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You sure you don't want to talk about enemies that you've slept with or anything?

793
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:50,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I have any.

794
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely not of the online DDR Freak sort.

795
00:49:55,402 --> 00:49:55,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I buried mine.

796
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:58,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I ever had enemies.

797
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:01,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I didn't really post much on DDR Freak.

798
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:02,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, everybody was my enemy.

799
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:04,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the other problem.

800
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:20,630
[SPEAKER_05]: and now they're all close friends kidding so there's a new game from Valve that was announced Defense of the Ancients 2 and apparently it's going to be including all the 100 plus characters

801
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:46,976
[SPEAKER_05]: and I guess that's from the original game and new social features and the game itself of course is kind of an action RTS and honestly I've never played it nor I have heard anything about it but I mean I remember the same thing with Team Fortress 2 it's like Team Fortress 2 what was Team Fortress 1 and well this is interesting then more and more comes out about it and

802
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,858
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's Valve making, I'm sure it's going to be awesome.

803
00:50:50,138 --> 00:50:55,521
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, I'll have to wait until 2011 to actually be able to play the game.

804
00:50:56,182 --> 00:51:01,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sure if they're making a sequel to it, it was probably insanely popular to begin with.

805
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:04,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, Defense of the Ancients was a huge Warcraft 3 thing.

806
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:05,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

807
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:06,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty cool.

808
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:07,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

809
00:51:07,828 --> 00:51:08,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

810
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:16,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of an interesting story because, you know, since Warcraft has kind of gone the way of World of Warcraft, which is not an RTS...

811
00:51:17,393 --> 00:51:21,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically have StarCraft and you have your handful of other RTSs on the PC.

812
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:31,101
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be, especially the fact that A, it's coming from Valve, it's a mod that tons and tons and tons of Warcraft players are very familiar with.

813
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:35,203
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be very interesting to see how that translates into a spin-off game.

814
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:38,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet it'll be very successful the way Team Fortress 2 was.

815
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:39,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.

816
00:51:39,325 --> 00:51:39,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

817
00:51:40,526 --> 00:51:44,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if they bundle it in an uber pack of games like they did, you know, with Team Fortress 2.

818
00:51:44,747 --> 00:51:53,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't even think that's necessary, but just the support that they put towards their games, I mean, look at even Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2 or Team Fortress.

819
00:51:53,890 --> 00:52:01,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just so much damn support after the fact that, you know, they really keep up interest in the game long after it's come out.

820
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:02,433
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX360's GameRooms.com

821
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:25,526
[SPEAKER_07]: is shutting their doors.

822
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,147
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, Chrome Studios.

823
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,508
[SPEAKER_07]: They're located in Australia.

824
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:30,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They are shutting down.

825
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:32,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a done deal, unfortunately.

826
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:37,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, this was sort of something you kind of saw coming because they've been scaling back for a while.

827
00:52:38,174 --> 00:52:40,795
[SPEAKER_07]: They closed some of their studios throughout Australia earlier in the year.

828
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:45,819
[SPEAKER_07]: The remaining staff at the studios in Brisbane and Melbourne have been let go.

829
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:49,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Both studios are closing their doors tomorrow morning, which would be today.

830
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:52,202
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, scale back, way back.

831
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:53,423
[SPEAKER_07]: No, really, all the way back.

832
00:52:54,163 --> 00:52:55,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the future in Australia.

833
00:52:55,744 --> 00:53:01,387
[SPEAKER_07]: The sad thing is that they were Australia's largest development house, and so now they are gone.

834
00:53:02,628 --> 00:53:08,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, there are some lingering questions as to what's going to happen to Game Room, because they were kind of the biggest things behind Game Room.

835
00:53:08,531 --> 00:53:12,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise you, just as many releases on Game Room now as there...

836
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:15,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they'll keep scaling it back to like one game a week.

837
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:20,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it should be said there are still games being released for Game Room.

838
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:20,579
[SPEAKER_07]: There are?

839
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:21,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

840
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they've been pretty good about doing them every week.

841
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:35,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say they're always good games or well-known, but actually, I believe I was looking at what was coming up next week, and let me look.

842
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:36,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick here.

843
00:53:36,332 --> 00:53:38,333
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a list available on Wikipedia.

844
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:42,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if I would say doom and gloom in the end of Game Room just yet, because they still have.

845
00:53:43,214 --> 00:53:48,916
[SPEAKER_07]: For October 13th, Game Pack 10 gets more releases that include Radar Lock.

846
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:49,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, that was this week.

847
00:53:49,816 --> 00:53:50,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

848
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:51,577
[SPEAKER_07]: What was on deck for next week?

849
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:53,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here we go.

850
00:53:54,200 --> 00:54:02,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Breakout on the Atari, Double Dunk on the Atari, and Jackal, the arcade game from Konami, which was a classic game of the week before.

851
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:09,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, they still have some, even though two of those releases are kind of, okay, whatever, you do still have a pretty good memorable title in there.

852
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:17,042
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and that's going to be Game Pack 11, because I think that's the start of a new Game Pack, so I don't think you can say that Game Room's really dead.

853
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:23,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing as the Microsoft logo's on that, it would make sense to me that the assets will get transformed over to Microsoft.

854
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:30,211
[SPEAKER_07]: That might ultimately be a good thing, because maybe Microsoft will give it to someone else and say, here, make this better.

855
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:34,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they will say, we will now write this off.

856
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what's going to happen.

857
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:38,297
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of on life support right now.

858
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:40,159
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

859
00:54:56,575 --> 00:55:02,696
[SPEAKER_07]: One of its other biggest drawbacks is no publishers besides Atari and Television and Konami seem to be on board.

860
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:11,318
[SPEAKER_07]: If they could at least get a couple more publishers or some rights to some other games, even if it's like Commodore 64, computer games, they could really breathe some life back into this thing.

861
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:13,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'll just depend on, do they want to?

862
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:14,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the sales there?

863
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:19,160
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, even if they're only selling like 50 copies of Jackal...

864
00:55:20,106 --> 00:55:20,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

865
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:47,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it's a lot of work, Loki.

866
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:52,215
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take a 20-man team to do, but there is some work involved in it.

867
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not completely free.

868
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:56,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

869
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:06,264
[SPEAKER_07]: and Spazinator PSN in our chatroom at chat.arnstanzradio.com says, Game Room is one of my favorite games on my 360 and Defective Candy says, bah, I loved Game Room.

870
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:11,727
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot I do still like about Game Room, you know, and I'm kind of sad to see that it might be done.

871
00:56:12,148 --> 00:56:19,692
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't, you know, BlackWolf in chat says, even the games, quote, nobody plays has at least 400 people on the leaderboard.

872
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:21,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, 400 times three, $1,200.

873
00:56:21,353 --> 00:56:22,133
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still something.

874
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,601
[SPEAKER_02]: You said he was playing Intellivision Pinball, and that was one of them.

875
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:30,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

876
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:31,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

877
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with Ranma, we need Mercs.

878
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:37,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to some more gaming news, DarkSakura, and we'll see.

879
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:40,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think, I would not put the nail in the coffin of Game Room just yet.

880
00:56:40,806 --> 00:56:44,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be on life support, as Jamie said, but it's not flatlined yet.

881
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:49,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking in terms of games that have...

882
00:56:50,236 --> 00:56:56,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously been on their last legs that may or may not have a forever title attached to it coming out one day.

883
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:58,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not holding my breath for the record.

884
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be this spring.

885
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not holding my breath.

886
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:19,778
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, there is a non-commercial license out to go ahead and make the fan-made Duke Nukem Next Gen that is basically a remake of Duke Nukem 3D using the Unreal Engine.

887
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And I watched some of the film of it and it looks sweet.

888
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem 3D

889
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:32,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say was probably my... You know what?

890
00:57:32,506 --> 00:57:33,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played this before I played Doom.

891
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:35,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

892
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also my first LAN game that I ever played.

893
00:57:39,754 --> 00:57:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you could do the little voice macros in it.

894
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:42,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really great.

895
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:42,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

896
00:57:44,902 --> 00:57:59,173
[SPEAKER_02]: He was also working on next-gen remakes of Daikatana and Sin, but this one was given the green light, so he's going to make a multiplayer demo of it that should be out fairly soon.

897
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:03,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And the full version will be out, he says, when it's done.

898
00:58:05,198 --> 00:58:06,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a code for him.

899
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,882
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually really cool the developers to do.

900
00:58:11,122 --> 00:58:11,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised.

901
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:14,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very surprised that they're not trying to do it themselves.

902
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very surprised that they aren't going to put this on a console.

903
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, an HD remake of Duke Nukem 3D would be fucking awesome.

904
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a little redundant because there's already Duke Nukem 3D.

905
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:26,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares though?

906
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:28,773
[SPEAKER_05]: A little redundant.

907
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:32,475
[SPEAKER_05]: You do all these HD versions of games and that's just making the sprites look prettier.

908
00:58:32,515 --> 00:58:34,116
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually rebuilding the game.

909
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,137
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks gorgeous.

910
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, they definitely kind of rebuilt that first level in there.

911
00:58:39,522 --> 00:58:43,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know this doesn't translate well to radio, but you're kind of seeing... I'm going to link the video in the chat room.

912
00:58:43,284 --> 00:58:47,827
[SPEAKER_07]: You're kind of seeing a remake of that first level where you're on the rooftops and things kind of crash down.

913
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:50,508
[SPEAKER_07]: You sort of see a remake of that here in this engine.

914
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:51,709
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

915
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:54,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And it moves very smoothly.

916
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:56,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Kink's Quest Silver Lining Debacle

917
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:19,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is... I would play this.

918
00:59:19,748 --> 00:59:27,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And normally, first-person games like that, especially ones that are actually 3D models, make me really, really motion sick.

919
00:59:28,112 --> 00:59:28,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still play this.

920
00:59:30,293 --> 00:59:32,534
[SPEAKER_02]: This would probably be like my new portal.

921
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:35,618
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be fun, especially with the multiplayer and everything.

922
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:36,059
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

923
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:45,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things I think we tend to see through the retro-colored glasses, a little play on the rose-colored glasses, retro-colored glasses, because I know when I played Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live, I was like, oh, this is cool.

924
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:47,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was like, oh, but I don't know.

925
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:51,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not the same as it was when I was 18 and in the college dorms.

926
00:59:51,691 --> 00:59:58,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like playing Atari now versus playing Atari when you were first... There's some games that never lose their charm in Atari.

927
00:59:58,596 --> 00:59:58,816
[SPEAKER_07]: To be...

928
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:28,637
[SPEAKER_07]: you make a good point but I don't play it I don't play it as much as I used to when I was a kid but it's still kind of cool to have because like yeah sometimes I'll get bored and I'll just kind of go into game room I'm like oh let me just play Keystone Capers for a minute and then I'm done you know I don't stay up all night playing it like I used to when I was six and we would have you know people you know little sleepovers and whatever but you know it's still kind of cool to have anyhow all right moving on to some more gaming news release dates classic game of the week coming up in a little while as well but first Loki

929
01:00:29,178 --> 01:00:33,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Red Dead Redemption, of course, is getting its new expansion pack.

930
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out October 26th, The Undead Nightmare brings zombies into the wonderful game of Red Dead Redemption.

931
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:54,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all sorts of awesome by itself, but if you happen to, say, want to skip buying Red Dead Redemption and just want to get straight to the zombies, screw all this, you know...

932
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:57,734
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be in stores, I guess It's a couple weeks actually

933
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:22,813
[SPEAKER_05]: for $30.

934
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that's only on Xbox 360, but it may very well be coming to both platforms.

935
01:01:29,238 --> 01:01:31,579
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of right now, I know it's coming to Xbox 360.

936
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:33,901
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's cool.

937
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:36,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Because zombies have to be in everything, right?

938
01:01:36,422 --> 01:01:37,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

939
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:38,484
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a zombie horse.

940
01:01:38,524 --> 01:01:39,765
[SPEAKER_05]: You can fight zombie bears.

941
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:42,254
[SPEAKER_07]: with your zombie guns.

942
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:45,455
[SPEAKER_05]: The guns are not living.

943
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:48,596
[SPEAKER_07]: How well does the whole DLC in stores thing do?

944
01:01:48,656 --> 01:01:51,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you have any insight to that from your distribution perspectives.

945
01:01:51,617 --> 01:01:52,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that actually do well?

946
01:01:53,198 --> 01:01:53,898
[SPEAKER_05]: This is different, though.

947
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:55,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, they do sell.

948
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is separate.

949
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,781
[SPEAKER_05]: You do not need the original game to play this.

950
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:02,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed that.

951
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:02,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

952
01:02:03,161 --> 01:02:07,583
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the online component only to the game.

953
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:07,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

954
01:02:08,403 --> 01:02:12,225
[SPEAKER_05]: You can technically play the free roam offline, but there's no storyline.

955
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:14,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, here's the world, go play.

956
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:16,147
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

957
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:17,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of neat.

958
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:21,069
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice alternative, I guess, to those that maybe don't even want to play the single player.

959
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:24,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you really should play the single player because it's really awesome.

960
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:27,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, that's cool.

961
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:37,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't really been buying any of the download content for Red Dead Redemption, but I may have to check this out because I do like me some zombies.

962
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:40,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Beatmania 2DX Beatmania 2DX Beatmania 2DX

963
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:02,688
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

964
01:03:21,593 --> 01:03:28,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, being that it's been a year and no sign of Beatmania 2DX 17, which came out in arcades some time ago, and now what?

965
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:31,275
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already announced 18 as well, so they're getting ahead.

966
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:45,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Some Japanese fans actually took it up to create a petition saying, hey, we want Beatmania 2DX 17 series to come out for the consoles, either be PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 or what have you.

967
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:50,478
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, that's the problem, though, is they have before it was just take the same engine,

968
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:51,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Add new songs.

969
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:52,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

970
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:53,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Reskin it.

971
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:53,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

972
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:29,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Gay Unicorn Edition Yeah, that sounds like Always I wanna be with you Exactly I'd have to play that actually Yeah, see, see But only that song It has nothing to do with the game No, but

973
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:37,757
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's why I think the problem is right now they don't have a brand new piece of software to work off of.

974
01:04:37,777 --> 01:04:44,865
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have anything made before, so they're trying to create something new in order for it to support B-Mania.

975
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:49,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, they could just upskill stuff that they have, but whatever.

976
01:04:50,091 --> 01:04:59,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, regardless, some Japanese fans decided to get together and start this online petition, which started circulating its way on some of the big American sites like DemaniStyle and some of those as well.

977
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, hey, you need to release this game over here.

978
01:05:02,974 --> 01:05:05,854
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting, though, you might go, oh, yeah, online petitions.

979
01:05:05,975 --> 01:05:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're going to have a lot of luck with those because those always do the trick.

980
01:05:08,855 --> 01:05:11,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless it's Betty White and Saturday Night Live, it's not going to happen.

981
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:12,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

982
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:13,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I was part of that one.

983
01:05:42,524 --> 01:05:44,725
[SPEAKER_07]: And Konami actually responded to this.

984
01:05:45,185 --> 01:05:47,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami has written a little response.

985
01:05:47,326 --> 01:05:51,727
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually used the little Twitter tag thing, CS Serious or whatever.

986
01:05:52,347 --> 01:06:01,010
[SPEAKER_07]: They put, were another 2DX CS game to be released, would you like it to be on PS2, PS3, or another system?

987
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:09,753
[SPEAKER_07]: This might tie in a little bit, too, and I think something that's not really touched on in this particular article I'm looking at, but I remember, on Naoki Midea's Facebook account,

988
01:06:09,853 --> 01:06:14,176
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually was asking, and he does a lot of the stuff in music games, he asked a very similar question.

989
01:06:14,316 --> 01:06:16,838
[SPEAKER_07]: He did like a little survey, like what systems do you play games on?

990
01:06:17,158 --> 01:06:18,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to see games on PS3?

991
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,260
[SPEAKER_07]: What games do you want to see?

992
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:28,226
[SPEAKER_07]: So Konami's kind of exploring this a little bit, and I think, I hope anyway, a lot of people responded to this saying, PS3, PS3, do it, do it, do it.

993
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:30,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great thing.

994
01:06:30,398 --> 01:06:33,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it would be region free because PS3 is region free.

995
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,681
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't even have to worry about having to get a Japanese PlayStation 3.

996
01:06:39,182 --> 01:06:41,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got that pilot controllers in the vault.

997
01:06:41,022 --> 01:06:43,283
[SPEAKER_07]: But not all 360 games are region locked either though.

998
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:52,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Right in our chatroom says, is CS Sirius endorsed by President Cat?

999
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:54,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, President Cat.

1000
01:06:54,149 --> 01:06:54,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

1001
01:06:54,769 --> 01:07:00,472
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember, CS Sirius is coming from Japan and President Cat would be a US thing even though he could be like the world's president.

1002
01:07:00,772 --> 01:07:04,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there would need to be like Ambassador Puppy or something.

1003
01:07:05,315 --> 01:07:06,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And President Cat's a girl.

1004
01:07:07,636 --> 01:07:07,956
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1005
01:07:08,617 --> 01:07:10,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why we didn't get President Cat over here.

1006
01:07:11,078 --> 01:07:16,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And Black Wolf, our pal, is correcting us saying it was 15,000 pre-orders because he was one of them.

1007
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew a couple people that were in on that too.

1008
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:22,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting to see if Konami kind of continues with this.

1009
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they will.

1010
01:07:24,201 --> 01:07:26,022
[SPEAKER_07]: My gut tells me they'll do it.

1011
01:07:26,602 --> 01:07:27,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll be PS3.

1012
01:07:27,402 --> 01:07:29,023
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1013
01:07:30,204 --> 01:07:30,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll probably buy it.

1014
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:34,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll be multi-platform because they're not going to put all their eggs in PS3.

1015
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:37,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if it's Japan only, then yeah, it would be PS3.

1016
01:07:37,688 --> 01:07:43,230
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it does come out over here, it'll be multi-platform because PS3 sales over here aren't.

1017
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they'll bother with it.

1018
01:07:44,871 --> 01:07:52,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what they're going to do is do it on PS3 for wide release in Japan and do a limited release on PS3 in the United States.

1019
01:07:53,056 --> 01:07:53,777
[SPEAKER_07]: That would make sense.

1020
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:55,618
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I see happening.

1021
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:59,580
[SPEAKER_02]: How many copies did they make of Beatmania when they brought it out over here?

1022
01:08:00,621 --> 01:08:02,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Beatmania 2DX still use licensed music?

1023
01:08:03,022 --> 01:08:05,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more about the controllers would be the biggest pain in the butt.

1024
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got controllers.

1025
01:08:09,046 --> 01:08:11,908
[SPEAKER_02]: If they used the redone model for the controllers they really were a lot better.

1026
01:08:12,768 --> 01:08:15,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but now it's all USB on the PS3.

1027
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:21,554
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a converter, which either way you're looking at some type of peripheral to come with you.

1028
01:08:21,574 --> 01:08:23,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they could rework the controller.

1029
01:08:24,336 --> 01:08:25,797
[SPEAKER_02]: They make them.

1030
01:08:25,938 --> 01:08:31,381
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also those multi-converter things so you can use other controllers on different systems.

1031
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:34,163
[SPEAKER_05]: If they haven't been locked out by Sony.

1032
01:08:34,263 --> 01:08:35,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just use your guitar.

1033
01:08:35,384 --> 01:08:36,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Just play 2DX on your guitar.

1034
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:37,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Freaks.

1035
01:08:38,006 --> 01:08:38,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, not guitar freaks.

1036
01:08:38,927 --> 01:08:39,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar hero.

1037
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:40,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar or whatever.

1038
01:08:40,768 --> 01:08:42,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Sitar Hero Sitar Hero

1039
01:09:10,782 --> 01:09:18,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock sold 86,000 copies its first week in the US on all formats.

1040
01:09:21,027 --> 01:09:22,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here's the numbers for the other ones.

1041
01:09:23,428 --> 01:09:23,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1042
01:09:24,188 --> 01:09:27,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 units.

1043
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:30,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that overall or in its first week?

1044
01:09:31,009 --> 01:09:31,449
[SPEAKER_02]: First week.

1045
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1046
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:34,990
[SPEAKER_02]: These are first months that I'm going through now.

1047
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,631
[SPEAKER_02]: This was just the first week, the 86,000.

1048
01:09:36,931 --> 01:09:37,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1049
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:40,352
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of these are going to be... Okay.

1050
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:42,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 its first month in 2009.

1051
01:09:42,872 --> 01:09:42,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1052
01:09:46,773 --> 01:09:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero World Tour sold 50,000 in its first week in 2008.

1053
01:09:51,137 --> 01:09:56,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And Guitar Hero 3 sold 1.4 million units in five days.

1054
01:09:57,182 --> 01:09:59,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, these are also going back in time.

1055
01:09:59,964 --> 01:10:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking 499,000 units in a month for Guitar Hero 5 in 2009.

1056
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2008, and before that in 2007.

1057
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:03,947
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about in its first month?

1058
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:04,628
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1059
01:10:04,668 --> 01:10:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Its first week.

1060
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:19,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero 5 was in its first month.

1061
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:25,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It sold just under as many units as Guitar Hero World Tour did in a week.

1062
01:10:26,945 --> 01:10:27,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

1063
01:10:27,905 --> 01:10:28,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1064
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:28,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1065
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:33,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of these games tend to sell in the first few weeks.

1066
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:40,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, couldn't you argue that Guitar Hero is going to have some lasting power through the holidays because it's a game that Grandma might buy the kids?

1067
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:42,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know so much.

1068
01:10:42,728 --> 01:10:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, if it was going to draw in the business, the numbers would have stayed steady, I think.

1069
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:57,149
[SPEAKER_05]: No one cared about Guitar Hero this year, and the reason why is because they... No, not really, because a lot of people don't care about Rock Band 3 either.

1070
01:10:57,309 --> 01:11:01,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, they kind of have the mentality, oh, when music games are dead, genre is dead.

1071
01:11:01,849 --> 01:11:02,250
[SPEAKER_05]: They're dumb.

1072
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:13,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, going to say that, Harmonix actually had to convince people that the whole genre wasn't declining, so...

1073
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:20,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the CEO was saying, and I quote, I absolutely do not believe that rhythm action gaming has reached its peak.

1074
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:31,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But, eh, they're saying in the UK that Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock launched at 6 on the list and rated a 7 out of 10.

1075
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:33,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

1076
01:11:33,645 --> 01:11:36,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Guitar Hero's just getting stale to a lot of people.

1077
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what did this new game bring to the table?

1078
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:42,131
[SPEAKER_05]: They brought transforming characters.

1079
01:11:43,444 --> 01:12:01,825
[SPEAKER_05]: We get a guitar and rock hand Here's why Guitar Hero 5 sold more than Guitar Hero Warriors Rock Guitar Hero 5 for the first month included Guitar Hero Van Halen for free The new Guitar Hero included a Soundgarden album

1080
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a crap about the Soundgarden album?

1081
01:12:09,803 --> 01:12:19,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Van Hagar fan, so I would have picked Soundgarden over... But it was a game that people would be able to get their hands on months before it was released.

1082
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:21,688
[SPEAKER_07]: A $12 CD versus a $40 game, I get it.

1083
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:22,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But keep in mind... $60 game.

1084
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:24,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

1085
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:25,410
[SPEAKER_05]: They charge full price.

1086
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

1087
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:27,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Assholes.

1088
01:12:27,471 --> 01:12:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as many copies sold in a week a year before and it didn't have a pack in a bonus game.

1089
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:39,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Might I remind everybody once again and I can't say Activision is the only culprit for this but

1090
01:12:40,698 --> 01:12:55,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii versions of Guitar Hero, and Wii versions of Rock Band, and Wii versions of DJ Hero, and the Wii versions of the Tony Hawk Shred game that's coming out, all $60 retail.

1091
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1092
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:00,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite the fact that most Wii games top out at $50.

1093
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:03,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Their excuse, oh, we need more money for music licensing.

1094
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:07,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait, why is Tony Hawk more expensive than that?

1095
01:13:09,637 --> 01:13:11,079
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to pay the Deftones more money.

1096
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:13,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Because no one's going to buy it anyway, so whatever.

1097
01:13:14,643 --> 01:13:13,401
$1,000,000.

1098
01:13:14,743 --> 01:13:16,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby makes a good point in our chat room.

1099
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:22,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackwolf in chat.orangesoundtrader.com, live here on this Sunday night, says, Yeah, hey, music games are an oversaturated genre.

1100
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:25,515
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a total of four music games that came out this year.

1101
01:13:25,995 --> 01:13:27,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And how many first-person shooters?

1102
01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:28,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

1103
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Or sports games, or, you know, just saying.

1104
01:13:33,593 --> 01:13:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what it's going to come down, we'll have to see how Rock Band 3 does, because it's not, I mean, you can't really go off of Green Day Rock Band, because I knew that was going to be terrible when it first came out, or when it was first announced.

1105
01:13:45,589 --> 01:14:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Beatles rock band was awesome but both are niche even though the Beatles is like a big niche and Green Day is a smaller niche they're both a little too they're niche and that limits the audience I think Rock Band 3 is going to be pretty incredible but I don't think it's going to be as big of a jump as Rock Band 1 to Rock Band 2 because a lot of people are like why do I need the upgrade because I have all these thousands of songs already with download content do I really need 80 songs

1106
01:14:14,893 --> 01:14:15,754
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1107
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:43,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero, the new things it brought to the table were almost all single player things.

1108
01:14:44,552 --> 01:14:48,194
[SPEAKER_07]: But Rock Band 3 is bringing more things to the multiplayer experience.

1109
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:50,175
[SPEAKER_07]: A fast story mode.

1110
01:14:50,676 --> 01:14:51,916
[SPEAKER_07]: A new keyboard.

1111
01:14:52,737 --> 01:14:55,218
[SPEAKER_07]: These new ways of dropping in and out really quick.

1112
01:14:55,318 --> 01:14:57,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything it's bringing to the table is for the party.

1113
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And a new pro mode type thing.

1114
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people may be interested in that.

1115
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:04,244
[SPEAKER_05]: With at least the drums and the keyboards that Mike...

1116
01:15:04,744 --> 01:15:05,405
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1117
01:15:21,745 --> 01:15:23,226
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in our chatroom has a good point.

1118
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:27,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band 3 is going to raise the bar because of its peripherals can be used as real instruments.

1119
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:30,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero will soon follow with their own version.

1120
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:31,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a darn good point.

1121
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:32,212
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't even address that.

1122
01:15:33,012 --> 01:15:38,496
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that Rock Band has that Guitar Hero is not going to have is this whole learn to actually play or the pro mode.

1123
01:15:39,116 --> 01:15:40,177
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1124
01:15:56,733 --> 01:15:57,353
[SPEAKER_07]: for these songs.

1125
01:15:57,393 --> 01:15:57,994
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1126
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:00,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone like Bobby could probably appreciate this.

1127
01:16:00,535 --> 01:16:08,898
[SPEAKER_05]: They also have the MIDI controller that you can buy for your MIDI-enabled instruments and just drop that in straight to the game.

1128
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:10,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't he have a full MIDI drum set?

1129
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:11,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe he does.

1130
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And probably a keyboard.

1131
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,981
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a huge drummer guy.

1132
01:16:16,381 --> 01:16:18,142
[SPEAKER_07]: He makes money off some of that stuff, so I imagine he does.

1133
01:16:18,182 --> 01:16:19,243
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll say in chat in a minute, I'm sure.

1134
01:16:20,765 --> 01:16:21,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

1135
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:25,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go travel around the world and take a look at some release dates and things coming to a store near you.

1136
01:16:38,357 --> 01:16:40,258
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Hero 2 is coming out this week.

1137
01:16:40,278 --> 01:16:42,118
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be on all three major systems.

1138
01:16:43,218 --> 01:16:47,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll have to wait until the 3DS version comes out for the portable DJ Hero.

1139
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

1140
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:16,514
[SPEAKER_05]: and then of course they're going to be re-releasing the first DJ Hero game in case you want to buy the standalone thing and then they have the bundles with the controllers the bundles with two controllers and a microphone because you need two turntables and a microphone so

1141
01:17:18,636 --> 01:17:19,537
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all fun stuff.

1142
01:17:20,657 --> 01:17:26,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Other slightly more boring stuff, Salter Overload Plus, delayed from last week, still hasn't come out, still don't care.

1143
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:30,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirby's Epic Yarn, that came out today, so that's pretty exciting.

1144
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:37,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmtopia on the DS.

[SPEAKER_05]: No, I thought that was coming out only on the PlayStation Network here.

1292
01:26:58,891 --> 01:27:01,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, because they are releasing it as a title on the PlayStation 3.

1293
01:27:01,712 --> 01:27:06,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a move game where it looks like you kind of draw and little patterns sort of come out.

1294
01:27:06,536 --> 01:27:09,177
[SPEAKER_07]: You sketch the different PlayStation shapes or whatever.

1295
01:27:09,518 --> 01:27:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm assuming it kind of makes music.

1296
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:14,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see this lovely little girl here drawing flowers.

1297
01:27:15,462 --> 01:27:18,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm assuming it's music because you see a little counter in the corner.

1298
01:27:18,023 --> 01:27:19,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like it might be kind of neat.

1299
01:27:19,324 --> 01:27:20,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks kind of fun.

1300
01:27:20,165 --> 01:27:23,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine though playing like Oendon with something like that?

1301
01:27:24,387 --> 01:27:26,268
[SPEAKER_02]: If they ever brought Oendon out on the Wii.

1302
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:29,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a music game you'd like to see on PlayStation Move?

1303
01:27:30,091 --> 01:27:31,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Space Channel 5.

1304
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:31,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to lie.

1305
01:27:31,912 --> 01:27:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fantastic.

1306
01:27:34,393 --> 01:27:38,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to think whether... It has to have a special controller that looks like Ulala's mic.

1307
01:27:38,536 --> 01:27:44,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you know, here's a preview here real quick in studio for this beat sketch.

1308
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll post this YouTube to our chat room as well.

1309
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:54,845
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Mario Paint, but happier or something.

1310
01:27:54,865 --> 01:28:03,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1311
01:28:03,297 --> 01:28:04,458
[SPEAKER_07]: People are drawing on the screen.

1312
01:28:07,943 --> 01:28:09,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Some really intricate artwork, though.

1313
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, interesting.

1314
01:28:16,263 --> 01:28:16,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

1315
01:28:16,884 --> 01:28:18,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks like it could be neat.

1316
01:28:18,145 --> 01:28:19,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to post that on YouTube.

1317
01:28:19,126 --> 01:28:20,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a clever little commercial.

1318
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:21,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really say much about the game.

1319
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:27,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if you want to see that YouTube, we were just playing Famitsu Tube is the link there.

1320
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:30,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that must be part of Famitsu Magazine.

1321
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:30,537
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1322
01:28:31,207 --> 01:28:41,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say there is the new Dance Dance Revolution game that will be coming out that actually utilizes the PlayStation Move to do all sorts of weird para type stuff.

1323
01:28:41,296 --> 01:28:42,277
[SPEAKER_05]: This week here in the U.S.

1324
01:28:42,357 --> 01:28:43,418
[SPEAKER_05]: or is that soon?

1325
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:44,979
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's next month.

1326
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,040
[SPEAKER_05]: About a month from now.

1327
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:47,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1328
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:48,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just hook up the pink biscuits.

1329
01:28:49,343 --> 01:28:52,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the Japanese release dates on the Nintendo Wii.

1330
01:28:53,425 --> 01:28:57,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Mina de Bukken, Family Trainer, comes out this week in Japan.

1331
01:28:57,369 --> 01:28:58,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what this game is.

1332
01:28:59,211 --> 01:29:05,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sports game of some sort, but it looks like cute little Indiana Jones-y family characters.

1333
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:08,499
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, even on the cover, they have a family dressed up as Indiana Jones.

1334
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a newer version of the Power Pad that two people use at once, is what it looks like.

1335
01:29:14,945 --> 01:29:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1336
01:29:34,046 --> 01:29:47,711
[SPEAKER_07]: No More Heroes 2 Desperate Struggle comes out this week in Japan and the Super Mario Collection Special Pack which we've talked about earlier on the show the whole if you want to pay a lot of money for an old Super Mario All-Stars game that they could have brought their virtual console because they don't release anything on virtual console anymore are you done?

[SPEAKER_07]: on the Nintendo DS Strike Witches 2 Yasu Nasu Puni Puni Suru comes out this week on the Nintendo DS what game is that?

01:31:12,102 --> 01:31:12,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And no more mic cord.

1353
01:31:14,384 --> 01:31:15,344
Did it cut out again?

1354
01:31:16,325 --> 01:31:17,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have dead air right now.

1355
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:19,487
[SPEAKER_07]: You alright?

1356
01:31:20,348 --> 01:31:21,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have dead air now?

1357
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:21,649
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're good.

1358
01:31:21,869 --> 01:31:23,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do you want me to read my list again?

1359
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:27,593
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, we just didn't get the Vanquish, Vanquish and more Vanquish part that you said.

[SPEAKER_02]: Deathspank Deathspank

1362
01:31:50,555 --> 01:31:52,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadface, Wyndon is awesome.

1363
01:31:52,378 --> 01:32:01,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that, because I think that the new Dance Dance Revolution game has some fruity little mode in it that's, you know, with the stupid move controllers and...

1364
01:32:03,058 --> 01:32:06,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I can't take Konami seriously anymore with their dancing games.

1365
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:11,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just with Dance Master, you're going to really look... You can learn how to dance with this game.

1366
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're going to look like a fool if you try to do what they do in that game in real life.

1367
01:32:16,081 --> 01:32:18,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But Parapara was awesome because you looked like a fool.

1368
01:32:18,702 --> 01:32:19,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I right?

1369
01:32:19,162 --> 01:32:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.

1370
01:32:20,023 --> 01:32:21,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica, didn't you love the Parapara?

1371
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,767
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1372
01:32:45,345 --> 01:32:45,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

1373
01:32:46,506 --> 01:32:47,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not taking it seriously.

1374
01:32:47,746 --> 01:32:51,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going, hey, this is an awesome new dance franchise from Konami.

1375
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:56,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see this as, oh my god, this pile of shit is going to be stinking up my room.

1376
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:59,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to check it out for the sake of the show.

1377
01:32:59,452 --> 01:33:00,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking one for the team, if you will.

1378
01:33:02,734 --> 01:33:04,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1379
01:33:04,755 --> 01:33:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: The Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.

1380
01:33:07,526 --> 01:33:15,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, with Halloween right around the corner, apparently Sony is allowing you to download some free movies.

1381
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:20,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check out some free midnight movie rentals on your PlayStation 3.

1382
01:33:20,352 --> 01:33:24,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They are available for a very select period of time.

1383
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:27,696
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, this weekend they had Bram Stoker's Dracula.

1384
01:33:28,096 --> 01:33:29,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That was available from 5 p.m.

1385
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: on the 16th through 3 a.m.

1386
01:33:31,478 --> 01:33:31,678
[SPEAKER_05]: on the 17th.

1387
01:33:32,618 --> 01:33:36,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, they're going to have Savage County, same time frame, 5 p.m.

1388
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,741
[SPEAKER_05]: on October 23rd to 3 a.m.

1389
01:33:38,841 --> 01:33:40,201
[SPEAKER_05]: on October 24th.

1390
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:45,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, of course, Nightmare on Elm Street, the original one.

1391
01:33:46,464 --> 01:33:51,505
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be available on Halloween from 5 p.m.

1392
01:33:51,786 --> 01:33:53,906
[SPEAKER_05]: on October 30th to 3 a.m.

1393
01:33:54,046 --> 01:33:54,667
[SPEAKER_05]: on October 31st.

1394
01:33:55,902 --> 01:33:56,563
[SPEAKER_05]: What is she doing nowadays?

1395
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:56,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she needs...

1396
01:34:25,524 --> 01:34:26,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that would be awesome.

1397
01:34:26,805 --> 01:34:29,465
[SPEAKER_05]: They should have some sort of hosted stuff.

1398
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:31,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, I could actually tell you.

1399
01:34:31,906 --> 01:34:36,368
[SPEAKER_07]: She's in a new movie called All About Evil, but she's actually Cassandra Peterson.

1400
01:34:36,448 --> 01:34:42,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Her normal self is in this movie All About Evil that's directed by Peaches Christ, who is a drag queen in San Francisco.

1401
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:46,452
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a... Al and I kind of want to go see it.

1402
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:47,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of something cool.

1403
01:34:47,712 --> 01:34:51,453
[SPEAKER_05]: They should do that, though, for like, say, instead of this...

1404
01:34:53,414 --> 01:34:54,615
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

1405
01:34:54,795 --> 01:34:56,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, download a movie for free.

1406
01:34:56,577 --> 01:34:58,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a little work into it to make it awesome.

1407
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:01,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not necessarily that, but actually have it where you can watch a movie.

1408
01:35:01,942 --> 01:35:03,884
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they have it where you can watch a movie with friends and stuff?

1409
01:35:03,904 --> 01:35:05,065
[SPEAKER_05]: But do it like 1 vs. 100.

1410
01:35:05,265 --> 01:35:07,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a theater full of people.

1411
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:09,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Have it hosted by Elvira or something like that.

1412
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:12,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Mystery science theater type of thing or riff tracks.

1413
01:35:12,152 --> 01:35:14,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The last Elvira experience I had was playing pinball.

1414
01:35:15,995 --> 01:35:18,997
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you can even chat to friends and stuff like that.

1415
01:35:19,117 --> 01:35:19,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1416
01:35:20,258 --> 01:35:23,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Or here is a novel concept, Sony.

1417
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:28,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give you some consulting advice for free.

1418
01:35:28,564 --> 01:35:33,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is how to just make people interested in shit they were never interested in before on Sony.

1419
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:36,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it all in Sony Home.

1420
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:52,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Play the movie in the theater on Sony Home and everybody could actually be in the theater and you could have a live host up on the stage being a dork and doing the whole riff tracks thing and it's something new and kind of cool.

1421
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pay Orange Lounge $5,000 for the idea.

1422
01:35:58,063 --> 01:35:59,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave that to Sony for free.

1423
01:36:00,124 --> 01:36:01,925
[SPEAKER_07]: But we wanted money anyway.

1424
01:36:04,506 --> 01:36:06,567
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put me in Sony Home for that free advice.

1425
01:36:06,587 --> 01:36:06,927
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1426
01:36:07,873 --> 01:36:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, I'm surprised that they haven't done something like that Rocky Horror Picture Show with, you know... Rob can have no neck.

1427
01:36:12,996 --> 01:36:16,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee in the chatroom says, throw virtual popcorn at the screen.

1428
01:36:17,139 --> 01:36:18,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing idea.

1429
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:23,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Your avatars could... Yeah.

1430
01:36:23,563 --> 01:36:25,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to picture the time warp.

1431
01:36:27,286 --> 01:36:33,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I could just see some total asshats, though, that would just sit there the whole time flailing around on their move and just popcorns flying everywhere.

1432
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:35,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The entire movie.

1433
01:36:36,195 --> 01:36:36,836
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1434
01:36:36,856 --> 01:36:40,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But, like, you get points for hitting your props at the right cue.

1435
01:36:41,246 --> 01:36:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you press A for, you know, squirt gun.

1436
01:36:45,369 --> 01:36:47,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, going to some comments from the chatroom.

1437
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:52,771
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw was saying Elvira needs her own video game and he actually did follow up saying, you know what, there really was an Elvira game.

1438
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's the same one he linked.

1439
01:36:54,072 --> 01:37:00,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even going to look because I do remember an older PC game and I think there was even one on like the Commodore 64, like really that old.

1440
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:06,056
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was an Elvira video game that was kind of like an adventure game and it actually had like, there was like gore in it and stuff.

1441
01:37:06,096 --> 01:37:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very kind of like, from what I remember, it was a very kind of gory-ish game.

1442
01:37:09,097 --> 01:37:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is it.

1443
01:37:10,878 --> 01:37:14,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Telltale Games, we have a new franchise for you.

1444
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's very cool.

1445
01:37:16,321 --> 01:37:17,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that idea.

1446
01:37:17,682 --> 01:37:24,187
[SPEAKER_07]: There were, I think, three Elvira pinball tables.

1447
01:37:24,787 --> 01:37:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: There were three, I believe, Elvira pinball tables.

1448
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:34,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Defective Candy in our chatroom says, that virtual popcorn idea they use in Gaia Online and they are total asshats at it.

1449
01:37:34,814 --> 01:37:35,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I used to play Gaia.

1450
01:37:36,536 --> 01:37:36,556
I

1451
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:41,180
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually... Okay.

1452
01:37:42,061 --> 01:37:42,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to play Gaia.

1453
01:37:43,142 --> 01:37:44,182
[SPEAKER_02]: My account is still active.

1454
01:37:44,322 --> 01:37:47,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you can go buy stuff from the little vendor to throw at the screen.

1455
01:37:48,385 --> 01:37:48,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1456
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:53,608
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, would you host a Rocky Horror Night in home or in the OLR house?

1457
01:37:54,089 --> 01:37:54,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1458
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony, call me or whatever.

1459
01:37:58,772 --> 01:37:59,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

1460
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1461
01:38:00,113 --> 01:38:04,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I will whore myself out for the sake of publicizing this show and the All Games Network, of course.

1462
01:38:05,676 --> 01:38:08,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I would even do it for free the first time.

1463
01:38:08,098 --> 01:38:08,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1464
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:11,702
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a freebie the first time.

1465
01:38:11,722 --> 01:38:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of the time you have to pay for his whore mouth.

1466
01:38:13,844 --> 01:38:18,268
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1467
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:20,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyhow.

1468
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:24,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a cool idea that hopefully will get cooler.

1469
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:30,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's talk about something that... Okay, your boyfriend gets kudos for me.

1470
01:38:30,376 --> 01:38:30,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Why, what'd he do?

1471
01:38:31,217 --> 01:38:33,579
[SPEAKER_02]: For saying that Scared Stiff was the best of the Elvira table.

1472
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:34,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he loves the Elvira pinball game.

1473
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:35,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so great.

1474
01:38:36,141 --> 01:38:37,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, there's several of them.

1475
01:38:37,903 --> 01:38:38,283
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three.

1476
01:38:39,024 --> 01:38:45,089
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another one that had a two-layer playfield that was really cool.

1477
01:38:45,209 --> 01:38:45,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1478
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what Pinball FX 2 needs?

1479
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Elvira table.

1480
01:38:49,112 --> 01:38:49,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Elvira table.

1481
01:38:50,782 --> 01:38:52,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only problem with Elvira is she's getting kind of old.

1482
01:38:53,563 --> 01:38:54,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Elvira.

1483
01:38:56,165 --> 01:38:57,546
[SPEAKER_07]: That Elvira is probably dead.

1484
01:39:05,928 --> 01:39:10,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how we're all laughing at this and poor Loki's looking at us like, you people are weird.

1485
01:39:10,792 --> 01:39:16,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, with the magic of technology now, we can have old Elvira and new Elvira.

1486
01:39:16,157 --> 01:39:28,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know if you know, but they actually did a reality show on SyFy Network that was The Next Elvira, where they were trying to cast the next Elvira, and some girl won, but they didn't do anything with it.

1487
01:39:29,068 --> 01:39:29,549
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still...

1488
01:39:30,109 --> 01:39:58,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Old Elvira Sorry you loser, there is no replacement for Elvira Thank you for trying As long as there's plastic surgery and makeup we'll always have our Elvira That's right Okay, let me move on here to Blizzard and some stuff going on at Blizzard and StarCraft 2, this isn't about WoW although I will say, the Cataclysm cinematic is now online and it had its little preview during the NFL game tonight and the full one is online and it is epic epicness If you are a WoW player

1489
01:39:58,999 --> 01:40:02,501
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to see the Thousand Needles being flooded.

1490
01:40:02,801 --> 01:40:06,902
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to see Deathwing landing on Stormwind and putting his claws into the castle.

1491
01:40:07,183 --> 01:40:14,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get to see Ashenvale and any Alliance player will love this because you get to see Ashenvale get just destroyed.

1492
01:40:14,646 --> 01:40:15,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, not Ashenvale, Aberdeen.

1493
01:40:16,146 --> 01:40:17,447
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to see Aberdeen get destroyed.

1494
01:40:17,567 --> 01:40:18,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a bad WoW player, sorry.

1495
01:40:18,928 --> 01:40:20,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Aberdeen just gets destroyed in the trailer.

1496
01:40:20,468 --> 01:40:20,768
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1497
01:40:20,968 --> 01:40:22,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that where they keep cows?

1498
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:24,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Aberdeen?

1499
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:26,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you always have to beat up the cows?

1500
01:40:27,071 --> 01:40:28,213
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wasn't beating up the cows.

1501
01:40:28,233 --> 01:40:29,695
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, there are no cows in Aberdeen.

1502
01:40:29,735 --> 01:40:30,196
[SPEAKER_07]: She's crazy.

1503
01:40:30,697 --> 01:40:32,980
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's where the Angus cows come from.

1504
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:34,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the game.

1505
01:40:35,464 --> 01:40:37,467
[SPEAKER_07]: All the cows are in Elwynn Forest.

1506
01:40:37,487 --> 01:40:40,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this spelled like actual Aberdeen?

1507
01:40:40,192 --> 01:40:41,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Forest cows?

1508
01:40:41,053 --> 01:40:42,054
[SPEAKER_07]: That's ridiculous.

1509
01:40:43,809 --> 01:40:44,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a video game, people.

1510
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1511
01:40:46,812 --> 01:40:48,813
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kept making me think of Scotland.

1512
01:40:49,034 --> 01:40:49,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1513
01:40:49,534 --> 01:40:52,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me move on to StarCraft 2 news because that's what this is really about.

1514
01:40:52,457 --> 01:40:53,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about StarCraft 2.

1515
01:40:53,778 --> 01:40:56,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard is actually going to be suing the cheat makers.

1516
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:02,085
[SPEAKER_07]: 5,000 people were busted previously by Blizzard for cheating in StarCraft 2.

1517
01:41:03,106 --> 01:41:06,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Blizzard is actually going to take the people who made the cheats to court.

1518
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:09,592
[SPEAKER_07]: They are taking three men to court for making those hacks.

1519
01:41:12,094 --> 01:41:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Just days after the release of Starcraft 2, defendants already had developed, marketed, and distributed to the public a variety of hacks and cheats designed to modify and in fact destroy the Starcraft 2 online gaming experience, says this lawsuit.

1520
01:41:25,706 --> 01:41:34,694
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, on the very day that Starcraft 2 was released, representatives of the hack's website advised members of the public that our staff is already planning on new releases for the game.

1521
01:41:35,234 --> 01:41:39,961
[SPEAKER_07]: The accused are being accused of multiple counts of copyright infringement.

1522
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:45,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard wants damages and a cut of the money that the three received from selling the hacks.

1523
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:48,373
[SPEAKER_07]: That was your problem.

1524
01:41:48,713 --> 01:41:50,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of these people are from Canada.

1525
01:41:50,636 --> 01:41:51,757
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is from Peru.

1526
01:41:52,398 --> 01:42:12,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Blame Peru It doesn't have the same ring to it It doesn't have the same ring to it, I'm sorry to say that So we'll see what happens with this Probably be a settlement and these guys will get sued to oblivion, we'll see Although the international part of it makes it very interesting Blizzard is also warning people who want to cheat with StarCraft Use these trainers at your own risk

1527
01:42:13,915 --> 01:42:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: This is because Blizzard suspended some accounts because some folks have been exploiting.

1528
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:26,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a guy on this website, Cheat Happens, that was reporting that they were banned from using a trainer in single player.

1529
01:42:27,108 --> 01:42:28,549
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I have a problem with that.

1530
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:31,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you want to cheat in a single player game, who are you hurting?

1531
01:42:32,392 --> 01:42:33,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

1532
01:42:33,133 --> 01:42:35,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard did want to clarify on what's going on here.

1533
01:42:35,695 --> 01:42:40,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard Entertainment is not banning StarCraft 2 players just for using single-player cheats.

1534
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:47,424
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been some confusion in the last couple days about the suspensions and bans meted out to players caught cheating in StarCraft 2.

1535
01:42:48,024 --> 01:42:55,788
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important to point out first that many of the third-party hacks and cheats developed for Starcraft 2 contain both single and multiplayer functionality.

1536
01:42:56,148 --> 01:43:04,572
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to protect the integrity of multiplayer competition, we are actively detecting cheat programs used in multiplayer modes, whether they are human opponents or not.

1537
01:43:05,052 --> 01:43:10,135
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, players who opt to use any type of third-party hacks do so at their own risk.

1538
01:43:10,555 --> 01:43:14,797
[SPEAKER_07]: There are built-in cheat codes for Starcraft 2 single-player that can be used safely.

1539
01:43:15,217 --> 01:43:20,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard has always taken cheating seriously and will continue to aggressively crack down on players who cheat in our games.

1540
01:43:20,579 --> 01:43:38,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, Blizzard also has an achievement system that even works in single player and I imagine these cheat codes disable those and they probably don't like the idea of these other exploits making the achievements easier to get because it gives the wrong perception as to what kind of skills someone has on StarCraft.

1541
01:43:39,956 --> 01:43:40,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to keep in mind.

1542
01:43:41,077 --> 01:43:46,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So after hearing that, does that change your mind, Loki, that Blizzard doesn't really want to ban the single-player cheaters?

1543
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:49,500
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the fact that most of them are multiplayers as well?

1544
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,141
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll find ways around it.

1545
01:43:53,462 --> 01:43:55,022
[SPEAKER_07]: They always do one way or another, don't they?

1546
01:43:56,023 --> 01:43:56,303
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1547
01:43:56,943 --> 01:44:05,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a trip down memory lane to another time when folks weren't banned en masse by cheating on video games and talk about the classic video game of the week.

1548
01:44:09,437 --> 01:44:20,602
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is going to take a stroll to the vault and pull out an old dusty moldy video game that she says, hey, you brats, you need to respect this video game or die.

1549
01:44:21,682 --> 01:44:23,003
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1550
01:44:23,308 --> 01:44:32,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The game of the week is Ikari Warriors, which was also known as Ikari in Japan, which means furious.

1551
01:44:33,275 --> 01:44:35,776
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very, very cool.

1552
01:44:35,796 --> 01:44:46,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It used rotary joysticks and had a two-player mode, and it has Ralph and Clark that later showed up in the King of Fighters series, which we know Ralph and Clark, don't we?

1553
01:44:49,018 --> 01:44:52,219
[SPEAKER_02]: They also make an appearance in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7.

1554
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:59,362
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, you are Ralph and Clark, these commando dudes, and they're trying to reach the village of Ikari.

1555
01:45:00,422 --> 01:45:08,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you get attacked with tanks and soldiers and helicopters, but you get power-ups on the way.

1556
01:45:08,985 --> 01:45:13,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Because power-ups really do show up in real life when you're trying to charge the village of Furious.

1557
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:26,477
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, this was one of the first major games, like I said, to use a rotary joystick, which, like I said, you can rotate as well as push in the different directions.

1558
01:45:27,538 --> 01:45:33,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And your buttons, one of them was your gun, and the other one was for throwing grenades, so you could blow them up.

1559
01:45:34,222 --> 01:45:40,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also was fully cooperative, one of the early games to do that, and had vehicles in it.

1560
01:45:42,012 --> 01:45:48,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually did an SNK pinout and they did a JAMA pinout.

1561
01:45:49,078 --> 01:46:00,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So for people with the arcade SNK machines, it worked in those.

1562
01:46:00,767 --> 01:46:01,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty cool.

1563
01:46:03,048 --> 01:46:06,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really cool.

1564
01:46:07,052 --> 01:46:08,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It had different...

1565
01:46:10,132 --> 01:46:11,073
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1566
01:46:39,025 --> 01:46:41,747
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a DOS version that came out.

1567
01:46:43,028 --> 01:46:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were sequels.

1568
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:50,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Victory Road, also in 1986, in Ikari 3, The Rescue.

1569
01:46:51,513 --> 01:47:03,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was also a Guerrilla War arcane called Guevara in Japan that used a similar type of gameplay that featured Che Guevara and Fidel Castro as the main guys.

1570
01:47:05,121 --> 01:47:16,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But as for the other versions that came out, there was the NES version, Apple II, DOS, Atari ST, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Armstrong CPC.

1571
01:47:17,377 --> 01:47:19,721
[SPEAKER_05]: The NES version was so glitched out.

1572
01:47:19,841 --> 01:47:20,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1573
01:47:20,582 --> 01:47:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But ABBA was a code.

1574
01:47:24,368 --> 01:47:25,509
[SPEAKER_07]: That made the game awesome.

1575
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:31,215
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an MSX version of it and different 16-bit versions that came out.

1576
01:47:31,235 --> 01:47:36,320
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually two different Commodore 64 version ROBs.

1577
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:40,243
[SPEAKER_02]: One was put out by Data East and the other one was by Elite.

1578
01:47:40,624 --> 01:47:42,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, because I only remember one of them.

1579
01:47:42,345 --> 01:47:42,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one of them.

1580
01:47:44,935 --> 01:47:45,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember this game.

1581
01:47:46,756 --> 01:47:51,920
[SPEAKER_02]: The Atari ST and Amiga versions are supposed to have better graphics and sound effects.

1582
01:47:53,001 --> 01:47:56,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And the NES version was developed by Microtronics.

1583
01:47:57,724 --> 01:48:00,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem with the NES one is it was flashy, flashy, flash, flash, flash.

1584
01:48:00,746 --> 01:48:02,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Glitch-tastic.

1585
01:48:02,887 --> 01:48:03,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a cool game.

1586
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the NES.

1587
01:48:19,898 --> 01:48:20,258
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1588
01:48:20,739 --> 01:48:21,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there it is.

1589
01:48:21,419 --> 01:48:22,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Your classic game of the week.

1590
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you how I picked it.

1591
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:28,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in the vault, grabbed one of the bins, and put my finger on a game.

1592
01:48:28,364 --> 01:48:29,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

1593
01:48:29,384 --> 01:48:29,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I picked it.

1594
01:48:30,005 --> 01:48:30,705
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you picked it.

1595
01:48:31,186 --> 01:48:32,226
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how she does it, folks.

1596
01:48:32,647 --> 01:48:38,310
[SPEAKER_07]: But I approve because, you know, again, any game that uses ABBA as a code, it's awesome.

1597
01:48:38,531 --> 01:48:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they dancing queens?

1598
01:48:39,951 --> 01:48:42,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot imagine Ralph and Clark doing disco dancing.

1599
01:48:42,813 --> 01:48:48,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Contrary to what Spazinator is saying in chat, ABBA will not play an 8-bit version of Dancing Queen, although I think that should be in a future game.

1600
01:48:49,278 --> 01:48:49,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1601
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:55,601
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so that's going to wrap up this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1602
01:48:55,621 --> 01:49:02,025
[SPEAKER_07]: There is plenty more to come in Part B. We've got more news, lots and lots of good stuff, Twitter topics.

1603
01:49:02,205 --> 01:49:04,627
[SPEAKER_07]: And tonight, I'm so excited because Jessica's here.

1604
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:06,408
[SPEAKER_07]: We thought we'd do something special.

1605
01:49:06,868 --> 01:49:09,490
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do listless tonight with Jessica.

1606
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:11,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And the topic tonight, you ready for this?

1607
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:15,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Jessica's got to think about this because I'm springing this on her during break.

1608
01:49:15,214 --> 01:49:15,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1609
01:49:15,934 --> 01:49:16,835
[SPEAKER_07]: The topic tonight...

1610
01:49:17,535 --> 01:49:22,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing I learned most from DDR Freak is tonight's listless topic.

1611
01:49:23,297 --> 01:49:26,318
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing I learned most from DDR Freak.

1612
01:49:26,338 --> 01:49:29,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a fun night, ladies and gentlemen.

1613
01:49:29,759 --> 01:49:33,720
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1614
01:49:39,552 --> 01:49:42,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1615
01:49:42,554 --> 01:49:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live on October the 17th of 2010 with the 386th episode of our show.

1616
01:49:49,397 --> 01:49:51,018
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a super fast computer if this is 1982.

1617
01:49:51,058 --> 01:49:51,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Or 1992.

1618
01:49:51,198 --> 01:49:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, 386.

1619
01:49:51,458 --> 01:49:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1620
01:49:52,839 --> 01:49:53,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a 38620.

1621
01:49:53,179 --> 01:49:53,859
[SPEAKER_07]: My first PC was a 386SX16.

1622
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:55,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's running in turbo mode.

1623
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:56,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise it's a 38616.

1624
01:49:56,541 --> 01:49:56,661
[SPEAKER_05]: With

1625
01:50:07,546 --> 01:50:10,888
[SPEAKER_05]: with, get this, a 30 megabyte hard drive.

1626
01:50:10,988 --> 01:50:12,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god!

1627
01:50:12,469 --> 01:50:15,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And one megabyte of RAM.

1628
01:50:15,511 --> 01:50:16,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit!

1629
01:50:18,133 --> 01:50:19,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Running Windows 3.1.

1630
01:50:20,135 --> 01:50:22,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think it was 3.0 at that time.

1631
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:25,838
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend's dad is an engineer, back in the 40s.

1632
01:50:26,599 --> 01:50:32,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was talking about one time we were visiting and he was saying that they lined the room in magnets to make 1K of memory.

1633
01:50:32,963 --> 01:50:33,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1634
01:50:34,244 --> 01:50:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about that.

1635
01:50:35,565 --> 01:50:36,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun stuff.

1636
01:50:36,126 --> 01:50:37,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what are we running?

1637
01:50:38,187 --> 01:50:41,230
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go spend $90 and get a terabyte hard drive.

1638
01:50:42,331 --> 01:50:42,711
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

1639
01:50:43,051 --> 01:50:43,712
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

1640
01:50:44,252 --> 01:50:45,113
[SPEAKER_07]: For it for all.

1641
01:50:45,353 --> 01:50:51,779
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're just joining us after this break, the other voice you hear there is our lovely guest tonight, Jessica Harper from Under Sedation Live.

1642
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But we remember her as Iguana Girl from DDR Freak.

1643
01:50:55,001 --> 01:50:55,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl.

1644
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:56,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl.

1645
01:50:56,022 --> 01:50:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1646
01:50:56,402 --> 01:50:57,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Iguana Girl.

1647
01:50:57,563 --> 01:50:59,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Iguana Girl.

1648
01:50:59,125 --> 01:50:59,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl.

1649
01:51:01,266 --> 01:51:02,087
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

1650
01:51:02,247 --> 01:51:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's here tonight because she's helping us reminisce about the good old days of DDR and all that.

1651
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:09,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, kind of where are they now?

1652
01:51:09,512 --> 01:51:15,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And we definitely found out some interesting stuff in Part A about the behind-the-scenes operations of DDR Freak.

1653
01:51:15,436 --> 01:51:18,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I know what types of questions not to ask moving forward.

1654
01:51:18,918 --> 01:51:26,823
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know how much you can kind of say about this, but I know you eventually stepped down as administrator of DDR Freak, as most people do.

1655
01:51:26,864 --> 01:51:28,204
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, these things kind of come in cycles.

1656
01:51:28,224 --> 01:51:29,685
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only so much time you can give up.

1657
01:51:29,745 --> 01:51:29,866
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1658
01:51:31,446 --> 01:51:34,328
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you kind of think about where DDR Freak is at now?

1659
01:51:34,368 --> 01:51:36,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's kind of past its prime?

1660
01:51:36,109 --> 01:51:37,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's old and dead and gone?

1661
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:37,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead.

1662
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:48,996
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a few people that are straggling in there, but even Random Chat, which is the absolute most frequented forum, it will go a full day without any kind of hits at all at this point.

1663
01:51:49,376 --> 01:51:53,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried looking back like six months ago and was completely depressed.

1664
01:51:54,179 --> 01:52:01,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's the occasional where are they now type of thread, but pretty much what's going on at this point is just eh.

1665
01:52:02,408 --> 01:52:03,109
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?

1666
01:52:03,469 --> 01:52:05,732
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be the place to be.

1667
01:52:06,252 --> 01:52:07,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that most of it is just the

1668
01:52:08,715 --> 01:52:18,178
[SPEAKER_04]: The mainstream nature of DDR has kind of killed it a bit, and a lot of the old school people don't necessarily like the new class, so to speak.

1669
01:52:18,478 --> 01:52:28,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that just overall, the site started getting slower and slower, started having issues, and people just weren't as interested anymore.

1670
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:28,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1671
01:52:29,241 --> 01:52:35,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, you're probably right, and I think probably Konami's lack of support for DDR for a very long time probably contributed to that.

1672
01:52:35,448 --> 01:52:35,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1673
01:52:35,948 --> 01:52:38,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely, so that's a bummer, but...

1674
01:52:39,932 --> 01:52:43,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other forums that you surf these days that we can find you on?

1675
01:52:44,313 --> 01:52:45,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Not particularly.

1676
01:52:45,654 --> 01:52:49,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of what I do is just, you know, I sit and play on Facebook most of the time.

1677
01:52:50,655 --> 01:52:53,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just, I already have a group of friends.

1678
01:52:53,296 --> 01:52:56,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really necessarily looking to go search out a whole new group of friends or anything.

1679
01:52:56,857 --> 01:52:58,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just kind of do my own thing.

1680
01:53:00,051 --> 01:53:04,333
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can at least be found Saturday nights at Under Station Live right here at All Games Radio.

1681
01:53:04,353 --> 01:53:09,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I do also have a Facebook that is my public Facebook for Under Station Live.

1682
01:53:09,836 --> 01:53:12,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find me under Jessica Harper on Facebook if you want to add me.

1683
01:53:13,378 --> 01:53:17,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll sometimes post interesting pictures and what have you through that.

1684
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, kind of an online version of me.

1685
01:53:21,565 --> 01:53:22,646
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, check that out.

1686
01:53:22,886 --> 01:53:23,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

1687
01:53:24,167 --> 01:53:26,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick news.

1688
01:53:26,269 --> 01:53:31,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to say, though, first, since Jessica's our guest this week, we already have a guest lined up for next week as well.

1689
01:53:32,315 --> 01:53:34,517
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like suddenly we're like the month of guests.

1690
01:53:34,577 --> 01:53:38,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this because it's another in-studio guest, which is very exciting.

1691
01:53:38,881 --> 01:53:40,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Seg is going to be here next week.

1692
01:53:40,682 --> 01:53:40,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

1693
01:53:41,703 --> 01:53:43,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Seg has theme music.

1694
01:53:43,845 --> 01:53:44,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

1695
01:53:46,505 --> 01:53:49,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Fail on my part, the music bag, or the mailbag music aired a little early.

1696
01:53:49,767 --> 01:54:05,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Seg is going to be here next week and he's going to talk all about Umlaut, which is his big, and if you've been listening to the show for a while, you probably heard him on the show last year, but this time he's going to come in studio so he can actually talk to us throughout the night and definitely pimp Umlaut, which is going on, well, it's not going on right now, but the

1697
01:54:05,399 --> 01:54:08,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Pre-Antics are going on right now on the website.

1698
01:54:08,364 --> 01:54:09,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Umlaut.org.

1699
01:54:09,365 --> 01:54:11,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fundraiser, of course, for Child's Play.

1700
01:54:11,489 --> 01:54:13,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to happen in San Francisco in December.

1701
01:54:13,552 --> 01:54:16,477
[SPEAKER_07]: All the details are there at Umlaut.org.

1702
01:54:16,497 --> 01:54:18,119
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even have to know how to type the Umlaut.

1703
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:18,840
[SPEAKER_07]: When is it, Ian?

1704
01:54:19,381 --> 01:54:20,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It is December...

1705
01:54:20,783 --> 01:54:22,764
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be running Rock Band 3 this time?

1706
01:54:22,824 --> 01:54:23,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I believe so.

1707
01:54:23,865 --> 01:54:26,246
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get all the details from SAG next week, so I don't want to spoil everything.

1708
01:54:26,586 --> 01:54:28,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But I believe it's December 9th?

1709
01:54:29,468 --> 01:54:30,428
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Thursday.

1710
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:32,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that, because it got bumped up.

1711
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:36,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Because last year it was on a Monday, and now it's a bigger deal this year.

1712
01:54:36,632 --> 01:54:37,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually on a Thursday.

1713
01:54:37,792 --> 01:54:38,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got to ask about that.

1714
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:39,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got the date right.

1715
01:54:39,513 --> 01:54:40,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It is December 9th, 2010.

1716
01:54:41,554 --> 01:54:44,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I do believe Rock Band 3 is a part of it as well.

1717
01:54:44,457 --> 01:54:45,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get all the details.

1718
01:54:46,219 --> 01:54:50,704
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be some big, big, big band package deals that weren't around last year.

1719
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:52,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about that as well.

1720
01:54:52,926 --> 01:54:58,252
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not in the San Francisco Bay Area and you don't feel like driving or flying out here for it, you still can donate online.

1721
01:54:59,013 --> 01:55:03,878
[SPEAKER_07]: umloud.org, U-M-L-O-U-D dot O-R-G for all the details.

1722
01:55:04,418 --> 01:55:05,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1723
01:55:19,949 --> 01:55:21,931
[SPEAKER_07]: There's these little NDAs and things.

1724
01:55:22,011 --> 01:55:25,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And pitch him our idea for the Elvira adventure game.

1725
01:55:25,474 --> 01:55:26,936
[SPEAKER_07]: He's listening right now, so he might have heard it.

1726
01:55:27,216 --> 01:55:28,838
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, we'll try to pitch him our ideas.

1727
01:55:29,298 --> 01:55:34,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And at least the games that are out, we can hopefully ask some good questions on and all that stuff.

1728
01:55:34,543 --> 01:55:35,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'll be good.

1729
01:55:35,404 --> 01:55:37,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk to them about all that fun stuff next week.

1730
01:55:39,027 --> 01:55:39,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to look forward to.

1731
01:55:40,048 --> 01:55:42,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this whole having guests every week thing.

1732
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:49,016
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Tiara a couple weeks ago, and now we have Guanagirl, Jessica Harper's here tonight, and then we've got Seg next week.

1733
01:55:49,476 --> 01:55:50,037
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.

1734
01:55:51,077 --> 01:55:52,819
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to get some more game developers in here, too.

1735
01:55:52,859 --> 01:55:56,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we can get them to travel all the way out to SAC, but we know the Skype thing works okay.

1736
01:55:57,302 --> 01:55:58,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a sleep on my couch

1737
01:56:15,487 --> 01:56:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely if you have Twitter questions about the old school days, we'd love to hear it.

1738
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we will happily take any topic.

1739
01:56:20,051 --> 01:56:21,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1740
01:56:21,853 --> 01:56:23,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Get those tweets in right now.

1741
01:56:23,454 --> 01:56:27,138
[SPEAKER_07]: You got about five minutes, five to ten minutes while we do some fast news.

1742
01:56:27,958 --> 01:56:30,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't submit tweets, I'm going to let Jessica just tweet all night.

1743
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet, tweet.

1744
01:56:32,361 --> 01:56:51,887
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I'll play the Rockin' Robin song and then let her do the tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet exactly alright in the meantime quick news Loki oh my god you better run out in a hurry and pick up Outrun Online Arcade because if you procrastinate for another 13 months then you may not be able to get it

1745
01:56:52,587 --> 01:56:53,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's Outrun!

1746
01:56:53,028 --> 01:56:53,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Outrun!

1747
01:57:22,785 --> 01:57:24,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have 50 million other versions of Outrun.

1748
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:33,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bummer that it's getting pulled for an understandable reason, but at the same time it's kind of dumb.

1749
01:57:33,518 --> 01:57:35,020
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least it's not getting pulled because it sucks.

1750
01:57:36,762 --> 01:57:37,984
[SPEAKER_02]: We have loads of cash.

1751
01:57:38,044 --> 01:57:38,985
[SPEAKER_02]: We are Italian.

1752
01:57:39,025 --> 01:57:39,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and have it.

1753
01:57:41,715 --> 01:57:47,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the Future Telltale's new game Back to the Future, the video game I liked that one

1754
01:58:08,601 --> 01:58:09,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1755
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:39,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

1756
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:40,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

1757
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:43,540
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Back to the Future is kind of a big deal.

1758
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,761
[SPEAKER_07]: The Blu-ray is kind of a big deal.

1759
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:48,002
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting a lot of like... You know what's kind of weird though?

1760
01:58:48,422 --> 01:58:52,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Is they've already given away the coupon code, I guess.

1761
01:58:52,803 --> 01:58:58,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's going to be exclusive to each one or if it's just saying... But it says apparently there is a...

1762
01:59:00,865 --> 01:59:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: A picture of the actual code thing.

1763
01:59:02,926 --> 01:59:15,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, the URL insert list, a URL for redeeming the included code, 121 gigawatts, which currently directs the browsers to the game's homepage.

1764
01:59:16,215 --> 01:59:21,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, of course, it will go live as they get closer to it.

1765
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know if 1.2 or 121 gigawatt is going to be the code, but

1766
01:59:31,225 --> 01:59:33,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, something a little extra if you buy Back to the Future.

1767
01:59:34,768 --> 01:59:38,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should because it's an awesome movie series and they keep replaying it on G4 for some reason.

1768
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:41,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty sure the game this time will be much better than the NES one.

1769
01:59:41,712 --> 01:59:42,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Just call it a hunch.

1770
01:59:42,452 --> 01:59:43,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1771
01:59:43,313 --> 01:59:43,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Call it a hunch.

1772
01:59:43,913 --> 01:59:44,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1773
01:59:45,394 --> 01:59:48,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they have like Christopher Lloyd actually doing voice acting and all that, right?

1774
01:59:48,396 --> 01:59:48,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1775
01:59:48,676 --> 01:59:49,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be epic.

1776
01:59:49,357 --> 01:59:52,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Get him to say as many things as possible before he dies.

1777
01:59:52,379 --> 01:59:53,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1778
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:56,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have him read the whole dictionary and we'll be done with it.

1779
01:59:56,561 --> 01:59:57,402
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a Klingon once.

1780
01:59:59,537 --> 02:00:00,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

1781
02:00:01,638 --> 02:00:01,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1782
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:05,801
[SPEAKER_05]: He should host a science show as Doc Brown.

1783
02:00:05,941 --> 02:00:07,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1784
02:00:08,223 --> 02:00:09,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Seg is actually in our chat tonight.

1785
02:00:10,164 --> 02:00:11,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy to hear about his appearance.

1786
02:00:11,105 --> 02:00:15,308
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually saying that theaters are going to be showing Back to the Future at the end of this month.

1787
02:00:15,388 --> 02:00:16,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's like a revival thing.

1788
02:00:17,009 --> 02:00:17,649
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1789
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:18,110
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1790
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:18,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.

1791
02:00:18,430 --> 02:00:21,212
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but seriously though, Christopher Lloyd needs to host a science show.

1792
02:00:21,332 --> 02:00:22,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw Bill Nye.

1793
02:00:22,973 --> 02:00:24,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I be honest about something though?

1794
02:00:24,934 --> 02:00:28,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen the original Back to the Future the whole way through actually.

1795
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,808
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1796
02:00:31,048 --> 02:00:32,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Out!

1797
02:00:32,769 --> 02:00:33,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't.

1798
02:00:33,289 --> 02:00:33,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

1799
02:00:33,769 --> 02:00:34,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the funny thing.

1800
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:41,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen the third movie the whole way through because they showed it when I was in seventh grade on VHS or whatever.

1801
02:00:42,193 --> 02:00:43,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I have never seen the original movie the whole way through.

1802
02:00:44,334 --> 02:00:48,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the first one in the theater, the third one in the theater, and I didn't see the second one until I was an adult.

1803
02:00:49,976 --> 02:00:52,917
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always that one movie you miss as a kid, except I missed a few.

1804
02:00:54,975 --> 02:00:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first movie, Rob?

1805
02:00:56,317 --> 02:00:57,199
[SPEAKER_07]: My first movie?

1806
02:00:57,539 --> 02:00:58,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?

1807
02:00:59,061 --> 02:00:59,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you told?

1808
02:01:00,003 --> 02:01:05,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told that I was taken to see The Empire Strikes Back at the 99 Cent Theater.

1809
02:01:06,051 --> 02:01:07,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of have something in common then.

1810
02:01:08,254 --> 02:01:09,857
[SPEAKER_02]: My first movie was Star Wars.

1811
02:01:10,367 --> 02:01:10,487
[SPEAKER_05]: E.T.

1812
02:01:10,507 --> 02:01:11,288
[SPEAKER_05]: at the drive-in

1813
02:01:33,764 --> 02:01:35,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure you saw E.T., but the one I can only remember.

1814
02:01:36,026 --> 02:01:36,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw E.T.

1815
02:01:36,827 --> 02:01:37,407
[SPEAKER_02]: in the theater.

1816
02:01:38,228 --> 02:01:38,288
[SPEAKER_02]: E.T.

1817
02:01:38,428 --> 02:01:39,409
[SPEAKER_07]: was probably before all that.

1818
02:01:39,809 --> 02:01:42,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, what, five, six?

1819
02:01:43,473 --> 02:01:46,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I also remember going to see The Aristocats by Disney.

1820
02:01:46,836 --> 02:01:49,578
[SPEAKER_02]: The first movie that I saw four times in a row, though, was Wrath of Khan.

1821
02:01:50,828 --> 02:02:00,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember also we went to a drive-in to see, it was a double feature, Shrimp on the Barbie and Batman.

1822
02:02:01,236 --> 02:02:04,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really wanted to see Batman.

1823
02:02:04,578 --> 02:02:09,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately Shrimp on the Barbie was... The fuck do those two movies have in common?

1824
02:02:09,943 --> 02:02:10,823
[SPEAKER_04]: They always do that.

1825
02:02:11,244 --> 02:02:16,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea, but for some reason I fell asleep through Batman.

1826
02:02:18,089 --> 02:02:19,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And I woke up, I'm like...

1827
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Batman?

1828
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:25,794
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom's like, we tried to wake you up, but you said you wanted to sleep.

1829
02:02:25,854 --> 02:02:27,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I didn't!

1830
02:02:29,377 --> 02:02:30,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I eventually saw it later on.

1831
02:02:31,018 --> 02:02:32,199
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of funny, though.

1832
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Shrimp on the barbecue.

1833
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:36,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that would put you to sleep, I can imagine.

1834
02:02:37,883 --> 02:02:42,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But that must have been the second movie, for some reason, because if I slept through Batman...

1835
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:52,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, sorry, since we're talking about movies though, there of course is rumors that the Uncharted movie needs to move forward.

1836
02:02:53,349 --> 02:02:59,995
[SPEAKER_05]: People want this to become a movie because I guess, you know, the game lends itself well to a movie.

1837
02:03:01,036 --> 02:03:04,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And funny enough, the main character, which has been compared to Nathan Fillion...

1838
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:33,406
[SPEAKER_05]: um actually now Nathan Fillion is trying to start a campaign on Twitter to be cast as Nathan Drake so um that's interesting because I guess he looks kind of like the main character he does a little bit but I don't know I don't see the entire resemblance there but he's sort of I mean it could work there'd be fanboys that would be very happy if that were to happen I don't know I'd drool

1839
02:03:35,839 --> 02:03:36,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's telling you he's too old.

1840
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:38,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dan's piping in from the other end.

1841
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:38,720
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1842
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:40,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny Glover needs to be Nathan Drake.

1843
02:03:40,921 --> 02:03:42,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1844
02:03:42,442 --> 02:03:44,102
[SPEAKER_04]: A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

1845
02:03:45,023 --> 02:03:46,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get Betty White to be Nathan Drake.

1846
02:03:50,685 --> 02:03:51,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan says, should do.

1847
02:03:51,986 --> 02:03:52,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan approves of Betty White.

1848
02:03:55,107 --> 02:03:59,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to cast Betty White in like a big blockbuster action flick.

1849
02:03:59,349 --> 02:04:03,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to see Red because, I mean, can you imagine Helen Mirren with an AK?

1850
02:04:03,531 --> 02:04:04,231
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1851
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, here you go, an action movie starring Betty White called Grandma Death.

1852
02:04:09,862 --> 02:04:10,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go see it.

1853
02:04:11,204 --> 02:04:11,664
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1854
02:04:11,684 --> 02:04:12,425
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1855
02:04:13,265 --> 02:04:15,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep in mind, they did the Machete movie, remember?

1856
02:04:16,028 --> 02:04:16,968
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true, there you go.

1857
02:04:17,029 --> 02:04:19,991
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the movie based off of a trailer of a non-existent movie?

1858
02:04:20,091 --> 02:04:21,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1859
02:04:21,232 --> 02:04:23,894
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do another Grindhouse movie with Betty White in it.

1860
02:04:24,135 --> 02:04:24,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Grandma Death?

1861
02:04:24,915 --> 02:04:25,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandma Death.

1862
02:04:25,396 --> 02:04:27,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be like Kill Bill, but it's Betty White.

1863
02:04:27,377 --> 02:04:27,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1864
02:04:29,503 --> 02:04:32,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully she does all her own stuff.

1865
02:04:32,344 --> 02:04:35,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad Barbara Billingsley is dead because she can be her co-star.

1866
02:04:36,166 --> 02:04:37,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

1867
02:04:37,807 --> 02:04:38,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Only if she talked Jive.

1868
02:04:38,867 --> 02:04:41,808
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as she can get her before she starts to decompose, it might be alright.

1869
02:04:42,609 --> 02:04:45,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched an interview of her about learning to talk Jive, by the way.

1870
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So did I. Yours would be a bit like, kill Ernest.

1871
02:04:49,352 --> 02:04:50,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Ernest Borgnine.

1872
02:04:50,252 --> 02:04:50,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1873
02:04:54,625 --> 02:04:55,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

1874
02:04:55,386 --> 02:04:56,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with some news.

1875
02:04:56,708 --> 02:04:58,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how we got on to this whole Betty White.

1876
02:05:03,772 --> 02:05:04,573
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

1877
02:05:05,273 --> 02:05:06,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Crazy Taxi.

1878
02:05:06,695 --> 02:05:07,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Crazy Taxi.

1879
02:05:07,976 --> 02:05:13,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out on November 23rd on the PlayStation Network, November 24th on Xbox Live Arcade.

1880
02:05:13,621 --> 02:05:16,924
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're ready to get some crazy money, it's going to cost you $10.

1881
02:05:17,004 --> 02:05:17,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be widescreen.

1882
02:05:18,025 --> 02:05:22,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It will have 720p high def graphics.

1883
02:05:22,409 --> 02:05:27,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It will not have the offspring music, sadly, and it will not have Pizza Hut.

1884
02:05:27,554 --> 02:05:27,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1885
02:05:27,994 --> 02:05:28,515
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

1886
02:05:28,935 --> 02:05:31,916
[SPEAKER_07]: All these games have an options menu where you can turn down the music.

1887
02:05:31,976 --> 02:05:40,219
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you do, turn down whatever crap music they end up putting in the game and then do a Xbox 360 custom soundtrack.

1888
02:05:55,944 --> 02:05:59,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't they get new licensing?

1889
02:05:59,326 --> 02:06:03,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure KFC would do it in like, you know, Old Navy or something.

1890
02:06:04,469 --> 02:06:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Take me to Old Navy!

1891
02:06:07,651 --> 02:06:08,932
[SPEAKER_05]: No, bitch, off the pier!

1892
02:06:12,386 --> 02:06:13,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You're driving too fast!

1893
02:06:14,166 --> 02:06:15,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Take me to the Gap!

1894
02:06:15,227 --> 02:06:16,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Not until they change the logo, bitch!

1895
02:06:16,907 --> 02:06:17,667
[SPEAKER_02]: They did, they fixed it.

1896
02:06:17,687 --> 02:06:19,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I heard, I heard.

1897
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:20,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, get this.

1898
02:06:20,668 --> 02:06:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even that.

1899
02:06:23,509 --> 02:06:26,710
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, my non-designer friends were talking about typography with me.

1900
02:06:27,590 --> 02:06:31,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, they were using Helvetica and it was ugly, a bad use of Helvetica.

1901
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:36,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to look to find it and there's no more pictures of it online except for the Gap logo sucks Twitter.

1902
02:06:37,633 --> 02:06:38,733
[SPEAKER_02]: They hunted that shit down.

1903
02:06:39,853 --> 02:06:41,994
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, kind of an interesting point in chat.

1904
02:06:42,655 --> 02:06:45,896
[SPEAKER_07]: What if all the licenses had been stuff that is now gone?

1905
02:06:46,156 --> 02:06:47,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, take me to Tower Records!

1906
02:06:50,118 --> 02:06:51,259
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be sad.

1907
02:06:51,519 --> 02:06:52,619
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be sadness.

1908
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me to Tower, I mean, Dipple!

1909
02:06:56,741 --> 02:06:57,542
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're still there.

1910
02:06:57,882 --> 02:06:59,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I'm sorry.

1911
02:06:59,724 --> 02:07:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Take me to Tower Records.

1912
02:07:00,745 --> 02:07:01,545
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean R5.

1913
02:07:01,645 --> 02:07:02,386
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean Dimple.

1914
02:07:03,967 --> 02:07:04,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what else?

1915
02:07:04,708 --> 02:07:07,791
[SPEAKER_07]: What other big things have closed down lately that just all went under?

1916
02:07:08,231 --> 02:07:09,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Take me to Mervin's.

1917
02:07:10,453 --> 02:07:10,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't.

1918
02:07:10,893 --> 02:07:12,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Montgomery Ward's.

1919
02:07:17,717 --> 02:07:38,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band News There's a whole list of Rock Band songs available in this little web widget that you can embed in your site It's in celebration of the 2000th song to hit Rock Band Going to find research online can be kind of tough There's a whole little widget that made its way to a lot of gaming blogs

1920
02:07:38,988 --> 02:07:47,689
[SPEAKER_07]: and the cool thing is you can search you can sort by artist, you can sort by year, you can sort by the genre and it's just basically like a quick online little web widget to find the finder.

1921
02:07:47,729 --> 02:07:54,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to see okay, Lady Gaga Why am I not surprised?

1922
02:07:54,571 --> 02:07:58,771
[SPEAKER_07]: There are four Lady Gaga songs in the game.

1923
02:07:58,811 --> 02:07:59,011
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gay!

1924
02:08:00,732 --> 02:08:01,532
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your point?

1925
02:08:01,872 --> 02:08:05,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's one Eric Cartman Lady Gaga song that's in there.

1926
02:08:05,212 --> 02:08:05,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's great.

1927
02:08:06,113 --> 02:08:06,493
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1928
02:08:08,664 --> 02:08:09,606
[SPEAKER_07]: One more story for you guys.

1929
02:08:09,746 --> 02:08:10,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Another music game.

1930
02:08:10,567 --> 02:08:13,070
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Hero 2 is getting some download contents.

1931
02:08:13,211 --> 02:08:16,675
[SPEAKER_07]: The first comes in November is the first pack.

1932
02:08:16,756 --> 02:08:19,660
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be the Hitmakers Mix Pack.

1933
02:08:20,721 --> 02:08:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Rihanna's Umbrella versus Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.

1934
02:08:24,406 --> 02:08:25,467
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be kind of interesting.

1935
02:08:25,767 --> 02:08:28,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Two weeks later, an Electro Hits mix pack.

1936
02:08:28,109 --> 02:08:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be kind of awesome, actually.

1937
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:38,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the Electro Hits, it has LMFAO with I'm in Miami trick, because they have to change the lyrics, mixed with Green Velvet, Shake and Pop.

1938
02:08:39,218 --> 02:08:40,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of this might be kind of awesome, actually.

1939
02:08:41,279 --> 02:08:43,781
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all coming out in November.

1940
02:08:44,161 --> 02:09:00,033
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, there will also be a free compatibility update in November to enable support for the existing DJ Hero DLC in DJ Hero 2, which is great because the best DJ Hero song was that Mary J. Blige All of Me vs. Queen Radio Gaga.

1941
02:09:00,053 --> 02:09:01,434
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no better song in the game.

1942
02:09:01,554 --> 02:09:02,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fantastic.

1943
02:09:02,855 --> 02:09:03,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my favorite.

1944
02:09:03,475 --> 02:09:06,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, let's make that our after show music.

1945
02:09:07,075 --> 02:09:07,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1946
02:09:08,058 --> 02:09:08,620
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can find it.

1947
02:09:09,683 --> 02:09:10,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1948
02:09:10,446 --> 02:09:12,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1949
02:09:12,981 --> 02:09:13,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I have stuff.

1950
02:09:14,522 --> 02:09:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Things.

1951
02:09:15,743 --> 02:09:17,504
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some Guitar Hero stuff?

1952
02:09:18,245 --> 02:09:22,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is enough to save them, though, even though I think it's amazing.

1953
02:09:23,029 --> 02:09:35,998
[SPEAKER_02]: There is going to be a free three-pack for Gold members that has Disturbs the Infection, Muses Resistance, cool song, My Chemical Romance is Na Na Na, another band that I like.

1954
02:09:37,259 --> 02:09:41,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be available to be purchased by Silver Live users on October 19th.

1955
02:09:42,743 --> 02:09:58,354
[SPEAKER_02]: and then on the 26th of October there will be a Rocky Horror Picture Show pack and that's pretty cool it has Time Warp and Sweet Transvestite and Hot Patootie and also completely unrelated is Soundgarden's Telephantasm

1956
02:09:59,631 --> 02:10:02,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, not enough to get me to spend $60 on the game, but I think it's really cool.

1957
02:10:03,412 --> 02:10:07,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also reminds me that the Rocky Horror Blu-ray is out, I believe, this Tuesday.

1958
02:10:07,714 --> 02:10:10,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of want to check that out because I'm curious how it turned out.

1959
02:10:10,115 --> 02:10:15,477
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was saying that that's the only thing that's probably going to remotely get me to watch that show that starts with a G that I don't like.

1960
02:10:16,843 --> 02:10:20,846
[SPEAKER_04]: and Imagine That exactly 10 years after they released the DVD.

1961
02:10:21,547 --> 02:10:22,367
[SPEAKER_04]: They released the Blu-ray.

1962
02:10:22,387 --> 02:10:23,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Here comes the Blu-ray.

1963
02:10:23,408 --> 02:10:26,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently it's got a live shadow cast thing going on in it and all this stuff.

1964
02:10:26,991 --> 02:10:27,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Picture in picture.

1965
02:10:28,352 --> 02:10:28,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be interesting.

1966
02:10:29,193 --> 02:10:29,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1967
02:10:29,693 --> 02:10:30,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious.

1968
02:10:30,894 --> 02:10:34,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't think this whole Rocky Horror Glee thing isn't a cross promotion.

1969
02:10:34,737 --> 02:10:39,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I will bet money there's a commercial for the Blu-ray during the Glee episode.

1970
02:10:39,441 --> 02:10:41,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know what I really, really want to see?

1971
02:10:41,723 --> 02:10:41,943
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1972
02:10:42,644 --> 02:10:44,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Tony Head as Frank.

1973
02:10:46,739 --> 02:11:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: we got to see that at that same convention we played I understand that he brought it in person I understand that he brought his own gear you might still be able to catch it they'll probably play it a little bit closer but VH1, they were actually filming a karaoke version you can probably find it on YouTube actually of Anthony Head playing he's so great I loved the single that he did that was really great I'm positive you can find that on YouTube

1974
02:11:15,616 --> 02:11:18,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be looking something up tonight when I'm supposed to be doing my homework.

1975
02:11:19,438 --> 02:11:22,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan very much wants me to watch that Rocky Horror Glee episode.

1976
02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:23,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think Glee's okay.

1977
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:30,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched about half the first season, and you know, it's fine, but I really am not liking this idea of them doing the Rocky Horror because I know it's just gonna be hard to watch.

1978
02:11:30,643 --> 02:11:33,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you actually watched the stuff that Richard's been posting?

1979
02:11:33,584 --> 02:11:36,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard some of the songs that were posted, and...

1980
02:11:36,886 --> 02:11:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch some of the stuff.

1981
02:11:39,087 --> 02:11:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not watch Glee at all.

1982
02:11:41,768 --> 02:11:44,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never watch Glee after this, but I'll probably watch this one.

1983
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:46,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1984
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:49,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard the way they did Sweet Transvestite and I'm not a fan.

1985
02:11:50,292 --> 02:11:54,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the Dammit Janet and some of the other stuff though, but I'm curious.

1986
02:11:54,954 --> 02:11:59,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I will watch it, but Alan's like, you need to sit there and live blog it and tape your eyes open.

1987
02:11:59,736 --> 02:12:00,736
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta watch the whole thing.

1988
02:12:01,216 --> 02:12:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just kind of like, only if you do too, because he hates Glee.

1989
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:04,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1990
02:12:06,138 --> 02:12:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, I did look at the stills they had in the sets and costumes.

1991
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:12,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked pretty awesome.

1992
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:17,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that they had to dumb it down for broadcast TV.

1993
02:12:18,082 --> 02:12:22,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand you can't have somebody portraying a teenager running around in the Rocky costume.

1994
02:12:22,683 --> 02:12:23,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that.

1995
02:12:23,123 --> 02:12:23,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1996
02:12:23,863 --> 02:12:26,524
[SPEAKER_07]: But they really, really washed down some of the lyrics.

1997
02:12:26,744 --> 02:12:29,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just a sweet transvestite from sensational Transylvania.

1998
02:12:30,245 --> 02:12:30,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1999
02:12:31,638 --> 02:12:33,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of defeats the point, honey.

2000
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:34,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2001
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:34,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

2002
02:12:35,621 --> 02:12:35,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well.

2003
02:12:36,241 --> 02:12:38,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll watch it and it won't be that bad.

2004
02:12:38,323 --> 02:12:41,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be more interesting to visit transsexual than sensational.

2005
02:12:42,265 --> 02:12:48,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be happy that at least it's getting attention and it'll bring more curious kids to the midnight movie.

2006
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:50,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it'll die off like it always does.

2007
02:12:50,711 --> 02:12:50,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2008
02:12:51,492 --> 02:12:52,713
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least we'll have that moment.

2009
02:12:52,753 --> 02:12:58,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But, by the way, they are doing a Rocky Horror Show downtown right now.

2010
02:12:58,817 --> 02:12:59,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh really?

2011
02:12:59,317 --> 02:12:59,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go.

2012
02:12:59,958 --> 02:13:00,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

2013
02:13:01,078 --> 02:13:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to send you guys the invite so you can take a look.

2014
02:13:02,959 --> 02:13:03,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.

2015
02:13:03,399 --> 02:13:06,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 15 bucks and they're actually doing live performances.

2016
02:13:06,681 --> 02:13:09,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It started this past weekend all the way through until Halloween.

2017
02:13:09,983 --> 02:13:10,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.

2018
02:13:10,843 --> 02:13:11,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to go.

2019
02:13:11,884 --> 02:13:12,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go a lot.

2020
02:13:12,824 --> 02:13:13,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

2021
02:13:13,345 --> 02:13:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we saw when ARC put it on.

2022
02:13:16,126 --> 02:13:16,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2023
02:13:16,366 --> 02:13:16,766
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cute.

2024
02:13:16,826 --> 02:13:17,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that too.

2025
02:13:17,967 --> 02:13:18,287
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

2026
02:13:41,655 --> 02:13:45,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Other news, Dead Space is going to be coming out on the iPad.

2027
02:13:45,576 --> 02:13:47,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be out in December according to EA.

2028
02:13:49,878 --> 02:13:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that there's a big press event at Tokyo's Apple Store that will be featuring this.

2029
02:13:57,220 --> 02:14:01,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a third-person shooter, no rails, no changing modes.

2030
02:14:02,603 --> 02:14:09,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing said about the iPhone, so maybe it will be better than the Xbox Live Arcade version?

2031
02:14:09,506 --> 02:14:10,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who knows?

2032
02:14:11,466 --> 02:14:11,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

2033
02:14:12,967 --> 02:14:19,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live Arcade, other news, is in nine more countries now, starting on 10th of November.

2034
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:21,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe not now, but in the futures.

2035
02:14:22,971 --> 02:14:29,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Russia, Poland, South Africa, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile

2036
02:14:44,942 --> 02:14:50,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I must go to bed, but it's 2am, but I have to see number 7!

2037
02:14:50,886 --> 02:14:52,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I read about it on CNN, I didn't watch a minute of it.

2038
02:14:52,687 --> 02:14:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I thought was awesome about it?

2039
02:14:54,007 --> 02:14:57,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it totally wasn't the overblown media circus that it would have been in America.

2040
02:14:57,770 --> 02:15:03,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And the freaking president came out by himself without guards or anything to help with the effort.

2041
02:15:03,353 --> 02:15:05,334
[SPEAKER_02]: To be there with the families, and that was cool.

2042
02:15:05,474 --> 02:15:08,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I was reminded of, pardon the pun, Baby Jessica.

2043
02:15:09,136 --> 02:15:09,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2044
02:15:09,336 --> 02:15:10,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching that whole thing.

2045
02:15:10,297 --> 02:15:10,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember?

2046
02:15:10,877 --> 02:15:11,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day.

2047
02:15:11,878 --> 02:15:12,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day.

2048
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:14,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Way before most of our listeners were born.

2049
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2050
02:15:15,181 --> 02:15:18,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I read an interview with her where she says, God, I can't believe people remember me for that.

2051
02:15:19,684 --> 02:15:19,844
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2052
02:15:19,884 --> 02:15:20,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2053
02:15:20,245 --> 02:15:21,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine being her?

2054
02:15:21,325 --> 02:15:22,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you don't remember that shit.

2055
02:15:22,386 --> 02:15:23,507
[SPEAKER_07]: She was like a year and a half.

2056
02:15:23,547 --> 02:15:24,568
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what she seems like.

2057
02:15:24,608 --> 02:15:25,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember any of this.

2058
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2059
02:15:26,209 --> 02:15:26,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess the whole.

2060
02:15:27,010 --> 02:15:27,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

2061
02:15:27,810 --> 02:15:28,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I fell down a well.

2062
02:15:29,071 --> 02:15:29,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee.

2063
02:15:31,234 --> 02:15:33,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess who's never live now.

2064
02:15:33,096 --> 02:15:33,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2065
02:15:33,476 --> 02:15:34,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the part.

2066
02:15:34,217 --> 02:15:35,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, honey.

2067
02:15:36,378 --> 02:15:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: She got like a million dollars worth of money.

2068
02:15:39,541 --> 02:15:44,645
[SPEAKER_07]: People just sent gifts, money, unsolicited, but people just sent baby Jessica college money.

2069
02:15:44,665 --> 02:15:46,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she was saying that's how she went to school.

2070
02:15:46,366 --> 02:15:48,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it all got put in a trust fund.

2071
02:15:48,728 --> 02:15:51,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say I was reading online next year or something.

2072
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:55,254
[SPEAKER_07]: She's getting like a million dollars because it's all been saved and growing and all that stuff.

2073
02:15:55,274 --> 02:15:55,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2074
02:15:55,934 --> 02:15:57,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a lesson to mothers.

2075
02:15:57,739 --> 02:16:01,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop watching your children around wells if you want them set for life.

2076
02:16:01,929 --> 02:16:04,195
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we teach here in America.

2077
02:16:05,617 --> 02:16:11,502
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you just need to have like eight kids all at once and everybody will give you tons of money for diapers and crap.

2078
02:16:11,602 --> 02:16:15,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And wear fake Dolce & Gabbana glasses and drink your Starbucks every morning.

2079
02:16:15,785 --> 02:16:16,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2080
02:16:17,247 --> 02:16:23,992
[SPEAKER_02]: But this means that now Xbox Live is servicing 35 countries at once.

2081
02:16:24,993 --> 02:16:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure gets around.

2082
02:16:26,855 --> 02:16:27,455
[SPEAKER_05]: In a row?

2083
02:16:28,116 --> 02:16:28,556
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 37, dude.

2084
02:16:28,636 --> 02:16:31,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just need to give it two more.

2085
02:16:34,669 --> 02:16:51,178
[SPEAKER_07]: it can service Luxembourg try not to service any more countries on your way to the parking lot alright if that's it for the rapid news tonight let's get to the twitter topics tweet tweet tweet tweet

2086
02:16:54,912 --> 02:16:59,596
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened to the big box stores boycotting third party Wii games that are nothing but minigames?

2087
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:19,258
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

2088
02:17:19,639 --> 02:17:20,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know anything about this, Loki?

2089
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:24,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't stores supposed to be boycotting Wii games that were nothing but mini-games?

2090
02:17:24,101 --> 02:17:25,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember hearing about this, too.

2091
02:17:25,102 --> 02:17:26,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the show.

2092
02:17:26,303 --> 02:17:27,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they do to a certain extent.

2093
02:17:27,944 --> 02:17:43,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, most stores nowadays realize that only the first-party or big third-party games are really the only things they're selling, so they're buying a lot less of the third-party games that are just crap, as they should be doing with their dollars.

2094
02:17:44,354 --> 02:17:45,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think people are...

2095
02:17:46,215 --> 02:17:46,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine Babies

2096
02:18:11,949 --> 02:18:14,030
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on to other tweets.

2097
02:18:15,391 --> 02:18:20,294
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw305 sends us some links, and I always let him get in a couple tweets here because there's good stuff.

2098
02:18:20,694 --> 02:18:21,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard this one either.

2099
02:18:21,855 --> 02:18:33,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, one of the EA developers is saying, and this is a pretty ballsy thing to say from a tweet, again, sent to us from TigerClaw, Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs.

2100
02:18:34,642 --> 02:18:35,122
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2101
02:18:36,203 --> 02:18:36,603
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2102
02:18:37,363 --> 02:18:37,884
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like...

2103
02:18:39,165 --> 02:18:45,632
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really interesting to hear because I was under the assumption that this is going to be as close to WoW as it gets.

2104
02:18:45,772 --> 02:18:46,333
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

2105
02:18:46,633 --> 02:18:50,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not talking... Again, I don't want to like... It'll be WoW without the suck.

2106
02:18:51,279 --> 02:18:52,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to make... Girl.

2107
02:18:53,081 --> 02:18:57,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to make it sound like WoW and another big MMO are capable of coexisting.

2108
02:18:58,908 --> 02:19:02,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be that this has to take away from WoW.

2109
02:19:02,592 --> 02:19:05,855
[SPEAKER_07]: But I always thought that this was really going to be the next big MMO.

2110
02:19:05,935 --> 02:19:08,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of interesting that this whole thing is coming up here.

2111
02:19:09,059 --> 02:19:11,381
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Dollar Bill says, I thought APB was the fail.

2112
02:19:11,822 --> 02:19:15,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's coming from an EA Mythic employee who's going to be laid off next month.

2113
02:19:15,606 --> 02:19:18,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And they unloaded on the division for the Old Republic.

2114
02:19:19,430 --> 02:19:19,931
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

2115
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:42,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like a 20 gig installation and most of it is voiceover work.

2116
02:19:43,234 --> 02:19:44,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best they have.

2117
02:19:44,255 --> 02:19:45,456
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest of the game is a joke.

2118
02:19:45,816 --> 02:19:47,498
[SPEAKER_07]: EA knows it and so does George Lucas.

2119
02:19:47,558 --> 02:19:54,486
[SPEAKER_07]: They're panicking and so much of Mythic has already been cannibalized to work in Austin on it because they can't keep pushing back launch.

2120
02:19:54,866 --> 02:19:58,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs from EA.

2121
02:19:58,310 --> 02:20:00,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably at the level of The Sims Online.

2122
02:20:00,172 --> 02:20:01,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know it too.

2123
02:20:01,773 --> 02:20:25,665
[SPEAKER_07]: hmm now he could just be being bitter about the whole layoff thing so take it with a grain of salt but that's that's the first like really really negative thing I've heard about it aren't they doing like top secret testing right now I want to say I heard somewhere that there is testing going on for the game right now but it's under super duper NDA lock and key so that's why you're not hearing a lot of stuff externally you think some loud mouth is going to come out and dispute this I don't know

2124
02:20:26,986 --> 02:20:34,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, one other quick story from Tiger5 They're doing it under the name Final Fantasy XIV He sent me a few, but I'm going to stick with two here

2125
02:20:34,468 --> 02:20:35,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet, tweet!

2126
02:20:35,829 --> 02:20:36,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he sent two tweets.

2127
02:20:36,689 --> 02:20:37,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet, tweet.

2128
02:20:37,630 --> 02:20:41,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Mike Tyson's punch-out has been reimagined on the iPhone.

2129
02:20:42,152 --> 02:20:43,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, ripped off.

2130
02:20:43,813 --> 02:20:44,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

2131
02:20:45,034 --> 02:20:45,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

2132
02:20:45,434 --> 02:20:47,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Software created this game.

2133
02:20:47,775 --> 02:20:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: You fight as a character named Lil Sammy, and then eventually you take on Mike Tyson.

2134
02:20:53,038 --> 02:20:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea if they actually got a license or whatever, but you go through ten fights that lead up to Tyson.

2135
02:21:00,363 --> 02:21:02,724
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is, and there's a whole little picture there.

2136
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:04,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be a better Evander Holyfield.

2137
02:21:06,567 --> 02:21:07,648
[SPEAKER_02]: You should play as little Mike.

2138
02:21:08,329 --> 02:21:11,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious if they actually have the licensing because that could be very bad for them if not.

2139
02:21:12,733 --> 02:21:14,655
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably needs the money.

2140
02:21:14,695 --> 02:21:16,076
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you can do it for $5.

2141
02:21:17,079 --> 02:21:17,479
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be.

2142
02:21:17,619 --> 02:21:18,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'll bite your ear off.

2143
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:20,581
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be 99 cents though.

2144
02:21:21,061 --> 02:21:22,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Spazinator wants to give us a heads up.

2145
02:21:22,662 --> 02:21:27,665
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a free episode of Sengoku Basara Samurai Warriors Anime on the PSN Video Store right now.

2146
02:21:27,945 --> 02:21:29,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Could that have anything to do with the game that just came out?

2147
02:21:31,147 --> 02:21:31,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

2148
02:21:32,227 --> 02:21:33,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mystery to everyone.

2149
02:21:33,894 --> 02:21:37,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here's an old-time Q&A from SSJ100Matt.

2150
02:21:37,096 --> 02:21:38,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

2151
02:21:38,096 --> 02:21:38,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet, tweet!

2152
02:21:39,057 --> 02:21:46,880
[SPEAKER_07]: With the 400th episode coming up, have you thought about getting the DDR gang back together and doing an episode at RVGL?

2153
02:21:48,308 --> 02:21:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time we did an episode of RVGL, we almost got kicked out.

2154
02:21:50,491 --> 02:21:52,774
[SPEAKER_07]: However, here's an idea I do like.

2155
02:21:52,794 --> 02:21:53,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about this, folks.

2156
02:22:05,532 --> 02:22:05,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt and Mike

2157
02:22:33,938 --> 02:22:45,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Convinced Loki Step Squad and RTF That's a good idea The old school Mount Mikes in Concord And that would be a nice middle place Because it would only be about an hour and ten minutes away from here Excellent idea

2158
02:22:46,454 --> 02:22:47,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do have good pizza.

2159
02:22:48,956 --> 02:22:49,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And decent beer.

2160
02:22:49,537 --> 02:22:50,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they still there?

2161
02:22:50,237 --> 02:22:51,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they still have DDR?

2162
02:22:51,398 --> 02:22:52,579
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I know.

2163
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:58,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to do that for the 400th episode and try to get all the old school people we can.

2164
02:22:59,085 --> 02:23:04,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be tricky on a Sunday night, but we're about 14 weeks away.

2165
02:23:04,329 --> 02:23:06,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be mid-January, I think, is when we hit 400.

2166
02:23:08,493 --> 02:23:09,294
[SPEAKER_07]: We got time to plan it.

2167
02:23:09,494 --> 02:23:12,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just my fantasy dream thing.

2168
02:23:13,297 --> 02:23:24,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing to consider is that maybe I could sweet talk a particular friend of mine who is married to another friend of mine who has a DDR solo machine in their garage.

2169
02:23:25,168 --> 02:23:26,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew who you were talking about.

2170
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:27,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Nudge, nudge.

2171
02:23:28,812 --> 02:23:30,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to talk to them separately.

2172
02:23:30,113 --> 02:23:31,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours is wired with a PlayStation in theirs.

2173
02:23:32,535 --> 02:23:33,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's still cool.

2174
02:23:33,495 --> 02:23:36,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the guts for a DDR machine, just no pads.

2175
02:23:37,176 --> 02:23:38,696
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a solo and no game.

2176
02:23:41,037 --> 02:23:43,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an idea.

2177
02:23:43,998 --> 02:23:45,798
[SPEAKER_04]: You take your thing and put it in their thing?

2178
02:23:46,178 --> 02:23:48,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you make a brand new thing!

2179
02:23:50,999 --> 02:23:58,861
[SPEAKER_05]: It's technically a Dance Maniacs J-Append, but right now it could easily be converted into a DDR machine.

2180
02:23:59,981 --> 02:24:00,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Link, link, link

2181
02:24:30,186 --> 02:24:31,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll post that in chat right now.

2182
02:24:31,266 --> 02:24:32,007
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

2183
02:24:32,767 --> 02:24:34,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So that she who is nearsighted can see it.

2184
02:24:37,168 --> 02:24:38,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That is fantastic.

2185
02:24:39,509 --> 02:24:40,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Trader Joe's.

2186
02:24:40,489 --> 02:24:40,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

2187
02:24:41,029 --> 02:24:42,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best grocery store.

2188
02:24:42,810 --> 02:24:43,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saving this.

2189
02:24:44,030 --> 02:24:47,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, lots of change on Twitter.

2190
02:24:48,292 --> 02:24:50,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not recognized that name as a tweeter in the past.

2191
02:24:50,852 --> 02:24:52,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy tweeting to you.

2192
02:24:52,913 --> 02:24:54,854
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your favorite game with Batman?

2193
02:24:58,260 --> 02:24:59,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that kind of narrows it down.

2194
02:25:01,101 --> 02:25:02,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that one game with Batman.

2195
02:25:04,542 --> 02:25:06,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to go with Arkham Asylum.

2196
02:25:06,822 --> 02:25:08,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, I like Superman 64.

2197
02:25:08,203 --> 02:25:12,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Batman even in that?

2198
02:25:13,644 --> 02:25:16,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully DC Universe... It's a joke, Loki.

2199
02:25:16,385 --> 02:25:18,006
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what we call a joke here on the show.

2200
02:25:18,066 --> 02:25:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it is a game that is in the DC Universe.

2201
02:25:24,487 --> 02:25:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that maybe Batman had a cameo in it.

2202
02:25:27,968 --> 02:25:30,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Batman and I declare that this game sucks!

2203
02:25:31,271 --> 02:25:41,238
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, if it's not going to be DC Universe Online, which I'm really hoping, the old school one on the NES, the very first one by Sunsoft, the Batman game on the NES was pretty badass.

2204
02:25:41,979 --> 02:25:46,462
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also one on the Commodore 64 that was told in a comic book style, also kind of badass.

2205
02:25:46,802 --> 02:25:49,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Bart's Nightmare, but I guess that was Bartman, not Batman.

2206
02:25:50,845 --> 02:25:51,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take it.

2207
02:25:53,467 --> 02:25:55,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of change, we'll take it and he'll like it.

2208
02:25:56,009 --> 02:25:56,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet, tweet!

2209
02:25:57,614 --> 02:25:59,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Twitter segment tonight.

2210
02:26:00,235 --> 02:26:01,036
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the tweets.

2211
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:21,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop being so fucking obscure.

2212
02:26:22,041 --> 02:26:22,421
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2213
02:26:23,341 --> 02:26:26,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I covered it on the classic game, Rob.

2214
02:26:27,442 --> 02:26:31,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2215
02:26:32,564 --> 02:26:34,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop sounding like a Japanese girl having sex.

2216
02:26:35,665 --> 02:26:36,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be...

2217
02:26:39,438 --> 02:26:41,060
[SPEAKER_04]: and now that the listeners are dead.

2218
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:44,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, you do that impression way too well, I'm just saying.

2219
02:26:44,123 --> 02:26:45,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I will tell you how I do it way too well.

2220
02:26:45,785 --> 02:26:47,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God your mic cut out, that's all I'm saying.

2221
02:26:48,208 --> 02:26:49,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you how I know how to do that.

2222
02:26:49,849 --> 02:26:55,996
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes from my dorm room with a group of us deciding to dub Rotsky Doji by ourselves.

2223
02:26:58,338 --> 02:26:58,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2224
02:26:59,259 --> 02:27:02,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And every other line was, no, don't touch me there!

2225
02:27:03,461 --> 02:27:14,788
[SPEAKER_07]: All I have to say is if we do get the cool 400th episode of The Pizza Place or wherever we have it where we get all the old school DDR people back, we need to bring in a copy of Final Fuck X. You know what, Rob?

2226
02:27:14,908 --> 02:27:16,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that recently.

2227
02:27:16,429 --> 02:27:17,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Dance Dance Fuck.

2228
02:27:18,593 --> 02:27:20,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember where that is.

2229
02:27:20,674 --> 02:27:25,576
[SPEAKER_04]: If we did do that at Mountain Mike's, they have a little side room too, so you could set up a TV in the side room.

2230
02:27:25,756 --> 02:27:28,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody stand to block the kids view.

2231
02:27:29,198 --> 02:27:29,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

2232
02:27:30,118 --> 02:27:31,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to put a red door.

2233
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:34,340
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to paint it black.

2234
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:44,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, since Iguana Girl is here with us, I'm sorry, Iguana Girl is here with us, let's do a special... That's girl, not girl.

2235
02:27:57,541 --> 02:27:58,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Your boyfriend's funny.

2236
02:28:00,783 --> 02:28:01,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do a game show.

2237
02:28:01,924 --> 02:28:03,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, an OLR game show.

2238
02:28:03,125 --> 02:28:04,206
[SPEAKER_07]: We love game shows at OLR.

2239
02:28:04,246 --> 02:28:05,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Game show!

2240
02:28:05,907 --> 02:28:07,429
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the longest running game shows.

2241
02:28:07,449 --> 02:28:08,249
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it's kind of funny.

2242
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:10,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hanging out with my friend Julie this week.

2243
02:28:10,091 --> 02:28:10,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known her for years.

2244
02:28:10,851 --> 02:28:11,732
[SPEAKER_07]: She's my ex-girlfriend.

2245
02:28:11,752 --> 02:28:12,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known her for years.

2246
02:28:13,273 --> 02:28:14,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember just after that.

2247
02:28:14,394 --> 02:28:14,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2248
02:28:15,395 --> 02:28:17,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Julie... I remember when you were straight.

2249
02:28:17,617 --> 02:28:21,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Used to be... I'm one of the only people that can say that, too.

2250
02:28:22,060 --> 02:28:23,901
[SPEAKER_07]: You were around during my bi-phase, actually.

2251
02:28:23,921 --> 02:28:24,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2252
02:28:24,582 --> 02:28:25,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

2253
02:28:26,343 --> 02:28:27,764
[SPEAKER_07]: All that stuff aside, quickly.

2254
02:28:29,045 --> 02:28:33,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Julie actually used to help me host the radio show I did in college.

2255
02:28:33,948 --> 02:28:36,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a segment we started then.

2256
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:39,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's carried over all the way until now.

2257
02:28:39,812 --> 02:28:40,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a segment we call...

2258
02:28:41,033 --> 02:28:41,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Listless!

2259
02:28:42,694 --> 02:28:43,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

2260
02:28:43,594 --> 02:28:49,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And tonight's listless topic is the thing I learned most from DDR Freak.

2261
02:28:50,578 --> 02:28:50,878
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2262
02:28:51,318 --> 02:28:52,879
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing I learned most from DDR Freak.

2263
02:28:53,299 --> 02:28:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way listless works is we're going to go around the room and we're going to get everybody's top three answers.

2264
02:28:59,422 --> 02:29:04,504
[SPEAKER_07]: But then we go around and each strike one item that is not worthy of the list.

2265
02:29:05,505 --> 02:29:07,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you guys in our chat room vote.

2266
02:29:08,426 --> 02:29:14,629
[SPEAKER_07]: and the top three is the definitive winner and there is no contesting the list once it is set in stone.

2267
02:29:14,669 --> 02:29:18,410
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very, it's a highly scientific process.

2268
02:29:18,810 --> 02:29:20,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made with uranium and shit, okay?

2269
02:29:21,291 --> 02:29:22,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how scientific this is.

2270
02:29:23,592 --> 02:29:25,153
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made with uranium and shit.

2271
02:29:25,253 --> 02:29:25,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And Uranus.

2272
02:29:26,614 --> 02:29:30,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't uranium and shit just make a big, huge, bussy puddle?

2273
02:29:30,535 --> 02:29:34,377
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd make a very sticky, smelly, but hard nuclear poo.

2274
02:29:35,037 --> 02:29:35,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuclear poo.

2275
02:29:36,398 --> 02:29:37,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Nuclear poo.

2276
02:29:37,526 --> 02:29:44,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, my boyfriend's asking in chat, what the fuck was Rob's bi-phase in an episode of Melrose Place?

2277
02:29:46,328 --> 02:29:53,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny enough, a place I used to live was referred to as Melrose Place now, and I know that.

2278
02:29:53,910 --> 02:29:55,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where that was!

2279
02:29:55,090 --> 02:29:56,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I know someone who had a bi-phase then.

2280
02:30:00,071 --> 02:30:00,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

2281
02:30:02,749 --> 02:30:06,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on and talk about other topics, please, quickly.

2282
02:30:06,572 --> 02:30:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: The prom's all red again.

2283
02:30:08,113 --> 02:30:10,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I just love bringing up old dramas like 10 years old.

2284
02:30:10,976 --> 02:30:11,296
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2285
02:30:11,896 --> 02:30:16,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is humorous because I'm actually like friends with one of the old parties again.

2286
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:17,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

2287
02:30:17,821 --> 02:30:18,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2288
02:30:18,701 --> 02:30:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good times.

2289
02:30:19,282 --> 02:30:19,902
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that going?

2290
02:30:20,443 --> 02:30:20,823
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

2291
02:30:20,863 --> 02:30:21,504
