00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tonight, October 17th, 2010, fans petition for a new Bomani game release, the developers of Game Room are set to close, and Blizzard takes the enablers of cheating to court.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that show dedicated to video games and gaming and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You know, we're that show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I apparently fail at boiling water.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's bad. That means you're not going to be able to cook anything if you can't boil water.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're going to be in my league where it's like Hot Pockets and Easy Mac and Cheese.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I was making fake coffee for my French press and didn't boil enough water, so I'm boiling more water.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You fail at boiling water. That should be a losing screen in some... boil water the game, I don't know.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Next in Cooking Mama, it's Boiling Mama.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Say hello, but don't boil mama. That would be an M-rated game.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alright, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How you doing, Loki?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Good.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you eating and talking on a radio show at the same time?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, I am.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Shame on you. You're violating every single good rule of radio. What are you eating over there, sir?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Triple bacon pizza.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So let's see, last week it was double bacon pizza, and I seem to distinctly remember the one and only Loki saying something about,

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Triple bacon pizza is too much bacon.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can't remember if it did triple or quadruple, so I'm testing both.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I almost said quadruple today, but I was like, ehhh, ramp it up slowly.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's really good, actually.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I just want to point out, I have a terrible Loki impersonation.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's triple bacon pizza. I don't know what I'm doing.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hi. Also say hello. We have a very special guest tonight. I promised this last week.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you haven't heard the podcast, though, we do have a very special guest.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You could call it a little bit of All Games Cross promotion, in a way, because we have here live in studio, not on Skype,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but here live in studio all the way from Under Sedation Live. Say hello to Jessica Harper.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hello, people. Yes, I'm actually sitting on the floor.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, as opposed to on the toilet.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As opposed to on the toilet, which is where I usually am right before the show.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How are you, lovely Jessica?

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I am doing just fabulously, and yeah, it's kind of cool to have, like, we had our All Games moment just a few minutes ago,

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
where it was Bobby Black Wolf and OLR and Under Sedation Live all in one little happy family right there.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So that was kind of cool.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Absolutely. So while Jessica brought it up, let me get that out there.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And if you are listening live, make sure you join us in our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You think that's everything? I think that's good.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, Jessica Harper, you might know her online as Iguana Girl.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And that's because you are actually an iguana?

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, actually, yes. In the middle of the night, I just have these moments where I turn green,

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and I don't turn into the Hulk, I just turn into an iguana.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, actually, the nickname originally was given to me by friends because I had an obsession with iguanas.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I had an iguana at the time, and Girl, G-R-R-L, was because I was always the video gamer geek

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
out of all of the boys that worked over at this ISP, the internet service provider that we were at.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I was the girl. I wasn't totally, you know, frilly and prissy and all that.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now, see, I always thought it might have been a, hey, girl, type of thing, but I guess that's G-U-R.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because when Alan types in an email to me, he'll say G-U-R-R-L.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, no, mine was more, you know, the female empowerment grrr.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Grrr. Okay.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want a smash.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It just kind of stuck, and I've been using that nickname since, like, 97 now, I think.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Awesome.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So, yeah, just always been that way.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright. Well, Jessica's here tonight for, you know, well, obviously, we've been doing this show forever,

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and she's never sat in. I don't think you, well, maybe, it's been a long time if you have.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We've done top tens.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe like a long time ago, but it's definitely been several years since you've been here in the studio with us.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, yeah, I think the last time I was probably back at your place, like, in Rancho.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, we were doing the crossover stuff for DDR Free Radio, and I was like, hey, our shows can get along. It's great. We're having fun.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Didn't we do the top ten Bimani songs of that year?

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, I remember going on to Folsom.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, yeah, I think we take the show or something.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Anyway, regardless, it's been a heck of a long time since Jessica's been on the show,

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
which is kind of bittersweet in a way because Jessica and I kind of started, in a way, a lot of our internet radio stuffs together

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
over on Undersedation Live when the head honcho over there, Travis, used to live out here.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, and I'm back, bitches.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The HBIC for Undersedation Live. Travis used to live out here in SAC, and Jessica, myself, and Travis were all kind of the start of that show.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So this show, in a way, Orange Haunts Radio, in a way, I don't want Travis' ego to get too big if he's listening, but in a way...

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In a way, please.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, it is. It's a spinoff of Undersedation Live.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, because you started OLR pretty soon. I think we were right in tandem with DDR Freak Radio and OLR.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, which is funny because it was one of those, like, we weren't comparing notes things because Jessica and I were on a break at that time.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We could get into some of the fun stuff later if we wanted.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, no, no, no. That was before the break break because we were still doing US Altogether and we were still getting along, but it was before that.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Right. But, you know, I think I mentioned this during the marathon show or something, like, you know, it's kind of, you know, funny the way things work sometimes because obviously this is ten years ago,

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and at this time, you know, we're in our 20s and just very different and there was a lot of stuff going on and a lot of...

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was personally looking back in a very toxic situation at the time that didn't bode itself well to the future and, you know, things happen and unfortunately Jessica and I kind of...

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We had a little break up for a while, but we're cool now and I think it's great that she's back in the radio business and I've listened to a few episodes of Undersedation Live.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Whether Travis knows it or not, I really do listen once in a while when I can. I know, I know.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm in a tie of shock.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I know, I know. I know all the smack he's talking about me over there. I don't think I don't know.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But, yeah, no, I think it's great. I think it's just awesome.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You see, what I should have done is I should have made him play the voicemail.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Considering that that voicemail was recorded during that same trip where you played DDR for the first time.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's true and I don't have a copy of that.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, Travis, if you're listening, if you want to, you know, later on when we're taking calls...

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And the voicemail she's referring to is...

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll be back.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I guess we should tell this story real quick. We will get into the gaming news and all that stuff in a little bit.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But the way Jessica and I kind of got into DDR in the first place, and if it wasn't for DDR, I would probably not have ultimately met Dark Soccer and Loki, at least in the way that I did.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But the way Jessica and I got into DDR in the beginning is that we went to the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Picture Show convention and then we just...

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What happened? We just kind of said, screw it, to the convention one night, right?

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We just decided that we were going to go hit some arcades because we were bored out of our minds and there was this 1.5 machine.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right. This machine that was flashing and it was saying, I'm playing Super Gay Music. Come play. It's fun.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Super Gay Music. And Rob went like a fly. You know, like a moth to a flame.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Exactly. It was fun.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But yeah, you know, it's like, oh, it has a pad and I wonder what we're supposed to do.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What ultimately drew you to the machine though? You couldn't be the Uber Gay Music. You must have just been like, it's colors.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I guess I had a new shiny moment. I'm guessing, you know.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But yeah. And what was our first song? You remember?

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want to say it had to have been the one star, Have You Never Been Mellow.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Do we pump it up to Boom Boom Dollar?

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We went Boom Boom Dollar first and we failed.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And then we proceeded to go right back and go, okay, well maybe we should try this again, but let's do it on an easier level.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then we ended up doing Butterfly. And then once we beat Butterfly, we went back to Boom Boom Dollar and I think we ended up beating it the second time.

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think there was a little bit of ego there because I remember we used to play the old Busta, here in the US it was Busta Groove.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But of course that drives Jamie bonkers because overseas it was Busta Move. But we didn't know any better at the time because we were just like, ooh, flashy.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But we used to play those games and really liked it. So we were like, oh, we're the masters at Busta Move or Busta Groove. We'll kick this thing's ass. And it's like, boom, failed.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I remember going to your old apartment and playing on that one pad that was for some Disney game.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Or like some child's.

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought it was like a Britney's dance pad or something.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The very first, before DDR was on PlayStation 1, they actually released a Disney's Jungle Book Jungle Groove game.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And it came with this dance pad that was probably made for a seven year old.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And it was a cheap little dance game that I think was really just existed to beat DDR to the market.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But it had some funny Jungle Book songs on it.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It was cute.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want to walk like you, talk like you too. You know, you could kind of dance to it. It was cute.

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And then Dark Sakura, she was kind of like, by this time we knew her and she was kind of like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You need a little plug in the back and you need to burn a copy of Thursday. I'm coming over.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was like, Rob, get me a paperclip.

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Back in those days when you could do the single swap, which I never learned how to do anything but the single swap.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was like, screw it. I'll just get this little thing and plug it in.

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
See, I was lucky. I actually got to have mine professionally, semi-professionally modded by Brad.

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then I remember a bunch of folks came over one night. I think it was the first night we were playing third mix.

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And weren't you fortunate enough not to have downstairs neighbors at the time?

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Or at least if I didn't have a downstairs neighbor, she didn't complain at all.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I do remember you freaking out going, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, yeah, because our friend at the time, Eric, was this very tall, very skinny dude.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I remember he was like, I'm going to pump it up to like a six footer or something and play on this little jungle beat dance mat thing.

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And it was like, really funny. So good times. Good memories.

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I remember a later Las Vegas trip that you and I took where we went to that same DDR machine.

145
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yep. Very drunk. Oh, yes. And called Rob.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Actually, it wasn't exactly the same because it was a fourth or a fourth plus.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, we went to one at Circus Circus. Yeah, but there was a fourth or a fourth plus at the time.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's it. They had removed the 1.5 and they moved it to the front of that same arcade area.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because for those who don't know, Circus Circus in Vegas has like five billion arcades to it. Seriously.

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And there's like one arcade where we ended up finding a karaoke machine, but that's, you know, a different story for Travis to find the music.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's a whole nother episode and that'll probably be on Understation Live when Travis is like, hmm, let's make an ass of Rob this week again.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I got me a car. Okay.

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Sounds like you leave them so many opportunities.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You know what? What can I say? I was young and dumb in my 20s and I'm young and dumb now.

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, bye.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have like a whole list of Rob quotes that go through my head.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm surprised there's not a Rob soundboard that Travis is in.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You know, we actually considered it.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I remember my favorite...

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Mic fail. Mic fail. Boop, boop, mic fail.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hey! Better?

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was going to stop and get you a cord. If I hadn't driven five hours today, I was going to stop and get you a cord.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I remember a trip to, um, Miggle. No, it wasn't. It was, uh, Sunnyvale Golf Land where I was drinking out of the Pepsi bone and I gave Rob a drink and he gave it back to me.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And right when I'm drinking, Rob says, by the way, I have gay.

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You cut out right as you said that.

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, shit.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Your mic sucks. I hate it.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's not the mic. It's the cord.

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But, no, I let Rob take a drink out of my big Pepsi bone and then I took it back to take a drink and Rob says, by the way, I have gay.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That was the best ever.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Good times.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No, your mic, you got to... I don't...

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Ah!

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We might have to play mic pass around or something tonight.

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Alright, yeah, well, of course that really annoying thing works.

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Alright, look, let's, uh, let's start off the show finally with talking a little bit about our gaming weeks and some of the other stuff outside of DDR that we've been playing.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Um, let's start with Dark Soccer as we always do. How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I played your Final Fantasy XIII game thingy with a controller that was still charging and I have a complaint about the PlayStation charging controller thing.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The little micro USB cable thing. It's too damn short. Seriously, do people in Japan have no room in their par...

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, I guess they don't.

181
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Um, so I played some Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they totally stole the ship and with the Shiva sisters who are sexy.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And, dude, they turned into a freakin' bike.

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
OMG, spoilers.

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't care.

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They're scissoring and they're a bike at the same time.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ah, that's hot. Anyway, um, I also played lots of Star Trek Online. Um, I didn't have a whole lot of time last week for games because, uh, things are really cracking down.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You know, I'm on the American River Review magazine class. Oh my god.

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So, um, when I wasn't pulling out my hair over my deadlines, I was also playing, um, Star Trek Online and I finally got my Breen.

189
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And you can't really change the way they look or anything because the Breen wear this, like, suit that keeps it, you know, zero degrees cold inside because they all want to look like, you know, Princess Leia in her, uh, outfit from when she went to rescue Han Solo.

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Um, so anyway, and I played, uh, lots of Plants vs. Zombies. Duh.

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I played, um, I tried Narbacular Drop again. It's still confusing as hell.

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And, uh, as thing is about, yes, I have a grudge. Mud.

194
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
For the record, I watched three Ju-On movies also during the course of, um, yesterday and the day before.

195
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And they were fantastic, as always.

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And Darcy is responding to comments in our chat room at chat.orangehelsiority.com.

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, because I can make the grudge noise.

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
She doesn't have Tourette's. She's just...

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
My little side giggle was because I saw that Travis was saying something.

200
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh god, did he join chat? Uh oh.

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes, he did.

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Uh oh, he says, I will torment all. Uh oh.

203
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Uh oh.

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Which means he's probably recording the whole show tonight to snip out the really bad and, and, uh, horrible sounding parts.

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And he'll string it all together and make it sound like, you know, I said something like, well, something really bad.

206
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Because if I say it now, then he'll cut it out.

207
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And Spazinator, for the record, um, I actually don't have a micro USB extension, so it didn't work.

208
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And, um, I also...

209
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you have USB extension cables you can get?

210
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I know, but I was busy playing the game last night in my pajamas.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I am not one of those people who goes to Walmart in my pajamas.

212
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But you should have a fully charged controller.

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And I didn't want to use a hub because the only hub that I have is my TARDIS hub that was a gift to me from the lovely Tiara.

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And my TARDIS stub, my TARDIS stub hub stays firmly attached to my computer.

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But it makes TARDIS noise when you plug it in.

216
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I have a couple of friends that have that, it's cute.

217
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Alright, is that it for your gaming week?

218
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Sonic screwdriver doesn't work though.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, boo hoo, cry, sad.

221
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Loki, hey, how was your gaming week?

222
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Um, I didn't play a whole lot. I played a lot of iPad games, or iPod games, I guess.

223
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I keep wanting to call it an iPhone, but, I mean, it's the same damn thing.

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
How about iOS? Because that's the universal system they run on.

225
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay, yeah, I can do iOS.

226
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So, iOS games.

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I actually downloaded Bookworm.

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I swear, my co-worker, you know, downloads shit and he's like, he's all,

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
yeah, I got this game, but I'm like, ooh, I gotta get that. I don't know why.

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But yeah, I jumped on the Bookworm train good ten years late.

231
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And, um, yeah, it's pretty fun.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And played quite a bit of that.

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Actually, my wife was playing it at the same time on her iPod.

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So, that was fun.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And then, I've been playing a lot of Climber, which is just this free game that you can get

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
where you have this grappling hook that you launch yourself into the sky with.

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So, it's not like Crazy Climber.

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No, not like Crazy Climber.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But it's pretty cool. It's got some pretty epic music.

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And then, speaking of epic games...

241
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Not as epic as Robot Unicorn Attack, which I also played. Sorry.

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, the Heavy Metal Edition.

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They have taken the game and made it that much better.

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, I saw that.

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I actually played that while I was waiting for my pizza to be done.

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Did they add fire?

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There is fire in that.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, they did make it better.

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That was the first time I played it.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was like, there's only one awesome thing this game is missing, and that's fire.

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's got lots of skulls.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It has mountains with earthworm-type tentacle things coming out of it.

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's got, you know, pentagrams.

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's gonna be awesome.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is that it?

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Best 99 cents ever.

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Put that away right now.

258
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Anything else you played this week?

259
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hey John, we're calling to you.

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, more of that, of course.

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No, but seriously, I don't know if you've heard the song yet that's in this game, and I will pull it up real quick.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hopefully it's really loud.

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let me read some comments from chat while you're doing that.

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's see. Loomis has a suggestion in our chat room.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.

266
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Did you hear that, DarkSakura? Loomis in our chat room?

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.

268
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I know that, but I wanted to play and both of my controllers were dead.

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You need to be proactive, young lady.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Alright, here's a brief snippet of the song.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That doesn't sound very heavy metal. It sounded all like...

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is like a Dragon Force song or something.

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Seriously?

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's so awesome.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Rob, I have one thing to say to you.

276
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What? I hate you.

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Mud in our chat room says I'm pronouncing it wrong. It's I-O-S, I think is what he's trying to say.

278
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I-O-S. I don't like I-O-S. I like I-O-S.

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It makes it sound like GLaDOS.

280
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It makes it sound like I-DOS.

281
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
A little bit. Oh, whatever.

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's potato-potato to me. I think it's all the same. I don't know.

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There you go. chat.orangelandrater.com.

284
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Salacious Pop says Bookworm in Bookworm Adventures is awesome, except for when it gets really hard and makes you feel stupid.

285
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, they're dropping a bunch of letters that were on fire and it's like Z, Q, U. I'm like, thanks! Love that!

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I could make Ziklicka!

287
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What am I gonna spell with Q, U, V, Z?

288
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Quijibo.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it's like, and Nellie's like, I got to level 15. I'm like, I'm on level 12 with eight letters that I can't use all on fire.

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's when you start looking for ass every single time. Ass, ass.

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ass, ass, ass. That's what I do. Play dirty words.

292
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
May I also point, speaking of words, may I point out a travesty against humanity?

293
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

294
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Lexulus no longer has Solitaire Mode. I'm pissed off. Okay, you can continue.

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And apparently the word dong is not an acceptable word in there, because I had that and I could have knew.

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
See, that's what we need. We need the sexualized version of Bookworm.

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, if they did Words with Friends Pirate Edition, I don't see why they don't do Words with Friends Sexy Edition.

298
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
See, this is where I have my problems, because they have a Blackberry.

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They don't have like a Words with Friends Z Clone thing?

300
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No. Hell no.

301
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Because it doesn't matter, because who am I going to do that with? Everybody else has a freaking iPhone.

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But some of it crosses over. Like, uh, well, there's the, uh, what is it?

303
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Open Faint. That's right, that's the network.

304
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Which, I gotta admit, you know, there is, let me put it this way, I have two folders of games that are all Open Faint compatible.

305
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I have half a folder of Game Center stuff. That should say something to you, Apple, that perhaps your Game Center is a little too little too late.

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Too late. You know what, on my iPhone, you know what I play that's Open Faint enabled more than anything else? The Commodore 64 collection that they have on the iPhone.

307
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That is so unsurprising.

308
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, Loki.

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That is it.

310
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then let me move on to the lovely Jessica Harper over here. Now, since it's your first time on the show in a very long time, let me, let me just kind of ask the starting question we usually do, and that is, what kind of gamer are you?

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You know, because every gamer likes, you know, some people like sports games, some people like the music games. What kind of games are your favorite?

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, um, I am, I'm currently a mostly an active gamer, unfortunately. Due to circumstances regarding the relationship that I just came from, I had to sell off a lot of my systems.

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So that pretty much leaves me with my computer that's sub-par for gaming. It's my little appy, and I have a PS2, and that's it.

314
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But primarily when it comes to games, I have a tendency to, I like to go towards puzzle games. I like Final Fantasy style, RPG, blah blah blah.

315
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I used to be big into first person shooters. That was a really big thing for me when I first started gaming. I used to like to piss off the boys by, you know, fragging them constantly.

316
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You used to be like a Doom 2 girl, huh?

317
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was a Quake 2 girl.

318
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I used to actually go to a place that was here in Sacramento, actually in Citrus Heights, called Cosmic Drip Cyber Cafe.

319
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That was the thing over behind the 7-Eleven, wasn't it? I know that place!

320
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, and one of the first things they did is they offered $40 for 40 hours of play, which was pretty damn awesome when you figured out how much I actually used it.

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I used to sit there for 4, 5, 6 hours each night, just hanging out, drinking my Jolt Cola, and fragging the boys.

322
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Good times.

323
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Do you have a particular favorite game, besides the DDR and 2DX we've been reminiscing about, do you have a favorite game?

324
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm not putting you on the spot a little bit, but I'm sorry.

325
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Typing of the Dead.

326
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Typing of the Dead is up there. I'd probably get thrown out of the club if I said Final Fantasy 7.

327
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't think there's anything wrong with Final Fantasy 7, love.

328
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I get thrown out of the club.

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, please. This is a safe house.

330
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Final Fantasy 9.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If you said Final Fantasy 14, I might have an issue.

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, see, again, I haven't been able to game much. I work too dang much, so I don't get to sit down. Lately, my main game of choice? Price is right on Facebook.

333
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You know, Rob, they do have a free trial to Final Fantasy 14.

334
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'd heard there's this whole free trial, and I gotta really stop hating on Final Fantasy 14, because I didn't play it outside the beta, so I'm not being fair. I'm only going off of what I heard.

335
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And everything I've heard kind of collaborates with my experience with the beta, so I feel a little justified, but I am being a hater, I guess.

336
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll try it out.

337
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Please do. I would love to hear your review on this game.

338
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We should be recording while I play it.

339
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You get some interesting new expletives to add to this show.

340
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Who else is pissed off that they renamed all the races? It makes no sense.

341
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, we're gonna give them different names. They're different races, even though they're exactly the same.

342
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I gotta read this comment from chat too, because SalaciousPop I think is right on the money here.

343
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Sky will stop the show if she says Final Fantasy 8.

344
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I might have thrown her out if she said 8 was her favorite.

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No, no, no, no.

346
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's not bad.

347
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's not bad.

348
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Here's the thing, and I've even told Alan this, I kind of play up my hate for 8 on the show a little bit.

349
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Dude, gun blades! It's a sword and a gun together!

350
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But I really hated the whole magic drawing thing. It really ruined the game for me.

351
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I don't remember that. I must have blocked it out.

352
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But it did have a good story. I will agree with you.

353
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And the fact that it had the full screen battles as opposed to Final Fantasy 7's crop thing, that was neat.

354
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It did have its technological advances, so I will concede on some points, but it still sucks.

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Well, if there's nothing else Jessica wants to share?

356
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Video gaming wise, that's usually the part of the show on USL where I go silent and just let the boys play.

357
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Eventually I'll get an Xbox and start getting back into the swing of things.

358
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Awesome. I hope maybe with some of the price drops that are rumored, either this holiday or next holiday,

359
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
it'll be really easy for you to get either a Wii or a 360 and you can kind of pick right back up.

360
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, it would be a 360.

361
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
360 would use the refurbisher down like $109.

362
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, pretty soon, within the next month or two.

363
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You should definitely ask Sandy Claws for one. You never know.

364
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Alright, let me talk about Miami EME Wii, which is actually kind of short.

365
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't have a whole lot to advertise because World of Warcraft dominates a lot of things.

366
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But I did play a couple of new things. I played Sonic 4 for a little bit.

367
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And I can sort of see where Loki was disappointed in last week's review.

368
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And if you didn't hear his thing on Sonic 4, go listen to last week's.

369
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I didn't like some of Sonic's controls.

370
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I felt like the whole acceleration part of Sonic felt really broken to me.

371
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Like the 0 to 60, if you'll call it, was really weird for me.

372
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Here's my thing too, and this is not just a Sonic complaint.

373
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This is kind of a complaint of a lot of games that are coming out now.

374
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You don't need to make everything polygons.

375
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You can stick with the sprites and they can still be good.

376
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You don't have to make it all polygons because, honestly, it looks a little weird.

377
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Um, it was okay. I didn't mind the graphics, actually.

378
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It looked like a souped up version of Sonic 2.

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Which also, in a way, though, was kind of my problem with it.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It really didn't, at least in those first few levels.

381
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Granted, I understand the later levels are going to be a different kind of game.

382
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But I kind of felt like it was just an HD version of Sonic 2 in the beginning with a different level layout.

383
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Which, you know, take it or leave it. Retro-tastic is kind of where it's at.

384
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I think a lot of companies are trying to find the right place to be with retro games.

385
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Like, Mega Man 9 definitely tickled a lot of people for the happy...

386
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Look at Capcom. They're doing it right.

387
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But I don't know. I don't know if, necessarily, Mega Man 10 was really the right step.

388
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I actually was a little disappointed in Mega Man 10, simply because Mega Man 10...

389
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I expected that Mega Man 10 was going to be this epic, epicness, tenth Mega...

390
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I think Mega Man Universe and what's happening there is what I was expecting for Mega Man 10.

391
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Mega Man 10, as we got it, felt like Mega Man 9 Part 2.

392
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If that makes any sense at all.

393
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Which, yes, I understand. They're all... The old games are kind of like that.

394
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't know. I just expected the level of epicness to be raised rather than,

395
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
we're going to get away with the same joke that we did with Mega Man 9.

396
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else.

397
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Done once, it's brilliant. Done twice, it's a gimmick.

398
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Exactly. Exactly right. That's kind of where I was at with it.

399
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
See, what I would want to see is instead of them doing what they did with 10,

400
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
if they did like a new X and made it all SNES-tastic.

401
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, that would have been like at least a slightly different gimmick and would have been kind of cool.

402
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But whatever, it is what it is. It's not like a bad game.

403
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's just, you know, it was a little more forgettable than 9 because it felt like the same joke as 9 all over again.

404
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But anyway, how did I get from Sonic 4 to Mega Man? Oh well, whatever. I guess this whole retro thing.

405
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I think in a way, maybe it does relate because in a way that's where Sonic 4 lost some of its magic for me.

406
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Is that we've already seen Sonic on Xbox Live Arcade. We've already seen the Sonic 2.

407
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So it's kind of like to get the Sonic 4 and have it just be kind of like, oh well now it's the HD graphics.

408
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And even when it's the HD graphics, it really doesn't, it just feels like a sharper Sonic 2 if you will.

409
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You know what I mean? I don't know.

410
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But of course, there's gonna be the hardcore Sonic fans that are just gonna eat it up and that's good.

411
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
However, you gotta admit, it is a little dumpy of them to be doing this whole splitting it up into the episodes to get more money out of it in the long run thing.

412
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I do think, especially now having played it, that was kind of a tacky move.

413
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I think it's one that's gonna come bite them when it comes to the sales of episode 2.

414
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But we'll see. Prove me wrong, Sonic fans. We'll see.

415
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Otherwise, the only other game I checked out was on the iPhone and I totally deserved to get teased and made fun of and called names for this.

416
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But I was checking out free games on Game Center and all this and I downloaded a game called Pocket Frogs.

417
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What?

418
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's called Pocket Frogs and it's a game you breed frogs and you breed them.

419
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You might have a purple frog with green spots and you made it with a white frog and you might get a purple frog with white spots.

420
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You from Easy Vibe is the pocket frog.

421
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Is this like Derby Owners Club for frogs?

422
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But you don't race them. You jump them around on lily pads.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You eat flies and that's really all you ever do with them. You can't combat against friends or anything.

424
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So I will freely admit, this game is fucking stupid. I don't know why I keep playing it.

425
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's like this obsessive need to collect bullshit. This is like a hoarder's dream right here, this game.

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But in my defense, it was completely free.

427
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
New show, E Hoarder, starring Rob Roberts.

428
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Seriously?

429
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I had to remove a bunch of apps off of my iPod because I've actually maxed out the memory. I had like 6.5 gigs worth of apps on there.

430
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Of course a lot of them were like those 400 gig apps like the Monkey Island games.

431
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Multiple folks in chat are saying so it's chocobo breeding. Yeah, it's kind of like the chocobo breeding in a way.

432
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Except you can't fly your chocobo over the mountains.

433
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And land in the giant crater so that you can get the materia.

434
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There are pay parts to this game and that is like if you want to use like a growth potion to make your frog egg grow instantly and not have to wait 30 minutes, you can pay like 99 cents.

435
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Or you can get the mail to move fat. Like if all this like impatient people bullshit I can't believe anybody would spend money on but I guess they're making money off it somehow.

436
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can pay for that. I am happy to say I have not paid one cent towards this game and if I do, you can slap me. Okay?

437
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll remember that. I'll remember that next time you buy something on WoW.

438
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
No, hold on. Girl that is different. It is not.

439
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
If I get the collector's edition of WoW to get my little death wing that is a different story.

440
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Actually Rob, I bought a pet on Star Trek Online. It's like a giant Vulcan cat. It's cute! And I bought tribbles.

441
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,000
ActDeafed in our chatroom says Rob, you basically defended all FarmVille players all over the world. No, because FarmVille is lame.

442
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Speaking of which, I am currently on dog sitting duty for my mom's FarmVille account.

443
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Wait, wait. You got to explain this. Hold on. Is your mom like super addicted to FarmVille?

444
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:48,000
My mom is super addicted to FarmVille, FrontierVille, that Treasure Island one, all that crap. And she has this farm full of animals and she is insisting that I watch her dogs. I have to feed her dogs because she's on vacation for a week.

445
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I wonder if there's actually some sort of money to be made for a service like that. You know what I mean?

446
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Remember Neopets and how you could just put them in the kennel? They should have something like that.

447
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Seriously. I think a couple of them do. Hire the immigrant workers? I wouldn't mind hiring some from a damn hotel. I'm sorry, I don't play Hotel City or anything.

448
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Ray Iannami in our chatroom says just shut down her accounts while she's gone. It's an intervention. Burn it to the ground!

449
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'd love to, but I would probably not have a mother after that. Then it would be like, you know, hey, this is Rob Roberts on CBS 13 and Jessica Harper was found dead this evening. Strangled to death by your mother.

450
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I shouldn't feel any pressure here, but she's like, if you don't feed them every single day, they're going to die. They're going to run away. They're not going to want to be part of my farm anymore. I'm like, okay, mom, I'll feed your stupid dogs.

451
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That sounds like my mother.

452
00:32:46,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And she's on Facebook all the time saying, I didn't get my treat basket! Where's my treat basket? Except, you know, in much more of a Southern accent. Y'all, I can't find my treat basket!

453
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I am so glad that my mother, she doesn't play that shit. Well, she stalks people on Twitter. That's what she does. Instead of getting into Farmville and all that stuff, she just reads my Twitter and then calls me and says, what is this about? Why did you tweet about this?

454
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, I actually just posted something on Facebook a couple days ago that was, you know, the anti-parental tool for Facebook. It was, you know, an SNL skit and I posted it up. I'm like, so mom, do I need this?

455
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Basically, it's like talking about how, well, do you post things that your mom doesn't want to see? And it shows pictures of like him doing, you know, smoking a bong and what have you.

456
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And apparently this tool is supposed to make everything all better and it turns the bong into like a saxophone and turns him drinking beer into like, I need to go buy some dungarees!

457
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We'll have to find it later on on Break or something so you guys can play it because it's pretty humorous.

458
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
We'll look for it. Awesome, awesome. Alright, well that's going to do it for my gaming week. I don't want to talk about a whole lot of other stuff so let's get into some other stuff tonight.

459
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Housekeeping, don't have a whole lot to add here. Are we doing a show on Halloween? That's one thing I've got to figure out.

460
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'd rather not. I thought we were going to go to the Winchester Mystery House.

461
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, I've got to work the next day. That's my problem. Stupid words.

462
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't know, I've been to the Winchester Mystery House. You should tell them that you celebrated a religious holiday and that you're exhausted from carousing.

463
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Instead it'll be boring in the dark.

464
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well we'll see, I don't know. I love the Winchester Mystery House.

465
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
We will probably pre-tape, I'm going to imagine, that week. So we'll work something out. That sound right guys? We'll probably pre-tape that week.

466
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Pre-tape sounds fine. But we won't be here on Halloween night itself. Otherwise it shows us on schedule as usual.

467
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And of course follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R, speaking of if you want to be like my mom. My mom doesn't know about the O-L-R, I don't think.

468
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And you can follow us on Facebook. Now she does! Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

469
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I was going to mention one part of my gaming week, I got a new laptop. And it's awesome. It's an Asus G60JX, which is just a Core i5 PC.

470
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Core i5s are weird. Actually all those new core systems with the hypothetical threads and, oh we only overclock your system when it's not running hot and that kind of stuff.

471
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Strange. But hey, it runs Grand Theft Auto. That's all I really needed to do.

472
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Does that complete your life? It does. For now.

473
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Our pal Bobby Blackwolf from before us here at Orange Lounge Radio says he will be doing a show because they don't get any trick-or-treaters where he's at.

474
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I am the trick-or-treater. That's why we're not having a show. But that's okay. Bobby will be doing his marathon show on Halloween.

475
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I've learned something about, Rob, since I've become a Jew I've learned something about Halloween. You go shopping for costumes after Halloween so you can use them for porn.

476
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm actually deciding between two costumes right now.

477
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm sure you could use them for porn too. I guess my Star Trek uniform would be good for sci-fi porn.

478
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Seriously, we went to a party USA or whatever, it's like this big ol' party store, they have tons of costumes and stuff. Or party city, whatever.

479
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
See, we wanted to get Josh a Darth Vader costume. That would be great. That would just be so awesome.

480
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
No, we couldn't do that. I can't believe you're gonna dress your baby up as Darth Vader. You know what would be great?

481
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
We almost gave him the middle name, Vader. They don't call him Master Vader.

482
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No, no, no. Put him in a brown onesie and he could be Darth Tater.

483
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Darth Tater? Not bad. No, but anyways, there was a wall of sexy costumes that they had.

484
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
For babies?

485
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No, not for babies.

486
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm gonna get you a pedobear costume.

487
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Dude, that would be awesome to dress him up like Pedobear.

488
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You're gonna dress a baby up as Pedobear?

489
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That would be hilarious.

490
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No, we're not.

491
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm calling CPS right now.

492
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I would contribute to the baby pedobear fund.

493
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No, that would be funny. No, actually, I think that they are...

494
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
She had a costume for him that her mom bought him. I think it was a bear, but it wasn't Pedobear.

495
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They just don't sell those.

496
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
No, but they have a wall of sexy costumes. It's ridiculous stuff.

497
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Optimus Prime. Sexy Optimus Prime. I'm sorry, it's just weird.

498
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I've seen sexy Chewbacca recently.

499
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Sexy Brian the dog. It's like, no, that does not need to be sexy.

500
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Spongebob. I mean, it's like, what?

501
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Spongebob. I mean, seriously, I guess, you know...

502
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Spongebob, no pants?

503
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The demand for slutty costumes is great, I guess, you know, and maybe there's women that love Optimus Prime and love loose sex.

504
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
New vibrator attachment for your transparent socks?

505
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Only if she makes the wah-wah-wah-wah noise.

506
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
All right, chatroom, chat.orangewise.com.

507
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Tigerclaw says, Loki should dress his baby as Mario to match his bedroom.

508
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You know, a toad costume would be cute, though.

509
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Aww, that would be cute.

510
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We've been thinking about that because he has the wonderful mushroom hat that my coworker got.

511
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
There you go.

512
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So we could do that. I threw out Mario as an idea.

513
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't know, we haven't really decided yet, but she doesn't want to buy costumes because they're not really expensive.

514
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But he's only going to wear them once, and a lot of the costumes that they have for babies are really fucking warm.

515
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And because he's inside, I mean, he's going to be bacon in that thing.

516
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And they're all polyester and stuff.

517
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Because they have, like, a hot dog costume, which is really funny.

518
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You know what would be great?

519
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
The Starman.

520
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, the little star.

521
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Wasn't Maggie in an episode of The Simpsons dressed up as a star?

522
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I didn't even remember that.

523
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I used to love The Simpsons back when it was first on.

524
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,000
See, that's the great thing about babies, because you can dress them in, you know, embarrassing outfits, and they don't really understand until they're 18 and you get out the pictures.

525
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I was thinking 10.

526
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You've seen on Facebook where my mother posted pictures of me and my brothers in our old Halloween costumes.

527
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Oh, yes. Good times.

528
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
My brother was a popple.

529
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I sort of remember what a popple is.

530
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
What were you?

531
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Jane of the Jungle.

532
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I was wearing that leopard print thing.

533
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Alright, Jane of the Jungle.

534
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We're going to get into some news in a little bit.

535
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Wait, I want to ask you, though, quickly, and then I want to ask Jessica another question to do some more reminiscing about the DDR days.

536
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But I want to ask you feedback on Halloween costume, because I know I'm emceeing a Rocky show either Friday or Saturday. I think I'm doing it Friday.

537
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm going to be doing that, so I need a costume for that.

538
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So I'm deciding between two.

539
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I want to dress up as a cheerleader from Glee, but then...

540
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

541
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And so I can come out on stage and say, hey, I look for my Halloween costume. I'm a cheerleader from Glee.

542
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And then turn around and I'll have a bunch of bullet holes in my back and say, that is fantastic, after the Rocky episode aired.

543
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I would go for that, because normally, you know, I can't stay on the show.

544
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Okay, then here's my other thing, is that my second choice is that I want to dress up as Allison from Intervention.

545
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
She was the girl that inhaled the computer duster. It's like I'm walking on sunshine!

546
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And I'm thinking of that, too, and I can't decide.

547
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Would people get it, though?

548
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
If I had the computer duster and said that a lot, they might.

549
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm still taking submissions, though. I need some good ideas.

550
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You could be towel-y.

551
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Towel-y? Just get a big giant towel and put it over your head.

552
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
People might take that the wrong way and call me a racist. I don't know about that.

553
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Towel-y? From South Park, right?

554
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah. How would they call you a racist?

555
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You don't have to roll it up into a cone for your head.

556
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
My original plan was to be Dr. Horrible, but that would have taken some time.

557
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
That would be fun.

558
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
All right. Jessica, before we get into some gaming news, which I know we've only been on the air about...

559
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You can be sexy Optimus Prime!

560
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Sexy fat Optimus Prime. That'll be fun. With my butt hanging out.

561
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You never know. That might turn somebody on.

562
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Oh, boy. All right. It won't be Alan. He'll be like, what are you doing? What, what, what are you doing?

563
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I thought we'd gotten past all of this, Rob.

564
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
We're only 40 minutes into the show. I haven't hit gaming news yet, but that's okay.

565
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Let's ask Jessica some more DDR fun stuff.

566
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:37,000
How did you get from being a DDR fangirl, I-can't-pass-boom-boom-dollar-the-first-time to I-am-an-administrator-on-DDR-freak?

567
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
What happened? How did you land the...

568
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I was a bitch.

569
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
No, actually, it was mostly Jamie's influence that kind of got me into the moderatorship.

570
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We were all, of course, part of DDR Freak forums, and through my friendship with Jamie,

571
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
she introduced me to a lot of the Bay Area people, and Bay Area people talked with other Bay Area people,

572
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and actually, humorously enough...

573
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So you were part of a clique?

574
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Kinda, yeah. But humorously enough, J-Dog did not want me as a moderator,

575
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and Sinon actually kind of went behind his back and just, boop, here you go.

576
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Here you go. So I was given my moderatorship because of Jamie and Inuan.

577
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The mod that was not meant to be. Oh boy, I didn't know that.

578
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah, and I was introduced to Sinon and just kind of became a mod from there,

579
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and ever since, like, there was a period of time when J-Dog and I really did not get along at all because of it,

580
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
because he always felt that I shouldn't have been a mod, and she's not ready to be a mod yet,

581
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and I know we need more people from all over, but I don't think we need another Sacramento person.

582
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Is there trials you have to go through to become a moderator?

583
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No, you just need to be able to follow the rules.

584
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Be a good babysitter.

585
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You didn't have to kiss J-Dog or anything?

586
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,000
No.

587
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

588
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
No, no kissing the co.

589
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
We did have a very epic trip to Las Vegas.

590
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yes, and we were stalked.

591
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Hold on, I want to hear how she got from moderator to administrator.

592
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Well, this is before that.

593
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Okay, okay. Alright, fine, fine.

594
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But no, we'll skip, we'll come back.

595
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,000
As for becoming administrator, it was kind of, I was helping out with a lot of the website stuff.

596
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I was available a lot more than a lot of the people, and Spike, who was the administrator at the time,

597
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
he really was having a hard time keeping up with things, and I had become an administrator because of my,

598
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
you know, my helping out type of stuff.

599
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I was, you know, doing some of the, working on some of the web stuff, keeping things handled there,

600
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
doing the DDR Freak radio, and making sure that, you know, certain people stayed banned, and what have you.

601
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And because of all that, I got my administratorship, and then Spike decided that he just couldn't dedicate enough time anymore,

602
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
and it was basically put to a little mini vote between, like, the other, you know, the other big wigs,

603
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and I kind of became head administrator.

604
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The girls at the Mean Girls head table, or whatever?

605
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah, so yeah, I became the head bitch in charge.

606
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Alright.

607
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And that's where I stayed for probably a couple years.

608
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:31,000
What was the meanest thing you ever had to do, or I guess I should say the bitchiest thing you ever had to do as an administrator?

609
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Oh, God.

610
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Well, it's, okay, here's another humorous story.

611
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
A lot of people remember Pyro Freeze.

612
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh, guh.

613
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes.

614
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And that's the reaction that most people have when mentioning Pyro Freeze.

615
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Um, yeah, he was a troll little lolol to the extreme, and we had to ban him,

616
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and he would evade the ban, and ban him again, evade the ban, ban him again, and this just went on and on and on.

617
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You know, the unfortunate part is that he's very, very smart when it comes to, you know, spoofing IPs and what have you.

618
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Really smart guy.

619
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And he finally decided he was bored with it, left over to DDREI for a while, and then just kind of dropped off the face of the planet.

620
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And then he came back, and he kind of apologized to me for being such a troll for so long.

621
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Like, I grew up, basically?

622
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah, basically I grew up, I was, you know, in my early 20s, and I was being a total jackass,

623
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and we started talking, and I started letting him stay on the forum a little bit more,

624
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and then he and I just kept getting closer and closer as friends, and we ended up going to meet up in Las Vegas.

625
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So I actually met one of our biggest trolls in Las Vegas and had a good time, we gambled.

626
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You didn't sleep with him, did you?

627
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Wait, oh my god!

628
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Just say no. If you want to say no, just say no.

629
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But he had a really big dick.

630
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Wait a minute! I can't believe it!

631
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
He's really cute!

632
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
For the record, I had no idea. I had no idea.

633
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Rob's face is a special shade of red right now.

634
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I didn't think she was going to say that, I thought she was going to say shut the fuck up.

635
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
His face or my face more.

636
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You're both, uh, I would say you're complementary shades.

637
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Wow, okay!

638
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You know what they say, Rob. Keep your friends close, and your friends...

639
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And your enemies closer?

640
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, he was very close.

641
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, but I'm thinking of like the enemies I had back in the day, and...

642
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
No. No. No. No. Not even close. No. Just ew. Ew.

643
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
No, it was one of those situations where we were kind of flirtatious ahead of time, and...

644
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
One thing led to another, and... Yeah. Stuff.

645
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Wow, okay. That was not the light of questioning, I really...

646
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Whatever, hey.

647
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, you know, when the money runs out when you're gambling, what else is there to do in Vegas?

648
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But we did come back with a cute story about how we got married.

649
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
How we were married by Elvis, and everything, but yeah.

650
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Nothing came of it, of course, it was just all in good fun, and...

651
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It was my, hey, I'm free from debt, so let me put myself into a tiny bit more to start with again.

652
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Because I had just gotten a new credit card, so...

653
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But it is interesting, all joking and laughing and lols aside, it is interesting how, you know, people really do kind of grow up and mature, and it can really change.

654
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh, he 100% did, and... That's great.

655
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah, he's an awesome guy, and I wish him well, I haven't even really talked to him for the past couple of years, but, you know, he's a cool guy.

656
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I think I remember the truce happening, because we started seeing him more and more on the forums, and we talked about it too.

657
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Well, yeah, I was trying to, I actually remember posting something in the moderator forum saying, hey guys, just back off him, you know, he's trying to be good.

658
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Interesting.

659
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Unlike other people who had been complete assholes on the forum, who got banned, and...

660
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Dan's raising his hand.

661
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yes, sweetie, I know that you're a complete asshole.

662
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Not on the forums!

663
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
He says not on the forums.

664
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Like a certain guy by the name of Jared.

665
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
By the name of Jared.

666
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And actually, I banned Tran.

667
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, yeah, Tranpawa.

668
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Good times. I love how suddenly it's talked into, like, talking about all the trolls of the DDR Freak days, and which ones of them Jessica's slept with, and which ones she has.

669
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I have Kilroy on my friends list on Facebook now, which is kind of humorous.

670
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Alright, this is funny.

671
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah, so if you are a web troll out there, just know if you turn over a new leaf, you might have some surprises in store.

672
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Thanks, Rob.

673
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You know what?

674
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Next time some damn story about Lolo or something gets brought up on Undersedation Live, it'll be well deserved.

675
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And I do have the caveat that this was at least, like, six years ago.

676
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Yeah, oh yeah.

677
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't think that would apply to the newt.

678
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Alright. Let's not go there.

679
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I didn't say it. I said it backwards.

680
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yes. Hi. Getting into gaming news.

681
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Hey, yes, let's do, let's do, we're only, like, an hour into the show. Haven't even touched on gaming news yet.

682
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Loki! Hey, no, it's okay.

683
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Trust me, it was great.

684
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Loki, put down the I, Os, and let's talk about gaming news.

685
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
You sure you don't want to talk about enemies that you've slept with or anything?

686
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I don't know if I have any.

687
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Um, definitely not, definitely not of the online DDR freaks sort.

688
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I buried mine.

689
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But I can't even, no, I mean.

690
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Have you ever had enemies? Actually, I didn't really post much on DDR freaks, so.

691
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh, everybody was my enemy. That's the other problem, so.

692
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah.

693
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And now they're all close friends. No kidding.

694
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Um, so there's a new game from Valve that was announced, Defense of the Ancients 2.

695
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And apparently it's going to be including all the 100 plus characters.

696
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Um, and I guess that's from the original game.

697
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Uh, and new social features.

698
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And, um, the game itself, of course, is kind of an action RTS.

699
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And, uh, honestly, I've never played it, nor have heard anything about it.

700
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But, I mean, I remember the same thing with Team Fortress 2.

701
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's like, Team Fortress 2? What was Team Fortress 1?

702
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Well, this is interesting, then more and more comes out about it.

703
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And, you know, if it's Valve-making, I'm sure it's going to be awesome.

704
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But, um, unfortunately I'll have to wait until, uh, 2011 to actually be able to play the game.

705
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
But, um, I'm sure if they're making a sequel to it, it was probably insanely popular to begin with.

706
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Well, yeah, Defense of the Ancients was a huge Warcraft 3 thing.

707
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah.

708
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah, so that's, uh, that's pretty cool.

709
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah.

710
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And, uh, it's going to be sort of, because, you know, since Warcraft has kind of gone the way of World of Warcraft, which is not an RTS,

711
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
you basically have Starcraft and you have, you know, your handful of other RTSs on the PC.

712
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Uh, it'll be really, this, this is going to be, you know, especially the fact that, A, it's coming from Valve.

713
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's a, it's a mod that tons and tons and tons of Warcraft players are very familiar with.

714
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's going to be very interesting to see how that kind of translates into a spin-off game.

715
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I, I bet it'll be really good.

716
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And very successful the way Team Fortress 2 was.

717
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Absolutely. Especially if they bundle it in an Uber pack of games like they did, you know, with Team Fortress 2.

718
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Well, I don't even think that's necessary, but just the support that they put towards their games, I mean,

719
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
like it even Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2 or Team Fortress.

720
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I mean, it's just so much damn support after the fact that, you know, they really keep up interest in the game long after it's come out.

721
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You know, maybe there will be like a sequel to the Orange Box that could be this and, uh, I don't know,

722
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
like maybe Half-Life Episode 3, just saying.

723
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Sequel to the Orange Box, the blue ball.

724
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Alright. Uh, wah wah wah. Alright, uh, speaking of wah wah and sad things,

725
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
the developers behind Xbox 360's game rooms is shutting their doors.

726
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
That's right. Chrome Studios, they're located in Australia. They are shutting down.

727
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's a done deal, unfortunately.

728
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Sadly, this was sort of something you kind of saw coming because they've been scaling back for a while.

729
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
They closed some of their studios throughout Australia earlier in the year.

730
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
The remaining staff at the studios in Brisbane and Melbourne have been let go.

731
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Both studios are closing their doors tomorrow morning, which would be today in Australia.

732
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
They're like, scale back, way back. No, really, all the way back. You're gone.

733
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's the future in Australia.

734
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
The sad thing is that they were Australia's largest development house and so now they are gone.

735
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Of course there are some lingering questions as to what's going to happen to Game Room

736
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
because they were kind of the biggest things behind Game Room.

737
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I promise you, just as many releases on Game Room now as there...

738
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah, they'll keep scaling it back to like one game a week.

739
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, I mean, it should be said there are still games being released for Game Room.

740
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,000
There are?

741
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh, yeah. They've been pretty good about doing them every week.

742
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm not going to say they're always good games or well known, but actually I believe I was looking at what was coming up next week.

743
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Let me look real quick here. There's actually a list available on Wikipedia.

744
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So I don't know if I would say doom and gloom in the end of Game Room just yet because they still have.

745
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
For October 13th, Game Pack 10 gets more releases that include Radar Lock...

746
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh, no. That was this week. I'm sorry.

747
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
What was on deck for next week?

748
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Oh, here we go.

749
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Breakout on the Atari, Double Dunk on the Atari, and Jackal, the arcade game from Konami, which was a classic game of the week before.

750
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So, I mean, they still have some...

751
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Even though two of those releases are kind of...

752
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Okay, whatever. You do still have a pretty good memorable title in there.

753
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And that's going to be Game Pack 11 because I think that's the start of a new Game Pack.

754
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So I don't think you can say that Game Room's really dead.

755
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Seeing as the Microsoft logo's on that, it would make sense to me that the assets will get transformed over to Microsoft.

756
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That might ultimately be a good thing because maybe Microsoft will give it to someone else and say,

757
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Here, make this better. Or they will say, We will now write this off. So I don't know what's going to happen.

758
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's sort of on life support right now.

759
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It is, but it'll be interesting to see if the sales are good, where there's money to be made.

760
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
One of Game Room's biggest flaws, besides all the things I've talked about this game way too much on the show,

761
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
but despite the flaws it has of no online multiplayer at the same time and all that,

762
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
one of its other biggest drawbacks is no publishers besides Atari and television and Konami seem to be on board.

763
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
If they could at least get a couple more publishers or some rights to some other games,

764
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
even if it's Commodore 64, computer games, they could really breathe some life back into this thing,

765
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
but it'll just depend on do they want to, are the sales there,

766
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
but even if they're only selling 50 copies of Jackal, which I bet they're selling more than that,

767
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's a fucking ROM. It doesn't take that much.

768
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It's free money.

769
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
They build the emulator and that's it.

770
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Well, they have to, to be fair, they have to do art for the cabinet, they have to QA to make sure it doesn't glitch.

771
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
There is some work.

772
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Art for the cabinet? That stuff's already out there.

773
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But they have to make it into the Xbox art, you know what I mean?

774
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
They have to turn what was out there into an actual in-game thing.

775
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm not saying it's a lot of work, Loki. It doesn't take like a 20-man team to do,

776
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
but there is some work involved in it.

777
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Fine.

778
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So it's not completely free. Anyhow.

779
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And some spazzinator, PSN in our chatroom at chat.order-sons-ready.com says,

780
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Game Room is one of my favorite games on my 360 and Defective Candy says,

781
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Baw, I loved Game Room.

782
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There's a lot I do still like about Game Room, you know, and I'm kind of sad to see that it might be done.

783
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But I don't, you know, Black Wolf in chat says,

784
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Even the games, quote, nobody plays has at least 400 people on the leaderboard.

785
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So, you know, 400 times 3, $1200. That's still something.

786
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
He said he was playing in television pinball, and that was one of the...

787
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Wow. Alright, anyhow.

788
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And I agree with Rama, we need Mercs.

789
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Let's move on to some more gaming news, Dark Sakura, and we'll see.

790
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't think, I would not put the nail in the coffin of Game Room just yet.

791
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It might be on life support, as Jamie said, but it's not flatlined yet.

792
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Well, speaking in terms of games that have previously been on their last legs that may or may not have a forever title attached to it coming out one day.

793
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'm still not holding my breath for the record.

794
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It'll be this spring.

795
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm not holding my breath.

796
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:14,000
At any rate, there is a non-commercial license out to go ahead and make the fan-made Duke Nukem Next Gen.

797
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That is basically a remake of Duke Nukem 3D using the Unreal Engine.

798
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And I watched some of the film of it, and it looks sweet.

799
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Duke Nukem 3D, I have to say, was probably my...

800
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You know what? I think I played this before I played Doom.

801
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Really?

802
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And it was also my first LAN game that I ever played.

803
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Where you get to do the little voice macros in it. It was really great.

804
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Anyway, he was also working on Next Gen remakes of Daikatana and Sin, but this one was given the green light, so he was going to make a multiplayer demo of it that should be out fairly soon.

805
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And the full version will be out, he says, when it's done.

806
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And it's just a code frame.

807
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Check this out.

808
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Go ahead. That's actually really cool for the developers to do.

809
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm very surprised that they're not trying to do it themselves.

810
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, I'm very surprised that they aren't going to put this on a console, because seriously, an HD remake of Duke Nukem 3D would be fucking awesome.

811
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Well, it would be a little redundant, because there's already Duke Nukem 3D.

812
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Who cares, though? I mean, a little redundant. I mean, all these HD versions of games, and that's just making the sprites look prettier. This is actually rebuilding the game.

813
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It looks gorgeous.

814
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, yeah, they definitely kind of rebuilt that first level in there, and I know this doesn't translate well to radio, but you're kind of seeing a...

815
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'm going to link the video in the chatroom.

816
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You're kind of seeing a remake of that first level, where you're on the rooftops and things kind of crash down. You sort of see a remake of that here in this engine.

817
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's pretty cool.

818
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It moves very smoothly.

819
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'd be very cool if you can kind of get the multiplayer and everything working in this.

820
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That would be fantastic.

821
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Again, I'm just surprised the developers sort of said, yeah, we're not going to do it. Go ahead.

822
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You know? And kind of was a step above the whole King's Quest Silver Lining debacle, where that game got shut down, and then it didn't get shut down, and all that stuff. That was very cool.

823
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I think this is... I would play this. And normally, first person games like that, especially ones that are actually 3D models, make me really motion sick. I would still play this.

824
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
This would probably be my new Portal.

825
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It would be fun, especially with the multiplayer and everything. But I don't know. Some things I think we tend to see through the retro-colored glasses, a little play on the rose-colored glasses, retro-colored glasses, because I know when I played Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live, I was like, oh, this is cool.

826
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And then I was like, oh, but I don't know. It's just not the same as it was when I was 18 in the college dorms.

827
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Kind of like playing Atari now versus playing Atari when you were first...

828
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
There's some games that never lose their charm in Atari.

829
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You make a good point, but I don't play it... I don't play it as much as I used to when I was a kid, but it's still kind of cool to have.

830
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Because, yeah, sometimes I'll get bored, and I'll just kind of go into game room, and I'm like, oh, let me just play Keystone Capers for a minute. And then I'm done.

831
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I don't stay up all night playing it like I used to when I was six, and we would have people in little sleepovers and whatever, but it's still kind of cool to have.

832
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Anyhow. Alright, moving on to some more gaming news, release dates, Classic Game of the Week coming up in a little while as well, but first, Loki.

833
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yes, Red Dead Redemption, of course, is getting its new expansion pack. Coming out October 26th, the Undead Nightmare brings zombies into the wonderful game of Red Dead Redemption.

834
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And that's all sorts of awesome by itself, but if you happen to, say, want to skip buying Red Dead Redemption, just want to get straight to the zombies, screw all this single player storyline,

835
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
you can actually purchase a standalone disc that bundles together all of the download content.

836
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Undead Nightmare pack, that's coming with Outlaws to the End co-op mission pack, Legends and Killers pack, Liars and Cheats pack, and the multiplayer free roam mode.

837
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:33,000
That's going to be in stores, I guess, it's a couple weeks actually, for 30 bucks, and I believe that's only on Xbox 360, but it may very well be coming to both platforms, but as of right now I know it's coming to Xbox 360, but that's cool.

838
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Because zombies have to be in everything, right?

839
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Hell yeah. You have a zombie horse, you can fight zombie bears.

840
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
With your zombie guns?

841
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
The guns are not living.

842
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
How well does the whole DLC in stores thing do? I don't know if you have any insight to that from your distribution perspective, but does that actually do well?

843
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
This is different though, and yes, they do sell, but this is separate, you do not need the original game to play this.

844
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh, I missed that, sorry.

845
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's just the online component only to the game. Well, you can technically play the free roam offline, but there's no storyline. It's just, here's the world, go play. That's it.

846
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
That's kind of neat. A nice alternative, I guess, for those that maybe don't even want to play the single player.

847
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, you really should play the single player, because it's really awesome, but yeah, that's cool, and I haven't really been buying any of the download content for Red Dead Redemption, but I may have to check this out, because I do like me some zombies.

848
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Alright, well something else we like here at Orange On Radio, of course, is the old school music games, and one of those music games, you know, we've been talking a lot about DDR tonight, but of course there was another game that was very near and dear to a lot of our hearts, and that was Beatmania 2DX.

849
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And Beatmania 2DX, you may or may not know, it's still going in Japan, and even as machines trickle over here to the US, it's going on here too.

850
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But in the homes, they've stopped somewhat in Japan, and it's been a while. It's been a year since Beatmania 2DX 16, what was it, Princess was 16th? I don't even remember.

851
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Princess.

852
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Yes, Beatmania 2DX 16 was like a year ago that that came out, and they did say it would be the last PlayStation 2 release. Well being that it's been a year, and no sign of Beatmania 2DX 17, which came out in arcades some time ago, and now what, they've already announced 18 as well, so they're getting ahead.

853
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Some Japanese fans actually took it up to create a petition saying, hey, we want Beatmania 2DX 17, Sirius, to come out for the consoles, either be PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 or what have you.

854
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But see that's the problem though, is they have, before it was just, you know, take the same engine, add new songs. Done. Reskin it, done.

855
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And the chat room was yelling at me, it was Empress, not Princess.

856
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Thank God, because Princess is really gay sounding. No, I was gonna say-

857
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And what's wrong with that?

858
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
No, there should be Diva Edition.

859
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
What's wrong with that is I don't think you'd have as many players playing Princess.

860
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Beatmania 2DX 19 style, super pretty happy fun edition.

861
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I'd play that.

862
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Super gay unicorn edition.

863
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Always have fun at Beatmania.

864
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Exactly.

865
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'd have to play that actually.

866
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's easy.

867
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But only that shader.

868
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
That has nothing to do with the game.

869
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,000
See that's what I think the problem is right now, they don't have a brand new piece of software to work off if they don't have anything made before.

870
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So they're trying to create something new in order for it to support Beatmania.

871
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And really they could just upskill the stuff that they have, but whatever.

872
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Well regardless, some Japanese fans decided to get together and start this online petition which started circulating its way on some of the big American sites like Bimani style and some of those as well.

873
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Is, hey, you need to release this game over here.

874
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
What's interesting though, you might go, oh yeah, online petitions, yeah, you're gonna have a lot of luck with those because those always do the trick.

875
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Unless it's Betty White and Saturday Night Live, it's not gonna happen. Right?

876
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I was part of that one.

877
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Me too.

878
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But, here's the thing, is that you might remember Beatmania 2DX 7th style many years ago.

879
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
There was a huge break between 6th style and 7th style.

880
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,000
7th style never came out until Konami was like, okay well if X, Y number of people pre-order the game then we'll make it in a limited, I don't know.

881
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
But they finally ended up releasing it and it was a big deal.

882
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I mean it kept the series going from 7 through 16 on the Playstation 2 which is a very long time.

883
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And Konami actually responded to this.

884
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Konami has written a little response.

885
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They actually used the little Twitter tag thing, CS serious or whatever.

886
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:00,000
They put, were another 2DX CS game to be released, would you like it to be on PS2, PS3, or another system?

887
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:09,000
This might tie in a little bit too and I think something that's not really touched on in this particular article I'm looking at but I remember on Naoki Madea's Facebook,

888
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
he actually was asking, and he does a lot of the stuff in music games, he asked a very similar question.

889
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
He did like a little survey, like what systems do you play games on, do you want to see games on PS3, what games do you want to see?

890
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So Konami is kind of exploring this a little bit and I think, I hope anyway, a lot of people responded to this saying PS3, PS3, do it, do it, do it.

891
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It was a great thing, hopefully it would be region free because PS3 is region free.

892
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It would be region free. You wouldn't even have to worry about having to get a Japanese PlayStation 3.

893
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I've got pilot controllers in the vault.

894
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Good times.

895
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Just collecting dust.

896
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Region locked either though, so.

897
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Orange Right in our chat room says, is CS serious endorsed by President Cat?

898
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Oh, President Cat.

899
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I think so, but remember CS serious is coming from Japan and President Cat would be a US thing even though he could be like the world's president, so I think there would need to be like Ambassador Puppy or something.

900
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And President Cat's a girl.

901
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Alright.

902
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Maybe that's why we didn't get President Cat over here.

903
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And Black Wolf, our pal, is correcting us saying it was 15,000 pre-orders because he was one of them.

904
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I knew a couple people that were in on that too.

905
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So it will be interesting to see if Konami continues with this. I think they will. My gut tells me they'll do it and it will be PS3.

906
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
We'll see.

907
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And I'll probably buy it.

908
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I think it will be multi-platform because they're not going to put all their eggs in PS3.

909
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Well if it's Japan only then yeah it would be PS3, but if it does come out over here it will be multi-platform because PS3 sales over here aren't.

910
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I don't think they'll bother with it over here.

911
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Honestly I think what they're going to do is do it on PS3 for wide release in Japan and do a limited release on PS3 in the United States.

912
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That would make sense.

913
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
That's what I see happening.

914
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
How many copies did they make of Beatmania when they brought it out over here?

915
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And does Beatmania's 2DX still use licensed music? It's more about like the controllers would be the biggest pain in the butt.

916
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Well they've got controllers. If they used the redone model for the controllers they really were a lot better.

917
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah but now it's all USB on the PS3. You have to have a converter which either way you're looking at some type of peripheral.

918
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm sure they could rework the controller.

919
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
They make them.

920
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
There's also those multi-converter things so you can use other controllers on different systems.

921
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
If they haven't been locked out by Sony.

922
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Or just use your guitar. Just play 2DX on your guitar. Freaks.

923
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Not guitar freaks. Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero. Whatever.

924
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I was really hoping to have DJ Hero 2 this week. I got cock blocked at work unfortunately.

925
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm sorry to hear it.

926
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Life sucks sometimes.

927
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It's like if I can't get it that early I don't want it.

928
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Well how about something else though about Guitar Hero since we brought it up.

929
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It sucks. Actually it's dying.

930
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's actually dying.

931
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Uh oh. Dying. Um.

932
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock sold 86,000 copies its first week in the US on all formats.

933
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Yeah here's the numbers for the other ones.

934
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 units.

935
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Is that overall or in its first week?

936
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
In its first week.

937
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
These are first months that I'm going through now.

938
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
This was just the first week. The 86,000.

939
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
The rest of these are going to be.

940
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 in its first month in 2009.

941
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Guitar Hero World Tour sold 50,000 in its first week in 2008.

942
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And Guitar Hero 3 sold 1.4 million units in 5 days.

943
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Now these are also going back in time.

944
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
We're talking 499,000 units in a month for Guitar Hero 5 in 2009.

945
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And then in 2008 and before that in 2007.

946
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
But they're talking about in its first month?

947
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,000
No.

948
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Its first week.

949
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Guitar Hero 5 was in its first month.

950
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It sold just under as many units as Guitar Hero World Tour did in a week.

951
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Oh. Wow. Okay.

952
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And most of these games tend to sell in the first few weeks.

953
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Although, couldn't you argue that Guitar Hero is going to have some lasting power through the holidays?

954
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Because it's a game that Grandma might buy the kids?

955
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't know so much.

956
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I mean, really, if it was going to draw in the business, the numbers would have stayed steady, I think.

957
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
No one cared about Guitar Hero this year.

958
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And the reason why is because they...

959
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Rock Band 3?

960
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
No, not really, because a lot of people don't care about Rock Band 3 either.

961
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They kind of have the mentality, oh, music games, that genre is dead.

962
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
They're dumb.

963
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Well, actually going to say that, Harmonix actually had to convince people that the whole genre wasn't declining.

964
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Basically the CEO was saying, and I quote,

965
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I absolutely do not believe that rhythm action gaming has reached its peak.

966
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But, eh, they're saying in the UK that Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock launched at a 6 on the list and rated a 7 out of 10.

967
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Well, here's the thing is, I think Guitar Hero is just getting stale to a lot of people.

968
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I mean, what did this new game bring to the table?

969
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
They brought transforming characters.

970
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
We get a keytar in Rock Band.

971
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Here's why Guitar Hero 5 sold more than Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

972
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Guitar Hero 5, for the first month, included Guitar Hero Van Halen for free.

973
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The new Guitar Hero included a Soundgarden album.

974
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Who gives a crap about the Soundgarden album?

975
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I would have gotten the Soundgarden album.

976
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Okay, let me put it this way.

977
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I'm a Van Hagar fan, so I would have picked Soundgarden over...

978
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But it was a game that people would be able to get their hands on months before it was released.

979
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
A $12 CD versus a $40 game, I get it.

980
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
But keep in mind...

981
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
They charge full price.

982
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Assholes.

983
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Just as many copies sold in a week a year before, and it didn't have a pack in a bonus game.

984
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Might I remind everybody, once again, and I can't say Activision is the only culprit for this, but...

985
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Wii games, or Wii versions of Guitar Hero, and Wii versions of Rock Band, and Wii versions of DJ Hero,

986
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
and the Wii versions of the Tony Hawk Shred game that's coming out, all $60 retail.

987
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Wow.

988
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Despite the fact that most Wii games top out at $50.

989
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Their excuse, oh, we need more money for music licensing.

990
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Wait, wait, wait, why is Tony Hawk more expensive then?

991
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Cuz, you know...

992
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Cuz we wanna pay the Deftones more money.

993
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Cuz no one's gonna buy it anyway, so, you know, whatever.

994
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,000
$1,000,000.

995
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Bobby makes a good point in our chat room.

996
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
BlackWolf in chat.orangetownshreddy.com, live here on this Sunday night, says,

997
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah, hey, music games are an oversaturated genre.

998
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
There are a total of four music games that came out this year.

999
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And how many first person shooters?

1000
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I know, right?

1001
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Or sports games? Or...

1002
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You know, just saying.

1003
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I think what's gonna come down...

1004
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
We'll have to see how Rock Band 3 does, because it's not...

1005
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I mean, you can't really go off of Green Day Rock Band.

1006
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Cuz I knew that was gonna be terrible when it first came out.

1007
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Or when it was first announced.

1008
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And the Beatles Rock Band, eh...

1009
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Was awesome?

1010
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
But both are niche. Both are niche.

1011
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
They are niche.

1012
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Even though the Beatles is like, a big niche, and Green Day is a smaller niche,

1013
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
They're both a little too...

1014
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
They're niche, and that limits the audience.

1015
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think Rock Band 3 is gonna be pretty incredible.

1016
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But I don't think it's gonna be as big of a jump as Rock Band 1 to Rock Band 2.

1017
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Because a lot of people are like,

1018
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Well, why do I need the upgrade? Cuz I have all these thousands of songs already.

1019
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
You know, with download content, do I really need 80 songs?

1020
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I think Rock Band 3 will have the lasting power through Christmas, though.

1021
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I think Rock Band 3 will be one of those.

1022
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
It's not gonna impress when it first comes out, but it's just gonna...

1023
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It'll be very steady.

1024
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's got the harmony in it, doesn't it?

1025
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Yeah.

1026
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So that makes me happy. I'm getting it.

1027
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's gonna be the game that people see at parties and want to get at their own house.

1028
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I'm getting a fucking keyboard.

1029
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
That's one of the key mistakes that this new Guitar Hero...

1030
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And this is the point I wanted to get to in the beginning.

1031
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Guitar Hero, the new things it brought to the table were almost all single-player things.

1032
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But Rock Band 3 is bringing more things to the multiplayer experience.

1033
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,000
A fast story mode, a new keyboard, these new ways of dropping in and out really quick.

1034
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Everything it's bringing to the table is for the party.

1035
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And a new promo-type thing, which, I mean, some people might be interested in that.

1036
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And with, like, at least the drums and the keyboards, that might kind of teach you how to play that stuff.

1037
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I guess even the guitar, if you want to spend the money on the guitar.

1038
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Well, Rob, you remember my birthday?

1039
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
We did nothing but play Rock Band the entire time.

1040
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And it was fun, and people who were just arriving could just come in and play.

1041
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And we were cycling people out. It's an easy party game.

1042
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Tiger C'mon, our chat room, has a good point.

1043
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Rock Band 3 is going to raise the bar because of its peripherals can be used as real instruments.

1044
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Guitar Hero will soon follow with their own version.

1045
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That's a darn good point. We didn't even address that.

1046
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
One thing that Rock Band has that Guitar Hero is not going to have is this whole learn to actually play, or the pro mode.

1047
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Granted, it's, you know, a little bit controversial, and who knows how many people will actually get to really learn to play from it.

1048
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
But I know me, personally, as someone who played the piano and the keyboard and all that stuff growing up,

1049
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I am really excited about the pro keyboard mode that's going to be in this game,

1050
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
and the fact that you are actually learning keyboard parts for these songs. That's awesome.

1051
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Or, someone like Bobby could probably appreciate this.

1052
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:08,000
They also have the MIDI controller that you can buy for your MIDI-enabled instruments, and just drop that in straight to the game.

1053
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Doesn't he have a full MIDI drum set?

1054
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I believe he does. And probably a keyboard.

1055
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
He's a huge drummer guy. He makes money off some of that stuff, so I imagine he does. He'll say in chat in a minute, I'm sure.

1056
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
He writes his own theme song. He's gotta have some fun toys there.

1057
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Anyhow, let's travel around the world.

1058
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
We could use a new theme song too, Bobby.

1059
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Let's travel around the world and take a look at some release dates and things coming to a store near you.

1060
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:47,000
This week is quite exciting. Like I mentioned before, I was trying to get it, but I gotta wait until it comes out like everybody else.

1061
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Whatever.

1062
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So DJ Hero 2 is coming out this week. That's going to be on all three major systems.

1063
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I guess I'll have to wait until the 3DS version comes out for the portable DJ Hero.

1064
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So that's kinda cool.

1065
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And then of course they're going to be re-releasing the first DJ Hero game in case you want to buy the standalone thing.

1066
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And then they have the bundles with the controllers. The bundles with two controllers and a microphone because you need two turntables and a microphone.

1067
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So that's all fun stuff.

1068
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Other slightly more boring stuff.

1069
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Solitaire Overload Plus I had delayed from last week. Still hasn't come out. Still don't care.

1070
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Kirby's Epic Yarn that came out today, so that's pretty exciting.

1071
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Farmtopia on the DS. It's a farm sim. Awesome.

1072
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
G.

1073
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:49,000
My First Dollhouse. Not picking that one up, but that's on the DS as well.

1074
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I Love Puppies. That's also on DS.

1075
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Other fun things coming out.

1076
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Zuzu Pets. Kung Zu also held over from I think last week. That's on DS.

1077
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And also those new Tron controllers that glow. Those are coming out this week.

1078
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Need one to have to have.

1079
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I totally want that keyboard and mouse set.

1080
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Can I just say a tangent because I want to do that whole like, I got something special. I got tickets to that Tron Knight thing.

1081
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And I just realized yesterday, same day as my friend's birthday, that if I don't go to whatever birthday shenanigans she plans, I will be murdered.

1082
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So yeah. I don't know if I'm going to be able to go now. Sad panda.

1083
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And no, taking her to Tron Knight is not an option because that's not something she'd want to do.

1084
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Sorry Loki.

1085
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Another holdover from last week. Lead Shred featuring the Jamaican bobsled team on the Wii.

1086
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
What?

1087
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Wait, wait, wait. I remember you mentioning that last week and I made fun of it.

1088
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
That's why I said it was a holdover from last week.

1089
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Oh, sorry.

1090
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
As was the Wii inflatable racing cart.

1091
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah, Rob, pay attention.

1092
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Sorry, I was reading our chat room and looking at Bobby's pictures.

1093
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I want the inflatable racing cart. We should put Shermy in it.

1094
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And the best part about that Wii inflatable racing cart, much like the inflatable raft, I'm sure that could be used in the pool as well.

1095
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Naruto, ship it in. Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1096
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
EA Sports MMA on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.

1097
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
A little known game called Fallout New Vegas coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1098
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Oh, I've heard of that game.

1099
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Yes, I hear it's popular.

1100
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yes, I hear Fallout is a little cult franchise. I hear it's a very artsy game.

1101
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Arcanium Gothic 4 on Xbox 360 out this week.

1102
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Imagine Resort Owner. Imagine I Don't Care. That's on DS.

1103
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Enhance for the DSi, by the way.

1104
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Active Life Explorer. That's Namco's fitness kids game. That's on the Wii.

1105
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Kevin Van Dam Fishing on PlayStation 3. Not as exciting as Jean-Claude Van Dam Fishing.

1106
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And that joke was fail.

1107
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Blazing Souls Accolade on PSP this week.

1108
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Sesame Street. Elmo's Eat-A-Zoo Adventure.

1109
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Did you say Sesame Street?

1110
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
No, I said Sesame Street.

1111
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I want to go to Sesame Street. Listen, bird!

1112
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
You know, I had these DVDs I brought home for Nelly. It was Sesame Shalom.

1113
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I want to see that.

1114
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Jewish Sesame Street.

1115
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Yeah, I've seen pictures of them. I've went in to see those.

1116
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yeah. She's like, this is stupid. I'm like, okay.

1117
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,000
CSI Fatal Conspiracy on Wii. I believe that's PlayStation 3 and 360.

1118
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Saw II Flesh and Blood on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.

1119
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Oh god, that's right. I forgot they were making a sequel to the Saw game.

1120
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Bakugan Defenders of the Core on the Wii.

1121
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, and DS and PSP I believe.

1122
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 11 on...

1123
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Lots of stuff this week.

1124
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
DS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and then of course they're going to have bundles for all that stuff.

1125
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
They're actually making a wireless shotgun for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 which is kind of neat, I suppose.

1126
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
What other fun stuff? Brunswick Cosmic Bowling with a bowling ball.

1127
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That's right. I mentioned that last week and that's still a bad idea.

1128
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Rock of the Dead on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

1129
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Might be just the 360 version because I thought PlayStation 3 got delayed.

1130
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Seems to be a big week. Is the holiday season like, are we here now?

1131
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Oh yeah, we're here.

1132
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Oh wow, it seems like we're here early this year.

1133
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I guess it is October, it's like mid-October. Where have I been?

1134
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
This is like the third week of October.

1135
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Dirt Rock, yes I have.

1136
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
The Shoot on PlayStation 3, it's the backlot themed shooter game.

1137
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Smart Girls Playhouse Party, that's a game for little kids.

1138
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
That's on the PS.

1139
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,000

1140

01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000

1142
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Flip's Twisted World on the Wii.

1143
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Holy crap that's expensive.

1144
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
For the PlayStation 3 to get geared up for Gran Turismo 5.

1145
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Apparently Thrustmaster has a really expensive steering wheel that you can get for $250.

1146
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Called the Ferrari Wireless GT Cockpit 430.

1147
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Thrustmaster.

1148
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Scuderia edition.

1149
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Thrust it, thrust it!

1150
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Thank you, that's what I was getting at.

1151
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Were you listening last night? Cause I brought that exact same thing up.

1152
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I was like oh my god the bopagon, there's only so many times you can say pull it and whack it.

1153
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Before somebody's going to wonder why this is a G show.

1154
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:39,000
No I admit I was at the wedding reception and I probably wouldn't have even gotten signal to run the all games app on my phone to listen.

1155
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I had a good conversation about that last night on the show.

1156
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Well if you ever update your podcast feed, DG Morpheus, just saying.

1157
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Vanquish, the new game from Platinum Games is out this week.

1158
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
That's right, this is the one that came from the creator of the Resident Evil series.

1159
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
That's on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.

1160
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi tag team on PSP.

1161
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Holy crap there's a lot of stuff.

1162
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Time Crisis Raising Storm on PlayStation 3.

1163
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
This is the second game you can use your Gun Con 3.

1164
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Woo hoo! Gun Con 3.

1165
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
What other fun stuff do we have coming out this week?

1166
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Eve Online commissioned Officer Edition for PC.

1167
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Cars Toon Mater's Tall Tales on the Wii.

01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Cars Toon Mater's Tall Tales on the Wii.

1169
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:43,000
She's laughing because I got told to shut my whore mouth by a lovely host of another radio show in our chat room.

1170
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Who's not Bobby?

1171
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Hidden Mysteries Salem Witch Trials on the Nintendo DS.

1172
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Lots of junk.

1173
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Is that your professional assessment as a video game analyst?

1174
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Crap crap and more crap.

1175
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Super analyst, okay.

1176
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Is Toon making me think of Madeline Kahn?

1177
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
No no no no no yes.

1178
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Can I go to Japanese releases?

1179
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
No you can't, we're not done yet.

1180
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Bring a book to the show.

1181
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm going to girlcat your list, Loki, so we can move on to Rob.

1182
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
No, we're almost done.

1183
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Hurry up.

1184
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Shaun White's Skateboarding.

1185
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
That's the last thing coming out, it's a week from today.

1186
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And that is on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

1187
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I am done.

1188
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I love Bobby. Bobby's so great.

1189
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Do you now?

1190
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Thank you for that clarification.

1191
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I was like, wait, did I say that?

1192
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates.

1193
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Xbox 360 in Japan!

1194
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We have FIFA Soccer 11, Medal of Honor, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2,

1195
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
R.U.S.E. or Roos, and Vanquish all come out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

1196
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
That's on the 21st.

1197
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
R.U.S.

1198
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Rats of Unusual Size.

1199
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
On the Playstation 3 we have Big 3 Gun Shooting,

1200
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
which I'm sure is the same as one of those games that Loki just named with the gun gone.

1201
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Beat Sketch comes out this week.

1202
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
As well as FIFA Soccer 11, Kung Fu Rider,

1203
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Me and My Pet, which I think is the what?

1204
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Connectimal?

1205
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
That's an eye pet.

1206
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Not on the SOTY system.

1207
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Medal of Honor, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2,

1208
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and the Playstation Eye and the Move and the Resident Evil 5 pack are all this week in Japan.

1209
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
It'd be better if it was Me and My Penthouse Pet.

1210
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
R.U.S.E., Sports Champion, and Vanquish all also on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan.

1211
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
So I guess we're getting into a very busy week in Japan as well.

1212
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Just so you know, is this game in the U.S. Beat Sketch?

1213
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I don't know this one.

1214
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
No, I thought that was coming out only on the Playstation Network here.

1215
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Interesting, because they are releasing it as a title on the Playstation 3.

1216
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It is a move game where it looks like you kind of draw and little patterns sort of come out.

1217
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
You sketch the different Playstation shapes or whatever,

1218
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
and I'm assuming it kind of makes music.

1219
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And you can see this lovely little girl here drawing flowers,

1220
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and I'm assuming it's music because you see a little counter in the corner.

1221
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So it looks like it might be kind of neat.

1222
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
That looks kind of fun. Could you imagine though playing like Oendan with something like that?

1223
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
If they ever brought Oendan out on the Wii.

1224
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Is there a music game you'd like to see on Playstation Move?

1225
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I want Space Channel 5, I'm not even going to lie.

1226
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
That would be fantastic.

1227
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I was trying to think whether...

1228
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It has to have a special controller that looks like Ulala's mic.

1229
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Here's a preview here real quick in the studio for this beat sketch,

1230
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
and I'll post this YouTube to our chat room as well.

1231
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
It looks like Mario Paint but happier or something, I don't know.

1232
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I don't know.

1233
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I see that people are drawing on the screen.

1234
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Some really intricate artwork though.

1235
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Interesting. It's cute.

1236
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yeah, it looks like it could be neat.

1237
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
It's a clever little commercial, it doesn't really say much about the game.

1238
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
If you want to see that YouTube we were just playing, FamitsuTube is the link there.

1239
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'm assuming that must be part of Famitsu Magazine. There you go.

1240
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I was going to say there is the new Dance Dance Revolution game that will be coming out

1241
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
that actually utilizes the Playstation Move to do all sorts of weird Para type stuff.

1242
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
This week here in the US or is that soon?

1243
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
No, it's next month. About a month from now.

1244
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You know what, I could just hook up the Pink Biscuits.

1245
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Going to the Japanese release dates on the Nintendo Wii.

1246
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Minna de Buchen Family Trainer comes out this week in Japan.

1247
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I don't know what this game is. It's a sports game of some sort but it looks like cute little Indiana Jonesy family characters.

1248
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
In fact, even on the cover they have a family dressed up as Indiana Jones.

1249
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It looks like a newer version of the power pad that two people use at once is what it looks like.

1250
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Imagine you have an up, down, and no arrow facing towards the other player but one facing away.

1251
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It's like three arrows in the center.

1252
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Yes, that's the active life game that came out over here.

1253
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Oh, okay. So it is. Interesting.

1254
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Well, it's definitely regionalized for Japan now. It's coming out over there.

1255
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yes, because it doesn't have kids on the front. It has cutesy anime stuff on the front.

1256
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Yes. No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle comes out this week in Japan.

1257
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And the Super Mario Collection Special Pack which we've talked about earlier on the show.

1258
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
The whole, if you want to pay a lot of money for an old Super Nintendo ROM.

1259
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Super Mario All Stars game that they could have brought to the Virtual Console because they don't release anything on Virtual Console anymore.

1260
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Are you done?

1261
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:56,000
On the Nintendo DS, Strike Witches 2 Yasunaso Puni Puni Suru comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.

1262
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
What game is that? I don't know.

1263
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It's a shooter.

1264
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's a shooter too. Dang, these characters are huge. It looks like Contra with chicks wearing bunny ears in school uniforms with skirts that are way too short.

1265
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And there's kind of a sensual massage between two chicks going on right there.

1266
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
There's no such thing as skirts that are way too short.

1267
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Just saying.

1268
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Lastly on the PS...

1269
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Can I do mine? Can I do mine? Can I do mine?

1270
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Just pee real quick, I promise. FIFA Soccer 11 Beyblade Portable Slaughter Mania P. Okay, now you can do yours.

1271
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Okay. Mine are very, very British.

1272
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Okay, not really.

1273
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Releases for the UK. We have today. Well, it's already today. It's the future there. I forgot.

1274
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,000
The 17th, The Political Machine on PC. On the 20th is Costume Quest Super Meat Boy.

1275
01:30:51,000 --> 01:31:01,000
On the 21st we have Professor Layton and the Unwound Future. On the 22nd, EA Sports MMA and Fallout New Vegas, which is gonna be hot.

1276
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
We also have Monopoly Streets and NBA Jam and Vanquish and Vanquish.

1277
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And no more Vanquish.

1278
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
And no more mic cord.

1279
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Did it cut out again?

1280
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Yeah, we have dead air right now.

1281
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You alright?

1282
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Do we have dead air now?

1283
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:21,000
No, you're good.

1284
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Okay, do you want me to read my list again?

1285
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
No, no, we just didn't get the Vanquish, Vanquish and More Vanquish part that you said.

1286
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Okay, on the 22nd is Vanquish. And also on the 22nd, Vanquish. And no more Vanquish.

1287
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Promise me we'll get a mic cord before next week.

1288
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Death Spank's coming out the week after. And that just has the best name ever, Death Spank.

1289
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Bobby in our chat room again has a really good comment. Beat Sketches is close to Owen Don as she'll actually be able to get, he says.

1290
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Sad face. Owen Don is awesome.

1291
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I don't know about that. Because I think that the new Dance Dance Revolution game has some fruity little mode in it that's, you know, with the stupid move controllers.

1292
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I'm sorry, I can't take Konami seriously anymore with their dancing games. I mean, just with Dance Master, you're gonna really look at, you can learn how to dance with this game.

1293
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
No, you're gonna look like a fool if you try to do what they do in that game in real life.

1294
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
But Para Para was awesome because you looked like a fool, am I right?

1295
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Don't get me wrong, okay?

1296
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Jessica, didn't you love the Para Para?

1297
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Not totally. There was a couple that I knew how to do that I liked, but other than that, I'm like, I'm gonna goth dance this shit!

1298
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I loved it when you goth danced on the Para Para machine because it was like this walking irony.

1299
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm gonna goth dance to super happy music!

1300
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Don't get me wrong, I mean, I probably have the game pre-ordered just to check it out, but, I mean, come on. I'm not taking it seriously.

1301
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I'm not going, hey, this is an awesome new dance franchise from Konami. I just see this as, oh my god, this pile of shit is gonna be stinking up my room.

1302
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,000
But I'm gonna check it out for the sake of the show. Taking one for the team, if you will.

1303
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news. The classic game of the week is just up ahead.

1304
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yes, with Halloween right around the corner, apparently Sony is allowing you to download some free movies.

1305
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You can check out some free midnight movie rentals on your Playstation 3.

1306
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:27,000
They are available for a very select period of time. In fact, this weekend they had Bram Stoker's Dracula.

1307
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That was available from 5pm on the 16th to 3am on the 17th.

1308
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Next week they're gonna have Savage County, same time frame, 5pm on October 23rd to 3am on October 24th.

1309
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And also, of course, Nightmare on Elm Street, the original one.

1310
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:54,000
That's gonna be available on actually Halloween from 5pm on October 30th to 3am on October 31st.

1311
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I think that's kinda cool. They should really do that just with random movies all throughout the year. Not necessarily horror movies.

1312
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Maybe it's a trial thing.

1313
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I think it's a good idea to get people excited about that. And also for people that maybe have downloaded a lot of movies from their service and then got ripped off and their movies went bye-bye and they had to fight them tooth and nail.

1314
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
The phone calls we've had on the show before.

1315
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:24,000
What about, are these movies hosted by Elvira? Because I'm sorry, it's not a true Halloween midnight movie spectacular without Elvira hosting.

1316
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Dude, that would be awesome. They should have some sort of hosted stuff.

1317
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Sadly I could actually tell you. She's in a new movie called All About Evil, but she's actually Cassandra Peterson.

1318
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Her normal self is in this movie All About Evil that's directed by Peaches Christ, who is a drag queen in San Francisco.

1319
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's like a... Alan and I kinda wanna go see it.

1320
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That's kinda something cool. They should do that though for like, say, instead of this...

1321
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
What was it?

1322
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Here, download a movie for free. Put a little work into it to make it awesome.

1323
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Not necessarily that, but actually have it where you can watch a movie with friends and stuff. But do it like 1 vs 100.

1324
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Have a theater full of people, have it hosted by Elvira or something like that.

1325
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Mystery Science Theater type of thing.

1326
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
The last Elvira experience I had was playing Pimple.

1327
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But then you can even chat to friends and stuff like that.

1328
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Or here is a novel concept, Sony. I'm gonna give you some consulting advice for free.

1329
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Here is how to make people interested in shit they were never interested in before on Sony.

1330
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Do it all in Sony Home. Play the movie in the theater on Sony Home and everybody could actually be in the theater.

1331
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And you could have a live host up on the stage being a dork and doing the whole riff tracks thing.

1332
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And it's something new and kind of cool.

1333
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And then pay Orange Lounge $5,000 for the idea.

1334
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I gave that to Sony for free.

1335
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But we want the money anyway.

1336
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
You can put me and Sony Home for that free advice. There you go.

1337
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But seriously, I'm surprised that they haven't done something like that Rocky Horror Picture Show with you.

1338
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Rob can have no neck.

1339
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Frisbee in the chat room says throw virtual popcorn at the screen.

1340
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Amazing idea. Your avatars could...

1341
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
With the move.

1342
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I'm just trying to picture the time warp.

1343
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I could just see some total asshats though that would just sit there the whole time flailing around on their move and just popcorns flying everywhere.

1344
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
The entire movie.

1345
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
That's fine. But like you get points for hitting your props at the right cue?

1346
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Like you press A for, you know, squirt gun?

1347
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Let's see. Going to some comments from the chat room. Tigerclaw was saying Elvira needs her own video game.

1348
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And he actually did follow up saying, you know what, there really was an Elvira game.

1349
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I don't know if it's the same one he linked. I'm not even going to look because I do remember an older PC game.

1350
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And I think there was even one on like the Commodore 64. Like really that old.

1351
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
But there was an Elvira video game that was kind of like an adventure game.

1352
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And it actually had like, there was like gore in it and stuff. It was very kind of like, from what I remember it was a very kind of core-ish game.

1353
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I think this is it.

1354
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Telltale Games. We have a new franchise for you.

1355
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Actually that's very cool. I like that idea.

1356
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Alright. Let's see.

1357
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
There were I think three Elvira pinball tables.

1358
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Mike. Mike again.

1359
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
There were three, I believe, Elvira pinball tables.

1360
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Defective Candy in our chat room says, that virtual popcorn idea they use in Gaia online and they are total asshats at it.

1361
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And yes, I used to play Gaia.

1362
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I still have my Gaia account in that picture.

1363
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Okay. I used to play Gaia. My account is still active. And yes, you can go buy stuff from the little vendor to throw at the screen.

1364
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Good times.

1365
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Sj100 Matt says, Rob, would you host a Rocky Horror Night in home or in the OLR house?

1366
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Absolutely.

1367
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Sony, call me or whatever. It'll be fun. Why not? I will whore myself out for the sake of publicizing this show.

1368
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And the All Games Network, of course.

1369
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I would even do it for free the first time.

1370
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You get a freebie the first time. The rest of the time you have to pay for his whore mouth.

1371
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
That's right.

1372
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Ah, yeah. Okay. Anyhow, it's a cool idea that hopefully will get cooler.

1373
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Anyhow, let's talk about something that...

1374
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Okay, your boyfriend gets kudos from me.

1375
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Why? What'd he do?

1376
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
For saying that scared stiff was the best of the Elvira table.

1377
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Oh, he loves the Elvira pinball game.

1378
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Ah, so great.

1379
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
There's several of them.

1380
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
There's three.

1381
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
There's a two layer play field that was really cool.

1382
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Good times. You know what pinball FX2 needs? Elvira table.

1383
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Elvira.

1384
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But the only problem with Elvira is she's getting kind of old.

1385
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Elvira.

1386
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
That Elvira's probably dead.

1387
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I like how we're all laughing at this and poor Loki's looking at us like, you people are weird.

1388
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
But seeing you know with the magic of technology now we can have you know old Elvira and new Elvira.

1389
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Well I don't know if you know but they actually did a reality show on sci-fi network that was the next Elvira.

1390
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Where they were trying to cast the next Elvira and you know some girl won but they didn't do anything with it.

1391
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
There's still old Elvira.

1392
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Sorry you lose. There is no replacement for Elvira.

1393
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Exactly.

1394
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
As long as there's plastic surgery and makeup we'll always have our Elvira.

1395
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
That's right.

1396
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Okay let me move on here to Blizzard and some stuff going on at Blizzard and Starcraft 2. This isn't about WoW although I will say the Cataclysm cinematic is now online and it had its little preview during the NFL game tonight and the full one is online and it is epic epicness.

1397
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:14,000
If you are a WoW player you get to see the Thousand Needles being flooded. You get to see Deathwing landing on Stormwind and putting his claws into the castle and you get to see Ashenvale and any alliance player will love this because you get to see Ashenvale get just destroyed.

1398
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I'm sorry not Ashenvale, Aberdeen. You can see Aberdeen get destroyed. I'm a bad WoW player sorry.

1399
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Aberdeen just gets destroyed in the trailer it's great.

1400
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Isn't that where they keep cows?

1401
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Aberdeen. Why do you always have to beat up the cows?

1402
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
No I wasn't beating up the cows this time.

1403
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
To be fair there are no cows in Aberdeen she's crazy.

1404
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
No that's where the Angus cows come from.

1405
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Not in the game. All the cows are in us elven forest.

1406
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Is this spelled like actual Aberdeen?

1407
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Forest cows that's ridiculous. It's a video game people.

1408
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
You just kept making me think of Scotland.

1409
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Let me move on to Starcraft 2 news because that's what this is really about.

1410
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
It's about Starcraft 2. Blizzard is actually going to be suing the cheat makers.

1411
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Five thousand people were busted previously by Blizzard for cheating in Starcraft 2.

1412
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Well Blizzard is actually going to take the people who made the cheats to court.

1413
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
They are taking three men to court for making those hacks.

1414
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Just days after the release of Starcraft 2 defendants already had developed, marketed, and distributed to the public a variety of hacks and cheats designed to modify and in fact destroy the Starcraft 2 online gaming experience says this lawsuit.

1415
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:34,000
In fact on the very day that Starcraft 2 was released representatives of the hack's website advised members of the public that our staff is already planning on new releases for the game.

1416
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The accused are being accused of multiple counts of copyright infringement.

1417
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Blizzard wants damages and a cut of the money that the three received from selling the hacks.

1418
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
That was your problem.

1419
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Two of these people are from Canada. One of them is from Peru.

1420
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Blame Peru.

1421
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
It doesn't have the same ring to it.

1422
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
It doesn't have the same ring to it. I'm sorry to say that.

1423
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
So we'll see what happens with this.

1424
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Probably be a settlement and these guys will get sued to oblivion. We'll see. Although the international part of it makes it very interesting.

1425
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Blizzard is also warning people who want to cheat with Starcraft, use these trainers at your own risk.

1426
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:18,000
This is because Blizzard has suspended some accounts because some folks have been exploiting.

1427
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And there was a guy on this website Cheat Happens that was reporting that they were banned from using a trainer in single player.

1428
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,000
See, I have a problem with that. Because if you want to cheat in a single player game, who are you hurting?

1429
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Well here's the thing. Blizzard did want to clarify on what's going on here.

1430
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Blizzard Entertainment is not banning Starcraft 2 players just for using single player cheats.

1431
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
There's been some confusion in the last couple days about the suspensions and bans meted out to players caught cheating in Starcraft 2.

1432
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It's important to point out first that many of the third party hacks and cheats developed for Starcraft 2 contain both single and multiplayer functionality.

1433
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:04,000
In order to protect the integrity of multiplayer competition, we are actively detecting cheat programs used in multiplayer modes whether they are human opponents or not.

1434
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
That said, players who opt to use any type of third party hacks do so at their own risk.

1435
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
There are built in cheat codes for Starcraft 2 single player that can be used safely.

1436
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Blizzard has always taken cheating seriously and will continue to aggressively crack down on players who cheat in our games.

1437
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Keep in mind, Blizzard also has an achievement system that even works in single player and I imagine these cheat codes disable those.

1438
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:38,000
They probably don't like the idea of these other exploits making the achievements easier to get because it gives the wrong perception as to what kind of skills someone has on Starcraft.

1439
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So something to keep in mind.

1440
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So after hearing that, does that change your mind?

1441
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Loki, that Blizzard doesn't really want to ban the single player cheaters, it's just the fact that most of them are multiplayer as well?

1442
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
They'll find ways around it.

1443
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
They always do one way or another, don't they?

1444
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to another time when folks weren't banned en masse by cheating on video games and talk about the classic video game of the week.

1445
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Dark soccer is going to take a stroll to the vault and pull out an old dusty moldy video game that she says,

1446
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Hey, you brats, you need to respect this video game or die.

1447
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
So dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1448
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:31,000
The game of the week is Ikari Warriors, which was also known as Ikari in Japan, which means furious.

1449
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:42,000
This is very, very cool. It used rotary joysticks and had a two player mode and it has Ralph and Clark that later showed up in the King of Fighters series.

1450
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Which we know Ralph and Clark, don't we?

1451
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
They also make an appearance in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7.

1452
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
At any rate, you are Ralph and Clark, these commando dudes, and they're trying to reach the village of Ikari.

1453
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And basically you get attacked with tanks and soldiers and helicopters, but you get power ups on the way.

1454
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Because power ups really do show up in real life when you're trying to charge the village of furious.

1455
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,000
At any rate, this was one of the first major games, like I said, to use a rotary joystick.

1456
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Which, like I said, you can rotate as well as push in different directions.

1457
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And your buttons, one of them was your gun and the other one was for throwing grenades so you could blow them up.

1458
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And it also was fully cooperative, one of the early games to do that, and had vehicles in it.

1459
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,000
So, they actually did an SNK pinout and they did a JAMA pinout.

1460
01:45:48,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So, for people with the arcade SNK machines, it worked in those.

1461
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:13,000
And it was really cool. It had different things in it that they had to edit out for the US version.

1462
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:24,000
The guy that you rescue in the Japanese version is General Kawasaki, who was named after SNK's former president Eikichi Kawasaki.

1463
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And it was Colonel Cook in the US ones after Tradewest, founder Leland Cook.

1464
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And the enemies in the game, though, were supposed to be Neo-Nazis.

1465
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So, they suck.

1466
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:44,000
There was a DOS version that came out, and there were sequels.

1467
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
There was Victory Road, also in 1986, and Ikari 3 The Rescue.

1468
01:46:51,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And then there was also a Guerrilla War arcade called Guevara in Japan that used a similar type of gameplay that featured Che Guevara and Fidel Castro as the main guys.

1469
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:16,000
As for the other versions that came out, there was the NES version, Apple II, DOS, Atari ST, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Armstrad CPC.

1470
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
The NES version was so glitched out.

1471
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I agree.

1472
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
But ABBA was a code.

1473
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Yes.

1474
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
That made the game awesome.

1475
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
There was an MSX version of it and different 16-bit versions that came out.

1476
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
There's actually two different Commodore 64 version R.O.B.s.

1477
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I was saying two R.O.B.s.

1478
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
One was put out by Data East and the other one was by Elite.

1479
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Interesting, because I don't really remember one of them. I had one of them.

1480
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I remember this game.

1481
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Yeah, the Atari ST and Amiga versions were supposed to have better graphics and sound effects.

1482
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And the NES version was developed by Micronix.

1483
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
And the problem with the NES one is it was flashy, flashy, flash, flash, flash.

1484
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Glitch-tastic.

1485
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But it's a cool game.

1486
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:11,000
We had some problems with our characters being stuck in different layers of sprites, so it was actually running under the map or something like that.

1487
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Then we kept getting the game dirtier and dirtier just to see what glitches we could get.

1488
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I love the NES.

1489
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
That's it.

1490
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1491
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
And I'll tell you how I picked it.

1492
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I went in the vault, grabbed one of the bins, and put my finger on a game.

1493
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
That's how I picked it.

1494
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
That's how you picked it. That's how she does it, folks.

1495
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
But I approve because, again, any game that uses ABBA as a code is awesome.

1496
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Are they dancing queens?

1497
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I cannot imagine Ralph and Clark doing disco dancing.

1498
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Contrary to what Spaznator is saying in chat, ABBA will not play an 8-bit version of Dancing Queen.

1499
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Although, I think that should be in a future game.

1500
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
What do I know, though?

1501
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Alright, so that's going to wrap up this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1502
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
There is plenty more to come in Part B.

1503
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
We've got more news, lots and lots of good stuff, Twitter topics.

1504
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
And tonight, I'm so excited because Jessica's here.

1505
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
We thought we'd do something special.

1506
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
We're going to do List List tonight with Jessica.

1507
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And the topic tonight, you ready for this?

1508
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Because Jessica's got to think about this because I'm springing this on her during break.

1509
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Here we go.

1510
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:22,000
The topic tonight, the thing I learned most from DDR Freak, is tonight's List List topic.

1511
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
The thing I learned most from DDR Freak.

1512
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
It's going to be a fun night, ladies and gentlemen.

1513
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1514
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1515
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
We are live on October the 17th of 2010 with the 386th episode of our show.

1516
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
We're a super fast computer, if this is 1982.

1517
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Or 1992, excuse me, a 386, there you go.

1518
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I had a 38620.

1519
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
My first PC was a 386SX16.

1520
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And that's running in turbo mode, otherwise it's a 38616.

1521
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
With, get this, a 30 megabyte hard drive.

1522
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh my god.

1523
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
And one megabyte of RAM.

1524
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Holy shit.

1525
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Running Windows 3.1.

1526
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Actually I think it was 3.0 at that time.

1527
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
My friend's dad is an engineer back in the 40s.

1528
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And he was talking about one time we were visiting and he was saying that they lined the room in magnets to make 1K of memory.

1529
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Wow.

1530
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Think about that.

1531
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And now what are we running? We got, just, you can go spend, you know, 90 bucks and get a terabyte hard drive.

1532
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
No problem.

1533
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
For and for all.

1534
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
If you're just joining us after this break, the other voice you hear there is our lovely guest tonight, Jessica Harper from Understation Live.

1535
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
But we remember her as Iguana Girl from DDR Freak.

1536
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I'm sorry, Iguana Girl.

1537
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Iguana Girl.

1538
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Iguana Girl. So there you go. And she's here tonight because she's helping us reminisce about the good old days of DDR and all that.

1539
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And you know, kind of where are they now? And we definitely found out some interesting stuff in part A about the behind the scenes operations of DDR Freak.

1540
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Now I know what types of questions not to ask moving forward.

1541
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:26,000
But I don't know how much you can kind of say about this, but I know you eventually stepped down as an administrator of DDR Freak, as most people do.

1542
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
You know, these things kind of come in cycles. There's only so much time you can give up.

1543
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:36,000
But what do you kind of think about where like DDR Freak is at now? Do you think it's kind of like past its prime, it's old and dead and gone?

1544
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Dead. Yeah, there's still a few people that are straggling in there, but even Random Chat, which is the absolute most frequented forum, it will go a full day without any kind of hits at all at this point.

1545
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I tried looking back like six months ago and was completely depressed.

1546
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Yeah, there's the occasional where are they now type of thread, but pretty much what's going on at this point is just eh.

1547
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
What happened? It used to be the place to be.

1548
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I think that most of it is just the mainstream nature of DDR has kind of killed it a bit.

1549
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
And a lot of the old school people don't necessarily like the new class, so to speak.

1550
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And I think that, you know, just overall the site started getting slower and slower, started having issues and people just weren't as interested anymore.

1551
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Sadly, you're probably right. And I think probably Konami's lack of support for DDR for a very long time probably contributed to that.

1552
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Yeah, definitely. So that's a bummer.

1553
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Are there any other forums that you surf these days that we can find you on?

1554
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Not particularly. Most of what I do is just, you know, I sit and play on Facebook most of the time.

1555
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Good times.

1556
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Yeah, I already have a group of friends. I'm not really necessarily looking to go search out a whole new group of friends or anything, so I just kind of do my own thing.

1557
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
But you can at least be found Saturday nights at Under Station Live right here at All Games Radio.

1558
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Yes, and I do also have a Facebook that is my public Facebook for Under Station Live.

1559
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You can find me under Jessica Harper on Facebook if you want to add me.

1560
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And I'll sometimes post, you know, interesting pictures and what have you through that. So, yeah, kind of a, you know, an online version of me.

1561
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Alright. Check that out. Sounds good. Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick news.

1562
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I do want to say though first, since, you know, Jessica's our guest this week, we already have a guest lined up for next week as well.

1563
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It's like suddenly we're like the month of guests. I like this because it's another in-studio guest, which is very exciting.

1564
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Segg is going to be here next week. Oops. Apparently Segg has theme music. Sorry about that.

1565
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Fail on my part. The music bag, er, the mailbag music aired a little early.

1566
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Segg is going to be here next week and he's going to talk all about Umlaud, which is his big, and if you've been listening to the show for a while, you probably heard him on the show last year.

1567
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:03,000
But this time he's going to come in-studio so he can actually talk to us throughout the night and definitely pimp Umlaud, which is going on, well it's not going on right now,

1568
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:10,000
but the pre-antics are going on right now on the website. Umlaud.org. It's a fundraiser, of course, for Child's Play.

1569
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It's going to happen in San Francisco in December. All the details are there at Umlaud.org. You don't even have to know how to type the Umlaud.

1570
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
When is it, Ian?

1571
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
It is December...

1572
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
They're going to be running Rock Band 3 this time?

1573
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Yeah, I believe so. We're going to get all the details from Segg next week, so I don't want to spoil everything, but I believe it's December 9th?

1574
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:37,000
It's a Thursday. I remember that because it got bumped up because last year it was on like a Monday and now it's a bigger deal this year, so it's actually on a Thursday.

1575
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
So we've got to ask about that. Ooh, I got the date right. It is December 9th, 2010.

1576
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
And yes, I do believe Rock Band 3 is a part of it as well. We're going to get all the details.

1577
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:52,000
There's going to be some big, big, big band package deals that weren't around last year. We're going to talk about that as well.

1578
01:54:52,000 --> 01:55:03,000
If you're not in the San Francisco Bay Area and you don't feel like driving or flying out here for it, you still can donate online. Umlaud.org. U-M-L-O-U-D dot O-R-G for all the details.

1579
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
He will be here next week again to give us all the nitty-gritty about it.

1580
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:18,000
And Segg also happens to work for one of the big developers that we like here at All Games Radio, and we're going to talk to him about that as much as we can.

1581
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I mean, you know, there's these old NDAs and things.

1582
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
And pitch him our idea for the Elvira adventure game.

1583
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:34,000
He's listening right now, so he might have heard it. But yes, we'll try to pitch him our ideas, and at least the games that are out, we can hopefully ask some good questions on and all that stuff. So that'll be good.

1584
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
So we're going to talk to him about all that fun stuff next week. It's something to look forward to.

1585
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I like this whole, like, having guests every week thing. You know, we had Tiara a couple weeks ago, and now we have Guana Girl, Jessica Harper's here tonight, and then we've got Segg next week.

1586
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:56,000
This is great. We've got to get some more game developers in here, too. I don't know if we can get them to travel all the way out the sack, but we know the Skype thing works okay.

1587
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Alright, anyhow.

1588
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
They can sleep on my couch.

1589
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
That's right. Come pimp your game and sleep on the couch.

1590
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick, quick, quick news.

1591
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:14,000
By the way, if you haven't gotten your Twitter topics in, now is a great time, and I would really encourage, since we do have Jessica here in studio, and we are talking a lot about the old-school days,

1592
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
definitely if you have Twitter questions about the old-school days, we'd love to hear it, although we will happily take any topic.

1593
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Get those tweets in right now. You've got about five minutes, five to ten minutes, while we do some fast news.

1594
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
And if you don't submit tweets, I'm going to let Jessica just tweet all night.

1595
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Tweet, tweet!

1596
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
And then I'll play the Rockin' Robin song, and then let her do the tweet, tweet.

1597
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Tweet, tweet, tweet!

1598
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Exactly. Alright, in the meantime, quick news. Logan.

1599
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Oh my god, you better run out in a hurry and pick up Outrun Online Arcade, because if you procrastinate for another 13 months, then you may not be able to get it.

1600
01:56:52,000 --> 01:57:00,000
That's right, because apparently their license agreement with Ferrari is going to be up, and so because of that, it's going to be taken offline.

1601
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:07,000
No offense, but I think at that point, no one's going to remember that that game ever came out, and it probably won't matter.

1602
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:14,000
But yes, see at first when I first read this, I didn't realize it was 2011, I'm like, oh okay, well a couple months, then maybe we should act now.

1603
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But a year and a couple months? Eh.

1604
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,000
But it's Outrun! Like, I don't have 50 million other versions of Outrun.

1605
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:34,000
It's a bummer that it's getting pulled for kind of a, well I mean it's an understandable reason, but also at the same time it's kind of dumb, but at least it's not getting pulled because it sucks.

1606
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
For her it's just like, we have loads of cash, we are Italian, go ahead and have it.

1607
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
They shouldn't be dicks is really what it comes down to.

1608
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Back to the Future apparently is getting a brand new release, the 25th anniversary trilogy that's coming out on Blu-Ray.

1609
01:57:54,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Also with that though, if you happen to purchase that, a voucher for a free episode of Telltale's new game.

1610
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
That's right, the Back to the Future video game, and not the crappy one that was on the NES.

1611
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I liked that one.

1612
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
But you will agree, it was crappy.

1613
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
It was crappy, it's like, you know, it was the E.T.

1614
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
It wasn't so bad, Back to the Future 2 and 3 was the E.T. of the NES.

1615
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,000
The Back to the Future pinball was really good though, except Michael J. Fox would not let people use his likeness so it's somebody else on there.

1616
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
There are, is it Eric Stoltz?

1617
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
No, I don't think it's Eric Stoltz.

1618
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,000
There are all these kind of old NES games, everybody has that old school 8-bit NES game that really sucks, but you still love it.

1619
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
You know what I mean?

1620
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Yeah.

1621
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Anyway, sorry.

1622
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Anyways.

1623
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
But the Back to the Future is kind of a big deal. The Blu-Ray is kind of a big deal, it's getting a lot of like-

1624
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
You know what's kind of weird though?

1625
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Is they've already given away the coupon code, I guess.

1626
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I don't know if it's going to be exclusive to each one or if it's this thing, but it says apparently there is a picture of the actual code thing.

1627
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It says, the URL insert lists the URL for redeeming the included code one two one gigawatts, which currently directs the browsers to the game's homepage.

1628
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:22,000
It says, of course, it will go live as they get closer to it.

1629
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:33,000
So, I don't know if one point two or one two one gigawatt is going to be the code, but hey, something a little extra if you buy Back to the Future.

1630
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
And you should, because it's an awesome movie series and they keep replaying it on G4 for some reason.

1631
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
And I'm pretty sure the game this time will be much better than the NES one. Just call it a hunch.

1632
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Oh, yeah.

1633
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Because they have Christopher Lloyd actually doing voice acting and all that, right?

1634
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Yes.

1635
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Get him to say as many things as possible before he dies. I mean, seriously, just have him read the whole dictionary and we'll be done with it.

1636
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
He was a Klingon once.

1637
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
That's interesting.

1638
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Yes.

1639
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
He should host a science show as Doc Brown.

1640
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That would be awesome.

1641
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Saig is actually in our chat tonight. Happy to hear about his appearance. He's actually saying that theaters are going to be showing Back to the Future at the end of this month.

1642
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I guess it's like a revival thing.

1643
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
That's awesome.

1644
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
No, but seriously though, Christopher Lloyd needs to host a sideshow. Screw Bill Nye.

1645
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Can I be honest about something though? I've never seen the original Back to the Future the whole way through, actually.

1646
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
What?

1647
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I haven't.

1648
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Here's the funny thing. I've seen the third movie the whole way through because they showed it like when I was in seventh grade on VHS or whatever.

1649
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I have never seen the original movie the whole way through.

1650
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I saw the first one in the theater, the third one in the theater, and I didn't see the second one until I was an adult.

1651
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
There's always that one movie you miss as a kid, except I missed a few.

1652
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
What was your first movie, Rob?

1653
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
My first movie?

1654
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Do you remember? Were you told?

1655
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I was told that I was taken to see The Empire Strikes Back at the 99 cent theater.

1656
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
We kind of have something in common then. My first movie was Star Wars.

1657
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Oh, there you go.

1658
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:20,000
The earliest movie I can remember that I saw as I remember waiting in line for opening night for the Masters of the Universe.

1659
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I remember going to see the Care Bears movie. That's probably the first movie I remember seeing.

1660
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Care Bears in Wonderland was great.

1661
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Or Return to Oz. Good God.

1662
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
That movie was awesome.

1663
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
What was your first movie?

1664
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
E.T. at the Drive-In.

1665
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I'm pretty sure you saw E.T., but the one I can only remember.

1666
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I saw E.T. in the theater.

1667
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
E.T. was probably before all that.

1668
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I was what? Five? Six?

1669
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I also remember going to see The Aristocats by Disney.

1670
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
The first movie that I saw four times in a row, though, was Wrath of Khan.

1671
02:01:50,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I remember also we went to a drive-in to see, it was a double feature, Shrimp on the Barbie and Batman.

1672
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:07,000
And I really wanted to see Batman, and unfortunately Shrimp on the Barbie was...

1673
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
The fuck do those two movies have in common?

1674
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
They always do that.

1675
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I have no idea, but for some reason, I fell asleep through Batman.

1676
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:21,000
And I woke up, I'm like, where's Batman?

1677
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,000
And my mom's like, we tried to wake you up, but you said you wanted to sleep.

1678
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I'm like, no, I didn't!

1679
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Aww.

1680
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I eventually saw it later on, but no, it was kind of funny, though.

1681
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Shrimp on the Barbie, yes, that would put you to sleep, I can imagine.

1682
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,000
But that must have been the second movie, for some reason, because I slept through Batman.

1683
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Anyways, sorry, since we were talking about movies, though, there of course is rumors that the Uncharted movie needs to move forward.

1684
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:59,000
People want this to become a movie, because I guess the game lends itself well to a movie.

1685
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And funny enough, the main character, which has been compared to Nathan Fillion,

1686
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:14,000
actually now Nathan Fillion is trying to start a campaign on Twitter to be cast as Nathan Drake.

1687
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
So that's interesting, because I guess he looks kind of like the main character.

1688
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
He does a little bit, but I don't know.

1689
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I don't see the entire resemblance there, but he sort of, I mean, it could work.

1690
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
There'd be fanboys that would be very happy if that were to happen, that's cool.

1691
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I don't know, I'd drool.

1692
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Dan's only too old.

1693
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Yeah, Dan's piping in from the other end.

1694
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
You're right, Danny Glover needs to be Nathan Drake.

1695
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's okay, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

1696
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Let's get Betty White to be Nathan Drake.

1697
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Dan says, should do.

1698
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Dan approves of Betty White.

1699
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You need to cast Betty White in like a big blockbuster action flick.

1700
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I still want to see Red, because, I mean, can you imagine Helen Mirren with an AK?

1701
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Here you go, an action movie starring Betty White called Grandma Death.

1702
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
I would go see it.

1703
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
You know what, no no no.

1704
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
That's awesome.

1705
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Well, keep in mind, they did the machete movie, remember?

1706
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
That's true, there you go.

1707
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
You know, the movie based off of a trailer of a non-existent movie?

1708
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
They could do another Grindhouse movie with Betty White in it.

1709
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Grandma Death?

1710
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
It'd be like Kill Bill, but it's Betty White.

1711
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Great.

1712
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Hopefully she does all her own stunts.

1713
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Too bad Barbara Billingsley is dead, because she could be her co-star.

1714
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Well, you know what, only if she talked jive.

1715
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
If as long as she gets her before she starts to decompose, it might be alright.

1716
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I actually, I watched an interview of her about learning to talk jive, by the way.

1717
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
So did I.

1718
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Yours would be a bit like Kill Ernest.

1719
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Ernest Borgnine.

1720
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Yeah.

1721
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
That would be awesome.

1722
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Let's move on with some news.

1723
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I don't know how we got onto this whole like, Betty White and Ernest goes together.

1724
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Actually, you need to go color Bill, so it's Betty White plus Grandma Death.

1725
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Grandma Death plus Kill Bill equals profit.

1726
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Alright, let's move on.

1727
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Crazy.

1728
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
It's Crazy Dexy.

1729
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
It's coming out on November 23rd on the PlayStation Network.

1730
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
November 24th on Xbox Live Arcade.

1731
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
If you're ready to get some crazy money, it's gonna cost you 10 bucks.

1732
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
It will be widescreen.

1733
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
It will have 720p high def graphics.

1734
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
It will not have the offspring music, sadly.

1735
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And it will not have Pizza Hut.

1736
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Sorry.

1737
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Will it have bad religion?

1738
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
All the licensed crap is gone.

1739
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
They are cheap. They are super duper cheap.

1740
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Wow, what's left? Because I mean that game was all licensed crap.

1741
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Just the whole driving down that hill.

1742
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Duh duh duh.

1743
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
All these games have an options menu where you can turn down the music.

1744
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So what you do is turn down whatever crap music they end up putting in the game.

1745
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
And then do a Xbox 360 custom soundtrack.

1746
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Why didn't they get new licensing?

1747
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
They did get new licensing. I'm sure KFC would do it in like, you know, Old Navy or something.

1748
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Take me to Old Navy!

1749
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
No, bitch! Off the pier!

1750
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
You're driving too fast!

1751
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Take me to the Gap! Not until they change the logo, bitch!

1752
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
They did. They fixed it.

1753
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
No, seriously, get this. Not even that.

1754
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Because we were talking, for some reason, my non-designer friends were talking about typography with me.

1755
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
And I was like, yeah, they were using Helvetica and it was ugly, a bad use of Helvetica.

1756
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,000
And so I went to find it and there's no more pictures of it online, except for the Gap logo sucks Twitter.

1757
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Yeah, it's gone.

1758
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
They hunted that shit down.

1759
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
You know, a kind of interesting point in chat, what if all the licenses had been stuff that is now gone?

1760
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Like, take me to Tower Records!

1761
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
That would be sad.

1762
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
That would be sadness.

1763
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Take me to Tower Records! I mean, Dimple!

1764
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
No, they're still there.

1765
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

1766
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Take me to Tower Records! No, I mean R5! No, I mean Dimple!

1767
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Or what other big things have closed down lately that just all went under?

1768
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Take me to Mervins!

1769
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Can't.

1770
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Montgomery Wards!

1771
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Alright, anyhow.

1772
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Rock band news.

1773
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Take me to L&L BBQ!

1774
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Take me to L&L BBQ!

1775
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
There's a whole list of rock band songs available in this little web widget that you can embed in your site.

1776
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
It's in celebration of the 2000th song to hit rock band.

1777
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
You know, going to find research online can be kind of tough.

1778
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
There's a whole little widget that made its way to a lot of gaming blogs.

1779
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
And the cool thing is you can search, you can sort it by artist, you can sort it by year, you can sort it by the genre.

1780
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
And it's just basically like a quick online little web widget to find the finder.

1781
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
So if you want to see, okay, Lady Gaga.

1782
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Why am I not surprised?

1783
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
There are four Lady Gaga songs in the game.

1784
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
He's gay!

1785
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
What's your point?

1786
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
And then there's one Eric Cartman Lady Gaga song that's in there.

1787
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Oh that's great.

1788
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
There you go.

1789
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
One more story for you guys, another music game.

1790
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
DJ Hero 2 is getting some download contents.

1791
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
The first comes in November is the first pack.

1792
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
It's going to be the Hit Makers Mix Pack.

1793
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Rihanna's Umbrella vs Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.

1794
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
That might be kind of interesting.

1795
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Two weeks later an Electro Hits Mix Pack.

1796
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
That might be kind of awesome actually.

1797
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:36,000
There's also, actually the Electro Hits has LMFAO with I'm in Miami trick, because they have to change the lyrics.

1798
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Mixed with Green Velvet, Shake and Pop.

1799
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Some of this might be kind of awesome actually.

1800
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,000
So that's all coming out in November.

1801
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:53,000
By the way, there will also be a free compatibility update in November to enable support for the existing DJ Hero DLC in DJ Hero 2.

1802
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Which is great because the best DJ Hero song was that Mary J. Blige All of Me vs Queen Radio Gaga.

1803
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
There was no better song in the game and it was downloads.

1804
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
That was pretty fantastic.

1805
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Rob, let's make that our after show music.

1806
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Maybe. If I can find it.

1807
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1808
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I have stuff. Things. How about some Guitar Hero stuff?

1809
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I don't think this is enough to save them though, even though I think it's amazing.

1810
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:32,000
There is going to be a free 3-pack for Gold members that has Disturbs the Infection, Muses Resistance, cool song.

1811
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
My Chemical Romance's Na Na Na, another band that I like.

1812
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:41,000
It will be available to be purchased by Silver Live users on October 19th.

1813
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
And then on the 26th of October there will be a Rocky Horror Picture Show pack.

1814
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:54,000
And that's pretty cool. It has Time Warp, and Sweet Transvestite, and Hot Patootie.

1815
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
And also completely unrelated is Soundgarden's Telefantasm.

1816
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Sadly not enough to get me to spend $60 on the game, but I think it's really cool.

1817
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
And it also reminds me that the Rocky Horror Blu-ray is out, I believe, this Tuesday.

1818
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
So I kind of want to check that out because I'm curious how it turned out.

1819
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
You know, I was saying that that's the only thing that's probably going to remotely get me to watch that show that starts with a G that I don't like.

1820
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And imagine that. Exactly 10 years after they released the DVD, they released the Blu-ray.

1821
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Here comes the Blu-ray. And apparently it's got a live shadow cast thing going on in it and all this stuff.

1822
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Picture in picture. Could be interesting. I don't know. I'm curious.

1823
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And don't think this whole Rocky Horror Glee thing isn't a cross promotion.

1824
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I will bet money there's a commercial for the Blu-ray during the Glee episode.

1825
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Although, you know what I really, really want to see? What?

1826
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Is Tony Head as Frank.

1827
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
We got to see that at that same convention we played.

1828
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Because I understand that he brought his own gear.

1829
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:00,000
You might still be able to catch it and they'll probably play it a little bit closer but the H1, they were actually filming a karaoke version.

1830
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:07,000
You can probably find it on YouTube actually. Of Anthony Head playing Frank.

1831
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,000
He's so great. I loved the single that he did. That was really great.

1832
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I'm positive you can find that on YouTube.

1833
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I'm going to be looking something up tonight when I'm supposed to be doing my homework.

1834
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Alan very much wants me to watch that Rocky Horror Glee episode.

1835
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I think Glee is okay. I watched about half the first season and it's fine.

1836
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,000
But I really am not liking this idea of them doing the Rocky Horror because I know it's just going to be hard to watch.

1837
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Have you actually watched the stuff that Richard's been posting?

1838
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I've heard some of the songs that were posted.

1839
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Watch some of the stuff. I do not watch Glee at all. I will never watch Glee after this.

1840
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
But I'll probably watch this one.

1841
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I heard the way they did Sweet Transvestite and I'm not a fan.

1842
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I like the Dammit Janet and some of the other stuff though.

1843
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
But I'm curious. I will watch it.

1844
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
But Alan's like, you need to sit there and live blog it and tape your eyes open. You gotta watch the whole thing.

1845
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
And I'm just kind of like, only if you do too because he hates Glee.

1846
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I have to say I did look at the stills they had and the sets and costumes looked pretty awesome.

1847
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I don't like that they had to dumb it down for broadcast TV.

1848
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I understand you can't have a teenager or somebody portraying a teenager running around in the Rocky costume. I get that. That's fine.

1849
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
But they really really washed down some of the lyrics.

1850
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Sensational Transylvania. Really?

1851
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
It kind of defeats the point, honey.

1852
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Whatever. Oh well. I'll watch it and it won't be that bad.

1853
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I think it would be more interesting to visit transsexual than sensational.

1854
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I should be happy that at least it's getting attention and it'll bring more curious kids to the Midnight movie.

1855
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And then it'll die off like it always does.

1856
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Yes. But at least we'll have that moment.

1857
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,000
But, by the way, they are doing a Rocky Horror show downtown right now.

1858
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Oh really? I don't want to go.

1859
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I have no idea.

1860
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I'll have to send you guys the invite so you can look.

1861
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Please do.

1862
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Because it started this past weekend all the way through until Halloween.

1863
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Let's go.

1864
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I kind of want to go. I have no idea.

1865
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Remember we saw when ARC put it on.

1866
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
That was cute.

1867
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
That was great.

1868
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
We should all go.

1869
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
We'll have a group date.

1870
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Alan won't mind if I take two women out.

1871
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
You'll have to have him a threesome.

1872
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
It's Sister Wives Night.

1873
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
You'll take your harem out.

1874
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Alright. What else, DarkSagra?

1875
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Oh, other news.

1876
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Dead Space is going to be coming out on the iPad.

1877
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
It will be out in December according to EA.

1878
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:51,000
They're saying that there's a big press event at Tokyo's Apple Store that will be featuring this.

1879
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
And it's a third person shooter.

1880
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,000
No rails. No changing modes. Nothing said about the iPhone.

1881
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
So maybe it will be better than the Xbox Live Arcade version.

1882
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Who cares?

1883
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Xbox Live Arcade, other news, is in nine more countries now.

1884
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Starting on the 10th of November.

1885
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Maybe not now, but in the future.

1886
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
It will be in Russia, Poland, Russia.

1887
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:26,000
South Africa, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile.

1888
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Welcome to the wave of the future.

1889
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
I mean, the wave of four years ago.

1890
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And for the record, I actually sat and watched four hours of the mine rescue and it was amazing.

1891
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Did you? I did.

1892
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I couldn't tear my eyes off of it like the very first night.

1893
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I must go to bed, but it's 2 a.m., but I have to see number seven.

1894
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I read about it on CNN. I didn't watch a minute of it.

1895
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:56,000
You know what I thought was awesome about it is that it totally wasn't the overblown media circus that it would have been in America.

1896
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
And the freaking president came out by himself without guards or anything to help with the effort.

1897
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
To be there with the families. And that was cool.

1898
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I was reminded of, pardon the pun, baby Jessica.

1899
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Watching that whole thing. Remember?

1900
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Back in the day. Back in the day.

1901
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Way before most of our listeners were born.

1902
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,000
You know what? I read an interview with her where she grew up and says, God, I can't believe people remember me for that.

1903
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Well, yeah. Can you imagine being her? Like, you don't remember that shit. She was like a year and a half.

1904
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,000
That's really what she seems like. I don't remember any of this.

1905
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Yeah. And I guess the whole-

1906
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Oh, shit. I fell down a well. Gee.

1907
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Well, here's the-

1908
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I'm alive now. Yay.

1909
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Here's the part. Here's the thing, honey.

1910
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:44,000
She got like a million dollars worth of money. Like people just sent gifts, money, unsolicited, but people just sent like baby Jessica college money.

1911
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I think she's saying that's how she went to school.

1912
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah. And she all got put in a trust fund and like, I want to say I was reading online like next year or something.

1913
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
She's getting like a million dollars because it's all been saved and growing and all that stuff. So, you know, honey-

1914
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Here's a lesson to mothers. Stop watching your children around wells if you want them set for life.

1915
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Nice.

1916
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
This is what we teach here in America.

1917
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Nice.

1918
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Or you just need to have like eight kids all at once and everybody will give you tons of money for diapers and crap.

1919
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And wear fake Dolce & Gabbana glasses and drink your Starbucks every morning.

1920
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Yep.

1921
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:26,000
But this means that now Xbox Live is servicing 35 countries at once. It sure gets around.

1922
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
In a row?

1923
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
That's 37, dude.

1924
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
So we just need to give it two more.

1925
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
It can service Luxembourg.

1926
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Try not to service any more countries on your way to the parking lot.

1927
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:48,000
All right. If that's it for the rapid news tonight, let's get to the Twitter topics.

1928
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

1929
02:16:51,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Tweet.

1930
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,000
And I'm going to let her say tweet because we didn't get a whole lot tonight, but we'll do some that we got.

1931
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
This is our buddy Rob with two B's. He's on Twitter as Railgun Games.

1932
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:17,000
He says, what happened to the big box stores boycotting third party Wii games that are nothing but mini games?

1933
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
That's a good question.

1934
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Do you know anything about this, Loki?

1935
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Weren't stores supposed to be boycotting Wii games that were nothing but mini games?

1936
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I remember hearing about this too. It was on the show.

1937
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I think they do to a certain extent.

1938
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I mean, most stores nowadays realize that only the first party or big third party games are really the only things they're selling.

1939
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,000
So they're buying a lot less of the third party games that are just crap.

1940
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
As they should be doing with their dollars.

1941
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:53,000
But I don't think people are, well, I'm sure there's some stores that are outright forgetting to bring in certain games to their stores because they're absolute crap.

1942
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Or they're bringing in one copy.

1943
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:03,000
I could see that, but I don't think they're saying, we will not carry anymore of these Imagine games because they're crap.

1944
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
I mean, they're not going to outright say that.

1945
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Imagine babies.

1946
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Tweet, tweet.

1947
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Alright, moving on to other tweets.

1948
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Tigerclaw305 sends us some links, and I always let him get in a couple tweets here because there's good stuff.

1949
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I haven't heard this one either.

1950
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Apparently one of the EA developers is saying, and this is a pretty ballsy thing to say from a tweet, again, sent to us from Tigerclaw.

1951
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs.

1952
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
What?

1953
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
What?

1954
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:46,000
This is like, that's really interesting to hear because I was under the assumption that this is going to be as close to WoW as it gets, you know what I mean?

1955
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
And I'm not talking, again, I don't want to like...

1956
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,000
It'll be WoW without the suck.

1957
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I don't want to make, girl.

1958
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I don't want to make it sound like WoW and another big MMO are capable of coexisting.

1959
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I earned a girl.

1960
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
It doesn't have to be that you can, you know, this has to take away from WoW.

1961
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:08,000
But I always thought that this was really going to be the next big MMO, so it's kind of interesting that this whole thing is coming up here.

1962
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
DDR Dollar Bill says, I thought APB was the fail.

1963
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Well, it's coming from an EA Mythic employee who's going to be laid off next month, and they unloaded on the division for the Old Republic.

1964
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Apparently it has to do with why Warhammer crashed in Bird. Here's the thing.

1965
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,000
They've spent more money, this is according, again, to the person who was laid off or whatever.

1966
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:35,000
They spent more money making the Old Republic than James Cameron spent on Avatar, shit you not, 300 million dollars.

1967
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
And you know what they're most proud of? This is the kicker.

1968
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
They're most proud of the sound.

1969
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Something like a 20 gig installation and most of it is voiceover work.

1970
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
That's the best they have. The rest of the game is a joke.

1971
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
EA knows it and so does George Lucas.

1972
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:54,000
They're panicking and so much of Mythic has already been cannibalized to work in Austin on it because they can't keep pushing back launch.

1973
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs from EA, probably at the level of The Sims Online. We all know it too.

1974
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Now he could just be being bitter about the whole layoff thing, so take it with a grain of salt, but that's the first really really negative thing I've heard about it.

1975
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Aren't they doing top secret testing right now?

1976
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I heard somewhere that there is testing going on for the game right now, but it's under super duper NDA lock and key.

1977
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
So that's why you're not hearing a lot of stuff externally.

1978
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
You think some loudmouth is going to come out and dispute this.

1979
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I don't know.

1980
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Anyhow, one other quick story from Tigerfly.

1981
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
They're doing it under the name Final Fantasy XIV.

1982
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
He sent me a few, but I'm going to stick with two here.

1983
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Tweet, tweet!

1984
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Yes, he sent two tweets.

1985
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Apparently Mike Tyson's punch out has been reimagined on the iPhone.

1986
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I mean, ripped off.

1987
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Pretty much. Let's see, Rock Software created this game. You fight as a character named Lil Sammy, and then eventually you take on Mike Tyson.

1988
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I have no idea if they actually got a license or whatever, but you go through ten fights that lead up to Tyson.

1989
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
There it is, and there's a whole little picture there.

1990
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
It should be a better Evander Holyfield.

1991
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
You should play as Lil Mike.

1992
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I'm curious if they actually have the licensing, because that could be very bad for them if not.

1993
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,000
He probably needs the money, so he's like, you can do it for five dollars.

1994
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
That could be, or I'll bite your ear off.

1995
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
It's going to be 99 cents though.

1996
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Spazinator wants to give us a heads up.

1997
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
There's a free episode of Sengoku Basara Samurai Warriors anime on the PSN video store right now.

1998
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Could that have anything to do with the game that just came out?

1999
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Who knows?

2000
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
It's a mystery to everyone.

2001
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Alright, here's an old-time Q&A from SSG100Matt. Thank you, SSG100Matt.

2002
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Tweet, tweet!

2003
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:47,000
With the 400th episode coming up, have you thought about getting the DDR gang back together and doing an episode at RVGL?

2004
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Last time we did an episode at RVGL we almost got kicked out.

2005
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
However, here's an idea I do like.

2006
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Think about this, folks.

2007
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
For our 400th episode, I bet we could find a local pizza joint to loan us their buffet room.

2008
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
And Logie, the tech master, I'm sure has a way for us to broadcast over his little Wi-Fi thingamabobber so we can do it.

2009
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Well, we can figure it out.

2010
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Or I'm sure the restaurant might let us use it if we bring in enough business.

2011
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
You know, we could go to one of these pizza joints, like a round table or a straw hat or something,

2012
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,000
and get a bunch of people from the old DDR days there.

2013
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Like, obviously, Iguana Girl would be invited, but get some of our Bay Area friends.

2014
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Maybe we would even do it in the Bay.

2015
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Mountain Mike's.

2016
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Step Squad and RTF.

2017
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
That's a good idea. The old school Mountain Mike's in Concord.

2018
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
And that would be a nice middle place because it would only be about an hour and ten minutes away from here.

2019
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Excellent idea.

2020
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
And they do have good pizza.

2021
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
And decent beer.

2022
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Are they still there? Do they still have DDR?

2023
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
As far as I know.

2024
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,000
We would love to do that for the 400th episode and try to get all the old school people we can.

2025
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
It might be tricky on a Sunday night, but we're 14 weeks away.

2026
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
It's going to be in mid-January, I think, is when we hit 400.

2027
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
We've got time to plan it.

2028
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
That's just my fantasy dream thing.

2029
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Another thing to consider is that maybe I could sweet talk a particular friend of mine

2030
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,000
who is married to another friend of mine who has a DDR solo machine in their garage.

2031
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I knew who you were talking about.

2032
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Nudge! Nudge!

2033
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I'll have to talk to them separately.

2034
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Theirs is wired with a Playstation in theirs.

2035
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Yeah, but it's still cool.

2036
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I have the guts for a DDR machine, just no pads.

2037
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
They have a solo in no game.

2038
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,000
So that's what I do.

2039
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
You take your thing and put it in their thing.

2040
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
And then you make a brand new thing.

2041
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:58,000
It's technically a Dance Maniacs J-Append right now, but it could easily be converted into a DDR machine.

2042
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Sorry, I'm...

2043
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,000
And actually, we could run 1.5 on that machine without any modifications,

2044
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:11,000
because 1.5 and EuroMix, I think, in one don't require the flash drive.

2045
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I have to post this in our chatroom, I'm sorry, this is totally unrelated,

2046
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
but Alan likes to send me funny shit during the show just to get me to crack up on air,

2047
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
and he sent me this picture from Trader Joe's of an advertisement for Gunby Bears,

2048
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:27,000
but look very carefully at the little Bryce tag.

2049
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Link! Link! Link!

2050
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I'll post that in chat right now, that's great.

2051
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
So that she who is near-sighted can see it.

2052
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I love how they...

2053
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
That is fantastic!

2054
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I love Trader Joe's, I really do, it's the best grocery store.

2055
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I'm saving this.

2056
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Anyhow, also, lots of change on Twitter.

2057
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I have not recognized that name as a tweeter in the past, so happy tweeting to you.

2058
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
What's your favorite game with Batman?

2059
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Well, that kind of narrows it down.

2060
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
It was that one game with Batman.

2061
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I would have to go with Arkham Asylum.

2062
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Fuck you, I like Superman 64!

2063
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Ewww!

2064
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Is Batman even in that?

2065
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Hopefully DC Universe...

2066
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
It's a joke, Loki, it's what we call a joke here on the show.

2067
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Well, no, I thought it is a game that is in the DC Universe,

2068
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I thought that maybe Batman had a cameo in it.

2069
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I'm Batman, and I declare that this game...

2070
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Sucks!

2071
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
To be honest, if it's not going to be DC Universe online, which I'm really hoping,

2072
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:41,000
the old school one on the NES, the very first one by Sunsoft to the Batman game on the NES was pretty badass.

2073
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
There was also one on the Commodore 64 that was told in a comic book style, also kind of badass.

2074
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Bart's nightmare, but I guess that was Bartman, not Batman.

2075
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I'll take it.

2076
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Lots of change, we'll take it, and he'll like it.

2077
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Tweet, tweet!

2078
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Twitter segment tonight.

2079
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
That's all the tweets.

2080
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Awww.

2081
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Tweet!

2082
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Or I guess we can say Shinobi 2.

2083
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
That's true, because Spiderman was also in that one.

2084
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
It's not really Batman.

2085
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,000
There were enemies in the game that looked very much like particular other franchises from different comic book companies.

2086
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Stop being so fucking obscure.

2087
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I covered it on the classic game, Ron.

2088
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I'm sorry!

2089
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Stop sounding like a Japanese girl having sex.

2090
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
That would be...

2091
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,000
And know that the listeners are deaf.

2092
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Wow, you do that impression way too well, I'm just saying.

2093
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I will tell you how I do it way too well.

2094
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Thank god your mic cut out, that's all I'm saying.

2095
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I will tell you how I know how to do that.

2096
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:56,000
That comes from my dorm room, with a group of us deciding to dub Urotsuki Doji by ourselves.

2097
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Wow.

2098
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And every other line was, no, don't touch me there!

2099
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:12,000
All I have to say is if we do get the cool 400th episode of The Pizza Place or wherever we have it where we get all the old school DDR people back, we need to bring in a copy of Final Fuck X.

2100
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
You know what, Rob, I found that recently.

2101
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Or Dance Dance Fuck.

2102
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
I don't remember where that is.

2103
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
If we did do that at Mountain Mics, they have a little side room too, so you could set up a TV in the side room.

2104
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
And everybody stand to block the kids view.

2105
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Exactly!

2106
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
You have to put, like, what, a red door?

2107
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But I want to paint it black.

2108
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Alright.

2109
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Hey, since Iguana Girl is here with us, sorry, Iguana Girl is here with us, let's do a special...

2110
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Girl, not girl!

2111
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Girl!

2112
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Alright, let's...

2113
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Here...

2114
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Let's do...

2115
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Let's do a game show, yay, an OLR game show, we love game shows at OLR.

2116
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Game show!

2117
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:13,000
This is one of the longest running game shows, in fact, it's kind of funny, I was hanging out with my friend Julie this week, I've known her for years, she's my ex-girlfriend, I've known her for years.

2118
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I remember just after that.

2119
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Julie...

2120
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
I remember when you were straight.

2121
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Used to be, well, you know.

2122
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
I'm one of the only people that could see that, too.

2123
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
You were around during my bi phase, actually.

2124
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yes!

2125
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Alright, anyhow, all that stuff aside, quickly, Julie actually used to help me host the radio show I did in college.

2126
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And this is a segment we started then, and it's carried over all the way until now.

2127
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
It's a segment we call Listless!

2128
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:49,000
And tonight's listless topic is the thing I learned most from DDRFreak.

2129
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Alright, the thing I learned most from DDRFreak.

2130
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:58,000
And the way Listless works is we're going to go around the room and we're going to get everybody's top three answers.

2131
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,000
But then we go around and each strike one item that is not worthy of the list.

2132
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
And then you guys in our chatroom vote.

2133
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
And the top three is the definitive winner.

2134
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:14,000
And there is no contesting the list once it is set in stone.

2135
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,000
This is a very, it's a highly scientific process.

2136
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
It's made with uranium and shit, okay?

2137
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
That's how scientific this is.

2138
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Uranium and shit.

2139
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And Uranus.

2140
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Wouldn't uranium and shit just make a big, huge, busy puddle?

2141
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
It'd make a very sticky, smelly, but hard.

2142
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Nuclear poo.

2143
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Nuclear poo.

2144
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Great, my boyfriend's asking in chat, what the fuck was Rob's bi-phase, an episode of Melrose Place?

2145
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Funny enough, a place I used to live was referred to as Melrose Place now, and I know where that was.

2146
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
I know where that was!

2147
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I know someone who had a bi-phase then.

2148
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Alright, anyhow.

2149
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Let's move on and talk about other topics, please, quickly.

2150
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Your prom's all red again, that's weird.

2151
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Oh no, I just love bringing up old drama, it's like ten years old.

2152
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Alright.

2153
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Which is humorous because I'm actually like friends with one of the old parties again.

2154
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Oh really?

2155
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Oh, good times, how's that going?

2156
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:20,000
It's fine.

2157
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Yeah, it's good.

2158
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
It's good, it's good. Alright, anyhow.

2159
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Let's move on, the list list, and talk about the top three things I learned most on DDR4E.

2160
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Dark soccer, start us off tonight.

2161
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I have to start? Okay.

2162
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Yeah, why not?

2163
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I learned how to detect werewolves.

2164
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Good one.

2165
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I never played but I don't know a lot.

2166
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Yeah, I was touted as one of the better werewolf game players.

2167
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
You guys stole one of my answers too, there's the epic thread in random chat, right?

2168
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
The werewolf game?

2169
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Yeah.

2170
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Good times.

2171
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Alright, Jessica Harper, why don't you go next, what's your number three answer?

2172
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I learned that trolls are more popular and more respected than mods.

2173
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Trolls are more popular than mods, is there any reason why you say that?

2174
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Because they end up with like a...
