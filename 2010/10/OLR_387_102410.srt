00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,240
Tonight, October 24th, 2010, two Capcom worlds collide in an upcoming 3DS game, fans of Sonic

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
the Hedgehog up the ante in the new HD version, and in one country, Grand Theft Auto IV is

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,720
ordered off the shelves.

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,120
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Radio.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,080
We are that radio video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,120
We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,460
www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,640
Joining you over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-hosts.

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Storms lol.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
I know right.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,360
Yeah, we're having storms right now.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,960
We're having rain and nobody in California knows how to deal with it.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, we had to do a disclaimer for live listeners because one of the people that doesn't know

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,440
how to handle storms is Comcast, the internet provider out here in Sacramento.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Exactly.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,000
And so the internet has cut out at your house, what, five times today at least?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
I know at home it's been cutting in and out.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,440
Three times since I've been awake.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,480
I just got a text from Alan saying it cut out again while he was trying to listen to

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,760
our call with Bobby before the show tonight.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Which is funny because in Alabama I remember being on dial-up in a hurricane.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,920
I just don't know how to handle it out here.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
They really don't.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
And what makes it worse too is that, not to get too off kilter here, but what makes it

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,040
worse is that when you have this first major rain of the season as it finally is, here

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
we are the end of October, the problem is everything is so dried out from a long summer

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
that it just screws everything up.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,240
And the oil floats all up to the top of the streets and it becomes a big slick and no

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,440
one knows how to drive in the rain.

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,440
But it's been raining for almost, it feels like a day straight.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
It rained yesterday almost all day.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Crazy.

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
I've enjoyed it.

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I like the rain.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
But I've been sick.

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,640
So I like rain when I'm sick because then it makes all the warm food I'm eating so much

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
better.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,400
And then just everybody else is having to be miserable because you're miserable, right?

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,000
No, I'm good because I spend most of the time asleep.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Really?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because that's how I am.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
I'm like, if I'm sick then I want everyone to be sick.

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,320
When Dan gets sick he's a big baby.

46
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,480
He just curls up on the couch and makes pathetic faces at me.

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,240
Is that what your cat does too?

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,760
She's sitting on your feet right now kind of.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
She's purring.

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
All right.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,080
Say hello of course to tech master Loki also joining us tonight as he always does.

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Hello.

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
And complete with what?

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,720
Are we on quadruple bacon pizza now?

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Not yet.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,320
I didn't want to scare them with the thought of putting in four times the amount of bacon

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
on a pizza.

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
They'd have to make you sign a medical disclaimer.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,840
I'd eat them into that, you know.

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,840
All right.

61
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
How have things been for you?

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
How's the baby doing?

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Baby is fine.

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,760
He's, he was with mom going to her parents' house.

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,960
Now where's that?

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Is that in the bay?

67
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Folsom.

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
That's not that bad.

70
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Is he pooping fine?

71
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Yeah, he's pooping just fine.

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Okay.

73
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Because I remember the poop scare.

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Inquiring minds.

75
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Want to know.

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
All right.

77
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Joining us in studio tonight, yes, in studio, not on Skype.

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,420
We love having guests actually come down to the studio and hang with us.

79
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,000
Say hello to our pal, the Seg.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hello, O-L-R.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hello, Seg.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,520
Wonderful to be here.

83
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Wonderful to have you.

84
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,120
Thank you so much for coming out here.

85
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,980
I haven't really had a chance to say it to you before we've gone live because it's just

86
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,980
been go, go, go, go.

87
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,640
Cause I was running in the door late tonight, but, um, but I did get a new mic cord for

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,280
Dark Sakura, so it wasn't all for naught.

89
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
So just saying, hopefully it works tonight.

90
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm not having to hold it in.

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
That's what she said.

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
All right.

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,160
So anyway, but, uh, say you, you drove all the way here from the Bay area, which is a

94
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,080
good, well, usually it's probably about an hour and a half, but I'm going to guess because

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,000
of the rain, it probably took like an hour and a half, you know, I am from Detroit, so

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,320
I actually know how to drive, you know, Ford family here, so, well, regardless, no matter

97
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,800
how long it took you to get here, it is quite a bit of a tank of gas.

98
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,880
So I do really appreciate you coming out and hanging here in studio with us.

99
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,280
Not quite as glamorous as the sounds on the radio, huh?

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,760
Well, you know, you don't have to, to, to pull back the curtain for everyone out there

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
on the internet.

102
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Yeah, that's all right.

103
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
All right.

104
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Yeah.

105
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
I meant, uh, of course our microphones are all gold-plated.

106
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,240
This couch is absolutely wonderful.

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Maho, maho.

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Give me, give me more grapes, servants.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All right.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,440
Uh, well, Saig, you are here though.

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
Of course you have ulterior motives for being here tonight.

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Not that we mind.

113
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,480
We appreciate a reason to have you here in house, but you're here to promote a little

114
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,120
something something that's going on, right?

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Yeah.

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Just, just a little something.

117
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,640
You might've heard of it because, you know, we, I, gosh, we've only mentioned it on the

118
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,840
show about 50 gazillion times.

119
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
That's okay.

120
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,420
Cause it's, it's a charity thing and we'll say it a gazillion more times for charity.

121
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
What is, what is up?

122
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,360
What's, what's the, what's the big event that you are co-hosting?

123
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,700
Oom loud, a rock band night for child's play charity.

124
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,640
It's a performance based rock band night.

125
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,280
And I really stress it as performance.

126
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,140
It's not a competition.

127
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,080
We don't give a care about your score whatsoever.

128
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,320
It's all about rocking out for child's play charity.

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Yeah.

130
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,800
No one, no one, as the old saying on the internet goes, no one Kerr, if you have a crappy score

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,320
on a song or what have you, you're going to get the most props if you have like, if you're

132
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,840
really into it, like the outfits and stuff.

133
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,200
Some of the stuff I saw last year, outstanding, the Lego rock band people were great.

134
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,160
There was a lots of dress ups, bands, good times.

135
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Yeah.

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, we started it last year under the wake of Fundrauser, which went away, but it was

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,680
Chris Koehler of wired.com game life blog Joe Marquette of Game Helper and myself.

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,920
And we put on San Francisco's child's play charity event community fundraiser for child's

139
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,520
play.

140
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,800
And last year we did it all soup to nuts within eight weeks.

141
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,120
And that's also incorporated as our own nonprofit to be all nice and legal.

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,960
And I guess I should talk about the band packages because that's really where we're leading

143
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
into.

144
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Sure.

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Why not?

146
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
We're all over the map, but that's okay.

147
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
We're everywhere.

148
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
That's why it's a three hour show.

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,200
We can never stay on one track.

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
So it's fine.

151
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Take all the time you need.

152
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,880
So it's not, we don't do the just go up and play at a bar.

153
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,920
Like if you go to a bar or anything to play rock band, it's usually one screen and everyone

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,560
is looking at the screen.

155
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,360
What we do is have the performers turn around and face the audience and perform out to the

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
audience.

157
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,040
And there's monitors on the stage floor, but they look like speaker monitors to the audience

158
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,620
because it's next to the speaker monitors.

159
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,840
And we don't just let anyone just walk up and play.

160
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:14,280
We pre-order band packages where a group of friends make a donation to UMLoud on our website

161
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,240
to purchase a band package.

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,560
And then they have one song that they pick that no one else will play on their main stage.

163
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,600
So like if I claim a song and I say like Gaga is mine tonight, it's me.

164
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I am Gaga.

165
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,080
Then nobody else can pick that same Gaga song.

166
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
First come first serve.

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,680
But yes, once it's locked in, it's yours.

168
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
No one else will play on the main stage.

169
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Because that really sucks at like karaoke sometimes and you got like four people in

170
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,240
a row, you know, because we belong together now.

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
It's like, oh God, shut up.

172
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
And also-

173
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
They all get progressively worse.

174
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,660
Well, it's also, you know, there are 2000 songs in rock band.

175
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,120
It's going to be hard to duplicate.

176
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,600
Is that even counting the network stuff?

177
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,640
I think their 2000 count counts the network stuff.

178
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Okay.

179
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,880
But still, that's a lot.

180
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,360
But the thing is, is that we don't know what's going to happen with these bands when they

181
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
show, especially last year.

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,920
We didn't know if people were going to get it.

183
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,160
I mean, we didn't know if people were just going to like, oh, I'm playing rock band or

184
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,680
like, no, this is my rock concert.

185
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,960
And there were people that got it.

186
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:31,760
The one band that to me really got it was Ironhead, as in the Brutal Legend game.

187
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Yes, I remember that.

188
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,400
And pictures of that girl all over the internet.

189
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I should plug the website.

190
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:45,000
If you go to umloud.org, now that's U-M-L-O-U-D, umloud.org, and you'll see the little flicker

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
button there too, and that will give you all the pictures.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,880
And you'll see Ophelia there.

193
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,520
She's pretty hard to miss because she spent a couple of hours before that day being dressed

194
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,960
up in blue makeup, head to toe.

195
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,080
And I didn't know that they, I mean, I knew they were named Ironhead, knew they were doing

196
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,600
... I'm totally blanking on the song name.

197
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,240
Whatever song they did, yeah.

198
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,920
Helion Electric Eye.

199
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,160
And when they hit the stage, I saw her there dressed up and like, oh, that's one of my

200
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
friends.

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,680
And then when they performed, it was absolutely amazing.

202
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,120
They got it.

203
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,720
And this year we hope to have more that get it.

204
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,140
The ante is being upped now that people are seeing the pictures from last year.

205
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,320
It's like, how can we just even take it a step further?

206
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
You know, there's going to be people that are like, we can outdo.

207
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,320
And we want to facilitate that at UMLoud, which is why we're doing something additional

208
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
to the event.

209
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
Now, the ultimate band package, that's the band package that we did last year, and then

210
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,320
we're still doing, those go on sale November 1st.

211
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,760
But we decided we wanted to do one really special package that we're calling the Headliner

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,080
Band.

213
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,560
And this package is, there's only one of them, because it's the headliner.

214
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,400
So it's auctioned off, and it's actually going on right now through eBay.

215
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,320
And they get a two song set.

216
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,840
And as long as they don't dilly dally, they get first choice for the night to reserve

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,980
those two songs.

218
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,120
And they're the headliners.

219
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,920
So obviously they're on the flyers, they're on the posters, they're on the video that

220
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
we make.

221
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,520
We actually have Area 5, which is a video production company that will be making the

222
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,600
commercials and, assuming schedules gel well, will be doing the video for us with the Headliner

223
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
Band.

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,640
And you get your own place at DNA Lounge, which is the venue that we're in, with drink

225
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,680
and food service all provided to you.

226
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,360
So you can have people feed you grapes?

227
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes.

228
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
All right, awesome.

229
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm liking this so far.

230
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,520
And that's going on now, and that auction actually ends Thursday at 4pm-ish.

231
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:23,140
And we really hope we get a lot of people bidding on that thing, because the donation

232
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,800
all goes to Child's Play.

233
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
I was going to stress, this money is not going to SEG.

234
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
No.

235
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,420
This money is not going to DNA Lounge.

236
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,640
This money is going to charity.

237
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
All of it, right?

238
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Yes.

239
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,000
It's going to Child's Play charity, which provides video games, toys, and other financial

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,320
support to children's hospitals around the globe.

241
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,400
And it's kind of known as the Penny Arcade charity, but even Penny Arcade wants to stress

242
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,920
that it's not like, oh, this is directly all Penny Arcade.

243
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:01,240
They want to stress that this is, yes, they house the offices and the staff for it, but...

244
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,920
They planted the seed, but it's grown into its own thing.

245
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,280
And especially with all of the community fundraisers that happen, like Goomlap, but also Desert

246
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Bus for Hope, and the Mario Marathon, and all the others.

247
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,480
These are people, Child's Play itself just is the direct servicer.

248
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:27,160
They take the money and directly deal with the child's life services, or equivalent of

249
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,120
the children's hospitals and their network.

250
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,160
And they get the toys there.

251
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,920
They make what toys are needed and all that.

252
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,000
So what's given is exactly what the hospital needs.

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,940
And what the community fundraisers do is help in very creative, unique ways to raise money

254
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
for this charity.

255
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,120
And it's actually the envy of nonprofits because every year for Child's Play has beaten its

256
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,920
high score the previous year, including the past two years when that shouldn't have happened,

257
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,720
economic downturn.

258
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:12,560
And Child's Play was one of the very, very few charities that increased their giving.

259
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,040
And that's everything to do with these community fundraisers across the globe.

260
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,400
Do you guys have a fundraising goal set for Goomlap this year?

261
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
Is that one of those, you know, I don't want to talk about it type of things?

262
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,940
Well, it kind of is.

263
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,720
We always want to do more.

264
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:39,680
And we just focus that energy on making the best event without making much cost on how

265
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
to put on the event.

266
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Okay.

267
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,060
And we have a lot of partners that help us.

268
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Let me ask this.

269
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,400
Can I ask how much we raised last year?

270
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,440
Last year, I wrote the checkout and mailed it in for $7,000 to Child's Play.

271
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Nice.

272
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Very nice.

273
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,800
And, you know, that was eight weeks of putting everything together.

274
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,440
It was kind of last moment.

275
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,760
So this year, we hope to improve on the situation.

276
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
And also a lot...

277
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Umlaut is...

278
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,080
Just for the record, I would have never known that it only took eight weeks to do if you

279
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
hadn't told me.

280
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Yeah.

281
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
You guys did a really good job last year.

282
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I know.

283
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,680
I don't even know how we did it.

284
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,520
And I'm not just saying that because you're a friend.

285
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,960
You really was a smooth operation.

286
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,200
But, you know, we also have good partners.

287
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,840
DNA Lounge, Jamie Zawinski, the owner, and Barry, and all of them over there are just

288
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,360
absolutely wonderful to us.

289
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,500
You know, we definitely make sure they're in the loop.

290
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,920
We definitely respect them as the venue.

291
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
And they...

292
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Harmonics isn't on this too, right?

293
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Oh, yeah.

294
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Yeah.

295
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
And harmonics.

296
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Oh, I should say.

297
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,840
We will have every song playable in Rock Band 3 as in...

298
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,480
Harmonics has a magic box that has them all, right?

299
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Yeah.

300
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,120
They have the magic boxes of dev kits that they will...

301
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
And they fly people out.

302
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,260
John Drake and crew will fly out for our event with the dev kits.

303
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,400
And we actually have two stages.

304
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,460
So I know I've been stressing the main stage and the performances there, which is the show

305
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
in itself.

306
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,040
But there's a lot of other things that we have there.

307
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,840
We have in the lounge room, the second room, free play Rock Band, show up.

308
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,320
We have the donation bin out there to kind of guilt you, but it's free play.

309
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,800
We don't care to walk up.

310
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,240
You know, that's your traditional sort of like bar Rock Band setting.

311
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
And that's free play.

312
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,880
Last year was like the Beatles room because that was the big game last year.

313
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,640
And this year is just kind of whatever is clever.

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Well, we don't know what we're gonna have special yet for...

315
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,560
We don't know what we have special yet for this year.

316
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,600
But last year we debuted before it came out, the Rubber Soul album from Beatles Rock Band,

317
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
which was...

318
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,320
Which is the best and is sitting in my closet right there.

319
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
It's somewhere in there.

320
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,640
Well, am I gonna get Jamie to go with me this year?

321
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,020
Maybe she can belt out a tune or two.

322
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
Maybe.

323
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
On the Beast, I will make you go on the main stage.

324
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Actually, let me ask this.

325
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,860
I'm sorry to take this wheel in another direction, but this question has been kind of like lingering

326
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,160
on my mind.

327
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,200
Maybe I'm not a person that wants to get up in front of the crowd.

328
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You know what?

329
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
I don't...

330
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,900
I want to help the charity, but I don't...

331
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
I don't...

332
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,500
Singing in front of people is not my thing.

333
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,520
What fun things can I expect to have at UMLoud?

334
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,800
Well, first of all, it's the performances.

335
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,760
As I said, they are performances.

336
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,520
And if you search YouTube for UMLoud, you'll see what I mean.

337
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:36,920
I mean, yes, the cell phone cameras, but you'll see the kind of performances.

338
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:46,880
And that alone is worth the $10 door, but we don't stop there.

339
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:54,120
We will have what's been called the nerd yard sale.

340
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,440
And we get...

341
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,380
We clean out the closets of various game studios and developers and publishers and news outlets

342
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,760
and all that to clean out all the swag they've collected for the year and just put it on

343
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
the table.

344
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,120
And if you pay for the door, you pick one thing from the table.

345
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,480
So you at least walk out with something.

346
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,440
But in addition, we're going to have a raffle and some pretty good prizes, if I do say so

347
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,120
myself.

348
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,240
We'll be announcing those.

349
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,360
A lot of...

350
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,640
Right now, our attention is all on the bands because we're trying to get this auction that

351
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,080
finished on... it ends Thursday, and then the following Monday is when we get the ultimate

352
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
band.

353
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,560
So we're kind of geared towards that, and then we make the push of, please show up.

354
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,240
Well, I wanted you to get that out there, that there was that going on, because we do...

355
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,520
Believe it or not, there are a few friends of our show that work at various developers

356
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,040
and things, and even though I know they don't email us or talk to us all the time because

357
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,680
they don't want to talk about their projects, if you happen to work for a developer or some

358
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,560
type of game studio and you have some extra stuff sitting in a storage room that maybe

359
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,880
some fans might want, Umlaut would be a great charity to kind of give those to, right?

360
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Yes.

361
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,440
We actually are looking for sponsors, both financial as well as gifts and all that.

362
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:29,200
We are our own non-profit, so we are our own 501c3 in case people are a little weary of

363
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
not giving directly to Child's Play.

364
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:38,280
First of all, yes, it's going to Child's Play, and donating to us directly is also legal

365
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,000
in the state of California and the United States as a non-profit.

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So please, if you want to give us stuff or be a financial partner with us, please, please,

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,840
please go to umlaut.org.

368
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,640
There's that sponsor link there, and we would love to talk to you.

369
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,400
I could probably look through the vault and find you swag.

370
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
That'd be awesome.

371
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,600
I've got like a dozen left of those Metal Gear Solid behind the scenes things.

372
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,440
So if they're just collecting dust here, absolutely, it'd be great charity for OLR to pitch in

373
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
and help out.

374
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
So, excellent.

375
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,640
Maybe I have a few more Capcom pillowcases.

376
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,120
Well, I'm trying to think what else to kind of get out here before we move on with the

377
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
show.

378
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
I'll ask you more maybe later on in the show, part B, kind of about what goes into the actual

379
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,840
planning of the event, but as far as the event itself, anything else we need to know about

380
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
what's coming up December 9th?

381
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,440
It's Thursday, December 9th.

382
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,920
I stress the Thursday because last year was on Wednesday.

383
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:44,560
We leveled up to Thursday, and if we get more people, we may be able to level up for weekend.

384
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,440
So it's really important for people to show up.

385
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,000
So if you're anywhere remotely near the Bay Area, please come on down.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,720
And tickets, if tickets are on sale right now, you can click on tickets on the website

387
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,040
if you know you're not going to be in a band, but do want to show up, that's really helpful

388
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
for us.

389
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,800
I should also note that if you are in a band package, you're on the guest list, you get

390
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,120
in, you're good.

391
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,280
But if you have any inkling of showing up, please show up.

392
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,240
You will not regret it.

393
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,080
And for those of our listeners, because we are, believe it or not, an international show,

394
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,480
we have folks that listen to the show in Mexico, in Sweden, and all these places, as much as

395
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,680
we really want them to come, they're probably not going to be able to swing it, but there

396
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,600
are ways they can still participate if they're very far away, right?

397
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Yes.

398
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,720
We have the donation button right on every single page at nlal.org.

399
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,600
Which is if you, Child's Play uses PayPal for direct donations.

400
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,720
We use Google Checkout, and we don't want, I want to stress that we're not trying to

401
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,160
like take money, or to have this like bidding war between who donates to Child's Play and

402
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,320
who donates to UMLoud because it's going the same place anyways, but you know, if you feel

403
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,000
more comfortable with Google Checkout, the donation button's there for you.

404
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,120
If you want to go straight to Child's Play, awesome, it's childsplaycharity.org, and that

405
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,240
just goes such a long way.

406
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,360
Absolutely.

407
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,120
And I have a good feeling you're going to beat that $7,000 this year, I have a really

408
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
good feeling.

409
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I sure bloody hope so.

410
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
All right.

411
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,880
Well, best of luck, Seg, and of course you're going to be sitting in on the show tonight,

412
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,600
so feel free to chime in on anything gaming related and so forth.

413
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh, I'll have opinions.

414
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,480
Oh, I bet you will, especially, there might be stories about a particular developer that

415
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
might be of...

416
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Oh yeah, that.

417
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,360
Yes, of interest to you, but we'll see.

418
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,400
All right, moving on, we are in, yes, start talking.

419
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm telling the chat room that if I can get $150 in donations tonight, I'll sing.

420
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Oh, really?

421
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,560
The proverbial gauntlet has been thrown down.

422
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,680
If you guys can scrounge up $150 in donations to UMLoud, then Dark Soccer, you are saying

423
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,760
you will get up on that stage and you will sing?

424
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Yes.

425
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,560
I can't put into words what a big freaking deal that is.

426
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,960
I just want to put out there.

427
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
Because everybody but me thinks I can sing.

428
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,920
Dark Soccer is actually a pretty good singer.

429
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,280
Can we extend that maybe through the next week for our podcastees who maybe aren't listening

430
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
live tonight?

431
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,720
If we get $150 tonight, I'll sing.

432
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Oh, okay, you're throwing down.

433
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,720
If we don't get $150 tonight, if we get $250 by next weekend...

434
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,800
She's throwing all these random numbers out there.

435
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,080
No, seriously, because there's a method of my madness.

436
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,960
If we don't hit $150 tonight, and they have a way of saying donate in the name of...

437
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,640
But if they go through the UMLoud donation button, I have obviously no access to the

438
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Child's Play 1.

439
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah.

440
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
But...

441
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Yeah.

442
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:03,680
There should be some sort of note, I think.

443
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,600
We'll figure out the logistics.

444
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,400
If you do donate...

445
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,200
If there isn't some place to put it in, obviously, can people email...

446
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,560
Let's have them email the receipt number.

447
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,160
Email your receipt to Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

448
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Perfect.

449
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
That works.

450
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,280
But if you can't put it on there, make sure you say, For Orange Lounge Radio.

451
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
All right.

452
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Or something about...

453
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:37,920
And if you happen to buy a million copies of Eye of Judgment tonight, how about if we

454
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
can...

455
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,040
How much money can we raise to get Loki to go to the show in a tingle outfit?

456
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
No.

457
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,240
How about if we can raise $1,000 by the night of the...

458
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
No, I am not going.

459
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
We gotta watch it.

460
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,880
Okay, if we can raise $1,000, but then I'll dress as freaking tingle shit.

461
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,400
Uh-oh.

462
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
She said it.

463
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
She said it.

464
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
All right.

465
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Okay, okay.

466
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:08,600
If we can raise $1,000 by the night of UMLoud, I will go as a Para Para girl.

467
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
Blonde wig and all.

468
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
All right.

469
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Well, regardless of how much...

470
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I'll wear some costume.

471
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
Regardless of how much is raised tonight or until the night, you're at least gonna go

472
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
to the show, I hope.

473
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Yeah.

474
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Absolutely.

475
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
All right, good.

476
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Yay.

477
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Oh, she went to school that night.

478
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Cut class.

479
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
All right.

480
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
I think about it.

481
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
All right.

482
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Tell the teacher it's for charity.

483
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
All right.

484
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Anyhow.

485
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Let's move on.

486
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Talk about our gaming weeks.

487
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,480
We're gonna talk a little bit about what types of video games we have been playing this week.

488
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,240
Usually it's how we start off the show, but you know what?

489
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,720
We have charity things to talk about tonight.

490
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,520
So we're gonna start now with how was your gaming week?

491
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,960
Dark Soccer, what kind of video games you've been playing this week?

492
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,480
Well, I just played something that I'm gonna be talking about later on in the show, so

493
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
I won't talk about it right now.

494
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,720
What else did I play?

495
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,680
Bayonetta, because she is a sexy bitch.

496
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,840
And what else did I play?

497
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,680
I played some Final Fantasy 13.

498
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,760
I tried to play some Star Trek Online, but I'm pissed off at the Borg right now.

499
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,160
Very, very pissed.

500
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,560
Okay, if somebody knows how to pass a stupid Borg mission, let me know, because I am pissed

501
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
off at it.

502
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,720
It just says, Defeat Borg, steal data.

503
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Can I tell a quick side story?

504
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,920
There's 50 of them in there.

505
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
It's a viniculum.

506
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
What?

507
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,040
Can I tell a quick side story that made me think of you today?

508
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,520
I was playing WoW this morning, and I was in a party for the holiday event with a Boomkin

509
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,160
whose name was Tom Paris.

510
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
And we did a very...

511
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,040
The tank disconnected because of this bug going on in WoW right now.

512
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,720
So the Moonkin had to tank the boss, which is kind of funny if you know how WoW works.

513
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,440
So I said at the end of the fight, I said, Janeway would be very proud of you, Tom Paris.

514
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,680
And he said, Oh, that's my rogue.

515
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,140
Ah, that's great.

516
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,380
So it made me think of you, because it's all Star Trek nerds.

517
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,380
That's great.

518
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
Why isn't he playing Star Trek Online?

519
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
He probably is.

520
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,520
He must be on a Mac.

521
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,560
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

522
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,080
I have several friends who actually can't play Star Trek Online anymore because they

523
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,760
don't have it for Mac.

524
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Hurry up!

525
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Get it out!

526
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Um, oh yeah.

527
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,240
And I also played a lot of Plants vs. Zombies, and because I'm addicted, addicted, addicted

528
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:26,000
to jackpot mode in Plants vs. Zombies and zombie bowling.

529
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,160
And um, I played a bunch of other stuff too.

530
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh, I've given up on Arbacular Drop.

531
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,060
I'm done with it.

532
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Given up.

533
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,960
Oh, and I played some Portal.

534
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,520
You just decided to move on to Portal.

535
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Yeah.

536
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,640
Well, I mean, Portal is more polished, you know?

537
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,080
And Arbacular Drop is a great concept.

538
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,920
And Portal is just the better execution.

539
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,480
Alright.

540
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,140
I smell baked goods.

541
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,240
Anything else for your gaming week, Dar Sakura?

542
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Meh.

543
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,200
Alright, let's move on to Loki.

544
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,340
How was your gaming week, Loki?

545
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,160
I didn't play a whole lot of stuff.

546
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:06,120
I played, um, I think some Plants vs. Zombies.

547
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,080
I haven't really been playing that much this week.

548
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,920
No, the only iOS game I think I've really been playing a lot of recently is-

549
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Do I have a unicorn attack?

550
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,680
Uh, no, actually not that.

551
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,640
I did play some last week though on the show of that.

552
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,040
No, I've been actually addicted to Cartoon Wars 2.

553
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
It's a tower defense game.

554
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,920
And with stick figures, except they have, like, heavy artillery and stuff.

555
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
It's pretty awesome.

556
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,640
They have everything from, like, you know, medieval weapons, swords, spears, bow and

557
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,760
arrows and stuff to giant mechs and bazookas and all that fun stuff.

558
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,240
So it's pretty fun.

559
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm just grinding along right now.

560
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,400
And then, um, you know, I played a little bit of DJ Hero 2.

561
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,060
And I'm totally digging the new songs in there.

562
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,120
Although they're still just, like, the first game, but I mean, I guess it's gonna be with

563
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
every game that comes out.

564
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,400
There's a bunch of songs that I don't really care for.

565
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,560
Like, I really wish they would stop putting all these, like, old school, um, like, seriously,

566
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,760
we do not need any more Jackson 5 music in the goddamn DJ Hero series.

567
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,320
No more Jackson 5 at all.

568
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:19,000
And some of, like, the old 90s rap stuff that's in there, um, is alright, but I don't know.

569
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,440
I just think they need more variety in some of the songs, because I can only hear so many

570
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,800
remixes of California, you know, before I just get sick of it.

571
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Um, or OPP.

572
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:39,220
Yeah, it's too bad you can't get, uh, your, like, the booty mashups or that kind of level

573
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,960
because, you know, they have to, like, actually get the licensing for the music.

574
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
More gorillas!

575
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
More gorillas!

576
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,320
Yeah, they have the Stylo, um, mix with itself, yeah.

577
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,080
I need, I need to hear that one.

578
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I love Stylo.

579
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
I love the whole album.

580
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,880
It is a lot harder than the first game, which is something that's, uh, worth noting.

581
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,440
Like, I, I mainly just play in medium, but just because I haven't played enough DJ Hero

582
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,760
of the War, I was, I think at one point, starting to go on hard and stuff, um, to get to expert

583
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,840
and all that fun stuff, but I like kinda just playing it more relaxed instead of just trying

584
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,520
to mash buttons like crazy in it, and even on medium, it's mashing buttons like crazy

585
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:26,200
with a lot of the songs, like the Firestarter remix with itself, um, it was just insanely,

586
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,120
it was more difficult than I had anticipated, you know, for a song like that, you know,

587
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,400
one of the first songs that's in the game.

588
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh, hey, it's really hard, but, uh, yeah, I'm digging it.

589
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,800
I like the, the, um, setup in the game, and the best part, of course, is playing as your

590
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
avatar.

591
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,760
So, you can DJ your own game.

592
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I have it on PlayStation, so.

593
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Well, that's why you chose Badda-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

594
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
Exactly.

595
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Oh, no.

596
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
You've got the soundboard.

597
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm sorry, I didn't load the soundboard before.

598
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,760
Now, do they have it where you can play as your home character, because, you know, Sony's

599
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,320
really innovative with all their home features, right?

600
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,240
Are you really asking that?

601
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Like really?

602
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Oh, Sony.

603
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I want to play it with my own me.

604
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
You know what?

605
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Let me, let me answer that with a sound.

606
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,440
Delayed radio, boys and girls, thank you.

607
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,640
I used the toilet today during the other podcast.

608
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,160
During that other show?

609
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,680
Which I have to say something about soon.

610
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
All right, we'll get to it.

611
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
We'll get to it during housekeeping.

612
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,680
We're hopefully going to have, we're hopefully going to have some DJ Hero music during the

613
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:36,000
break, although smart me forgot to bring my stupid, uh, VGA cable for my 360.

614
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,120
So I'm trying this really, you know, um, I guess MacGyver way of getting it to work by

615
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,760
hooking up my video capture card through my PC.

616
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,960
But uh, it doesn't like the fact that it's on two different networks, so I have to plug

617
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,520
it into the router.

618
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,560
But the router's cords are so short that I can't pull it out.

619
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,880
And Grand Theft Auto, that's what I played this week.

620
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,000
You can't pull it out?

621
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Can't pull the router out.

622
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh.

623
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,440
I don't want us to just start disconnecting random cords cause as if the storms weren't

624
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,760
causing enough problems with internet out.

625
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,520
Just last thing we need is Loki.

626
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,760
I think doing stuff.

627
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,480
I think I can pull the gray cord.

628
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
All right.

629
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,680
Cut the red wire.

630
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,440
We're running long tonight anyway, so if you can't do the music, it's all right.

631
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Oh, okay.

632
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,200
I'll just take a look at it.

633
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
All right.

634
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Anyhow, let's free cookies.

635
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Yes.

636
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Cookies.

637
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
We'll make it all better.

638
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
All right.

639
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Uh, Seg, how was your gaming week?

640
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,360
So I've been so busy, but I know you were going to ask me this question, so I really

641
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,600
made it a point to actually play games.

642
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:48,520
And I've been playing Costume Quest, which just came out on Xbox and PlayStation 3's

643
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,640
downloadable service.

644
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:58,600
And this is Double Fine's first let's not make a game once every five years game.

645
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,720
And it's really good.

646
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,240
They set out to make a nice, I'll say light RPG.

647
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:18,080
And the concept is you either play, I'll say the two main characters are twins, a guy and

648
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
a girl.

649
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,940
And there's literally the point in the intro cut scene where you pick which one you're

650
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,160
going to, which gender you're going to be pretty much.

651
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,880
And the one you didn't pick gets kidnapped by monsters who are trying to collect candy.

652
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,600
But the adults think that they're just big kids dressed up so that you don't believe

653
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,200
the kids that there are real monsters out there.

654
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
It sounds like Saw for children.

655
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,620
Well, the...

656
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,760
Make your choice.

657
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,440
And you're wearing costumes because it's Halloween.

658
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,160
But when you go into battle mode, the costumes that are like, you know, cardboard and tape,

659
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,480
they turn into those characters in battle mode.

660
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,920
So there's a robot costume and then, you know, when they go into battle mode, they turn in

661
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,800
basically your robot mech warrior type character.

662
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,640
I'd totally be down for a G-rated Saw movie.

663
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
What would be the point?

664
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,480
It would be funny.

665
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,840
Anyhow, I've also been playing Game Dev Story on the iPhone because, you know, I can't get

666
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,080
enough of game development.

667
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,400
And it's a nice little game.

668
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:32,320
It feels like it was a cell phone game, like your, you know, before the iPhone, you know,

669
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,200
the days of before, before, before.

670
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:44,560
But it's a really nice little game that I can play a little bit and put it to a side.

671
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:56,200
And then I got something else as I pull out my Rock Band keyboard, and I've been playing

672
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:05,600
Rock Band 3 over the weekend for research for Room Loud, because, you know, because...

673
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,520
There's no fun to be had this weekend.

674
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Oh, no.

675
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,040
Well, it really is because we really try to make the main stage as smooth as possible

676
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,040
because the more time we dilly-dally, the less bands get on stage, and we can't stop

677
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,320
the rock, cannot stop the rock.

678
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,280
So are you going to have up to seven people?

679
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Because...

680
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Yeah.

681
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Awesome.

682
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,320
You know, obviously, if it's a Rock Band 1 song, well, you know, it's a Rock Band 1 song.

683
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,480
But if the song supports it, yeah.

684
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,880
So for harmonies, though, we have all three mics, and they're actually plugged into the

685
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,440
sound system before they're plugged into the game.

686
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,040
So we just have the mics on all the time, and people can just do harmonies or whatever

687
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,020
anyway.

688
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,480
So even if you have, like, a Rock Band 1 song, if you want to have backup singers anyway,

689
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
no harm, no foul.

690
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
No harm, no foul.

691
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Yeah.

692
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,240
And it's not about the score anyway.

693
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Exactly.

694
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,880
So, awesome.

695
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,040
It gives the sound engineer actual control with the voice, and then, you know, to make

696
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,160
you sound good.

697
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,080
So I know you haven't been able to spend a lot of quality time with Rock Band 3, but

698
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,760
what do you think at first impressions, a worthy upgrade?

699
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:20,040
It is definitely harmonics finally putting into practice the years of research and all

700
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
the things they've learned.

701
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,760
Not that they haven't, but it's just, they now, they got it.

702
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,960
You know, like, then they're able to put it together, and it really shows.

703
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,660
I like how career mode is sort of always on, in the sense that even when you're just doing

704
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,080
quick play, it's still contributing to.

705
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
That's so awesome.

706
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Thank you.

707
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:50,280
Yeah, so there is career activities, like, very, you know, structured career activities

708
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,800
of like, okay, here's two songs and a set of five go, and then, you know, an achievement

709
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
is associated with that.

710
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,440
But just in general and in broad is just play the game, and it's just always, it's ranking

711
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
up.

712
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,160
It's more of raking up the personal, your personal account.

713
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,720
So it's really stressing more of bringing your profile, putting it on your USB stick

714
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,240
when you go to your friends, and then you're raking up when you're at your friends' place

715
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
and doing that profile.

716
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Oh, cool.

717
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Well, that sounds really interesting that they're doing that.

718
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Yeah.

719
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
So you don't have to make all these separate bands anymore.

720
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
That's kind of cool.

721
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Sounds very interesting.

722
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,080
So, um, let me ask this real quick.

723
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,040
What was the first song you had to play?

724
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,120
What was the first song I should have recorded that?

725
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,600
Ah, oh, I thought there might have been, no, I forgot.

726
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,640
I started doing career path and I just, I'm totally blanking on it, but the first, uh,

727
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:52,340
keyboard song, uh, Rock Lobster, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, which are the correct

728
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,680
answer should have been Bohemian Rhapsody.

729
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,520
Oh, I'm sorry, SAG.

730
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You lose.

731
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
No, I'm saving.

732
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,640
Ah, that button's never going to get old.

733
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
That's my favorite button.

734
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,240
But, uh, no, I'm saving that for when I, when I play with, uh, friends of mine.

735
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,960
So get that you need a band for, cause it was just me playing alone.

736
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Fair counterpoint.

737
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
All by myself.

738
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,500
I saw the trailer for Pro Mode.

739
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,120
That was pretty crazy with the new guitars.

740
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Yeah.

741
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Wow.

742
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Yeah.

743
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
The, the, the pro guitars.

744
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Um, damn.

745
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,240
And the, the MIDI Stratocaster that they're working on?

746
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,480
Well, actually the, so the, the MIDI stuff like the, the Rock Band 3 keyboard itself

747
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,680
is MIDI out ready.

748
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:42,360
It has, it is a MIDI keyboard and, um, they, on November 28th, they'll have a breakout

749
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,920
box, uh, for real professional MIDI instruments and just to plug it in directly into, uh,

750
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,280
the console itself.

751
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,480
I can't, I can't tell you how excited I am for Pro Mode keyboards.

752
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Oh yeah.

753
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Oh yeah.

754
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,160
And that's, that's, that's, that's beauty because you can do Pro Mode with the Rock

755
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Band.

756
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Yeah.

757
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Keyboard.

758
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,560
I mean, the, the only thing that you out and out need new equipment for is guitar for Pro

759
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,200
in regards to Pro Mode.

760
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,520
Drums, you do need the add on the, for the extra simples.

761
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,040
You're talking about the new ones cause the old ones kind of suck.

762
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,560
Well they're not doing a new, new Rock Band drum set.

763
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,080
They fixed the cymbals a bit.

764
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
They made it more sensitive.

765
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,760
But the cymbals, the add on pack is new, but they're not, there's no Rock Band 3 drum base,

766
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,320
you know, the, the base of the drum kit.

767
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,840
There's no new Rock Band 3 one.

768
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,480
It's just, they're now packaging it with the new, uh, cymbals.

769
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,400
They don't have Pro Mode for singing in there.

770
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
No.

771
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,920
Well, what, what is Pro Mode?

772
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Well, you get harmonies.

773
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Pro Mode's Oom-Loud.

774
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,360
Ah, nice.

775
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Like that.

776
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,600
And honestly, if you go into whatever the hard mode is, it's pretty hard.

777
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Yeah.

778
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,080
On Beatles Rock Band, I mean, these are songs that I grew up with that I wasn't hitting

779
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
perfectly.

780
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
So.

781
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,760
It, it, I also do want, you know, John Drake will, will thank me for this, you know, Pro

782
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,120
Mode is great when you want to go to Pro Mode, but don't feel that you're losing the essence

783
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,760
of Rock Band if that, that just doesn't attract you.

784
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,720
Um, I've actually, we're actually discussing taking a guitar, Pro Guitar off the table

785
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,000
for Oom-Loud just because it's too new.

786
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,240
It's an instrument switch and we want to focus on performance, you know, people performing

787
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,200
and not just going on this technical prowess.

788
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,760
I think you, you would be fair to say, you know what, it's too much of a pain in the

789
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,720
butt to swap out the guitars every time.

790
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
Now all you have to say is those guitars are too damn expensive.

791
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Done.

792
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Sorry.

793
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Uh-uh.

794
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,200
We sold the guitar and gave the money to kids.

795
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Deal.

796
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
All right.

797
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
All right.

798
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,240
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us?

799
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,000
Um, a little bit of a Scott Pilgrim, trying to finish that out, but then Costume Quest

800
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
came out.

801
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So there's that.

802
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
All right.

803
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,280
Since I, I'm going to get crap from Bobby Blackwell if I don't try to try to get you

804
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,040
free info on this at some point, because since you haven't brought it up, your day job, you

805
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,120
do work for a certain developer out there that makes a lot of amazing adventure games.

806
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,080
Um, is Back to the Future as awesome as it sounds?

807
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,120
Oh, it sounds awesome.

808
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:34,280
Because if you go to TelltaleGames.com and go to the blog tab, you'll, it's on game trailers,

809
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:46,080
but we just, or Telltale just posted the quick little interview with the voice of Marty McFly,

810
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,560
who, it isn't Michael J. Fox, though, he, he did give likeness rights and all that.

811
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
And I'm trying to...

812
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,040
He sounds very close to Michael J. Fox.

813
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,320
Yeah, and let's not forget Michael J. Fox is about twice as old as he was when the movie

814
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,920
first came out, so, you know.

815
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,200
And I, I still have to say, he didn't give his likeness rights for the pinball table,

816
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,000
so this is kind of big.

817
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,720
Um, AJ LaRosso, I'm, I'm probably mispronouncing his last name and I apologize, but all I'm

818
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:23,120
just going to say, go to the video and, and, and, and you'll, you'll hear how good it sounds.

819
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,600
Now did you get Biff?

820
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:33,320
Uh, I, you know, AJ is doing a great job with sticking on target, um, uh, we do also have

821
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,280
Christopher Lloyd as, as doc, he's voicing and everything.

822
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,560
You need to seriously get him to say every word in the dictionary because that guy is

823
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
not getting it.

824
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
Get him while he can.

825
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,320
Yeah, get the phenom table on him, yeah.

826
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,720
All right, I'm not going to pry too much on the day job because I respect that, you know,

827
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,160
you're a friend and we don't want to see you get fired for saying too much on the show.

828
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Well, talk about my game, like, puzzle issue.

829
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Let's talk about what's out.

830
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
Puzzle agent.

831
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Yes.

832
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Puzzle agent.

833
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:05,840
Uh, which is actually, um, uh, art style of Graham Annabelle, um, who, uh, does the dank

834
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,160
or dunk depending on what mood he's in, uh, comics on the telltalegames.com website and

835
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:17,820
also has a lot of, uh, video shorts and we made a game with really his art style, but

836
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:25,240
new characters of Nelson Tethers, puzzle agent, the single agent of the FBI department of

837
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,400
puzzle research.

838
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Cool.

839
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,080
Uh, they have that.

840
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
They do now.

841
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
They do now.

842
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,600
Uh, and, uh, it, it was, it was a great game to work on.

843
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:43,120
Uh, it, it was the, the first full-time content programming title that I worked on, um, at

844
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,800
Telltale and it's just, it was really fun working with it.

845
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,600
It was, I also did some puzzle design.

846
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,680
Mine's the second puzzle you show up, a few spruced around in there and the last puzzle.

847
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,880
So, uh, I, I won't give away what they are because you should play them, but, uh, no,

848
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,520
it's, it's, it's a, it's, it's a puzzle game with a plot and we try to do, made the, make

849
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,760
the puzzles, at least the, the critical path ones, uh, relevant to the plot enough.

850
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,840
Uh, you know, obviously there's a suspension of disbelief, but try to not do something

851
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,080
like, I, I can tell you this key important thing you need to know about the plot, but

852
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,200
first, here's a puzzle of matchsticks.

853
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:33,640
Uh, but, um, uh, apparently we're having just, we're having drama.

854
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,520
The cat's like, she looked like she wanted to get out and then, and then the moment Rob

855
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,800
moved away, she's like, nah, sorry about that.

856
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,000
It's quite all right, um, but, uh, no, it's a puzzle of its own that the cat's trying

857
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
to solve.

858
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,280
She's having a whole little puzzle thing down here of her own, so, sorry, but, uh, no, it's,

859
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,440
it's a nice little fun game.

860
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,280
It's out on platforms, uh, iPhone and PC, right?

861
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,600
iPhone, PC and Mac.

862
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Oh, okay.

863
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
And Mac.

864
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
Yep.

865
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Can't forget them.

866
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
Uh, yeah.

867
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
Okay.

868
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I think I've plugged enough.

869
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
All right.

870
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
No, that's no problem.

871
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
We, we appreciate, uh, you being here.

872
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
You can plug whatever.

873
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Um, I'm not gonna, I don't, I don't even know what you're working on now.

874
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,400
You probably couldn't talk about it anyway.

875
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,720
Um, but, uh, best of luck with all the upcoming projects over there at Telltale and keep up

876
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
the good work.

877
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,280
Oh, and just saying, there really, really should be an Elvira adventure game.

878
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,360
Just so that you haven't heard last week's show, we're just thinking, you know, speaking

879
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,600
of celebrities you want to get for the two old Elvira really needs a good, good game

880
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
treatment.

881
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
So just something to think about for next Halloween.

882
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Okay.

883
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Just throwing that out there.

884
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Okay.

885
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Uh, let's see.

886
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,160
I was trying to think what it was.

887
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I knew there was a game.

888
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
Yes.

889
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
It was the Elvira game.

890
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
What was it?

891
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Was it Golden Girls?

892
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
No, that wasn't.

893
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Well, that too, actually.

894
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,320
But that's, that's going to be a little hard to do now.

895
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Yeah.

896
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,480
You're not going to really be able to get Bea Arthur, but you might be able to get the

897
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,680
drag queens that play the Golden Girls in San Francisco around the Thanksgiving season.

898
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
Forget it.

899
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
All right.

900
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
Uh, let's see.

901
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
My gaming week.

902
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,360
I was all excited this week because Alan actually bought me a game and you'll appreciate this.

903
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,800
Alan actually bought me a copy of Poker Night.

904
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,560
Oh, bless his heart.

905
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
Yes.

906
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,160
He bought me a copy of Poker Night because Steam was having an awesome little pre-order

907
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,280
thing on it and he's like, oh Rob, I bought you a game.

908
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Let's play the game.

909
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,480
And then it's like, oh, the game's not out yet.

910
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Yeah.

911
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
Not quite out yet.

912
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,400
But I'll be ready to go.

913
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Day one.

914
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
So thanks for that, Seg.

915
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
No problem.

916
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,440
I had to rash on that at some point, but no, I obviously it's, it's, it's going to be cute.

917
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,600
You know, I'm, I'm not, I get, okay, I'll plug Poker Night.

918
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Fine.

919
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm not, I'm not looking for anything like, like my expectations going into this game

920
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,820
are not like, I'm, my world is going to be rocked.

921
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,200
It's just going to be like, it's going to be a cute poker game with funny characters.

922
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,080
Well, we've, we've, we've been telling people like, yes, it's, it's Texas Hold'em Poker

923
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:02,200
with, uh, Tycho, uh, the Heavy from TF2, Max of Salmon Max and Strong Bad.

924
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:09,040
And it has more dialogue than any single episode of a Telltale game.

925
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Wow.

926
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,880
So, you know, it's not going to be five lines repeated for every single play all the time.

927
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,360
Every, you know, there's, there's going to be some variety to it.

928
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,240
You know, and it's five bucks, you know, selling those like hotcakes at PAX actually, because

929
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,920
we also threw in a poster with it.

930
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Nice.

931
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,480
I tried for three days to buy it.

932
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,960
What, how does that work?

933
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,560
My PayPal hasn't ever, hasn't ever gone through, so.

934
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,760
Well, now whose fault is that?

935
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,760
Not mine.

936
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,040
It's Valve's problem, Steam or whatever.

937
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,640
But uh, yeah, so Poker Night is, is coming out soon.

938
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,640
Yeah.

939
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
And, uh, they haven't even told me, so.

940
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
I know, it's all good.

941
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
So, all right.

942
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,640
Well, that's, that's, that's really cool to know there's all that dialogue, because honestly,

943
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,200
my expectations going in, I was thinking, okay, this is just going to be like an Xbox

944
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,080
Live Arcade style poker game with, you know, characters I recognize.

945
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,080
So that's cool.

946
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,680
That's, that's, I hope there's a lot of trash talking.

947
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,520
That sounds like it could be, could be a part of it with all that dialogue.

948
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,320
Mouths are said.

949
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,760
Words come out of mouths.

950
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,280
There may or may not be playing cards in the game in some shape or fashion in Poker Night.

951
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,020
All right, no, all right, all that stuff aside.

952
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,020
So I have that to look forward to.

953
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,920
I will say a game I did buy on Steam that is out and has been out for a month that I

954
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
played this week.

955
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,080
The listeners should be very proud of me because I don't think WoW was the game I played the

956
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,600
most this week, shock and awe, but World of Warcraft was probably actually down there

957
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,120
on the ladder this week because I finally got Civilization V on Steam and I've been

958
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,480
playing the heck out of Civilization V because it's, um, it's great.

959
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,040
It is probably, I haven't decided if I like it more than four yet because I haven't truly

960
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,480
got to the end of a game yet because it is so long.

961
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,680
Oh my gosh.

962
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,680
But it's good.

963
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,680
That's a good thing.

964
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,320
But I definitely like, it's way better than two or three in my opinion, way, way better

965
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,400
than three, that's for sure.

966
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
But it's great.

967
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,680
Um, the hex tile thing is actually one of the things I noticed the least.

968
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,520
It's a very fluid transition for the series and a very kind of like logical next step.

969
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,680
I really like a lot of the subtle changes they made.

970
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,240
I like the fact you can't stack armies on top of each other and just like super army.

971
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,840
I kind of like the fact that only one unit can defend a city so you can't have these

972
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,480
Uber cities, you know, and just, just kind of like all these, like really, it makes you

973
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,680
kind of have to think a different way.

974
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,840
I like that they have talent trees that they call social policies basically.

975
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,720
That's kind of a neat addition.

976
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,920
There's all these cool little things they've added, very customizable games, lots of difficult,

977
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
lots of difficulty levels, lots of sizes.

978
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,120
The city states thing is really neat.

979
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,160
I didn't think I would like it at first.

980
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,400
A city state is basically a whole new civilization that is only ever one city.

981
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,200
They don't aspire to grow.

982
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,440
They don't aspire to do anything but exist in their little city state, but they can really

983
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,240
make you or break you because if you, if you treat them well, then they give you gifts.

984
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,280
They're like, we like you have a rifleman army courtesy of us.

985
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,540
Or they might say, you are a jerk.

986
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,920
We are going to pay the French to try to kill you, but ultimately they will surrender as

987
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
they did to me earlier in the week.

988
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
I got the French to surrender.

989
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Big surprise.

990
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,120
That's like getting the sun to shine.

991
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,360
I just had to work that in there somehow.

992
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,820
Not only did I get the French to surrender, but the French gave me Pittsburgh.

993
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,680
Really how they had that, or no, sorry, Philadelphia.

994
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,240
How they had Philadelphia, I don't know, but I got it now.

995
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,120
All of those sandwiches are so French, maybe the bread.

996
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,120
It's now a Greek city in my game because of course I'm playing as Alexander the grape.

997
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,920
Do you remember Otter Pops when you had Alexander the grape?

998
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
Yes, I do.

999
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
I want one.

1000
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
All right.

1001
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Okay.

1002
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
It's not the show if we don't talk about food.

1003
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
I know.

1004
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
I know.

1005
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,920
All right.

1006
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
So step five.

1007
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Awesome.

1008
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Loving it.

1009
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,920
I haven't even touched the multiplayer end of it yet because I'm afraid to play against

1010
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
it because they're very good.

1011
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Yeah, I haven't even done that.

1012
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,820
But long games.

1013
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,960
Like I am seriously playing on short mode and I've probably, like the shortest turns

1014
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,520
there is, and I've probably sunk at least a good three to four hours in this game and

1015
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,660
it's not done yet.

1016
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,560
Like I'm just now getting into like having like artilleries.

1017
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Well, part of the game is-

1018
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,200
Well, it wasn't my city.

1019
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,200
Okay.

1020
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm just saying you said the French gave it to you when you were in Greece.

1021
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,680
It's kind of interesting how that worked out.

1022
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,680
Okay.

1023
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,880
I totally forgot what I was going to say.

1024
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Oh yeah.

1025
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,520
It's impressive is like you can always save, but it's always that one more turn.

1026
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
Yes.

1027
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Yes.

1028
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,520
Oh God.

1029
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
Yes.

1030
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,520
That's what makes fun because it's always one more turn.

1031
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,840
I didn't go to bed till one AM the other night because of one more turn.

1032
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,800
Just one more turn and Paris will be mine.

1033
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,640
And it was.

1034
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
So just saying.

1035
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,640
The Fazenator said a junk ferret running around Paris will get France to surrender.

1036
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,640
By the way, I do want to also acknowledge our chat room.

1037
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,640
I've been such a bad boy.

1038
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,120
I haven't acknowledged chat all night long, chat.orangelaundry.com.

1039
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
Please join.

1040
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,120
They've actually been a little bit quiet tonight.

1041
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,120
I don't know.

1042
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Chat room.

1043
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
Rob needs a spanking.

1044
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Memorized by my voice.

1045
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,120
Maybe they're...

1046
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
Yes.

1047
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,120
Maybe they're just...

1048
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,520
Well, of course, sadly, we don't have a whole lot of people from the Bay Area.

1049
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,520
So I think we got a lot of people that are kind of like, oh, sounds cool, but plane tickets

1050
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
cost a lot.

1051
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Yeah.

1052
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
But we do have...

1053
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,800
I know a lot of podcastees in the Bay, so hopefully we'll see a lot of them at the show.

1054
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,560
I know I'm going to go come hell or high water, so I'll be there for sure.

1055
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,760
Well, also, actually, for the...

1056
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:37,040
I don't know about other local physical events happening yet for Child's Play, but there's

1057
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,600
also Desert Bus for Hope, the loading ready run guys.

1058
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,920
They're starting...

1059
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
I want to say them...

1060
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Actually, I know.

1061
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
I got it on the calendar.

1062
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:54,400
So these are the folks that play Desert Bus as a marathon run for Child's Play charity,

1063
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,920
and they start November 19th, unless things changed around a bit, but they'll do the live

1064
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,240
stream and all that on the 19th, which is definitely interesting to watch because, yes,

1065
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,360
they're playing Desert Bus, but they're also a comedy troupe, so they really make it a

1066
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,960
telethon show with it.

1067
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Awesome.

1068
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,720
I've tuned into a little bit of it before.

1069
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
It's funny.

1070
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,720
It's funny sometimes.

1071
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,720
Also...

1072
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
What a crap game to be playing.

1073
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Hmm?

1074
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
What a crap game to be playing.

1075
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
Yeah.

1076
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
So long.

1077
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,720
But...

1078
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
That's the joke.

1079
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,720
Hey, thanks for the money.

1080
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,720
All right.

1081
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
And also, UmLoud will be streamed live.

1082
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,640
I forgot about that.

1083
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:37,800
So starting at 7 p.m. California time, go to timeanddate.com to figure out what that

1084
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,040
means for you.

1085
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,280
The event will be streamed live, so you can actually watch the performances.

1086
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,000
The UmLoud website will change over to that mode when it's actually happening.

1087
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,960
And last year, weren't you the most streamed event in the lounge's history or something?

1088
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Well, no.

1089
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
We killed their internet.

1090
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,960
Good job.

1091
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,760
Well, we didn't kill it, but we were the most...

1092
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,220
The one event that used the internet the most, this being from a venue that is currently

1093
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,360
owned by one of the co-founders of Netscape, so we're very proud of that, and they actually

1094
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,440
increased wireless capacity after that.

1095
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't want to say it's because of us, but, you know, feather in our cap.

1096
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,600
All right.

1097
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Congratulations on that.

1098
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Thank you.

1099
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
All right.

1100
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,400
One more game that I played this week I want to talk about is DJ Hero 2.

1101
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,760
Even though Loki kind of already talked about that a little bit, I just want to give my

1102
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,160
spin on it, pun intended.

1103
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,040
I wasn't going to buy the game originally because I was like, oh, you have 60 bucks.

1104
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
I don't know.

1105
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,000
I played it in one of those in-store demos, and I was like, okay, I guess I got to buy

1106
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
this because it actually is really fun.

1107
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,240
They've actually changed a lot about the default interface, and it's not just the vocals that

1108
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,880
have changed, but now they have freestyle cross-fading, freestyle button pressing that

1109
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,200
makes a lot more sense than it did in the first game where you had, you know, yeah,

1110
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,480
boy, over and over again with the button.

1111
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,200
I love the way they're doing the freestyling now.

1112
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,200
It's so much better.

1113
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,480
And the freestyle cross-fades are great, and the scratching zones are really cool, so many

1114
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,320
more ways to freestyle and really ruin such great songs.

1115
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,840
I do appreciate all of that they've thrown in the interface.

1116
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,800
The head-to-head modes are more interesting.

1117
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,600
I like the interface as a whole.

1118
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,960
Even though the black and white look is a little bit, like, too plain, I just kind of

1119
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,840
like the construction of the game a lot more than I did the first mix.

1120
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:42,080
So it's a worthy upgrade in the interface and what it brings to the table.

1121
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,500
I gotta be honest, though.

1122
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,240
I don't think the song list is as good as the first game, at least the parts I've played

1123
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
so far.

1124
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,020
There have been a few really good mixes.

1125
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,120
Like there's this one I can't even get out of my head.

1126
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,440
It's the one that has Rihanna's Rude Boy in it that I can't get that sample out of my

1127
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
head.

1128
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
I'm a rude boy, boy.

1129
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
I'm a rude...

1130
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,300
And it's mixed with some other, like, slower R&B song.

1131
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,480
It's a really good mix.

1132
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,880
There was some, like, weird ones that I didn't recognize the song.

1133
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,320
There was one with a Tiesto song that was, like, an R&B song or something mixed with

1134
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
it.

1135
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,160
It was surprisingly good, actually.

1136
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,880
I will hopefully play those during the break.

1137
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
I'm attempting...

1138
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,640
This is like disarming a bomb over here.

1139
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,640
It's all right.

1140
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,640
It's all right.

1141
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,640
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

1142
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,640
No, it's gonna work.

1143
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,640
I've got the stuff to make it work.

1144
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,640
It's gonna work!

1145
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,640
You don't understand, Rob.

1146
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,640
We're not gonna stop and ask for directions.

1147
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,640
All right.

1148
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,640
One more bit of housekeeping.

1149
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
Please.

1150
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,640
Contest!

1151
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,640
Yes.

1152
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,640
Well, I wasn't done with my gaming week, but that's okay.

1153
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
They didn't finish.

1154
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
I got a cookie.

1155
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,920
I don't know what else to say about DJ Hero 2 that Loki didn't already say.

1156
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,480
If you like the first game, you're gonna like this game.

1157
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,520
I'm just a little bit disappointed in the soundtrack.

1158
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,020
There's some really good songs, though, don't get me wrong, and I think there's something

1159
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,040
for everyone here, but let me just put it this way.

1160
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,120
Like, I was threatened with domestic repercussions by my significant other if I played any song

1161
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,280
that had Soulja Boy in it one more time, so just putting that out there.

1162
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,960
If you're not a fan of some of these big club hits, you're gonna be in for a world of pain,

1163
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
so that's it.

1164
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,960
All right.

1165
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,320
Now we can get to housekeeping.

Dark Soccer has a contest.

1171
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
Okay.

1172
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,400
This is our contest, and the prize is going to be a code for Xbox Live to play Castlevania

1173
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,840
Symphony of the Night, which is a fun game, one of my favorites.

1174
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:43,120
The question is really easy, and we are going to be taking an emailer at a random number,

1175
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,220
which we will decide by literally rolling a die on the show.

1176
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:55,440
This is in relation to Comic Insanity, which is the other podcast that I do, and we broadcast

1177
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:05,240
every... We're actually up on Infamous, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net on Mondays is when the new podcast is up.

1178
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:11,480
The question you have to answer is what is the name of he who shall not be named on Comic

1179
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,480
Insanity?

1180
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,200
I'll give you a clue.

1181
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
We hate him.

1182
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,480
That so narrows it down.

1183
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,480
Wow.

1184
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
That could be anybody.

1185
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,380
It's me.

1186
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:31,520
Then you can send your emails to... I guess go ahead and send it to the mailbag here.

1187
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
I'll check it.

1188
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,760
Mailbag at OrangeDownsRadio.com.

1189
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,640
I will sift through it, and we will roll a number at random, and I'll pick a name.

1190
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
Awesome.

1191
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Now the other contest.

1192
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
More?

1193
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,480
Which isn't us, but a lot of people would be interested in this.

1194
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,120
Also at Infamous.net, there is a contest to win a bunch of Blizzard goodies from Blizzcon.

1195
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,620
If you missed it, there's stuff for you.

1196
00:57:54,620 --> 00:58:01,880
There are free pets, Cataclysm stuff.

1197
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:12,480
There's also a demo of Starcraft 2, and a few Starcraft 2 lithos, and some goodies.

1198
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,480
Lots of goodies.

1199
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,480
Lots of stuff.

1200
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,480
What do I have to do?

1201
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,480
Just send it a name?

1202
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,100
You have to go to Infamous.net and click on the contest link, and it's, again, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net

1203
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,520
... and click on the Blizzard contest.

1204
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,520
Follow the directions.

1205
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,440
You just basically have to fill out your information, let them know what you're looking most forward

1206
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,320
to for Cataclysm, which, you know what my response was?

1207
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
Nothing.

1208
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,280
Except maybe Plants vs. Zombies, but I don't play World of Warcraft, so, meh.

1209
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,520
You've been tempted to go back a couple times, though.

1210
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,520
I have been.

1211
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,520
Don't make me go find the time stamps.

1212
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,440
Well, just because Tiara told me that leveling is faster now.

1213
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,440
It is.

1214
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,440
And in Cataclysm, it's going to be even better.

1215
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,240
I hated leveling in freakin' World of Warcraft, so...

1216
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,240
Boo hoo.

1217
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Alright.

1218
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
I'm just messing.

1219
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,640
Star Trek Online is much more fun, because I can kill Borg and play with Klingons.

1220
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,920
How's that working out for you?

1221
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,160
Stupid fuckin' Borg.

1222
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,160
Alright.

1223
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Anyhow.

1224
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
I hate you, Borg.

1225
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
You know what's funny?

1226
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,440
I was on TV today, and I had to let my son watch it.

1227
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,760
Wrath of Khan in HD.

1228
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,680
I was like, well, Josh, this is the best Star Trek movie ever, so you better watch.

1229
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,960
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but that's not, that's not to say he was bored.

1230
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,960
He just...

1231
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
He's tired.

1232
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,960
Well, baby, sleep.

1233
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,960
Have you taken him to the theater yet?

1234
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,840
Make sure that you take him to an epic movie in the theater when he's still an infant,

1235
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,560
so that can be his first movie.

1236
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,560
Definitely.

1237
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,240
Mine was Star Wars.

1238
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,720
Good stuff.

1239
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,720
Yep.

1240
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Alright.

1241
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,000
Well, this might be a new record, guys.

1242
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,520
We're an hour into the show, and we have yet to touch gaming news.

1243
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,520
Woo hoo!

1244
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,520
Woo hoo!

1245
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,240
That's alright, so we're gonna kinda quickly move through some gaming news tonight.

1246
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,400
Uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

1247
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,440
Some gaming news, if you can get away through the MacGyver stuff for a moment, I don't know.

1248
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,440
I got the work, by the way.

1249
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,440
Um, of course.

1250
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,160
I am awesome like that.

1251
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,320
Xbox.com has gotten a makeover to kind of update everything, you know, with the new

1252
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,960
dashboard updates coming soon and whatnot.

1253
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,560
They've added avatar editors on the actual website, so now you don't have to wait till

1254
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,240
you get to your console to make your avatar look neat.

1255
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:17,440
Um, then also, apparently, they're gonna add some multiplayer web games, which, um, that's

1256
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
cool, I guess.

1257
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,680
I don't know if it's gonna be some more stuff that you can, um, do for, like, eh, if it's

1258
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,280
gonna tie in with different games, you know, like how they did with Crackdown and Facebook

1259
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,240
games and stuff, um, perhaps, but, uh, right now they're saying that they're gonna be able

1260
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:38,660
to play web games with your Xbox Live friends on the web or on Windows Phone 7, and, um,

1261
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,400
I'm sure those will be fun.

1262
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Yeah.

1263
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,240
Uh, and this is all, of course, uh, this already came out this week, and, um, so go check it

1264
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,240
out.

1265
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,640
Are any of those free games available yet?

1266
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,080
The web stuff, or?

1267
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,320
They were just teasing them.

1268
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,320
Yeah.

1269
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,480
They haven't really made them available yet, but the avatar editor's there, so you can

1270
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,680
check that out at least.

1271
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,120
They'll be coming out soon.

1272
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,100
Um, yeah, I'm glad that they actually updated the website, because there was a lot of stuff

1273
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:10,200
that was broken on there, like, you know, links to games and stuff, you're, okay, I

1274
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,840
wanna look up stuff about Crackdown 2, okay, that page doesn't exist.

1275
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,040
Well, when was the last time they changed that, that, the look of the page?

1276
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,360
I think it was even before the-

1277
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,960
The new Xbox experience.

1278
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,200
I think it was before the Xbox 360's launch, I mean-

1279
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
Yeah.

1280
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,200
No, I wanna say they had a change.

1281
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,200
I wanna say they did change it with MXC.

1282
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
No, I think they did update it with the 360.

1283
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
Yeah.

1284
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:35,440
I mean, it seems that they're doing this, this was more of, in line with the Windows

1285
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,560
phone, and all that, and they're trying to-

1286
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,760
Yeah, they're really pushing this-

1287
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,400
They're really pushing the phone, because, you know, let's face it, they're a competitor.

1288
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Yeah.

1289
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,840
Well, and let's also not forget that, you know, there's some stories this week about

1290
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:55,000
how AT&T is really starting to get behind these phones, because the rumors are starting

1291
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,200
to snowball a little more that they are going Verizon with the iPhone in 2011.

1292
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:06,160
And so AT&T is actually going to start pushing a lot more the Windows phone, I mean, not

1293
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,720
to say they're not gonna sell the iPhone anymore, but they're gonna also be pushing the Windows

1294
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,720
phones-

1295
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,720
Diversify the portfolio.

1296
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,720
Exactly, exactly.

1297
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,720
So, it'll be interesting to see if there's any truth to these so-called rumors.

1298
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:27,960
The thing I will say about this with the Xbox.com site that I wish Sony would do, is when you

1299
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:35,240
hear about a game that's available as a downloadable service, at least with Xbox, you can, if you're

1300
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,240
at work and you hear about it, you can buy it on the site, and you don't have to be at

1301
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,840
your Xbox, and you can make that purchase or say, okay, I want the demo.

1302
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,960
So then, when you get back to your Xbox, it'll be downloaded, waiting for you, and remind

1303
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,760
you that you wanted to look at the thing and play it.

1304
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,160
There's also just a lot more content on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

1305
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,880
There's always at least a couple games coming out each week, versus Sony, there may be a

1306
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,440
game coming out that week.

1307
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,360
It's not consistent.

1308
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,360
Unless you count-

1309
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,360
No, it's being consistent.

1310
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
It's-

1311
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,980
Unless you count their old PlayStation 1 classics that they're putting out.

1312
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:16,880
I mean, they could, really, for the both of them, they need to make, well, Xbox needs

1313
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,120
to make their indie game service or whatever, community games, however the fuck they're

1314
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,320
calling it now, they need to make it more like the App Store, where it's not just games,

1315
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,160
it's applications and stuff, and make it more, instead of just, oh, kind of, we're putting

1316
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,480
this in the back corner of our Marketplace, make it more-

1317
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,480
Showcased.

1318
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:41,960
Yes, exactly, because with the App Store, it's easy to spend money like crazy on a

1319
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,840
thing, and if they made it more like that, and had like, okay, hey, look, this feature

1320
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:52,240
now has, you know, weather updates, and this app does, you know, this and this, you know,

1321
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,920
I think that would be beneficial for them, especially since they don't have a web browser.

1322
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,160
All right, well, I will say, though, one thing about the website, one thing I tried to look

1323
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:09,160
up was the Game Room website, yeah, I wasn't there, I had to do a search for it, something

1324
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,640
not pretty is going on with Game Room, I'm sorry to say, but we'll see, just to kind

1325
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,240
of follow up a little bit from last week.

1326
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,920
Let me move on with some of the other big, big news this week, of course, something that

1327
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,600
was on a lot of people's minds, and this is really one of those, like, either you were

1328
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,080
watching every second of it, or you just kind of didn't care, BlizzCon was going on this

1329
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,080
weekend.

1330
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:32,560
Surprisingly, though, not quite the amount of information I think folks were expecting

1331
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,880
out of BlizzCon this year.

1332
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,560
Yes, there were some announcements, there were a few things, Diablo 3 seemed to be the

1333
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:43,000
most announcements, which wasn't a huge surprise to anyone, really, because we all know that

1334
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,080
Blizzard is pushing Diablo 3.

1335
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,640
Diablo 3's latest class, the Demon Hunter, is revealed, and that is supposedly the last

1336
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,160
class that's going to be in the game.

1337
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,520
Also, PvP Battle Arenas, that does sound kind of cool, that is also coming to Diablo 3.

1338
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,880
Those are some of the big announcements.

1339
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,640
One thing that was missing, though, was when?

1340
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:07,760
Not even a hint of a quarter or a year, really, for Diablo 3, so we're all left to just speculate

1341
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,840
as to the release date, otherwise it's pretty much just soon.

1342
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,120
On the World of Warcraft front, there really wasn't a lot to say.

1343
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,020
Cataclysm is coming out on December 7th.

1344
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:21,520
One of the things they confirmed is that they are going to be doing digital distribution

1345
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,520
day one.

1346
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:28,480
You will be able to download Cataclysm and play the minute it launches, which some might

1347
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,800
see as kind of a kick in the gut to some of the Game Stops and Best Buys of the world.

1348
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,200
Of course, you won't be able to get the Collector's Edition online.

1349
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,080
Maybe this is just a way for Blizzard to get people to buy both.

1350
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,280
I don't know, because I do know people that will buy both.

1351
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,200
They will buy this just so they can be there minute one, and then they'll go buy the Collector's

1352
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,920
Edition, because they are suckers.

1353
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,920
Addicts!

1354
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,920
Yes, and addicts.

1355
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,920
Buy more stuff.

1356
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,960
I love them, but they're addicts and suckers.

1357
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
Alright.

1358
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,800
Also, the Moonkin Hatchling is going to be the next World of Warcraft pet that is sold

1359
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
in the store.

1360
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
The rumor is it's another charity pet.

1361
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,240
I really couldn't get clear one way or the other if it's a charity pet or not, but they

1362
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,040
have confirmed that that is coming to the store.

1363
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,120
Starcraft 2 is going to be getting some scenarios for it.

1364
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,280
One of them is a Defense of the Ancients scenario, also Bejeweled and Left 4 Dead, some other

1365
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,560
interesting little kind of like versions of those in Starcraft 2.

1366
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,360
But I find the Defense of the Ancients one of the most interesting, because Valve, of

1367
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,560
course, has their Defense of the Ancients game.

1368
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,600
They actually got the people who originally did the mod now work at Valve, but yet Blizzard

1369
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,920
is now going to make their own.

1370
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,040
It's very interesting.

1371
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,580
So you're going to have Starcraft, or what they're calling Blizzard Defense of the Ancients,

1372
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,600
is going to be coming to Starcraft 2 soon.

1373
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,280
Again, no date there.

1374
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,900
So yep, folks went to BlizzCon.

1375
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,800
Some guy broke his leg while dancing.

1376
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,400
Tenacious D played.

1377
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,840
People spent 150 bucks.

1378
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,480
Hope you guys found it worth it.

1379
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,360
I really don't have any interest.

1380
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,160
As much as I'm an addict of War Program, I have no interest in BlizzCon.

1381
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
You know what?

1382
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,800
It's also $150.

1383
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,080
What's that, Seg?

1384
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,720
Ultimate Band Package for Umcloud on sale on November 1st.

1385
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,320
And I tell you, that's probably more exciting.

1386
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
That's probably a better deal.

1387
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,760
Honestly, you guys, maybe you can't say this year, are you guys doing the swag bag again

1388
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,920
for the Ultimate Bands this year?

1389
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,360
Oh yeah, I mean we don't know what's going to be in it, but we're going to do a bag.

1390
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,320
You're probably going to get better shit in those bags than you do in the BlizzCon bags.

1391
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,320
I think the BlizzCon bags...

1392
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,560
I can say that too, you'll get better stuff.

1393
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,400
Did they even get a pet this year in the BlizzCon bags?

1394
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,480
Yeah, they got another, it was another Murloc, I think.

1395
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,480
It was...

1396
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,480
That, yeah.

1397
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,480
That's it.

1398
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,200
It was a Deathwing Murloc, I think.

1399
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,200
So many.

1400
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,200
Was that correct?

1401
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
That's part of the giveaway.

1402
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
There's so many.

1403
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,920
They can go win one off Infamous Gamers and don't spend $150 to get a swag bag.

1404
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:48,640
I actually looked at the live blog for it, and I was like, so they announced a new class

1405
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,240
for Diablo, and that was it?

1406
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,500
I wonder if they didn't originally intend to announce the date for Cataclysm, but they

1407
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:04,640
got beaten to it by an inadvertent leak, because they were able to deduce, MMO-Champion deduced

1408
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,320
the release date of the game by things that were delivered in one of the patches.

1409
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,600
I'm not going to get into all the specifics, I don't want to bore the non-WOW players.

1410
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,600
But basically...

1411
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,000
There was some update that was supposed to happen a week after the Cataclysm event came

1412
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,360
out, and they dated that update, so...

1413
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,360
Yes.

1414
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,360
Exactly.

1415
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,560
And we have deduced that it is December 7th.

1416
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:31,920
So anyhow, that's what went on at BlizzCon, otherwise you had angry gamers asking questions

1417
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,120
and raging in the microphone at Blizz developers, because everybody's so mature, so that's all

1418
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,880
the stuff you missed.

1419
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,800
I tried to get people on Twitter to, I'm like, if you're going to rage question, then at

1420
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,880
least rage question about real ID.

1421
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:54,720
Do something that actually affects your real life, instead of like, stop nerfing my paladin!

1422
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:59,680
But I will say, if I may, since I am a Warcraft player and I'm teasing myself here a little

1423
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,680
bit.

1424
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,680
You may.

1425
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,260
That new patch that Blizzard did, although I really like some of the features and some

1426
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:09,680
of the changes they did, boy did they screw some things up.

1427
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,840
Like they have this bug in there right now, where like an icon turning into a certain

1428
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,040
shape will crash the entire game.

1429
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,560
It's called the cogwheel bug.

1430
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,000
And what's great about it is that for the Halloween event, in order to summon the Halloween

1431
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,420
boss, you gotta click the cogwheel on the Headless Horseman thing, the pumpkin, so pretty

1432
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,040
much everybody crashes out.

1433
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:36,600
They've been able to fix it with a third party fix that's available on Curse, but yeah, Blizzard's

1434
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,660
too busy throwing their party to really be on top of that right now.

1435
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,660
So whatever.

1436
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,440
Maybe I won't go back and play it.

1437
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,840
This new patch needed a little more testing, but Blizzard really wanted that game out this

1438
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,840
year so whatever.

1439
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:55,000
At least it's not as much of a hot mess as another certain MMO that came out and they

1440
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,760
had to extend the trial period of the game because it was so terrible.

1441
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,880
But anyhow, I'm not gonna go there again for another week.

1442
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,880
Alright.

1443
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,880
You don't understand, Rob.

1444
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,640
It still is the trial part of the game.

1445
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,120
It will be the trial part of the game for the next few years.

1446
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,700
All I have to say is some of my friends who I was really close with in the game before

1447
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:18,440
that have apparently gone into this new game and have said, oh wow, it's bad.

1448
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,180
Like it is really, really bad.

1449
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,480
Like I'll stick with Final Fantasy 11.

1450
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,160
Pretty well, yes.

1451
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,040
I was trying to be nice and not name names.

1452
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,600
Final Fantasy 14, that's right.

1453
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
That's the game that sucks.

1454
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
Final Fantasy 14 is fucking terrible, ahhh!

1455
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,600
It's terrible.

1456
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
I can't hold it in anymore.

1457
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,600
It blows.

1458
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,840
It's a brand new game.

1459
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:42,000
We have the same races, but we need them something more ridiculous and it sucks worse.

1460
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,920
Although I do remember one MMO that I played that was in beta for like seven years.

1461
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
Ragnarok.

1462
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,560
Ragnarok.

1463
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:54,000
And I played through the whole thing in several different languages.

1464
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,760
They better not hear you talking smack on our show or we ban you.

1465
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,760
I love Ragnarok.

1466
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,760
Permanently.

1467
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,760
You know, this must be...

1468
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,040
My account can't be banned on Ragnarok, even though I don't play anymore on the IRO server.

1469
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,040
Who'd you blow?

1470
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,880
Because I was a beta tester.

1471
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:13,800
All the beta accounts that played for the PVP testing got to keep their accounts.

1472
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
It's good to know.

1473
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
Yeah.

1474
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Alright.

1475
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,960
It must be a key to my personality, but the only MMO I've actually played with some length

1476
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,680
was Myst Online.

1477
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,480
Myst Online was kind of creepy.

1478
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:31,760
Myst Online was a great idea, and man, Zombie Game refused to die.

1479
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,000
I mean, that game got relaunched about four times.

1480
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And it was great.

1481
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,480
It just needed...

1482
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:47,360
There were just things that hung it up on interface-wise.

1483
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,960
And narrative-based MMO.

1484
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,920
That's a huge beast to fill.

1485
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,340
Let's see.

1486
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,640
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com.

1487
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:00,000
Tigerclaw says, talking about Blizzcon, one fan complained about the WoW characters looking

1488
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,880
like they came from Victoria's Secrets.

1489
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,280
The developer replied, what magazine do you want them to look like?

1490
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,280
Penthouse!

1491
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,880
Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat says, all the WoW players moved on to a better game.

1492
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,040
Hello Kitty Island Adventures.

1493
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,040
You know what's funny?

1494
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,680
Is that we were at Target the other day, and there was Final Fantasy XIV sitting on the

1495
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,360
shelf, and Alan's like, you should buy that.

1496
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,400
He's like, hey, hey, you should buy that.

1497
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,400
You should buy that.

1498
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,920
I'm like, I will buy this before I buy that, and I pointed at Hello Kitty Online.

1499
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,000
You know that Hello Kitty is getting her first Wii game coming in November.

1500
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
No one curr.

1501
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Alright.

1502
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
What?

1503
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You're not a fan.

1504
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,720
I remember me picking up a certain Batsmaru Hello Kitty game, and Rob going, oh girl,

1505
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,120
I want to play that!

1506
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,320
And me lending it to him.

1507
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,880
Says the person that has the Hello Kitty toaster.

1508
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,880
I deny these allegations.

1509
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,880
And Coffee Baker.

1510
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,880
All of them.

1511
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
I actually, I actually got.

1512
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,880
And a Hello Kitty TV.

1513
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,880
Hold on.

1514
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,400
Actually, it was a Disney Princess TV for one.

1515
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1516
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,400
That's much better.

1517
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:05,640
I gave it to a seven-year-old girl, and the Hello Kitty Coffee Maker is no more.

1518
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,640
It's gone.

1519
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,960
I got a real Coffee Maker.

1520
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,960
Yeah, I know.

1521
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,960
Alright, anyhow.

1522
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,280
You know what, Rob?

1523
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,240
If you really want to be cool, you'll just get a French press.

1524
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,240
Rob blinks.

1525
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,680
Moving on with more gaming news.

1526
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,680
Someone's phone farted.

1527
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:27,240
Well, this is a lot more cool than, a lot cooler than World of Warcraft, as I mess up

1528
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,520
my adjectives.

1529
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,840
Space Channel 5 Part 2, yes, the one with the full-on thriller Dance with Space Michael

1530
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,400
and apparently Ulala grabbing her crotch, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation

1531
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,520
Network, along with Sega Bass Fishing.

1532
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:51,400
We will see them in early 2011, and the good thing about Space Channel 5 Part 2 is that

1533
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,000
we never got it in North America, so this means we get to play it.

1534
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,360
Like, there's really a whole bunch of Japanese in it to change.

1535
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,360
I mean...

1536
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,440
Didn't we get, we got it on PlayStation 2 version, didn't we?

1537
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,680
Yeah, I think so.

1538
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,680
I don't know.

1539
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,400
I've got the Japanese one.

1540
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,440
With that freaking hard one where it does all the stuff and you have to do it backwards?

1541
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
Oh my god.

1542
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,800
Anyway, so yeah, but it's a Mizuguchi game.

1543
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,800
It's really fun.

1544
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,760
Space Channel 5, really, really like it, and I love Space Channel 5 Part 2, mainly because

1545
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,160
of the thriller dance, the whole section where they do just Michael Jackson dances.

1546
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,160
And Pudding is especially fierce in Part 2.

1547
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,240
I'm Pudding.

1548
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,760
She's my favorite, just for the record.

1549
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,800
Pudding is my favorite character.

1550
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,360
And Shermie has left the studio.

1551
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,680
You notice she did not step on your laptop?

1552
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,680
She's good that way.

1553
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,680
Good kitty.

1554
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,680
Yeah.

1555
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,680
Alright.

1556
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,620
Crushed his laptop.

1557
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:50,160
She is not that huge, and she knows better than to step on laptops because we got onto

1558
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,160
her.

1559
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,160
She'll get a kitty spanking.

1560
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,160
Alright, moving on.

1561
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
She likes it.

1562
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,160
More gaming news.

1563
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,800
Shermie does like spankings, by the way.

1564
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,800
We don't need to know that.

1565
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
She puts her butt-

1566
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,800
It's her family show!

1567
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,800
You're not her family show.

1568
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
No, for real.

1569
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
Like, if you-

1570
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,800
Fuck family shows!

1571
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,800
If you pet her on her lower back, she'll stick her butt up in the air and start purring.

1572
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,240
I don't need to know what your cat's into.

1573
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,600
Does your cat want a leather harness for Christmas?

1574
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,640
No, she's not into that.

1575
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,720
I'm sorry, your Hanukkah?

1576
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,320
My cat's not Jewish.

1577
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,320
She's agnostic.

1578
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,720
Okay.

1579
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:30,600
Apparently, there was a re- or, Ubisoft is recalling Shaun White's skateboarding on the

1580
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:36,460
PlayStation 3, which means I'm gonna have a lot of fuckin' work to do tomorrow because

1581
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:40,160
they've already shipped them all to us so that we got them to our customers, so we're

1582
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,240
gonna have to do a bunch of fuckin' returns on it.

1583
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:47,380
But apparently, and this was coming from some big name retailers, they're saying that there

1584
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:57,320
is issues with quality of the game, apparently, according to Sony, it says there was a manufacturing

1585
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,200
issue with misprinted disc at Sony Computer Entertainment America, and the wrong version

1586
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:07,040
of Shaun White's skateboarding PS3 was shipped to retailers.

1587
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,600
We were working with Ubisoft to correct the issue.

1588
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,800
New PS3 copies will be shipped to North American retailers by Thursday, October 28th, and it

1589
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,320
will be available by that weekend.

1590
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,320
Thanks.

1591
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,080
Thanks for all the work, you fuckin' dumbasses.

1592
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,720
Duh, we printed it wrong!

1593
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:32,120
Well, now Loki mistakes happen.

1594
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,120
Yeah.

1595
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,120
Whatever.

1596
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,600
You just don't like having the work.

1597
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,280
Was there some Arab song in this that someone got offended about, you know, playing the

1598
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,000
beta or something, like LittleBigPlanet?

1599
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,520
I did get one of those copies, and really, it was stupid.

1600
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:50,800
I liked it better with the lyrics in the game.

1601
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,920
I think Shaun White's skateboarding is intentionally supposed to be that bad, so that's a feature.

1602
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,840
Is this a big title, or is this...

1603
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
No.

1604
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,340
I'm like, how many people buy this game?

1605
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,160
Most people are like, Shaun White?

1606
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,640
Who the fuck's he?

1607
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,200
Isn't that the snowboarder?

1608
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,200
Isn't that the guy that looks like Carrot Top?

1609
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,440
Yes, it is the guy that looks like Carrot Top.

1610
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,440
He actually sk-

1611
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
I know who it is!

1612
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,920
He actually skateboards, but Tony Hawk has a game coming out, you know, Tony Hawk's

1613
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,920
charrette, and as far as I'm aware, Tony Hawk does not fucking snowboard, so...

1614
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,920
He's a poser.

1615
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,920
No.

1616
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,920
I don't know.

1617
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:21,920
That game is terrible.

1618
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,920
Not the Shaun White game.

1619
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,400
Shaun White game is decent, but Tony Hawk's terrible.

1620
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,920
Well if Shaquille O'Neal can do everything, like, you know, he had that whole TV show

1621
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,680
about Shaquille O'Neal does this and that, then, you know, why can't Tony Hawk decide

1622
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,680
to-

1623
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,600
And they're doing comic-style art of him.

1624
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,920
Shaquille O'Neal?

1625
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,840
And, cause, with the new, uh, Celtics lineup.

1626
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,760
We, but, you can listen to Infamous, uh,.NET's, uh, Comic Insanity for that.

1627
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,760
Plug plug.

1628
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,920
Uh, Salacious Pop is bringing us some LOLs in chat, um, has anyone actually seen Shaun

1629
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,920
White?

1630
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,160
What he needs is a line of shampoo and hair care, not video games.

1631
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:00,760
Uh, also, Salacious Pop, uh, mentioning Shermie, was, uh, walking out, and Salacious Pop was

1632
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,120
suggesting, um, uh, talk about the Sony move so she'll poop in the hall.

1633
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,720
She does that, every time we bring it up, she goes out in the hall and takes a big crap.

1634
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,320
I've got something better, um, I, uh, noticed when I was in the Sony Marketplace this weekend

1635
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,920
that there is a preview download for, is Shermie listening?

1636
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,120
Shermie, the tester season 2 has a preview trailer available.

1637
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,520
Do not get my cat to take a crap, because guess who has to clean that shit up?

1638
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,520
Me!

1639
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,520
Literally.

1640
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,140
Just say, the tester season 2, Shermie.

1641
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:37,120
And again, disclaimer, my cat is old and fat and can't get to the bathroom easily.

1642
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,520
She's fat and sassy.

1643
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,080
Let's talk about something else that's going to be very sassy, at least for, uh, fans of

1644
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,080
these series.

1645
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,080
As long as it doesn't involve cat shit.

1646
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,080
No, it doesn't involve that.

1647
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,800
Uh, Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright are going to be colliding.

1648
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,140
Worlds are colliding in a new 3DS adventure.

1649
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:00,400
What I love about this is that these are, like, two very culty kind of games on the

1650
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,400
DS.

1651
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,640
Like, either you play them and you love them, or you're like, what is this, I don't even

1652
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
know.

1653
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:11,920
So, somehow, and I, of course I'm looking at this going, how does this even work?

1654
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,680
How do these two games even, alright, whatever.

1655
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,080
Did you watch the trailer?

1656
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,920
I didn't, to be honest.

1657
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,680
Oh, no, the Japanese trailer is out.

1658
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,720
Yeah, there's actually a good high res one out, though.

1659
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,720
Oh, is there?

1660
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,720
Yeah.

1661
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,940
Um, but it was really cool.

1662
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:33,200
I sat and watched the whole thing going, haha, I can only understand half of this.

1663
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,600
Well, and it's going to be on the 3DS, and that's kind of awesome.

1664
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,040
That's the noise you hear in the background, by the way, is a little bit of the trailer,

1665
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,920
but that's like somebody filming an actual screen there.

1666
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:47,640
But anyhow, this is one of the four surprise titles that Level 5 has been working on.

1667
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:53,660
They are doing this whole, it's a combination of puzzles and crime mystery.

1668
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:57,360
You know, I guess that could kind of make sense.

1669
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,040
Are they biting a little bit from the other puzzle game?

1670
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,720
This is the FBI, the whole FBI investigation, this is starting to sound a little familiar.

1671
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,600
Say, guys, you might want to look into exploring a lawsuit on this, I don't know.

1672
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:13,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm just starting crap.

1673
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,440
You know, I mean, I'm excited for it.

1674
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:22,360
You know, I mean, it's the kind of thing of like, this can go horribly, horribly wrong,

1675
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,640
but there's a chance that it can go horribly, horribly right.

1676
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,640
But it'll be in 3D!

1677
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:35,640
Well, no, but seriously, though, I wait in eager anticipation to what this turns out.

1678
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,200
I haven't read up on it or anything, I don't think they even published much to anything,

1679
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:48,920
and it's probably in Japanese, and I'm a Gaijin, that's the right word, right?

1680
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,580
If you were in Japan, then yeah, you'd be Gaijin, but no, it's great, it starts off

1681
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:59,240
with someone being interviewed in court, and then you see the professor there, he's like,

1682
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:03,120
oh, talking, talking, and all of a sudden, this finger pops up, and this guy comes out

1683
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,960
of the shadows and goes, subscribe mas!

1684
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,960
As in, objection.

1685
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Objection!

1686
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,800
That means you're wrong.

1687
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:16,640
I love this way it's described here by Level 5 president Akihiro Hino, quote, two TV shows

1688
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,100
getting together and making a movie.

1689
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,560
So it's like Facts of Life meets Golden Girls, basically.

1690
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,640
There's got to be tons of cinematics from what they should, the trailer was long.

1691
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,520
I mean, really long.

1692
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,560
Well, I bet that's going to be pretty awesome, actually, so.

1693
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,560
Very cool.

1694
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,400
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get into release dates?

1695
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,240
Something that's even better than Sonic 4.

1696
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:42,080
And you know how we feel about Sonic 4.

1697
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,200
I mean, aw, okay.

1698
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,740
There are a group of Sonic fans, actually two people, that brought out something called

1699
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,920
Sonic Fan Remix that is actually absolutely gorgeous.

1700
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:02,300
I played it before the show, and didn't you think it was?

1701
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,300
It was pretty.

1702
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,300
It was pretty.

1703
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,300
Very pretty.

1704
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,760
It's got different mechanics from different Sonic games thrown in, except for the Dash

1705
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,760
thing.

1706
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,200
It looks gorgeous.

1707
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,920
I really think that, now one thing that I did notice when reading up on this is that

1708
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:22,520
they actually brought in tons of elements from Sonic CD, which that's really how it

1709
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:27,880
felt to me, playing, like it is playing Sonic CD.

1710
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,680
But they're doing so much of a better job than what Sega is doing, I mean, Sega should

1711
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,240
just be like, hey, we like you.

1712
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,920
But the people that are doing it is Pelican 13 and Mercury.

1713
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,960
The demo is out to download.

1714
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,720
You can go to Sonic Retro and find it.

1715
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:52,840
They also do have a direct, let me get the link for it real quick, because there actually

1716
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,840
is a direct...

1717
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,560
There's some comments from our chat about this from some people that have played it.

1718
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,840
Burr is in our chat room and says, my only criticism of Sonic Fan Remix is the backgrounds

1719
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,400
are so busy it can be hard to see.

1720
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,600
That's the problem that I had with it, too.

1721
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,280
I mean, really, that was the one problem I had with it.

1722
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:17,200
Okay, the website is just SonicFanRemix.com, all one word except for the dot com, which

1723
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,400
is a dot and a comma.

1724
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,560
All right, how long until Sega files a lawsuit?

1725
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,080
Anyone, anyone, anyone?

1726
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,080
Anyone?

1727
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,080
Sega should be embarrassed.

1728
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,920
And then they'll file a lawsuit.

1729
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,800
No, seriously, Rob, bring up the trailer, play some of the music, because the music

1730
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,800
is gorgeous.

1731
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,800
Sure.

1732
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,800
Let me bring that up here from the website.

1733
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
What did you think?

1734
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,760
Yeah, my only, you know, I didn't, I was just looking over your shoulder for it, but definitely

1735
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:47,120
the backgrounds are sort of like, too busy and it kind of illustrates how they're really

1736
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:52,560
going to 11 with the art, like, hey, look what we're doing, and gets a little too, just

1737
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,600
on the edge of showboaty with it.

1738
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,600
Yeah.

1739
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,840
But not stupid.

1740
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,840
It's noticeable, but it's not stupid.

1741
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,360
It's not completely detrimental to the game itself.

1742
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:11,760
I think it'd be something to get used to.

1743
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,080
Very pretty looking.

1744
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,400
I love some of the like interactive backgrounds, even though, yeah, the multi-layered background

1745
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,360
thing can get a little busy, but it kind of detracts.

1746
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,880
I really love some of what they did with it.

1747
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,880
Looks hot.

1748
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,920
I like it when it gets into my favorite part of this music.

1749
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,920
Kudos.

1750
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,920
Oh, which was next?

1751
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1752
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,920
There you go.

1753
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,920
There you go.

1754
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,920
Yeah.

1755
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,920
All right.

1756
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,240
I love that, that little like shark thing that jumps out as he's running over the bridge.

1757
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,600
It's like a big killer whale, I think.

1758
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,920
Little touches like that are awesome.

1759
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,160
And it even knocks, the blocks are all that same checkerboard pattern all around it.

1760
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,160
It's pretty fantastic.

1761
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:53,680
I'd have to say that this is an epic job and I hope it doesn't get shut down the way that

1762
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,160
the Chrono Trigger thing was, because that was also awesome.

1763
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,520
Well, Burr apparently has been following this pretty closely.

1764
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,000
He has a follow-up comment here in our chat room at chat.orangewise.com.

1765
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,920
The people on the forums about it say Sega won't do anything about it.

1766
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,880
Not sure why they're so confident.

1767
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,880
Hmm.

1768
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,880
Interesting.

1769
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,880
All right.

1770
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,560
Well, definitely worth checking out.

1771
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,960
Grab it now until it becomes a problem.

1772
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,960
That's my suggestion.

1773
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,960
All right.

1774
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,960
Let's go get some release dates.

1775
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,240
So, Loki, I know there's a lot this week, but I just want to point out we're already

1776
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:28,360
at an hour and a half for part A, so.

1777
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,280
In other words, if we cut out the Hello Kitty games, I think we'll be okay.

1778
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,280
No, don't worry.

1779
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,280
I won't read any Hello Kitty.

1780
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,280
I need more Hello Kitty!

1781
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:41,720
Uh, Shaun White's skateboarding actually came out today on Xbox 360, and we're disavowing

1782
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,360
any knowledge of the PS3 version, because that's not yet ready.

1783
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,120
The re-release of Dragon Age Origins, the Ultimate Edition, it's packed with all the

1784
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:56,720
download content, including the expansion Awakenings, and you can get that this week.

1785
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:01,880
Family Party 90 Great Games Party Pack that is also a compilation of the last three Family

1786
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,880
Party games.

1787
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,880
Yeah, I'm sure.

1788
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,880
90 awesome games.

1789
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,440
Uh, they're really popular, actually.

1790
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,920
You'd be surprised.

1791
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:13,240
Um, and like I said, Dragon Age Origins, that was on PC, PS3, and 360.

1792
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,160
Art Academy is a collection of two DSi games that came out previously.

1793
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,120
That's of course on the DS.

1794
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,880
Uh, let's see.

1795
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,880
Nerf and Strike.

1796
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,480
Man, it's just fucking bundles of stuff.

1797
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,520
The N-Strike Double Blast Bundle.

1798
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,240
It's with a gun in the two last Nerf N-Strike games.

1799
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,240
That's on the Wii.

1800
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:41,280
Cabela's Dangerous Hunts XI with the wireless shotgun, the top shotgun, and that's on Xbox

1801
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,200
360 and the PlayStation 3.

1802
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,120
Wii has like a gun shell that goes with it, but same type of thing.

1803
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,480
Also the game is available by itself on those three platforms as well.

1804
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:56,760
Uh, SBKX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1805
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:06,360
Smackdown vs. Raw, 2011 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP.

1806
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:17,400
Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PSP, and PC.

1807
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:24,000
Pets Cats Playground on the DS, Dora the Explorer, Dora's Cooking Club, that's on the

1808
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
DS.

1809
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,840
Sims 3 Late Night Expansion Pack, now you can have your own emo vampires in it.

1810
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,840
That's on PC only.

1811
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,840
Do they sparkle?

1812
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,440
I think they might.

1813
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:40,400
CSI Fail Conspiracy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1814
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,160
Also kind of another game similar to that on the Wii.

1815
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,160
Buy CSI.

1816
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:50,280
K. Well you know who makes that game right?

1817
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:55,120
They look terrible though.

1818
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,120
I'm hurt.

1819
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,320
Well they should try harder.

1820
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,400
Just kidding.

1821
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,400
Have you ever played one?

1822
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,400
I don't watch CSI.

1823
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,400
See if it was law and order.

1824
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,400
If it was law and order we'd be talking about it.

1825
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,800
Don't worry I got your back.

1826
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,800
Thanks Rob.

1827
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:14,640
Tony Hawk Shred coming down on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii, just don't buy it seriously.

1828
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:18,360
It's one of those games that requires a stupid skateboard to play.

1829
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,920
You know what that really should be?

1830
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,920
Skateboarding outside.

1831
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,440
Because if you have to buy a skateboard to play a game you should just skateboard.

1832
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,440
Done.

1833
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:30,440
Halo, that'd be funny this was Halo, no.

1834
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,680
Hasbro Family Game Night, Halo Family Late Night 3.

1835
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,920
It's a Spartan good time.

1836
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,920
Frag your friends.

1837
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,920
Frag grandma.

1838
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:44,200
No Hasbro Family Game Night 3 coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1839
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,200
Some more games with that.

1840
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,200
Okay.

1841
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:54,200
And I doubt that this is coming out on this date because why would you release this a

1842
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,200
good week early?

1843
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,200
But who knows?

1844
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,160
Fighters Uncaged, I believe that's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks.

1845
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,200
But that's the fighting game for the Kinect.

1846
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,680
That's of course on Xbox 360.

1847
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:07,040
Imagine Fashion Stylist, another game that you're probably not interested in, that's

1848
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,080
on DS.

1849
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:12,840
The Sims 3, that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii this week.

1850
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,080
DS and PSP as well, I believe.

1851
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,800
Deca Sports 3 on the Wii.

1852
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,580
And one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto IV, they're releasing a complete edition

1853
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:31,040
with both Grand Theft Auto IV and the episodes of Liberty City, all for $39.99.

1854
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:36,520
The Fights Lights Out on PlayStation 3, that is the move fighting game.

1855
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:39,840
That's coming out on PlayStation 3.

1856
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,520
Rock Band 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

1857
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,280
Oh I've heard of that one.

1858
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:54,060
Monopoly Streets on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and I believe DS and PSP.

1859
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:58,880
Pets Nursery 2 on DS.

1860
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,680
And Lego Universe on PC, that should be pretty big.

1861
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,400
Oh that's the MMO, huh?

1862
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,080
That is the awesome MMO.

1863
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,920
I haven't even heard a darn thing about that game actually, I'm kind of curious now.

1864
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,800
Mama is doing everything, now she's crafting.

1865
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,840
What kind of crafting?

1866
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,000
TF2 crafting?

1867
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,640
Arts and crafting.

1868
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,620
That is on Nintendo DS.

1869
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:29,160
But don't worry Wii fans, there will be babysitting in your future.

1870
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,880
Remington's Super Slam Hunting North America on the Wii.

1871
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:39,840
ZHP Unlosing Ranger vs. Dark Death Evil Man, that's on PSP, it has an awesome title.

1872
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,000
Blood Drive on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, that's going to be kind of like a Twisted

1873
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,240
Metal type of game, so definitely check that out, I think it could be a sleeper hit.

1874
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,040
Imagine Resort Owner, don't even bother.

1875
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,400
Mercury Limited Edition, why I keep re-releasing these games, no one bought them in the first

1876
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,400
place.

1877
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,200
That's on PSP.

1878
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:10,800
And Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Tag Force 5 on PSP, Fable 3 on Xbox 360, just a little game there.

1879
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:11,920
What's with these tie-ins?

1880
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:18,800
Mega Bloks, Diego's Build and Rescue, what you couldn't spring for the license for Legos?

1881
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:25,720
Oh and Power Geeks coming out this week, not to be outdone by Rock Band, but it will be

1882
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:26,980
outdone by Rock Band.

1883
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:34,240
That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and it is too damn expensive.

1884
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:40,480
Disney Channel All Stars Party on the Wii, Intellivision lives on the Nintendo DS, and

1885
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,040
Chevrolet Camaro on the Wii.

1886
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,080
It's lived like every year for the past 10 years in one way or another.

1887
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,080
Really guys, still alive?

1888
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,960
Like I like Intellivision at all, but it might be time for it to die.

1889
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,000
Alright, is that it?

1890
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
That's it.

1891
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Alright, moving on.

1892
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,400
Oh, I actually want to read some of the comments from chat, chat.ownerswansradio.com.

1893
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,840
Salacious Pop is giving us some dialogue that could be used in the Halo Family Party trailer

1894
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,080
actually here at chat.ownerswansradio.com.

1895
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,960
Quote, how the hell does grandma keep getting headshots?

1896
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,240
She has Parkinson's.

1897
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,360
I hate this game.

1898
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:20,960
Mom, granddad teabagged me and called me that mean word for gays and now everyone on my

1899
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,160
headset is griefing me and laughing.

1900
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:27,000
Coming to a store near you, Halo Family Party.

1901
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Right, Loki?

1902
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,880
I'm surprised they haven't gone there yet.

1903
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,880
They might.

1904
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,880
They might.

1905
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,880
We like money, cha-ching.

1906
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:40,400
Alright, moving on to the Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360, Fable 3 gets its Japanese

1907
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:47,960
release on the 28th, Raderji, Noah Massive, yes, Raderji?

1908
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,720
I don't even know what this game is, although I, no, yes I have.

1909
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:51,720
This is a shitty game.

1910
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,720
Raderji's a shmup.

1911
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,720
I've never seen this before.

1912
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,440
They have a version of it on DS2, I think.

1913
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,360
So yeah, Raderji is finally coming out on the Xbox, so check that out on the 28th.

1914
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:06,560
Also, World Soccer Winning 11 2011 is coming out this week on the Xbox 360 as well.

1915
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,640
Moving on to the Playstation 3 and looking at some of the releases there.

1916
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:15,440
Usually they pretty much get ports of the same releases on the Xbox 360, which yes,

1917
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:22,400
World Soccer Winning 11 2011, Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Edition is coming out this week

1918
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,360
in Japan.

1919
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:30,860
Also there is a slim console bundle in 160 and 320 gig models that contain the World

1920
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:36,440
Soccer Winning 11 2011 game, Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Edition.

1921
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:42,600
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii and the games that are coming out there this week.

1922
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,420
Really nothing, sadly.

1923
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,940
Nothing on the Wii this week, but that's because they got the Kirby Yarn last week just like

1924
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,080
we did, so the Wii's a little quieter this week.

1925
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:55,160
DS is a little different because the 25th anniversary DSi is out this week, so that

1926
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,600
is a pretty big deal.

1927
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:02,240
Also, Sola Torobo Sore Karakoda E is coming out this week on the DSi.

1928
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,480
There's a regular and a collector's edition.

1929
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,720
This is like a DSi enhanced version.

1930
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,880
It's from the creators of the.hack series.

1931
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,120
So it's an action sci-fi fantasy game.

1932
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,120
This is awesome.

1933
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,480
It's a world ruled by dog people and cat people.

1934
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,200
And you play a hunter.

1935
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:24,440
I don't know if you hunt the dog and cat people, but whatever.

1936
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:25,440
Sounds interesting.

1937
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:28,960
Take this, dog people!

1938
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,640
It's Alpo.

1939
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,160
It's super effective.

1940
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:35,780
On the Sony PSP, God Eater Burst comes out this week.

1941
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:37,680
That doesn't sound sacrilegious at all.

1942
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:41,720
Also Phantom Brave Portable comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.

1943
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:46,200
I've eaten so much God, I'm just gonna burst now.

1944
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:53,360
Dark Sakura?

1945
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:59,120
In the UK, on the 26th, we have BlazBlue Continuum Shift, Death Spank, which is the best name

1946
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:06,720
ever, Splatterhouse, and The Sims 3, are they just getting the Sims 3 expansion?

1947
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:10,240
On the 27th is Bloody Good Time, which I think is a fantastic name too.

1948
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:16,920
On the 28th is Super Scribblenauts, Fable 3, FIFA Manager 11, Football Manager 2011,

1949
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,720
which is real football and not what we call football over here.

1950
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:27,720
My Sims Sky Heroes, Rock Band 3, Sean White's Skateboarding, Star Wars The Forest Unleashed

1951
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:34,400
2, The Lord of the Rings Aragorn's Quest, Tony Hawk's Shred, TV Superstars, we sing

1952
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,240
Robbie Williams, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2011.

1953
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:43,440
And on the 30th, we have Sims 3 Late Night.

1954
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:48,680
And since we're not having a show next week, I'll go ahead and say on the 31st is Saw 2.

1955
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:53,220
I like Robbie Williams, like I know he's not a big deal here in the US, but he's pretty

1956
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:54,220
big everywhere else.

1957
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:55,220
Yeah.

1958
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:57,480
I can see why he's getting his own karaoke game.

1959
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:02,360
Alright, let's move on to some more news, and then the Classic Game of the Week is just

1960
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,960
a few steps away.

1961
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:04,960
Loki?

1962
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:05,960
Oh yeah.

1963
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:11,560
So this is kind of interesting, apparently, and I actually saw this on the news, which

1964
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:17,600
is kind of weird, but there was a lot of, or it was, I guess, brought up by the Wall

1965
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:25,000
Street Journal that there was a bunch of Facebook applications actually transmitting user IDs

1966
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,920
and other information, I guess, to third party advertisers.

1967
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:40,560
And of those applications, I guess, some of them were created by Zynga, including FarmVille.

1968
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,260
Apparently the three of the top ten applications, FarmVille, had been transmitting personal

1969
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:49,800
information about users' friends to outside companies.

1970
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:54,960
Of course, your user ID is publicly available and is by itself just a number, however this

1971
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:00,520
data can be, and as apparently the Wall Street Journal reports, is being shared with other

1972
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,520
parties specifically.

1973
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,160
Wait, wait a minute.

1974
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,160
Wait a minute.

1975
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:10,240
You mean to tell me that Zynga, the makers of that free FarmVille game and all these

1976
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,920
other free games that they knocked off from other companies, you mean Zynga, the company

1977
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,880
that's been called pure evil by many people on the internet?

1978
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,120
They've been raping my privacy this whole time?

1979
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,120
I know.

1980
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,120
Who would have thought?

1981
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,240
Well, if you're lying.

1982
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:34,960
If I understand it correctly, it wasn't that they're like, hey, here it is, but more of

1983
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:40,240
being able to access that data from other sites.

1984
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:50,120
So the embedded ads and just, it wasn't just like, here you go, please take it.

1985
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:56,680
It was just playing those games made that stuff more accessible to be grabbed and they

1986
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,720
took advantage of that.

1987
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:04,680
So wait, Amazon.com might know I'm gay because I've played FarmVille once in my life?

1988
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,640
I bet you have terrible taste in games apparently.

1989
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:12,400
Gosh, it keeps trying to, I wondered why it keeps trying to sell me like Will and Grace

1990
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,720
even season seven and funny girl on Blu-ray.

1991
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,360
I just couldn't figure that out.

1992
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:24,860
And because of this whole leak or whatever, of course what's going to happen?

1993
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:29,920
Some lawyers are going to catch wind of this and they're going to file a class action lawsuit.

1994
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,800
And that's what they did.

1995
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,800
Apparently-

1996
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,840
Because it's the American way.

1997
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,600
We're going to sue you about it.

1998
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:46,440
Apparently law firm Edelson McGuire filed a suit with San Francisco federal court, I

1999
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:50,480
guess by St. Paul, Minnesota resident Nancy Graff.

2000
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:54,840
They're seeking monetary relief for those whose data was wrongly shared and injunction

2001
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,080
relief to prevent continued privacy abuses.

2002
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,600
And it says no specific amount was mentioned regarding the extent of aforementioned monetary

2003
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,600
relief, but seeing as how the announcement claims the leak has affected 218 million Facebook

2004
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:14,720
users, we're guessing the damages will be significant or sought will be significant.

2005
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:17,440
Not necessarily what they get.

2006
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,820
Well, I don't know.

2007
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:26,620
I would say that's not too uncharacteristic for that company, but that sucks, I guess

2008
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:31,400
if you're into Farmville, but honestly, you know, with Facebook and stuff, a lot of your

2009
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:35,880
information is just kind of out there anyways, even if you're, you know, turning on your

2010
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,360
privacy settings and stuff like that.

2011
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:42,400
I just love though how, you know, this couldn't be timed any better because it always seems

2012
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:47,340
like, you know, that guy, that, that bro that runs Facebook is like a billionaire is always

2013
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:51,560
getting up on stage going, Hey, you know, guys, we're really working on the privacy

2014
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,600
thing and you know, we want your information to be secure and information and your security

2015
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,280
is our number one priority.

2016
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:01,780
And then, you know, it comes out like literally the next day, like Farmville is selling your

2017
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:06,520
information to the devil.

2018
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:09,200
Facebook creator is actually devil.

2019
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:12,560
All right.

2020
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,560
Yeah.

2021
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:19,280
So I did, we already went through this debate with a web browser cookies, which is essentially

2022
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,400
what's happening only.

2023
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,600
It's a different avenue.

2024
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,160
It's a super cookie.

2025
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:29,320
It's a super cookie, delicious, but I mean, but, but, but it just, it just seems like

2026
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:35,680
all it is is like, okay, we know this is a unique user and yes, attached to Facebook,

2027
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:40,720
but it's not, I'm not dismissing the issue, just trying to get more clarity on what the

2028
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,720
issue is.

2029
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,140
And it just seems like it's the same thing as the cookie of like, okay, unique user,

2030
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:52,400
but what knocked it up the next level is that this number, which was first just like, okay,

2031
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:58,100
plant there, this, this number we generate, so it can keep a unique ID.

2032
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:02,760
This time it's persistent, it's more persistent because it's attached to your Facebook profile

2033
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,460
and et cetera, et cetera.

2034
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:07,960
And so anything you post on Facebook might be publicly accessible.

2035
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,620
So, you know, lesson learned.

2036
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:13,760
If you're going to use a site like Facebook, make sure, you know, if you don't want to

2037
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:19,640
get it out there, don't post it or lock it down or even if you're locked down to private,

2038
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,200
like my Facebook is locked down, so only friends of mine can see it.

2039
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:26,120
And even then there's some things I just don't post on Facebook.

2040
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,320
You know, Rob, there is a good use of Facebook.

2041
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,800
What's that?

2042
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:34,520
Like umlaut on Facebook.com slash umlaut.

2043
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,520
Yes.

2044
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,800
Do you have all these, you had all these plugs written down on a sheet of paper.

2045
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
Wait till we get to Twitter.

2046
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,680
It's like you're playing a game.

2047
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,080
Which is umlaut, at umlaut.

2048
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,360
While we're at it.

2049
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,960
All right.

2050
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:54,000
Anyhow, quickly here, you won't be able to find Rockband on here.

2051
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,320
Sorry, umlaut fans, but one thing you will be able to find is a brand new Games for Windows

2052
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,840
Marketplace with lots of new stuff, I guess.

2053
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,560
November 15th is when the new Games for Windows Marketplace launches, because, you know, right

2054
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:11,640
now when you think about how can I download PC games on my computer, you usually think

2055
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:16,080
about, I don't know, Steam is one of the big ones or maybe Direct to Drive or even maybe

2056
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,280
that good old game site that may have that big old joke, haha, we're shutting down.

2057
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,280
No, wait, no, we aren't.

2058
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,280
I think a few weeks ago.

2059
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:25,040
You don't usually think about, oh, yeah, Games for Windows has their own Marketplace.

2060
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:28,200
Well, Microsoft's not happy with that and they'd like to change their perception there,

2061
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:33,920
so they are going to be beefing up their online portal with some more stuff.

2062
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,480
It's all going to be branded with the whole Games for Windows Live, more competitive and

2063
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,480
blah blah blah blah blah.

2064
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:43,440
They want to make it a store, really a destination for PC gamers.

2065
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,520
There's going to be stuff enabled through Live, all that good stuff.

2066
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:50,440
So they're going to be revamping everything on November 15th.

2067
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:51,920
So there you go.

2068
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,040
And they're saying you should show up on day one because we're going to have a great pre-order

2069
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,200
on a title you may care about.

2070
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,280
The speculation is that it's Fable 3 for the PC.

2071
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:03,280
Foreshadowing.

2072
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,400
You know what, though?

2073
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,240
If they can match some of those sales that Steam is having, you know what?

2074
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:13,520
Competition is not necessarily a bad thing because, you know, if they're going to try

2075
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,860
to one-up Steam, they're going to have to do so with some of the prices.

2076
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:19,040
So we'll see exactly how that goes over.

2077
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:23,200
In the meantime, let's get to a segment we like to do here on the show where Dark Sakura

2078
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:33,000
dips into the video game vault and says, hey, you ungrateful kids with your desert bus events

2079
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,400
and your oomblouds and stuff, you know what, you need to know where these games came from.

2080
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,200
Get off my lawn and go play these games.

2081
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,200
And while you're at it, yeah, that's right, no, we like to explore Gaming's Past.

2082
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,400
Just pull up your pants.

2083
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,400
Buy a belt.

2084
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,400
All right.

2085
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:52,240
We're going to explore Gaming's Past by checking out the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura.

2086
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,960
What is the Classic Game of the Week from the vault this week?

2087
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,360
I'm angry with myself for having never reviewed this one.

2088
01:43:58,360 --> 01:43:59,360
Sonic and Knuckles.

2089
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,160
I've done Knuckles Chaotix.

2090
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,720
I've done other Sonic games.

2091
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,160
Have not done Sonic and Knuckles.

2092
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,840
What is wrong with me?

2093
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:11,080
So this is something that Sega has done right.

2094
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,560
We have to start off with the noise.

2095
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,200
We always have to start off with the noise.

2096
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200
Yes.

2097
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:27,720
Best music ever.

2098
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,720
Sonic and Knuckles.

2099
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:33,480
They came out on the Genesis, also known as the Mega Drive overseas.

2100
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:39,560
And it was actually developed in the US at the Sega Technical Institute by members of

2101
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,240
Sonic Team.

2102
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:47,920
And it came out on October 18th, 1994, which was, guess what, the year I graduated high

2103
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,920
school.

2104
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:49,920
Woo!

2105
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,120
You're older than me.

2106
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,560
Bite my butt, Rob.

2107
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,560
I'm vintage.

2108
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,560
Shut up.

2109
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:03,240
Anyway, this was a, uh, you could play it by itself, and it also locked on to Sonic

2110
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,240
2 and Sonic 3.

2111
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:09,880
The game was actually developed with Sonic 2 and Sonic 3, so that's why it's got all

2112
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,840
the special little nummy goodies in it.

2113
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,400
Almost as delicious as these peanut butter cookies.

2114
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,840
Once you've got different stories, it actually picks up from the end of Sonic 3, um, after

2115
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,160
the Death Egg crashes.

2116
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:26,280
Um, oh, just by the way, Rob, I was playing Bayonetta, and I got that they were calling

2117
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:33,480
that dude Eggman, because that was Robotnik's name in the Japanese version was Eggman, anyway.

2118
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:39,480
Um, and so you have to go get the Chaos Emeralds and the Super Emeralds and all the stuff and

2119
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,840
be super awesome.

2120
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,000
And if you get all of them, you get, you turn into Super Sonic.

2121
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Yay!

2122
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,920
And you can go to the Doomsday Zone, yay!

2123
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:52,200
And then you can join, blow up the machine, yay!

2124
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:59,600
And return the Master Emerald, which leads right into Sonic Adventure, oooh, because

2125
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:04,920
the island crashes back down in Sonic Adventure, and Knuckles is pissed off at Sonic.

2126
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,560
Yeah, anyway.

2127
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,640
And then you've got Knuckles Story, which everyone just beats up on him, and he's like,

2128
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,880
well, crap, I'm tired of getting you, so I'm gonna go get all these emeralds too.

2129
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,880
And that's the Knuckles Story, don't you just love my paraphrasing?

2130
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:24,800
As far as the way it plays, well, you can't use Tails, oops, however, if you lock it on

2131
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:34,520
to Sonic 3, then you can play Tails, I mean, you just lock it on.

2132
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:40,000
It's got different bonus stages, you've got ones where you collect 20 rings by walking

2133
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,120
through these bumpers, and then you have the slot machines from Sonic 2, like in the Casino

2134
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:53,680
Night Zone, and there's, of course, the labyrinth type thing.

2135
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:58,800
And then there's also the magnetic orbs that you can use to move upwards and pick up shields

2136
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,920
and rings and lives and fun stuff.

2137
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:08,320
It does not have a save slot in it, unless you combine it with Sonic 3, to make it Sonic

2138
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,120
3 and Knuckles.

2139
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:17,040
So as far as other stuff in it, again, with Sonic 3, you can use Sonic 3 to play through

2140
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,720
as Knuckles, lots of fun.

2141
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:24,520
In Sonic 2, you can play Knuckles in Sonic 2, and you don't have to have as many rings

2142
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:32,960
for the little bonus zones, and you can also, if I remember right, I think Knuckles has

2143
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:39,000
a lower ring, no, he can carry his rings over to the next stage instead of having to start

2144
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
over.

2145
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,640
So, that was a big thing with that, it was much easier to play through it with Knuckles.

2146
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:48,320
God, I'm getting motion sickness just watching this bonus stage.

2147
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:54,560
I know, I hate, I could not do the bonus stages because I would get very motion sick.

2148
01:47:54,560 --> 01:48:05,200
And speaking of those little bonus stages, if you tried to hook up the Sonic and Knuckles

2149
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:10,360
to Sonic the Hedgehog, you would get a screen with all the cast going, no way, no way, no

2150
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,360
way!

2151
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:18,720
However, if you press a series of buttons, you can play the Blue Sphere game, a hundred

2152
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:21,600
different levels of it, and there's actually different levels depending on which game you

2153
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,820
do this with, because you can also do it with a bunch of other games.

2154
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:30,320
But keep in mind, you will not be able to play Knuckles in, you know, Violent Commando

2155
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,320
or something like that.

2156
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,720
That just wouldn't work.

2157
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,120
He'd fly everywhere and...

2158
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,640
That would be kind of awesome though.

2159
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:36,640
That would be kind of awesome.

2160
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:42,340
Wasn't it, they weren't able to do it in Sonic 1 because Sonic's blue is also coded to like

2161
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:48,320
the sky or something like that, and like, if you, you know, they change the color on

2162
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:54,080
Sonic from blue to red, but then it's BLOOD SKY!

2163
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,200
It's funny that you say that.

2164
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:01,120
There's talking about hacks, um, there was a game hack called Miles Tails Prower, which

2165
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:08,320
was, you know, Tails' name is Miles Prower, which I thought was always cute, um, and then

2166
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:13,920
they did, um, the same group did one, it was a game basically to put Miles, to put Tails

2167
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:14,920
in Sonic the Hedgehog.

2168
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:18,960
They also did Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog.

2169
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:24,840
So instead of using, um, changing the palettes, because you're right, it did change the sky

2170
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:33,360
color, they actually lifted, um, different colors of red from, um, another part in the

2171
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:39,320
game and changed the socks to blue so that he didn't have to change the palette.

2172
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,520
So that was pretty smart of them.

2173
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:48,040
Another thing, too, about Sonic 2 with Knuckles is that, um, for the longest time, um, because

2174
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:54,320
of that patch that they used to make the games work together, you couldn't find a ROM of,

2175
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:59,040
uh, of Sonic 2 that you could play Knuckles in for the longest time.

2176
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:02,320
They've since gotten around that.

2177
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:10,680
So as far as, um, the releases, what was really great, and I remember this, because I was

2178
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:17,480
like, ah, I want to do this, ah, um, Blockbuster Video and MTV had a tournament at, um, where

2179
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,160
people could play pre-release with the final one being at Alcatraz.

2180
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:27,320
I don't know if anyone else remembers that, but it was, um, called MTV's Rock the Rock

2181
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:28,320
Warning.

2182
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,320
Sadly, I think I do remember that.

2183
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:41,320
Um, it came out on Virtual Console, and it got a 9 from IGN, and it was very cool.

2184
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:44,200
Alright, your classic game of the week, folks!

2185
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,480
Sonic and Knuckles.

2186
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,440
I can't do this damn stage at all.

2187
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:50,480
Your bonus stages are evil.

2188
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,280
I prefer, oh, is he finally getting the Chaos Emerald?

2189
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,280
Yes.

2190
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,280
Yay!

2191
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,280
You got a Chaos Emerald.

2192
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,280
Alright.

2193
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,320
There it is, your classic game of the week.

2194
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,320
Enjoy that.

2195
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:04,320
It's been a long time in the works.

2196
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,840
Sonic and Knuckles there on the Sega Genesis or the Mega Drive, whichever you prefer.

2197
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,200
What a good ending spot, too.

2198
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,120
That was a good ending spot.

2199
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:17,160
Well, that was as good of a transition as Sega has plugs for his Umlaud tonight, so.

2200
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,600
Which is all available at umlaud.org, by the way.

2201
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,600
See what I mean?

2202
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:26,400
Alright, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere,

2203
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,600
because when we come back, there will be plenty more.

2204
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,040
We've got a lot, a lot of news to get through.

2205
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:33,760
We're going to ask Sega a little more about charity-related things as well, kind of like

2206
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,960
how he started this whole charity thing in the first place.

2207
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,520
We want to kind of get into that, especially for those of you out there that might be thinking,

2208
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:43,600
hmm, I want to do a fundraiser, too, and go on radio show podcasts and work in plugs everywhere

2209
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,600
I can.

2210
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,600
And be a mild internet celebrity.

2211
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,600
There you go.

2212
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:50,720
So, on the internet D-list.

2213
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:56,280
Not even the celebrity D-list, and then there's the internet D-list.

2214
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:04,960
So like, you know, keyboard cat would be like on the B-list, O-L-R, like D-minus.

2215
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,760
That means we can hang out with Kathy Griffin.

2216
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,400
No, she's on the celebrity D-list.

2217
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:13,920
We would get to hang out with, let's see, who would be on about the level of O-L-R.

2218
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:19,320
I'm trying to think of like internet celebrities that would be on about our level.

2219
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:27,920
I'm thinking, um, see even people like, even like the kid in David Goes to the Dentist,

2220
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,600
that's like, that's like at the B-list or maybe even the A-list of the internet.

2221
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:35,160
Could we hang out with a sassy gay friend?

2222
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,220
Sassy gay friends probably up there, too.

2223
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:41,000
Maybe the what, what, and the butt guy, because that's been a few years.

2224
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,600
We might be on about that level, because it's been a few years since he was popular, so.

2225
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,600
Okay.

2226
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,600
All right.

2227
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:54,880
Rob, we're probably up there with double rainbow guy, because he's kind of.

2228
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,880
What does it mean?

2229
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,880
All right.

2230
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,520
Anyhow, all joking aside, I wanted to kind of read this real quick, because this is a

2231
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,080
comment in our chat room from, and it relates to a story that we had just brought up a minute

2232
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,080
ago.

2233
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,880
This is a comment in our chat room from our pal Derek H, who is one of the hosts, or I

2234
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:13,240
should say really the host, because he always has co-hosts with him, on Dead Pixel Live.

2235
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:17,120
He's there weekdays at All Games Radio, he hosts his own little shindig there.

2236
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,120
It's a lot of fun.

2237
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:25,160
He sends us this link to a story on Slashdot about, is Zynga trying to patent virtual currency?

2238
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:28,920
Since we were talking about Zynga, and how some of their ethics may be questionable once

2239
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,400
in a while, I thought this was kind of fascinating.

2240
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:37,400
Apparently a recent patent application was spotted by Zynga, attempting to patent virtual

2241
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:42,800
currency purchased with real money for use in a gambling context.

2242
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,080
But I'm thinking, and this website's thinking as well, aren't there already plenty of

2243
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:53,720
ways that that exists, like, I don't know, Xbox 360 money, or, I mean, just a lot of

2244
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:55,040
MMOs out there.

2245
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,480
You can buy money.

2246
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:02,140
But if they get the patent, then they have the patent, but if they get it denied because

2247
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:07,160
of prior art or whatever ruling, then they can say, if someone else tries to claim it,

2248
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:14,440
they'll go, oh, no, no, no, no, we did, and the patent office said, oh, it can't be patented.

2249
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:17,160
So maybe it's a move to protect themselves in the long run?

2250
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:18,160
Yeah.

2251
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:21,160
What do you think filing all these patents and all this news is for?

2252
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:22,160
Interesting.

2253
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:23,160
All right.

2254
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:24,160
Fair enough.

2255
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:25,160
Fair enough.

2256
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,120
So we'll see what happens with that, because heaven forbid they should be granted the patent.

2257
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:29,920
But we'll see.

2258
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:30,920
All right.

2259
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,120
Anyhow, we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2260
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,120
Don't go anywhere, guys.

2261
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,120
Stay tuned.

2262
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:42,800
We'll be back right after this.

2263
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,320
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2264
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:52,800
We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 24th of 2010, for the 387th episode of

2265
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,680
our Lil Podcast here.

2266
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,680
OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2267
01:54:55,680 --> 01:55:00,080
Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at AllGames.com, where you just heard during

2268
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,840
the break there, if you were listening live, we can't put it on the podcast because it's

2269
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:03,840
copyright music.

2270
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,520
We played some music from DJ Hero 2.

2271
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,900
It kind of had the whole thing going live here in studio, that was pretty awesome.

2272
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:15,040
Also live in studio tonight, joining us, The Segg is one of the co-founders of UMLOUD,

2273
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,320
but he really hasn't talked a lot about it tonight.

2274
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:21,640
And I've been coaxing him like, hey, if you show up to the show, you've got to try and

2275
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:23,600
drop a plug or two for what you're trying to sell.

2276
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:27,760
It's hard to get people to go to umloud.org and read all about our charity.

2277
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:28,760
Yes.

2278
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,760
All right.

2279
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,720
So just try to work in a couple more plugs if you could.

2280
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:35,360
You know, Segg, I just would hate for you to have wasted that tank of gas to get here

2281
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,400
and then just not talk about your charity event.

2282
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:40,200
I know, exactly.

2283
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:43,720
It's really hard trying to get people even to follow our Twitter account, which is at

2284
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,720
UMLOUD.

2285
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:45,720
U-M-L-O-U-D.

2286
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:46,720
All right.

2287
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:47,720
Good job.

2288
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,720
All right.

2289
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:49,720
Let's see.

2290
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:52,160
Quickly, I want to ask you some more questions here since we have you here tonight.

2291
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,520
You're so kind to be here live.

2292
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,720
I know one thing you've also been doing a lot of this year, besides the telltale stuff,

2293
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:01,500
besides the UMLOUD planning, another thing you've been doing quite a bit is you've been

2294
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,100
doing speaking events.

2295
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:06,800
And I know you did PAX East because I saw your panel there when I went to PAX East earlier

2296
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:07,800
this year.

2297
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:08,800
And I know you did.

2298
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,800
Didn't you do a companion piece at PAX West?

2299
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:10,800
Yeah.

2300
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,280
Kind of same song, different verse type of deal.

2301
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:13,800
Same song, different time.

2302
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:14,800
Yeah.

2303
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,800
Different audience.

2304
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,720
What was the panel all about that you were doing?

2305
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:26,240
Well, it was trying to communicate, okay, there's a lot of people who obviously give

2306
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:33,200
to Child's Play and there's definitely a lot of people who want to do more.

2307
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:42,280
And what I wanted to do with the panels is to establish and get the right general questions

2308
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:47,320
answered for people who want to start their own Child's Play community fundraiser.

2309
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:51,680
And what that means and just sort of the broad overview of where to get started and to take

2310
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:58,640
that next step of starting your own event, whether it's a local event or an internet

2311
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,640
based event.

2312
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:04,840
Obviously, we could probably have you recap everything, but that would take an hour, like

2313
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:05,840
your panel.

2314
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,040
So I don't want to recap the whole thing.

2315
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:12,800
But just trying to get some of the points out, what would you say for somebody who is

2316
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,280
trying to plan one of these events for themselves?

2317
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,880
And maybe you can speak from experience on this.

2318
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:24,240
What's one thing that people don't anticipate when they say, hey, I want to throw a rock

2319
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:29,680
band charity event at this, I don't know, the Masonic Lodge or wherever people are doing

2320
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:31,800
things, you know, we want to do like a little charity event.

2321
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:35,840
And what do you think is like one of the top things people don't foresee in the planning

2322
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,640
of these events that comes back to surprise them?

2323
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,960
Like oops, we should have thought about X.

2324
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:47,720
Well, besides the legal thing, which is a whole other conversation, we'll touch on a

2325
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:58,680
few moments, but the big thing that I stress is set up what I call a list of products,

2326
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:04,840
if you're doing an event where, okay, these are the things that we're going to have as

2327
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:07,400
a quote unquote product for the event.

2328
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:11,960
So to take Ooma out, for example, we have this ultimate band package product, we have

2329
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:17,480
this headliner band product, we have the ticket in the door product, we have the raffle ticket

2330
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:18,480
product.

2331
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:23,800
And by listing these down, you go, okay, how do we make this happen?

2332
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:29,320
And that's what's really sort of lost because people don't really know how to take the thing

2333
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,320
from soup to nuts.

2334
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,560
It may be a great idea, but you're actually at the event and you go, oh crap, how do I

2335
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:36,560
do this?

2336
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,560
Oh crap.

2337
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,960
Oh, we have to do all this stuff and then fumble from there.

2338
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:49,000
So it's really take a step back with your team and go, start brainstorming, get all

2339
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:54,360
the ideas in the world, but then realize that it may be best to put some things off the

2340
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:59,720
table if you can't deliver on them because if you do too much and not account for it,

2341
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:02,040
it's all going to go to shambles.

2342
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:10,080
It's best to just hold back and make sure you establish yourself and maybe next year

2343
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,360
you'll do that thing that you wanted to do or whatever.

2344
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,360
All right.

2345
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,360
Awesome.

2346
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:15,360
Let's see.

2347
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:16,360
I'm trying to think of other things.

2348
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:21,800
Do you think sometimes people maybe think too big when it comes to these things?

2349
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:23,160
I would say, yeah.

2350
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:27,360
And as people who have the best of intentions and I'm not, believe me, I'm not discouraging

2351
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,880
it as someone who did a show in eight weeks.

2352
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:37,840
Well, first of all, for UmLoud, UmLoud wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Fundrauser,

2353
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:43,760
which was an event that was actually founded by Joel Johnson, started in New York and then

2354
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:51,680
grew to Denver with Brian Casante of Kotaku doing the Denver event and then Gizmodo did

2355
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:59,960
the San Francisco event and I went to that event, showed up and it was at Shine Bar on

2356
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:06,040
Leet Mission Street in San Francisco, 1337 Mission Street, and it was a 200 capacity

2357
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:13,040
bar and it was just show up with rock band, you know, very simple, but packed the place.

2358
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:17,360
And that established, okay, there is, we can get enough people in here and that was just

2359
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:20,480
with day of advertising.

2360
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:25,920
And I always, I hadn't done charity work for a while and I wanted to get back into the

2361
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,680
swing of it.

2362
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:35,400
And separately, I always wanted to do an event that incorporated rock band, guitar hero rock

2363
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:39,320
band, but focused on the performance aspect.

2364
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:45,920
And it was just this perfect storm, so I threw my hat in and that's when I first got introduced

2365
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:52,120
to Chris Kohler, who also helped out with the Fundrauser event in 08.

2366
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:56,940
And it was also, you know, planning this out, actually throughout the year, but with Joel

2367
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:05,840
and Joel had a lot of things going on so he can continue on and so we were left with making

2368
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:11,920
our own event since we already had the deposit reserve for DNA and got things together.

2369
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:17,880
And it really, it also, don't do this alone, I think is the other thing.

2370
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:24,280
If you, you know, if you can't get other people to do it, don't break yourself.

2371
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:29,720
And I'm not trying to discourage people, I'm not trying to knock them down.

2372
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:33,400
Even if you're a big control freak like me and like you just, you want to do everything,

2373
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,200
like you just have to let some of it go because it's too much for one person.

2374
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:41,760
It goes down to if you can't get people to help you quite yet in working the event, how

2375
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,320
are you going to get people there?

2376
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:45,000
That's a fair question.

2377
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,820
You know, it's a fair question.

2378
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:53,360
I would say be realistic, but don't that outright discourage you.

2379
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,360
Right.

2380
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,920
Don't let any of this scare you off from trying to do something like that.

2381
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,040
I think that's important too.

2382
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:01,720
Like we're just, we're just trying to be real here on OLR and say, you know, if you're ready

2383
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:07,080
to take this dive, by all means dive, but here's some floaties, some tips so that you

2384
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:08,080
don't drown.

2385
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:11,680
So let me get you a question from our chat room if I could here at chat.orangetonstrategy.com.

2386
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:15,920
Salacious Pop is in chat and wants to know, Segg, how long did it take to get incorporated

2387
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:22,320
as a nonprofit so that people could legally write off donations to you in their taxes?

2388
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,320
Are the fees steep?

2389
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:27,400
Did you have to do it through an attorney to protect your own name and assets?

2390
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:36,880
I have the benefit of a wonderful father who does this pretty professionally.

2391
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:43,560
I say that just like he doesn't actually have it as a job job, but he, we, as I, as I alluded

2392
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:48,880
to the sort of the family business that wasn't really a business was charity events back

2393
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:59,240
home in Detroit, Dearborn, and like we did Detroit Children's Hospital Festival of Trees

2394
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,800
and our high school auction and all that.

2395
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:08,360
So he already knows how to, you know, the tax end of things.

2396
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:13,320
The state of California was definitely new to us and, oh, the state of California was

2397
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:22,360
definitely new to us for those filings, but it's sort of a level thing.

2398
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:28,440
We were, the official birth date as far as the IRS and the state of California's concern

2399
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:37,200
for UMLoud is November 17th, and that was when the California you are a business that

2400
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:42,240
happens to be nonprofit was first minted, which is pretty quick.

2401
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:47,720
But then for all the stuff you want to do, like donation buttons, either PayPal or Google

2402
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:53,480
checkout and all that, yes, you know, and we got the TIN very easily, the tax ID number

2403
02:03:53,480 --> 02:04:01,100
for UMLoud, but then you have all this other stuff that has to go through, like it takes

2404
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:07,160
a while for the IRS to process the paperwork and you have to fill out the longer form and

2405
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,160
all this.

2406
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:13,960
So really things did not get settled, settled, settled as far as establishing and getting

2407
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:22,200
our determination letter from the IRS till like February, but it's sort of the, yes,

2408
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:26,680
you were okay as long as you fill out your paperwork, but as of November 17th for us,

2409
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,680
we were still in the clear.

2410
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:30,680
You mean the government is slow in processing paperwork, you don't say.

2411
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:36,000
Well, the IRS even outwardly says, yes, we're going to take a while and you are okay to

2412
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,920
work as a nonprofit, but put your paperwork in and know that, you know, we could revoke

2413
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:45,640
the status because something didn't clear, which they didn't, you know, we had our, everything

2414
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:47,160
was up to snuff.

2415
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:50,880
Just to back you up in our chat room, Defective Candy is in our chat at chat.ornsontradi.com

2416
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:55,220
and says, from experience, the state of Michigan is way easier to do the nonprofit than a place

2417
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:56,220
like Cali.

2418
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:03,520
Yeah, California actually, from what I've been told by others, is the most complicated

2419
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:04,520
in the union.

2420
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:09,760
I should also state that every state has a different way completely.

2421
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:16,960
I mean, the IRS is obviously consistent within the U.S., outside of the U.S., I don't know.

2422
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:17,960
Sorry.

2423
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,960
Go ahead.

2424
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,960
Oh, okay.

2425
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:24,560
But, you know, that's, when I do these panels, I guide people to the general questions that

2426
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:31,560
they have to ask themselves, which is basically start by googling up your, whatever entity

2427
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:38,240
in your state does business entities, secretary of state usually, but not always, sometimes

2428
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:41,800
they have a separate department and all that, and that will start you down on the road of

2429
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:42,800
what you need to do.

2430
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,440
But don't let all this stuff freak you out either.

2431
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:49,800
Now, I should also say that, like, there's sort of two general avenues of, at least for

2432
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:52,200
child's play, community fundraisers.

2433
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:57,760
There's the actual local physical event, which is what we do, and then there's the internet-based

2434
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,760
fundraisers.

2435
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:03,840
Now, the internet-based ones, they haven't made, as long as they're not stupid, and that,

2436
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:10,920
because, like, for example, Desert Bus, which is the online telethon for them, they point,

2437
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:17,320
they use chip-in to point directly to the child's play PayPal account, meaning they

2438
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:20,760
never touch the money, ever, period.

2439
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:26,120
The chip-in tracks the metrics of how much people clicking on their button went to child's

2440
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:31,600
play, but they never touch the money, so they don't have to do any of this.

2441
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:35,680
We touch the money at UMA because we have to, you know, pay for the venue, and we're

2442
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:42,640
taking in donations ourselves in this physical event, so we have to go through the process.

2443
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:50,760
The big numbers, at least for the IRS, at the IRS level, is if you get more than $250

2444
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:58,960
from any one individual, or your total take is $5,000, you need a file, you know, you've

2445
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:02,560
graduated up to, nope, you need to do it for reals.

2446
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,840
There's a great follow-up from Defective Candy here in our chat room saying, there are some

2447
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:06,880
great books on the matter.

2448
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:11,320
I like Nolo's How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation, and all states have info on how to do them

2449
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:12,920
on their official website.

2450
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:14,960
You might have to do a tiny bit of digging.

2451
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,200
Let me throw this out there, too, one more kind of little thing here, because I know

2452
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,880
this is one of the things I took away from the panel.

2453
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,320
I was like, oh yeah, that's something I might not think about otherwise.

2454
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:28,800
But say, if somebody wants to do a child's play fundraiser, you know, before just throwing

2455
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:32,320
the name out there like, hey, we're going to do this child's play fundraiser, there's

2456
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,840
probably people they should be getting in touch with, right?

2457
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:40,760
Yeah, the, Kristin Lindsey is, I'm sorry, Kristin, I'm totally forgetting your new title

2458
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,680
position, the official title, but she's the woman in charge of child's play.

2459
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,560
We won't call her goddess of child's play.

2460
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:50,280
Yeah, goddess of child's play.

2461
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:52,280
She has an official title, and I apologize for that.

2462
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:54,560
It's okay, it's live radio, you're on the spot.

2463
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:59,680
But it's sort of, child's play's not going to give you too much help, because let's face

2464
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,040
it, it's a...

2465
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:03,040
They're not going to run the event for you.

2466
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,280
They're not going to run the event for you.

2467
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:09,860
It's good to check in with her, you know, and sending an email to her saying, hey, we're

2468
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:18,920
doing this event, and she'll give some help, but you have to understand that everyone else

2469
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:25,720
is doing all this stuff, especially around this time when the season's ramping up again.

2470
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:29,840
And the process of giving them money is, if you're doing the chip-in thing, the internet-based

2471
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:33,960
thing, well, you don't have to do anything, it's already into their PayPal account.

2472
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:40,500
But for us, it's, we mail a checkout made out to child's play charity, and mail it in

2473
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:47,340
to the mailing address that's on the child's play website, and there's that.

2474
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:50,600
But it's just good, and it's one of those things that you might think is obvious, but

2475
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:54,400
I don't think everyone really thinks of this, is that if you're going to do a charity fundraiser,

2476
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:56,720
go ahead and contact the charity.

2477
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:57,720
They like to know these things.

2478
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:58,720
Yeah.

2479
02:08:58,720 --> 02:08:59,720
Yeah.

2480
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:03,920
And you never know, you might get a plug on the website or something, or a tips at least,

2481
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:08,120
things maybe you haven't thought of before, so, you know, things that other people have

2482
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:09,120
learned.

2483
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,120
So, all right.

2484
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:14,840
Well, I don't want to spend too much more time talking about that, I don't want to ruin

2485
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:20,660
your possible panels in 2011, so I don't know if you're going to be doing it all over again,

2486
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:24,800
but it was, at least when I went and saw it at PAX East, I certainly learned a lot.

2487
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,240
I know we've kind of dabbled in the idea of maybe doing an OLR charity something something

2488
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:31,720
at some point, so it was interesting to hear all that, so good deal.

2489
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:35,280
All right, well anyway, we're going to move on with some gaming news, and Seg of course

2490
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,040
is going to stay with us here to talk a little more about the gaming news and Dish with us

2491
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,040
this week.

2492
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,760
We'll first do some rapid news, then we're going to get into the Twitter topics, so quick,

2493
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:46,440
some rapid, rapid news, Loki.

2494
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:50,680
Yes, Interplay has announced that Fallout Online will be coming out in the second half

2495
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:56,960
of 2012, and it's interesting, there's been a little bit of back and forth between Interplay

2496
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,760
and Bethesda over the rights for Fallout and stuff, and I believe at one point Interplay

2497
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:07,080
was demanding $50 million for Fallout, and apparently Bethesda said no.

2498
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:13,920
So it'll be interesting to see, and I'm sure that a Fallout MMO will be pretty interesting,

2499
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,360
but we'll have to wait a couple years for that.

2500
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:24,040
The ESRB is rated Twisted Metal for the PlayStation 1 classics, so obviously they'll be coming

2501
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:28,220
around pretty soon, maybe they'll tie in a little bit with the new Twisted Metal game

2502
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:34,080
maybe coming out next year, so we'll have to wait for that one, but at least you can

2503
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:35,560
expect that.

2504
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:40,360
And then a racing game that is on the PlayStation 3 right now, ModNation Racers, is going to

2505
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:48,120
be getting a Stunt Pack free, I guess it's going to have some cool ramps and whatnot.

2506
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:54,520
The Stunt Pack will include a double-decker bus, an interactive truck, an interactive

2507
02:10:54,520 --> 02:11:02,000
truck trailer mini-ramp, as well as some wide stunt ramps, thin stunt ramps, thin rails,

2508
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,200
tilling platform, framing, skull ring, all sorts of cool stuff.

2509
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:10,480
And that is free for two weeks, that's beginning October 26th, so if you do have that game,

2510
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:14,600
or if you're thinking about picking up that game, you might want to download that.

2511
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,600
Hurry hurry!

2512
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:21,440
Alright, I've got some quick stuff for you guys too, one of them is about Xbox Live.

2513
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:27,680
The Xbox Live Silver account is no more, it is gone, it is out of here, but don't worry,

2514
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,820
you didn't all get suddenly upgraded to gold, actually I don't think that's something anyone

2515
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:31,820
would worry about.

2516
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:34,640
No, here's what really happened, the Xbox Live Silver memberships are now just called

2517
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:37,120
Xbox Live Free Membership.

2518
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:38,120
It is what it is.

2519
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,640
Yeah, finally.

2520
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:40,640
So there it is.

2521
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:46,240
And that is launched right along with the Xbox.com remake that went live this week,

2522
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:49,720
so they just basically say it's free.

2523
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:54,400
They're saying the features did not change, the name for the paid membership did not change,

2524
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,240
just this little component of it.

2525
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:57,240
Just so you know.

2526
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:58,240
It's easier branding.

2527
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,240
I think so.

2528
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,240
Yeah.

2529
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:05,920
Plus, I think especially when one of PlayStation's big things is selling like the free PlayStation

2530
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:07,760
network, I think for them to be able to say...

2531
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,760
Not quite anymore, but...

2532
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,760
Yeah, exactly.

2533
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,880
You know, now they're kind of on par there, so it works out.

2534
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:17,560
Tron Evolution is getting some voice acting from the movie, which is pretty cool.

2535
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:22,620
Olivia Wilde, who plays Korra in the upcoming Tron Legacy movie, is going to be doing some

2536
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:24,360
voices in Tron Evolution.

2537
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:25,360
That's pretty cool.

2538
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:29,400
Also, the voice of the original Tron character, Bruce Boxleitner, is going to be in there,

2539
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:30,760
so that's pretty awesome.

2540
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:32,840
From the scarecrow, Mrs. King.

2541
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:38,040
Sadly, not all of the actors are in there, like I don't see that, what's his name, Garrett,

2542
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:41,080
whatever that's playing the main character, and Jeff Bridges I don't see in the list,

2543
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:44,000
but just about everybody else seems to be in there, which is pretty cool.

2544
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Jensen Ackles.

2545
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,280
That makes me personally happy, because I have a major, major, major thing.

2546
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:53,920
And seeing as I believe I heard the game is kind of set in between the two movies, they

2547
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:59,600
probably did something with the story where they didn't necessarily need the A-list actors.

2548
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:04,320
NBA Jam, as we've talked about for a couple weeks on this show, is getting spun off into

2549
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:08,400
its PS3 and 360 retail releases.

2550
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:15,760
The game is going to be $49.99, and it's coming out November 17th.

2551
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:21,360
Also, it should be noted that it is going to be online and all that, but not on the

2552
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,440
Wii.

2553
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,600
That version is already out.

2554
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:27,440
Online will be available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

2555
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,400
There's going to be two-on-two online.

2556
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:34,160
There's going to be a title update in December that will have a remix jam party for up to

2557
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:40,080
four players and all sorts of that fun stuff, so $49.99 if you want to check out NBA Jam

2558
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,240
on the 360 or the PS3.

2559
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:44,360
He's on fire!

2560
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:45,360
Boom shakalaka!

2561
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,760
Boom shakalaka!

2562
02:13:47,760 --> 02:14:04,400
In other news, for fans who really like the music in Castlevania Symphony of the Night...
