00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:26,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 24th, 2010, two Capcom worlds collide in an upcoming 3DS game, fans of Sonic the Hedgehog up the ante in a new HD version, and in one country, Grand Theft Auto 4 is ordered off the shelves.

2
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:42,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that radio video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:46,455
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

5
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:50,196
[SPEAKER_04]: www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

6
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:54,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining you over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.

7
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:57,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:58,285 --> 00:00:58,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Storms, LOL

9
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:22,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is so dried out from a long summer that it just screws everything up.

10
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:54,672
[SPEAKER_05]: and the oil floats all up to the top of the streets and it becomes a big slick and no one knows how to drive in the rain.

11
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:59,395
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been raining for almost, it feels like a day straight.

12
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It rained yesterday almost all day.

13
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

14
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:03,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I've enjoyed it.

15
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:03,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the rain.

16
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:04,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been sick.

17
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like rain when I'm sick because then it makes all the warm food I'm eating so much better.

18
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:09,828
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:35,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, say hello, of course, to Tech Master Loki, also joining us tonight, as he always does.

20
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:36,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

21
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And complete with what?

22
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:39,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we on quadruple bacon pizza now?

23
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

24
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:45,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to scare them with the thought of putting four times the amount of bacon on a pizza.

25
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:46,517
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd have to make you sign a medical disclaimer.

26
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:47,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd eat them into that, you know.

27
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,138
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

28
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:51,679
[SPEAKER_04]: How have things been for you?

29
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,439
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the baby doing?

30
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby is fine.

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,502
[SPEAKER_02]: He was with mom going to her parents' house.

32
00:02:59,403 --> 00:02:59,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's that?

33
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:00,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that in the bay?

34
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:01,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Folsom.

35
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:01,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

36
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:02,565
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that bad.

37
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:03,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he pooping fine?

38
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's pooping just fine.

39
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

40
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember the poop scare.

41
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Inquiring minds want to know.

42
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:09,749
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

43
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining us in studio tonight.

44
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, in studio, not on Skype.

45
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:17,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We love having guests actually come down to the studio and hang with us.

46
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to our pal, The Seg.

47
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:20,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The Seg.

48
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR!

49
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:23,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful to be here.

50
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful to have you.

51
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for coming out here.

52
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:34,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really had a chance to say it to you before we've gone live because it's just been go, go, go, go, because I was running in the door late tonight.

53
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did get a new mic cord for Dark Sakura, so it wasn't all for naught.

54
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:38,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So just saying.

55
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it works tonight.

56
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not having to hold it in.

57
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:43,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what she said.

58
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:44,503
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

59
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:53,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but Seg, you drove all the way here from the Bay Area, which is a good... Well, usually it's probably about an hour and a half, but I'm going to guess because of the rain, it probably took like two and a half hours.

60
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,106
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was exactly an hour and a half.

61
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:55,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

62
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,226
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I am from Detroit, so I actually know how to drive.

63
00:03:58,927 --> 00:03:59,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

64
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:11,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ford family here, so... Well, regardless, no matter how long it took you to get here, it is quite a bit of a tank of gas, so I do really appreciate you coming out and hanging here in studio with us.

65
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:14,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Not quite as glamorous as it sounds on the radio, huh?

66
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:15,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know...

67
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,450
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to pull back the curtain for everyone out there on the internets.

68
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's all right.

69
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

70
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I meant, of course, our microphones are all gold-plated.

71
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:27,658
[SPEAKER_04]: This couch is absolutely wonderful.

72
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me more grapes, servants.

73
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,220
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

74
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Sag, you are here, though.

75
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you have ulterior motives for being here tonight.

76
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:36,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we mind.

77
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate a reason to have you here in-house.

78
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,050
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're here to promote a little something-something that's going on, right?

79
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just...

80
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little something.

81
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might have heard of it because, you know, gosh, we've only mentioned it on the show about 50 gazillion times.

82
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:53,254
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay because it's a charity thing and we'll say it a gazillion more times for charity.

83
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,434
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up?

84
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,515
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the big event that you are co-hosting?

85
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Umlaut, a rock band night for child's play charity.

86
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a performance-based rock band night, and I really stress it as performance.

87
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a competition.

88
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:12,366
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't give a care about your score whatsoever.

89
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:15,947
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about rocking out for child's play charity.

90
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:24,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no one, as the old saying on the internet goes, no one cur if you have a crappy score on a song or what have you.

91
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:27,977
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get the most props if you're really into it.

92
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the outfits and stuff.

93
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the stuff I saw last year, outstanding.

94
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,703
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lego Rock Band people were great.

95
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:39,027
[SPEAKER_04]: There was lots of dress-ups, bands, good times.

96
00:05:39,827 --> 00:06:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started it last year under the wake of Fundrauser which went away but it was Chris Kohler of Wired.com game life blog Joe Marquette of Game Helper and myself and we put on San Francisco's Child's Play charity event community fundraiser for Child's Play and last year we did it

97
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:11,085
[SPEAKER_03]: all soup to nuts within eight weeks.

98
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:17,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also incorporated as our own nonprofit to be all nice and legal.

99
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:23,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I should talk about the band packages because that's really where we're leading into.

100
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, why not?

101
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:25,652
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all over the map, but that's okay.

102
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We're everywhere.

103
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's a three-hour show.

104
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:30,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We can never stay on one track.

105
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:30,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's fine.

106
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Take all the time you need.

107
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not... We don't do the just go up and play at a bar.

108
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you go to a bar or anything...

109
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:40,453
[SPEAKER_03]: to play rock band.

110
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:44,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually one screen and everyone is looking at the screen.

111
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:51,896
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do is have the performers turn around and face the audience and perform out to the audience.

112
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:58,558
[SPEAKER_03]: There's monitors on the stage floor, but they look like speaker monitors to the audience because it's next to the speaker monitors.

113
00:06:59,418 --> 00:06:59,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And

114
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,488
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

115
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:20,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have one song that they pick that no one else will play on their main stage.

116
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:25,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, if I claim a song, and I say, like, Gaga is mine tonight.

117
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:26,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me.

118
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:27,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Gaga.

119
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Then nobody else can pick that same Gaga song.

120
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,289
[SPEAKER_03]: First come, first serve.

121
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yes, once it's locked in, it's yours.

122
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:37,131
[SPEAKER_03]: No one else will play it on the main stage.

123
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that really sucks at, like, karaoke sometimes, and you've got, like, four people in a row, you know?

124
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we belong together now

125
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh god, shut up.

126
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:51,036
[SPEAKER_04]: They all get progressively worse.

127
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:53,317
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 2,000 songs in Rock Band.

128
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be hard to duplicate.

129
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that even counting the network stuff?

130
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their 2,000 count counts the network stuff.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, that's a lot.

132
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:09,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is that we don't know what's going to happen with these bands when they show up, especially last year.

133
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,444
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know if people were going to get it.

134
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:17,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we didn't know if people were just going to like, oh, I'm playing rock band or like, no, this is my rock concert.

135
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were people that got it.

136
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:27,936
[SPEAKER_03]: The one band that to me really got it was Ironhead.

137
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:31,378
[SPEAKER_03]: as in the Brutal Legend game.

138
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:33,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I remember that.

139
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,420
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pictures of that girl all over the internet.

140
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I should plug the website.

141
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:52,349
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to umloud.org, now that's U-M-L-O-U-D, umloud.org, and you'll see the little flicker button there too, and that will give you all the pictures, and you'll see Ophelia there.

142
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,310
[SPEAKER_03]: She's pretty hard to miss because she...

143
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, spent a couple of hours before, you know, that day being dressed up in blue makeup, head to toe.

144
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:06,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I didn't know that they, I mean, I knew they were named Ironhead.

145
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:12,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew they were doing, uh, uh, um, I'm totally blanking on the song name.

146
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever song they did, yeah.

147
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Hellion Electric Eye.

148
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:22,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they hit the stage, you know, I saw her there dressed up and like, oh, that's one of my bands.

149
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:23,016
Yeah.

150
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:28,278
[SPEAKER_03]: and then when they performed it was absolutely amazing.

151
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:29,358
[SPEAKER_03]: They got it.

152
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And this year we hope to have more that get it.

153
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,022
[SPEAKER_04]: The ante is being upped now that people are seeing the pictures from last year.

154
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:42,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, how can we just even take it a step further?

155
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,344
[SPEAKER_04]: You know there's going to be people that are like, we gotta outdo.

156
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to facilitate that at Oomloud.

157
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why we're doing something additional to the event.

158
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:52,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the

159
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,472
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ultimate Band Package.

160
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the band package that we did last year and then we're still doing.

161
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:00,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Those go on sale November 1st.

162
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:08,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But we decided we wanted to do one really special package that we're calling the Headliner Band.

163
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:13,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And this package is, there's only one of them because it's the Headliner.

164
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:19,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's auctioned off and it's actually going on right now through eBay.

165
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get a two song set.

166
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:28,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as they don't dilly dally, they get first choice for the night to reserve those two songs.

167
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:37,485
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the headliners, so obviously they're on the flyers, they're on the posters, they're on the video that we make.

168
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:47,790
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have Area 5, which is a video production company that will be making the commercials and, assuming schedules gel well, will be...

169
00:10:48,590 --> 00:11:02,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing the video for us with the headliner band And you get your own place at DNA Lounge, which is the venue that we're in With drink and food service all provided to you So you can have people feed you grapes?

170
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:12,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes Alright, awesome I'm liking this so far And that's going on now, and that auction actually ends Thursday at 4pm-ish

171
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:24,382
[SPEAKER_03]: and we really hope we get a lot of people bidding on that thing because the donation all goes to Child's Play.

172
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to stress, this money is not going to SAG.

173
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: This money is not going to DNA Lounge.

174
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:32,066
[SPEAKER_04]: This money is going to charity.

175
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:33,787
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it, right?

176
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:41,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to Child's Play charity which provides video games, toys, and other financial support to children's hospitals around the globe.

177
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:52,240
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's kind of known as the Penny Arcade charity, but even Penny Arcade wants to stress that it's not like, oh, this is directly all Penny Arcade.

178
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,325
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to stress that this is, yes, they house the offices and the staff,

179
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:03,829
[SPEAKER_03]: for it, but... They planted the seed, but it's grown into its own thing.

180
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:12,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially with all of the community fundraisers that happen, like Goom Lab, but also Desert Bus for Hope and the Mario Marathon and all the others.

181
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:17,782
[SPEAKER_03]: These are people... Child's Play itself just is the direct servicer.

182
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,604
[SPEAKER_03]: They take the money and...

183
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:28,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Directly deal with the child's life services or equivalent of the children's hospitals in their network.

184
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get the toys there.

185
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,241
[SPEAKER_03]: They make what toys are needed and all that.

186
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:38,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's given is exactly what the hospital needs.

187
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:47,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the community fundraisers do is help in very creative, unique ways to raise money for this charity.

188
00:12:52,112 --> 00:13:00,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Every year for Child's Play has beaten its high score the previous year, including the past two years when that shouldn't have happened.

189
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:04,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Economic downturn.

190
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Child's Play was one of the very, very few charities that increased their giving.

191
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:17,827
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everything to do with these community fundraisers across the globe.

192
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:20,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have a fundraising goal set for Umlaut this year?

193
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that one of those, you know, I don't want to talk about it type of things?

194
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it kind of is.

195
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We always want to do more.

196
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:35,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just focus that energy on making the best event possible.

197
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:40,734
[SPEAKER_03]: without making much cost of how to put on the event.

198
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of partners that help us.

199
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:43,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask this.

200
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask how much we raised last year?

201
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:51,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, I wrote the check out and mailed it in for $7,000 to Child's Play.

202
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:51,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

203
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:52,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

204
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was eight weeks of putting everything together.

205
00:13:58,077 --> 00:13:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of last moment.

206
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:01,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year, we hope to improve on the situation.

207
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:08,543
[SPEAKER_04]: and also a lot... Umlaut is... Just for the record, I would have never known that it only took eight weeks to do if you hadn't told me.

208
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:10,745
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys did a really good job last year.

209
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:14,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how we did it.

210
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:16,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not just saying that because you're a friend.

211
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was a smooth operation.

212
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:21,074
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have good partners.

213
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,075
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA Lounge...

214
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:31,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Zawinski, the owner, and Barry and all of them over there are just absolutely wonderful to us.

215
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,382
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely make sure they're in the loop.

216
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely respect them as the venue.

217
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Harmonix is on this too, right?

218
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:40,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Harmonix.

219
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say, we will have

220
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:47,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Every song playable in Rock Band 3.

221
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,343
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have two stages.

222
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:09,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know I've been stressing the main stage and the performances there, which is the show in itself.

223
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of other things that we have there.

224
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We have in the lounge room, the second room, free play rock band show up.

225
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:31,130
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the donation bin out there to kind of guilt you, but it's free play, we don't care, just walk up, that's your traditional bar, rock band setting, and that's free play.

226
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year was like the Beatles room, because that was the big game last year, and this year is just kind of whatever is clever?

227
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:40,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't know what we're going to have special yet for...

228
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what we have special yet for this year, but last year we debuted before it came out the Rubber Soul album from Beatles Rock Band.

229
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:54,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the best and it's sitting in my closet right there.

230
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:56,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhere in there.

231
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:58,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, am I going to get Jamie to go with me this year?

232
00:15:58,535 --> 00:15:59,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe she can belt out a tune or two.

233
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:01,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

234
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:02,878
[SPEAKER_04]: On the beast, I will make you go on the main stage.

235
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:03,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let me ask this.

236
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:07,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to take this wheel in another direction, but this question has been kind of like lingering on my mind.

237
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm not a person that wants to get up in front of the crowd.

238
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:11,643
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

239
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:16,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to help the charity, but singing in front of people is not my thing.

240
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,329
[SPEAKER_04]: What fun things can I expect to have at Umlaut?

241
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:22,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, it's the performances.

242
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,351
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, they are performances.

243
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:29,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you search YouTube for Umlaut, you'll see what I mean.

244
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:36,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, the cell phone cameras, but you'll see the kind of performances.

245
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:43,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And that alone is worth the $10 door, but we don't stop there.

246
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:47,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have...

247
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:52,406
[SPEAKER_03]: What's been called the nerd yard sale.

248
00:16:54,007 --> 00:17:09,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And we clean out the closets of various game studios and developers and publishers and news outlets and all that to clean out all the swag they've collected for the year and just put it out on the table.

249
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you pay for the door, you pick one thing from the table.

250
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:16,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So you at least walk out with something.

251
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:43,257
[SPEAKER_03]: but in addition we're going to have a raffle and some pretty good prizes if I do say so myself we'll be announcing those a lot of right now our attention is all on the bands because we're trying to get this auction that you know finished on you know it ends Thursday and then the following Monday is when we get the ultimate band so we're kind of geared towards that and then we make the push of please show up

252
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wanted you to get that out there, that there was that going on.

253
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:53,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we do, believe it or not, there are a few friends of our show that work at various developers and things.

254
00:17:53,264 --> 00:18:12,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though I know they don't email us or talk to us all the time because they don't want to talk about their projects, if you happen to work for a developer or some type of game studio and you have some extra stuff sitting in a storage room that maybe some fans might want, Umlaut would be a great charity to kind of give those to, right?

255
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:12,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

256
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:20,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we actually are looking for sponsors, both financial as well as gifts and all that.

257
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:30,698
[SPEAKER_03]: We are our own nonprofit, so we are our own 501c3 in case people are a little weary of not giving directly to Child's Play.

258
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,140
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, yes, it's going to Child's Play.

259
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

260
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:55,793
[SPEAKER_03]: and donating to us directly is also legal in the state of California and the United States as a non-profit so please if you want to give us stuff or be a financial partner with us please please please go to umlaut.org there's that sponsor link there and we would love to talk to you

261
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:57,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

262
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:22,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm trying to think what else to kind of get out here before we move on with the show.

263
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask you more maybe later on the show, Part B, kind of about what goes into the actual planning of the event.

264
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the event itself, anything else we need to know about what's coming up December 9th?

265
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:34,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Thursday, December 9th.

266
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:36,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I stress the Thursday because last year was on Wednesday.

267
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We leveled up to Thursday.

268
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:44,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we get more people, we may be able to level up for weekend.

269
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really important for people to show up.

270
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:52,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're anywhere remotely near the Bay Area, please come on down.

271
00:19:53,886 --> 00:20:03,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And tickets, if tickets are on sale right now, you can click on tickets on the website if you know you're not going to be in a band, but do want to show up.

272
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really helpful for us.

273
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:11,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I should also note that if you are in a band package, you're on the guest list, you get in, you're good.

274
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,122
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have any inkling of showing up, please show up.

275
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:20,405
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not regret it.

276
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:25,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of our listeners, because, you know, we are, believe it or not, an international show.

277
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:28,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We have folks that listen to the show in Mexico, in Sweden, and all these places.

278
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:33,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just, as much as we really want them to come, they're probably not going to be able to swing it.

279
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are ways they can still participate if they're very far away, right?

280
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:36,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

281
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:40,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the donation button right on every single page at Inland.org.

282
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:41,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

283
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:46,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, if you, Child's Play uses PayPal for direct donations.

284
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,027
[SPEAKER_03]: We use Google Checkout.

285
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:59,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to stress that we're not trying to take money or have this bidding war between who donates to Child's Play and who donates to Umlaut because it's going to the same place anyways.

286
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:04,499
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you feel more comfortable with Google Checkout, the donation button's there for you.

287
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,461
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to go straight to Child's Play, awesome.

288
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ChildsPlayCharity.org.

289
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:14,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just goes such a long way.

290
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:15,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

291
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:19,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a good feeling you're going to beat that $7,000 this year.

292
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a really good feeling.

293
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:21,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I sure bloody hope so.

294
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:22,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

295
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:24,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, best of luck, Seg.

296
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you're going to be sitting in on the show tonight.

297
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:29,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So feel free to chime in on anything gaming related.

298
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'll have opinions.

299
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet you will.

300
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:38,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially there might be stories about a particular developer that might be of interest to you.

301
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:38,589
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

302
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:39,569
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

303
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't put into words what a big freaking deal that is.

304
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:10,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to put out there.

305
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:12,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everybody but me thinks I can sing.

306
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,031
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is actually a pretty good singer.

307
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:19,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we extend that maybe through the next week for our podcasties who maybe aren't listening live tonight?

308
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:20,498
[SPEAKER_05]: If we get 150 tonight.

309
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, you're throwing down.

310
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

311
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,702
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't get 150 tonight, if we get 250 by next weekend... She's throwing all these random numbers out there.

312
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,423
[SPEAKER_05]: No, seriously, because there's a method to my madness.

313
00:22:34,023 --> 00:22:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't hit 150 tonight, and they have a way of saying donate in the name of... If they go through the Umlaut donation button, I can't, I have obviously no access to the Child's Play one, but...

314
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:54,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there should be some sort of note, I think.

315
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:57,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a...

316
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,312
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure out the logistics.

317
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:19,377
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do donate, if there isn't some place to put it in, obviously, can people email... Let's have them email the receipt number.

318
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:22,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Email your receipt to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Perfect.

319
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:23,559
[SPEAKER_03]: That works.

320
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:28,377
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you can't put it on there, make sure you say For Orange Lounge Radio.

321
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:29,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

322
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:41,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you happen to buy a million copies of Eye of Judgment tonight, then... How about if we can raise... How much money can we raise to get Loki to go to the show in a Tingle outfit?

323
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:47,690
[SPEAKER_05]: How about if we can raise $1,000 by the night of the... No, I'm not going.

324
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,990
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta watch it.

325
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if we can raise $1,000, but then I'll dress as freaking Tingle shit.

326
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

327
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:56,855
[SPEAKER_04]: She said it.

328
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:57,415
[SPEAKER_04]: She said it.

329
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:58,216
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

330
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:59,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

331
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:07,800
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can raise $1,000 by the night of Unwild, I will go as a Parapara girl.

332
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Blonde wig and all.

333
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:10,801
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

334
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, regardless of how much... I'll wear some costume.

335
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:17,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of how much is raised tonight or until the night, you're at least going to go to the show, I hope.

336
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:18,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

337
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

338
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:19,170
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

339
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

340
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:19,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

341
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:20,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got school that night.

342
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut class.

343
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:23,354
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

344
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:23,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll think about it.

345
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:24,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

346
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:26,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the teacher it's for charity.

347
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,178
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

348
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:27,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow...

349
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,541
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

350
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:52,198
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did I play?

351
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:55,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Bayonetta, because she is a sexy bitch.

352
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:58,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And what else did I play?

353
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:00,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Final Fantasy XIII.

354
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:04,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to play some Star Trek Online, but I'm pissed off at the Borg right now.

355
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very pissed.

356
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:11,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if somebody knows how to pass a stupid Borg mission, let me know, because I am pissed off at it.

357
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It just says, defeat Borg, steal data.

358
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,502
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 50 of them in there!

359
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:17,622
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a viniculum!

360
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:43,213
[SPEAKER_04]: and he said, oh, that's my rogue.

361
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, that's great.

362
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:48,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So it made me think of you because it's all Star Trek nerds.

363
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:49,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

364
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:51,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Why isn't he playing Star Trek Online?

365
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:52,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably is.

366
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:53,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Must be on a Mac.

367
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:58,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

368
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I have several friends who actually can't play Star Trek Online anymore because they don't have it for Mac.

369
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:35,583
[SPEAKER_05]: hurry up, get out oh yeah, and I also played a lot of Plants vs. Zombies because I'm addicted, addicted, addicted to jackpot mode in Plants vs. Zombies and zombie bowling and I played a bunch of other stuff too I've given up on Narbacular Drop I'm done with it, given up oh, and I played some Portal

370
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:37,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

371
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:07,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really been playing that much this week.

372
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:13,725
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the only iOS game I think I've really been playing a lot of recently is... How about Unicorn Attack?

373
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:14,425
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually not that.

374
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:16,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play some last week, though, on the show.

375
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:21,509
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've been actually addicted to Cartoon Wars 2.

376
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:27,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tower defense game with stick figures, except they have heavy artillery and stuff.

377
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:28,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty awesome.

378
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,273
[SPEAKER_02]: They have everything from, like, you know...

379
00:27:31,394 --> 00:27:50,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Medieval weapons, swords, spears, bow and arrows and stuff to giant mechs and bazookas and all that fun stuff So it's pretty fun, I'm just grinding along right now And then I played a little bit of DJ Hero 2 and I'm totally digging the new songs in there

380
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:51,953
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

381
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:19,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the old 90s rap stuff that's in there is alright, but I don't know.

382
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:29,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think they need more variety in some of the songs because I can only hear so many remixes of California before I just get sick of it.

383
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:31,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Or OPP.

384
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:32,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

385
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:42,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's too bad you can't get the booty mashups or that kind of level because they have to actually get the licensing for the music.

386
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:43,765
[SPEAKER_05]: More gorillas!

387
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:44,846
[SPEAKER_05]: More gorillas!

388
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the stylo mix with itself, yeah.

389
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,085
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

390
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:14,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like kind of just playing it more relaxed instead of just trying to mash buttons like crazy in it.

391
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:19,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And even on medium, it's mashing buttons like crazy with a lot of the songs.

392
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:29,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Firestarter remix with itself, it was just insanely... It was more difficult than I anticipated for a song like that.

393
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:30,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why you chose poorly.

394
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't load the soundboard before.

395
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:58,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do they have where you can play as your home character?

396
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:02,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, Sony's really innovative with all their home features, right?

397
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:03,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really asking that?

398
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, really?

399
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sony.

400
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play it with my me.

401
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me answer that with a sound.

402
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Delayed radio, boys and girls, thank you.

403
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I used the toilet today during the other podcast.

404
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:20,478
[SPEAKER_04]: During that other show?

405
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I have to say something about soon.

406
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:23,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll get to it.

407
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:28,971
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hopefully going to have some DJ Hero music during the break.

408
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:35,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, smart me forgot to bring my stupid VGA cable for my 360.

409
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:44,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm trying this really, you know, I guess MacGyver way of getting it to work by hooking up my video capture card through my PC.

410
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

411
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:50,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't like the fact that it's on two different networks, so I have to plug it into the router.

412
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:54,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But the router's cords are so short that I can't pull it out.

413
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,758
[SPEAKER_02]: and Grand Theft Auto.

414
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,319
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't pull it out?

415
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,700
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't pull the router out.

416
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want us to start disconnecting random cords.

417
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:08,464
[SPEAKER_02]: As if the storms weren't causing enough problems with the internet out.

418
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:11,726
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing we need is Loki.

419
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can pull the gray cord.

420
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the red wire.

421
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:16,869
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running long tonight anyway.

422
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,550
[SPEAKER_04]: The gray one is actually the main.

423
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:23,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just take a look at it.

424
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And free cookies!

425
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:27,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, cookies!

426
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:28,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it all better.

427
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:31,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Seg, how was your gaming week?

428
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been so busy, but I know you were going to ask me this question, so I really made it a point to actually play games.

429
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:49,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Costume Quest, which just came out on Xbox and PlayStation 3's downloadable service.

430
00:31:50,496 --> 00:32:01,585
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is Double Fine's first let's not make a game once every five years game and it's really good.

431
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: They set out to make a nice, I'll say light RPG game

432
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:25,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And the concept is, you either play, I'll say the two main characters are twins, a guy and a girl, and there's literally the point in the intro cutscene where you pick which gender you're going to be, pretty much.

433
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:29,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one you didn't pick gets kidnapped by monsters who...

434
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:38,100
[SPEAKER_03]: are trying to collect candy, but the adults think that they're just big kids dressed up so they don't believe the kids that there are real monsters out there.

435
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,641
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like Saw for children.

436
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your choice.

437
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:52,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're wearing costumes because it's Halloween, but when you go into battle mode, the costumes that are like cardboard and tape, they turn into...

438
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:55,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd totally be down for a G-rated Saw movie.

439
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,343
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be the point?

440
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:12,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be funny.

441
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:15,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

442
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:20,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been playing Game Dev Story on the iPhone because, you know, I can't get enough of game development.

443
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a nice little game.

444
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:34,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like it was a cell phone game, like your, you know, before the iPhone, you know, the days of before, before, before.

445
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:35,242
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

446
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:43,974
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really nice little game that I can play a little bit and put it to a side.

447
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:50,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got something else as I pull out my Rock Band keyboard.

448
00:33:52,806 --> 00:34:00,854
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've been playing Rock Band 3 over the weekend for research for Room Loud.

449
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

450
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no fun to be had.

451
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

452
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:37,698
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot stop the rock so are you going to have up to seven people because yeah awesome uh you know obviously if if it's a rock band one song well you know it's a rock band one song but um if the song supports it yeah though for harmonies though

453
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all three mics, and they're actually plugged into the sound system before they're plugged into the game.

454
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:48,646
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just have the mics on all the time, and people can just do harmonies or whatever anyway.

455
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:54,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you have a Rock Band 1 song, if you want to have backup singers anyway, no harm, no foul.

456
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: No harm, no foul.

457
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:57,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not about the score anyway.

458
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:58,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

459
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:00,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

460
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:05,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives the sound engineer actual control with the voice to make you sound good.

461
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

462
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know you haven't been able to spend a lot of quality time with Rock Band 3, but what do you think of First Impressions?

463
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:12,083
[SPEAKER_03]: A worthy upgrade?

464
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:20,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It is definitely Harmonix finally putting into practice the years of research and all the things they've done.

465
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:24,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that they haven't, but it's just they now, they got it.

466
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:27,276
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, they're able to put it together, and that's...

467
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,318
[SPEAKER_03]: and it really shows.

468
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:42,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how career mode is sort of always on in the sense that even when you're just doing quick play, it's still contributing to... That's so awesome.

469
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:43,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

470
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:44,950
[SPEAKER_03]: There is career...

471
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:58,657
[SPEAKER_03]: activities, like very structured career activities of like, okay, here's two songs and a set of five go and an achievement is associated with that.

472
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:02,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But just in general and in broad is just play.

473
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: the game and it's just always it's ranking up it's more of raking up the personal your personal account so it's really stressing more of bringing your profile putting it on your USB stick when you go to your friends and then you're raking up when you're at your friends place oh cool and doing that profile well that sounds really interesting yeah they're doing that so you don't have to make all these separate bands anymore that's kind of cool that's very interesting so let me ask this real quick what was the first song you had to play

474
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:32,838
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the first song?

475
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:33,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have recorded that.

476
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought there might have been one.

477
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:41,863
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I started doing Career Path and I'm totally blanking on it.

478
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:46,086
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first keyboard song, Rock Lobster.

479
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the correct answer should have been Bohemian Rhapsody.

480
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:58,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Sag, you lose.

481
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:01,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That button's never going to get old.

482
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite button.

483
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saving that for when I play with friends of mine.

484
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:11,356
[SPEAKER_03]: That you need a band for because it was just me playing alone.

485
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:12,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair counterpoint.

486
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: All by myself.

487
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the trailer for Pro Mode.

488
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,821
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty crazy with the new guitars.

489
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:19,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wow.

490
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the pro guitars, damn.

491
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:26,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And the MIDI Stratocaster that they're working on?

492
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, the MIDI stuff, like the Rock Band 3 keyboard itself is MIDI out ready.

493
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a MIDI keyboard.

494
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:52,008
[SPEAKER_03]: and on November 28th they'll have a breakout box for real professional MIDI instruments and just to plug it in directly into the console itself.

495
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:56,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you how excited I am for Pro Mode keyboards.

496
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, and that's beauty because you can do Pro Mode with the Rock Band keyboard.

497
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:11,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that you out and out need new equipment for is guitar in regards to Pro Mode.

498
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Drums, you do need the add-on for the extra cymbals.

499
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:18,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the new ones because the old ones kind of suck.

500
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:23,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're not doing a new, new rock band drum set.

501
00:38:23,312 --> 00:38:25,214
[SPEAKER_02]: But they fixed the cymbals a bit.

502
00:38:25,414 --> 00:38:33,241
[SPEAKER_03]: But the cymbals, the add-on pack is new, but there's no rock band 3 drum bass, you know, the bass of the drum kit.

503
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:34,662
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no new rock band 3 one.

504
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:39,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just they're now packaging it with the new cymbals.

505
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:42,249
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a promo for singing in there.

506
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,841
[SPEAKER_03]: No, well, what is promo mode?

507
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:45,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you get harmonies.

508
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Promo mode's oom loud.

509
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, like that.

510
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:54,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and honestly, if you go into whatever the hard mode is, it's pretty hard.

511
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:54,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

512
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Beatles rock band.

513
00:38:56,548 --> 00:39:01,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are songs that I grew up with that I wasn't hitting perfectly, so.

514
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:19,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do want John Drake will thank me for this Pro mode is great when you want to go to pro mode but don't feel that you're losing the essence of rock band if that just doesn't attract you

515
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:37,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've actually, uh, we're actually discussing taking, uh, guitar, pro guitar off the table for Umlaut just because it's too new, it's an instrument switch, and we want to focus on performance, you know, people performing and not just going on this technical prowess.

516
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:42,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you, you would be fair to say, you know what, it's too much of a pain in the butt to swap out the guitars every time.

517
00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all you have to say is those guitars are too damn expensive.

518
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:45,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.

519
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:48,560
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all sorry.

520
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:48,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-uh.

521
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We sold the guitar and gave the money to kids.

522
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:51,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Deal.

523
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

524
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us?

525
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of a Scott Pilgrim, trying to finish that out, but then Costume Quest came out, so there's that.

526
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:19,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I'm going to get crap from Bobby Blackoff if I don't try to get you for info on this at some point, because since you haven't brought it up your day job, you do work for a certain developer out there that makes a lot of amazing adventure games.

527
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:23,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Back to the Future as awesome as it sounds?

528
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it sounds awesome.

529
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:33,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you go to TelltaleGames.com and go to the blog tab, it's on game trailers.

530
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:45,763
[SPEAKER_03]: But Telltale just posted a quick little interview with the voice of Marty McFly.

531
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:49,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in Michael J. Fox, though.

532
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: He did give likeness rights and all that.

533
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:53,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to...

534
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:56,944
[SPEAKER_02]: He sounds very close to Michael J. Fox.

535
00:40:56,964 --> 00:41:01,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and let's not forget Michael J. Fox is about twice as old as he was when the movie first came out.

536
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:08,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still have to say, he didn't give his likeness rights for the pinball table, so this is kind of big.

537
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:22,901
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ LaRosso, I'm probably mispronouncing his last name and I apologize, but all I'm just going to say, go to the video and you'll hear how good it sounds.

538
00:41:23,121 --> 00:41:23,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, did you get Biff?

539
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:30,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, AJ is doing a great job with sticking on target.

540
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:35,221
[SPEAKER_03]: We do also have Christopher Lloyd as doc.

541
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:36,762
[SPEAKER_03]: He's voicing and everything.

542
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:41,686
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to seriously get him to say every word in the dictionary because that guy is not getting it.

543
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:42,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Get him while you can.

544
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, get the fiend on the table on him.

545
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:51,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm not going to pry too much on the day job because I respect that you're a friend and we don't want to see you get fired for saying too much on the show.

546
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, talk about my game like Puzzle Agent.

547
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about what's out.

548
00:41:55,864 --> 00:41:56,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Agent.

549
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Puzzle Agent.

550
00:41:59,189 --> 00:41:59,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is actually...

551
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:28,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Artstyle of Graham Annabelle who does the dank or dunk, depending on what mood he's in, comics on the TelltaleGames.com website and also has a lot of video shorts and we made a game with really his artstyle but new characters of Nelson Tethers, Puzzle Agent the single agent of the FBI Department of Puzzle Research They have that?

552
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,280
Yeah

553
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:31,505
[SPEAKER_03]: They do now!

554
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:27,220
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh no it's it's a it's it's a puzzle game with a plot and we try to do made the make the puzzles at least the the critical path ones uh relevant to the plot enough uh you know obviously there's a suspension of disbelief but try to not do something like I I can tell you this key important thing you need to know about the plot but first here's a puzzle of matchsticks uh but um

555
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:30,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having cat drama

556
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,334
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it's a nice little fun game.

557
00:43:54,394 --> 00:43:56,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out on platforms.

558
00:43:57,336 --> 00:43:58,156
[SPEAKER_03]: iPhone and PC, right?

559
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,457
[SPEAKER_03]: iPhone, PC, and Mac.

560
00:44:00,177 --> 00:44:00,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

561
00:44:00,717 --> 00:44:01,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mac, yep.

562
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:02,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't forget them.

563
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:04,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

564
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've plugged enough.

565
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,340
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

566
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,281
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's no problem.

567
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:09,241
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate you being here.

568
00:44:09,262 --> 00:44:10,142
[SPEAKER_04]: You can plug whatever.

569
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:13,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to – I don't even know what you're working on now.

570
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:15,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably couldn't talk about it anyway.

571
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:20,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But best of luck with all the upcoming projects over there at Telltale and keep up the good work.

572
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:20,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

573
00:44:20,547 --> 00:44:24,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and just saying, there really, really should be an Elvira adventure game.

574
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:27,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we need Elvira.

575
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:35,991
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't heard last week's show, we're just thinking, you know, speaking of celebrities you want to get before they're too old, Elvira really needs a good game treatment.

576
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So just something to think about for next Halloween, okay?

577
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throwing that out there.

578
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:41,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

579
00:44:41,753 --> 00:44:43,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to think what that was.

580
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew there was a game we were trying to pitch.

581
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:45,776
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

582
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:47,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Golden Girls?

583
00:44:47,357 --> 00:44:47,697
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

584
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:49,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that too, actually.

585
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,239
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a little hard to do now.

586
00:44:52,820 --> 00:45:00,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to really be able to get Bea Arthur, but you might be able to get the drag queens that play the Golden Girls in San Francisco around the Thanksgiving season.

587
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:00,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

588
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:02,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see.

589
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,628
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week.

590
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:08,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I was all excited this week because Alan actually bought me a game, and you'll appreciate this.

591
00:45:08,494 --> 00:45:10,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan actually bought me a copy of Poker Night.

592
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:12,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bless his heart.

593
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:18,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he bought me a copy of Poker Night because Steam was having an awesome little pre-order thing on it, and he's like, Oh, Rob, I bought you a game.

594
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:18,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play the game.

595
00:45:18,907 --> 00:45:19,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like...

596
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the game's not out yet.

597
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:22,874
[SPEAKER_04]: They're selling it on Steam.

598
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:25,895
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll be ready to go day one.

599
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:27,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for that, Seg.

600
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:28,076
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

601
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:31,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to rash on that at some point.

602
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:34,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, obviously, it's going to be cute.

603
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll plug Poker Night, fine.

604
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not looking for anything.

605
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:45,383
[SPEAKER_04]: My expectations going into this game are not like, my world is going to be rocked.

606
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:48,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be like... It's going to be a cute poker game with funny characters.

607
00:45:49,607 --> 00:45:49,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

608
00:45:50,287 --> 00:46:01,097
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been telling people... Yes, it's Texas Hold'em Poker with Tycho, the Heavy from TF2, Max of Salmon Max, and Strong Bad.

609
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:02,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

610
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:26,828
[SPEAKER_03]: it has more dialogue than any single episode of a Telltale game so it's not going to be five lines repeated for every single play all the time there's going to be some variety to it and it's five bucks I was selling those hotcakes at PAX actually because we also threw in a poster with it I've tried for three days to buy it

611
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:28,809
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that work?

612
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: My PayPal hasn't ever gone through.

613
00:46:31,474 --> 00:46:32,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, whose fault is that?

614
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:33,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Not mine.

615
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:36,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Valve's problem.

616
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam or whatever.

617
00:46:39,872 --> 00:46:41,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Poker Night is coming out soon.

618
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:43,916
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't even told me.

619
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:48,019
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool to know there's all that dialogue.

620
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:54,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, my expectations going in, I was thinking this is going to be like an Xbox Live Arcade style poker game with characters I recognize.

621
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:55,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

622
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:58,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope there's a lot of trash talking.

623
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like it could be a part of it with all that dialogue.

624
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:02,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are said.

625
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:03,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha!

626
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:07,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Words come out of mouths.

627
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:14,199
[SPEAKER_04]: There may or may not be playing cards in the game in some shape or fashion in Poker Night.

628
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:15,680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

629
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,720
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff aside.

630
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have that to look forward to.

631
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say a game I did buy on Steam that is out and has been out for a month that I played this week.

632
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:26,703
[SPEAKER_04]: The listeners should be very proud of me because I don't think WoW was the game I played the most this week.

633
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:27,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Shock and awe.

634
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:31,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But World of Warcraft was probably actually down there on the ladder this week because...

635
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:39,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got Civilization V on Steam and I've been playing the heck out of Civilization V because it's great.

636
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:48,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't decided if I like it more than 4 yet because I haven't truly got to the end of a game yet because it is so long.

637
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

638
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:51,029
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's good.

639
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:51,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good thing.

640
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:57,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's way better than 2 or 3 in my opinion.

641
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Way, way better than 3, that's for sure.

642
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:00,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's great.

643
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:04,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hex tile thing is actually one of the things I noticed the least.

644
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:08,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very fluid transition for the series and a very kind of like logical next step.

645
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:10,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like a lot of the subtle changes they made.

646
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:15,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the fact you can't stack armies on top of each other and just build like super army.

647
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:20,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the fact that only one unit can defend a city, so you can't have these uber cities.

648
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:24,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you have to think a different way.

649
00:48:24,898 --> 00:48:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that they have talent trees that they call social policies.

650
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a neat addition.

651
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:33,002
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all these cool little things they've added.

652
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:34,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Very customizable games.

653
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:37,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of difficulty levels, lots of sizes.

654
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:39,985
[SPEAKER_04]: The city states thing is really neat.

655
00:48:40,205 --> 00:48:41,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think I would like it at first.

656
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:48,228
[SPEAKER_04]: A city state is basically a whole new civilization that is only ever one city.

657
00:48:48,368 --> 00:48:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't aspire to grow.

658
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:53,310
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't aspire to do anything but exist in their little city state.

659
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,151
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

660
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:24,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did I get the French to surrender, but the French gave me Pittsburgh Really?

661
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:40,355
[SPEAKER_04]: How they had that, or no, sorry, Philadelphia How they had Philadelphia, I don't know, but I got it now All of those sandwiches are so French Maybe the bread It's now a Greek city in my game, because of course I'm playing as Alexander the Great

662
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:43,491
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

663
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:04,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Philadelphism is a big word Okay, I'm just saying you said the French gave it to you when you were in Greece

664
00:50:19,736 --> 00:50:21,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting how that worked out.

665
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot what I was going to say.

666
00:50:24,957 --> 00:50:30,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, the thing about Civ is you can always save, but it's always that one more turn.

667
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:32,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, oh god, yes.

668
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:34,039
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes it fun.

669
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:37,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go to bed until 1am the other night because of one more turn.

670
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one more turn.

671
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And Paris will be mine.

672
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:44,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was.

673
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:47,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So just saying.

674
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator said a junk ferret running around Paris will get France to surrender.

675
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:53,624
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I do want to also acknowledge our chat room.

676
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:54,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been such a bad boy.

677
00:50:54,704 --> 00:50:56,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't acknowledged chat all night long.

678
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:57,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.

679
00:50:57,965 --> 00:50:58,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Please join.

680
00:50:58,385 --> 00:50:59,846
[SPEAKER_04]: They've actually been a little bit quiet tonight.

681
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:00,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

682
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:01,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room.

683
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:02,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Memorized by my voice.

684
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob needs a spanking.

685
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:05,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're... Yes, maybe they just are...

686
00:51:06,888 --> 00:51:14,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, sadly, we don't have a whole lot of people from the Bay Area, so I think we've got a lot of people that are kind of like, oh, sounds cool, but, you know, plane tickets cost a lot.

687
00:51:14,255 --> 00:51:14,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

688
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:19,801
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have, I know, a lot of podcastees in the Bay, so hopefully we'll see a lot of them at the show.

689
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:23,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going to go come hell or high water, so I'll be there for sure.

690
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:28,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, actually, you know, for the... I don't know about...

691
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:36,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Other local physical events happening at 4 Child's Play.

692
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:40,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also Desert Bus for Hope, the Loading Ready Run guys.

693
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:42,451
[SPEAKER_03]: They're starting...

694
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:44,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say them.

695
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:46,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I got it on the calendar.

696
00:51:46,716 --> 00:51:54,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the folks that play Desert Bus as a marathon run for Child's Play Charity.

697
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:59,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And they start November 19th, unless things changed around a bit.

698
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:02,412
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll do the live stream and all that on the 19th.

699
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:19,003
[SPEAKER_03]: which is definitely interesting to watch because yes they're playing Desert Bus but they're also a comedy troupe so they really make it a telethon show with it awesome I've tuned into a little bit of it before it's funny, it's good times what a crap game to be playing

700
00:52:19,844 --> 00:52:22,026
[SPEAKER_04]: What a crap game to be playing for so long.

701
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,369
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, make some money.

702
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Umlaut will be streamed live.

703
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about that.

704
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:38,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting at 7pm California time, go to timeanddate.com to figure out what that means for you.

705
00:52:40,008 --> 00:52:43,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The event will be streamed live, so you can actually watch the performances.

706
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:49,960
[SPEAKER_03]: The Umlaut website will change over to that mode when it's actually happening.

707
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year, weren't you the most streamed event in the lounge's history?

708
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:56,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, we killed their internet.

709
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:05,256
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't kill it, but we were the one event that used the internet the most.

710
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:12,162
[SPEAKER_03]: This being from a venue that is currently owned by one of the co-founders of Netscape.

711
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:13,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very proud of that.

712
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:18,467
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually increased wireless capacity after that.

713
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say it's because of us, but feather in our cap.

714
00:53:24,512 --> 00:53:24,913
Yeah.

715
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:26,354
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

716
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:27,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on that.

717
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:27,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

718
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:28,475
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

719
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:31,636
[SPEAKER_04]: One more game that I played this week I want to talk about is DJ Hero 2.

720
00:53:32,297 --> 00:53:37,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though Loki kind of already talked about that a little bit, I just want to give my spin on it, pun intended.

721
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:43,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to buy the game originally because I was like, oh, yeah, $60.

722
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:43,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

723
00:53:43,863 --> 00:53:44,523
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

724
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:05,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, boy!

725
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:07,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Over and over again with the button.

726
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:09,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the way they're doing the freestyling now.

727
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:09,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much better.

728
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:12,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And the freestyle crossfades are great.

729
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:14,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And the scratching zones are really cool.

730
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,643
[SPEAKER_04]: So many more ways to freestyle and really ruin such great songs.

731
00:54:20,745 --> 00:54:22,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I do appreciate all that they've thrown in the interface.

732
00:54:22,786 --> 00:54:25,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The head-to-head modes are more interesting.

733
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the interface as a whole.

734
00:54:27,427 --> 00:54:35,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the black and white look is a little bit too plain, I just kind of like the construction of the game a lot more than I did the first mix.

735
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:40,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a worthy upgrade in the interface and what it brings to the table.

736
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:43,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Rihanna's Rude Boy Rihanna's Rude Boy

737
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:07,797
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some weird ones that I didn't recognize the song.

738
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:12,441
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one with a Tiesto song that was like an R&B song or something mixed with it.

739
00:55:12,461 --> 00:55:15,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It was surprisingly good, actually.

740
00:55:16,224 --> 00:55:19,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hopefully play those during the break.

741
00:55:19,426 --> 00:55:22,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm attempting... This is like disarming a bomb over here.

742
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:24,851
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

743
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:25,871
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's going to work.

744
00:55:26,412 --> 00:55:28,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the stuff to make it work.

745
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't understand, Rob.

746
00:55:30,054 --> 00:55:31,596
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to stop and ask for directions.

747
00:55:33,058 --> 00:55:33,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

748
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,882
[SPEAKER_05]: One more bit of housekeeping.

749
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:35,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

750
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:36,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Contest!

751
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:43,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I was threatened with domestic repercussions by my significant other if I played any song that had Soulja Boy in it one more time.

752
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:43,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

753
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:07,022
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has a contest

754
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:33,879
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our contest, and the prize is going to be a code for Xbox Live to play Castlevania Symphony of the Night, which is a fun game, one of my favorites.

755
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:45,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is really easy, and we are going to be taking an emailer at a random number, which we will decide by literally rolling a die.

756
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: on the show.

757
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:53,324
[SPEAKER_05]: This is in relation to Comic Insanity, which is the other podcast that I do.

758
00:56:54,084 --> 00:57:03,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And we broadcast every... We're actually up on InfamousNFAMOUS.net on Mondays is when the new podcast is up.

759
00:57:05,246 --> 00:57:12,147
[SPEAKER_05]: The question you have to answer is what is the name of he who shall not be named on Comic Insanity?

760
00:57:13,307 --> 00:57:14,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you a clue.

761
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:15,688
[SPEAKER_05]: We hate him.

762
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:19,516
[SPEAKER_03]: That so narrows it down.

763
00:57:19,556 --> 00:57:19,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

764
00:57:20,056 --> 00:57:20,797
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be anybody.

765
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:21,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me.

766
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:31,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can send your emails to... Go ahead and... I guess go ahead and send it to the mailbag here.

767
00:57:31,563 --> 00:57:32,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check it.

768
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:38,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orangezonesradio.com I will sift through it and we will roll a number at random and I'll pick a name.

769
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:39,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

770
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:40,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the other contest.

771
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:41,853
[SPEAKER_04]: More!

772
00:57:41,993 --> 00:57:44,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Which isn't us, but a lot of people would be interested in this.

773
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:51,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Also at Infamous.net, there is a contest to win a bunch of Blizzard goodies from BlizzCon.

774
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:53,662
[SPEAKER_05]: If you missed it, there's stuff for you.

775
00:57:54,503 --> 00:58:00,768
[SPEAKER_05]: There are free pets, um, cataclysm, uh, stuff.

776
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:03,230
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a, uh,

777
00:58:04,907 --> 00:58:06,568
[SPEAKER_05]: A demo of StarCraft 2.

778
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:12,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And a few StarCraft 2 lithos and some goodies.

779
00:58:12,352 --> 00:58:12,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of goodies.

780
00:58:12,953 --> 00:58:13,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of stuff.

781
00:58:13,553 --> 00:58:14,033
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I have to do?

782
00:58:14,093 --> 00:58:15,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Just send in a name?

783
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:18,536
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to Infamous.net and click on the contest link.

784
00:58:18,937 --> 00:58:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, again, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

785
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And click on the Blizzard contest.

786
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:26,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow the directions.

787
00:58:26,361 --> 00:58:30,884
[SPEAKER_05]: You just basically have to fill out your information and let them know what you're looking most forward to for Cataclysm.

788
00:58:31,285 --> 00:58:32,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know what my response was?

789
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:33,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

790
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:42,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Except maybe Plants vs. Zombies, but I don't play World of Warcraft, so... You've been tempted to go back a couple times, though.

791
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been.

792
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me go find the timescales.

793
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:46,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because Tiara told me that leveling is faster now.

794
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:47,675
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

795
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:49,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Cataclysm it's going to be even better.

796
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I hated leveling in freaking World of Warcraft.

797
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo-hoo.

798
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

799
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just messing.

800
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Trek Online is much more fun because I can kill Borg and play with Klingons.

801
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,504
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that working out for you?

802
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

803
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:34,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, this might be a new record, guys.

804
00:59:34,943 --> 00:59:37,406
[SPEAKER_04]: We're an hour into the show and we have yet to touch gaming news.

805
00:59:37,466 --> 00:59:37,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!

806
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:41,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright, so we're going to kind of quickly move through some gaming news tonight.

807
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

808
00:59:43,351 --> 00:59:47,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Some gaming news, if you can get away from the MacGyver stuff for a moment.

809
00:59:47,075 --> 00:59:47,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

810
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:48,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the work, by the way.

811
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:49,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

812
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:51,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm awesome like that.

813
00:59:52,138 --> 01:00:00,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox.com has gotten a makeover to kind of update everything with the new dashboard updates coming soon and whatnot.

814
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:09,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They've added avatar editors on the actual website, so now you don't have to wait until you get to your console to make your avatar look neat.

815
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, apparently, they're going to add some multiplayer web games, which...

816
01:00:17,074 --> 01:00:18,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, I guess.

817
01:00:18,677 --> 01:00:21,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's going to be some more stuff that you can...

818
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:28,949
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to tie in with different games, like how they did with Crackdown and Facebook games and stuff, perhaps.

819
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:35,992
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now they're saying that they're going to be able to play web games with your Xbox Live friends on the web or on Windows Phone 7.

820
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure those will be fun.

821
01:00:41,835 --> 01:00:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all, of course, this already came out this week, so go check it out.

822
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:51,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Are any of those free games available yet?

823
01:00:51,644 --> 01:00:52,365
[SPEAKER_02]: The web stuff?

824
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,107
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just teasing them.

825
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:59,595
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't really made them available yet, but the Avatar editor's there, so you can check that out at least.

826
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be coming out soon.

827
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:06,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm glad that they actually updated the website because there's a lot of stuff that's broken on there.

828
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:09,503
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, links to games and stuff.

829
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:12,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, okay, I want to look up stuff about Crackdown 2.

830
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that page doesn't exist.

831
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:17,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when was the last time they changed the look of the page?

832
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:20,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was even before the new Xbox experience.

833
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:24,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was before the Xbox 360 launch.

834
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,001
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I want to say they did change it with the 360.

835
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:40,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it seems that they're doing this... This was more in line with the Windows phone and all that, and they're trying to integrate... Yeah, they're really pushing this Windows phone.

836
01:01:40,813 --> 01:01:44,996
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really pushing the phone because, you know, let's face it, they're a competitor.

837
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

838
01:01:46,497 --> 01:02:13,243
[SPEAKER_04]: well and let's also not forget that there's some stories this week about how AT&T is really starting to get behind these phones because the rumors are starting to snowball a little more that they are going Verizon with the iPhone in 2011 and so AT&T is actually going to start pushing a lot more of the Windows phone I mean not to say they're not going to sell the iPhone anymore but they're going to also be pushing the Windows phones diversify the portfolio exactly exactly

839
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:17,904
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting to see if there's any truth to these so-called rumors.

840
01:02:18,124 --> 01:02:31,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say about this with the Xbox.com site that I wish Sony would do is when you hear about a game that's available as a downloadable service...

841
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:43,159
[SPEAKER_03]: At least with Xbox, if you're at work and you hear about it, you can buy it on the site and you don't have to be at your Xbox and you can make that purchase or say, okay, I want the demo.

842
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:52,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when you get back to your Xbox, it'll be downloaded waiting for you and remind you that you wanted to look at the thing and play it.

843
01:02:52,694 --> 01:02:56,095
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also just a lot more content on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

844
01:02:56,115 --> 01:03:00,016
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always at least a couple games coming out each week versus Sony.

845
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,357
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be a game coming out that week.

846
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:03,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not consistent.

847
01:03:04,297 --> 01:03:12,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you count their old PlayStation 1 classics that they're putting out.

848
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:21,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, for the both of them, Xbox needs to make their indie game service or whatever community games they're calling it now.

849
01:03:22,162 --> 01:03:22,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Showcased

850
01:03:36,573 --> 01:03:42,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly, because with the App Store, it's easy to spend money like crazy on that thing.

851
01:03:42,937 --> 01:03:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they made it more like that and had like, okay, hey, look, this feature now has weather updates, and this app does this and this, I think that would be beneficial for them, especially since they don't have a web browser.

852
01:03:58,738 --> 01:04:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I will say, though, one thing about the website, one thing I tried to look up was the Game Room website.

853
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wasn't there.

854
01:04:06,228 --> 01:04:07,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to do a search for it.

855
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Something not pretty is going on with Game Room, I'm sorry to say, but we'll see.

856
01:04:13,377 --> 01:04:14,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to kind of follow up a little bit from last week.

857
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

858
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3's latest class, the Demon Hunter, is revealed.

859
01:04:49,182 --> 01:04:51,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is supposedly the last class that's going to be in the game.

860
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:54,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, PvP battle arenas.

861
01:04:54,486 --> 01:04:55,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That does sound kind of cool.

862
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:57,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That is also coming to Diablo 3.

863
01:04:57,468 --> 01:04:58,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some of the big announcements.

864
01:04:58,889 --> 01:05:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that was missing, though, was when.

865
01:05:01,571 --> 01:05:03,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even a hint of a quarter.

866
01:05:03,952 --> 01:05:05,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Cataclysm is coming out on December 7th

867
01:05:25,953 --> 01:05:26,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Addicts!

868
01:05:26,193 --> 01:05:26,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Addicts!

869
01:05:51,036 --> 01:05:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I love them, but they're addicts and suckers

870
01:06:07,917 --> 01:06:10,519
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft 2 is going to be getting some scenarios for it.

871
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,061
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is a Defense of the Ancients scenario.

872
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Bejeweled and Left 4 Dead, some other interesting little versions of those in StarCraft 2.

873
01:06:20,547 --> 01:06:25,230
[SPEAKER_04]: But I find the Defense of the Ancients one the most interesting because Valve, of course, has their Defense of the Ancients game.

874
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:30,615
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually got the people who originally did the mod now work at Valve, but yet Blizzard is now going to make their own...

875
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:31,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

876
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:38,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have StarCraft or what they're calling Blizzard Defense of the Ancients is going to be coming to StarCraft 2 soon.

877
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, no date there.

878
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So yep, folks went to BlizzCon.

879
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guy broke his leg while dancing.

880
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Tenacious D played.

881
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:46,781
[SPEAKER_04]: People spent $150.

882
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you guys found it worth it.

883
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:52,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't have any interest.

884
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:55,345
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I'm an addict and war program, I have no interest in BlizzCon.

885
01:06:55,385 --> 01:06:55,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also $150.

886
01:06:55,725 --> 01:06:56,025
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, Seg?

887
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:02,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimate Band Package for Oomloud on sale November 1st.

888
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell you, that's probably more exciting than... That's probably a better deal.

889
01:07:06,841 --> 01:07:10,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I'm... Honestly, you guys... Maybe you can't say this year.

890
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:12,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys doing the swag bag again for the Ultimate Bands this year?

891
01:07:12,944 --> 01:07:13,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

892
01:07:13,665 --> 01:07:14,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't know what's going to be in it.

893
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,146
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to do a bag.

894
01:07:17,346 --> 01:07:20,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably going to get better shit in those bags than you do in the BlizzCon bags.

895
01:07:20,448 --> 01:07:22,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the BlizzCon bags... I can say that, too.

896
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get better stuff.

897
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:26,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they even get a pet this year in the BlizzCon?

898
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:28,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they got another... It was another Murloc, I think.

899
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:31,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.

900
01:07:32,035 --> 01:07:33,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Deathwing Murloc, I think.

901
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:34,597
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many.

902
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:35,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that correct?

903
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:36,198
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the giveaway.

904
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:37,019
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many.

905
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:42,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go win one off Infamous Gamers and don't spend $150 to get a swag bag.

906
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:50,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually looked at the live blog for it and I was like, so they announced a new class for Diablo and that was it?

907
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,830
[SPEAKER_02]: That...

908
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:52,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

909
01:08:19,185 --> 01:08:19,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

910
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:23,508
[SPEAKER_02]: By simple math, we have deduced that it is December 7th.

911
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:24,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

912
01:08:24,528 --> 01:08:27,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, yeah, that's what went on at BlizzCon.

913
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:35,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, you had angry gamers asking questions and raging in the microphone at BlizzDevelopers because everybody's so mature.

914
01:08:35,915 --> 01:08:37,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that's all the stuff you missed.

915
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:45,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to get people on Twitter to, if they were, I'm like, if you're gonna rage question, then at least rage question about real ID.

916
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:51,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Do something that actually affects your real life instead of like, stop nerfing my paladin.

917
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:52,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

918
01:08:54,656 --> 01:08:59,899
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say, if I may, since I am a Warcraft player and I'm teasing myself here a little bit.

919
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:00,419
[SPEAKER_04]: You may.

920
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:09,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That new patch that Blizzard did, although I really like some of the features and some of the changes they did, boy, did they screw some things up.

921
01:09:10,024 --> 01:09:16,688
[SPEAKER_04]: They have this bug in there right now where an icon turning into a certain shape will crash the entire game.

922
01:09:16,988 --> 01:09:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the Cogwheel bug.

923
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:22,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's great about it is that for the Halloween event, in order to summon the Halloween boss...

924
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:42,797
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta click the cogwheel on the headless horseman thing, the pumpkin So pretty much everybody crashes out They've been able to fix it with a third party fix that's available on Curse But yeah, Blizzard's too busy throwing their party to really be on top of that right now Maybe I won't go back and play it

925
01:09:44,334 --> 01:09:50,639
[SPEAKER_04]: This new patch needed a little more testing, but Blizzard really wanted that game out this year, so whatever.

926
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:58,064
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's not as much of a hot mess as another certain MMO that came out and they had to extend the trial period of the game because it was so terrible.

927
01:09:58,704 --> 01:10:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, I'm not going to go there again for another week.

928
01:10:00,725 --> 01:10:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if you don't understand, Rob, it still is the trial part of the game.

929
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:08,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be the trial part of the game for the next few years.

930
01:10:09,062 --> 01:10:09,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll stick with Final Fantasy XI

931
01:10:26,215 --> 01:10:30,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV, that's right, that's the game that sucks.

932
01:10:30,618 --> 01:10:32,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV is fucking terrible.

933
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:33,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrible.

934
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:33,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hold it in anymore.

935
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It blows.

936
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:36,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brand new game.

937
01:10:36,802 --> 01:10:40,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the same races, but we named them something more ridiculous.

938
01:10:40,464 --> 01:10:41,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sucks worse.

939
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:45,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do remember one MMO that I played that was in beta for like seven years.

940
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragnarok?

941
01:10:47,349 --> 01:10:48,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragnarok.

942
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:53,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played through the whole thing in several different languages.

943
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:56,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they better not hear you talking smack on our show or we ban you!

944
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Ragnarok.

945
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:57,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Permanently.

946
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:03,662
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this must be... My account can't be banned on Ragnarok, even though I don't play anymore on the IRO server.

947
01:11:04,062 --> 01:11:04,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Who'd you blow?

948
01:11:04,642 --> 01:11:06,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was a beta tester.

949
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:13,424
[SPEAKER_05]: All the beta accounts that played for the PvP testing got to keep their accounts.

950
01:11:13,764 --> 01:11:14,285
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to know.

951
01:11:14,765 --> 01:11:14,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

952
01:11:15,265 --> 01:11:15,745
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

953
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:22,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be a key to my personality, but the only MMO I've actually played with some length was Myst Online.

954
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:25,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Mist Online was kind of creepy.

955
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Mist Online was a great idea.

956
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:30,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And, man, Zombie Game refused to die.

957
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that game got relaunched about four times.

958
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was great, it just needed...

959
01:11:40,459 --> 01:11:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: There were just things that hung it up on interface-wise.

960
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:50,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And narrative-based MMO, that's a huge beast to fill.

961
01:11:51,925 --> 01:11:55,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

962
01:11:55,667 --> 01:12:01,810
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, talking about BlizzCon, one fan complained about the WoW characters looking like they came from Victoria's Secrets.

963
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:05,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The developer replied, what magazine do you want them to look like?

964
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:06,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

965
01:12:07,253 --> 01:12:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Penthouse Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat says all the WoW players moved on to a better game Hello Kitty Island Adventures you know what's funny is that we were at Target the other day and there was Final Fantasy 14 sitting on the shelf and Alan's like you should buy that he's like hey you should buy that you should buy that I'm like I will buy this before I buy that and I pointed at Hello Kitty online you know that Hello Kitty is getting her first Wii game coming in November no one cur alright what

966
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:42,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember me picking up a certain Bats Maru Hello Kitty game and Rob going, Oh girl, I want to play that!

967
01:12:44,012 --> 01:12:45,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And me lending it to him.

968
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:47,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Says the person that has the Hello Kitty toaster.

969
01:12:47,936 --> 01:12:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I deny these allegations, all of them.

970
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:52,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Hello Kitty TV.

971
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

972
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:56,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was a Disney Princess TV for wine.

973
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:56,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

974
01:12:57,224 --> 01:12:58,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That's much better.

975
01:12:58,305 --> 01:12:59,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave it to a seven-year-old girl.

976
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:05,251
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Hello Kitty coffee maker is no more.

977
01:13:06,232 --> 01:13:06,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

978
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:07,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a real coffee maker.

979
01:13:08,694 --> 01:13:08,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

980
01:13:09,434 --> 01:13:10,015
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

981
01:13:10,435 --> 01:13:11,196
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, Rob?

982
01:13:11,276 --> 01:13:13,878
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really want to be cool, you'll just get a French press.

983
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:16,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob Blinks.

984
01:13:18,243 --> 01:13:20,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on with more gaming news, DarkSakura.

985
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:45,890
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see them in early 2011.

986
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:52,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And... The good thing about Space Channel 5 Part 2 is that we never got it in North America.

987
01:13:52,697 --> 01:13:53,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So this means we get to play it.

988
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:56,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's really a whole bunch of Japanese in it to change.

989
01:13:57,521 --> 01:14:00,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Didn't we get... We got it on PlayStation 2 version, didn't we?

990
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think so.

991
01:14:02,826 --> 01:14:03,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

992
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:04,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got the Japanese one.

993
01:14:05,348 --> 01:14:08,351
[SPEAKER_05]: With that freaking hard one where it does all the stuff and you have to do it backwards.

994
01:14:08,551 --> 01:14:08,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

995
01:14:09,352 --> 01:14:09,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

996
01:14:11,233 --> 01:14:13,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, but it's a Mizuguchi game.

997
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:14,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really fun.

998
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:17,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Channel 5, really, really like it.

999
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:18,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Space Channel 5 Part 2.

1000
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:21,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly because of the thriller dance.

1001
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,722
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole section where they do just Michael Jackson dances.

1002
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:27,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pudding is especially fierce in Part 2.

1003
01:14:27,683 --> 01:14:28,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Pudding!

1004
01:14:31,126 --> 01:14:32,586
[SPEAKER_04]: She's my favorite, just for the record.

1005
01:14:32,706 --> 01:14:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Pudding is my favorite character.

1006
01:14:33,707 --> 01:14:35,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shermie has left the studio.

1007
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:37,810
[SPEAKER_05]: You notice she did not step on your laptop.

1008
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: She's good that way.

1009
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:39,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Good kitty.

1010
01:14:39,891 --> 01:14:39,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1011
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:43,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, crushed his laptop.

1012
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:50,223
[SPEAKER_05]: She is not that huge, and she knows better than to step on laptops because we got on door.

1013
01:14:50,463 --> 01:14:51,523
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll get a kitty spanking.

1014
01:14:52,263 --> 01:14:52,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1015
01:14:52,844 --> 01:14:53,384
[SPEAKER_04]: She likes it.

1016
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:54,444
[SPEAKER_04]: More gaming news.

1017
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:56,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie does like spankings, by the way.

1018
01:14:57,746 --> 01:14:58,526
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to know that.

1019
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:00,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Family show!

1020
01:15:00,927 --> 01:15:03,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

1021
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck family shows!

1022
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:08,350
[SPEAKER_05]: If you pet her on her lower back, she'll stick her butt up in the air and start purring.

1023
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:11,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to know what your cat's into.

1024
01:15:11,264 --> 01:15:14,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Does your cat want a leather harness for Christmas?

1025
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:15,431
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's not into that.

1026
01:15:15,831 --> 01:15:16,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, your Hanukkah?

1027
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:18,957
[SPEAKER_05]: My cat's not Jewish.

1028
01:15:19,197 --> 01:15:19,999
[SPEAKER_05]: She's agnostic.

1029
01:15:24,078 --> 01:15:41,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Ubisoft is recalling Sean White's skateboarding on the PlayStation 3, which means I'm going to have a lot of fucking work to do tomorrow because they've already shipped them all to us so that we got them to our customers, so we're going to have to do a bunch of fucking returns on it.

1030
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:48,424
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, and this was coming from some big-name retailers, they're saying that there's issues with...

1031
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:56,429
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1032
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for all the work, you fucking dumbasses.

1033
01:16:25,105 --> 01:16:26,927
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we printed it wrong!

1034
01:16:29,611 --> 01:16:31,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, Loki, mistakes happen.

1035
01:16:31,894 --> 01:16:32,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!

1036
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:35,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1037
01:16:36,516 --> 01:16:42,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there some Arab song in this that someone got offended about, you know, playing the beta or something, like LittleBigPlanet?

1038
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:44,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get one of those copies.

1039
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it was stupid.

1040
01:16:46,581 --> 01:16:48,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it better with the lyrics in the game.

1041
01:16:51,056 --> 01:16:53,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Sean White skateboarding isn't intentionally supposed to be that bad.

1042
01:16:53,838 --> 01:16:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a big title?

1043
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:56,179
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1044
01:16:56,339 --> 01:16:59,161
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people buy this game?

1045
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are like, Sean White?

1046
01:17:01,482 --> 01:17:02,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the fuck's he?

1047
01:17:02,443 --> 01:17:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the snowboarder?

1048
01:17:04,764 --> 01:17:06,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that the guy that looks like Carrot Top?

1049
01:17:06,305 --> 01:17:08,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is the guy that looks like Carrot Top.

1050
01:17:08,487 --> 01:17:09,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I know who it is.

1051
01:17:09,987 --> 01:17:15,951
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually skateboards, but Tony Hawk has a game coming out, Tony Hawk Shred, and as far as I'm aware, Tony Hawk does not fucking snowboard.

1052
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:18,613
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a poser.

1053
01:17:19,513 --> 01:17:20,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that game is terrible.

1054
01:17:20,954 --> 01:17:21,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Sean White game.

1055
01:17:21,994 --> 01:17:25,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean White game's decent, but Tony Hawk's terrible.

1056
01:17:25,296 --> 01:17:34,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if Shaquille O'Neal can do everything, like, you know, he had that whole TV show about Shaquille O'Neal does this and that, then, you know, why can't Tony Hawk decide to... And they're doing comic-style art of him.

1057
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:36,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaquille O'Neal?

1058
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And, because, with the new Celtics lineup.

1059
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:45,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can listen to Infamous.net's Comic Insanity for that.

1060
01:17:45,783 --> 01:17:46,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Plug, plug.

1061
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop is bringing us some lols in chat.

1062
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone actually seen Sean White?

1063
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:55,587
[SPEAKER_04]: What he needs is a line of shampoo and hair care, not video games.

1064
01:17:56,988 --> 01:18:04,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Salacious Pop mentioning Shermie was walking out and Salacious Pop was suggesting talk about the Sony move so she'll poop in the hall.

1065
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,660
[SPEAKER_05]: She does that.

1066
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:09,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time we bring it up, she goes out in the hall and takes a big crap.

1067
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:10,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got something better.

1068
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:17,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed when I was in the Sony Marketplace this weekend that there is a preview download for... Is Shermie listening?

1069
01:18:17,832 --> 01:18:22,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Shermie, The Tester Season 2 has a preview trailer available.

1070
01:18:22,257 --> 01:18:25,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not get my cat to take a crap because guess who has to clean that shit up?

1071
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:26,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Me!

1072
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:28,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally.

1073
01:18:29,424 --> 01:18:31,846
[SPEAKER_04]: The Tester Season 2, Shermie.

1074
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:35,949
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, disclaimer, my cat is old and fat and can't get to the bathroom easily.

1075
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:36,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1076
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,094
[SPEAKER_05]: She's fat and sassy.

1077
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:45,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about something else that's going to be very sassy, at least for fans of these series.

1078
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:46,686
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it doesn't involve cat shit.

1079
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:47,607
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't involve that.

1080
01:18:48,488 --> 01:18:52,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright are going to be colliding.

1081
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Worlds are colliding in a new 3DS adventure.

1082
01:18:56,072 --> 01:19:00,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What I love about this is that these are like two very culty kind of games on the DS.

1083
01:19:00,835 --> 01:19:04,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Like either you play them and you love them or you're like, what is this?

1084
01:19:04,137 --> 01:19:04,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

1085
01:19:05,518 --> 01:19:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So somehow, and of course I'm looking at this going...

1086
01:19:09,901 --> 01:19:11,642
[SPEAKER_04]: How does this even work?

1087
01:19:11,822 --> 01:19:14,543
[SPEAKER_04]: How do these two games even... Alright, whatever.

1088
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you watch the trailer?

1089
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:17,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, to be honest.

1090
01:19:18,105 --> 01:19:20,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, the Japanese trailer is out.

1091
01:19:21,726 --> 01:19:24,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's actually a good high-res one out.

1092
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:25,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is there?

1093
01:19:25,308 --> 01:19:26,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1094
01:19:27,508 --> 01:19:28,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really cool.

1095
01:19:28,989 --> 01:19:32,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I sat and watched the whole thing going, I can only understand half of this.

1096
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and it's going to be on the 3DS, and that's kind of awesome.

1097
01:19:35,432 --> 01:19:38,353
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the noise you hear in the background, by the way, is a little bit of the trailer, but that's like

1098
01:19:38,533 --> 01:19:39,814
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1099
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1100
01:19:57,271 --> 01:19:59,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they biting a little bit from the other puzzle game?

1101
01:20:01,257 --> 01:20:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole FBI investigation.

1102
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,822
[SPEAKER_04]: This is starting to sound a little familiar.

1103
01:20:05,443 --> 01:20:08,367
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want to look into exploring a lawsuit on this.

1104
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:08,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1105
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:09,369
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1106
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:09,729
[SPEAKER_01]: This is...

1107
01:20:11,924 --> 01:20:13,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just starting crap.

1108
01:20:14,206 --> 01:20:15,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for it.

1109
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the kind of thing of like, this can go horribly, horribly wrong, but there's a chance that it can go horribly, horribly right.

1110
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:29,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll be in 3D!

1111
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:35,526
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously though, I wait in eager anticipation to what this turns out.

1112
01:20:35,966 --> 01:20:37,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read up on it or anything.

1113
01:20:37,727 --> 01:20:40,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they even publish much to anything.

1114
01:20:41,088 --> 01:20:43,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's probably in Japanese and I'm a gaijin.

1115
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:47,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the right word, right?

1116
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:50,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you were in Japan, then yeah, you'd be gaijin.

1117
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:51,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1118
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:52,473
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1119
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:14,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this way it's described here by Level 5 President Akihiro Hino.

1120
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:18,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, two TV shows getting together and making a movie.

1121
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like Facts of Life meets Golden Girls.

1122
01:21:21,412 --> 01:21:23,632
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gotta be tons of cinematics from what they show.

1123
01:21:23,652 --> 01:21:24,893
[SPEAKER_05]: The trailer was long.

1124
01:21:25,693 --> 01:21:26,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really long.

1125
01:21:28,074 --> 01:21:30,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I bet that's gonna be pretty awesome, actually.

1126
01:21:31,454 --> 01:21:31,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1127
01:21:31,974 --> 01:21:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get into release dates?

1128
01:21:35,133 --> 01:21:36,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that's even better than Sonic 4.

1129
01:21:38,174 --> 01:21:39,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know how we feel about Sonic 4.

1130
01:21:42,155 --> 01:21:42,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, aw.

1131
01:21:43,975 --> 01:21:44,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1132
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:53,277
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a group of Sonic fans, actually two people that brought out something called Sonic Fan Remix.

1133
01:21:54,157 --> 01:21:56,878
[SPEAKER_05]: That is actually absolutely gorgeous.

1134
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it before the show.

1135
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:00,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And didn't you think it was...

1136
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty.

1137
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty.

1138
01:22:04,011 --> 01:22:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Very pretty.

1139
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got different mechanics from different Sonic games thrown in, except for the dash thing.

1140
01:22:09,233 --> 01:22:10,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks gorgeous.

1141
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:25,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that... Now, one thing that I did notice when reading up on this is that they actually brought in tons of elements from Sonic CD, which that's really how it felt to me, playing like it is playing Sonic CD.

1142
01:22:25,259 --> 01:22:26,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1143
01:22:27,728 --> 01:22:31,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, they're doing so much of a better job than what Sega's doing.

1144
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:35,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Sega should just be like, hey, um, we like you.

1145
01:22:36,012 --> 01:22:40,395
[SPEAKER_05]: But the people that are doing it is Pelican13 and Mercury.

1146
01:22:40,895 --> 01:22:42,796
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo is out to download.

1147
01:22:43,316 --> 01:22:47,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you can go to, uh, Sonic Retro and find it.

1148
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:53,862
[SPEAKER_05]: They also do have a direct, uh, let me get the link for it real quick, because there actually is a direct, uh,

1149
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:56,642
[SPEAKER_04]: SONICFANREMIX.COM SONICFANREMIX.COM

1150
01:23:25,515 --> 01:23:26,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'll file a lawsuit.

1151
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, Rob, bring up the trailer.

1152
01:23:30,546 --> 01:23:32,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Play some of the music because the music is gorgeous.

1153
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:33,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1154
01:23:33,352 --> 01:23:35,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me bring that up here from the website.

1155
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:35,577
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think?

1156
01:23:37,132 --> 01:24:04,854
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah my only you know I didn't I was just looking over your shoulder for it but definitely the backgrounds are sort of like too busy and it kind of illustrates how they're really going to 11 with the art like hey look what we're doing and gets a little too just on the edge of showboating with it yeah but not stupid it's noticeable but it's not stupid it's not completely deprimental to the game itself

1157
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'd be something to get used to.

1158
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:11,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1159
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Very pretty looking.

1160
01:24:13,213 --> 01:24:14,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I love some of the interactive backgrounds.

1161
01:24:14,914 --> 01:24:18,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, yeah, the multi-layered background thing can get a little busy.

1162
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:19,375
[SPEAKER_04]: But it kind of detracts.

1163
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:21,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love some of what they did with it.

1164
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:23,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks hot.

1165
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:25,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it when it gets into my favorite part of this music.

1166
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:27,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudos.

1167
01:24:27,678 --> 01:24:28,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, which was next.

1168
01:24:28,519 --> 01:24:29,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1169
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:29,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1170
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,040
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1171
01:24:35,226 --> 01:24:38,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that little shark thing that jumps out as he's running over the bridge.

1172
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:39,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a big killer whale, I think.

1173
01:24:39,498 --> 01:24:41,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Little touches like that are awesome.

1174
01:24:41,853 --> 01:24:46,016
[SPEAKER_05]: and it even knocks the blocks or all that same checkerboard pattern all around it.

1175
01:24:46,116 --> 01:24:47,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty fantastic.

1176
01:24:47,857 --> 01:24:56,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to say that this is an epic job and I hope it doesn't get shut down the way that the Chrono Trigger thing was because that was also awesome.

1177
01:24:56,362 --> 01:24:58,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Burr apparently has been following this pretty closely.

1178
01:24:58,524 --> 01:25:05,728
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a follow-up comment here in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com The people on the forum about it say Sega won't do anything about it.

1179
01:25:05,808 --> 01:25:07,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure why they're so confident.

1180
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:08,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1181
01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:10,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1182
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:12,495
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, definitely worth checking out.

1183
01:25:12,555 --> 01:25:14,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab it now until it becomes a problem.

1184
01:25:14,816 --> 01:25:15,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my suggestion.

1185

1187

[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, I won't read any Hello Kitty games.

1188

1223
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:25,538

1343
01:35:48,737 --> 01:35:49,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Robbie Williams.

1344
01:35:49,757 --> 01:35:54,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know he's not a big deal here in the US, but he's pretty big everywhere else.

1345
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:54,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1346
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see why he's getting his own karaoke game.

1347
01:35:57,481 --> 01:35:57,781
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1348
01:35:58,941 --> 01:36:00,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to some more news.

1349
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:03,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the classic game of the week is just a few steps away.

1350
01:36:04,284 --> 01:36:04,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1351
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:08,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so this is kind of interesting.

1352
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, and I actually saw this on the news, which is kind of weird, but there was a lot of, or it was, I guess, brought up by the Wall Street Journal that there was a bunch of Facebook applications actually transmitting user IDs and other information, I guess, to third-party advertisers.

1353
01:36:29,777 --> 01:36:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And of those applications, I guess, some of them were created by Zynga, including FarmVille.

1354
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:49,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the three of the top ten applications, FarmVille had been transmitting personal information about users' friends to outside companies.

1355
01:36:49,782 --> 01:37:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: of course your user ID is publicly available and is by itself just a number however this data can be and as apparently the Wall Street Journal reports is being shared with other parties specifically wait wait a minute wait a minute you mean to tell me that Zynga the makers of that free Farmville game and all these other free games that they knocked off from other companies you mean Zynga the company that's been called pure evil by many people on the internet

1356
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been raping my privacy this whole time.

1357
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:22,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1358
01:37:22,851 --> 01:37:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought?

1359
01:37:23,551 --> 01:37:24,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1360
01:37:24,852 --> 01:37:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: You're lying.

1361
01:37:26,232 --> 01:37:39,415
[SPEAKER_03]: If I understand it correctly, it wasn't that they're like, hey, here it is, but more of being able to access that data from other sites.

1362
01:37:40,215 --> 01:37:43,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the embedded ads.

1363
01:37:43,556 --> 01:37:45,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just like, here you go.

1364
01:37:45,537 --> 01:37:45,577
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1365
01:37:47,137 --> 01:37:47,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Please!

1366
01:37:47,617 --> 01:37:48,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it!

1367
01:37:50,138 --> 01:37:57,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just playing those games made that stuff more accessible to be grabbed and they took advantage of that.

1368
01:37:57,681 --> 01:38:00,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So wait, Amazon.com might know I'm gay?

1369
01:38:01,643 --> 01:38:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've played Farmville once in my life?

1370
01:38:04,784 --> 01:38:07,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have terrible taste in games, apparently.

1371
01:38:07,686 --> 01:38:09,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh.

1372
01:38:09,307 --> 01:38:15,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I wondered why it keeps trying to sell me Will & Grace, even Season 7, and Funny Girl on Blu-ray.

1373
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:17,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't figure that out.

1374
01:38:19,314 --> 01:38:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of this whole leak or whatever, of course, what's going to happen?

1375
01:38:24,797 --> 01:38:29,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Some lawyers are going to catch wind of this, and they're going to file a class action lawsuit.

1376
01:38:29,841 --> 01:38:30,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they did.

1377
01:38:31,342 --> 01:38:31,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently...

1378
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:35,454
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's the American way.

1379
01:38:35,734 --> 01:38:37,055
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to sue you about it.

1380
01:38:37,095 --> 01:38:47,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, law firm Edelson McGuire filed a suit with San Francisco Federal Court, I guess by St.

1381
01:38:47,141 --> 01:38:50,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul, Minnesota resident Nancy Graff.

1382
01:38:50,423 --> 01:38:57,188
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeking monetary relief for those whose data was wrongly shared and injunction relief to prevent continued privacy abuses.

1383
01:38:58,429 --> 01:39:12,019
[SPEAKER_02]: No specific amount was mentioned regarding the extent of aforementioned monetary relief, but seeing as how the announcement claims the leak has affected 218 million Facebook users, we're guessing the damages will be significant.

1384
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sought will be significant, not necessarily what they get.

1385
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:19,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1386
01:39:19,927 --> 01:39:29,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that's not too uncharacteristic for that company, but that sucks, I guess, if you're into Farmville.

1387
01:39:29,155 --> 01:39:37,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, with Facebook and stuff, a lot of your information is just kind of out there anyways, even if you're turning on your privacy settings and stuff like that.

1388
01:39:38,482 --> 01:39:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love though how, you know, this couldn't be timed any better because it always seems like, you know, that guy, that bro that runs Facebooks is like a billionaire, is always getting up on stage going, hey, you know, guys, we're really working on the privacy thing and, you know, we want your information to be secure and information and your security is our number one priority.

1389
01:39:57,275 --> 01:40:03,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it comes out like literally the next day, like Farm Bill is selling your information to the devil.

1390
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:04,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1391
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:08,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook creator is actually devil.

1392
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:22,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, yeah, so Didn't we already went through this debate with web browser cookies, which is essentially what's happening only it's a different avenue?

1393
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:41,295
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a super cookie It's a super cookie Delicious But it just seems like all it is is like, okay, we know this is a unique user, and yes, attached to Facebook, but it's not I'm not dismissing the issue, just trying to get more clarity on what the issue is

1394
01:40:42,015 --> 01:40:45,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like it's the same thing as the cookie of like, okay, unique user.

1395
01:40:46,038 --> 01:40:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: But what knocked it up the next level is that this number, which was first just like, okay, plant there, this number we generate so it can keep a unique ID.

1396
01:40:58,025 --> 01:41:04,129
[SPEAKER_03]: This time it's more persistent because it's attached to your Facebook profile and et cetera, et cetera.

1397
01:41:04,429 --> 01:41:07,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And so anything you post on Facebook might be publicly accessible.

1398
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:09,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, lesson learned.

1399
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:17,112
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to use a site like Facebook, make sure, you know, if you don't want to get it out there, don't post it or lock it down.

1400
01:41:17,472 --> 01:41:22,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're locked down to private, like my Facebook is locked down so only friends of mine can see it.

1401
01:41:22,193 --> 01:41:25,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, there's some things I just don't post on Facebook.

1402
01:41:26,114 --> 01:41:28,215
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Rob, there is a good use of Facebook.

1403
01:41:28,255 --> 01:41:28,615
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

1404
01:41:29,695 --> 01:41:33,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Umlaut on Facebook.com slash Umlaut.

1405
01:41:34,059 --> 01:41:37,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

1406
01:41:37,443 --> 01:41:39,726
[SPEAKER_04]: You had all these plugs written down on a sheet of paper.

1407
01:41:39,746 --> 01:41:40,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait till we get to Twitter.

1408
01:41:40,948 --> 01:41:43,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're playing a game.

1409
01:41:43,651 --> 01:41:44,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is at Umlaut.

1410
01:41:46,989 --> 01:41:47,649
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're at it.

1411
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:49,330
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1412
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:51,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, quickly here.

1413
01:41:52,331 --> 01:41:54,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't be able to find Rock Band on here.

1414
01:41:54,092 --> 01:41:54,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, you loud fans.

1415
01:41:55,012 --> 01:42:01,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing you will be able to find is a brand new Games for Windows Marketplace with lots of new stuff, I guess.

1416
01:42:01,895 --> 01:42:05,317
[SPEAKER_04]: November 15th is when the new Games for Windows Marketplace launches.

1417
01:42:05,337 --> 01:42:05,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know...

1418
01:42:06,477 --> 01:42:22,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, when you think about, how can I download PC games on my computer, you usually think about, I don't know, Steam is one of the big ones, or maybe Direct to Drive, or even maybe that good old game site that had that big old joke, ha ha, we're shutting down, no wait, we aren't, I think a few weeks ago.

1419
01:42:22,201 --> 01:42:24,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't usually think about, oh yeah, Games for Windows has their own marketplace.

1420
01:42:25,422 --> 01:42:28,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Microsoft's not happy with that, and they'd like to change their perception there.

1421
01:42:28,224 --> 01:42:32,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are going to be beefing up their online portal with some more stuff.

1422
01:42:33,947 --> 01:42:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all going to be branded with the whole Games for Windows Live, more competitive and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1423
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:43,012
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make it a store, really a destination for PC gamers.

1424
01:42:43,392 --> 01:42:46,514
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be stuff enabled through Live, all that good stuff.

1425
01:42:46,534 --> 01:42:49,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be revamping everything on November 15th.

1426
01:42:50,457 --> 01:42:50,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1427
01:42:51,918 --> 01:43:18,138
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're saying you should show up on day one because we're going to have a great pre-order on a title you may care about the speculation is that it's Fable 3 for the PC foreshadowing you know what though if they can match some of those sales that Steam is having you know what competition is not necessarily a bad thing because you know if they're going to try to one up Steam they're going to have to do so with some of the prices so we'll see exactly how that goes over

1428
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:34,806
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, let's get to a segment we like to do here on the show where DarkSakura dips into the video game vault and says, Hey, you ungrateful kids with your desert bus events and your umlauts and stuff.

1429
01:43:34,826 --> 01:43:35,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1430
01:43:35,146 --> 01:43:37,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to know where these games came from.

1431
01:43:37,347 --> 01:43:39,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Get off my lawn and go play these games.

1432
01:43:39,268 --> 01:43:40,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you're at it.

1433
01:43:40,249 --> 01:43:40,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

1434
01:43:40,849 --> 01:43:40,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1435
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to explore gaming's past.

1436
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:43,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull up your pants!

1437
01:43:45,413 --> 01:43:46,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy a belt!

1438
01:43:46,935 --> 01:43:52,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to explore gaming's past by checking out the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

1439
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the classic game of the week from the vault this week?

1440
01:43:54,122 --> 01:43:57,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm angry with myself for having never reviewed this one.

1441
01:43:58,166 --> 01:43:58,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic & Knuckles.

1442
01:43:59,868 --> 01:44:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done Knuckles Chaotix, I've done other Sonic games.

1443
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:03,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Have not done Sonic & Knuckles.

1444
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:04,853
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with me?

1445
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:09,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something that Sega has done right.

1446
01:44:10,153 --> 01:44:12,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rob, we have to start off with the noise.

1447
01:44:12,594 --> 01:44:14,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We always have to start off with the noise.

1448
01:44:15,475 --> 01:44:15,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

1449
01:44:18,036 --> 01:44:18,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Best music ever.

1450
01:44:27,449 --> 01:44:36,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic & Knuckles, it came out on the Genesis, also known as the Mega Drive overseas, and it was actually developed in the U.S.

1451
01:44:37,156 --> 01:44:40,338
[SPEAKER_05]: at the Sega Technical Institute by members of Sonic Team.

1452
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:48,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And it came out on October 18th, 1994, which was, guess what, the year I graduated high school!

1453
01:44:48,864 --> 01:44:50,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

1454
01:44:51,125 --> 01:44:51,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You're older than me.

1455
01:44:52,446 --> 01:44:53,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Bite my butt, Robb.

1456
01:44:54,684 --> 01:44:55,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Vintage.

1457
01:44:56,124 --> 01:44:56,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1458
01:44:57,865 --> 01:45:03,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this was a, uh, you could play it by itself, and it also locked on to Sonic 2 and Sonic 3.

1459
01:45:05,227 --> 01:45:11,808
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was actually developed with Sonic 2 and Sonic 3, so that's why it's got all the special little nummy goodies in it.

1460
01:45:12,628 --> 01:45:14,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost as delicious as these peanut butter cookies.

1461
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:17,492
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got different stories.

1462
01:45:17,592 --> 01:45:22,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually picks up from the end of Sonic 3 after the Death Egg crashes.

1463
01:45:23,476 --> 01:45:27,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, Rob, I was playing Bayonetta and I got that they were calling that dude Eggman.

1464
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was Robotnik's name and the Japanese version was Eggman.

1465
01:45:31,442 --> 01:45:31,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1466
01:45:32,523 --> 01:45:32,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1467
01:45:34,564 --> 01:45:40,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to go get the Chaos Emeralds and the Super Emeralds and all the stuff and be super awesome.

1468
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:44,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get all of them, you turn into Super Sonic.

1469
01:45:45,113 --> 01:45:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1470
01:45:45,914 --> 01:45:47,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can go to the Doomsday Zone.

1471
01:45:47,535 --> 01:45:48,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1472
01:45:48,856 --> 01:45:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can blow up the machine.

1473
01:45:51,318 --> 01:45:51,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1474
01:45:52,119 --> 01:45:53,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And return the Master Emerald.

1475
01:45:53,821 --> 01:45:56,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Which leads right into Sonic Adventure!

1476
01:45:56,323 --> 01:45:56,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1477
01:45:57,526 --> 01:45:58,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

1478
01:45:59,267 --> 01:46:01,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the island crashes back down in Sonic Adventure.

1479
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:04,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And Knuckles is pissed off at Sonic.

1480
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:05,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, anyway.

1481
01:46:06,492 --> 01:46:12,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got Knuckles' story, which everyone just beats up on him, and he's like, well, crap, I'm tired of getting you, so I'm gonna go get all these emeralds too.

1482
01:46:13,816 --> 01:46:14,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the Knuckles' story.

1483
01:46:15,037 --> 01:46:16,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you just love my paraphrasing?

1484
01:46:17,876 --> 01:46:21,039
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the way it plays, well, you can't use Tails.

1485
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:22,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

1486
01:46:23,722 --> 01:46:29,548
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you lock it on to Sonic 3, then you can play Tails.

1487
01:46:29,568 --> 01:46:32,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you just lock it on.

1488
01:46:33,312 --> 01:46:36,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got different bonus stages.

1489
01:46:36,835 --> 01:46:41,019
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got ones where you collect 20 rings by walking through these bumpers.

1490
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:46,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have the slot machines from Sonic 2, like in the Casino Night Zone.

1491
01:46:47,825 --> 01:46:52,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's, of course, the labyrinth type thing.

1492
01:46:53,570 --> 01:47:01,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also the magnetic orbs that you can use to move upwards and pick up shields and rings and lives and fun stuff.

1493
01:47:02,893 --> 01:47:08,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not have a save slot in it unless you combine it with Sonic 3 to make it Sonic 3 and Knuckles.

1494
01:47:11,076 --> 01:47:39,298
[SPEAKER_05]: so as far as other stuff in it again with Sonic 3 you can use Sonic 3 to play through as Knuckles lots of fun in Sonic 2 you can play Knuckles in Sonic 2 and you don't have to have as many rings for the little bonus zones and you can also if I remember right I think Knuckles has a lower ring no he can carry his rings over to the next stage instead of having to start over

1495
01:47:40,118 --> 01:47:41,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a big thing with that.

1496
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It was much easier to play through it with Knuckles.

1497
01:47:45,824 --> 01:47:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I'm getting motion sickness just watching this bonus stage.

1498
01:47:48,427 --> 01:47:48,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1499
01:47:49,388 --> 01:47:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I could not do the bonus stages because I would get very motion sick.

1500
01:47:56,315 --> 01:48:00,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking of those little bonus stages now, if you tried to hook up...

1501
01:48:04,083 --> 01:48:10,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sonic and Knuckles to Sonic the Hedgehog, you would get a screen with all the cast going, no way, no way, no way.

1502
01:48:12,048 --> 01:48:24,576
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you press a series of buttons, you can play the Blue Sphere game, a hundred different levels of it, and there's actually different levels depending on which game you do this with, because you can also do it with a bunch of other games.

1503
01:48:25,696 --> 01:48:31,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But keep in mind, you will not be able to play Knuckles in, you know, Bionic Commando or something like that.

1504
01:48:31,681 --> 01:48:32,341
[SPEAKER_05]: That just wouldn't work.

1505
01:48:32,982 --> 01:48:35,584
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd fly everywhere and... That would be kind of awesome, though.

1506
01:48:35,624 --> 01:48:36,584
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of awesome.

1507
01:48:36,624 --> 01:48:44,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it, they weren't able to do it in Sonic 1 because Sonic's blue was also coded to, like, the sky or something like that?

1508
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:52,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, if you, you know, they change the color on Sonic, you know, from blue to red, but then it's blood sky!

1509
01:48:52,336 --> 01:48:52,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1510
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:55,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that you say that.

1511
01:48:56,049 --> 01:48:58,129
[SPEAKER_05]: There's talking about hacks.

1512
01:48:58,709 --> 01:49:05,451
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a game hack called Miles Tails Prower, which was, you know, Tails' name is Miles Prower, which I thought was always cute.

1513
01:49:08,132 --> 01:49:14,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they did, the same group did one, it was a game basically to put Tails in Sonic the Hedgehog.

1514
01:49:15,034 --> 01:49:18,255
[SPEAKER_05]: They also did Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog.

1515
01:49:18,935 --> 01:49:37,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of changing the palettes, because you're right, it did change the sky color, they actually lifted different colors of red from another part in the game and changed the socks to blue so that he didn't have to change the palette.

1516
01:49:39,289 --> 01:49:41,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty smart of them.

1517
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:58,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing too about Sonic 2 with Knuckles is that for the longest time, because of that patch that they used to make the games work together, you couldn't find a ROM of Sonic 2 that you could play Knuckles in for the longest time.

1518
01:49:58,994 --> 01:50:00,514
[SPEAKER_05]: They've since gotten around that.

1519
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:11,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as far as the releases, what was really great, and I remember this, because I was like, I want to do this!

1520
01:50:13,311 --> 01:50:20,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Blockbuster Video and MTV had a tournament where people could play pre-release with the final one being at Alcatraz.

1521
01:50:20,515 --> 01:50:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone else remembers that.

1522
01:50:22,877 --> 01:50:27,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was called MTV's Rock the Rock Warning.

1523
01:50:30,385 --> 01:50:31,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I think I do remember that.

1524
01:50:33,787 --> 01:50:37,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out on Virtual Console, and it got a 9 from IGN.

1525
01:50:38,009 --> 01:50:40,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was very cool.

1526
01:50:41,771 --> 01:50:42,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1527
01:50:42,191 --> 01:50:43,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week, folks!

1528
01:50:44,372 --> 01:50:45,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic and Knuckles.

1529
01:50:46,593 --> 01:50:47,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do this damn stage at all.

1530
01:50:48,894 --> 01:50:50,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The bonus stages are evil.

1531
01:50:50,595 --> 01:50:53,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer... Oh, is he finally getting the Chaos Emerald?

1532
01:50:53,697 --> 01:50:53,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1533
01:50:54,277 --> 01:50:55,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1534
01:50:55,517 --> 01:50:56,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a Chaos Emerald.

1535
01:50:59,013 --> 01:50:59,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1536
01:51:00,415 --> 01:51:01,596
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is, the classic game of the week.

1537
01:51:02,196 --> 01:51:02,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy that.

1538
01:51:03,077 --> 01:51:04,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time in the works.

1539
01:51:04,299 --> 01:51:07,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic & Knuckles there on the Sega Genesis or the Mega Drive, whichever you prefer.

1540
01:51:08,002 --> 01:51:09,304
[SPEAKER_05]: What a good ending spot, too.

1541
01:51:09,484 --> 01:51:10,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good ending spot.

1542
01:51:11,226 --> 01:51:16,591
[SPEAKER_04]: That was as good of a transition as Seg has plugs for his Umlaut tonight.

1543
01:51:17,112 --> 01:51:19,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is all available at Umlaut.org, by the way.

1544
01:51:19,575 --> 01:51:20,035
[SPEAKER_04]: See what I mean?

1545
01:51:22,395 --> 01:51:25,498
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1546
01:51:25,558 --> 01:51:28,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere because when we come back, there will be plenty more.

1547
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,142
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a lot, a lot of news to get through.

1548
01:51:30,342 --> 01:51:36,007
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to ask Seg a little more about charity-related things as well, kind of like how he started this whole charity thing in the first place.

1549
01:51:36,027 --> 01:51:43,854
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to kind of get into that, especially for those of you out there that might be thinking, hmm, I want to do a fundraiser too and go on radio show podcasts and work in plugs everywhere I can.

1550
01:51:43,874 --> 01:51:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And be a mild internet celebrity.

1551
01:51:45,575 --> 01:51:46,076
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1552
01:51:46,736 --> 01:51:49,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the internet D-list.

1553
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:55,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even the celebrity D-list, and then there's the internet D-list.

1554
01:51:56,207 --> 01:51:58,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So Keyboard Cat would be on the B-list.

1555
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:00,332
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR.

1556
01:52:02,544 --> 01:52:06,366
[SPEAKER_05]: D- That means we can hang out with Kathy Griffin.

1557
01:52:07,486 --> 01:52:09,007
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's on the celebrity D-list.

1558
01:52:09,327 --> 01:52:11,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We would get to hang out with... Let's see.

1559
01:52:11,488 --> 01:52:13,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would be on about the level of OLR?

1560
01:52:13,989 --> 01:52:17,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think of internet celebrities that would be on about our level.

1561
01:52:19,491 --> 01:52:28,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking... See, even people like... Even like the kid in David Goes to the Dentist.

1562
01:52:28,214 --> 01:52:30,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the B-list or maybe even the A-list of the internet.

1563
01:52:32,472 --> 01:52:34,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we hang out with a sassy gay friend?

1564
01:52:34,874 --> 01:52:36,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Sassy gay friend's probably up there, too.

1565
01:52:36,975 --> 01:52:40,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the what-what-in-the-butt guy, because that's been a few years.

1566
01:52:40,958 --> 01:52:42,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We might be on about that level.

1567
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:45,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a few years since he was popular, so... Okay.

1568
01:52:45,921 --> 01:52:46,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1569
01:52:49,223 --> 01:52:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1570
01:52:50,604 --> 01:52:53,166
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably up there with Double Rainbow Guy, because he's kind of...

1571
01:52:55,307 --> 01:53:00,069
[SPEAKER_04]: All joking aside, I wanted to read this real quick.

1572
01:53:00,089 --> 01:53:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a comment in our chatroom from our pal Derek H, who is one of the hosts on Dead Pixel Live.

1573
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:05,111
[SPEAKER_04]: He's there weekdays at All Games Radio.

1574
01:53:05,131 --> 01:53:06,651
[SPEAKER_04]: He hosts his own little shindig there.

1575
01:53:06,671 --> 01:53:07,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun.

1576
01:53:18,535 --> 01:53:41,903
[SPEAKER_04]: sends us this link to a story on Slashdot about is Zynga trying to patent virtual currency since we were talking about Zynga and how some of their ethics may be questionable once in a while I thought this was kind of fascinating apparently a recent patent application was spotted by Zynga attempting to patent virtual currency purchased with real money for use in a gambling context

1577
01:53:42,723 --> 01:53:48,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm thinking, and this website's thinking as well, aren't there already plenty of ways that that exists?

1578
01:53:48,227 --> 01:53:51,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, Xbox 360 money?

1579
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:56,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I mean, just a lot of MMOs out there you can buy money for.

1580
01:53:56,854 --> 01:54:00,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they get the patent, then they have the patent.

1581
01:54:00,456 --> 01:54:10,243
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they get it denied because of prior art or whatever ruling, then they can say, if someone else tries to claim it, they'll go, oh, no, no, no, no, we did, and the...

1582
01:54:11,944 --> 01:54:14,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent Office said, oh, it can't be patented.

1583
01:54:14,405 --> 01:54:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it's a move to protect themselves in the long run?

1584
01:54:17,106 --> 01:54:17,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1585
01:54:17,787 --> 01:54:21,148
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think filing all these patents and all this news is for?

1586
01:54:21,468 --> 01:54:22,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1587
01:54:22,308 --> 01:54:22,589
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1588
01:54:22,729 --> 01:54:23,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1589
01:54:23,289 --> 01:54:23,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1590
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:27,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens with that because, heaven forbid, they should be granted the patent.

1591
01:54:28,091 --> 01:54:29,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1592
01:54:29,491 --> 01:54:29,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1593
01:54:30,192 --> 01:54:30,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1594
01:54:30,712 --> 01:54:33,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1595
01:54:33,053 --> 01:54:33,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go anywhere, guys.

1596
01:54:33,773 --> 01:54:34,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.

1597
01:54:34,233 --> 01:54:35,854
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back right after this.

1598
01:54:42,692 --> 01:54:45,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1599
01:54:45,293 --> 01:54:54,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 24th of 2010, for the 387th episode of our little podcast here.

1600
01:54:54,657 --> 01:54:55,818
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1601
01:54:55,838 --> 01:55:03,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at AllGames.com, where you just heard during the break there, if you were listening live, we can't put it on the podcast because it's copyright music.

1602
01:55:03,781 --> 01:55:05,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We played some music from DJ Hero 2.

1603
01:55:05,502 --> 01:55:07,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of had the whole thing going live here in studio, though.

1604
01:55:07,703 --> 01:55:08,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty awesome.

1605
01:55:08,784 --> 01:55:11,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Also live in studio tonight, joining us, The Seg.

1606
01:55:12,265 --> 01:55:17,086
[SPEAKER_04]: He is one of the co-founders of Umlaut, but he really hasn't talked a lot about it tonight.

1607
01:55:17,206 --> 01:55:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been coaxing him like, hey, if you show up to the show, you've got to try and drop a plug or two for what you're trying to sell.

1608
01:55:23,408 --> 01:55:27,649
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's hard to get people to go to Umlaut.org and read all about our charity.

1609
01:55:27,729 --> 01:55:27,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1610
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:28,890
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1611
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:31,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So just try to work in a couple more plugs if you could.

1612
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:37,232
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, say, I just would hate for you to have wasted that tank of gas to get here and then just not talk about your charity event.

1613
01:55:37,532 --> 01:55:38,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly.

1614
01:55:40,174 --> 01:55:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard trying to get people even to follow our Twitter account, which is at umloud, U-M-L-O-U-D.

1615
01:55:46,118 --> 01:55:46,419
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1616
01:55:46,479 --> 01:55:46,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1617
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,080
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1618
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:48,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1619
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:52,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, I want to ask you some more questions here since we have you here tonight.

1620
01:55:52,123 --> 01:55:53,524
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so kind to be here live.

1621
01:55:53,644 --> 01:55:55,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one thing you've also been doing a lot of this year.

1622
01:55:56,286 --> 01:56:02,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides the Telltale stuff, besides the Umlaut planning, another thing you've been doing quite a bit is you've been doing speaking events.

1623
01:56:03,069 --> 01:56:07,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you did PAX East because I saw your panel there when I went to PAX East earlier this year.

1624
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:09,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you did – didn't you do a companion piece at PAX West?

1625
01:56:09,913 --> 01:56:10,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1626
01:56:10,193 --> 01:56:12,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of same song, different verse type of deal?

1627
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:13,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Same song, different time.

1628
01:56:13,274 --> 01:56:14,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1629
01:56:14,815 --> 01:56:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Different audience.

1630
01:56:15,696 --> 01:56:17,497
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the panel all about that you were doing?

1631
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:19,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was trying to –

1632
01:56:20,838 --> 01:56:46,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're trying to communicate, okay, there's a lot of people who obviously give to Child's Play, and there's definitely a lot of people who want to do more, and what I wanted to do with the panels is to establish and get the right general questions answered for people who want to start their own Child's Play community fundraiser.

1633
01:56:47,239 --> 01:56:59,243
[SPEAKER_03]: and what that means and just sort of the broad overview of where to get started and to take that next step of starting your own event whether it's a local event or an internet based event.

1634
01:57:00,445 --> 01:57:05,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I obviously, you know, we could, we could probably have you recap everything, but that would take an hour, like your panel.

1635
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:07,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to, I don't want to recap the whole thing.

1636
01:57:07,730 --> 01:57:15,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but just trying to get some of the points out, like, what would you say for somebody who is trying to plan one of these events for themselves?

1637
01:57:15,294 --> 01:57:16,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe you can speak from experience on this.

1638
01:57:17,296 --> 01:57:22,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what's one thing that people don't anticipate when they say, hey, I'm

1639
01:57:22,939 --> 01:57:29,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna throw a rock band charity event at this, I don't know, the Masonic Lodge or wherever people are doing things.

1640
01:57:29,823 --> 01:57:31,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we wanna do like a little charity event.

1641
01:57:31,764 --> 01:57:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you think is like one of the top things people don't foresee in the planning of these events that comes back to surprise them?

1642
01:57:38,588 --> 01:57:42,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oops, we should have thought about X. Well, uh...

1643
01:57:43,512 --> 01:57:54,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides the legal thing, which is a whole other conversation we'll touch on in a few moments, but the big thing that I stress is set up...

1644
01:57:56,189 --> 01:57:59,871
[SPEAKER_03]: What I call a list of products, if you're doing an event.

1645
01:58:00,311 --> 01:58:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, okay, these are the things that we're going to have as a quote-unquote product for the event.

1646
01:58:07,355 --> 01:58:17,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So to take Umlaut, for example, we have this ultimate band package product, we have this headliner band product, we have the ticket in the door product, we have the raffle ticket product.

1647
01:58:18,081 --> 01:58:23,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And by listing these down, you go, okay, how do we make this happen?

1648
01:58:23,724 --> 01:58:30,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's really sort of lost because people don't really know how to take the thing from soup to nuts.

1649
01:58:30,275 --> 01:58:36,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be a great idea, but you're actually at the event and you go, oh crap, how do I do this?

1650
01:58:36,524 --> 01:58:36,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh crap.

1651
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:41,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we have to do all this stuff and then fumble from there.

1652
01:58:41,932 --> 01:59:01,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really take a step back with your team and go, start brainstorming, get all the ideas in the world, but then realize that it may be best to put some things off the table if you can't deliver on them because if you do too much and not account for it, it's all going to go to shambles.

1653
01:59:01,961 --> 01:59:02,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's best to just

1654
01:59:03,655 --> 01:59:12,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold back and make sure you establish yourself and maybe next year you'll do that thing that you wanted to do or whatever.

1655
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:14,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, awesome.

1656
01:59:14,939 --> 01:59:15,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think of other things.

1657
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think sometimes people maybe think too big when it comes to these things?

1658
01:59:22,082 --> 01:59:23,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say yeah.

1659
01:59:23,323 --> 01:59:30,145
[SPEAKER_03]: As people who have the best of intentions and believe me, I'm not discouraging it as someone who did a show in eight weeks.

1660
01:59:31,926 --> 01:59:32,186
[SPEAKER_03]: But

1661
01:59:32,557 --> 01:59:56,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, for Umlaut, Umlaut wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Foom Drawzer, which was an event that was actually founded by Joel Johnson, started in New York, and then grew to Denver with Brian Cassente of Kotaku doing the Denver event, and then Gizmodo did the San Francisco event, and I went to that event, showed up, and it was

1662
01:59:56,941 --> 02:00:04,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at Shine Bar on Leet Mission Street in San Francisco, 1337 Mission Street.

1663
02:00:05,114 --> 02:00:11,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a 200 capacity bar and it was just show up with rock band, you know, very simple, but packed the place.

1664
02:00:12,834 --> 02:00:18,597
[SPEAKER_03]: and that established, okay, there is, we can get enough people in here and that was just with Day of Advertising.

1665
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:26,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always, I hadn't done charity work for a while and I wanted to get back into the swing of it.

1666
02:00:27,523 --> 02:00:37,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And separately, I always wanted to do an event that incorporated rock band, guitar hero rock band, but focused on the performance aspect.

1667
02:00:39,129 --> 02:01:01,187
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was just this perfect storm so I threw my hat in and that's when I first got introduced to Chris Kohler who also helped out with the Fungrauser event in 08 and it was us planning this out actually throughout the year but with Joel and Joel had a lot of things going on so he couldn't

1668
02:01:01,607 --> 02:01:17,302
[SPEAKER_03]: continue on and so we were left with making our own event since we already had the deposit reserved for DNA and got things together and it really, it also, don't do this alone, I think is the other thing.

1669
02:01:18,763 --> 02:01:20,665
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't get other people to do it

1670
02:01:22,594 --> 02:01:23,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't break yourself.

1671
02:01:24,195 --> 02:01:27,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not trying to discourage people.

1672
02:01:27,377 --> 02:01:29,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to knock them down.

1673
02:01:29,739 --> 02:01:35,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're a big control freak like me and you want to do everything, you just have to let some of it go because it's too much for one person.

1674
02:01:36,224 --> 02:01:43,109
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes down to if you can't get people to help you quite yet in working the event, how are you going to get people there?

1675
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:44,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fair question.

1676
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:45,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fair question.

1677
02:01:46,972 --> 02:01:48,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say be realistic.

1678
02:01:48,633 --> 02:01:48,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1679
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't that outright discourage you.

1680
02:01:53,422 --> 02:01:53,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1681
02:01:53,642 --> 02:01:56,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let any of this scare you off from trying to do something like that.

1682
02:01:56,944 --> 02:01:58,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's important too.

1683
02:01:58,084 --> 02:02:03,968
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just trying to be real here on OLR and say, if you're ready to take this dive, by all means dive.

1684
02:02:04,248 --> 02:02:05,529
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's some floaties.

1685
02:02:06,129 --> 02:02:07,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Some tips so that you don't drown.

1686
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:10,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me get to a question from our chat room if I could here.

1687
02:02:10,312 --> 02:02:21,960
[SPEAKER_04]: At chat.orangefantasia.com, Salacious Pop is in chat and wants to know, Seg, how long did it take to get incorporated as a non-profit so that people could legally write off donations to you in their taxes?

1688
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the fees steep?

1689
02:02:23,241 --> 02:02:26,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have to do it through an attorney to protect your own name and assets?

1690
02:02:27,604 --> 02:02:34,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the benefit of a wonderful father who does this...

1691
02:02:35,909 --> 02:02:36,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty professionally.

1692
02:02:36,910 --> 02:02:40,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that just like he doesn't actually have it as a job job.

1693
02:02:40,133 --> 02:02:51,041
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I alluded to, sort of the family business that wasn't really a business was charity events back home in Detroit, Dearborn.

1694
02:02:52,823 --> 02:02:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did Detroit Children's Hospital Festival of Trees.

1695
02:02:56,946 --> 02:02:58,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1696
02:02:59,088 --> 02:03:01,711
[SPEAKER_03]: and our high school auction and all that.

1697
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:07,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So he already knows how to, you know, the tax end of things.

1698
02:03:08,419 --> 02:03:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: The state of California was definitely new to us and oh, the state of California was definitely new to us for those filings.

1699
02:03:16,449 --> 02:03:17,931
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's

1700
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:22,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of a level thing.

1701
02:03:23,223 --> 02:03:42,155
[SPEAKER_03]: The official birth date, as far as the IRS and the state of California is concerned, for Umlaut is November 17th, and that was when the California URA business that happens to be non-profit was first minted, which is pretty quick.

1702
02:03:42,196 --> 02:03:48,640
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, for all the stuff you want to do, like donation buttons, either PayPal or Google Checkout and all that,

1703
02:03:49,921 --> 02:04:00,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we got the TIN very easily, the text ID number for Umlaut, but then you have all this other stuff that has to go through.

1704
02:04:00,926 --> 02:04:07,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a while for the IRS to process the paperwork, and you have to fill out the longer form and all this.

1705
02:04:07,729 --> 02:04:17,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, things did not get settled, settled, settled as far as establishing and getting our determination letter from the IRS until like...

1706
02:04:18,803 --> 02:04:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1707
02:04:38,047 --> 02:04:42,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your paperwork in and know that we could revoke the status because something didn't clear.

1708
02:04:45,449 --> 02:04:46,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was up to snuff.

1709
02:04:47,049 --> 02:04:55,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to back you up in our chat room, DefectiveCandy is in our chat at chat.orange.radio.com and says, From experience, the state of Michigan is way easier to do the non-profit than a place like Cali.

1710
02:04:56,631 --> 02:05:04,072
[SPEAKER_03]: California, actually, from what I've been told by others, is the most complicated in the union.

1711
02:05:05,153 --> 02:05:06,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I should also state that

1712
02:05:07,122 --> 02:05:10,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Every state has a different way, completely.

1713
02:05:10,746 --> 02:05:13,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the IRS is obviously consistent within the U.S.

1714
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:15,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of the U.S., I don't know.

1715
02:05:18,115 --> 02:05:20,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, go ahead.

1716
02:05:20,578 --> 02:05:26,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I do these panels, I guide people to the general questions that they have to ask themselves, which is basically...

1717
02:05:27,566 --> 02:05:34,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Start by Googling up whatever entity in your state does business entities.

1718
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:37,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Secretary of State usually, but not always.

1719
02:05:38,011 --> 02:05:39,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they have a separate department and all that.

1720
02:05:39,912 --> 02:05:42,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will start you down on the road of what you need to do.

1721
02:05:42,774 --> 02:05:44,415
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't let all this stuff freak you out either.

1722
02:05:44,595 --> 02:05:51,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I should also say that there's sort of two general avenues of, at least for Child's Play community fundraisers.

1723
02:05:51,938 --> 02:05:52,759
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the...

1724
02:05:54,073 --> 02:05:56,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Actual, local, physical event, which is what we do.

1725
02:05:56,634 --> 02:05:58,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the internet-based fundraisers.

1726
02:05:58,835 --> 02:06:02,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the internet-based ones, they haven't made as long as they're not stupid.

1727
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:08,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, for example, Desert Bus, which is the online telethon for them.

1728
02:06:09,938 --> 02:06:18,500
[SPEAKER_03]: They use chip-in to point directly to the Child's Play PayPal account, meaning they never touch the money.

1729
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:19,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

1730
02:06:19,901 --> 02:06:20,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

1731
02:06:20,761 --> 02:06:29,823
[SPEAKER_03]: The chip-in tracks the metrics of how much people clicking on their button went to Child's Play, but they never touch the money, so they don't have to do any of this.

1732
02:06:31,584 --> 02:06:36,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We touch the money at UMA because we have to pay for the venue, and we're taking in

1733
02:06:37,345 --> 02:06:41,886
[SPEAKER_03]: and donations ourselves in this physical event, so we have to go through the process.

1734
02:06:42,607 --> 02:06:57,291
[SPEAKER_03]: The big numbers, at least at the IRS level, is if you get more than $250 from any one individual or your total take is $5,000, you need a file.

1735
02:06:58,851 --> 02:07:02,272
[SPEAKER_03]: You've graduated up to, nope, you need to do it for reals.

1736
02:07:03,095 --> 02:07:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a great follow up from Defective Candy here in our chat room saying there are some great books on the matter I like Nolo's How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation and all states have info on how to do them on their official website you might have to do a tiny bit of digging let me throw this out there too one more kind of little thing here because I know this is one of the things I took away from the panel I was like oh yeah that's something I might not think about otherwise but say if somebody wants to do a Child's Play fundraiser you know before just throwing the name out there like hey we're going to do this Child's Play fundraiser

1737
02:07:32,219 --> 02:07:34,460
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably people they should be getting in touch with, right?

1738
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:41,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Kristen Lindsay is... I'm sorry, Kristen, I'm totally forgetting your new title position.

1739
02:07:41,302 --> 02:07:45,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the official title, but she's the woman in charge of Child's Play.

1740
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:47,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We will call her Goddess of Child's Play.

1741
02:07:47,724 --> 02:07:49,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Goddess of Child's Play.

1742
02:07:50,265 --> 02:07:52,106
[SPEAKER_03]: She has an official title, and I apologize for that.

1743
02:07:52,726 --> 02:07:54,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay, it's live radio, you're on the spot.

1744
02:07:54,427 --> 02:08:00,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's sort of... Child's Play's not going to give you too much help because, let's face it, it's a...

1745
02:08:01,409 --> 02:08:02,689
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to run the event for you.

1746
02:08:02,729 --> 02:08:04,110
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to run the event for you.

1747
02:08:05,190 --> 02:08:10,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to check in with her and sending an email to her saying, hey, we're doing this event.

1748
02:08:13,253 --> 02:08:23,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And she'll give some help, but you have to understand that everyone else is doing all this stuff, especially around this time when the season's ramping up again.

1749
02:08:23,336 --> 02:08:24,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1750
02:08:25,804 --> 02:08:30,967
[SPEAKER_03]: The process of giving them money is, if you're doing the chip-in thing, the internet-based thing, well, you don't have to do anything.

1751
02:08:31,007 --> 02:08:32,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already into their PayPal account.

1752
02:08:33,868 --> 02:08:46,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us, we mail a checkout made out to Child's Play Charity and mail it in to the mailing address that's on the Child's Play website, and there's that.

1753
02:08:47,275 --> 02:08:47,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1754
02:09:09,454 --> 02:09:13,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I don't want to spend too much more time talking about that.

1755
02:09:14,157 --> 02:09:16,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ruin your possible panels in 2011.

1756
02:09:16,119 --> 02:09:23,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know if you're going to be doing it all over again, but it was, at least when I went and saw it at PAX East, I certainly learned a lot.

1757
02:09:24,885 --> 02:09:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've kind of dabbled in the idea of maybe doing an OLR charity something something at some point, so it was interesting to hear all that.

1758
02:09:30,449 --> 02:09:31,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good deal.

1759
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:33,211
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1760
02:09:52,750 --> 02:10:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's interesting there's been a little bit of back and forth between Interplay and Bethesda over the rights for Fallout and stuff and I believe at one point Interplay was demanding 50 million dollars for Fallout and apparently Bethesda said no so it'll be interesting to see and I'm sure that a Fallout MMO will be pretty interesting but we'll have to wait a couple years for that

1761
02:10:18,356 --> 02:10:22,279
[SPEAKER_02]: The ESRB is rated Twisted Metal for the PlayStation 1 Classics.

1762
02:10:23,259 --> 02:10:24,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously that will be coming around pretty soon.

1763
02:10:25,481 --> 02:10:29,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe to tie in a little bit with the new Twisted Metal game maybe coming out next year.

1764
02:10:29,643 --> 02:10:32,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to wait for that one.

1765
02:10:32,865 --> 02:10:34,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least you can expect that.

1766
02:10:35,527 --> 02:10:42,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a racing game that is on the PlayStation 3 right now, Mod Nation Racers, is going to be getting a Stunt Pack.

1767
02:10:42,771 --> 02:10:43,672
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1768
02:11:06,145 --> 02:11:07,667
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is free for two weeks.

1769
02:11:07,927 --> 02:11:09,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beginning October 26th.

1770
02:11:09,569 --> 02:11:13,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do have that game or if you're thinking about picking up that game, you might want to download that.

1771
02:11:14,614 --> 02:11:15,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurry, hurry.

1772
02:11:17,137 --> 02:11:17,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1773
02:11:18,292 --> 02:11:39,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some quick stuff for you guys too One of them is about Xbox Live The Xbox Live Silver account is no more It is gone, it is out of here But don't worry You didn't all get suddenly upgraded to gold Actually I don't think that's something anyone would worry about No, here's what really happened The Xbox Live Silver memberships are now just called Xbox Live Free Membership It is what it is Yeah, finally

1774
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:40,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

1775
02:11:40,902 --> 02:11:45,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is launched right along with the Xbox.com remake that went live this week.

1776
02:11:46,248 --> 02:11:48,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just basically say it's free.

1777
02:11:49,631 --> 02:11:51,774
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying the features did not change.

1778
02:11:51,914 --> 02:11:54,036
[SPEAKER_04]: The name for the paid membership does not change.

1779
02:11:54,176 --> 02:11:55,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Just this little component of it.

1780
02:11:56,179 --> 02:11:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know.

1781
02:11:56,739 --> 02:11:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier branding.

1782
02:11:58,221 --> 02:11:58,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

1783
02:11:58,902 --> 02:11:59,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1784
02:12:00,983 --> 02:12:10,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I think especially when one of PlayStation's big things is selling the free PlayStation Network, I think for them to be able to say... Not quite anymore, but... Yeah, exactly.

1785
02:12:10,426 --> 02:12:12,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're kind of on par there, so it works out.

1786
02:12:13,668 --> 02:12:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Tron Evolution is getting some voice acting from the movie, which is pretty cool.

1787
02:12:17,549 --> 02:12:24,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Olivia Wilde, who plays Korra in the upcoming Tron Legacy movie, is going to be doing some voices in Tron Evolution.

1788
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

1789
02:12:25,251 --> 02:12:29,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the voice of the original Tron character, Bruce Boxleitner, is going to be in there, so that's

1790
02:12:30,614 --> 02:12:32,275
[SPEAKER_05]: From the Scarecrow and Mrs. King

1791
02:13:00,317 --> 02:13:07,965
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA Jam, as we've talked about for a couple weeks on this show, is getting spun off into its PS3 and 360 retail releases.

1792
02:13:08,366 --> 02:13:09,006
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is going to be $49.99.

1793
02:13:09,147 --> 02:13:12,430

02:13:16,054 --> 02:13:21,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it should be noted that it is going to be online and all that, but not on the Wii.

1796
02:13:22,319 --> 02:13:23,199
[SPEAKER_04]: That version is already out.

1797
02:13:23,339 --> 02:13:26,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Online will be available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be two-on-two online.

1799
02:13:29,304 --> 02:13:36,789
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a title update in December that will have a remix jam party for up to four players and all sorts of that fun stuff.

1800
02:13:37,930 --> 02:13:41,893
[SPEAKER_04]: $49.99 if you want to check out NBA Jam on the 360 or the PS3.

1801
02:13:42,293 --> 02:13:43,314
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on fire!

1802
02:13:44,383 --> 02:13:45,304
