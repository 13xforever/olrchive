13988	24717	Tonight, October 10th, 2010, DC Universe Online faces a delay, OnLive gets cheaper to use, and another classic arcade game is set for revival on this gen's consoles.
32085	37306	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37346	39607	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39967	44288	We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
44448	45749	And we don't forget the episode number.
46149	48189	www.allgames.com.
48249	49470	I always forget the episode number.
49570	52331	It's episode 385 for those that are still counting.
52671	57952	The smart ass you hear over there in the corner is my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
58752	59092	How are you?
59132	61233	I'm inhaling bacon fumes and it's not kosher.
62103	63044	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
83083	88885	I wonder because there used to be a guy when I was working at Roundtable that would order a quadruple sausage pizza.
89265	95066	It literally is like a three-quarter inch thick layer of sausage that's just on top of the pizza.
95326	97647	For those who don't know, Roundtable is a big pizza chain.
97667	98507	On the West Coast, yeah.
98567	100167	The whole West Coast or just California?
100707	101247	Mostly California.
101267	103788	You can make it work if you did extra cheese, triple bacon.
105487	105888	You're right.
106488	112535	The problem was it was too greasy and actually the point is actually you couldn't really taste the pizza with the bacon.
112595	119523	This is actually really sweet because the sauce is really sweet, but it might be able to work with like two and a half times bacon.
119584	120745	It would work if it was on a rack.
120945	126449	Do you remember there was an episode probably about two years ago, maybe a year ago, where you brought all these bacon dishes to the show?
126969	127309	Yes.
127429	129971	I never thought in my life that I would ever say this is too much bacon.
129991	130571	The bacon scallops.
130771	131712	That was last year.
131732	132632	That was too much bacon.
132672	133173	Was it last year?
133193	134834	That was my birthday last year.
134854	135854	That was actually really good.
135874	136595	That was a lot of bacon.
136615	138196	But there was so much bacon left over.
138931	139551	Yes, there was.
140051	142192	And you guys left it at my house?
143012	145533	I would probably do just like a meat party instead.
146233	152335	Because seriously, bacon, even cooking it the entire day, it's not very good.
152695	154835	Now, steak party, that's good.
154955	159797	That sounds like a game that they should sell on the shelves of Target right between Blind Date and Mall Madness.
159977	160557	Meat party!
161477	162497	That totally could not be here.
163258	164658	I only eat meat once a month.
165492	166752	Well, it'll have to be on that day.
167453	167713	All right.
168053	168353	Anyhow.
168813	169173	Hi.
169814	171074	I missed you guys last week.
171354	173435	My aim is still improving ever so much, though.
174035	175316	Oh, we did fine without you, Rob.
175336	176316	You can just go home if you want.
176476	176816	Okay, bye.
176956	177296	No, I'm kidding.
177817	183639	No, well, actually, I turned on the show while I was at the airport just to make sure that you guys, like...
184119	184700	We're alive.
184720	186281	Because he didn't trust us.
186321	188062	Well, you never had done it before.
188102	190264	So I just want to make sure you didn't get into a train wreck.
190284	190804	You know what I mean?
191445	193926	And then you guys, I heard like five seconds of the show.
193966	195407	You guys were on the phone with Aki Ripper.
195448	196228	And I'm like, oh, okay.
196248	197389	They're already into calls.
198110	199751	And then after that, everything fell apart.
200131	200691	Did it really?
201532	203133	We kept losing the stream.
203153	203954	It's because I tuned in.
204454	206155	So what did I miss on last week's show?
206196	207657	I have not heard it yet.
207897	209598	And I apologize to the podcastees.
210058	211880	I mean, by the time they hear this, they'll be okay.
212020	213161	You missed Tiara.
213921	216022	Well, I've talked to Tiara before.
216062	217103	I know she's a fun gal.
217143	217383	I enjoy her.
217403	219384	But you missed her fun hosting capabilities.
219484	222345	Did she do the Rob role where she kept you all in check?
222586	224366	Made sure you were following the show role?
225147	225427	Did she?
226027	229389	Yeah.
229889	230289	No.
231190	231530	Some.
231590	231830	Great.
231850	233031	I'm sure that show was awesome.
233051	233391	No, I'm kidding.
233411	234852	I think I skipped a story once.
235912	236933	And then we went back and did it.
237333	246817	Alright, well I'm glad to hear things were good and that means I can take vacations more often It's better than the last time we tried to run the show without you Wasn't that the show where you ended up watching like a porno?
247157	260142	Yeah Good times, good times Well I went to Disneyland last week as you guys know and I had a good time Bitch Yeah, I'm fresh out of Space Mountain Bitch But DarkSakura and I are still trying to get the December 17th thing to work
260342	263923	We got to just cross the T's and dot the I's and all that stuff.
263963	267144	I have an annual pass again, so going back won't be a problem for me.
267685	274587	And I saw some of the pictures from Electronica, which started this week, and they actually have a whole little Flynn's Arcade with like 80s old school video games.
274607	274927	We're there.
275527	276348	I know, it's going to be fun.
276368	276708	We're going.
276848	277368	Good times.
278248	278488	Anyhow.
278629	279509	No one can stop us.
280249	280650	No one.
282351	283591	Except maybe the bank.
283871	284352	Smite!
284972	285532	Maybe the bank.
285913	286753	The bank could stop us.
287353	287814	Smite.
288594	289775	Let's start off the show.
290215	292556	Let's see, we've talked about food, we've talked about Disneyland.
292576	294017	Is there anything else we talk about on this show?
294537	295278	Oh yeah, video games.
295358	296498	Once in a while we talk about video games.
296518	298099	How about Rainbow Fighting Universe?
298820	303282	No, seriously, someone... I was at Outback last night for my one steak a month.
303462	304303	Quit, I quit.
304703	306385	I'm going back to Disneyland.
307425	310508	My favorite joke to do is when someone says, do you need anything else or want anything else?
310548	311809	I say, yeah, like a pony, please.
312490	313190	And she said, oh.
313671	317734	And the girl said, my friend Jamie always asks for a unicorn that poops rainbows.
318235	320096	And I was like, my name is Jamie.
320437	322058	And she's like, oh, wow.
322178	324060	My answer would be, how would you like that cooked?
326575	327395	I guess you had to be there.
331297	332537	I'm sleep deprived.
332577	334618	Rob brought me caffeine unprompted.
335038	338959	Well, because I know it puts you in a good mood and I don't want to have to deal with bitch Jamie all night.
339019	340399	Anyway, love hearts.
340980	341660	Here's the thing.
343420	343780	Here's the thing.
344221	348742	I see some folks in chat complaining that the podcast is not yet uploaded from last week and I swear...
349322	352223	I'm not doing it out of spite.
352583	353183	No, here's the deal.
353343	354603	I got super sick.
354944	356124	Rob got super hungover.
356624	358845	I missed a day at Disneyland due to being sick.
359005	361225	I made Alan go to the park without me on Sunday.
361605	367807	And I thought I was getting better come Monday, but then Tuesday, the day I was supposed to come over and get all the show stuff taken care of, I had the worst fever.
367827	368787	I had to call in sick to work.
368927	371948	And that's a big deal for me to call in sick to work because I really don't.
371988	372968	Rob has amazing work ethic.
372988	375509	He did that fantastic crib place across the street from Disneyland.
375769	377992	Actually, we did eat at Tony Roma's.
378033	379695	Yes, we did eat there, actually.
382359	382699	That's right.
382719	383681	I haven't seen him in forever.
384001	384281	Yeah.
384442	385403	So, all right.
386104	386545	Anyhow.
388107	389389	Tony Stark's House of Ribs.
390871	412835	Alright, I'm just reading the chat and a salacious pop is just going, wow, I was mean to Jamie, I didn't mean it, come on you guys, I have to razz around the show, I got last week to make up for, come on you guys And your mic sucks, that is not a lie You went to the place without me
413263	413904	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
435184	437647	I was going to play Final Fantasy XIII and didn't.
438547	442991	Dan's been in there with our friend George over here playing Halo Reach all day.
443752	454061	And I played Star Trek Online and I'm doing... I've got actually until tomorrow to finish the other three missions and this whole Breen thing so that I can get my free Breen tactical officer.
455362	458565	Because I have a shit ton of homework to do the rest of the week.
459426	461247	So, busy Jamie is busy.
462910	468123	I played lots of Plants vs. Zombies I played Narbacular Drop which we know what that is, right?
470017	473478	The precursor to Portal.
473839	476540	The game that eventually became Portal.
476620	479101	I'm not any good at it.
479242	481503	It's a neat concept.
483064	486726	But I'm glad that Portal made it less clippy, if you know what I mean.
487906	488967	With fewer trolls in it.
492269	493649	And then, what else did I play?
494250	494330	Um...
497779	498920	Dan's played a whole lot of Mega Man.
528621	530042	Mega Man 4 Game Boy Edition
541643	544925	I think the Mega Man collection on GameCube is still an awesome game to have.
544945	547467	Because you know those GameCubes, you can still play them on the Wii.
548067	549608	So it's still a good collection to have.
549648	551309	Or the PS2, whatever one you want.
551729	554771	Some people don't like the GameCube one because they think the buttons are swapped or something.
555872	556352	But it's fine.
556392	557053	It doesn't bother me.
557153	557713	Either way, it's fine.
558193	559094	You're not bothered, Rob.
559874	559994	No.
560775	564217	And I've been keeping Super Metroid all warm and cozy for you.
564895	566036	I like the long stick
583737	584057	Oh my.
584297	585457	Loki, how was your gaming week?
586598	588058	Um, it was okay.
588198	589058	I didn't play a whole lot.
589298	591659	I played mainly Grand Theft Auto.
593019	595500	You know, more Grand Theft Auto 4, Lost and Damned.
595980	597040	Still playing more multiplayer.
597420	601881	I am really pissing off my coworkers because I keep winning a lot.
602061	611143	And I've actually had to draft up a printed out form letter for apologies for beating them at certain things that I fill out.
612084	612624	So, um...
613544	617965	I don't know if that adds insult to injury or what, but it's what they requested.
618305	619526	I'm sorry that you suck.
620346	624347	It sounds like you had to make your amends to your coworkers.
624547	628168	It's because, okay, the game is so laggy now.
628368	636471	I think they shut down some servers or something when they moved on to a new expansion and Red Dead Redemption, that kind of stuff.
636831	642293	So the game gets a little laggy sometimes, and sometimes things just seem to go my way.
642553	643173	Like, um...
644896	651040	They'll be coming to attack me and all of a sudden a car hits them and they get knocked over and I turn around and shoot them in the face.
654021	659785	My big thing now that I've become fascinated with is climbing up buildings.
659965	664327	I'm totally this massive free runner in that damn game now.
664387	665148	It's ridiculous.
665928	667989	How the fuck did you get on top of that skyscraper?
668029	668890	You're Spider-Man.
669330	671232	Seriously, I'm like Spider-Man in that game.
671312	672112	It's ridiculous.
672893	684523	And there's a lot of places, especially in Algonquin, that you can just climb up to the top of buildings and there's so many fire escapes you can get to and it's ridiculous.
684543	686664	So you had to write your co-workers apology letters?
686865	689507	Were they at the point where, we're not playing with you again because you're a jerk?
689527	691729	They're getting pretty pissed off at me.
691749	692069	Sounds like...
692429	692689	What?
692729	694051	She's walking on sunshine.
715157	715757	and DarkSakura.com.
739923	743026	I'm sorry that I repeatedly beat your ass at Grand Theft Auto and I'm sorry you can't handle it.
760369	761230	Sorry you suck.
762251	770198	It's not necessarily... It's only when really ridiculous things happen that shouldn't happen normally in the circumstances of the game.
770218	771539	I don't know.
771659	772580	Whatever.
773561	777805	Other things I played other than Grand Theft Auto, I did play a little bit of Dead Rising 2.
778626	780788	I really do mean a little bit.
780928	782469	I only got to the part where...
783670	784851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
802113	802834	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
816835	824116	I am digging, though, this one app on there called the Free App Tracker.
824817	829137	And it'll basically track or let you know when apps drop in price to free.
829998	837099	So you can go on there and browse through there and download games that would normally cost you money because they're either trying to promote them or whatever.
837859	838579	So that's kind of cool.
839199	841640	A great way to get a bunch of free shit.
843200	844861	So yeah, that's pretty much what I've been playing.
845141	856205	I'm excited I get a new laptop this week that I'll actually be able to run Grand Theft Auto on it so I can do my editing at work because that's really the only time I'll actually have to do mods for the Xbox 360 version.
857426	858826	Plus I can run other things on there.
859026	863808	And I'm possibly going to download Minecraft now since everybody keeps talking about it and I got to see what this thing is.
863928	868552	I somehow missed the boat on all this Minecraft stuff because it's just really happened in the past couple weeks.
868612	871095	But why is everybody all gung-ho about Minecraft?
871115	874057	I somehow missed this while I was on vacation.
874157	877360	It went free for a while while they were fixing some server issues or something.
877400	879562	And once people started playing, they're like, oh my god, it's addictive.
879622	883646	It's basically a game you go in and you create stuff.
884687	885668	And then there's monsters.
885928	887208	There's a lot of games like that, isn't there?
887329	889709	Well, yeah, but this is really addicting, apparently.
889849	890690	Okay, I'll have to try it.
890750	891730	I mean, don't knock until you try it.
891750	897112	To the point where, like, there's someone, like, recreating the Star Trek Enterprise full scale in the game.
897132	897512	That's cool.
898232	899873	So it's kind of like Lego is but a game.
900393	901033	Something like that.
901153	903774	It's like Lego Universe, but not.
904594	904854	Okay.
904874	906415	We've created a new game in the chat.
906775	907555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
931369	955776	and like wow people really do buy those but you know what actually um I can relate this to Disneyland a little bit um you know I do the pin trading at Disneyland and I always buy like a generic pin set to trade away to people uh to because the employees trade with you and it's this whole little like weird game you play while you're at the parks so I bought a pack of starter pins you know what the pack was that I bought of starter pins Club Penguin and
955916	984451	and like almost all day long people kept asking me like what are those pins what is it and I'm having to like explain Club Penguin to people which is weird because I've never played it but it's one of those like Disney style Farmville-esque MMOs and they sell those cards right next to the Farmville cards at the store but it's more for kids because it's Disney so yeah people actually buy that stuff but I mean the kids stuff I get because the kids stuff you really have to ration I get that a little more but the adult stuff it's like oh boy
985314	987070	Oh boy Um
988644	991166	Yeah, so again, if you want to join us in chat, chat.orangelandrita.com.
991507	993468	Anything else you want to mention about your gaming week, Loki?
993488	994029	Are you all done?
994930	995370	You all done?
995550	995871	I'm done.
996011	996271	All right.
997132	999094	I don't think I have a whole lot for my gaming week.
999114	999674	I got to be honest.
999694	1003117	Since I was out for five days and then I was sick, I didn't do a whole lot of gaming.
1003137	1003858	Just a lot of sleeping.
1004278	1008402	I did play some more World of Warcraft because, you know, I'm a big old... Yeah, shut up.
1008782	1011985	Hey, my guild is nine of 12 now in ICC, finally.
1012005	1012566	We're almost there.
1012586	1013707	Sounds like a Borg designation.
1013787	1014147	Doesn't it?
1015368	1016770	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1031147	1031587	What's that?
1031728	1032408	Your what thing?
1032608	1033008	Breen.
1033569	1033969	What's that?
1034309	1035510	They're a race in Star Trek.
1036371	1039733	Oh, is this like a thing you have to grind a lot to get to play them?
1039893	1040634	No, no.
1041354	1051461	And I'll tell everyone right now who's playing Star Trek Online, they're having a special that if you do the Breen episodes, there's five of them, when you finish the last episode, you get a Breen tactical officer.
1052361	1053282	Only until the 14th.
1053882	1054063	Wow.
1054283	1055203	So that's what I'm doing.
1055343	1056945	Only I've got tomorrow to finish it.
1056965	1057105	Random.
1057125	1057365	Random.
1057725	1060347	I'm sorry, but now I don't feel so bad about my brain.
1060507	1061567	That's all right.
1061607	1063368	There's holiday events in WoW that are just as bad.
1063729	1068852	So yeah, it's mostly been that because I was away for five days and then I was sick and everything, so I haven't been playing a whole lot.
1069132	1074495	Plus, I spent a lot more at Disneyland than I should have, so I've been scaling back in other ways.
1074715	1079058	I was going to get the Castlevania game this week, but I've heard mixed things on it anyway.
1079098	1080598	I've heard it's not so hot.
1081099	1083040	That's the general reaction I've been seeing on Facebook.
1083420	1090446	and I actually resisted buying Final Fantasy XIV which has been getting some really mixed reviews online.
1090466	1090947	Have you seen this?
1090987	1093449	Like some websites, like I think GameSpot gave it a four.
1094009	1094290	Like...
1096502	1097942	But some websites have been giving it like eights.
1098123	1100963	So it's really hit and miss, Final Fantasy XIV.
1101023	1101944	It's interesting.
1103684	1105085	I will talk a little bit briefly then.
1105145	1110106	Some of the games I was able to play since I was at the airport and stuff, I did play quite a few iPhone games.
1110407	1113968	So just really quick, I know not everyone's into this, but I'll mention a couple things I played that came out.
1114528	1116489	Stardunk is totally free.
1116569	1119189	It's this basketball-y kind of game, but not really.
1119209	1122731	I don't want you to think it's like an NBA-type game, because it's not.
1122791	1123071	It's like...
1124111	1127294	It reminds me a little more of those old school tank shooting games.
1127314	1130096	Because you kind of use your finger to pick an angle and a power.
1130596	1134659	And then you just try to fire a ball in the basket as many times as you can.
1134699	1136080	But the ball keeps moving around the screen.
1136481	1139223	And it's like online and all this Uber stuff with it.
1139263	1139843	So it's pretty cool.
1140203	1141885	Bit Trip Beat came out on the iPhone.
1141925	1142725	This game will set you back $5.
1144647	1148550	That's a little much, I think, considering there are so many games out there that are $0.99 and free.
1148630	1150852	I talked about this last week because I actually played it last week.
1150872	1151352	Oh, did you?
1151372	1151752	What did you think?
1151772	1152353	I dislike...
1153133	1155756	I never really cared for the Wii controls.
1155896	1160720	You know how you had to tilt the remote to get your little paddle to go back and forth?
1161201	1164384	And I really don't like it on the iPod or iPhone.
1164724	1170629	I'd rather use my finger to move it up and down because that would be a lot more accurate.
1170709	1173192	But you can't, and it's annoying.
1173732	1175613	I mean, the tilt thing was fine for me.
1176113	1176874	I enjoyed it.
1176994	1184217	I still think it's a good game, and it's weird that I'll pay $10 on it on the Wii, but then I sit here and go, but $5 on the iPhone is too much.
1184557	1191941	But I think we just get accustomed to these different pricing things when there's so many games out on the iPhone that are free or $3 or less.
1191961	1195903	Your game has to be really good to justify a $5 or even $10 premium.
1195923	1197524	With Sonic 4, they want $9.99 for that, right?
1197544	1197724	Okay.
1201553	1202994	No, I am not paying that much.
1203014	1205236	But would you pay $15 for it on the PS3?
1205356	1205896	No, I wouldn't.
1206196	1206757	Oh, okay.
1207717	1208018	I wouldn't.
1209419	1210619	And why is that, Loki?
1210699	1211380	Why is that?
1211440	1211960	Why is that?
1211980	1214082	Because I've played it, and it's terrible.
1214582	1215003	Really?
1215503	1216524	Yeah, I do not like it.
1216544	1217504	I haven't played it at E3 enough.
1217584	1218025	It was fine.
1218065	1218665	Here's the thing, though.
1219045	1223248	I'm not a real big fan of Sonic games, so maybe that's not for me to judge.
1223769	1230934	Personally, I think games like Sonic Colors or the good parts of Sonic Unleashed actually seem more interesting to me.
1232394	1232555	Weird.
1232575	1232815	Weird.
1257145	1258687	And I know we'll get into stuff later.
1259047	1262270	I'm not sure if the story... Yeah, there's some Sonic 4 stuff on the show later.
1262790	1264112	And that's ridiculous.
1264993	1265493	I'm sorry.
1265813	1266754	We'll get there when we get there.
1266814	1267095	Sorry.
1267695	1270218	I do think it's interesting, though, that it came out on the iPhone first.
1270358	1275362	I'm sure you guys have heard Sonic 4 is out on the iPhone now, and it's not out on consoles until this week, right?
1275442	1279206	I'll probably buy it on consoles anyway, just because I'm a consumer whore.
1279266	1280347	Yay!
1281088	1282069	And how, exactly.
1282389	1285490	Well, if you like the old school Sonic games, then you'll probably like it.
1285710	1288671	I didn't care for the old... I like Sonic 1, that was alright.
1288931	1294293	And Sonic & Knuckles was kind of fun, but... I don't know, I just don't like Sonic too much.
1294913	1299014	The Dreamcast one recently came out on the 360 as well, and I did play that a little bit a couple weeks ago.
1299034	1300915	And apparently that was a terrible port as well.
1301135	1301755	It was okay.
1302675	1303555	Actually, I know, I take that back.
1303595	1304396	It wasn't terrible.
1304496	1306276	It isn't the same game to me at all.
1306656	1308277	It's just not the same game to me at all.
1308757	1311358	Well, like, people are complaining about, like, graphics and stuff in there.
1311398	1312898	I'm like, it's a Dreamcast game.
1312918	1313858	What do you expect?
1313878	1315059	I mean, come on.
1315359	1327241	Because you're taking a game that you remember from your tiny TV in your bedroom that was hooked up with the RCA red, yellow, white cables or maybe even, like, the RF adapters.
1327541	1330202	Like, you know, minimal graphical ability for this day and age.
1330502	1332583	And now you're putting it on your HDTV.
1332643	1338284	Well, every flaw you're gonna see now and every rough polygon that was smooth before because the old TVs weren't
1338604	1339545	as Crisp.
1339706	1342069	And your expectations back then were way lower.
1342089	1349939	Remember when the Nintendo 64 stuff came out and hell, even before that, you know, just even some of the
1351625	1352166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1375803	1376684	Thanks for watching!
1394375	1400299	What Capcom's planning on doing with the iPhone stuff, they're planning on doing something like Game Room, but with the Capcom games.
1400379	1400880	Oh, interesting.
1401700	1403622	As long as Quiz and Dragons is in there, I'm game.
1403942	1404282	Probably.
1404322	1406504	Quiz and Dragons was awesome.
1406684	1410006	It ran on the same hardware as, it was either CPS 1 or 2, I can't remember.
1410026	1411287	What's the one that Street Fighter 2's on?
1411627	1413188	Street Fighter 2 is CPS 2.
1414109	1416250	Okay, Quiz and Dragons was on that.
1416270	1418932	It was Magic Sword, Final Fight, they were all on that same engine.
1419353	1420273	Quiz and Dragons was awesome.
1420754	1421114	Just saying.
1421354	1421654	Look it up.
1422354	1422594	All right.
1422654	1426416	Anyhow, I think I need to bribe DarkSakura to make that a classic game of the week at some point.
1426716	1427016	Which one?
1427036	1427396	Just saying.
1427456	1428296	Quiz and Dragons.
1428636	1429376	You know, I never played it.
1429737	1430017	Really?
1430457	1430637	Yeah.
1430777	1431177	It's neat.
1432197	1433478	It's in one of those Capcom collections.
1434138	1436559	It's hard now because all the trivia questions are like from 92.
1436979	1440380	Who is president now?
1440400	1441440	It's like, oh, no.
1441520	1442400	I think it was Clinton.
1442460	1442760	Was it?
1443341	1443641	All right.
1444061	1444341	Anyhow.
1446224	1448385	Let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into some actual news.
1448926	1450527	What are you doing, DarkSakura?
1450547	1452249	I was looking at Minecraft.
1452329	1453150	It looks irritating.
1453641	1457123	It looks like an old school Doom, make your own Doom type of thing.
1457923	1464207	See, that right there is what I imagine ZZT would look like if they did it nowadays.
1464227	1465288	Oh, now you just sold me this.
1465388	1466308	Is this like ZZT?
1466348	1467409	Is this like a new ZZT?
1468229	1474633	You basically can dig and you can harvest stuff and you can create objects.
1475934	1476994	You can dig holes.
1477234	1477474	Yeah.
1478735	1479476	You can dig holes.
1479616	1480618	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1480678	1481819	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
1482079	1482860	Jamie, pick up your mic.
1483041	1483822	I don't understand.
1483922	1484783	It's just fucking holes.
1484803	1489409	But you will sit there and play The Sims for God knows how long, but this is just fucking holes?
1490931	1492072	I'm not playing Dress Up!
1494415	1494895	But, okay.
1495055	1495596	I don't get it.
1495636	1498798	You can basically... Look at the videos on YouTube and stuff.
1498858	1501839	You can create houses and stuff and forts.
1502300	1507963	And later on, not to spoil anything, there's monsters... Wait, this is a closed page.
1508663	1517128	There's monsters that come that you have to defend your little house or castle or whatever the hell you decide to make in it.
1519298	1521521	and you can get torches that keep the evil things away.
1521942	1533380	It's like, it's a whole big, you know, it's almost like a little bit of tower defense with a little bit of, like, crafting and MMO with a little bit of, like, little big planet, you know,
1535618	1536378	It's a little of everything.
1536439	1541501	It's just people like it because they can be extremely creative in it, and it's one of those games that never really ends.
1542382	1542562	All right.
1543122	1544403	Chat.orange.radio.com.
1544443	1545023	Lots of comments.
1545083	1550707	Tiger Claw says, and many of the Atari 2600 games are two-player online and no ability to play with others online with it.
1551227	1551687	I agree.
1551967	1557411	Game Room has huge flaws, and that's why it's not doing as well as you would think it would, and that's one of them.
1557551	1559192	And it's very, very sad because...
1560232	1568780	Now nobody's going to attempt it again this generation, and that makes me very sad that they had such a great idea and then kind of made these few key decisions that just kind of ruin it.
1569040	1569500	Boo-hiss.
1570501	1570822	Let's see.
1570862	1574445	SalaciousPop says, Minecraft is item creation heaven hell.
1574785	1578548	You dig, you build, you explore, you defend, you resource farm forever.
1579009	1579449	Forever!
1581291	1584894	Chat.OrangeLondrina.com if you want to join us on this lovely Sunday evening.
1586334	1588855	While I get into some housekeeping, I didn't even mention it is 10, 10, 10.
1590776	1588855	42.
1590816	1591496	So happy.
1591777	1593637	Do you know how many people I know that got married today?
1594278	1596479	Today was a huge wedding day because of the day.
1596879	1598219	And I'm going to a wedding next weekend.
1598480	1600020	Bobby was off tonight because of a wedding.
1600360	1600981	Why?
1601121	1602061	It's so stupid.
1603282	1604422	So you can remember your anniversary?
1604442	1605443	That's what women want.
1605583	1608404	Women want days that are cute, right?
1608644	1609645	No, not me.
1609985	1612346	I was like, September 1st, that works for me.
1612566	1612986	Pee Wee Herman
1635208	1638490	Spazinator in our chatroom says, I still love Game Room despite its faults.
1638811	1646016	You know, that's kind of where I'm at, too, is that, you know, despite its faults, I do love the retro goodness that it brings out.
1646076	1647277	So it's like you have to love it.
1647357	1651400	Although, boy, they're really reaching now with some of these games they're putting out.
1651560	1652301	They're running out.
1652581	1654823	I don't think they were able to bring any other publishers on board.
1654863	1655523	That's kind of sad.
1656904	1657304	Let's see.
1657985	1659206	Oh, and people are reminding me.
1659506	1662028	Act F says 42 equals life, universe, and everything.
1662048	1663809	That's right, because 10, 10, 10 in binary is 42.
1664870	1665631	Which is the answer?
1667052	1669274	Some of you guys need to really get over the numerology thing.
1669314	1669734	I'm just saying.
1669774	1670095	No, no, no.
1670195	1671396	It has nothing to do with numerology.
1671996	1673197	Didn't you ever read Hitchhiker's Guide?
1675379	1677221	Like bits and pieces, but never the whole thing.
1677241	1679182	Okay, I will explain this in a nutshell.
1679222	1684587	The Earth was created to be a supercomputer to figure out the meaning of life or the answer to life or something.
1685187	1687729	And before it got destroyed, it only got as far as 42.
1687850	1688030	Okay.
1689696	1690116	Interesting.
1690176	1691177	So 42 is the answer.
1691197	1693858	So on the 42nd day, God rest it or whatever?
1694318	1694438	It's 42.
1694738	1695499	All right, fine.
1697600	1698000	Let's see.
1699020	1699921	So happy 10-10-10.

1711886	1713167	Blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.
1713207	1714408	Let's get into some actual gaming news.
1714428	1715829	We're only, what, 30 minutes into the show?
1715949	1716690	Need some gaming news?
1716910	1717670	Just a tad.
1717730	1718311	Just a little bit.
1718371	1719732	Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?
1720092	1721373	Well, lots of stuff.
1721453	1730580	In fact, there's a new, I guess you would call it a handheld console that's coming from somebody that used to be in the console business and is not anymore.
1731421	1732942	Panasonic.
1733522	1735284	You may remember them for the 3DO.
1735564	1741008	Then again, maybe you don't remember them for the 3DO because it wasn't that great.
1741868	1770482	um well now they have a wait was that the system with the terrible like Zelda and Mario knockoff games was that the 3DO or was it the CDI I always get those two mixed up cause they were they were right around the same time the 3DO had like some of the old um 3DO had Mega Race right did it um it may have had Mega Race it had I remember I played um You Don't Know Jack on the 3DO and I also played um Road Rash on the 3DO Road Rash is cool maybe Road Rash is what I was thinking of not Mega Race
1771273	1773155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1790991	1795552	Apparently, they're gearing it for MMOs.
1796833	1805655	The thing runs Linux, so it's obviously going to be able to run other things, but honestly, I don't know many MMOs that run natively in Linux.
1807136	1814098	So, it's nice that you made a console for MMOs that don't yet really exist for the console.
1816417	1819239	Well, but they get a lot of stuff to run on Linux.
1819279	1820339	Does WoW run on Linux?
1820679	1821320	I don't think it does.
1821360	1822440	I think it's just PC and Mac.
1822521	1826063	Like, I know Blizzard's very... People have gotten to run in the GNOME.
1826543	1828964	I mean, not the GNOME, whatever the virtual environment is.
1829424	1829705	Wine.
1831105	1831726	Interesting.
1831946	1838009	It also comes with a mini HDMI port, a mini USB port, headphone jack, of course.
1838610	1840391	It is kind of thick-looking.
1841691	1843552	People say it looks kind of like the N-Gage.
1844153	1845874	I don't know if I'd compare it to the N-Gage.
1846994	1862081	Um, and funny enough, they, uh, unveiled it on the MTV show to which this, at this point I was unaware of, uh, Rob, looks like, uh, Rob, uh, Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory.
1863849	1866111	Yeah, I don't know anything about that show.
1866511	1866931	Wow.
1867251	1867552	Yeah.
1868492	1871454	It's a long way from downtown Julia Brown, that's all I'm saying.
1871534	1880720	I guess along with the system, Panasonic is launching a Battlestar Galactica title for the device and a web show called Online Underground.
1881541	1885503	I wonder if it's that same Battlestar Galactica MMO I saw at E3, because that looked kind of neat.
1886244	1886584	I don't know.
1888285	1888866	It looks neat.
1888966	1889186	I mean...
1891016	1898962	If it actually supported MMOs or something to the point where it would be able to run them without any sort of lag or something, that might not be bad.
1899342	1905206	I could see this almost as something that you could, say, for example, stream something, kind of like the on-live stuff.
1905627	1912932	Maybe have this portable device with you, it connects to the web, and you can stream, say, something from your PC so you can play an MMO on it or something.
1913132	1913853	Yes, you can.
1939932	1940732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1965222	1993253	they have enabled that on all games but the thing is it really comes down to it comes down to the control set whether the control set will work with what's limited on the PSP but yeah anything is possible with the PS3 you can play any of the PS3 games on the PSP and I bet most people don't even know that type of functionality exists because Sony would rather market these other features that you know
1993669	1993849	Yeah.
1994830	1995811	But I don't know.
1996151	2002716	When I hear of this thing and I see this thing and you describing it, I don't think of this as like a handheld gaming device in a way.
2002796	2003696	It's pretty large.
2003716	2006979	Well, I file this under the iPad competitor department.
2007099	2015805	I mean, to me, yeah, it doesn't have a touchscreen or anything, but it seems more iPad-esque where it's more of like a computer that runs Linux.
2016126	2019948	Because if it runs Linux, then who's to say I can just run MMOs on it?
2020048	2021470	I mean, couldn't I do spreadsheets on it?
2022190	2022891	It's possible.
2023151	2023431	Right?
2023651	2025553	So it's more of a computer than a gaming device.
2026514	2030236	I guess it's all in the way they're marketing it, maybe, but it just seems strange to me.
2030256	2033299	Well, didn't Sony try to play off the PS3 as a computer?
2034861	2041825	Yeah, but I don't know that was different because it's not like... Well, but you could run Linux on the PS3 at least for a limited time.
2041845	2043386	You can't anymore.
2044587	2048169	But I don't think... I don't know how many people really use that feature.
2048469	2053732	I mean, when they took it out, certainly there was that core group of hackers and folks that were very upset.
2054093	2060677	And then what the military had been using it or something is the processors and those things are disgustingly fast.
2060697	2062638	So it's kind of like a really cheap supercomputer, but...
2063398	2068102	Most people didn't get a PS3 to run Linux on it.
2068383	2069183	Most people didn't.
2069203	2071045	Most people got it to be a cheap Blu-ray player.
2073887	2074608	I see it anyway.
2075108	2075308	Yeah.
2076730	2077030	All right.
2077350	2082154	Well, speaking of MMOs, whether this one will run on this device or not, I don't know.
2082534	2088579	But the biggest one, World of Warcraft, at least here in the U.S., has a release date for its next expansion.
2088620	2090221	That's right, the Cataclysm expansion.
2090561	2092801	will be starting on December 7th.
2092862	2096042	That's when World of Warcraft Cataclysm will hit stores.
2096122	2097763	It's going to be $40 when it comes out.
2098023	2108425	There will be a collector's edition for $80 that comes with an art book, commentary DVD, soundtrack CD, mouse pad, trading cards, and a little in-game pet called Lil' Deathwing.
2109045	2118767	So you can go out and run out and buy that in stores or, and I find this very interesting, we all kind of saw this coming after StarCraft II, they will be doing digital download with this.
2119887	2131917	That strikes me as kind of amazing because they're not going to have those awesome media opportunities of folks lining up outside of stores and all that unless I guess they're just getting the collector's edition.
2132257	2139643	People are pissed off that those collector's editions are really rare right now.
2139663	2142025	Well, it's kind of like any of the other expansions.
2144688	2155869	It's just interesting to me that they're going to go ahead and go the digital distribution route, and I don't know, it seems a little bit controversial, but Blizzard and the PC market can also kind of get away with doing whatever it wants right now, so...
2156468	2157709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2183928	2185729	And then they, what, moved it around a bunch?
2185789	2186309	No, no, no.
2186429	2187250	They hinted at it.
2187310	2189571	You said on the show it was going to be November, like a couple weeks ago.
2189591	2194053	Well, that's what I'm saying that they said, and that's compared to what they've released in the past.
2194393	2198956	But apparently, no, it was, they were saying, there was some comment that they made.
2199856	2206119	It was either an interview or something where they're like, yeah, there's a 12.7% chance of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2206719	2211522	And, you know, it was kind of a little hint that they threw out that no one caught until...
2212623	2218048	Like I'm saying, they could put this game out on Christmas Eve and people would still be lining up to get it.
2218128	2219229	I mean, it just doesn't matter.
2219830	2221111	It's that kind of game.
2221672	2222473	Same thing with Diablo 3.
2223293	2226597	If they wanted to release Diablo 3 on Thanksgiving, they could do it.
2228731	2229131	Let's see.
2229772	2234534	Looking at comments from chat.orangeontraday.com ToyGak in our chatroom says, I hate digital distribution.
2234614	2235715	Hard media forever.
2236715	2237876	Maybe physical media?
2237936	2239917	I don't know.
2240277	2244659	I know neither of you really play WoW, but let's say this was an expansion to a game you do really like.
2244899	2256385	Let's say DarkSakura was a Star Trek Online second edition or something, and I don't know, for Loki, Grand Theft Auto V. Would you bypass the store completely in favor of digital distribution?
2256885	2257005	No.
2257025	2257065	No.
2258137	2258698	DarkSakura.com
2279258	2282982	Although I have been known in the past to go the digital route to get it slightly early.
2284384	2284864	Alright, alright.
2284904	2286866	And then buy a physical copy later on.
2286906	2289029	Like when I couldn't find all my WoW stuff, I downloaded it.
2290190	2291111	When I would try to play again.
2293063	2318376	Boshka in our chatroom says collector's edition is barely worth it $40 for a pet, no thanks a lot of collector's editions just have a CD and a book and all that a lot of collector's editions nowadays to me it seems like they're not worth it anymore like I used to buy collector's editions for different things like Bioshock and Saints Row 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4 and stuff like that it's just a bunch of crap that they throw in there I mean
2319657	2320499	Thank you for watching!
2336121	2338824	Frisbee in our chat says, but does it come with a plate and a spoon?
2339304	2342968	Kind of in a reference to that Dreamcast game that DarkSakura has.
2343468	2350975	DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says, my biggest issue with digital distro is if something happens to my computer, if I can re-download it, I would do digital.
2351255	2352997	You know, that's something that Blizzard's pretty good about, though.
2353097	2358142	I mean, even if you have these games from way before there was ever digital distribution, like, for instance...
2358462	2379142	I see Dan up there in his collection has a Warcraft 3 game and there's a serial number on that if he goes to battle.net and enters in that serial number it'll get attached to his account and he could always redownload Warcraft 3 wherever he's at so it's kind of you know that is one thing Blizzard's pretty good about is that once you do have the game tied to your account you could always redownload it anywhere kind of interesting so
2380483	2383725	Anyhow, one other quick note here on World of Warcraft.
2383765	2389548	It was also announced by Blizzard this week that they have surpassed the 12 million subscriber mark.
2389928	2393070	That's right, there are now 12 million subscribers for World of Warcraft.
2393411	2395432	Keep in mind that's not just in the US.
2395592	2401856	This is partially attributed to the fact that Wrath of the Lich King finally came out in mainland China just about a month ago.
2402376	2405878	And of course, Cataclysm is coming out here soon, so everybody's getting ready for that.
2406339	2406499	So...
2407179	2407599	Who knows?
2408780	2409980	Yeah, this is interesting.
2410000	2417722	The last time there was a big population increase announcement was December 2008 when it got to 11.5 million.
2417762	2420823	So a lot of folks at that time thought, oh, wow, it's topped off, it's dying.
2421283	2423324	But nope, they got up to 12 million this week.
2423384	2428106	But probably not likely to ever get as high as 20 million as some people thought it once would.
2428586	2431287	There's 20 million people living in Australia, just so you know.
2433127	2434087	Come on, Australia.
2435088	2435568	What's the holdup?
2436991	2439373	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2459341	2460162	Some more stuff.
2460602	2461442	Oh, I love stuff.
2461543	2462683	How about DC Universe?
2462923	2465005	Yay, I'm really looking forward to DC Universe Online.
2465225	2466466	Well, you gotta wait.
2467306	2468967	No.
2468987	2471089	It's been delayed until spring 2010.
2471129	2471169	No.
2471269	2474031	Wait, spring 2010, then it's already out.
2474071	2474031	11.
2474091	2474191	No.
2474211	2474771	Which means that...
2484269	2485029	It's going to be a while.
2485109	2489130	However, the beta is going to be available in November.
2489810	2498933	That will be, if you pre-order the game, then you are guaranteed access to the November 30th beta.
2501253	2504714	You have to pre-order before November 15th to make it into the beta.
2505234	2510715	So you can still get the game in November, you just have to pre-order the game to play the test game?
2511016	2511236	Yes.
2512456	2512656	Okay.
2512676	2512756	Okay.
2514588	2516150	Are they going to pay me to be a tester?
2516190	2517791	Because I'm doing their job, right?
2517811	2518372	Of course not.
2519693	2521635	I'm still very excited about DC Universe Online.
2521935	2529343	I'm sad to hear it's getting delayed, but at the same time, there was another big MMO that came out very recently that I said should probably be delayed until 2011.
2529383	2530144	But boy, did they listen.
2530164	2531745	Yeah, boy, did they listen.
2533807	2534247	So you know what?
2534327	2537589	If that's what this game has to do to take the time to get it right, then you know what?
2538329	2539730	So be it.
2539770	2541190	It's okay, Rob.
2541210	2543211	They can always just patch it later on.
2543231	2543911	That's right.
2544272	2545312	It's an MMO.
2545372	2546533	It doesn't need to be finished.
2548253	2548713	Finish?
2548774	2549734	It's never finished.
2549794	2550614	It's an MMO.
2550694	2551855	We're always adding stuff.
2551975	2552995	I mean, fixing things.
2553095	2554336	I mean, making it not shitty.
2556428	2558669	Tiger Claw sharing a new sound effect for us.
2559150	2567174	I guess this is the sister to sad trombone to play when we have depressing stories like DC Universe Online is delayed until spring 2011.
2567354	2571116	Oh, that's not a new one.
2571136	2573177	This is called sadtuba.com.
2574237	2576178	It's not a sad tuba.
2576218	2577419	The price is right losing horn.
2580702	2583088	I thought it was going to be the sad trombone thing played on a tuba.
2583549	2584251	So I thought it would be.
2585554	2585935	Whatever.
2587816	2589957	That's the craziest, dorkiest thing I've ever heard.
2590017	2590537	Yeah, I know.
2590837	2591077	I know.
2591857	2595398	Anyhow, let's move on quickly before I embarrass myself again.
2595678	2598499	Yeah, so this is kind of neat.
2599119	2603640	OnLive apparently is ditching the monthly charge and they're going free.
2605421	2608062	And apparently they're also working on... Well, they did talk about this.
2608082	2612763	They're working on a mini streaming console that's supposed to be manufactured soon.
2613103	2627415	Apparently, the former $14.95 per month service, which was through its founding members program, they have offered now a year of free service.
2627535	2633060	Apparently, they're also going to be offering a bunch of free demos and stuff to check out.
2634381	2636723	I think that the free service is not free forever.
2636763	2637444	I think it's just...
2639105	2640586	You know, like a trial type thing.
2641267	2649873	And you can basically create an account with no monthly cost, no credit card needed for sign up, and lots of free stuff to play.
2651274	2654756	And then the micro console, it's going to be like kind of a streaming box.
2654836	2660600	Think of like a sling box or something like that with a controller built in and you can basically plug it into a TV.
2660640	2665964	I guess it almost looks like maybe like an Apple TV or something like that.
2667509	2668029	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2691830	2695933	Well, I mean, that was certainly a drawback to OnLive was this whole monthly fee.
2696033	2696754	Like, really?
2696774	2699396	You're going to pay me a monthly fee to buy games?
2699916	2701157	Seems a little strange.
2701558	2705000	It's like you're having to join... I'd like someone to pay me a monthly fee to buy games.
2705621	2710085	No, I thought that the monthly fee was just to play whatever on their service.
2710285	2712607	No, no, no.
2712647	2714989	You still have to rent the games or buy the games.
2715369	2720093	And even when you buy them, it's only guaranteed for three years because you're playing on someone else's computer.
2720593	2725017	So if the service ever gets shut down in three years or whatever, then it's gone.
2725537	2736847	So it's still a little bit iffy, but if you're the type that just wants to rent games or check out the game demos, which certainly is useful, then it might be worth it.
2736927	2739029	I still need to sign up and check it out.
2739489	2742552	I would like to make use of the game rental part.
2742612	2747356	I think the whole free demo thing might be kind of cool because, say, for example...
2748477	2767499	you know you want to play like one of the new games that's coming out recently or very soon or something like that and they have a demo for it you don't want to spend time downloading i mean because some of these demos out there are you know a few gigs in the download that it might take a very long time and then you have to install it and that takes more time this you can just
2768291	2768851	Play it and go.
2769472	2770212	Oh, don't like it?
2770292	2770993	Go to the next one.
2771613	2777557	No need to download, install, worry about doing all that stuff.
2777957	2779659	Just kind of play it as you go.
2780019	2780239	Yeah.
2781300	2783881	And plus you could have a crappy computer and it still plays.
2783981	2788585	And that would be kind of cool to do with, say, an Xbox 360 or something like that.
2789045	2790706	So I don't have to download the demo.
2790786	2792907	I can just, boom, play the demo instantly.
2793708	2797430	I bet that's going to be a big feature in the next generation of consoles.
2798631	2798952	Maybe.
2800353	2803116	I said a while ago that this is the games analyst in me.
2803917	2807701	One of them, probably PlayStation, is going to be ballsy enough to try and go all digital.
2807861	2809323	Just cut out the physical media completely.
2810364	2812046	That worked so well for them in the past.
2812907	2813067	Well...
2814119	2815741	I think it'll be different.
2815802	2824454	The problem with the PSP Go is that it was really more money for the removal of a future.
2824915	2828600	But if they had charged $99 for that thing, it would have done great.
2830282	2831083	That's the difference.
2832324	2832544	So.
2833344	2837507	Well, with the PSP2 being announced next year, I'm sure we'll see what's coming.
2838748	2839428	Well, we will.
2840729	2843852	One thing we know is coming very soon is NBA Jam.
2843912	2846694	And apparently lots of interesting stuff going on with NBA Jam.
2846994	2855059	I don't know if this was covered last week or if it was this week or what, but NBA Jam, I guess, ended up getting split off from the NBA game on the 360 and the PS3, right?
2855279	2855540	Yeah.
2855580	2857901	So now it's coming out as a standalone game.
2857961	2858702	So that's kind of interesting.
2858722	2858842	Yeah.
2859142	2867165	and one thing we wanted to see in NBA Jam would be hidden characters because you know the old school NBA Jam was awesome because it had what?
2867225	2872986	It had like Scorpion and some of the Mortal Kombat characters and I think Bill Clinton was in there somewhere, right?
2873066	2873286	Oh yeah.
2873627	2878028	Well, apparently this new NBA Jam is keeping with the political ha-ha's
2878608	2904076	and you can actually unlock Obama and Sarah Palin as playable characters so yeah there are it's out on the Wii now so you can check it out and there's actually some codes have already been found on how to unlock certain things I guess you can get some furries and everything wow yeah I'm trying to look at some of the things you can unlock here yeah it looks like you can unlock some of the mascots there
2905106	2905206	Oh.
2906667	2909188	Yeah, they have the mascots available in the old ones too.
2909308	2909928	A furry dream.
2910228	2912189	You can have Bush and Chaney on your team.
2912929	2913249	Why?
2914410	2916491	Because you want them to play basketball.
2916511	2918452	Because Bush has mad hoop skills, of course.
2919032	2919592	There you go.
2920632	2922253	So I'm trying to look up some of these codes.
2922313	2923954	Where are they?
2924774	2925154	Ah, there we go.
2925414	2927275	You can unlock the Beastie Boys as a team.
2927495	2927795	Yeah.
2927875	2928476	It sounds like.
2929436	2929816	Wow.
2930537	2932177	There's actually a lot of hidden people in this.
2933198	2933798	That's kind of cool.
2935159	2936600	ManuteBowl is hidden in there.
2937280	2937901	Good times.
2940142	2946026	I was going to say, I don't know if you heard about how close NBA Elite was to being released.
2946426	2955893	I mean, to the point where an actual retail copy of it leaked out like a disc because I guess they sent them to retailers and then the retailers had to send them back.
2956693	2957074	Oh, wow.
2958134	2965600	And apparently, according to the person that bought one of the retail copies off eBay, the game was really buggy and really fucking terrible.
2966041	2969864	Like, just all sorts of glitches and bad stuff in there.
2971085	2974467	And then, of course, they had NBA Jam on the PS3 with that.
2975949	2983595	And apparently that was... They have, I guess, some of the features that they're talking about adding in now were actually going to be download content in there.
2984335	2986115	So they're saying, oh yeah, it's not done yet.
2986135	2988496	We're adding remix mode or whatever to the game.
2988816	2990796	Well, actually, we're going to release it anyways.
2990836	2995557	You just, now you're not spending extra money for it or something.
2996677	3002738	TigerClaw sent me a link in our chatroom at chat.orangemonster.com and I remember seeing this earlier this week and kind of like rolling my eyes.
3003138	3009439	It's one of these stories about when people who don't play games talk about games.
3010039	3010159	Oh.
3010499	3011540	Yeah, did you hear about this?
3012060	3013400	This is on Fox News.
3015353	3018535	facing off against President Obama in basketball.
3019156	3021077	Not on some court in Washington or Wasilla.
3021157	3025040	It's the new Nintendo Wii version of the video game NBA Jam.
3025240	3026501	And I apologize, this is quiet.
3026541	3031624	Head-to-head competition shooting hoops along with a host of high-profile politicians.
3032144	3033165	Peter Moore is president.
3033225	3037188	Anyway, they go on to wonder if they're going to make a bipartisan game and all this stuff.
3037208	3038188	I'm just like, really?
3038469	3038969	Come on.
3040690	3041010	Anyhow.
3041671	3044032	Because Obama had some sort of super move and the rest didn't.
3046555	3048677	So that's unfair.
3048917	3050940	Well, he's the president and the rest aren't.
3051420	3053483	I mean, it's really quite that simple, right?
3054545	3055306	In theory, right?
3055706	3055846	Ugh.
3056727	3057107	Anyhow.
3057568	3057828	Rob.
3058128	3058368	What?
3058428	3059629	How about something a little different?
3059749	3061190	How about something a little different?
3061371	3062471	More about the Wii.
3063092	3064793	Well, we just had a story on the Wii.
3065054	3066475	But this is about Capcom.
3066735	3068596	Oh, okay.
3068716	3072800	There's going to be some more downloads coming out for Virtual Console.
3072840	3078564	Of course, this is particularly for the UK release.
3080046	3081307	There is going to be...
3084288	3086769	Ghosts and Goblins, which we love in this house.
3087690	3089430	And 1942 will be available.
3090230	3096052	Also, Black Dragon, which is a little obscure.
3097633	3102475	They said they don't have a date yet on them, but they're going to be 800 points apiece.
3102795	3108597	And also other ones that were recently announced were Commando, Son Son, and...
3109597	3113623	XX, so X-Dexis, XX.
3114043	3115044	Where's Quiz and Dragons?
3115205	3118128	I've been asking since the top of the show, where's my Quiz and Dragons?
3118829	3119490	Is that on the list?
3120011	3120211	No.
3121933	3123916	Alas, no, Rob, it is not on the list.
3124079	3124179	Pingo!
3146007	3147328	Pingo was a Sega game, wasn't it?
3147348	3148229	That was Sega.
3148569	3150690	I was just thinking of more obscurity.
3151231	3151711	There you go.
3152872	3153312	I like this.
3153972	3157134	There's a little bit of delay between when we talk and when the chat room gets it.
3157174	3159296	So the chat room is commenting on the whole Fox News thing.
3159676	3162358	Chat.orangehunchradio.com This is a good joke.
3163259	3166100	They're talking about how Obama gets the special move.
3166120	3167121	The Republicans have nothing.
3167421	3170663	Hitstun goes, but all the Republicans have an 8 in steel.
3171724	3172104	Get it?
3172845	3173826	It's a political joke.
3174106	3175667	Come on, come on.
3176447	3179768	Come on, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, that's kind of funny.
3179988	3183529	I want Abraham Lincoln to be in NBA Jam.
3183669	3185529	I think they should do an all-presidential one.
3185569	3186929	That'd be awesome.
3187589	3189150	And why leave it to just U.S.
3189430	3189850	presidents?
3189910	3191750	Why not do some royalty as well?
3191770	3192551	Margaret Thatcher!
3192631	3197432	That's right, get Margaret Thatcher, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Gaga while we're at it.
3197472	3198472	Should definitely be on a team.
3198532	3199292	I'm really surprised.
3199292	3199713	DarkSakura.com
3216573	3218595	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3235874	3236414	and Chuck Norris.
3258413	3260293	Well, we have a list list coming up.
3260333	3261734	I don't think we're going to end up doing it tonight.
3261754	3264334	I think we'll roll it over to next week when we actually have a special guest here.
3264354	3268935	But we're actually going to do a list list on character I most want to see in NBA Jam.
3269495	3270455	So you can look forward to that.
3270935	3272315	We'll probably end up doing that next week.
3272355	3275396	I think we're going to table that to next week because we didn't end up having a fourth person here tonight.
3275676	3276676	We are going to have a guest next week.
3276696	3281417	I'll talk more about that a little later on in the show because it's very exciting for very exciting reasons.
3281777	3283958	It's going to be retrotastic next week and I'll tell you why.
3283978	3285118	Exciting guest is exciting.
3285158	3286278	A little later on in the show.
3287155	3293178	In the meantime, let's go and travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming soon to a store near you, Loki.
3294459	3295799	Yes, lots of good stuff actually.
3297680	3299461	Because we're knee deep in releases this week.
3301182	3308005	Starting off, of course, the big one, Medal of Honor on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3309326	3311107	Arcania Gothic 4.
3313311	3314231	Super Scribblenauts Sledge Shred
3338422	3338843	DarkSakura,
3354847	3357409	But this is a terrible game, and it's on the Wii.
3358630	3359510	Other fun stuff.
3359570	3360031	Let's see.
3360971	3364594	Disney Sing It Party hits on the Wii and PS3.
3365775	3370178	Zuzu Pets, Kung Zu on Nintendo DS and Wii.
3372319	3373280	Or maybe just on the DS.
3374521	3376703	Vampire Moon, The Mystery of the Hidden Sun.
3376763	3378784	It's another adventure game on Nintendo DS.
3379705	3379825	Um...
3381328	3383652	You know, Frisbee in our chatroom asked a damn good question.
3383752	3385274	Is Deal or No Deal still on?
3385395	3385975	I don't think it is.
3386116	3388079	Like, the syndicated one got canned this year, didn't it?
3389060	3389561	I don't know.
3389802	3390883	You know what's coming back, though?
3390903	3392225	Because I read game show blogs.
3393067	3393608	One versus a...
3394881	3400846	I think Deal or No Deal is still on the air because now they're doing the stupid thing where it's like the actual contestants are opening the cases.
3400866	3402347	They couldn't afford to pay the models anymore.
3402367	3403728	No, that was the syndicated one.
3403748	3404728	I don't think that's on the air anymore.
3404829	3408912	I think that went off the air to make room for this year's batch of judge shows and all that.
3409332	3414376	But no, I will say 1 vs. 100 is officially coming back to Game Show Network and it has a new host.
3414416	3415657	It's not going to be Bob Saget.
3415957	3416637	You ready for this?
3417958	3418759	Guess who's hosting 1 vs. 100 now?
3420260	3424982	Arsino Hall tested for it, but no, they passed over Arsino Hall for... Ready?
3425383	3426503	Get your groaning noises ready.
3426523	3428004	Oh wait, let me get SadTuba ready.
3428044	3428604	Hold on, hold on.
3429164	3430965	I need to get SadTuba ready for this.
3430985	3431365	Let me think.
3431405	3434047	I'm trying to guess how terrible it could be.
3437942	3439643	Uh, it's not Mark McGrath, is it?
3439923	3440663	No, it's not.
3441044	3442684	I think he does the lyrics show.
3442764	3443805	Yeah, but he's still terrible.
3443965	3444165	Okay.
3444545	3452728	No, hosting 1 vs. 100 on Game Show Network with a top prize of $50,000, down from a million, Carrie Ann Inaba.
3454349	3455109	Who the hell's that?
3455950	3457110	From Dancing with the Stars.
3457590	3457730	Oh.
3457930	3458150	Huh?
3458471	3459111	Yeah, exactly.
3462176	3463617	She's the girl on Dancing with the Stars.
3463637	3464077	I'm telling you.
3464157	3470400	Because you know it takes a real dancer to know how to... If you want to replace Bob Saget, you know who you need to pick.
3470640	3470840	What?
3470980	3471860	Tom Bergeron.
3472321	3472981	Tom Bergeron.
3473021	3473701	Yes, exactly.
3473721	3475702	Well, he's busy hosting Dancing with the Stars.
3475722	3477863	There's like the biggest show on TV now.
3478203	3481186	Oh, come on, it doesn't take that long to host Dancing with the Stars.
3481206	3485149	I mean, come on, he can fit it in his workday to go host that other show.
3485189	3489532	I mean, shit, that's like, you know, maybe four hours at the most.
3489793	3497239	It's crazy pants to me, though, that the 1 vs. 100 is, like, gone from Xbox Live so that they can do this cheap version on Game Show Network with Kariana Nava.
3497259	3497699	You know what I mean?
3497739	3498159	No disrespect.
3498540	3502063	I'm sure it'll be fine, and it's gonna be, you know, for an original game show, it'll be fine.
3502103	3502343	Did you...
3502603	3509966	No, this is totally random, but it makes no sense because I actually saw this on the soup, I think.
3511187	3514588	Punk'd is coming back, and they're having Justin Bieber hosting it.
3515028	3515989	What the hell is that?
3516149	3517590	No, that has to be a lie.
3517690	3518270	I don't believe that.
3518710	3521751	That has as much truth as the LAPD buying all the jetpacks.
3522092	3523652	That's how true that story is.
3524172	3524713	Come on.
3526854	3527434	No way.
3528513	3530796	Justin Bieber is too busy.
3531457	3535102	He's making 15-year-old girls' panties wet all across internationally.
3535843	3536824	That's his job.
3536964	3537946	He doesn't have time to do punk.
3538006	3543914	And seriously, they have a bunch of other cast members from that 70s show that aren't working right now that can easily host that.
3543954	3544515	Exactly.
3547725	3550228	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3565004	3569267	My Baby 3 on the Nintendo DS.
3569287	3579456	This was the game that actually had a lawsuit pending with it because Majesco and apparently some other company were fighting over the rights to My Baby.
3580897	3604021	they're fighting over my baby Borderlands give me the year edition coming out this week that's right Borderlands with all the extra download content all for 60 bucks that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 seriously if you don't own this game you need to buy it which I don't actually so this might be a good deal you need to buy it it's fucking amazing I'm gonna wait for the price drop the inevitable price drop that will happen on this game
3604761	3606682	I think the original game has already dropped in price.
3606862	3608863	No, but I can get the one with all the Uber content.
3609623	3611604	Isn't there like a zombie expansion or something?
3611624	3613125	Yeah, that was one of the first expansions.
3613505	3614305	I need that, don't I?
3614425	3615166	It's awesome.
3615366	3617347	It seriously is awesome.
3617627	3620528	Okay, and then the Invisimals coming out on the PSP this week.
3620848	3622590	That's right, it's the game with the camera.
3623270	3624691	Yay, camera.
3625372	3631877	I've only been waiting years for that stupid thing to come out on the PSP, and now you release it with a crappy-ass game.
3632678	3636761	By the way, iPet's coming out on the PSP in a couple weeks anyways.
3637802	3638603	Yay, terrible.
3639924	3643227	Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals on Nintendo DS.
3643727	3645389	Wow, Lufia's old school.
3645489	3648051	Isn't a Lufia what I use in the shower to wash my butt?
3648071	3648912	That's a Lufa.
3652388	3656836	Canada Hunt on the Wii it's where you hunt Canadians
3657546	3658126	Awesome.
3658826	3659166	Really?
3660007	3660747	No, it's not.
3660847	3661947	Oh, I was like, damn.
3662287	3665508	If by Canadians you mean native wildlife in Canada.
3666188	3667188	Like mooses and shit?
3667708	3667988	Yes.
3668169	3670189	Oh, boring.
3670349	3671689	Dragon's Lair Trilogy.
3671749	3674010	This is awesome because it doesn't have three dragons.
3674070	3675770	There was no third Dragon's Lair.
3675850	3677251	I bet one of them is Space Ace.
3677411	3678211	You are correct.
3678231	3679731	I'm like, wait a minute.
3679751	3681592	There was no Dragon's Lair 3.
3682292	3683792	It's sort of Dragon's Lair.
3683832	3685753	It's Dragon's Lair in space.
3686153	3686633	Oh, sorry.
3687593	3712589	Lucha Libre Heroes Del Ring that's coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week Dragon Age Origins the Ultimate Edition also another re-release with both Dragon Age Origins and the Awakenings expansion I think all the download content as well that's going to be coming out for $50 at least on PC I think it's $60 on PS3 and 360 um
3717162	3719123	Okay, that makes no sense at all.
3719364	3721505	Oh, I guess that was with the system.
3722206	3722766	Never mind.
3723507	3725688	For a second there, I thought they were selling invisibles by itself.
3725708	3727129	I'm like, what would you do with that?
3727169	3728110	You don't have the camera.
3729591	3733034	That's right, bringing the gaming news to you, we think, here at Orange Sands Radio.
3733413	3738436	No, they're actually selling the system because they think Invisimals is a system seller.
3739756	3741497	Oh, that's a brace yourself.
3741717	3742658	That's hilarious.
3743358	3749902	Sengoku Barsara Samurai Heroes, the game which was originally over here as... Oh, of course, now I can't remember.
3749982	3750602	Oh, Devil Kings.
3751183	3754264	That's on PlayStation 3 and on the Wii, of course, because it uses Waggle.
3754805	3756966	And now PS3 has Waggle, so that's also fun.
3759187	3760708	I Love Puppies on Nintendo DS.
3760768	3761008	Yes.
3762981	3764643	I'm not going to say really much more about that.
3765103	3769048	Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, the game of the year edition with all the download content in there.
3769188	3769769	Good God.
3769989	3771551	That's like the third one.
3771651	3773133	They're doing a lot of re-releases.
3773553	3775315	Ooh, is Just Dance 2 this week?
3775335	3776917	Just Dance 2 is this week.
3777057	3777397	Yes!
3778999	3780401	Reason to hook up my Wii.
3780661	3781362	I played it.
3781542	3782103	It was pretty fun.
3783146	3784986	And no, I don't know where the YouTube videos are.
3785167	3785627	Damn.
3786187	3787007	They're out there somewhere.
3790208	3793449	Before I die, I have to see Loki getting down to TikTok.
3793729	3795469	Oh no, it was worse than that.
3796089	3797370	We did It's Rainy Men.
3797850	3798570	Oh my god.
3800210	3801751	It's somewhere on YouTube, right?
3801871	3802231	Already?
3802451	3804171	I don't know if it is on YouTube.
3804551	3805992	Tiger Claw needs to find it.
3806352	3807872	Because he finds everything on the internet.
3808072	3809713	I can find it if it's actually out there.

3838434	3841760	I didn't realize Rock Band 3 was coming out this week.
3841820	3841980	What?
3842040	3842561	No, it's not.
3842802	3843162	Shut up.
3843302	3844004	Yeah, it's not.
3844104	3847129	But for some reason, the wireless keyboard's available this week.
3847590	3848030	Awesome!
3848070	3849693	I can pretend I'm playing Rock Band.
3850735	3851717	That's great.
3852598	3855880	Oh, and it would be great also, Solitaire Overload Plus.
3856160	3858181	These release dates coming to an end, that would be great too.
3858661	3859602	No, they're not.
3859642	3860182	God!
3860442	3867245	Hello Kitty DS Bundle, they're releasing Hello Kitty with a... Because clearly you've saved the AAA titles for last.
3867846	3870027	Brunswick Cosmic Bowling with a Bowling Ball.
3872203	3873264	That sounds dangerous.
3876325	3879727	They just did that to make it lulzy to fit that on the shelves at GameStop.
3879807	3881849	Now, this is GameStop's website.
3881869	3883089	I'm reading off of it right here.
3883389	3885331	The Wii inflatable racing cart.
3885371	3885851	That's right.
3885931	3889013	The one that you can play Mario Kart in is coming to stores this week.
3889873	3890674	That is exciting.
3890694	3891114	Wait, wait, wait.
3891334	3893195	There's an actual inflatable cart?
3893215	3896237	Inflatable cart that you can sit in.
3896257	3900000	You stick the steering wheel in there and you... I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
3900160	3901981	Jamie, I want to buy this and bring it over.
3902261	3902581	Okay.
3903182	3905803	You can spend your money on it and you can drive over here.
3905823	3906384	How much is it?
3906684	3907845	How much is the inflatable cart?
3907905	3909165	It's 40 bucks.
3910166	3911087	That's quite a bit of money.
3911147	3911487	I don't know.
3912453	3920876	I was actually going to say, because I don't think it made our show roll, but they actually have, there was another peripheral that's coming out that's also inflatable.
3921336	3924797	It is an inflatable raft to play with Connect Adventures.
3924877	3925938	Yeah, it was on our Twitter.
3926238	3926798	That's right.
3927238	3927638	Whatever.
3927778	3928238	And we got it.
3928519	3928739	Yeah.
3928939	3930639	It's an inflatable raft.
3930859	3932140	It's just an inflatable raft.
3932160	3932860	That's all it is.
3932980	3933380	Good times.
3933540	3940843	Because, you know, people can't pretend they have the actual inflatable raft for the truly immersive experience, apparently.
3945205	3946566	Okay, this is a pretty big one this week.
3946967	3951030	Kirby's Epic Yarn is coming out on the Wii, and that'll be a week from today.
3951350	3953451	And that is it.
3956434	3956714	All right.
3957553	3958793	Let's go to Japanese release dates.
3958813	3959974	I'll try to make this quick and painless.
3961214	3964775	In Japan, on the Xbox 360, Medal of Honor gets its release this week.
3964935	3967115	NBA 2K11, also coming out in Japan this week.
3967655	3971636	SBKX Superbike World Championship comes out as well.
3971996	3976918	And some new Xbox 360 wireless headsets and network adapters come out in some different colors.
3976938	3980218	I don't know if that's because of the soon-to-come upgrades with the voice chat.
3980298	3980598	I don't know.
3980919	3982099	But those are coming out anyhow.
3983439	3992162	Moving on over to the PlayStation 3 Medal of Honor NBA 2K11 and World Soccer Winning 11 2011 all come out this week.
3992702	3993742	So look forward to that.
3994022	3996563	World Soccer Winning 11 is a few days behind the others.
3996603	3997743	I think it's on a special day.
3997843	3999424	So just a heads up on that.
3999484	4000704	It's not on the usual release day.
4001785	4005307	Going over to the Nintendo Wii, and the game's coming out there.
4005987	4012011	Kaito no Kirby comes out on the Nintendo Wii, which is just the same Kirby game that Loki was earlier talking about.
4012111	4013512	It's just the Japanese version.
4014873	4017855	Nothing on the PlayStation 2, because obviously things are drying up over there.
4018515	4023679	But looking at the handhelds real quick, on the Sony PSP, DJ Max Portable 3 comes out.
4023699	4028982	And I know we have some folks that are really into the music games that are really looking forward to this, probably already have their pre-orders ready.
4029202	4029803	Set to go.
4029883	4032466	That is coming out in Korea this week.
4032506	4033988	The first print and the limited edition.
4034028	4036571	I'm sure there's folks already having their imports on the way.
4037673	4041357	Otherwise, as far as Japanese releases go, Lord of Arcana comes out this week.
4041658	4044361	That is a Squeenix game that is coming out in Japan.
4044801	4047525	So take a look at that if you're into the Squeenix games.
4048105	4077531	otherwise NBA 2K11 also coming out on the PSP and Memories Off 6 Next Relation is coming out as well I have no idea what that is but it's called Memories Off 6 Next Relation it just shows kind of a chick dancing on the cover so I'm just more relations I'm assuming it's just yet another little dating game because but there's a part where she's singing karaoke and there's another part look at this this girl here she's kind of a whore like she's lying on the bed and her blouse is like half open look at that I can see her boobies you don't see nipple but you definitely see her boobies
4079090	4079870	She's just tired.
4080951	4081571	And it must be hard.
4081591	4082651	Tired of wearing clothes.
4082691	4085972	That's what she's tired of.
4086032	4086912	Quickly on the DS.
4087212	4088453	I skipped over the DS completely.
4088473	4090973	Let me see if I can look up DS releases real quick here.
4092834	4094934	Don't think there's a whole lot coming out this week, actually.
4096955	4101776	Gingotetsu Duo 999 DS.
4102016	4103517	It's in a huge box.
4103797	4106818	It's an exotic sci-fi game.
4108138	4108678	Coming out.
4109078	4111820	Oh, because it's in limited and premium box edition.
4112860	4115101	Let's see if there's screenshots here on the regular version.
4115121	4118462	Isn't that Galaxy Express or something?
4118602	4120883	It could be because I noticed it has the Chi-Chi train in it.
4121283	4122364	Oh, okay, so it's Galaxy Express.
4123124	4123524	Oh, there it is.
4124525	4125685	Look at that, you anime nerds.
4126366	4126626	Love it.
4126766	4128987	Did you see what they're doing live action?
4129007	4131128	Oh, what the fuck was it?
4131248	4133288	It's Spaceship Yamamoto.
4134229	4134689	Yamato.
4134869	4135529	Yamato, yeah.
4135549	4136750	They're doing a live action one of that.
4136770	4137090	Looks awesome.
4137475	4138836	It was Starblazers in the US.
4138936	4141358	Yeah, wake me when they have a panty and stocking game, okay?
4141398	4142119	That's all I'm saying.
4144120	4145762	That's something Alan turned me on to this week.
4145802	4146662	Panty and stocking.
4146682	4147423	Look it up on YouTube.
4147463	4147663	It's epic.
4147683	4148504	We need the music, Rob.
4149084	4150025	Need more cosplay.
4150834	4151474	Do we need the music?
4151494	4152235	We need the music.
4152395	4153176	Hold on, I'll get the music.
4153576	4155957	Can you explain what panty and stocking is real quick while I get the music?
4156158	4165924	It's an anime by Gainax and the same guys that did Powerpuff Girls Z, which was the sort of more teenage version of Powerpuff Girls they did in Japan.
4166044	4167345	Okay, she needs to get to the good stuff.
4167625	4167865	Okay.
4167885	4169786	The chick kicks off her panties and turns them into a gun.
4170007	4170287	Okay.
4171027	4174650	It's about two angels kicked out of heaven, one for having too much sex and the other for eating too much sex.
4179494	4180896	This is from their transformation.
4180916	4187963	This sounds very luminous.
4189405	4192488	This could totally be inluminous.
4192508	4194350	The whole series isn't animated like this though.
4196297	4197178	That's the regular style.
4228200	4229321	was there anything else to say about this?
4230601	4232142	she shoots the shit monster in the face
4247391	4251893	I dug the kind of the swing music for Space Channel 5.
4252253	4258496	I dig it too, but like, you know, I want something a little cross between like Rez, Children of Eden with, you know, like Space Channel 5.
4258536	4264099	Less of the psychedelic stuff, but, you know, still that kind of high energy type of game.
4264139	4269722	Because I don't know if a lot of people get into the swing stuff, although I totally dig the old soundtrack, but...
4270902	4271743	I could see something like that.
4272223	4273664	Just really off the wall.
4274705	4276567	Sadly, I don't think it will have that same theme.
4276987	4278889	Just so you know.
4278929	4287055	It's a little inappropriate for us rude Americans that don't understand the finer things in life.
4287095	4289077	It really isn't that far away from Bayonetta.
4289257	4290498	I'm just saying.
4292099	4293701	That's a game I need to go back and finish.
4293781	4297023	Honestly, when Alan first explained that to me, I was like, is this a sequel to Bayonetta?
4297064	4297584	What is this?
4299125	4300307	Banna is so awesome.
4300967	4302909	Alright, DarkSakura, UK releases.
4303070	4305052	Sorry.
4305192	4307975	UK releases take us like an hour on this show.
4309377	4310438	Can I speak now, please?
4310458	4311139	Yes, you can.
4312453	4318778	For the UK, on the 12th, we have Arcania, Gothic 4, and EverQuest, House of Thul.
4319678	4320179	Thul.
4320799	4321540	Thul!
4321560	4323101	Okay.
4323161	4325402	Also, LEGO Universe, Pinball FX 2.
4326243	4328425	On the 13th is Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Episode 1.
4329385	4333108	And the 15th is Alan Wake, The Rider, and Medal of Honor.
4333928	4337551	Also, Naruto, Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2.
4337591	4337771	Okay.
4340453	4340853	That's it.
4341734	4343535	And that's what I have to say about Naruto games.
4344856	4346277	Of which there are always plenty.
4347358	4347698	Alright.
4348619	4349360	It wins a poopy.
4350100	4350461	Alright.
4351081	4352182	Loki, what do you got for us in gaming news?
4352202	4354323	Ultimate Ninja 2 is actually really awesome.
4355304	4356245	I don't know if you've seen it.
4356285	4358707	It looks like an interactive anime.
4360095	4360696	Thanks for watching!
4384218	4387039	Okay, so other stuff that's not Naruto related, of course.
4388500	4394982	This is kind of odd to be hearing a first-party company say, but apparently Nintendo is saying, hey, you know what?
4395323	4398144	You can't blame piracy for poor game sales.
4398564	4402705	Or at least they're saying you can't blame piracy completely for poor game sales.
4404626	4409208	I don't think we should attribute bad software sales solely to piracy.
4411109	4418872	They're talking a little bit about, this was I guess during a Q&A session I guess last week when they were talking about the 3DS pricing and stuff like that.
4419372	4428755	It's true there's always an influence of piracy, but it's important for us to increase the number of our consumers who are willing to shell out their money to purchase our products.
4429236	4432957	So we do not intend to think that slower sales are solely due to piracy.
4433177	4442119	And I kind of agree with them because a lot of people out there, you know, people that pirate games aren't necessarily people that buy games.
4443059	4454622	So if you lose a sale to someone pirating a game doesn't mean you're actually going to lose a sale, you know, a physical copy sale because they were never going to purchase a copy of the game in the first place.
4455382	4457783	DarkToagak in our chat room is saying, Nintendo's saying that?
4457843	4458343	Bullshit.
4458443	4459883	Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
4462023	4464444	Um, but it was Iwata that said that, so.
4465144	4466824	What, and it was a magazine interview?
4466844	4467564	I'm sorry, I missed the source.
4467584	4468824	No, this was, it wasn't a magazine interview.
4468864	4472565	It was during, I guess a live interview during their Nintendo conference thing.
4472685	4472785	Wow.
4472805	4475226	When they were talking about like the 3DS pricing and stuff like that.
4475386	4476026	Oh, right, okay.
4477666	4478266	So, um.
4480107	4486248	Well, I mean, you're kind of right in that regard that I think the people who pirate games aren't usually the ones who are going to run to the store and buy them anyway.
4486496	4490557	The thing I do kind of see as a problem... Not that it excuses it.
4490637	4491557	No, it doesn't excuse it.
4491937	4504720	But I think, for example, like on the Wii and stuff, a lot of the games that are more niche or adult and stuff don't seem to do as well as, say, some of the games that most people would be like, why is that selling so much?
4504801	4506421	It's just a shitty-ass party game.
4506961	4508721	But people buy that stuff.
4509022	4514743	Just like Just Dance, a game that when it first came out, I'm like, this is stupid.
4515103	4526147	and then it's just at the top of the charts and then you play it and you're like wow this is actually kind of fun I had people come up to me at work who knew I had a video game addiction and asked me if I've ever played it because they had and they had so much fun with it and I'm thinking like really?
4526587	4541952	It's weird the thing about Just Dance though and it's kind of funny is you know that Michael Jackson experience it's pretty much the same game but that has also karaoke in there as well if you want to otherwise it's Just Dance, Michael Jackson that's basically what that is
4542492	4559380	but it's probably part of the agreement with the Michael Jackson camp or whatever you call it that they can't put Michael Jackson's name below the title of the game like like probably like when Beatles rock band came out there's no way they were gonna call that game rock band Beatles it was always the Beatles rock band yeah you know I mean
4560928	4561928	I'm the same thing with Michael Jackson
4579913	4603246	except Dance Central and what I like about Dance Central a little bit more than say Just Dance is Dance Central first off can read your whole body it's not just reading the sensor so for example if you want to play Just Dance and kind of cheat at it you just do what they're doing with your one hand holding your remote your right hand you just do what they're doing on the screen you don't have to really do the rest of it
4603746	4604126	DarkSakura.com
4626118	4652066	so I think that's kind of neat there but yeah it's games like that that kind of appeal to the mass audience that seem to do well and then on the Wii or on the DS poor sales I mean a lot of that can be attributed to the games themselves because there's a lot of junk on the DS a lot of junk and unfortunately a lot of good games out there just kind of get ignored because of all the junk that's out there
4652906	4655788	Hey man, don't you want to pre-order your copy?
4676261	4677721	Hey, you look like a man on the mission.
4677741	4679682	Is there anything I can help you find?
4680342	4681962	No, I'm just looking around, killing time for my pizza.
4682162	4682982	Oh, that's a good idea.
4684862	4685643	Yeah, I thought so too.
4685943	4687063	Yeah, that's why I'm here.
4687083	4689803	Because I thought sitting around at a pizza place sucks.
4690283	4694984	No, but there was a kid walking around and he's like, is Far Cry Predator a good game?
4696484	4699485	And it's just like, well, that came out a while ago.
4699505	4701305	And besides, you're like 10.
4702005	4703526	You shouldn't be playing a mature rated game.
4703546	4705346	Because your parents don't care.
4705799	4707621	You know, but when we were young... Oh, God.
4708102	4708542	Here we go.
4708602	4716291	When we were young and playing those 8-bit Nintendo games, there was a lot of crap that we liked that I bet a lot of people kind of looked at and went, boy, this is not a good game.
4716492	4720056	But see, a lot of the focus, though, was about games being fun.
4720116	4725923	See, now... And now, I get it that there's a lot of that stuff out there now that...
4728243	4731828	I mean, back in our day, there was also educational games and stuff like that, too.
4731948	4734612	But we were smart enough to know, okay, that's an educational game.
4734853	4736395	I'm not touching that shit.
4736515	4739720	Unless it was Oregon Trail or Number Munchers.
4740256	4743399	Hey, well that stuff was force-fed onto us, you know, at an early age.
4744159	4746461	And, you know, we just adapted to it.
4746922	4751766	But I'm saying, like, you know, with... There's a lot of educational product out there on the DS.
4751786	4753527	There's a lot of crappy licensed games.
4753687	4756170	Well, there's a lot of crappy licensed games even on the NES.
4756690	4757771	Although Cool Spot was awesome.
4758512	4759753	And Yonoid wasn't that bad.
4760253	4761954	So they could pull it off back then.
4761974	4765998	It's just now, unfortunately, it's all about the license and not about the gameplay.
4768141	4776882	as you know they have the Jelly Belly puzzle game and the still waiting for my Kill Bill video game that's all I'm saying never gonna happen
4777208	4777928	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4806642	4807543	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4828712	4841396	If you get three versions, you'll get a special call-out on the Sega blogs and the Sonic 4 website's news feed and special placement in one very cool spot to be revealed.
4843337	4843657	Ooh.
4844517	4847598	And if you get all four versions, so meaning what?
4847618	4849499	$15 on the PS3, $15 on the 360, $15 on the Wii, and what?
4849559	4850679	Another $10 on the iPhone, right?
4853160	4865290	So if you buy all four versions, you will be featured in a special video shout-out from Aaron Weber, who's the Sega Community Manager and the Brand Manager for Sonic 4, Ken Balo.
4865970	4871795	That video will be posted on Sega's YouTube page and all across Sega realms here on the internets.
4872536	4874497	And that's the exact quote, here on the internets.
4875898	4876419	There you go.
4876499	4880302	You could be internet famous if you drop $55 on Sonic 4.
4880702	4881823	What do you say, DarkSakura?
4882163	4882844	Let's buy them all.
4883655	4883935	Okay.
4883955	4888156	I love the enthusiasm.
4890177	4891317	Loki, what do you think?
4891337	4892637	You gonna buy them all to get mentioned?
4892657	4893777	I'm buying none of them.
4895458	4896058	Screw you, Sega.
4896138	4902619	I don't need you to say my name, you know, in order to feel special.
4902699	4904360	Frisbee in our chat says, the call out?
4904420	4905500	Thanks for nothing, fool.
4906260	4908101	Salacious Pop says, wow, no one cur.
4911360	4913922	and Actdeft says, my name featured on a sticky thread.
4914042	4914742	Seriously.
4917283	4917924	See, that's the thing.
4918644	4921966	It's in a sticky thread, but who the fuck's going to read the sticky thread?
4922546	4924427	Oh, hey, look, Bob's name's on there.
4924668	4927629	Way to go, Bob, purchasing two copies of the game.
4927949	4928750	You're an idiot.
4930090	4935933	I wonder though if they say the special placement in one very cool spot for buying three versions.
4936273	4940315	I wonder if that's in the credits of Sonic 4 Part 2.
4940395	4941316	That's probably what it is.
4941536	4942416	That's still dumb.
4943537	4945938	Don't you want your name in a video game?
4948179	4953801	It should reward you with Episode 2 instead of just... Oh, so like incentives.
4953961	4957383	They've already spoiled who the main character of Episode 2 is going to be.
4957885	4960126	Oh, are you going to spoil it for all our listeners?
4961227	4964909	I don't even know what the character's name is because once again, I don't follow Sonic.
4965310	4967231	It's a stupid Sonic robot thing.
4967691	4971273	Not Metal Sonic, but it's the one with, he has a spiky nose.
4972874	4975376	That's my wonderful description of the Sonic character.
4975676	4980859	Frisbee in our chatroom says, if you want your name in a thread, just post in that thread.
4982460	4983201	That's a good idea.
4984181	4987263	I'm going to start, no, I'm not going to do that because that would require effort.
4987283	4994489	I was going to say, someone should start a thread on that same forum of people who put their names in who haven't bought any copies of it.
4995290	5001435	Defective Candy in our chatroom says, maybe you guys could say, hey, give me five bucks and we'll stick your name to the top of the OLR forums.
5002836	5004517	I'd love to, but I don't know.
5004557	5006338	That just seems really wrong to me.
5006398	5007419	It's just really wrong.
5008160	5013204	Actdeft in our chat says, Loki, Sky, and Jamie need to buy one each and get OLR mentioned, though.
5013664	5016145	No, I'm not buying a copy of that.
5016185	5018045	You can buy three and get OLR mentioned.
5018825	5019505	Exactly.
5020585	5022646	I would like to submit a fake name.
5023346	5025827	Like, you know, Bonnie Von Fluffles or something like that.
5025887	5027607	You know, like, submit fake names.
5027627	5030087	That would be funny to get this community manager to say.
5030627	5031788	Sassy Pants Fuzzy Bottom?
5031988	5032648	Exactly.
5033208	5034008	I love that idea.
5035168	5037609	And big shout out to Sassy Pants Fuzzy Bottom.
5040390	5040930	Good times.
5042491	5047795	Let's take a look in gaming's history and the way things used to be in a better time.
5048495	5049916	It's the classic game of the week.
5049996	5058582	It's the part of our show where DarkSakura goes into the vault and says, Hey, I'm going to find a game that these kids should be playing.
5059242	5063024	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week for these little brats who don't know better?
5063525	5065406	The classic game is Final Fantasy V. Yay.
5066567	5067407	Yay.
5070907	5074890	I picked boss music because I couldn't find anything else.
5075150	5076150	Yeah, it's a game by Square.
5076571	5076851	Came out in 1992.
5076911	5081494	It was only out in Japan for the longest time on the Super Famicom.
5082535	5084457	And it's super fun.
5085477	5092703	It stars a guy named Bartz, who actually, for the longest time, it was Buttz.
5094443	5097824	Which I used to laugh, but anyway.
5098704	5104206	A meteor falls and he goes to check it out and then, oh noes, we need the crystals.
5104286	5110968	We have to seal Exdeath, which is the coolest name for a bad guy in a series ever.
5111608	5112088	Exdeath.
5112888	5113808	Wouldn't you be afraid, Rob?
5115069	5116649	I might be afraid of Exdeath.
5117717	5119719	Anyway, the cool thing about this game is the job system.
5121820	5128206	You get your experience point and you battle monsters and stuff like any Final Fantasy game.
5128246	5134611	You can get a chocobo and you get a ship and an airship and you do different stuff.
5135311	5149154	This is the second one that uses the active time battle, where time will flow continuously for both players and enemies, which was first in Final Fantasy IV, which was 2 when it came out over here.
5149294	5157676	The job system, though, is a really cool thing, because you can gain different special abilities and sort of mix up your jobs.
5158756	5162597	You get ability points, so you increase the job levels for different characters.
5163717	5174307	And you can also say, say you have a knight who also has white magic levels, well then you become a paladin, for an example.
5176028	5179792	This is also the game that introduced the blue mage, the time mage, and the mime.
5181333	5183335	So that's why we have them in other Final Fantasy games.
5185653	5186474	This is a really cool game.
5186514	5187795	It had lots of cool characters.
5187895	5192680	You have Lena, Bartz, Forrest, Kreel.
5192900	5193921	They're really cool.
5195082	5198786	Also, a reoccurring boss, which is what this music is, is Gilgamesh.
5200067	5200948	Always Gilgamesh.
5201028	5202029	Lots of Gilgamesh battles.
5203310	5204611	So yeah, it's a pretty cool game.
5205032	5212478	If you haven't played it yet, for the longest time you can only play it if you either had the cartridge or had a really good emulator.
5213238	5214800	Read Japanese or it was translated.
5216241	5216961	So it's really cool.
5218062	5223887	It was also one of... And your microphone failed at this game.
5223907	5224567	What?
5225328	5225848	You can hear me.
5226669	5227149	Now I can.
5227170	5227390	Okay.
5227410	5227550	Okay.
5228570	5234155	Well, as I was saying, it's one of the ones that was directed by Sakaguchi, sorry.
5234936	5237058	And this is his favorite Final Fantasy game.
5238259	5242584	All of the character designs, logo, everything was done by Amano.
5243244	5244886	Yoshitaka Amano, who is my hero.
5246347	5249290	And the battle graphics were done by Nomura.
5249731	5250451	So that's pretty cool.
5252533	5252653	And...
5254895	5255956	MAMBO DE CHOCOPO
5277694	5279595	We have since seen it elsewhere.
5280235	5285056	It's come out on the PlayStation in Japan.
5285836	5290018	There was a Final Fantasy collection that came out over here that had Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 6 on it.
5290738	5292418	It had a full motion video opening.
5293259	5293739	Very cool.
5294859	5303721	And then we had the Final Fantasy Anthology also on the PlayStation.
5304842	5305042	And...
5307669	5313613	They, uh, that's why they, uh, where they changed the name to, uh, Bart.
5316876	5318317	And Gil instead of Guido.
5320238	5322440	Um, there was PlayStation 2 release.
5323821	5324622	There was...
5328401	5329602	Game Boy Advance release.
5330403	5334025	They had an extra level and a new boss.
5335346	5337988	And they were designed by Amano.
5339028	5340789	And then there was Final Fantasy V Advance.
5342090	5344732	And it was really cool.
5345032	5348414	There was, however, an anime that was called Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystals.
5349355	5350296	It was an OAV.
5351216	5352417	It was done by Studio Madhouse.
5353418	5356580	And it was the sequel to Final Fantasy V.
5360117	5373119	there you go alright your classic game of the week boys and girls Final Fantasy 5 the one that was just too cool for America for so many years but finally Square came to their damn senses so there it is
5373667	5383271	we're tired of you people just downloading ROMs here, shoot Salacious Pop in our chatroom says can I ask why we haven't heard of Final Fantasy 5 or 6 for DS yet?
5383691	5401939	3 and 4 remakes were white glove and awesome I would like to see a 5 remake on the DS they were working on one there's a talk of it but not just at last interview maybe they will be on the 3 DS maybe that's why it's been held up a little while that's right, very special
5402734	5413639	Alright, we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but never fear, we'll be back in just a little bit with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio or Rapid Fire News Twitter topics, so make sure you get those in at twitter.com slash OLR if you have something you want us to talk about.
5414019	5420883	We'll talk a little bit about a classic arcade game that has me very happy coming back to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, and I'm sure all of you will too.
5421443	5422984	Mega Man Legends 3 news.
5423604	5424985	The audience is in control.
5425365	5426685	Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
5426705	5429907	We'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5436189	5438851	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5438991	5443033	We are taping live on this Sunday evening, October the 10th of 2010.
5443554	5446375	Happy 10-10-10 to all of you folks out there listening.
5447296	5451859	We are taping the 385th episode of our show, believe it or not.
5452319	5452900	Let it loose, baby
5484295	5486541	So you can just hear the epic epicness in it.
5486602	5488286	It's like the music on the title screen, which is...
5493289	5494970	So yeah, I love the Civilization series.
5494990	5495411	What can I say?
5495531	5496972	I have yet to check out 5, though.
5497012	5504796	It's all part of that whole, like, I spent all my money on Disneyland this month, so I haven't purchased a lot of games, but that's one of the ones I've got to look into getting, for sure.
5505116	5506257	So, we'll see.
5507518	5509739	By the way, things going on this week.
5509879	5513001	Guess what is happening this Wednesday?
5513281	5514482	Do you know what this Wednesday is?
5514542	5516143	Wednesday is a very important day for me.
5516803	5517924	It is October 13th.
5518184	5518484	Anyone?
5518824	5519104	Anyone?
5519985	5521826	It is my... You all right?
5522887	5523587	I was going to answer.
5523748	5525249	Yeah, because you know I told you before the show.
5525269	5525449	All right.
5525709	5527850	It's my 10-year anniversary of playing DDR.
5527950	5528330	That's right.
5528811	5536976	10 years ago on October the 13th was the first day I ever played DDR, which might not seem like a big deal to all of you because like, oh, hey, dancing, arrow stomping game, ha-ha, funny.
5537336	5540138	But if it weren't for DDR, this show wouldn't exist.
5540198	5542680	I probably would not know Jamie or Matt if it weren't for DDR.
5542980	5547122	We probably would have ran into each other in some nerd circle one way or another, but it just would not have happened the same way.
5547643	5547783	So...
5548623	5561506	Next week on the program, to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of me playing DDR, we've actually invited a guest who was there that night because it was her first time ever playing DDR.
5561886	5563626	She's going to be here next week on the show.
5564046	5567067	Jessica Harper from Understation Live is going to be here in the house.
5567407	5572568	Some of you guys know her as Iguana Girl, one of the admins of DDR Freak for, I believe, a couple years.
5572968	5574888	So she has a lot of Ditter history.
5574948	5575749	So it'll be good times.
5575829	5577129	We're going to have her on the show.
5578009	5584311	and kind of look back on DDR and video games at large because I know she plays some other video games too so we're going to have a good time next week.
5584931	5589593	See, Travis says I don't love Under Station Live enough sometimes but you know what?
5589613	5592134	We're going to have one of the hosts right here on the show so it'll be a good time.
5592754	5594135	This is heart, heart, heart, heart, love.
5594155	5594735	Exactly.
5594995	5595915	Heart, heart, heart, love.
5596516	5596976	Good times.
5597556	5599217	And he's welcome to come out here anytime he wants.
5599237	5599717	That's right.
5599757	5604018	If Travis wants to fly his ass out to Sacramento, he's welcome to come on the show anytime.
5604819	5605119	All right.
5605679	5610421	Loomy's in our chatroom says, did you lose a lot of weight during those 10 years playing DDR?
5612062	5612402	No.
5614022	5614643	Not now.
5614783	5617904	I wish I was playing as much DDR as I was back then because that would help.
5617924	5618324	Absolutely.
5618524	5619285	DarkSakura.com
5639443	5640104	That is terrible.
5640324	5646750	It's not going to be like, surprise, cow brains, or surprise, it's the uterus of a duck, you know, or something like that.
5646770	5647311	You know what I mean?
5647331	5648872	Hey, Dan's had a cow brain dinner.
5648892	5653156	I never heard you complaining when I stuffed cow brains in the uterus of a duck and fried it, okay?
5656147	5659689	And now I eat double bacon pizzas Which is funny because now I'm mostly vegetarian
5677293	5680315	I know you're the one that's actually lost the weight since those days.
5680335	5684739	I know you guys need to stop being vegetarian because I have to eat more meat to compensate.
5685499	5686600	I'm not vegetarian.
5686680	5688101	I'm whatever.
5688301	5690303	I eat meat like once a month.
5691104	5692324	Alright.
5692344	5694166	I mean, you know, like cow flesh.
5694758	5700502	Alright, we'll talk more about all that and that stuff in a future episode next week.
5700522	5702083	We have skinny raw pictures up there, I guess.
5702363	5708488	Oh, yeah, Jessica dug up like hecka old pictures on Facebook and found, I gotta see which one she put up there.
5709428	5709989	Oh, God.
5713751	5714772	Next week's going to be a fun show.
5715232	5718454	It's one of me playing Magenta at the Rocky Horror Picture Show, yes.
5718895	5719655	Thanks, Jessica.
5719815	5720576	Thanks so much for that.
5720596	5721396	All right.
5722197	5723217	You were so gorgeous.
5724318	5725039	Let's move on.
5725099	5728941	Let's go back to gaming news and all that fun stuff here.
5729201	5730943	No, I want to talk more about Robin Address.
5731023	5731823	No, let's not.
5732864	5734245	I don't want to give people the wrong impression.
5734285	5734905	It's Rocky Horror.
5734925	5735346	It's different.
5735806	5736847	All right.
5737027	5740529	Loki, start us off with some rapid-fire news, please.
5741009	5751096	Well, during releases this week, I mentioned that the Gears of War, that'd be funny, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition is going to be coming out.
5752477	5767528	And, well, what's kind of neat about it is they just announced that the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands, and this pisses me off because I bought most of the download content on its own, will be coming with not only all the download content for Borderlands, but early access to Duke Nukem Forever.
5769352	5770073	In other words, the demo.
5771154	5774178	So even more incentive to spend $60 on a game most of you already have.
5775119	5775680	Exactly.
5776802	5777603	God, I want that demo.
5777823	5778584	But you know what though?
5779685	5785232	Me being me, that demo will leak out and I'll build a download, so I don't care.
5786193	5786934	Aren't you special?
5787651	5815386	I am faithful I'm thinking about, I don't know how much I'd like Borderlands But I hear it's like a first person World of Warcraft with guns Borderlands is fun It's like, yeah, it's a first person shooter But it's kind of a little bit of an RPG And there's a lot of, like, you know Looting, I guess So if you like loot It's a little bit like Diablo, I guess I like the phase walker girl She's pretty cool Yes, she is pretty awesome
5817597	5818939	Hunter, Mordecai, Raven of Death
5829548	5833509	Actdeft in our chatroom says, damn it, I got Borderlands on Steam for $10 US.
5835190	5838511	That's why they put it on sale right before all these announcements.
5839191	5841292	And Jessica's linking more old pictures of me.
5841372	5847333	She linked this one of me dressed up as Brad for the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Izam in our chatroom.
5847414	5848094	I hope I said that right.
5848174	5848474	Izam?
5848634	5848954	Izam?
5849034	5849294	Izam?
5849614	5851835	In our chatroom says, for a second I thought it was What the Buck.
5852575	5855296	DJ Hero 2 is coming out soon in a couple weeks
5879065	5879486	DJ Hero 2 Bundles
5896963	5906645	which, by the way, they are selling the original game by itself in case you want to build your own bundle over here in the U.S.
5907785	5911186	for another $50, which is kind of a ripoff if you ask me.
5911806	5918988	I believe, though, if you preorder through Toys R Us, which no one's really doing that anymore because Toys R Us is almost out of business.
5920388	5920668	That's my
5920708	5922389	I thought it was supposed to be a cheap place to get diapers.
5922429	5923690	There is no cheap place to get diapers.
5923710	5925751	But I think if you pre-order there, you also get a free copy of the game.
5925771	5926692	So it might be something to keep in mind.
5944838	5956689	And then last but not least, with the release of the new Mario Anniversary Edition, which, by the way, is just Mario All-Stars, but on the Wii now.
5958691	5960733	Not with extra Mario games or anything, right?
5960753	5961414	No, not with anything.
5961434	5963055	A port of the Super Nintendo.
5963075	5964657	A straight-ass port of the Nintendo game.
5964677	5966418	And it's not even the one that comes with Mario World, is it?
5966438	5969261	You know, something that they could have, I don't know, put on Virtual Console...
5970302	5970702	for like $10.
5971283	5973285	Well, maybe that's what they'll do here in the U.S.
5973345	5975166	because we haven't heard anything about this coming to the U.S., right?
5975186	5976067	Oh, it'll come to the U.S.
5976788	5977528	I guarantee it.
5977829	5983213	If they can charge $50 for something that's really worth $10, yeah, they'll bring it out over here.
5984234	5994043	But seriously, Nintendo, we've gotten into this conversation about how Nintendo doesn't really... They do make new stuff now, but a lot of the stuff that they put out, like, hey, look, new Mario game.
5994844	5995784	It's not really new.
5995865	5996265	It's just...
5997606	5998126	and many more.
6021539	6025780	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, great, now you're making me feel awful because I want this so bad.
6026320	6028241	You are an awful person if you want this so bad.
6028261	6028521	Stop it.
6028701	6029241	Stop it.
6029321	6031382	They didn't even change the color of the light in the front.
6031402	6033822	I mean, you can change that to like red or something, you know?
6033882	6035283	It's a collector's thing.
6035303	6035583	I don't know.
6035823	6036683	It's stupid.
6036703	6037323	What if he doesn't have a Wii?
6037363	6039084	I think it should have a Mario graphic on it.
6039944	6040724	Yeah, it should have at least a Mario.
6040744	6043965	They should put something, silkscreen some fucking shit on there.
6045826	6046686	We want stickers.
6046726	6047446	Pimp my Wii.
6047986	6048567	Pimp my Wii.
6048827	6049327	Ew.
6049447	6049507	Ew.
6051710	6053871	Alright, so Loki will not be pre-ordering one of these.
6053931	6066478	No, why would I want... Yeah, let me import a console from Japan, even though I have a Wii already that I don't play anything on, and then, you know, ooh, it's in a wonderful red color that I really don't like.
6066578	6067258	That's awesome.
6067418	6068739	Totally gonna put down four.
6070222	6071003	Thanks for watching!
6089236	6104718	Gears of War 3 is going to be coming out in the fall of 2011 so the beta will be out sometime in the spring maybe they haven't said exactly when next year they've just said next year there will be a beta so you guys can completely base your judgments of the game off a beta because it's what a lot of people do
6105719	6109560	LittleBigPlanet 2 also delayed until next year.
6109980	6111521	Maybe not as late next year.
6111581	6114602	I think I'm hearing it's just going to be January.
6114682	6118923	They are not going to actually release it this year in time for the holidays.
6119303	6122264	And the reason why, they don't want launch day passes.
6123274	6123634	Patches?
6123694	6124075	Patches.
6124095	6124695	Did I say patches?
6124915	6125335	Patches.
6125876	6127977	Quote, we could have shipped it and it would have been fine.
6128057	6131259	And this is a quote from the head of Media Molecule, Alex Evans.
6131779	6139644	However, we realized that with just a couple extra weeks we could make the game super amazing, adding the super onto the already amazing which exists today.
6139964	6143326	This is something that will live forever and the delay people will forget about.
6143687	6147649	I kind of like that he says that because that's a point we've brought up on the show before.
6147949	6148910	People don't forget.
6149230	6178676	oftentimes that these games were delayed if they were that good like for example Mario Brothers Melee Super Smash Brothers Melee or whatever the one on the Wii I was delayed like five times and people kind of just forgot by the time the game actually came out you know what though I'm saying this is a good thing this is a good deal if it keeps the game in good quality just like some of these other delays we've been hearing about it's very interesting though that always at the end of the year delay delay delay
6179076	6191206	It's great that they're putting it out so that we don't have any day one patches because those people that don't have their PlayStations connected to the PlayStation Network anymore because of USB devices that they're using with their PlayStation 3.
6192367	6193528	And one more for me.
6194509	6197011	This is about a new Shenmue game.
6197511	6199053	That's right.
6199093	6201314	There is a new Shenmue game coming out.
6201715	6204077	It's coming out in Japan this year.
6205703	6209148	Shenmue Town is coming out on Yahoo Japan.
6210410	6211690	DarkSakura, no frumping over there.
6211710	6215332	But sorry, it's not the game you were hoping I was going to mention here on the show.
6238864	6241514	SadTuba Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
6242492	6243733	Stuff and things.
6244213	6246735	How about Mega Man stuff?
6247455	6249137	There's going to be a comic out.
6249797	6251638	It's being put out by Archie Comics.
6252659	6257862	And they are saying it's going to be faithful to continuity, so hopefully.
6258463	6265007	Then again, they also did that Sonic the Hedgehog one that I didn't think was very good, nor the Knights one wasn't good at all.
6266368	6271491	But it is written by Ian Flynn, who's currently writing Sonic the Hedgehog.
6273433	6275274	Yeah, I don't really have high hopes for it.
6275794	6277234	The art looks interesting.
6278555	6281136	I mean, Proto Man looks really freaking cool, but I don't know.
6281717	6282337	It might be okay.
6284418	6285479	We'll see when it comes out.
6287039	6290601	And in other news, Typing of the Dead.
6292362	6293743	There's going to be a new version!
6294283	6295244	Yay!
6296404	6299246	It's Typing of the Dead featuring Mina no Shuko...
6300726	6302808	It would be helpful if I could pronounce this properly.
6303328	6312733	Featuring Mina no Shushoku Katsudoniki, which is pretty much the Dreamcast version with new words.
6314914	6319237	Except these look like they're... It says, Everyone's Job Hunting Diary.
6319977	6325360	So it's a job hunting site in Japan?
6325380	6325480	Yeah.
6327403	6347229	That they've teamed up with Interesting So it's like If they were to make a game These are mini games These are mini games in job hunting mode So you can type in words like Disability income And stagnant air Interesting, huh?
6349219	6378452	these people never get a job if they're just playing games all the time and last but not least is more Marvel vs. Capcom 3 stuff we have new characters we have Sir Arthur and Nathan Spencer Arthur being from Ghosts and Goblins which we talked about in part A and Nathan Spencer is from the 3D one I'm trying to see what this is
6380933	6381193	Hold on.
6382034	6382394	Yeah.
6385316	6385796	That sucks.
6386917	6388258	I'm happy about Arthur being in it.
6388298	6388819	That's pretty cool.
6391320	6393702	And we're also supposed to hear more characters later on.
6394463	6395263	So that's pretty neat.
6395904	6397145	I've already heard about the people I care about.
6398906	6399166	That's it.
6399744	6403266	Alright, looking at Twitter, we're going to go to Twitter.
6403346	6408069	Actually, real quick, I wanted to mention this because Jessica's in our chat room tonight.
6408089	6409150	She's going to be here on the show next week.
6409190	6413232	She's plugging one of the other hosts on Understation Live, Bress Lowell.
6413973	6415694	I believe this is part of Extra Life.
6416174	6419836	I was participating, playing some video games over the next 24 hours.
6419856	6421097	I'm sorry, not the next 24 hours, but on the 16th and 17th.
6422458	6422938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6444807	6445768	and donate to somebody.
6445828	6448450	Even if it's not Brestle, donate to somebody.
6448790	6451512	It's a good cause and gives gamers a good name.
6451872	6454354	It's a good fuzzy-wuzzy thing to talk about.
6454374	6457797	I was going to say, also, there was a couple other characters that they added to Marvel vs. Capcom.
6458017	6458497	Oh, what's that?
6458878	6461319	On top of... Please share.
6461540	6461920	Yes, please.
6461940	6462120	Magneto.
6464101	6465863	Cool.
6465883	6471307	The last one was because I'm not recognizing the character.
6474750	6475211	MODOK.
6475811	6478833	You ever see the big giant head thing that's just a little harness?
6480275	6482456	That's MODOK.
6482496	6484258	But what's MODOK from?
6485019	6487561	From various Marvel comics.
6488762	6489782	Really annoying character.
6490003	6490343	It's like
6493951	6495632	I forgot what MODOK stands for.
6495652	6495873	Hold on.
6497334	6499155	Can I go to Twitter topics?
6499615	6500276	Tweets time?
6501557	6501977	Tweeters?
6503298	6503919	Oh, found it.
6503979	6505800	Mental organism designed only for killing.
6506481	6508022	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6509103	6511224	It's you in a nutshell, says Loki.
6512786	6515648	Alright, going to our Twitter and looking at some of the topics.
6516128	6519991	Not a whole lot tonight, but we will get through some of these here.
6520832	6520952	Um...
6522333	6528575	Yeah, see, this first one here from PopOnJair, or as I like to read his name, PopOnJair.
6528876	6529656	It's the Popo.
6530296	6535478	PopOnJair submits us, Surely you've seen this, the most useless game accessory ever, and it's the game boat.
6535538	6536699	I remember seeing that on the Twitter.
6537159	6539900	And I just love the picture, because it's like the dude, he's on a boat!
6540980	6542761	But yeah, it looks completely useless.
6542821	6546803	About as useless as that inflatable cart that I still kind of want.
6547803	6549023	The one that's coming out this week?
6549224	6549444	Yes.
6551645	6553207	MNZiba sends us a tweet.
6553628	6557032	Nintendogs blamed for an actual dog attack.
6557944	6559245	How in the hell does this work?
6559285	6559525	Yes.
6560266	6560606	Let's see.
6561487	6570836	According to the Daily Mail, this is in the UK, Megan Walker was peacefully playing a copy of Nintendogs at a friend's house when one of the in-game dogs barked at her.
6571476	6576741	But the bark was an earshot of the friend's bull mastiff, a breed of dog that weighs about 130 pounds.
6577142	6583207	The sound spooked the dog so much that it bit Walker's face, severing a portion of her upper lip.
6584068	6584788	How sad.
6585148	6589370	The girl's grandma told the Daily Mail, I think this game should carry some kind of warning.
6589730	6592411	People should be told not to play it when there are dogs in the room.
6592851	6594392	I blame the game for what happened to Megan.
6594412	6595612	Megan will eat your face.
6595672	6598293	If they hadn't been playing it, I don't think the dog would have gone for it.
6598654	6599274	You know, lady...
6600154	6603656	Maybe you shouldn't keep a 130 pound dog near a 9 year old.
6603736	6604496	Call it a hunch.
6605236	6605916	Just a thought.
6606237	6608337	Or one that's prone to eating people's faces off.
6608357	6609018	Just thinking.
6609738	6612979	If you have a face eating dog, you might want to keep it away from your 9 year old.
6612999	6615820	If I'm right, I think a bull mastiff is the largest breed of dog.
6615840	6616641	Good God.
6617361	6618061	They're huge.
6618562	6619402	Crazy lady.
6621334	6622555	I was bit by a dog when I was five.
6622595	6623115	It's not fun.
6623276	6624176	You're afraid of dogs now.
6624296	6625457	I am, actually.
6625858	6626658	I'm getting better.
6626999	6629821	I used to be afraid of all dogs, but now it's just big dogs.
6629941	6632663	If I was around a 130-pound dog, I'd be running the other way.
6632723	6633464	I'm not even going to lie.
6633924	6639489	But now I'm at the point where Alan has talked me into getting a corgi someday.
6639529	6640810	Corgis are adorable.
6641290	6645253	And they're little, and they're cute, and they waggle, and that's adorable.
6645553	6646914	They're super cute.
6647014	6648736	But I'm mostly a kitty person.
6650123	6655991	Blue Swim is tweeting us Namco Bandai will be releasing the first Sailor Moon game on the Nintendo DS by year's end
6656528	6656928	in Italy.
6657809	6658770	No other details yet.
6658830	6663433	It will be the first new Sailor Moon game since the series was relaunched internationally early this year.
6663573	6664974	So get your Sailor Moon on.
6666856	6667636	Let's see.
6667697	6672880	Spazinator is saying, I'm doing all I can to promote OLR on Facebook, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.
6672920	6674161	Hopefully it'll get you more listeners.
6674582	6676043	You, sir, get a gold star.
6676403	6676843	Thank you.
6676924	6679405	That's all we ask is to help get the word out about OLR.
6679646	6680947	But, of course, I need to say this.
6681007	6683629	Not that I'm saying Spazinator is doing this, but just remember, guys, don't spam.
6684249	6686634	You don't have to spam people because that just makes us look bad.
6687115	6687436	Just saying.
6688438	6690281	Tasselhoff sends us a tweet.
6690602	6691383	Hey, OLR!
6692028	6694670	I like it when people spell hey, H-A-Y.
6694830	6695250	Hey!
6695711	6701555	Hey, O-L-R, what was a scene in a video game that made you shed a tear or cry because of the scene?
6702115	6705618	Oh, we were talking about this on Warcraft the other night on Vent.
6706218	6708660	Games that made you cry, that they were so sad.
6709681	6713003	I probably cried like twice during Lost Odyssey, and I didn't even beat the game.
6713804	6717267	But just the end of the first disc especially was very, very sad.
6717907	6719028	DarkSakura.com
6743038	6743759	A couple.
6744039	6745601	At least a few puzzle games.
6745761	6750426	And playing X-Men vs. Street Fighter with Dan because I'd get so pissed off at him that I'd cry.
6753329	6753910	I can admit it.
6754571	6754811	Nice.
6756690	6768263	Alright, moving on to some other tweets Oh, we've been getting this from a couple people actually Aki Ripper sends us a tweet Bejeweled is free at the moment at PopCap.com That's right, that's only for about another, what, two hours?
6768924	6775532	So sadly, too late for the podcasties But if you're listening to this now, you can get Bejeweled 2 free I gotta be honest though
6776813	6780796	I mean, how many of you don't already own Bejeweled 2 in one way or another?
6780836	6781216	I didn't.
6781516	6781716	Really?
6781756	6783017	You can play it online for free.
6783057	6783718	You always could.
6784238	6785679	I wasn't interested, but I like free shit.
6785699	6786519	What if I got the iPhone 1?
6787280	6790122	No, I had it on my old-ass phone back in the day.
6790742	6793704	I have it on the iPhone and the Xbox 360.
6794124	6798727	So I appreciate that they're giving away a free game, but it's a 10-year-old game, you guys.
6799388	6800769	No, but hey, free games are free games.
6801983	6804325	I just feel like I'm being a digital hoarder if I download that.
6804345	6805066	All right.
6805826	6811992	Spazinator PSN says, FYI, in Holmes Theater, there's an episode of Inuyasha streaming for free.
6812312	6820739	Oh, that's kind of neat that they're using the theater to stream free, like, quote unquote, real things and not just the in-house Sony stuff like the tester or whatever.
6821080	6821680	That's kind of cool.
6822461	6823842	I think they should do more of that in Sony Home.
6825803	6830507	Actdeft says Kirby's Epic Yarn was supposed to be a new IP for Nintendo.
6830947	6833409	So originally, I guess this wasn't even going to be a Kirby game.
6833429	6834010	That's kind of neat.
6834070	6835851	He's actually linking us to a story here.
6836312	6837993	I guess Iwata made some comments on this.
6839574	6840635	Originally, let's see.
6841676	6851384	It was revealed that Kirby was not going to be in the game and the original character going by the name of Fluff could have been the main character with the game carrying the title World of Yarn instead.
6852173	6860424	Which is funny given the other article that said that it was inspired by a Kirby commercial that they did in Japan in the mid-90s.
6861044	6861765	Interesting.
6863167	6863528	Let's see.
6863568	6868814	TigerClaw sends us a couple tweets and I don't remember either of these being on our show roll so I'll go ahead and mention both these stories real quick.
6868874	6869996	Again, from TigerClaw on Twitter.
6870777	6887516	Nintendo patent shows the Wii Vitality Sensor game example so I guess the patent leaked out and it kind of shows how this thing works let's see the Vitality Sensor measures a player's relax fluid sounds kind of gross it's just one of the examples of the game
6888354	6889095	Thank you for watching.
6908926	6911548	The character automatically moves as the screen scrolls to the right.
6911948	6915470	When you inhale, you fire a smiling blob's hat up towards the ceiling.
6915550	6916751	It drops when you exhale.
6917191	6920253	This game uses the vitality sensor to identify inhales and exhales.
6921614	6927078	Interesting, but again, I don't see how this is going to... They'll make a WarioWare game out of this and that's it.
6927718	6928278	You know what I mean?
6929659	6931540	There's always a WarioWare game for the peripheral.
6931560	6932221	Then it'll be done.
6933749	6941012	Also, and I remember reading about this too, and this is always sad to hear about layoffs, but Microsoft's in-game ad unit apparently is shutting down this month.
6941612	6955198	And this is a report in an ad industry trade publication, Adweek, citing sources close to the company and insiders at Microsoft stating that massive general manager JJ Richards is now seeking new employment and other unit members have been reassigned throughout the company.
6955218	6956639	So I guess only one person got laid off.
6957139	6959100	So I guess that's good that they were able to be redistributed.
6960101	6963663	Microsoft apparently had been shopping around a massive buyout in the past few months.
6964824	6975912	What this all boils down to though, I guess it's conflicts with the Xbox Live team because the Xbox Live team sells the ads directly on the Xbox dashboard and doesn't really want the competition with the in-game ads.
6976792	6977373	So there it goes.
6977453	6977653	Bye.
6980285	6980685	There you go.
6980765	6983948	That's our twits, tweets, twats for tonight.
6983988	6986230	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6986630	6987611	Thank you guys for your tweets.
6987631	6988952	We'll see you next week on the Twitter.
6989412	6993516	In the meantime, I'm going to have to go back and wake up Loki from his iPhone game.
6993556	6994236	I'm awake.
6994477	6994757	Hi.
6994777	6996418	I was playing Climber.
6996758	6997379	It's awesome.
6997399	6998460	Is that like Crazy Climber?
6998900	7006162	No, it's like if you cross Bionic Commando with a ninja, and it's all climbing really fast.
7006342	7006822	It's cool.
7007762	7008563	And it's free.
7009223	7009863	Free is awesome.
7010583	7011283	Free is awesome.
7011743	7012584	So this is kind of neat.
7013184	7023266	Apparently, AT&T U-verse is going to be offering IPTV, I guess, or streaming TV, coming to your Xbox 360.
7024187	7025327	And this is coming in November.
7026268	7028454	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7034955	7038857	So you will be able to, I guess, stream TV to it.
7039158	7045862	It says it must have at least one standard receiver or DVR in order for the Xbox as a set-top box to work.
7046542	7052125	And it says new fields will be displayed on the TV receiver section, blah, blah, blah.
7052286	7058389	Xbox connection kit will include an installation CD remote and dongle.
7058529	7059210	Dongle!
7059230	7059270	Ah!
7061658	7065203	Yes, and so I guess it's going to be coming very soon.
7065363	7069889	And I guess with the new dashboard, they'll be coming out probably very soon as well.
7070610	7072352	So that's kind of neat.
7072472	7075115	Wish I had ATT U-verse because Comcast sucks.
7076337	7078780	But I don't have that option right now.
7082250	7084852	Well, I guess that's cool.
7084992	7085473	I don't know, though.
7085493	7090536	It seems like with all these Apple TVs and Netflix and all this other stuff, this seems to be a couple years late now.
7090636	7091277	You know what I mean?
7091537	7093659	When we first heard about it in Europe, it sounded awesome.
7093899	7095040	Or was it Japan that had this first?
7095060	7095480	I don't remember.
7095860	7096601	It sounded awesome.
7096881	7104747	But now that we have all this other stuff that delivers TV shows, I mean, there's only so many ways you can watch Glee over the internets.
7104767	7105287	You know what I mean?
7105327	7107069	Do we really need this one as well?
7107449	7107569	Ew.
7107769	7109751	Oh, I forgot you're on the I Hate Glee bandwagon now.
7110731	7111892	because of the whole Beatles.
7112252	7114974	No, I was on the I Hate Glee bandwagon before then.
7114994	7115995	The show just irritates me.
7118276	7122819	I haven't watched it this season, so I can't say, but I always, in my gut, thought that show was going to be like Heroes.
7123339	7125741	Awesome first season, not so great in future seasons.
7125761	7126001	Which one?
7126021	7126261	Glee.
7126621	7127782	I haven't really been watching it lately, though.
7127802	7128763	Glee is like Heroes?
7129723	7133866	Not that it's plot, but just, you know how Heroes... This week on Heroes, it's...
7134286	7135146	Gaga Week!
7135166	7139308	You know how Heroes had an awesome first season and then its second season was like, okay?
7139768	7140448	It was, yeah.
7140908	7143869	There was the chick that was like, Maya, that was her name?
7143929	7145790	She just like single-handedly ruined the show, remember that?
7147390	7149151	My emo powers!
7150171	7151311	Exactly.
7151411	7154172	I sucked life out of you with my emo!
7154192	7154812	Exactly.
7155292	7156573	Yeah, that was a terrible season.
7157313	7158553	And it just went downhill.
7159374	7161434	Just like an emo to ruin it for everybody.
7161454	7161794	Nice.
7165940	7168021	Alright, let's see.
7168522	7172084	Oh, I wanted to give a quick update real quick because I'm catching up on my private messages.
7172384	7177687	That whole Extra Life thing I was reading about earlier, Jessica went and got a tiny URL for it.
7177727	7181890	So this is really easy if you want to participate and help Bress Lowell from Understation Live out.
7182410	7188594	Just go to tinyurl.com slash Bress Lowell, B-R-E-S-S-L-O-L.
7189615	7190295	And you can help out.
7190495	7192957	And I'll put that on the Twitter too, just in case you kids forget.
7192977	7193197	Okay.
7193922	7195543	Alright, let's move on though to some other news.
7195583	7198044	This is about one of my favorite games, Rock Band!
7198084	7198744	Yay!
7199185	7203447	Rock Band just hit 2,000 download songs this week.
7203507	7206248	Actually, that's 2,000 between download and on disc.
7206668	7210030	But however you count it, it hit its 2,000th song this week.
7210050	7212771	Potentially 2,000 songs in your Rock Band library.
7213432	7214052	Yeah, exactly.
7214072	7216173	Well, and then, does that even count the...
7218834	7220575	The Rock Band Network or whatever?
7220595	7221055	I think so.
7221115	7221535	Oh, does it?
7221935	7222556	Well, still though.
7222636	7223796	It's still an impressive number.
7224256	7227798	Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced was the 2000th song, if you care.
7227998	7229278	I was curious how many songs they had.
7230059	7230439	Stop.
7231639	7238142	By the way, if you're curious how much those have been downloaded, 75 million tracks from the Rock Band Store and the Rock Band Network.
7240009	7240809	That's a lot of downloads
7270102	7275999	There you go Bon Jovi coming soon to Rock Band DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
7276716	7277877	Oh, I've got more stuff.
7278297	7297968	How about, for those of us who are big fans of Konami's other goings-on before there was DDR, the X-Men arcade game, remember the one that was two-screen, six-player, or one-screen, four-player, is going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
7298128	7298389	Yes!
7299149	7299829	I know, right?
7299909	7300630	Dibs on Storm.
7301811	7303351	Dude, it was all about playing Dazzler for me.
7304612	7307015	but it's going to be out guess when?
7308016	7308536	Soon!
7309137	7309838	Oh, soon.
7309958	7310979	Our favorite release date.
7312821	7316004	It is all about playing Dazzler which is the only game she was ever good in.
7316845	7318006	I think it's the only game she was in.
7318726	7320307	So what about the whole six player thing?
7320327	7322468	Are we going to get to play six players online all at once?
7323168	7324028	It's going to be epic.
7324048	7325049	It doesn't say.
7325309	7327129	I was hearing a rumor about that.
7327149	7327650	Actually, yes.
7327910	7331731	They say it will retain six player co-op.
7332151	7332512	Nice.
7332892	7333272	Online.
7334032	7334272	That's right.
7334292	7340075	New York Comic Con was this weekend, so I'm sure there's a lot of news coming out of that that's comic book related, so that's kind of cool.
7341075	7342736	I just love this picture from the intro.
7342776	7344837	It's like Storm just does not give a fuck.
7344857	7345637	She's not amused.
7347618	7348398	Storm ain't having it.
7348726	7348926	No.
7349626	7350807	She's like... Because she's awesome.
7350947	7353588	Bitch, please.
7353648	7357469	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, I bet that game will come out in time for the release of the new X-Men game.
7357749	7358890	What about the new X-Men movie?
7358970	7360570	Isn't there a new X-Men movie coming out next year?
7360851	7360971	What?
7361071	7364332	Yeah, like it's First Class or something.
7364352	7365832	It's like a prequel or whatever.
7365852	7366373	I'll see it.
7367673	7368814	They recast everybody.
7369174	7372275	There was a whole comic series called X-Men First Class.
7372975	7373555	Oh, okay.
7374536	7377397	All the new original stories from the early days.
7377857	7378097	Okay.
7379505	7380607	Could be interesting, I suppose.
7381429	7384476	But it's going to be hard without Patrick Stewart as Professor X, I'm just saying.
7385758	7387382	All right, we're not going to do a listless night.
7387402	7389426	We're going to table that until next week, so let's move on with some more news.
7389466	7389667	Loki.
7391307	7393468	Yes, so this is kind of cool.
7394189	7403954	Apparently, Mega Man Legends is going to be asking people to submit ideas for stuff that they want to see in the game.
7404814	7411338	They're going to be asking the community to actively participate in different development parts.
7411738	7413779	Some of the examples that they had on the one page there.
7413820	7416641	Boss characters, voice actors, ideas.
7417082	7418463	They want them all.
7419503	7421185	Of course, that's why Project is in the title.
7421685	7426788	They said it would be a collaborative experience, but not in the way Mega Man Universe is.
7427069	7431772	Instead, I guess the community will be able to actively participate in the development of the game.
7432292	7440658	The Capcom Unity website will be updated with a dev room where fans will be able to submit their gameplay ideas, boss ideas, character ideas, and more.
7441198	7445421	In the future, fans will be able to vie for position in the game's voice cast.
7446302	7448284	Pizza Man!
7450065	7452907	Some of these character designs are really cute, the fan-submitted ones.
7453087	7454509	Yeah, they don't look bad.
7455449	7457551	I want to be a voice actor in Mega Man Legends.
7458692	7459733	Well, what do I sign up?
7460253	7461794	You just got the sign up on the website.
7461854	7462795	It's Bunny Girl!
7465297	7467078	I don't want to be a voice actor for Bunny Girl, sorry.
7469380	7470301	But yeah, it's kind of cool.
7472136	7475678	I wonder why all this audience participation in the game?
7475738	7478159	Is it just a gimmick to try and sell more copies?
7478299	7480661	Or do you think they just really want fresh ideas?
7480801	7482522	Or what do you think is the motivation behind this?
7484142	7484643	I'm not sure.
7485503	7486964	Probably just more of the...
7489418	7495520	Meta stuff because everybody likes being able to contribute to a game and having their credit and stuff.
7495580	7498360	It's way better than having a name on the form for purchasing.
7498380	7500221	It's that whole web 2.0 kind of stuff.
7501441	7501961	That makes sense.
7503261	7503622	All right.
7504642	7506482	That way fans can't bitch if the game sucks.
7507062	7508503	Because you made it.
7509183	7511343	It's all your fault the game got bad reviews.
7511964	7512224	All right.
7513844	7515024	I think this is kind of strange.
7515564	7517205	You know how there's the Kindle, right?
7517505	7519345	And I think, DarkSakura, you use the Kindle, right?
7519365	7520546	I use the Kindle app on my phone.
7521026	7522186	Is that just the same thing as the Kindle?
7522926	7523206	I don't know.
7523246	7526867	Well, the Kindle itself is the device that Amazon sells.
7527727	7528648	You know, the large one.
7528728	7530008	It's got internet access and shit.
7530168	7530348	Right.
7530788	7532949	I just have the app for it on my phone so I can read books.
7533389	7533889	Oh, okay.
7534029	7534929	Can't you use iBooks for that?
7536318	7537820	Not for books I bought through the Kindle store.
7538200	7538620	Ah, got it.
7538680	7538921	Okay.
7539341	7539881	Well, anyhow.
7539982	7541083	I bought some of my school books that way.
7541803	7543124	So I can carry them around on my iPhone.
7543425	7543745	Got it.
7543985	7544246	All right.
7544306	7544866	Well, anyhow.
7545687	7549931	Kindle is, of course, you know, it's a device that, you know, most usually you read books on it.
7550031	7554475	But now, apparently, there's some games showing up on Kindle.
7554835	7557738	I guess Scrabble is on Kindle right now.
7557818	7558579	I didn't even know that.
7558619	7561722	But, yeah, Scrabble actually made its way to the top of the Kindle charts.
7562242	7569087	But apparently some folks have ported Zork 1, Zork 2, Zork 3, and Mini Zork to the Kindle.
7569107	7570848	I didn't even know there was a Mini Zork.
7571208	7574710	But yeah, Zork 1, Zork 2, and Zork 3 are now all out on the Kindle.
7574730	7575451	That's kind of awesome.
7577032	7581655	Now, I don't think the Kindle has too much in the way of a keyboard, so I'm not sure how awesome this is.
7581715	7584437	I mean, I think it has some keyboard, but it's kind of small.
7584837	7586398	So I don't know how much fun this is to play.
7586879	7591061	But yeah, it's out there, and so you are standing in front of a white mailbox.
7591121	7591922	Don't get eaten by a Gru.
7593463	7595445	You can experience it all over again.
7597226	7597707	There it is.
7598867	7605753	Let's go to the mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we're going to open up ye olde mailbag.
7606514	7606934	Dive in.
7606954	7608175	Read the one email.
7608575	7609276	One email.
7610097	7610177	One.
7610397	7611077	One email.
7611478	7612418	But it's fantastic.
7612699	7617983	Well, to be fair, I failed on getting the show up on time, so we'll probably have double the emails next week.
7619518	7620459	Sorry, I was sick.
7620499	7621159	Leave me alone.
7621259	7622959	He brought me pita chips.
7623699	7624240	I sure did.
7624840	7625320	And a soda.
7625920	7626840	Hey, OLR crew.
7626980	7627900	AZHP here.
7628761	7636183	If you may recall, Rob had mentioned a few episodes ago that Pooping would be a funny name for a social networking site for people on the toilet.
7636363	7638903	That's right, because of Ping.com, remember?
7639304	7640884	I'm sorry, Apple's Ping.
7641567	7649070	Well, I decided to run with that idea, and I'm moderately proud to bring you www.poo-ping.com.
7650110	7650670	Wow.
7650690	7653011	I whipped it together over about two weeks.
7653972	7657833	Since I work a full-time job, I was only able to put an hour or two a day into it.
7658373	7664736	Its goal is to be like Yelp for public restrooms, though a number of factors prevent me from devoting much time to it.
7664796	7668917	The aforementioned full-time job and my lack of any sort of prowess related to design.
7670878	7671299	I don't know.
7700281	7701765	So it's not too well polished.
7702126	7707824	Maybe if I find myself unemployed in the future or if you hire Jamie, I can get back to it or she can make it look pretty.
7708726	7723078	I appreciate if the crew or the chat could throw out some ideas that you would like to see on the site, such as an iPhone app, Google Map integration, Foursquare-style check-ins, a friends list, Twitter-style updates, experience points-based ranking system for adding restrooms, etc.
7723178	7724199	I can draw you pictures of poop.
7725380	7726321	Is that really necessary?
7726381	7726581	Yes.
7727062	7727462	Who knows?
7727622	7728923	I might one day implement them.
7729564	7732046	Anyway, hope you enjoyed it as bare-bones as it is.
7732126	7734028	Your friendly neighborhood programmer, AZHP.
7735034	7735894	That's pretty amazing.
7735935	7738556	I'm looking at the site, poo-ping.com.
7738576	7739937	Put my bathroom on it.
7739957	7740337	There it is.
7740397	7741557	The site for picky poopers.
7741718	7742218	There it is.
7742878	7743819	It's actually there.
7744499	7748401	And there's already one review on there for Next Tag.
7750902	7758806	And it just talks about where there's four stalls, apparently, and there's paper towels as the hand-drying mechanism and the faucet type.
7759607	7763169	And you can actually write a review there and talk all about it.
7763809	7792627	and the comment on this restroom the faucet on the left doesn't shut off all the way unless you push down on it harder restroom is fairly clean and paper towels and toilet paper get restocked often I'm going to review the toilet at Outback I was going to say I should review the bathroom at Jack in the Box that I was at before the show tonight because when I turned on the sink it was so it was like on full blast I got shot with water and it just looked like I crapped my pants like the front of my pants and I was so mad so I was going to write a nasty review of the sink there
7793120	7794500	I love when our show inspires these ideas.
7794520	7796441	That's the ultimate tribute.
7796501	7797961	Thank you guys so much.
7812512	7815436	So Salacious Pop is saying he just thought of a mailbag for you.
7815516	7820422	He didn't send this in the email, but I think this is a great question, and I can't wait to hear the rants this inspires.
7821043	7827952	DarkSakura, have you seen the new Gap logo, and do you feel the logo would be helped by Comic Sans or Papyrus?
7828392	7829334	What the fuck?
7829354	7829894	Let me look at it.
7831138	7832359	Their logo is pretty weak.
7833219	7834680	Have you not seen the new Gap logo?
7834780	7835321	It's like crap.
7835341	7836521	They need a logo right now.
7836541	7838303	It's all this new controversy.
7838343	7839643	No, just go to Gap.com.
7839924	7840324	I'm going.
7840384	7840944	And you can see it.
7841244	7842525	And it's... There's their new logo.
7842545	7843226	It's in Helvetica.
7843506	7843706	Yeah.
7843986	7844326	That's it.
7844786	7845767	No, that's not Helvetica.
7846247	7846788	Yeah, it is.
7846848	7847688	It's Gap with a box.
7849449	7849930	I like it.
7850470	7850790	Really?
7850810	7853232	Because, like, all these designers everywhere are pissed.
7853332	7854973	They have, like, way better designs.
7854993	7856154	No, no, no, no, no.
7856494	7856614	It's...
7858456	7863799	I like the old one better, but this isn't bad.
7865800	7867461	The old one just was better.
7867501	7868261	It was more iconic.
7868541	7869962	I think the square is retarded.
7871903	7872644	Yeah, I don't know.
7872924	7875005	It's not really... No, the old one was better.
7876992	7877573	Poo-Ping.com
7893686	7896148	This is what I will say about this, if I may.
7896889	7897089	What?
7897549	7908158	If this was the first time they'd ever done a logo, as in if they hadn't had that nice one they had before, this would be fine.
7908598	7911620	Why did they feel they needed to change their logo in the first place?
7911640	7912221	It's too Swiss.
7914259	7915100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7935458	7938499	It looks like... What's that tax place?
7938519	7938979	H&R Block?
7938999	7941360	Yeah, it looks like H&R Block.
7942041	7942501	You knew that.
7942601	7943961	They changed their font from Futura.
7944321	7944622	Who did?
7944922	7945282	Ikea.
7945622	7945982	Oh, really?
7946342	7947483	They based it off of a different one.
7947943	7950524	Theirs was like a super wide version of Futura.
7951644	7952445	I like that font.
7952565	7953945	It was pretty, but they changed it.
7955446	7955846	I don't know.
7955866	7958267	It's just... Keep in mind, I love Helvetica.
7959007	7959347	A lot.
7960808	7961248	This just...
7961749	7962409	Did you see the movie?
7962970	7963630	Yes, I have.
7964050	7964631	I have a copy.
7964911	7965191	All right.
7965651	7966291	I have the book.
7967752	7968392	I'm not joking.
7968473	7969673	Is it all printed in Helvetica?
7970173	7972215	Yes, it's called Helvetica, Homage to a Tight Face.
7972795	7973295	I'll go get it.
7973475	7973995	No, it's all right.
7974476	7974836	I don't care.
7975156	7975716	No one care.
7975976	7976237	All right.
7976837	7978278	I was going to put it on the pictures.
7978338	7978778	All right, fine.
7978798	7979638	You can take a picture and all that.
7980739	7982120	We've got to get into the FUs of the week, though.
7982180	7986242	This is the part of the show where we get really angsty and get mad and throw things.
8001627	8015682	A few to my cat's butt for being too fat to lift onto her toilet box, her litter box, and pee pee in it properly.
8017785	8018826	And it's mostly my fault.
8019046	8020508	I should have exercised my cat more.
8022225	8047965	But she only is able to pee in about half of the box And the rest of the pee will get on the floor For the record, Shermie's bathroom is in the bathroom closet And we have the bottom part of the door sawed off So she can just climb under there and do her business in private But she misses the box, so the pee goes under her box And that means I have to lift her box and clean it Which is really disgusting But she has not pooped during the show
8051587	8052407	That's great!
8053808	8054948	Somebody linked us in the chatroom.
8054988	8059610	I guess there's this website where you can generate your own Gap logo and someone made OLR.
8059750	8060150	There it is.
8060170	8061911	I can do that in two seconds in Photoshop.
8062931	8063171	Nice.
8064152	8064912	That was Laser123454321.
8064932	8065232	Send that.
8068021	8069663	Alright, Loki, you have a nephew of the week.
8070564	8075191	A nephew of the week who the cats live in my backyard because they are pooping everywhere.
8076192	8077654	And it smells like poop everywhere.
8078715	8080878	And they need to leave the premise.
8083001	8083362	Is that it?
8084083	8085585	Need to leave the premise of the premises.
8087133	8115668	whatever if that's it then my FU of the week I have a few, FU to me being sick because it sucked and I've been sleeping like 12 and 13 hours this weekend which is sad because I'm not going to get to see Alan next weekend so it kind of sucks that I spent this whole weekend sleeping so yeah, boo to that boo to the fact that Midway Mania was closed to California Adventure when I went this last time so I'm very upset about that because I wanted to take Alan on that and I couldn't
8116428	8118209	But yay to us going on Tower of Terror.
8118569	8119469	That made me very happy.
8120510	8121330	No, that ride's great.
8122090	8122831	I'm glad you think so.
8123091	8123511	Let's see.
8123691	8129733	And then my last FU goes to the baggage handler at JetBlue, who I guess threw my bag.
8130013	8131994	Or either that or the people who designed my bag.
8132334	8138137	Because my laptop kind of fell out of the laptop part of my bag and into the main part of my bag.
8138217	8142799	And as it was being slung around, I now have a line of dead pixels on my monitor.
8142959	8143999	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
8144119	8144900	Yay!
8145240	8146741	I remembered one more FU that I had.
8147501	8155507	FU to Windows 7 for whatever reason, removing the What You Hear feature on the recording options on your sound card.
8155987	8160711	You know, that has been the main holdup for why Xfer and I can't do a podcast right now.
8160731	8161832	We can't figure out how to make it work.
8162312	8163313	For some reason, it works here.
8163373	8164694	Oh, we're on XP here, that's why.
8164734	8165774	You know how you do it?
8165814	8166055	How?
8166175	8166635	It's sad.
8166755	8169377	You have to do from speaker out to line in.
8170035	8170776	Oh, yeah.
8170936	8171316	No, thanks.
8172237	8172737	That sucks.
8172917	8176379	Or they say get a secondary USB sound card or something.
8176419	8177500	I've actually been looking into that.
8179802	8180242	Yeah.
8180262	8181383	Come on.
8181443	8184465	Maybe you can help me figure out why my mic isn't working for Ventrilo.
8186491	8187091	Might be similar.
8188332	8190873	I don't know why you would even remove that feature.
8190953	8191653	It's stupid.
8191753	8192273	Yeah, it sucks.
8193174	8193674	It depends.
8193874	8197736	Also, I thought it was always a Sound Blaster feature, like if you had a Sound Blaster.
8197896	8203098	Well, I have a non-Sound Blaster card in my laptop here, and I can record what I hear.
8203958	8205799	It's just, it's not, you just record it.
8206019	8211926	No, Xfer and I ran a test run the other week where we were going to and we couldn't get his Skype thing to record.
8212587	8216611	And I tried everything we do here in studio to make the show work and it wouldn't work over there.
8216851	8220616	Of course, we use an external mixing board too, which I'm sure helps, but it's just irritating.
8223599	8224220	So we'll try again.
8225922	8227583	Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.
8227603	8230784	We're gonna get to your phone calls soon, not just yet, but very soon.
8231224	8236105	In the meantime, though, we got just a couple quick stories for you guys before we open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8236725	8237786	Yes, it's interesting.
8238806	8242827	You know, Sam Raimi is working on a Earth Defense Force movie.
8242847	8249429	Now, obviously, this is not anything to do with D3 game, Earth Defense Force, the greatest game on Earth.
8250410	8254091	But it is, you know, something where, you know, apparently...
8255171	8261035	Aliens are invading and the Earth Defense Force has to, you know, stop them from invading or whatnot.
8261595	8263357	The details of the movie are very rough right now.
8263937	8277886	Here's the interesting part, though, and I'm not sure if Sam Raimi's aware of this, but apparently Earth Defense Force is actually a copyrighted name by D3, so...
8286043	8296211	EDF follows a US military unit that has been deployed to rescue a sub that has accidentally run afoul in Chinese waters.
8296871	8304317	Apparently a dogfight ensues, but both the Chinese and American planes are shot out of the water by three alien spacecrafts.
8304697	8308300	They go on to destroy landmarks and key military structures.
8308901	8314365	It's a race against the clock as humans try to create weaponry and vehicles that can sustain another attack.
8314866	8319230	Just make a goddamn fucking Earth Defense Force movie based off Earth Defense Force the game.
8319330	8322452	Well, they were going to call it The Last Airbender, but unfortunately that was taken too.
8323994	8325875	My rating is up on pooping.com.
8327497	8327757	Nice.
8328638	8329599	For the Outback Statehouse.
8330820	8331140	Bathroom.
8334795	8335836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8357114	8359056	It's going to have 3D breast wobbling.
8359436	8359876	That's right.
8359937	8363039	A whole new breast physics mechanic thing for the 3DS.
8363440	8367683	So you can see those titties titillating in full 3D.
8368444	8369585	That's just great.
8370806	8372447	I bet you guys are very excited about that.
8372827	8374169	I am.
8374269	8375510	Is this a day one purchase for you?
8375810	8375910	No.
8376270	8376391	No.
8376551	8376711	Okay.
8380054	8383697	Trust me, I don't need to purchase a game to see boobs bouncing.
8384217	8384578	I see.
8384978	8385839	You could just ask the wife.
8387780	8391383	Or just, I don't know, access the internet.
8391884	8393385	Or go outside.
8395503	8402385	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8402485	8407027	We are open for business on the Skype line if you want to say hello.
8408307	8408667	You all right?
8408687	8412148	Your chair sounded like a horn went off or something.
8412168	8412568	Is that my chair?
8412608	8413088	That was me.
8413329	8413949	Oh, that was you?
8414069	8414609	That was me.
8415509	8415629	Oh.
8415889	8417310	I'm going to crap load or something.
8418250	8420011	It sounded like a bicycle horn.
8420511	8421131	That was funny.
8422387	8423708	Okay, so last minute story.
8423768	8425308	I guess, yeah, while we wait for calls, sure.
8429871	8430451	My butt.
8430611	8437574	DarkSakura's having too much fun with that crap logo site that Laser1234531 linked us.
8437674	8438655	Yes.
8438875	8440636	So I know there's other things we can talk about here.
8442777	8445198	And let's see if our website will actually pull up my story.
8445418	8446238	Oh, well, boo-hoo.
8446399	8448019	Boo!
8448079	8449000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8449020	8449320	Who's this?
8450100	8450961	Hey, this is X-Link.
8468888	8477393	Alright, for the Democrats, at the Press A to Start screen, if you enter left 13 times, followed by the plus, you should be able to unlock them.
8477613	8484257	For the Republicans, if you press on the same screen right 13 times, followed by the plus, you will unlock them.
8486274	8486714	That's funny.
8486834	8490896	I get it, because the Democrats are on the left and the Republicans are on the right.
8491016	8491896	What if you're moderate?
8492616	8494517	Then you press down 13 times?
8494597	8494897	I don't know.
8494917	8496617	What happens if you push down 13 times?
8497578	8498418	The game crashes.
8498778	8499498	No, I don't know.
8499638	8501079	And you push nothing.
8501839	8504200	Nothing happens, because that's what happens.
8505700	8506860	Down is the tea party.
8509021	8509381	I get it.
8509821	8510101	All right.
8510681	8515042	By the way, Laser12345321 is yelling at me in chat saying, just say Laser.
8515542	8516122	We had this problem before.
8516402	8517643	I don't like just Laser.
8517703	8519083	Don't put all those numbers in your name.
8519163	8521164	I like Laser12345321.
8521204	8522204	It gives it class.
8523064	8523584	Just saying.
8524804	8526485	Change your name to Laser321contact.
8526565	8527025	It's even better.
8527745	8528445	That's even better.
8529445	8529886	I like that.
8529926	8531066	Laser321contact.
8531106	8531506	I like that.
8532492	8537635	Now I'm thinking of the 3-2-1 contact from Electric Company, but that's a whole different scenario altogether.
8537675	8538916	That's right, now it's stuck in your head.
8539537	8540517	Yes, definitely.
8541338	8553326	But no, but these two were probably one of the hardest ones for a bit, but I don't know how somebody came across it, but I was reading a few websites and somebody posted on there of how to do this, so that was quite interesting.
8553866	8556808	Because for a while they were like, here's the code to unlock...
8557958	8559079	Unlock the BC Boys.
8559119	8561240	Here's the code to unlock the ESPN.
8561380	8564082	And the rest of the stuff, you pretty much are on your own to unlock.
8564262	8566984	Well, and those codes are very easy to remember, actually.
8567224	8568445	Left 13 times.
8568465	8569566	That's not very hard to remember.
8569586	8570627	Or right 13 times.
8571007	8571787	That's not hard to remember.
8571807	8573669	That's like something I did by a fluke.
8573709	8576210	Like, oh, let me hit left and see what happens.
8576230	8579032	And then, like, all of a sudden, you know, you hit the button and it happened.
8579052	8579933	You know, you hit your chime.
8579973	8581434	And it's like, okay, what did I unlock?
8581514	8582915	Oh, look, I just unlocked, you know.
8583335	8586617	And to unlock NBA Elite, you smash the remote against the ground 13 times.
8589559	8590700	Our track to death can happen.
8590820	8593763	You can throw it out the window.
8594043	8597165	Yeah, I was going to say, it's not like any of us have bought NBA Jam yet.
8597225	8597506	I don't know.
8597546	8601008	Maybe there's a few Wii people that have bought it so far, but I sure haven't yet.
8601169	8601609	You know what?
8601629	8606973	To be honest, I was going to buy it, and then I saw the $50 price tag, and that really turned me off.
8607053	8612938	I'm like, why the hell would I pay $50 for a just updated version of the game that came out so long ago?
8613338	8614479	NBA Jam is fucking rad.
8614559	8616341	It was going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
8616401	8617502	Oh, I freaking loved it.
8617622	8618863	I loved playing in Arcade.
8618883	8625929	I remember playing all the time, going through all the teams and trying to... As soon as I beat one team with all the teams to go, you know, and it was like a weekly thing.
8625969	8627070	It was like NFL Blitz.
8627130	8629632	It did the same thing growing up with NFL Blitz.
8629652	8631614	You start with one team, you go through, and then you try...
8632034	8637356	because you're always trying to compete with everybody else in your local arcade to try to be that top number one spot.
8637476	8646320	So I wish they would have done something like that, but unfortunately, they don't have the capability of online to keep global stats of that sort, which kind of ruins it.
8646400	8649141	I mean, especially if you play just single player.
8651562	8654583	You've got to admit, though, you've got to play the Obama versus Palin.
8654623	8657064	You know you want to play that and then accuse the game of being biased.
8657985	8658765	You know you want to do that.
8659634	8664240	If the computer cheats, yes.
8665502	8667565	What do you think about Cataclysm coming out pretty soon?
8667885	8668506	And the new patch?
8676957	8677317	and DarkSakura.com.
8701520	8707503	Yeah, if it's true that the patch is hitting this week, which most people seem to kind of agree it is, it's going to be a game changer.
8707923	8708463	So we'll see.
8708583	8711004	But, you know, they always do these major patches right before.
8711464	8712305	So it'll be interesting.
8712945	8713886	Two little things real quick.
8713926	8715746	Thank you for turning me on to the game next week.
8715806	8720849	Unfortunately, I wish I got on a week before, but fortunately next week would be my one-year anniversary on WoW.
8721049	8721349	Oh, wow.
8721969	8723910	Yeah, that's really bizarre.
8723930	8724610	I was looking that up.
8724630	8725370	I was kind of curious.
8725430	8727011	And I knew it was actually next week.
8727031	8730012	Because I remember it got in before the new holiday coming up.
8730732	8732793	And it's my TDR version next week.
8732853	8734454	So it was almost the same time.
8735014	8736955	Yeah, two, get on your three games.
8737675	8742737	And three, Jamie, what are you planning on playing after you get done with Planes vs. Zombies since you've been addicted to it?
8744037	8745038	Like what game?
8745698	8747539	Yeah, what game is next for you after this?
8747579	8750600	I'm still playing Star Trek Online and Final Fantasy XIII.
8753952	8755473	So, I've got stuff on my plate.
8756413	8757434	Stuff I'm playing at the same time.
8757454	8758174	I'm still playing Sims 3.
8759254	8759654	Gotcha.
8760074	8760234	Yep.
8761735	8762055	Alright.
8762555	8763155	Well, excellent.
8763175	8765956	Before I let you go, I just got one message for you.
8766696	8766937	What?
8769898	8770218	Hold on.
8773359	8773719	Here we go.
8773899	8774319	Can you hear it?
8774359	8774999	It's really quiet.
8779561	8780181	Yeah, it's funny.
8781249	8782950	Now it's stuck in your head for the rest of the day.
8783550	8784270	Very much, yes.
8784290	8784990	There you go.
8785471	8787451	It's very much a demonic pizza song.
8789112	8793553	Contact is the moment when everything happens.
8793733	8794174	Contact.
8794354	8795274	All right, that's it.
8795634	8796294	All right, have a good one.
8796554	8796795	Bye.
8796835	8797155	You too.
8797335	8797635	Bye-bye.
8798942	8799503	What was it?
8799843	8801445	I think it was 321 Contact.
8801505	8802145	What was it?
8802285	8807951	The detective show or something that was part of that show that they had math stuff?
8807991	8810193	You're thinking of MathNet from Square One TV.
8810514	8811234	Oh, MathNet.
8811254	8812696	You're thinking of MathNet.
8813116	8813717	Oh, my God.
8814037	8814958	I'm not even going to play.
8815038	8817060	It used to be all about MathNet.
8817420	8818321	That show was awesome.
8818461	8819122	It was awesome.
8819523	8821605	And then Friday was the all MathNet show.
8825560	8826301	Square One is pretty cool.
8844465	8845546	I kind of miss the old shows.
8845726	8853991	If you want to give us a call and stop us from playing retro TV songs, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8854032	8856593	Let's see, they have actually all these episodes of MathNet.
8856613	8857494	That's awesome.
8857634	8860176	I'm going to assume probably one of these.
8862317	8863138	MathNet, frankly.
8863478	8865139	Hello, Walter.
8867100	8867381	Really?
8868742	8869302	Are you sure?
8871483	8872744	Okay, we'll be right there.
8874915	8877437	Dude, you know what would be awesome?
8877757	8879518	The new Law & Order series.
8880999	8882240	Law & Order MathNet.
8887123	8888964	That would be so awesome.
8897550	8900692	This week on Law & Order, somebody divides by zero.
8906828	8909130	Juju Rockets Headed for the iPad
8929630	8931291	Dead Rising Mobile Capcom Arcade
8948627	8955573	which will host a bunch of virtual arcade cabinets that require the purchase of tokens to play the games.
8955593	8956614	Interesting.
8956634	8960637	Otherwise, you can permanently access each game for a larger one-time fee.
8961558	8970925	The arcade service will launch before Dead Rising Mobile and will feature Street Fighter 2, Ghouls and Ghosts, 1942, and Commando.
8971686	8976570	So this is why no one else wants to get on board with Game Room because now they're like, well, let's just do our own shit.
8977110	8977670	Exactly.
8977810	8978331	Oh no.
8978991	8982853	Another full motion video game is coming to the App Store as well.
8983553	8985033	This one is kind of a neat one.
8985073	8987194	I remember drawing some of the characters from it.
8987294	8992397	Braindead 13 is coming as well to the App Store very soon.
8994698	9000583	Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Super Monkey Ball, and Phantasy Star 2 are all discounted on iTunes right now.
9001143	9005546	You can get those all for about $1.99 instead of $6 each.
9005687	9006747	But they suck on the iPhone.
9007168	9008429	I'm not going to mince words.
9008449	9009710	Super Monkey Ball is not bad.
9011091	9028585	Okay, I'll give you that But these other ones, honestly If you have a 360 or a PS3 Go get that Genesis collection The Sonic Mega Genesis collection It's like in the bargain bin right now You can probably find it for $10 And it's fantastic And it's like the greatest $10 you'll spend If you like the retro stuff If you don't like the retro stuff, then don't bother
9029065	9037893	But otherwise, if that last story sounded interesting to you and you own a 360 or a PS3, go buy the Mega Genesis Collection.
9038153	9039474	It's a much better deal.
9040015	9040475	Trust me.
9041576	9044399	And then Minecraft is being updated for Halloween.
9045099	9047541	They're adding new months.
9047742	9054628	Seriously, I leave the show for two weeks and suddenly, just in general, gaming news in general, suddenly I come back and it's like, Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft.
9054708	9055969	Everybody's talking about Minecraft.
9056829	9058350	I'm just covering what people want to know.
9078878	9082200	Anyways, it's going to include some new monsters.
9083682	9094271	Apparently, torches that extinguish over time, fishing, and the ability to fast travel by moving through, I guess, a hell world.
9095111	9096813	And the craftable wristwatch.
9097894	9102938	They'll let players track how much time is left in the day before the bad guys come out.
9106038	9109801	877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR 877-GAME-OLR
9131023	9132685	Damn it, people, call us!
9132785	9133745	I didn't have the light red.
9134126	9134986	That's the thing.
9135126	9136808	I had that more rare red color.
9139910	9140610	Good times.
9140630	9144113	877-GAME-OLRR Use name on Skype is Orange Laundry.
9144433	9152159	Isn't it weird to think that everything you're seeing there, that theater that you're seeing all those pictures in, that's now the parking lot for the Best Buy.
9154461	9155741	You park your cars there now.
9155822	9156602	It's sad.
9157042	9159124	And then they have something else that they're building that looks like a theater.
9160327	9161728	It's a sports authority store.
9162208	9163348	Ah, lame.
9163408	9165889	That's the same reaction I had.
9167030	9169430	No one wants to go to the sports authority.
9170691	9171951	It's the same reaction I had.
9171991	9173192	Was Travis Columbia?
9173812	9175113	In that particular night, yes.
9175333	9176753	That's fantastic.
9176833	9183276	That particular night was the switch night or tacky horror, they sometimes call it, where the guys play girl parts and the girls play guy parts.
9183336	9184696	That's why there's pictures of me as Magenta.
9184796	9186837	You played a good Magenta.
9187617	9189618	Magenta is my favorite character in the whole movie.
9191469	9214095	we did some awesome theme nights good times Jess will be here next week we can reminisce about this shit all night we can do another marathon show just out of that I was a rope that was the cast after Under Station you were kind of helping out after the theater was torn down it was Further Indignities was the name of that crowd and remember I got Dr. Scott once
9214775	9230748	That's right, you did Jessica's in chat saying we need to go do the time warp in the parking lot on February 3rd Because that'll be 10 years since the theater shut down Did you ever pick up that game, was it the Broadway something or other?
9231029	9233951	The one that's just dance but with all the Broadway songs?
9234011	9238575	Not until it's in the $5 bin, come on, let's be honest It's gotta be in the $5 bin now I'll have to look
9240595	9240895	I don't know.
9240915	9242396	It came out back in June.
9242416	9246339	I can't imagine that I've sold a copy of it since.
9246639	9247220	I guess that's it.
9247240	9248681	We're not getting any of the calls tonight.
9248741	9249401	Damn it, people.
9249441	9250242	What's wrong with you?
9251082	9252023	Everybody's being shy.
9252483	9253024	Call.
9253044	9253724	I guess that's it.
9254445	9255565	I'm going to shut it down in a minute.
9255585	9256526	I'm going to give it another minute.
9256906	9257967	Shut it down.
9258047	9258747	Shut it down.
9258908	9259868	You all fail.
9261689	9263471	Dan's in the other room going, terminated.
9263971	9264972	Was Dan on the show last week?
9265012	9265892	Did he help you kids out?
9266233	9266473	No.
9266973	9267654	Oh, he wasn't.
9268214	9268474	No.
9268954	9269655	He ran...
9272632	9275198	Dan, you want to come be on the show?
9275218	9275258	No.
9276942	9277664	No, he says no.
9278486	9278907	How rude.
9280026	9280927	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9305029	9305389	Call 1-8... Call...
9331287	9333428	Go on iTunes and leave a nice review for us.
9333628	9334149	Leave us an 8.
9335049	9337972	Leave us an 8 out of 5 star review on iTunes.
9338312	9339893	Just tell a couple friends about the show.
9339993	9343296	Help spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.
9343796	9347139	It's just some nerds who do this for fun, who've been doing this way too long.
9348219	9348640	In a good way.
9349400	9353163	Anyhow, before we pull the plug on the show, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
9353643	9354664	Loki, start us off tonight.
9354684	9355225	Your final thought.
9356305	9363550	My final thought is I am looking forward to getting my new laptop so I can finish my mods for Grand Theft Auto 4.
9363690	9372175	I am very disappointed that I ran into two people trying to rip me off in auctions and in purchases.
9372955	9374615	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
9374635	9375076	I want ice cream.
9398735	9400356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9428942	9429643	I'm on ice cream.
9430043	9430583	Okay.
9430664	9431765	Let's go to Baskin Robbins.
9431905	9432225	That's fine.
9432445	9432705	All right.
9432805	9433166	That's it.
9433226	9433606	We're done.
9433646	9434047	We're out.
9434087	9434687	Pulling the plug.
9434727	9437149	We will see you here next week for episode 386.
9437269	9438851	It's going to be very special.
9438891	9446557	Kind of look back on 10 years of DDR for me and Iguana Girl, Jessica Harper, whatever other name she has.
9446577	9448980	I'm trying to think about when my 10th anniversary was.
9449000	9450241	You played before me.
9450401	9450841	I know that.
9451222	9451402	Yeah.
9451462	9454064	And Loki, I think, started playing a little later, right?
9454344	9454524	So...
9455986	9460011	I started playing it was after Fanime one of those years.
9460091	9461673	But that's early in the year.
9462875	9464677	God, I don't remember when I started playing.
9464697	9466900	Because I had gotten a fourth mix.
9467341	9468462	I imported a fourth mix.
9469464	9472728	My first machine was an AX2001 at Disneyland.
9474400	9477422	That's not too far off then, your first machine.
9477442	9481625	But my first time playing DDR was in December of 99.
9482646	9484307	Well, regardless... No, not 99, because I had...
9487152	9487673	Yeah, December 99.
9488193	9493938	Technically, my first time seeing DDR was Memorial Day of 99.
9493978	9495198	No, of 2000.
9495539	9495979	Yeah.
9496279	9496459	No, 99.
9496880	9499942	Because I gave you third mix.
9499962	9501764	Because that weekend holds other special significance.
9501784	9502824	I gave you third mix afterwards.
9503585	9503785	Yes.
9504065	9505186	After you played Machine.
9505286	9508469	But regardless, we're going to have a 10-year look back next week just because.
9508529	9508649	Yay!
9508889	9509430	So that's it.
9509830	9510831	Have a great night, everybody.
9510891	9511511	We'll see you next time.
9511551	9512372	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
9512392	9514554	You need to chastise your boyfriend.
9514694	9514874	Why?
9514914	9515455	What did you do?
9515895	9516996	Sidno Pinkberry.
9517757	9519258	Lecture, lecture, lecture.
9519698	9520779	Point, point, point.
9521079	9521800	Shake, shake, shake.
9522335	9524456	Let's go to San Francisco and get Naya next weekend.
9525997	9527418	I have to go to a wedding next weekend.
9528779	9532061	Speaking of this, it's all Rocky people that are getting married next week.
9532261	9533022	Is it a Rocky wedding?
9533062	9534543	It's actually somebody Jessica would know.
9534563	9535143	I'll have to tell her.
9535343	9536104	Is it a Rocky wedding?
9537004	9538065	No, it's not a Rocky themed wedding.
9538085	9538766	It's a legit wedding.
9540066	9540667	That's no fun.
9541047	9543251	Yeah, but I'm going to a wedding next weekend.
9543271	9544673	So anyway, but I will be here for the show.
9545294	9545555	Okay.
9545695	9546797	Okay.
9547017	9547498	I'm sorry.
9547558	9548479	Yes, I will be here for the show.
