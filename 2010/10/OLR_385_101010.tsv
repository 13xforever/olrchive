0	20720	Tonight, October 10th, 2010, DC Universe Online faces a delay, OnLive gets cheaper to use,
20720	32080	and another classic arcade game is set for revival on this gents consoles.
32080	36160	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
36160	37320	Lounge Radio.
37320	39960	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39960	44440	We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
44440	46760	And we don't forget the episode number.
46760	47760	www.allgames.com.
47760	49560	I always forget the episode number.
49560	52640	It's episode 385 for those that are still counting.
52640	56720	The smartass you hear over there in the corner is my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark
56720	58760	Sakura, Jamie Summers.
58760	59760	How are you?
59760	61840	I'm inhaling bacon fumes and it's not kosher.
61840	66480	I know, this whole room is not kosher at this very moment.
66480	70040	You're helping to balance, give this room kosher balance.
70040	74040	Say hello to the fan of double bacon pizza, Loki.
74040	76480	Because I've tried triple bacon pizza and that's just too much.
76480	77480	That's too much bacon.
77480	78480	And we did that on a large.
78480	83400	I mean, that was a lot of pizza or a lot of bacon because I remember we're like, I wonder
83400	87080	because there's a, there used to be a guy when I was working at Roundtable that would
87080	89320	order a quadruple sausage pizza.
89320	94520	It literally is like a three quarter inch thick layer of sausage that's just on top
94520	95520	of the pizza.
95520	98600	For those that don't know, Roundtable is a big pizza chain on the West Coast.
98600	100880	The whole West Coast or just California?
100880	101880	Mostly California.
101880	105600	You can make it work if you did extra cheese, triple bacon.
105600	106600	You're right.
106600	111200	The problem was it was too greasy and actually the point is actually you couldn't really
111200	112680	taste the pizza with the bacon.
112680	115780	This is actually really sweet because the sauce is really sweet.
115780	119560	But it might be able to work with like two and a half times bacon.
119560	120960	It would work if it was on a rack.
120960	124120	Do you remember there was an episode probably about two years ago, maybe a year ago, where
124120	126980	you brought like all these bacon dishes to the show?
126980	131240	Like I never thought in my life that I would ever say this is too much bacon.
131240	132240	That was last year.
132240	133240	That was too much bacon.
133240	134240	Was it last year?
134240	135240	That was my birthday last year.
135240	136240	That was actually really good.
136240	137240	That was a lot of bacon.
137240	138520	But there was so much bacon left over.
138520	139520	Yes, there was.
139520	140520	It was too much.
140520	142800	And you guys left it at my house.
142800	149400	I would probably do just like a meat party instead because seriously, bacon, even cooking
149400	152720	it the entire day, it just doesn't get, it's not very good.
152720	155040	Now steak party, that's good.
155040	158240	That sounds like a game that they should sell on the shelves of Target right between like
158240	160080	Blind Date and Mall Madness.
160080	161560	Meat party.
161560	163160	That totally could not be here.
163160	165600	I only eat meat once a month.
165600	167200	Well they'll have to be on that day.
167200	168200	All right.
168200	169200	Anyhow.
169200	170200	Hi.
170200	171360	I missed you guys last week.
171360	173880	My aim is still improving ever so much though.
173880	174880	But you know.
174880	175880	Oh we did fine without you Rob.
175880	176880	You can just go home if you want.
176880	177880	Okay bye.
177880	178880	No I'm kidding.
178880	182480	No well actually I turned on the show while I was at the airport just to make sure that
182480	184640	you guys like were alive.
184640	186400	Because you didn't trust us.
186400	189360	Well I don't, you'd never had done it before so I just want to make sure you didn't get
189360	190360	into a train wreck.
190360	191520	You know what I mean?
191520	194700	And then you guys, I heard like five seconds of the show, you guys were on the phone with
194700	198240	Aki Ripper and I'm like oh okay they're already into calls so they're done bye.
198240	199760	And then after that everything fell apart.
199760	200760	No it didn't really.
200760	201760	It's because I tuned in.
201760	202760	We kept losing the stream.
202760	204480	It's because I tuned in.
204480	206320	So what did I miss on last week's show?
206320	207920	I have not heard it yet.
207920	211240	And I apologize to the podcastees because they, I mean by the time they hear this they'll
211240	212240	be okay.
212240	213240	You missed Tiara.
213240	216000	Well I've talked to Tiara before.
216000	217000	I know she's a fun gal.
217000	218000	I enjoy her.
218000	219840	But you missed her fun hosting capabilities.
219840	222660	Did she did she do the Rob role where she kept you all in check?
222660	225200	Make sure you were following the show role?
225200	226200	Did she?
226200	227200	Yeah.
227200	228200	Yeah.
228200	229200	Great.
229200	233280	I'm sure that show was awesome.
233280	234280	No I'm kidding.
234280	237360	I think I skipped a story once and then we went back and did it.
237360	238360	All right.
238360	241640	Well I'm glad to hear things were good and that means I can take vacations more often.
241640	244080	It's better than the last time we tried to run the show without you.
244080	247280	Wasn't that the show where you ended up watching like a porno?
247280	248280	Yeah.
248280	249280	Good times.
249280	250280	Good times.
250280	255960	Well I went to Disneyland last week as you guys know and I had a good time and yeah I'm
255960	257680	fresh out of Space Mountain.
257680	260340	But Dark Soccer and I are still trying to get the December 17th thing to work.
260340	263880	We got to just cross the T's and dot the I's and all that stuff.
263880	267720	I have an annual pass again so going back won't be a problem for me.
267720	271560	And I saw some of the pictures from Electronica which started this week and they actually
271560	274720	have a whole little Flynn's arcade with like 80s old school video games.
274720	275720	We're there.
275720	276720	I know it's gonna be fun.
276720	277720	We're going.
277720	278720	Good times.
278720	279720	Anyhow.
279720	280720	No one.
280720	281720	No one.
281720	282720	No one.
282720	283720	And if they try.
283720	284720	Except maybe the bank.
284720	285720	Smite.
285720	286720	Maybe the bank.
286720	287720	The bank could stop us.
287720	288720	All right.
288720	289720	Smite.
289720	290720	Let's start off the show.
290720	291720	Let's see.
291720	292720	We've talked about food.
292720	293720	We've talked about Disneyland.
293720	294720	Is there anything else we talk about on this show?
294720	295720	Oh yeah.
295720	296720	Video games.
296720	297720	Once in a while we talk about video games.
297720	298720	How about Rainbow Farting Universe?
298720	299720	Here on the show.
299720	300720	No.
300720	301720	Seriously.
301720	302720	Someone.
302720	303720	All right.
303720	304720	I was at Outback last night for my one steak a month.
304720	305720	Quit.
305720	306720	I quit.
306720	307720	I'm going back to Disneyland.
307720	308720	And I did my.
308720	309720	And someone says, do you need anything else?
309720	310720	Do you want anything else?
310720	311720	I say, yeah.
311720	312720	Like a pony, please.
312720	313720	And she said, oh.
313720	317720	And the girl said, my friend Jamie always asks for a unicorn that poops rainbows.
317720	320560	And I was like, my name is Jamie.
320560	322200	And she's like, oh wow.
322200	326040	My answer would be, how would you like that cook?
326040	327040	I would.
327040	328040	I guess you had to be there.
328040	329040	All right.
329040	330040	It was funny.
330040	332040	I'm sleep deprived.
332040	333040	Rob got.
333040	334040	Rob brought me caffeine.
334040	335040	Unprompted.
335040	336040	Well here.
336040	338240	Well, cause I know it puts you in a good mood and I don't wanna have to deal with a bitch
338240	339240	Jamie all night.
339240	340240	Anyway.
340240	341240	Love hearts.
341240	343520	Um, here's the thing.
343520	344520	Here's the thing.
344520	348160	I see some folks in chat complaining that the podcast is not yet uploaded from last
348160	349160	week.
349160	352640	And I swear I'm not doing it out of a spite.
352640	353640	No, here's the deal.
353640	356080	I got like super sick.
356080	357080	I had to miss.
357080	358920	I missed a day at Disneyland due to being sick.
358920	363400	I made Alan go to the park without me on Sunday and I thought I was getting better come Monday.
363400	365940	But then like Tuesday, the day I was supposed to come over and get all the show stuff taken
365940	366940	care of.
366940	367940	I had the worst fever.
367940	371360	I had to call in sick to work and that that's a big deal for me to call in sick to work.
371360	372360	Cause I really don't.
372360	373360	Rob has amazing work ethic.
373360	376120	Fantastic rib places across the street from Disneyland.
376120	377720	Actually we did eat at Tony Roma's.
377720	382480	Yes, we did eat there actually.
382480	383480	That's right.
383480	384480	I haven't seen him in forever.
384480	385480	Yeah.
385480	386480	So, all right.
386480	387480	Anyhow.
387480	390920	Tony Stark's house of ribs.
390920	393520	All right.
393520	397800	I'm just reading the chat and a salacious pop is just going, wow, Rob, you can't.
397800	399880	I was, I was mean to Jamie.
399880	401520	I didn't mean it.
401520	402520	Come on.
402520	404160	You guys, I have to, I have to razzle on the show.
404160	405160	I got him.
405160	406320	I got last week to make up for.
406320	408880	Come on you guys.
408880	410320	And your, your mic sucks.
410320	411320	That is not a lie.
411320	412920	I went, you went to the place without me.
412920	413920	I know.
413920	414920	I'm sorry.
414920	415920	All right.
415920	418780	Let's talk about, cause we do talk about video games once in a while on the show.
418780	420860	How was your gaming week and dark soccer?
420860	421860	How was your game?
421860	423120	We, we really, really do need to get the mic cord.
423120	426560	I thought for some reason my cord here, I pushed it out last week.
426560	427560	All right.
427560	428560	We'll just get anyone.
428560	430120	I think it got loose is what it is.
430120	431120	It's loose.
431120	432120	Like a hoo-er.
432120	438760	Um, I, I was going to play Final Fantasy 13 and didn't.
438760	443840	Dan's been in there with our friend George over here playing Halo Reach all day and I
443840	448560	played Star Trek online and I'm doing, I've got actually until tomorrow to finish the
448560	455360	other three missions in this whole Breen thing so that I can get my free Breen tactical officer
455360	459460	because I have a shit ton of homework to do the rest of the week.
459460	462040	So J busy, Jamie is busy.
462040	464560	Um, I played lots of plants versus zombies.
464560	468560	I played in our bacular drop, which we know that is right.
468560	469560	Yeah.
469560	470680	The bonus moments in the game, right?
470680	472680	The precursor to portal.
472680	481640	Oh, the game that, oh yeah, I'm not any good at it and it's like, it's a neat concept.
481640	488240	I mean, but I'm glad that portal made it less, uh, Clippy, if you know what I mean with fewer
488240	490200	trolls in it.
490200	495520	Um, and then what else did I play?
495520	501120	Um, no, a lot of plants versus zombies, a whole lot of plants versus zombies.
501120	502120	You beat it yet.
502120	503120	I don't know.
503120	504120	Yeah.
504120	505120	Is it beatable?
505120	506120	I don't know.
506120	507120	Yeah.
507120	508120	You can beat adventure mode and then you do it again.
508120	509120	I've played it a couple of times, but never for an extended period of time.
509120	515500	So now I'm trying to do the, uh, the no fungus among us achievement where you don't use fungus
515500	517120	at night or something.
517120	519120	I don't know.
519120	525000	Um, no, no, I know I played something else.
525000	526000	I just can't remember what it is.
526000	528680	Dan's played a whole lot of Mega Man.
528680	529680	Like old school Mega Man?
529680	530680	Like NES Mega Man?
530680	531920	Mega Man 4 Game Boy edition.
531920	533380	That's random.
533380	535600	What makes a person think I want to play Mega Man 4 on the Game Boy?
535600	537000	He's been watching Mega Man playthroughs.
537000	538000	Oh, okay.
538000	540000	So my husband's a dork.
540000	541000	All right.
541000	542000	Heart.
542000	545240	I think the Mega Man collection on a GameCube is still an awesome game to have because you
545240	547800	know those GameCubes can, you can still play them on the Wii.
547800	548800	Yeah.
548800	551320	So it's still a good collection to have or the PS2, whatever, whatever one you want.
551320	555600	Some people don't like the GameCube one cause I think the buttons are swapped or something.
555600	556600	So but it's fine.
556600	557600	It doesn't bother me.
557600	558600	Either way is fine.
558600	559880	You're not bothered Rob.
559880	560880	No.
560880	564680	And um, I've been keeping Super Metroid all warm and cozy for you.
564680	565680	Awesome.
565680	566680	Yeah.
566680	567680	We played a little bit of that last.
567680	570440	Cause I wasn't here on the last show, but I don't know if you mentioned it, but yeah,
570440	571840	I came over at like that Tuesday.
571840	572840	We played some Super Metroid.
572840	573840	It was good times.
573840	575680	And we beat turtle after you left.
575680	576680	Did you?
576680	577680	Yeah.
577680	578680	Good times.
578680	581680	I had to switch to Donatello.
581680	583160	I like the long stick.
583160	584160	Oh my.
584160	585960	Loki, how was your gaming week?
585960	588120	Um, it was okay.
588120	589120	I didn't play a whole lot.
589120	592120	I played mainly uh, Grand Theft Auto.
592120	596080	Um, you know, more Grand Theft Auto 4, Lost and Damned.
596080	597240	Still play more multiplayer.
597240	602880	I am really pissing off my coworkers because I'm, I keep winning a lot and I've actually
602880	609100	had to draft up a printed out form letter for apologies for beating them at certain
609100	612180	things that I, I fill out.
612180	618160	So um, I don't know if that adds insult to injury or what, but it's what they requested.
618160	620360	So I'm sorry that you suck.
620360	624280	That sounds like you had to like make your amends to your coworkers.
624280	628400	Like it's because, okay, the game is so lagging out.
628400	633520	Like um, I think they shut down some servers or something when they're, when they moved
633520	636880	on to new expansion and Red Dead Redemption, that kind of stuff.
636880	642720	So the game, it gets a little laggy sometimes and sometimes things just seem to go my way.
642720	648080	Like um, you know, they'll be coming to attack me and all of a sudden a car hits them and
648080	654040	they get knocked over and I turn around and shoot them in the face or uh, I, you know,
654040	658960	my big thing now that I've been come, you know, kind of become fascinated with is climbing
658960	659960	up buildings.
659960	664440	Like I'm totally this like massive free runner in that damn game now.
664440	665440	It's ridiculous.
665440	667840	Like the, how the fuck did you get on top of that skyscraper?
667840	668840	It's like you're Spiderman.
668840	671360	It's seriously, I'm like Spiderman in that game.
671360	672360	It's ridiculous.
672360	679620	Um, and there's a lot of places in, especially in Algonquin that you can just climb up to
679620	684540	the top of buildings and there's so many like fire escapes you can get to and it's ridiculous.
684540	686760	So you had to write your coworkers apology letters.
686760	689760	Like were they like at the point where, we're not playing with you again cause you're a
689760	690760	jerk.
690760	692760	They're getting pretty pissed off at me.
692760	693760	It's bad.
693760	695840	It's, it sounds like you had to write your amends letters.
695840	699180	Like one of the things I was doing when I was sick is I was watching a lot of intervention
699180	703960	on A&E and one of the episodes I was watching was the follow up episode to the chick that
703960	704960	inhales computer duster.
704960	707840	Did you ever see this episode of the chick who inhales the computer duster?
707840	711760	It's like I'm walking on sunshine.
711760	712760	She's walking on sunshine.
712760	715040	It's like I'm walking on sunshine.
715040	718880	But anyways, inhaling computer duster, it's toughing.
718880	719880	It's toughing.
719880	722560	It's some way kids get high and it's really dangerous.
722560	723560	Don't do it.
723560	724560	Really, really dangerous.
724560	725560	Like you do a whipped cream.
725560	726560	I guess.
726560	727560	Yeah, like that whole thing.
727560	728560	So that's where that South Park thing came from.
728560	729560	Yes.
729560	730560	That's where the towel thing on South Park comes from.
730560	734120	But anyway, they had like a follow up episode to her and she, as part of the follow up,
734120	735260	she's, she's all better now.
735260	736920	So, you know, hooray for her.
736920	738480	And she's, she's not doing that stuff anymore.
738480	739600	One thing she had to do was make amends.
739600	741720	So she had to like write a letter to the police.
741720	745240	Like, I'm sorry, I put up a fight when you try to arrest me and dah, dah, dah.
745240	746720	And write to the people at Walmart.
746720	750020	I'm sorry that I would come in every day and buy 10 cans of computer duster.
750020	753160	So like it sounds like Loki is like having to write amends to his coworkers.
753160	757880	Like I'm sorry that I repeatedly beat your ass at Grand Theft Auto and I'm sorry you
757880	759520	can't handle it.
759520	762360	Sorry you suck.
762360	763480	It's not necessary.
763480	768480	It's only when like, you know, really ridiculous things happen that, you know, shouldn't happen
768480	770320	normally in the circumstances of the game.
770320	773640	So I don't know, whatever.
773640	777880	Other things I played other than Grand Theft Auto, I did play a little bit of Dead Rising
777880	778880	2.
778880	780840	And I really do mean a little bit.
780840	787960	I mean I only got to the part where they get into the, what is it, the shelter and that's
787960	788960	it.
788960	792800	I mean that's like literally five minutes into the game.
792800	793800	It's cool though.
793800	795400	I am really excited to play the rest of the game.
795400	798040	I just really pressed on time.
798040	802880	The other thing of course, obviously since I have my iPod with me a lot during work hours
802880	807880	and you know, when I'm watching the baby, I've been playing a lot of Geared, which is
807880	811280	a puzzle game with gears that you have to move different gears around to try to get
811280	812960	all the gears to spin.
812960	814520	And it's pretty fun.
814520	816720	It's kind of addicting.
816720	824940	I am digging though this one app on there called the free app watcher, or free app tracker.
824940	830060	And they'll basically track or let you know when apps drop in price to free.
830060	833280	So you can go on there and browse through there and download games that would normally
833280	837920	cost you money because they're either trying to promote them or whatever.
837920	843240	So that's kind of cool, a great way to get a bunch of free shit.
843240	844880	So yeah, that's pretty much what I've been playing.
844880	848440	I'm excited to get a new laptop this week that will actually be able to run Grand Theft
848440	852720	Auto on it so I can do my editing at work because that's really the only time I'd actually
852720	857480	have to do mods for the Xbox 360 version.
857480	861960	Plus I can run other things on there and I'm possibly going to download Minecraft now since
861960	863800	everybody keeps talking about it and I got to see what this thing is.
863800	867680	I somehow missed the boat on all this Minecraft stuff because it's just really happened in
867680	872160	the past couple weeks, but why is everybody all gung ho about Minecraft?
872160	874160	I somehow missed this while I was on vacation.
874160	877880	It went free for a while while they were fixing some server issues or something and once people
877880	879680	start playing they're like, oh my god, it's addictive.
879680	884720	It's basically a game you go in and you create stuff.
884720	885720	And then there's monsters.
885720	887440	There's a lot of games like that in there.
887440	889720	Well yeah, but this is really addicting apparently.
889720	890720	Okay, I'll have to try it.
890720	891720	I mean, don't knock it till you try it.
891720	892720	I've heard a lot of things about it.
892720	897160	To the point where there's someone like recreating the Star Trek Enterprise full scale in the
897160	898160	game.
898160	899160	That's cool.
899160	900640	So it's kind of like Legos but a game.
900640	901640	Something like that.
901640	904920	It's like Leo Universe, but not.
904920	909120	We've created a new game in the chat called Poopville.
909120	912840	I'm looking at our chat room chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday
912840	916440	evening and that's chat.orangelandraday.com and I see all this talk about Farmville.
916440	918640	I think the whole talk about addiction and intervention.
918640	920920	My mom's addicted to Farmville.
920920	921920	Wow.
921920	924000	And I'm looking at a defective candy in our chat room.
924000	925000	That's not a name I've seen before.
925000	926000	I don't think so.
926000	927000	Hi.
927000	930180	I just shake my head with shame whenever someone comes in and buys one of those Farmville cards
930180	933920	for work and like wow people really do buy those.
933920	938280	But you know what actually I can relate this to Disneyland a little bit.
938280	942280	You know I do the pin trading at Disneyland and I always buy like a generic pin set to
942280	946800	trade away to people to because the employees trade with you and it's this whole little
946800	949280	like weird game you play while you're at the parks.
949280	953280	So I bought a pack of starter pins and you know what the pack was that I bought of starter
953280	954280	pins?
954280	956000	Club Penguin.
956000	960100	And like almost all day long people kept asking me like what are those pins?
960100	961100	What is it?
961100	964360	And I'm having to like explain Club Penguin to people which is weird because I've never
964360	965360	played it.
965360	970380	But it's one of those like Disney style Farmville-esque MMOs and they sell those cards right next
970380	971740	to the Farmville cards at the store.
971740	973760	But it's more for kids because it's Disney.
973760	976880	So yeah people actually buy that stuff.
976880	981720	But I mean the kids stuff I get because the kids stuff you really have to ration.
981720	985120	I get that a little more but the adult stuff it's like oh boy.
985120	986120	Oh boy.
986120	991680	Yeah so again if you want to join us in chat chat.orangelaundryday.com.
991680	993360	Anything else you want to mention about your gaming week?
993360	994360	Loki are you all done?
994360	995360	You all done?
995360	996360	I'm done.
996360	997360	All right.
997360	1000280	I don't think I have a whole lot for my gaming week I gotta be honest since I was out for
1000280	1003200	five days and then I was sick I didn't do a whole lot of gaming.
1003200	1004200	Just a lot of sleeping.
1004200	1008760	I did play some more World of Warcraft because you know I'm a little yeah shut up.
1008760	1012020	Hey my guild is nine of twelve now in ICC finally.
1012020	1013020	We're almost there.
1013020	1014020	Sounds like a Borg designation.
1014020	1015200	Doesn't it?
1015200	1018960	We just have to get Putricide and Cindergosa and then we'll be on our way to the Lich King.
1018960	1021120	So we're progressing along nicely there.
1021120	1025280	I did a 25 man run over the weekend that was it was interesting.
1025280	1028200	It got a little it was a little slow to start so in a little later than I thought.
1028200	1031260	I don't feel so bad about my Breen thing now.
1031260	1032260	What's that?
1032260	1033260	Your what thing?
1033260	1034260	Breen.
1034260	1035260	What's that?
1035260	1036260	They're a race in Star Trek.
1036260	1039640	Oh is this like a thing you're trying to like you have to grind a lot to get to play them
1039640	1040640	or?
1040640	1041640	No no.
1041640	1043800	And I'll tell everyone right now who's playing Star Trek online.
1043800	1047060	They have me they're having a special that if you do the Breen episodes there's five
1047060	1052480	of them when you finish the last episode you get a Breen tactical officer.
1052480	1053480	Only until the 14th.
1053480	1054480	Wow.
1054480	1055480	So that's what I'm doing.
1055480	1057240	Only I've got tomorrow to finish it.
1057240	1058240	Random.
1058240	1060620	I'm sorry but I'm saying now I don't feel so bad about my Breen.
1060620	1061720	That's all right.
1061720	1063760	There's holiday events and wow that are just as bad.
1063760	1066760	So yeah it's mostly been that because you know I was away for five days and then I was
1066760	1069160	sick and everything so I haven't been playing a whole lot.
1069160	1073000	Plus I spent a lot more at Disneyland than I should have.
1073000	1076380	So I've been scaling back in other ways like I was going to get the Castlevania game this
1076380	1079040	week but I've heard mixed things on it anyway.
1079040	1083480	I've heard it's not so hot like that's that's the general reaction I've been seeing on Facebook.
1083480	1089620	And I actually resisted buying Final Fantasy 14 which has been getting some really mixed
1089620	1090620	reviews online.
1090620	1091620	Have you seen this?
1091620	1096560	Like some websites like I think GameSpot gave it a four like.
1096560	1098160	But some websites have been giving it like eights.
1098160	1101080	So it's it's really hit and miss Final Fantasy 14.
1101080	1102540	It's interesting.
1102540	1106960	So I will talk a little bit briefly then some of the games I was able to play since I was
1106960	1110400	like you know at the airport and stuff I did play a quite a few iPhone games.
1110400	1113040	So just really quick I know not everyone's into this but I'll mention a couple things
1113040	1114680	I played that came out.
1114680	1116580	Stardunk is totally free.
1116580	1119840	It's this basketball kind of game but not really like I don't want you to think it's
1119840	1122800	like a NBA type game because it's not.
1122800	1127400	It's like it reminds me a little more of those like old school tank shooting games because
1127400	1132320	you like kind of use your finger to pick like an angle and a power and then you just try
1132320	1135600	to fire a ball in the basket as many times as you can but the ball keeps moving around
1135600	1136600	the screen.
1136600	1139260	And it's like online and all this uber stuff with it.
1139260	1140260	So it's pretty cool.
1140260	1141920	BitTrip Beat came out on the iPhone.
1141920	1144800	This game will set you back five bucks.
1144800	1148480	That's a little much I think considering there are so many games out there that are 99 cents
1148480	1149480	and free.
1149480	1150480	I talked about this last week because I actually played it last week.
1150480	1151480	Oh did you?
1151480	1152480	What did you think?
1152480	1153480	I dislike.
1153480	1157440	I never really cared for the Wii controls you know how you had to tilt the remote to
1157440	1161200	get you know the stuff to go back and your little paddle to go back and forth.
1161200	1164600	And I really don't like it on the iPod or iPhone.
1164600	1170060	I'd rather use my finger to move it up and down and because that would be a lot more
1170060	1173680	accurate but it you can't and it's annoying.
1173680	1175640	It was I mean the tilt thing was fine for me.
1175640	1176840	I enjoyed it.
1176840	1181240	I still think it's a good game and it's weird that like I'll pay ten dollars on it for the
1181240	1184560	on the Wii but then I sit here and go but five dollars on the iPhone is too much.
1184560	1188040	But I think we just get accustomed to these different pricing things when there's so many
1188040	1191840	games out on the iPhone that are free or like three dollars or less.
1191840	1197480	Like your game has to be really good to justify a five dollar or even like ten dollar premium.
1197480	1200600	It's Sonic 4 they want like $9.99 for that right?
1200600	1201600	Okay.
1201600	1202920	No I am not paying that much.
1202920	1205360	But would you pay fifteen for it on the PS3?
1205360	1206360	No I wouldn't.
1206360	1207560	Oh okay.
1207560	1209440	I wouldn't.
1209440	1210700	And why is that Loki?
1210700	1211700	Why is that?
1211700	1212700	Why is that?
1212700	1214240	Because I've played it and it's terrible.
1214240	1215240	Really?
1215240	1216240	Yeah.
1216240	1217240	I didn't trade it at E3 enough.
1217240	1218240	It was fine.
1218240	1219240	But here's the thing though.
1219240	1224040	I'm not a real big fan of Sonic games so I you know maybe that's not for me to judge.
1224040	1229760	Personally I think like games like Sonic Colors or the good parts of Sonic Unleashed actually
1229760	1232480	seem more interesting to me.
1232480	1237040	It's just I don't know it he moves too fast for a platforming game.
1237040	1238980	That's my opinion.
1238980	1242800	But they're taken out like it's kind of funny because the version I have is like a beta
1242800	1245960	and so some of the levels that were in there like remember that mine cart level or whatever
1245960	1249120	that's not actually going to appear in the 360 version anymore.
1249120	1254840	It's only in the iPhone, iPod versions because they have tilt controls or in the Wii version
1254840	1256120	I guess.
1256120	1257200	Weird.
1257200	1260440	And I know we'll get into stuff later I'm not sure if the story.
1260440	1262880	Yeah there's some Sonic 4 stuff on the show later but.
1262880	1264760	And that that's ridiculous.
1264760	1265760	I'm sorry.
1265760	1268680	We'll get there when we get there sorry I just I do think it's interesting though that
1268680	1272440	it came out on the iPhone first like I'm sure you guys have heard Sonic 4 is out on the
1272440	1275360	iPhone now and it's not out on consoles till this week right?
1275360	1280880	I'll probably buy it on consoles anyway just because I'm a consumer whore yay you know
1280880	1281880	and how exactly.
1281880	1283600	Well if you like the old school Sonic games.
1283600	1284600	I love the old school Sonic.
1284600	1285600	Then you'll probably like it.
1285600	1286600	I will.
1286600	1290240	I didn't care for the old I like Sonic 1 that was alright and Sonic and Knuckles was kind
1290240	1294940	of fun but I don't know I just don't like Sonic too much.
1294940	1298960	The Dreamcast one recently came out on the 360 as well and I did play that a little bit
1298960	1299960	a couple weeks ago.
1299960	1300960	And apparently that was a terrible port as well.
1300960	1301960	It was okay.
1301960	1304520	Well actually I know I took that back it wasn't a terrible.
1304520	1306720	It isn't the same game to me at all.
1306720	1308840	It's just not the same game to me at all.
1308840	1311880	Well like people are complaining about like graphics and stuff in there I'm like it's
1311880	1315520	a Dreamcast game when you expect I mean come on.
1315520	1321600	Because you're taking a game that you remember from your tiny TV in your bedroom that was
1321600	1327720	hooked up with the RCA red yellow white cables or maybe even like the RF adapters like you
1327720	1331440	know minimal graphical ability for this day and age and now you're putting it on your
1331440	1332720	HDTV.
1332720	1337120	Well every flaw you're going to see now and every rough polygon that was smooth before
1337120	1339760	because the old TVs weren't as crisp.
1339760	1344520	And your expectations back then were way lower I mean remember when the Nintendo 64 stuff
1344520	1352800	came out and hell even before that you know just even some of the I don't know like 3D
1352800	1357760	stuff on even like the mode 7 stuff sometimes like even Mario Kart and stuff it's like oh
1357760	1359360	my god this is so awesome.
1359360	1363600	You know that's why some people can't get into the retro gaming like you know and I'm
1363600	1369040	like oh Game Room is awesome because like Atari 2600 games on your HDTV like you can't
1369040	1374000	hook up an Atari 2600 to your HDTV anymore without some major rigging going on that's
1374000	1375800	going to cause loss of quality.
1375800	1381100	But like you know these Atari 2600 games are crisp on my HDTV.
1381100	1385120	Yes I know that's kind of weird because it's not like 2600 games were known for their graphics
1385120	1386600	but it's kind of neat.
1386600	1391440	You know I don't know and in fact not everybody gets that and that's okay that's why.
1391440	1396180	You heard you heard what they're doing with what Capcom is planning on doing with the
1396180	1400640	iPhone stuff they're planning on doing something like Game Room but with the Capcom games.
1400640	1401720	Oh interesting.
1401720	1404120	As long as Quiz and Dragons is in there I'm game.
1404120	1405120	Probably.
1405120	1406120	Quiz and Dragons was awesome.
1406120	1410120	It was it ran on the same hardware as it was either CPS 1 or 2 I can't remember what's
1410120	1411600	the one that Street Fighter 2 is on?
1411600	1414480	Street Fighter 2 is CPS 2.
1414480	1418160	All the okay Quiz and Dragons was on this it was Magic Sword Final Fight they were all
1418160	1419160	on that same engine.
1419160	1420160	Yeah.
1420160	1421160	Quiz and Dragons was awesome.
1421160	1422160	Just saying look it up.
1422160	1425840	All right anyhow I think I need to bribe Dark Soccer to make that a classic game of the
1425840	1426840	week at some point.
1426840	1427840	Which one?
1427840	1428840	Just saying Quiz and Dragons.
1428840	1429840	You know I never played it.
1429840	1430840	Really?
1430840	1431840	Yeah.
1431840	1432840	It's neat.
1432840	1436080	It's in one of those Capcom collections it's it's hard now because all the trivia questions
1436080	1437560	are like from 92.
1437560	1443920	They're like who is president now it's like oh no I think it was Clinton was it all right

1538360	1543480	creative in it and it's one of those games that never really ends all right chat that
1543480	1547600	orange is ready to calm lots of comments Tiger Claw says and many of the Atari 2600 games
1547600	1552240	are two-player online and no ability to play with others online with it I agree game room
1552240	1557060	has huge flaws and that's why it's not doing as well as you think it would and that's one
1557060	1562640	of them and it's very very sad because now nobody's gonna attempt it again this generation
1562640	1566920	and that makes me very sad that they had such a great idea and then kind of made these few
1566920	1572480	key decisions that just kind of ruin it boo hiss let's see salacious pop says minecraft

1708720	1713720	our facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio blah blah blah etc etc let's get into
1713720	1716840	some actual gaming news we're only what 30 minutes into the show need some gaming news
1716840	1721880	just just a little bit loki what's up in the world of gaming well uh lots of stuff in fact
1721880	1727840	there's a new um I guess you would call it a handheld console that's coming from somebody
1727840	1734280	that used to be in the console business and is not anymore panasonic um they you may remember
1734280	1740440	them for the 3do then again maybe you don't remember them for the 3do because it wasn't
1740440	1746160	that great um well now they have a was that the system with the terrible like zelda and
1746160	1750680	mario knockoff games was that the 3do or cdi I always get those two mixed up because they
1750680	1755960	were 3do they were right around the same time yo had like some of the old 3do had mega race
1755960	1761600	right did it um it may have had mega race it had I remember I played um you don't know
1761600	1769000	jack on the 3do and I also played um road rash on 3do road rash is cool maybe road rash
1769000	1773640	is what I was thinking of not mega race um he may have had mega races all around that
1773640	1778520	same time period anyways so they're putting out this new handheld console that's called
1778520	1785320	the jungle and it apparently has a full uh qwerty keyboard a high res display plus a
1785320	1793280	touch sensitive d-pad and buttons and um apparently they're gonna be they're like they said they're
1793280	1800160	gearing it for um mmos the thing runs linux um so it's obviously gonna be able to run
1800160	1808900	other things but honestly I don't know many mmos that run natively in linux so it's nice
1808900	1816960	that you made a console for mmos that don't yet really exist for the console well but
1816960	1821560	they get a lot of stuff to run on linux does wow run on linux I don't think it does I think
1821560	1826440	it's just pc and mac like I know blizzard people have gotten to run in the uh gnome
1826440	1832280	I mean at the gnome the whatever the virtual environment is wine interesting um it also
1832280	1839400	comes with a mini hdmi port a mini usb port um headphone jack of course um is kind of
1839400	1845000	thick looking um people say it looks kind of like the n gauge I don't know if I'd compare
1845000	1854480	to the n gauge um and funny enough they uh unveiled it on the mtv show to which this
1854480	1864080	at this point I was unaware of uh rob looks like rob uh deer decks fantasy factory yeah
1864080	1869820	I don't know anything about that show wow yeah huh it's a long way from downtown julie
1869820	1875160	brown that's all says um I guess along with the system Panasonic is launching a Battlestar
1875160	1881800	Galactica title for the device and a web show called online underground I wonder if it's
1881800	1886360	that same Battlestar Galactica mmo I saw at e3 because that looked kind of neat I don't
1886360	1894640	know um it looks neat I mean if it actually supported you know mmo's or something you
1894640	1897480	need to the point where it would be able to run them without any sort of lag or something
1897480	1901540	that might not be bad um I could see this almost as something that you could say for
1901540	1907120	example stream something kind of like the on live stuff maybe you know have this portable
1907120	1911160	device with you it connects to the web and you can stream say something from your pc
1911160	1915000	so you can play an mmo on it or something I bet you know with all this on live stuff
1915000	1918240	I bet we're only a couple of years away from seeing something just like that if this isn't
1918240	1921780	it that's a really good thought is that you know pretty soon these handheld devices will
1921780	1927000	be able to stream heck the psp actually will stream from your ps3 but not in the way you
1927000	1932240	think like you can't play games over it or anything but you know you can like get files
1932240	1938360	can you well you can do like the ps1 game no ps3 games no I tried it before you can't
1938360	1942680	do yes you can that must be doing something wrong you are doing something wrong you play
1942680	1947800	ps3 games really yes huh I've been I've been doing something wrong this whole time now
1947800	1953080	granted it's certain ps3 games you can play that are compatible but that's why it's only
1953080	1958400	a certain one now certain psp games or ps3 games they have built in where you can stream
1958400	1965200	that and you can actually play it um however also with the recent hacks to the ps3 they
1965200	1970960	have enabled that on all games but the thing is it really comes down to um it comes down
1970960	1977320	to the control set whether the control set will work with what's limited on the psp but
1977320	1983120	yeah anything is possible um with the ps3 you can you know play any of the psp game
1983120	1988640	or ps3 games on the psp hmm and I bet most people don't even know that type of functionality
1988640	1995120	exists because sony would rather market these other features that you know yeah but um they
1995120	1998680	I don't I don't know when I when I hear of this thing and I see this thing and and you
1998680	2003120	describing it I don't think of this as like a handheld gaming device in a way I can pretty
2003120	2008720	large well I file this under the ipad competitor department doesn't this I mean to me yeah
2008720	2012880	it doesn't have a touch screen or anything but it seems more ipad esque where it's more
2012880	2018880	of like a computer that runs linux because if it runs linux then who's to say I can just
2018880	2024160	run mmos on it I mean couldn't I do spreadsheets on it it's possible right so it's more of
2024160	2028400	a computer than a gaming device I guess it's all in the way they're marketing it maybe
2028400	2035600	but it just seems strange to me Sony try to play off the ps3 as a computer yeah but I
2035600	2039880	don't know that was different because it's not like well I get but you could run linux
2039880	2045760	on the ps3 at least for a limited time it can't anymore but I don't think I don't know
2045760	2049880	how many people really use that feature I mean when they took it out certainly there
2049880	2055720	was that core group of hackers and folks that were very upset and then what the the military
2055720	2060200	had been using it or something is the the processors and those things are disgustingly
2060200	2066560	fast so it's kind of like a really cheap supercomputer but you know most people didn't get a ps3
2066560	2074040	to run linux on it most people did most people got it to be a cheap blu-ray player I see
2074040	2080680	it anyway yeah no all right well speaking of mmos whether this one will run on this
2080680	2085480	device or not I don't know but the biggest one world of warcraft at least here in the
2085480	2091200	US has a release date for its next expansion that's right the cataclysm will be starting
2091200	2096640	on December 7th that's where world of warcraft cataclysm will hit stores it's going to be
2096640	2101860	$40 when it comes out there will be a collector's edition for $80 that comes with an art book
2101860	2107760	commentary dvd soundtrack cd mouse pad trading cards and a little in-game pet called lil
2107760	2112840	deathwing so you can go out and run that and run out and buy that in stores or and I find
2112840	2117460	this very interesting we all kind of saw this coming after starcraft 2 they will be doing
2117460	2123860	digital download with this that strikes me as kind of amazing because they're not going
2123860	2129400	to have those awesome media opportunities of folks lining out lining up outside of stores
2129400	2134280	and all that unless I guess they're just getting the collector's edition but people are surprised
2134280	2140000	people are like pissed off that those collector's editions are really rare right now it's kind
2140000	2146520	of like I guess any of the other expansions it's just interesting to me that you know
2146520	2150560	they're going to go ahead and go the digital distribution route and kind of I don't know
2150560	2154360	it seems a little bit controversial but blizzard in the pc market can also kind of get away
2154360	2157680	with doing whatever it wants right now so well they don't want their sales limited by
2157680	2161240	the number of physical copies that are out there maybe they feel they can't put them
2161240	2164320	out fast enough I don't know maybe because you're gonna have a lot of people who want
2164320	2167880	this day one I mean most of the sales will be in the first couple weeks there's not gonna
2167880	2170920	be a lot of people that are gonna wait till Christmas that's why and by the way I just
2170920	2174600	just want to remind you kindly I told you this game was going to come out mid-december
2174600	2179040	like three months ago because blizzard can do whatever they want with actually blizzard
2179040	2185080	told us that it was coming out mid-december like in february and then they what moved
2185080	2188940	it around a bunch no no no they hinted at it you said on the show it's gonna be in november
2188940	2193080	like a couple that's what I'm saying that they said and that's compared to what they've
2193080	2198240	released in the past but apparently no it was they were saying there was some comment
2198240	2202520	that they made it was either an interview or something where they're like yeah there
2202520	2208480	was a 12.7 percent chance of blah blah blah blah blah and you know it was kind of a little
2208480	2213400	hint that they threw out that no one caught until just now like I'm saying they could
2213400	2218240	put this game out on christmas eve and people would still be lining up to get it I mean
2218240	2223640	it just doesn't matter it's it's that kind of game same thing with diablo 3 if they want
2223640	2230280	to release diablo 3 on thanksgiving they could do it uh let's see uh looking at comments
2230280	2234480	from chat dot orange entre.com toy gak in our chat room says I hate digital distribution
2234480	2240880	hard media forever maybe physical media I don't know I would you I know neither of you
2240880	2244960	really play well but let's say this was an expansion to a game you do really like let's
2244960	2250400	say dark soccer was a star trek online second edition or something and I don't know for
2250400	2256720	loki grand theft auto 5 would you bypass the store completely in favor of digital distribution
2256720	2262240	no and why not is that just because of what you do for a living uh what I do for a living
2262240	2269100	and what I do for a hobby okay dark soccer well keep keep in mind I actually did get
2269100	2275960	both digital and a you're cutting out I got both a digital and the physical copy so that
2275960	2281740	I could get special content although I have been known in the past to go the digital route
2281740	2286760	to get it slightly early all right all right and buy a physical copy later on convenience
2286760	2292040	like when I couldn't find all my wow stuff I downloaded it when I would try to play again
2292040	2296960	uh boshka in our chat room says collector's edition is barely worth it 40 for a pet no
2296960	2301920	thanks a lot of collector's editions have a cd and a book and all that I mean but yeah
2301920	2306160	a lot of collector's editions nowadays to me it seems like they're not worth it anymore
2306160	2310720	like I used to buy like collector's editions for different things like bioshock and saint's
2310720	2317600	row 2 and grand theft auto 4 and stuff like that it's just a bunch of crap that they throw
2317600	2323400	in there I mean I don't need any key I don't need keychains and like metal cases and shit
2323400	2329640	for my stuff anymore now a cool statue maybe but um you know a lot of times it's not really
2329640	2333720	worth it although the little big planet 2 collector's edition looks pretty fucking awesome
2333720	2339240	um tron not so much frisbee in our chat says but does it come with a plate and a spoon
2339240	2344160	kind of in a reference to that dreamcast game the dark soccer has uh defective candy in
2344160	2348820	our term says my biggest issue with digital distro is if something happens to my computer
2348820	2352120	if I can re-download it I would do digital you know that's something that blizzard's
2352120	2356360	pretty good about though I mean even if you have these games from way before there was
2356360	2360720	ever digital distribution like for instance I see dan up there in his collection has a
2360720	2365380	warcraft 3 game and there's a serial number on that if he goes to battle.net and enters
2365380	2369500	in that serial number it'll get attached to his account and he could always re-download
2369500	2373080	warcraft 3 wherever he's at so it's kind of you know that is one thing blizzard's pretty
2373080	2376120	good about is that once you do have the game tied to your account you could always re-download
2376120	2383680	it anywhere kind of interesting so anyhow one other uh quick note here on world of warcraft
2383680	2389100	it was also announced by blizzard this week that they have surpassed the 12 million subscriber
2389100	2393600	mark that's right there are now 12 million subscribers for world of warcraft keep in
2393600	2397960	mind that's not just in the us this is uh partially attributed to the fact that wrath
2397960	2402840	of the lich king finally came out in mainland china just about a month ago and of course
2402840	2409080	cataclysm is coming out here soon so everybody's getting ready for that so who knows um yeah
2409080	2413240	this is interesting though the last time there was a big population increase announcement
2413240	2418820	was december 2008 when it got to 11 and a half million so a lot of folks at that time
2418820	2423240	thought oh wow it's topped off it's dying but nope they got up to 12 million this week
2423240	2427720	but probably not likely to ever get as high as 20 million as some people thought it once
2427720	2433960	would there's 20 million people living in australia just so you know come on australia
2433960	2441040	would what's the holdup there you go so uh yeah world of warcraft 12 million people that's
2441040	2445160	a lot of people playing but that is a worldwide number not just here in the us otherwise that
2445160	2449600	would be quite astounding uh i think there are still bigger games in china though i do
2449600	2453960	not think wow is the biggest game in china by far i believe lineage is still the dominating
2453960	2460640	game over there so weird yeah dark sakura what do you got for us some more stuff oh
2460640	2465080	i love stuff how about dc universe yay i'm really looking forward to dc universe online
2465080	2474920	well um you gotta wait no it's been delayed until spring 2010 no wait spring 2010 then
2474920	2486680	it's already out 11 no which means that uh it's gonna be a while however um the beta
2486680	2495520	is gonna be available in november that will be um if you pre-order the game then you are
2495520	2501840	uh guaranteed access to the november 30th beta so you have to have it you have to pre-order
2501840	2507280	before november 15th to make it into the beta so you can still get the game in november
2507280	2517000	you just have to pre-order the game to play the test game yes okay because i'm doing their
2517000	2522640	job right of course not i'm still very excited about dc universe online i'm sad to hear it's
2522640	2527480	getting delayed but at the same time there was another big mmo that came out very recently
2527480	2532720	that i said should probably be delayed until 2011 uh boy did they listen boy yeah boy did
2532720	2536280	they listen uh so you know what if that's what this game has to do to take the time
2536280	2542040	to get it right then you know what so be it if it's that much better they can always just
2542040	2548600	patch it later on that's right that's right it doesn't need to be finished patching finish
2548600	2553580	it's never finished it's an mmo we're always adding stuff i mean fixing things i mean making
2553580	2559640	it not shitty i mean tiger claw sharing a new sound effect for us uh i guess this is
2559640	2565160	the the sister to sad trombone to play when we have depressing stories like uh dc universe
2565160	2574160	online is delayed until spring 2011 oh that's not a new one this is called sad tuba.com
2574160	2580560	i just thought sad tuba that's just the price is right losing horn the price is light is
2580560	2584120	i thought it was going to be the sad trombone thing played on the tuba so i thought it would
2584120	2592520	be whatever that's the craziest dorkiest thing i've ever heard yeah i know i know anyhow
2592520	2598960	yeah let's move on quickly before i embarrass myself again yes so um this is kind of neat
2598960	2605800	on live apparently is ditching the monthly charge and they're going free um and apparently
2605800	2609880	they're also working on well they they talked about this they're working on a mini kind
2609880	2614880	of streaming console that's supposed to be manufactured soon apparently um the former
2614880	2621640	night 14.95 per month service i guess which was um through its founding members program
2621640	2630860	uh they have offered now a year of free service and apparently uh they're also going to be
2630860	2635160	offering a bunch of free demos and stuff to check out uh you can i think that the free
2635160	2641880	service is not free forever i think it's just um you know like a trial type thing and um
2641880	2647240	you can basically create an account with uh no monthly cost no credit card needed for
2647240	2653000	sign up and uh lots of free stuff to play and then the micro console it's gonna be like
2653000	2658160	a kind of a streaming box think of like a sling box or something like that with a controller
2658160	2664280	built in and you basically plug it into a tv i guess almost looks like maybe like a
2664280	2668960	was an apple tv or something like that yeah they were showing those at e3 it looked kind
2668960	2673320	of interesting the whole like plug into the tv stuff yeah i was like is this there's a
2673320	2676800	trick to this there's a computer in the box or something there's a trick i mean it's not
2676800	2681400	it's worked so far i mean they the apparently the stuff they've been showing is very low
2681400	2686200	latency so um apparently they got it to work over wi-fi now too like i remember one of
2686200	2691000	the big drawbacks originally was that it wouldn't work over wi-fi but now it does let's go figure
2691000	2696240	um well i mean that was certainly a drawback to online was this whole monthly fee like
2696240	2701600	really you're gonna like pay me a monthly fee to buy games seems a little strange it's
2701600	2705720	like you're having to join i'd like someone to pay me a monthly fee to buy games no i
2705720	2711080	thought that the monthly fee was just like to play whatever on their service kind of
2711080	2716160	no no no you still have to rent the games or buy the games and even when you buy them
2716160	2719540	it's only guaranteed for three years because you know you're playing on someone else's
2719540	2724440	computer so if the service ever gets shut down in three years or whatever then it's
2724440	2730200	it's gone so it's still a little bit iffy but if you're the type that just wants to
2730200	2736640	rent games or check out the game demos which certainly is useful um then it might be worth
2736640	2741760	it i still need to sign up and check it out i would like to make you use of the uh game
2741760	2746140	rental i think it might be kind of yeah the whole uh free demo thing might be kind of
2746140	2751140	cool because say for example you know you want to play like one of the new games that's
2751140	2755680	coming out recently or very soon or something like that and they have a demo for it you
2755680	2760260	don't want to spend time downloading i mean because some of these demos out there are
2760260	2765020	you know a few gigs in the download that it might take a very long time and then you have
2765020	2769980	to install it and that takes more time this you can just play it and go oh don't like
2769980	2777220	it go to the next one the no need to download install you know worry about doing all that
2777220	2782960	stuff just kind of play it as you go yeah and plus you could have like a crappy computer
2782960	2787740	and it still plays and that would be kind of cool to do with like say like an xbox 360
2787740	2792380	or something like that so i don't have to download the demo i can just boom play the
2792380	2796560	demo instantly i bet that i bet that's going to be a big feature in the next generation
2796560	2803940	of consoles maybe i've said i said a while ago that this is the games analyst in me one
2803940	2807980	of them probably playstation is going to be ballsy enough to try and go all digital just
2807980	2811540	cut out the physical media completely look out game stop that works so well for them
2811540	2819260	in the past i think it'll be different because it'll be that the problem with the psp go
2819260	2823800	is that it was really more lucky more well because it was more money for the removal
2823800	2827900	of the future but if they had charged like ninety nine dollars for that thing it would
2827900	2836540	have done great that's the difference so with the psp2 being announced next year i'm sure
2836540	2843940	we'll see what's coming well we will one thing we know is coming very soon is nba jam and
2843940	2847760	apparently uh lots of interesting stuff going on with nba jam i don't know if this was covered
2847760	2851180	last week or if it was this week or what but nba jam i guess got ended up getting split
2851180	2857420	off from the nba game on the 360 and the ps3 right yeah so now it's coming out as a standalone
2857420	2862500	game so that's kind of interesting and one thing uh we wanted to see an nba jam uh would
2862500	2866620	be hidden characters because you know the old school nba jam was awesome because it
2866620	2871260	had what it had like uh scorpion and some of the mortal kombat characters and what i
2871260	2874820	think bill clinton was in there somewhere right oh yeah well uh apparently this new
2874820	2881420	nba jam is is keeping with the political ha ha's and uh you can actually unlock obama
2881420	2887420	and uh sarah palin as playable characters so yeah uh there are it's out on the we now
2887420	2891500	so you can check it out and there's actually some codes have already been found on how
2891500	2900240	to unlock um certain things i guess you can get some furries and everything wow yeah i'm
2900240	2902920	trying to look at some of the things you can unlock here yeah it looks like you can unlock
2902920	2909500	some of the mascots there oh yeah they have the mascots available in the old ones a furry
2909500	2915820	dream you can have bush and chaney on your team why if because you want them to play
2915820	2921460	basketball bush has mad hoop skills of course there you go so i'm trying to look up some
2921460	2927400	of these codes where are they ah there we go you can unlock the beastie boys as a team
2927400	2933540	yeah it sounds like wow there's actually a lot of hidden people in this that's kind of
2933540	2941680	cool manute bowl is hidden in there good times um i was gonna say i don't know if you heard
2941680	2948720	about how close nba elite was to being released i mean to the point where an actual retail
2948720	2954560	copy of it leaked out like a disc because i guess they sent them to retailers and then
2954560	2960180	the retailers had to send them back oh wow and apparently according to the person that
2960180	2965080	bought one of the retail copies off ebay um the game was really buggy and really fucking
2965080	2971700	terrible like just all sorts of glitches and bad stuff in there um and then of course they
2971700	2979620	had nba jam on the ps3 with that um and apparently that was they have i guess some of the features
2979620	2984180	that they're talking about adding in now we're actually going to be download content in there
2984180	2988100	so they're saying oh yeah it's not done yet we're adding remix mode or whatever to the
2988100	2994140	game well actually we're going to release it anyways you just um now you're not spending
2994140	2999380	extra money for it or something uh tiger cloth sent me a link in our chat room at chat.org.com
2999380	3003340	and i remember seeing this early this week and kind of like rolling my eyes it's one
3003340	3010540	of these stories about um uh when people who don't play games talk about games oh yeah
3010540	3016540	did you hear about this this is on fox news game on sarah palin facing off against president
3016540	3023260	obama in basketball not on some court in washington or wasilla it's the new nintendo we version
3023260	3027980	of the video game nba jam and i apologize this is quiet head-to-head competition shooting
3027980	3033960	hoops along with a host of high profile politicians peter moore is president anyway they go on
3033960	3038540	to wonder if uh they're gonna make a bipartisan game and all this i'm just like really come
3038540	3043860	on anyhow they're pissed off because obama had some sort of super move and the rest didn't
3043860	3051260	so that's unfair they're biasing you know well he's the president and the rest aren't
3051260	3058660	i mean it's really quite that simple right in theory right uh anyhow rob what how about
3058660	3063300	something a little different how about something a little different more about the we well
3063300	3069820	we just had a story on the way but this is about capcom oh okay um there's going to be
3069820	3075260	some more um downloads coming up for virtual console of course this is uh particularly
3075260	3085820	um for the uh uk release um there is going to be um ghouls sorry ghosts and goblins which
3085820	3093280	we love in this house and 1942 will be available also um black dragon which is a little obscure
3093280	3100860	um they're also going uh they said they don't have a date yet on them but they're going
3100860	3107200	to be 800 points apiece and also other uh ones that uh were recently announced were
3107200	3116160	commando sonson and xx so x texas xx where's quiz and dragons i've been i've been asking
3116160	3122540	since the top of the show where's my quiz and dragons is that on the list no alas no
3122540	3126100	rob it is not on the list i like though that a lot of those games you're mentioning are
3126100	3129500	kind of like the ones outside the box like they're not like all the mainstream arcade
3129500	3134300	games i mean maybe like ghosts and goblins commando awesome but like you know sun sun
3134300	3138780	like what's next hiji maru remember that one hija maru hija maru that's it the the one
3138780	3142340	that's on the pirate ship i don't even think it came out in the us but it's an ultra kade
3142340	3148700	that's the only way i ever played it pingo pingo was a sega game wasn't it sega i was
3148700	3154460	just thinking of more obscurity there you go i like this but the there's a little bit
3154460	3158100	of delay between when we talk and when the chat room gets it so the chat room is commenting
3158100	3164100	on the whole fox news thing chat.orangecountry.com this is a good joke uh hits they're talking
3164100	3167700	about how you know obama gets the special move the republicans have nothing hits done
3167700	3174780	goes but all the republicans have an eight and steal get it it's a political joke come
3174780	3179180	on come on come on no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on that's that's
3179180	3185260	kind of funny i want abraham lincoln to be in nba jam i think they should do an all presidential
3185260	3190860	one that'd be awesome and why leave it to just us presidents why not why not do some
3190860	3196940	royalty as well that's right get margaret thatcher and queen elizabeth lady gaga while
3196940	3200900	we're at it should definitely be on a team i'm really surprised so with nba jam being
3200900	3205180	the way that it is you know where it's just you know static headshots and stuff like that
3205180	3209180	they didn't have a way to put yourself in the game i mean because all it really is it's
3209180	3214900	just your you know it's just 2d headshots because that will be nba jam people will have
3214900	3221140	like middle fingers up for haters man well you don't have to you don't have to have that
3221140	3224260	available online you can have that where you can just you know if you want to play that
3224260	3229740	yourself like my me characters those you know we have what upside down head we have you
3229740	3235820	know vagina person you know it's just ridiculous stuff penis face you know that's on it you
3235820	3240540	know they're walking through the meat parade no it's great because we were playing uh not
3240540	3244180	necessarily i don't really know if i have the penis one anymore but we were playing
3244180	3251060	uh mario kart wii one day and there my boss was watching and he's like did i just see
3251060	3259220	hitler in the background like yeah nice you might have and chuck norris well uh we have
3259220	3261980	a list list coming up i don't think we're gonna end up doing it tonight i think we'll
3261980	3264780	roll it over to next week when we actually have a special guest here but we're actually
3264780	3270100	gonna do a list list on character i most want to see in nba jam so you can look forward
3270100	3273380	to that we'll probably end up doing that next week i think we're gonna table that to next
3273380	3276300	week because we didn't end up having a fourth person here tonight we are gonna have a guest
3276300	3279540	next week i'll talk more about that a little later on in the show because it's it's very
3279540	3283780	exciting for very exciting reasons it's gonna be retro-tastic next week and i'll tell you
3283780	3287940	why exciting guest is exciting a little later on in the show uh in the meantime let's go
3287940	3292060	and travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming soon to a store near
3292060	3299160	you loki he has lots of good stuff actually um because we're knee deep in releases this
3299160	3307500	week um starting off of course the big one medal of honor on playstation 3 xbox 360 and
3307500	3319180	pc um arcania arcania gothic 4 coming on xbox 360 super scribble knots now with adjectives
3319180	3326520	um coming out on nintendo ds this week um some slightly crappier games dealer no deal
3326520	3332540	special edition now with a plastic briefcase that you can hold your nintendo ds in that's
3332540	3338820	of course on the ds sled shred featuring the jamaican bobsled team wow that would have
3338820	3343900	been good like years ago um that's coming out wasn't john candy in the cool runnings
3343900	3348540	movie that was about the jamaican bob yeah that's how old that is that shows you how
3348540	3354700	old it was because he died what like 15 years ago god rest his soul he was an awesome comedian
3354700	3361620	but this is a terrible game and it's on the we um other fun stuff let's see disney sing
3361620	3372500	at party hits on the we and ps3 uh zuzu pets kung zu on nintendo ds and we uh or maybe

3377660	3383740	on nintendo ds um you know frisbee in our chair room that's a damn good question is
3383740	3387500	deal or no deal still on i don't think it is like the syndicated one got canned this
3387500	3391700	year didn't it i don't know you know what's coming back though because i read game show
3391700	3397180	blogs one versus i think dylan or deal is still on there because now they're doing the
3397180	3401540	stupid thing where it's like the actual contestants are opening the cases i couldn't afford to
3401540	3404080	pay the models anymore that was that that was the syndicated one i don't think that's
3404080	3406980	on the air anymore i think that went off the air to make room for the this year's batch
3406980	3411900	of you know judge shows and all that but no i will say one versus 100 is officially coming
3411900	3415980	back to game show network and it has a new host it's not going to be bob saget you're
3415980	3421780	ready for this look who's guess who's hosting one versus 100 now arsenio hall tested for
3421780	3426860	it but no they passed over arsenio hall for ready get your groaning noises right oh wait
3426860	3431320	let me get sad tuba ready hold on hold on i need a sad tuba ready for this let me think

3440300	3445380	not he's i think he does the lyrics show yeah but he's still terrible okay no uh hosting
3445380	3451580	one versus 100 on game show network with a top prize of 50 000 down from a million carrie

3462820	3466100	dancing with the star i'm telling you because you know it takes a real dancer to know how
3466100	3470900	to if you want to get one place bob saget you know who you need you need the pick what
3470900	3475820	tom berseron tom berseron yes exactly well he's busy hosting dancing with the stars there's
3475820	3480580	like the biggest show on tv now oh come on it doesn't take that long to host dancing
3480580	3484940	with the stars i mean come on he can fit it in his work day to go host that other show
3484940	3490780	i mean shit well that's like you know maybe four hours at the most it's crazy pants to
3490780	3494860	me though that the one versus 100 is like gone from xbox live so they can do this cheap
3494860	3498580	version on game show network with carrie and anaba you know what i mean no disrespect i'm
3498580	3502140	sure it'll be fine and it's gonna be you know for an original game show it'll be fine did
3502140	3506980	you know this is still sad totally random but it makes no sense because i i actually
3506980	3513580	saw this on um it was on the soup i think punked is coming back and they're having justin
3513580	3518980	bieber hosting it no that is a lie that has to be a lie i don't believe that that has
3518980	3526860	as much truth as the lapd buying all the jet packs that's how true that story is come on
3526860	3534140	no way justin bieber is too busy like he's making 15 year old girls panties wet all across

4130180	4135780	oh what the fuck was it is a spaceship you know yamato yamato yamato yeah they're doing
4135780	4139700	live action one of that looks awesome it was starblazers in the us yeah wake me when they
4139700	4144980	have a panty and stalking game okay that's all i'm saying that's something alan turned
4144980	4149180	me on to this week panty and stalking look it up on youtube it's epic music rob need
4149180	4153740	more cosplay do we need the music i'll get the music hold on i'll get the music can you
4153740	4157680	explain what panty and stalking is real quick while i get the music it's an anime by gynax
4157680	4164340	and the same guys that did powerpuff girls z which was the sort of more teenage version
4164340	4168060	of powerpuff girls they did in japan okay she needs to get to the good stuff okay chick
4168060	4172140	kicks off her panties and turns them into a gun okay it's about two angels kicked out
4172140	4190220	of heaven one for having too much sex it sounds very luminous like this could totally be in
4190220	4197140	luminous but the whole series isn't animated like this though yeah most of it looks like
4197140	4201420	the powerpuff girls but yeah it's just she's up on the stripper pole and then it's very
4201420	4204500	seductive like you think the camera is going to go up her vag the way things are looking
4204500	4209740	there but then she kicks off her panties and they turn into a gun and the other one pulls
4209740	4214420	off her stocking and it turns into a katana and they destroy the shit monster i'm not
4214420	4223620	making this up so they need to make a game out of this i've decided that's the regular
4223620	4233340	was there anything else to say about this she shoots the shit monster in the face i'm
4233340	4236740	just digging the soundtrack though because that totally reminds me of you like something
4236740	4241180	like imagine if they did like a newer space channel five don't make cute games of course
4241180	4245540	because that'd be awesome um you know with that type of music you know more of like the
4245540	4252140	you know luminous type stuff i dug the kind of the swing music for space channel five
4252140	4256300	i dig it too but like you know i want something a little cross between like uh res children
4256300	4261020	of eden with you know like space less of the psychedelic stuff but you know still that
4261020	4266140	kind of high energy type of game because i i don't know if a lot of people get into the
4266140	4271500	swing stuff although i you know i i totally dig the old soundtrack but i could see something
4271500	4276920	like that you know just really off the wall sadly i don't think it'll have that same theme
4276920	4285140	just you know oh yeah it's a little inappropriate for inappropriate as rude americans that don't
4285140	4289620	understand the finer things in life it really isn't that far away from bayonetta i'm just
4289620	4294160	saying it's not like that no that's a game i need to go back and finish honestly when
4294160	4297180	alan first explained that to me i was like is this a sequel to bayonetta like what is
4297180	4304940	this bayonetta is so awesome all right uh dark soccer uk releases sorry uk releases
4304940	4310180	take us all right the release dates take us like an hour on this show uh can i speak now
4310180	4317780	please yes you can um for the uk on the 12th we have arcadia gothic four and everquest
4317780	4327860	house of fool fool okay um also lego universe um pinball fx2 on the 13th is son of the hedgehog
4327860	4335700	4 episode 1 and the 15th is alan wake the rider and medal of honor are also naruto shippuden
4335700	4345040	um ultimate ninja storm 2 that's it and that's what i have to say about naruto games of which
4345040	4351580	there are always plenty all right it wins a poopy all right uh loki what do you got
4351580	4356100	for us and giving ultimate ninja 2 is actually really awesome um i don't know if you've seen
4356100	4362580	it looks like a interactive anime i've played a bunch of the earlier naruto games yeah they
4362580	4365980	were they're fun games there's just too many of them but this is nothing like the early
4365980	4371140	naruto games this is like the one that came out on ps3 last year um that was just it looks
4371140	4375860	gorgeous i mean i'm not even in the naruto at all but i mean i almost thought about picking
4375860	4381500	up the game just because it looks so amazing um but yeah this new one's gonna be really
4381500	4386500	awesome especially if you're not a fan uh okay so other stuff that's not naruto related
4386500	4393520	of course um this is kind of odd to be hearing a first party company say but apparently nintendo
4393520	4398780	is saying hey you know what you can't blame piracy for uh poor game sales or at least
4398780	4405180	they're saying you can't blame piracy completely for poor game sales um they say i don't think
4405180	4411820	um we should attribute bad software sales solely to piracy um they're talking a little
4411820	4416780	bit about you know this was i guess during a q and a session i guess last week during
4416780	4420220	when they were talking about the 3ds pricing and stuff like that it's true there is always
4420220	4425900	an influence of piracy but it's important for us to increase the number of our consumers
4425900	4430120	who are willing to shell out their money to purchase our products so we do not intend
4430120	4434580	to think that slower sales are solely due to piracy and i kind of agree with them because
4434580	4441300	a lot of people out there you know people that pirate games aren't necessarily people
4441300	4447580	that buy games so if you lose a sale to someone pirating a game doesn't mean you're actually
4447580	4453120	going to lose a sale you know a physical copy sale because they were never going to purchase
4453120	4457260	a copy of the game in the first place dark toa gak in our chat room is saying nintendo
4457260	4463700	saying that bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit um but it was the wata that
4463700	4468940	said that so what it was a magazine interview i'm sorry it wasn't a magazine interview it
4468940	4473060	was during i guess a live interview during their nintendo conference thing when they're
4473060	4480300	uh talking about like the 3ds pricing and stuff like that oh right okay so um well i
4480300	4484020	mean you're you're kind of right in that regard that i think the people who pirate games aren't
4484020	4487300	usually the ones who are going to run to the store and buy them anyway the thing i do like
4487300	4492060	i i do kind of see as a problem not that it excuses them no it doesn't excuse them but
4492060	4496420	i think you know for example like on the wii and stuff a lot of the games that are more
4496420	4502180	niche or adult and stuff don't seem to do as well as say some of the games that most
4502180	4507580	people would be like why is that selling so much it's just a shitty ass party game but
4507580	4513940	people buy that stuff just like just dance a game that when it first came out like this
4513940	4517500	is stupid and then it's just at the top of the charts and you play it and you're like
4517500	4521520	wow this is actually kind of fun i had people come up to me at work who knew i had a video
4521520	4524700	game addiction and asked me if i've ever played it because they had and they had so much fun
4524700	4529860	with it and i'm thinking like really it's weird it the thing about just dance though
4529860	4534260	and it's kind of funny is you know that michael jackson the experience it's pretty much the
4534260	4539500	same game but that has also karaoke in there as well if you want to otherwise it's just
4539500	4544520	dance michael jackson that's basically what that is but it's probably part of the agreement
4544520	4550080	with the michael jackson camp or whatever you call it that they can't put michael jackson's
4550080	4554180	name below the title of the game like like probably like when beatles rock band came
4554180	4557980	out there's no way they were gonna call that game rock band beatles it was always the beatles
4557980	4563040	rock band yeah you know what i mean uh the same thing well it's not just dancing either
4563040	4567820	so yeah that would make sense just singing and dancing oh fair enough oh plus actually
4567820	4573640	just dance doesn't exist on the connect and the move yet but these michael jackson games
4573640	4577460	coming out on all of them right yes it is coming out all of them i mean it's basically
4577460	4582200	going to be like what dance central is except dance central and what i like about dance
4582200	4587200	central a little bit more than say um just dance is dance central first off can read
4587200	4591880	your whole body it's not just reading the sensor so you know for example if you're if
4591880	4596720	you want to play just dance and kind of cheat at it you just do what they're doing with
4596720	4600640	the one you know with your one hand holding your remote your right hand you just do what
4600640	4605720	they're doing on the screen you don't have to really do the rest of it um but this actually
4605720	4610520	reads everything you're doing and also like you know just like you would do with actual
4610520	4615600	street dancing or something it actually breaks down everything so you can go okay this is
4615600	4620240	this step this is how you do this step you learn that and then you just chain them together
4620240	4626680	to create a routine that's how you would learn to do actual dance routines um so i think
4626680	4633040	that's kind of neat there but uh yeah i mean it it's games like that that kind of appeal
4633040	4636560	to the mass audience that seem to do well and then on the we are and on the wheel on
4636560	4641800	the ds poor sales i mean a lot of that can be attributed to the games themselves because
4641800	4648240	there's a lot of junk on the ds a lot of junk and um unfortunately a lot of good games out
4648240	4653880	there just kind of get ignored because of all the junk that's out there because you
4653880	4659600	know people you know mass consumers don't really know a lot about games um a lot of
4659600	4662960	times in fact i was in a game stop today killing time for my double bacon pizza to be done
4662960	4670080	and um other than the employees bugging me about wanting to buy something i'm like no
4670080	4674440	hey man did you want to pre-order your copy oh hey that's a cool t-shirt i love that game
4674440	4678960	i'm like yeah that's cool hey you look like a man on the mission um is there anything
4678960	4682560	i can help you find no i'm just looking around killing time for my pizza oh that's a good
4682560	4688800	idea yeah i thought so too yeah that's why i'm here because i thought sitting around
4688800	4693520	the pizza place sucks no but um there was a kid walking around he's like is far cry
4693520	4701040	predator a good game and it's just like well that came out a while ago and besides you're
4701040	4705720	like 10 you shouldn't be playing a mature rated game because your parents don't care
4705720	4709760	you know but when we were young oh god here we go when we were young and playing those
4709760	4713780	8-bit you know nintendo games there was a lot of crap that we liked that i bet a lot
4713780	4717320	of people kind of looked at went boy this this is not a good thing that a lot of the
4717320	4724200	focus though was about games being fun see now and and now i i get it that there there's
4724200	4730600	a lot of that stuff out there now that it's it i mean back in our day there was also educational
4730600	4734520	games and stuff like that too but we were smart enough to know okay that's an educational
4734520	4740240	game i'm not touching that shit you know unless it was oregon trail or number munchers hey
4740240	4745640	well that stuff was force fed onto us you know at an early age and you know we just
4745640	4750680	adapted to it but i'm saying like you know with there's a lot of educational product
4750680	4754440	out there on the ds there's a lot of crappy licensed games well there's a lot of crappy
4754440	4759360	licensed game even on the nyes although cool spot was awesome and yo annoyed wasn't that
4759360	4764300	bad so they could pull it off back then it's just now unfortunately it's all about the
4764300	4770820	license and not about the gameplay as you know they have the jelly belly puzzle game
4770820	4777040	and the still waiting for my kill bill video game that's all i'm saying never gonna happen
4777040	4781760	well maybe when they do the third movie which that's never gonna happen you never know you
4781760	4785720	never know all right right you know what and i'll come out right after the clerk's animated
4785720	4791560	movie all right moving on to a game that is coming out like it or not in loki's case i
4791560	4796120	like it though sonic the hedgehog 4 is coming out it is already out on the iphone but it
4796120	4801560	will be coming out on the playstation 3 the xbox 360 and the we now sega is putting out
4801560	4806920	some incentives that you should buy this game on more than one platform that's right if

4840480	4849920	be revealed whoo and if you get all four versions so meaning what $15 on the ps3 $15 on the
4849920	4855120	360 15 on the we and what another 10 on the iphone right so if you buy all four versions

4923800	4930600	on there way to go bob purchasing two copies of the game you're an idiot i wonder though
4930600	4936040	if the uh you know they say the special placement in one very cool spot for buying three versions
4936040	4940440	i wonder if that's like in the credits of sonic part two sonic four part two that's
4940440	4948320	probably what it is that's still dumb don't you want your name in a video game it should
4948320	4955560	reward you with episode two instead of just you know oh so like incentives so by who the
4955560	4960680	main character of episode two is gonna be oh are you gonna spoil it for all our listeners
4960680	4964240	um i don't even know what the character's name is because once again i i don't follow
4964240	4970200	sonic way it's a stupid sonic robot thing not metal sonic but it's the one with he has
4970200	4975920	a spiky nose that's my that's my wonderful description of the sonic character frisbee

4982600	4987200	a good idea i'm gonna start no i'm not gonna do that because that would require effort
4987200	4991840	i was gonna say someone should start a thread on that same form of people who put their
4991840	4996560	names in who haven't bought any copies of it uh defective candy in our chat room says
4996560	5000280	maybe you guys could say hey give me five bucks and we'll stick your name to the top
5000280	5006440	of the olr forums i i'd love to but i i don't know that just seems really wrong to me it's
5006440	5011560	just really wrong uh act deft in our chat says loki sky and jamie need to buy one each
5011560	5017400	and get olr mentioned though no i'm not buying a copy of that you can buy three and get olr
5017400	5024880	mentioned exactly i would like to submit a fake fake name like you know bonnie von fluffles
5024880	5028740	or something like that you know like submit fake names that would be funny to get this
5028740	5035760	community manager to say sassy pants fuzzy bottom exactly i love that idea and big shout
5035760	5044800	out to sassy pants fuzzy bottom good times let's take a look in gaming's history and
5044800	5050360	the way things used to be in a better time it's a classic game of the week it's the part
5050360	5056520	of our show where dark sakura goes into the vault and says hey i'm gonna find a game that
5056520	5061560	these kids should be playing dark sakura what is the classic game of the week for these
5061560	5071320	little brats who don't know better the classic game is final fantasy 5 yay yay i picked boss
5071320	5077400	music because i couldn't find anything else um yeah it's a game by square came out in
5077400	5084040	1992 um it was only out in japan for the longest time on the super famicom and um it's super
5084040	5094480	fun it's the uh stars a guy named farts who actually the longest time it was but which
5094480	5103480	i used to laugh um a meteor falls and he goes to check it out and then oh noes we need the
5103480	5110520	crystals we have to uh seal x death which is the coolest name for a bad guy in a series
5110520	5118480	ever x death would you be afraid i might be afraid of x death anyway the cool thing about
5118480	5126980	this game is the job system um you your experience point and you battle monsters and stuff like
5126980	5133760	any final fantasy game you can get a chocobo and you get a ship and an airship and you
5133760	5139200	do different stuff this is the second one that uses the act of time battle where time
5139200	5144360	will flow continuously for both players and enemies which was first and final fantasy
5144360	5151400	4 which was 2 when it came out over here um the job system though is a really cool thing
5151400	5158800	because um you can gain different special abilities and sort of mix up your jobs um
5158800	5165080	you get ability points so you increase the job levels for different characters and you
5165080	5172680	can also say uh so you have a knight who also has white magic levels well then you become
5172680	5178600	a paladin for an example um you this is also the game that introduced the blue mage the
5178600	5185840	time age and the mind so that's why we have them in other final fantasy games um it was
5185840	5193440	a really cool game it had lots of cool characters you have uh lenna barks faris kriel they're
5193440	5200320	really cool um also a reoccurring boss which is what this music is is gilgamesh always
5200320	5205960	gilgamesh lots of gilgamesh battles um so yeah it's a pretty cool game um if you haven't
5205960	5210480	played it yet for the longest time you can only play it you know if you either had the
5210480	5216640	cartridge or had a really good emulator free japanese or it was translated um so it's really
5216640	5226680	cool um it was also one of and your microphone failed at this game what you can hear me now
5226680	5233640	i can okay well as i was saying it's one of the ones that was uh directed by sakaguchi
5233640	5240480	sorry and this is his favorite final fantasy game um all the character designs logo everything
5240480	5248400	was done by um Amano Yoshitaka Amano who is my hero and um the battle graphics are done
5248400	5258400	by Nomura that's pretty cool and um there had great music it's it's final fantasy it
5258400	5264660	was done by Uematsu there's a two disc album that came out with all the tracks on it which
5264660	5270440	i've got somewhere and then it also had a bunch of uh remixes there was a piano collection
5270440	5278160	final fantasy 5 and the remixes including final fantasy 5 mambo de chocobo we have since
5278160	5286240	seen it elsewhere um it's come out um on the playstation in japan um there was a final
5286240	5289520	fantasy collection that came out over here that had final fantasy 4 and final fantasy
5289520	5297880	6 on it it had a full motion video opening very cool and then we had the final fan the
5297880	5309880	final fantasy anthology um also on the playstation and uh they uh that's why they uh cheat where
5309880	5324000	they change the name to uh art and gill instead of guido um there was a playstation 2 release
5324000	5335480	there was a gameboy advance release that had uh an extra level and a new boss and they
5335480	5344360	were uh designed by Amano and then there was final fantasy 5 advance and uh it was really
5344360	5349200	cool there was however an automated it was called final fantasy legend of the crystals
5349200	5356440	that was an oav that was done by studio madhouse and uh it was the sequel to final fantasy
5356440	5367080	5 so there you go all right your classic game of the week boys and girls final fantasy 5
5367080	5371200	the one that was just too cool for america for so many years but finally square came

5531320	5534480	played ddr which you know might not seem like a big deal to all of you because like you
5534480	5539060	know oh hey dancing arrow stomping game funny but um you know if it weren't for ddr this
5539060	5543360	show wouldn't exist i probably would not know jamie or matt if it weren't for ddr we probably
5543360	5546100	would have ran into each other in some nerd circle one way or another but it just would
5546100	5552880	not have happened the same way so um next week on the program to celebrate the 10-year
5552880	5558640	anniversary of me playing ddr we've actually invited a guest who was there that night because
5558640	5564280	it was her first time ever playing ddr she's going to be here next week on the show jessica
5564280	5567880	harper from understation live is going to be here in the house some of you guys know
5567880	5573520	her as iguana girl uh one of the admins of ddr freak for i believe a couple years so

5615520	5621840	as much ddr as i was back then yeah that would help at the time heck yeah i was at my skinniest
5621840	5624920	when i first started playing ddr i mean that was around the time i think that was the same
5624920	5630360	time i was like dating a vegan who loved to cook and so like the worst food you ever eat
5630360	5634680	dating dating a vegan who loves to cook like you i will eat anything a vegan puts in front
5634680	5640240	of me because you know the worst thing that's in it is a vegetable or soy like it's terrible
5640240	5645880	it's not going to be like surprise cow brains or surprise it's the uterus of a duck you
5645880	5649360	know or something like that you know what i mean hey dan's had a cow brain i never heard
5649360	5656280	you complaining when i stuffed cow brains in the uterus of a duck right okay but i'll
5656280	5660400	tell you what i was like super thin back then when i was playing ddr and dating a vegan
5660400	5666360	like man that was that was crazy now i just now i eat at waffle square and and play world
5666360	5672280	of warcraft so i've gained a significant amount and now i eat double bacon pizzas exactly
5672280	5678600	which is funny because now i'm mostly vegetarian i know you're the one that's actually lost
5678600	5682680	the weight since those days some so you guys need to stop being vegetarian because i have
5682680	5688180	to eat more meat to compensate okay well yeah i'm not vegetarian i'm just i'm whatever i
5688180	5695000	eat meat like once a month all right anyhow i mean you know like cow flesh all right we'll
5695000	5700960	talk more about all that and and that stuff in a future episode uh next week here any

5734800	5741040	it's different all right uh loki start us off with some rapid fire news please well
5741040	5746920	during release um our releases this week i mentioned that the gears or not gears of worth
5746920	5752600	that'd be funny um borderlands game of the year edition is going to be coming out and
5752600	5757280	um well what's kind of neat about it is they just announced that the game of the year edition
5757280	5761040	of borderlands and this pisses me off because i bought most of the download content on its
5761040	5765820	own um will be coming with not only all the download content for borderlands but early
5765820	5772800	access to duke nukem forever in other words the demo so even more incentive to spend 60
5772800	5778000	dollars on the game most of you already have exactly yeah god i want that demo but you
5778000	5784320	know what though me being me um that demo will leak out and i'll be able to download
5784320	5790000	it so i don't care aren't you special i am special i'm thinking about but i don't know
5790000	5793240	how much i'd like borderlands but i hear it's like a first person world of warcraft with
5793240	5799040	guns borderlands is fun it's it's like yeah it's it's a first person shooter but it's
5799040	5807360	kind of a little bit of an rpg and there's a lot of like you know i'm looting i guess
5807360	5812120	so if you like loot it's a little bit like diablo i guess i like the phase walker girl
5812120	5822080	she's pretty cool yes she is pretty awesome i played the uh the hunter with a mordecai
5822080	5828160	yeah yeah with his raven of death uh that was awesome the the berserker guy is pretty
5828160	5833040	cool too act definite our chairman says damn it i got borderlands on steam for ten dollars
5833040	5839680	u.s that's why they put it on sale right before all this these announcements and jessica's
5839680	5844840	linking more old pictures of me she uh uh linked this one of me dressed up as brad for
5844840	5848520	the rocky or picture show and uh ezam in our chat room i hope i said that right he's on

5886160	5891040	as well if you happen to skip the first game you're in luck especially if you're in europe

5894400	5899280	free copy of the original game as well which by the way they are selling the original game
5899280	5906220	uh by itself in case you you know want to build your own bundle over here um in the
5906220	5912440	u.s. uh for another 50 bucks which is kind of a rip off if you ask me i believe though
5912440	5917440	if you pre-order through toys r us which no one's really doing that anymore because toys
5917440	5922600	r us is almost out of business um that's my only opinion really what makes you say that
5922600	5926920	no because i don't shop there anymore well because therefore the chain is out of business
5926920	5931000	because you don't shop there anymore the amount of crap i buy yeah i thought it was supposed
5931000	5938640	to be a cheap place to get diapers there is no cheap place to get diapers um but i think
5938640	5942880	if you pre-ordered there you also get a free copy of the game so it might be something
5942880	5951400	to keep in mind and then last but not least um with the release of the new mario anniversary
5951400	5959480	edition which by the way is just mario all stars but on the we now waiting not with extra
5959480	5964200	mario games no no not with anything not port of the super nintendo straight ass port of
5964200	5967200	the nintendo and it's not even the one that comes with mario something that they could
5967200	5972560	have i don't know put on virtual console for like ten dollars well maybe that's what they'll
5972560	5975120	do here in the u.s. because we haven't heard anything about this coming to the u.s. right
5975120	5979800	oh it'll come to the u.s. i guarantee it they can charge fifty dollars for something that
5979800	5985760	was really worth ten yeah they'll bring it out over here um but seriously nintendo we've
5985760	5990360	gotten into this conversation about how nintendo doesn't really they they do make new stuff
5990360	5995480	now but a lot of the stuff that they put out like hey look new mario game it's not really
5995480	6001640	new it's just ports of old games anyways that's not why we're talking about this we're talking
6001640	6004940	about this because they have a garish red looking console that's going to be coming
6004940	6011000	out over there instead to commemorate you know the mario 25th anniversary edition i
6011000	6017080	guess you know it doesn't have any cool mario graphics or anything it's just red and that'll
6017080	6023240	be coming out over there for uh 20 000 yen dark tetsuya in our chat room says great now
6023240	6027760	you're making me feel awful because i want this so bad you are an awful person if you
6027760	6031960	want this so bad stop it didn't even change the color of the light in the front you change
6031960	6036720	that to like red or something you know it's a collector's thing i don't know it's stupid
6036720	6041840	i think it should have a mario graphic on it yeah they should put some of these silkscream
6041840	6052800	some fucking shit on there we want stickers pimp my wee all right so loki will not be
6052800	6058320	pre-ordering one of these no why would i want yeah let me import a console from japan even
6058320	6064080	though i have a we already that i don't play anything on and then you know oh it's in a
6064080	6068680	wonderful red color that i really don't like that's awesome totally gonna put down four
6068680	6076040	i want tons of them all right some quick stories from me for you guys gears of war 3 uh is
6076040	6079000	gonna of course have multiplayer just like the other ones did there's gonna be a beta
6079000	6083400	of the multiplayer uh and epic games actually revealed this at an event this week um at
6083400	6086840	their headquarters uh this is the first time though that a gears war game is getting a
6086840	6091200	public beta so that's kind of cool uh gears war 3 is going to be coming out in the fall
6091200	6097480	of 2011 so the beta will be out sometime in the spring maybe they haven't said exactly
6097480	6102120	when next year they've just said next year there will be a beta so you guys can completely
6102120	6105840	base your judgments of the game off of beta because it's what a lot of people do a little
6105840	6112220	big planet too also delayed until next year maybe not as late next year i think i'm hearing
6112220	6117800	it's just going to be january probably they are not going to um actually release it this
6117800	6123560	year in time for the holidays and the reason why they don't want launch day passes patches
6123560	6127360	patches as i say passes patches uh quote we could have shipped it and it would have been
6127360	6132680	fine and this is a quote from the head of media molecule alex avens however we realize
6132680	6136900	that with just a couple extra weeks we can make the game super amazing adding the super
6136900	6141560	onto the already amazing which is this today this is something that will live forever and
6141560	6145880	the delay people will forget about i kind of like that he says that because that's a
6145880	6149820	that's a point we've brought up on the show before people don't forget oftentimes that
6149820	6154240	these games were delayed if they were that good like for example uh mario brothers melee
6154240	6158920	super or super mario brothers super smash brothers melee or whatever the one on the
6158920	6163700	we i was delayed like five times and people kind of just forgot by the time the game actually
6163700	6170280	came out you know what though i'm saying this is a good thing this is a good deal if it
6170280	6175360	keeps the game in good quality just like some of these other delays we've been hearing about
6175360	6179080	it's very interesting though that always at the end of the year delay delay delay it's
6179080	6182360	great that they're putting it out and so that we don't have any day one patches because
6182360	6186080	you know those people that don't have their playstations connected to the playstation
6186080	6192440	network anymore because of usb devices that they're using with their playstation 3 and
6192440	6198920	one more for me uh this is about a new shen moo game that's right there is that's right
6198920	6206880	there is a new shen moo game coming out it's coming out in japan this year shen moo town
6206880	6214640	is coming out on yahoo japan it's a mobile based social network mobage town that's right
6214640	6220720	the new shen moo game is a mobile game it's the third shen moo game there you go but they're
6220720	6225680	not calling it shen moo 3 but it's very i i don't know i still say this is a good sign
6225680	6228900	though if they're wanting to keep this fresh in people's minds this might be a good sign
6228900	6235480	so don't get too frumpy dark sakura no frumping over there but sorry it's not the game you
6235480	6241000	were hoping i was going to mention here on the show sad tuba all right dark sakura what
6241000	6248760	you got for us stuff and things how about um mega man stuff there's going to be a comic
6248760	6255640	out it's being put out by archie comics and um they are saying it's going to be faithful
6255640	6261920	to continuity so hopefully then again they also did that sonic the hedgehog ones that
6261920	6267160	i didn't think was very good nor the knight's one wasn't good at all um but it is written
6267160	6274480	by um ian flinn who's currently writing sonic the hedgehog um yeah i don't really have high
6274480	6280680	hopes for it the art looks interesting i mean protoman looks really freaking cool but i
6280680	6289720	don't know it might be okay we'll see when it comes out and in other news um typing of
6289720	6298440	the dead this is going to be a new version yay um it's typing of the dead featuring mina
6298440	6306960	no shuko i would be help if i could pronounce this properly featuring mina no shoku katsu
6306960	6316000	doniki um which is pretty much the dreamcast version with new words um except these look
6316000	6327480	like they're it says that everyone's job hunting diary so it's uh a job hunting site in japan
6327480	6333600	that they've teamed up with interesting so it's like um if they were to make a game on
6333600	6341880	monsters these are mini games in job hunting modes so you can type in words like disability
6341880	6350480	income and stagnant air interesting huh it's like these people never get a job they're
6350480	6357360	just playing games all the time and last but not least is more marvel vs capcom 3 stuff
6357360	6364600	we have new characters we have sir arthur and nathan spencer um arthur being from uh

6497880	6505720	a twitter topics tweets time tweeters oh found it mental organism designed only for killing
6506280	6514280	twitter.com slash olr if you want that's you in a nutshell says loki all right going to our twitter
6514280	6519640	and looking at some of the topics um not a whole lot tonight but we will get through some of these
6519640	6528680	here um yeah see this first one here from pop on jar or as i like to read his name popo and jar
6528680	6534040	it's the popo pop on jar estimates us surely you've seen this the most useless game accessory
6534040	6537800	ever and it's it's the game boat i remembered seeing that on the twitter and i just love the
6537800	6543000	picture because it's like the dude he's on a boat but yeah looks looks completely useless about his
6543000	6549080	use useless is that inflatable cart that i still kind of want the one that's coming out this week
6549080	6558680	yes uh mnzba sends us a tweet nintendogs blamed for an actual dog attack how in the hell does
6558680	6565320	this work yes uh let's see uh according to the daily mail this is in the uk megan walker was
6565320	6570040	peacefully playing a copy of nintendogs at a friend's house when one of the in-game dogs
6570040	6575400	barked at her but the bark was an earshot of the friend's bull mastiff a breed of dog that weighs
6575400	6582120	about 130 pounds the sound spooked the dog so much that it bit walker's face severing a portion
6582120	6588440	of her upper lip how sad the girl's grandma told the daily mail i think this game should carry some
6588440	6593160	kind of warning people should be told not to play it when there are dogs in the room i blame the
6593160	6597240	game for what happened to make it will eat your face if they hadn't been playing it i don't think
6597240	6602840	the dog would have gone for it you know lady maybe you shouldn't keep 130 pound dog near a
6602840	6608440	nine-year-old call it a hunch just a thought or one that's prone to eating your dog better just
6608440	6612840	thinking if you have a face eating dog you might want to keep it away from your nine-year-old
6612840	6619320	right i think a bull mastiff is the largest breed of dog good god they're huge crazy lady
6621080	6625880	i was bit by a dog when i was five it's not fun you're afraid of dogs i am actually like i i'm
6625880	6630280	getting better i used to be afraid of like all dogs but now it's just big dogs like if i was
6630280	6634760	around 130 pound dog i'd be running the other way i'm not even gonna lie but now like i'm at the
6634760	6641880	point where like alan has talked me into getting a corgi some corgis are adorable and they're little
6641880	6647960	and they're cute and they waggle and that's adorable they're super cute but i'm mostly a
6647960	6653560	kitty person uh blue swim is tweeting us namco bandai will be releasing the first sailor moon
6653560	6659640	game on the nintendo ds by year's end in italy no other details yet it will be the first new
6659640	6663960	sailor moon game since the series was relaunched internationally early this year so you can get
6663960	6670680	your sailor moon on um let's see spazinator is saying i'm doing all i can to promote olr on
6670680	6674920	facebook xbox live and playstation network hopefully it'll get you more listeners you sir
6674920	6680200	get a gold star thank you that's all we ask is to help get the word out about olr but of course i
6680200	6684040	need to say this not that i'm saying spazinator is doing this but just remember guys don't spam
6684040	6689400	you don't have to spam people because that just makes us look bad just saying tassel hoff
6689400	6697560	sends us a tweet hey olr i like it when people spell hey h a y hey hey olr what was a scene
6697560	6703160	in a video game that made you shed a tear or cry because of the scene oh we were talking about this
6703160	6710200	on warcraft the other night on vent games that made you cry that they were so sad um i probably
6710200	6715320	cried like twice during lost odyssey and i didn't even beat the game uh but just the end of the
6715320	6721240	first disc especially was very very sad um and i remember um i remember getting a little verklempt
6721240	6725080	at final fantasy 4 at the ending of that too most final fantasy games actually get me a little bit
6725080	6730360	verklempt loki was there ever a game that made you cry no he's saying no well he's sucked into
6730360	6732840	some iphone game he doesn't want to talk to you guys right now he's playing iphone games
6733400	6738920	uh dark sakura game that made you a little a little bit verklempt i've cried out of frustration
6738920	6746280	okay what game made you cry out of frustration oh a couple at least a few puzzle games and playing a
6746840	6750280	x-men versus street fighter with dan because i'd get so pissed off at him that i'd cry
6753080	6760040	i can admit it nice all right uh moving on to some other tweets uh oh we've been getting this
6760040	6764840	from a couple people actually akki ripper says it's a tweet but jeweled is free at the moment
6764840	6770360	at popcap.com that's right that's only for about another what two hours so sadly which i i got it
6770360	6773560	too late for the podcast ease but if you're listening to this now you can get bejeweled 2
6773560	6780200	free i gotta be honest though i mean how many of you don't already own bejeweled 2 in one way or
6780200	6784920	another i didn't really you can play it online for free you always could i wasn't interested
6784920	6791640	but i like the iphone one no i had it on my old ass phone back in the day i have it on the iphone
6791640	6797320	phone phone and the xbox 360 so i appreciate that they're giving away a free game but it's it's a
6797320	6803160	10 year old game you guys no but hey free games are free games i just feel like i'm being a digital
6803160	6809880	hoarder if i download that all right spazinator psn says fyi in homes theater there's an episode
6809880	6814520	of inuyasha streaming for free oh that's kind of neat that they're using the theater to stream
6814520	6820040	free like quote unquote real things and not just the in-house sony stuff like the tester
6820040	6823800	or whatever that's kind of cool i think they should do more of that in sony home
6825560	6831720	act def says uh kirby's epic yarn was supposed to be a new ip for nintendo so originally i guess
6831720	6835560	this wasn't even going to be a kirby game that's kind of neat he's actually linking us to a story
6835560	6842200	here i guess awata made some comments on this um originally let's see and it was revealed that
6842200	6846920	kirby was not going to be in the game and the original character going by the name of fluff
6846920	6852440	could have been the main character with the game carrying the title world of yarn instead which is
6852440	6857480	funny given the other article that said that it was inspired by a kirby commercial that they did
6857480	6865400	in japan in the mid 90s interesting uh let's see tiger claw sends us a couple tweets and i don't
6865400	6868280	remember either of these being on our show world so i'll go ahead and mention about these stories
6868280	6873320	real quick again from tiger claw on twitter uh nintendo patent shows the we fidelity sensor game
6873320	6879960	example so i guess the uh patent leaked out and it kind of shows how this uh thing works let's see
6879960	6886440	the vitality sensor measures a player's relax fluid sounds kind of gross it's just one of the
6886440	6892600	examples of the game it's calculated by measuring the cardiac cycle over a hundred pulses similar
6892600	6898040	to brain age this number can be compared to relax fluid of same age persons it mentions a stretch
6898040	6902280	game where players tilt the remote up and down to move a character while you're moving flying
6902280	6908200	character players have to adjust their breathing to match the ceilings dips and drops interesting
6908760	6913240	the character automatically moves that the screen scrolls to the right when you inhale you fire
6913240	6918520	smiling blobs hat up towards the ceiling it drops when you exhale this game uses the vitality sensor
6918520	6924840	to identify inhales and exhales interesting but again i i don't see how this is gonna like they'll
6924840	6930360	make a wario aware game out of this and that's it you know what i mean there's always a warrior
6930360	6935320	aware game for the peripheral then it'll be done also and i remember reading about this too and
6935320	6940200	this is always sad to hear about layoffs but microsoft's in-game ad unit apparently is shutting
6940200	6945960	down this month and this is a report in an ad industry trade publication ad week citing sources
6945960	6951160	close to the company and insiders of microsoft stating that massive general manager j.j richards
6951160	6954760	is now seeking new employment and other unit members have been reassigned throughout the
6954760	6958360	company so i guess only one person got laid off so i guess that's good that they were able to be
6958360	6963320	redistributed um microsoft apparently had been shopping around a massive buyout in the past few
6963320	6968840	months uh what this all boils down to though i guess it's conflicts with the xbox live team
6968840	6974520	because the xbox live team sells the ads directly on the xbox dashboard and doesn't really want the
6974520	6983320	competition with the in-game ads so there it goes bye there you go that's our twits tweets twats
6983320	6989320	for tonight twitter.com thank you guys for your tweets we'll see you next week on the twitter in
6989320	6996600	the meantime i'm gonna have to go back and uh wake up loki from his iphone awake hi and climber
6996600	7002280	it's awesome is that like crazy climber no it's like uh if you cross bionic commando with a ninja
7002920	7011800	and it's all like climbing really fast it's cool and it's free free is awesome free is awesome so
7011800	7020600	this is kind of neat apparently uh at&t uh u-verse is going to be offering um ip tv i guess or
7020600	7029080	streaming tv coming to your xbox 360 and this is coming in november apparently um customers are now
7029080	7036120	able to use their existing xbox 360 with a hard drive as a u-verse receiver so you will be able to
7036120	7043080	um i guess stream tv to it it says must have at least one standard receiver or dvr in order for
7043080	7050040	the xbox as a set top box to work and it says uh new fields will be displayed on the tv receiver
7050040	7055560	section and blah blah uh xbox connect our connection kit will include a installation

7343880	7350840	does not give a fuck she's not amused storm ain't having it no she's like because she's awesome

7360040	7365400	out next year like yeah yeah like it's a it's first class or something it's like a prequel
7365400	7371880	or whatever yeah you know they recast everybody there was a whole comic series called x-men first
7371880	7380200	class okay all the you know new original stories from the early days okay could be interesting i
7380200	7385960	suppose but it's going to be hard without patrick stewart as professor x i'm just saying all right
7385960	7388760	uh we're not gonna do list list tonight we're gonna table that to next week so let's move on
7388760	7397000	with some more news loki uh yes um so this is kind of cool uh apparently uh mega man legends
7397000	7404680	is going to be asking people to uh submit ideas for stuff that they want to see in the game um
7404680	7411000	they're going to be asking the community to actively participate in um different development
7411000	7416040	parts uh some of the examples that they had on the one page their boss characters uh voice actors
7416040	7422280	ideas they want them all and um of course that's why project is in the title they said it would be
7422280	7428120	a collaborative experience uh but not in the way mega man universe is instead i guess the community
7428120	7433080	will be able to actively actively participate in the development of the game uh capcom unity
7433080	7438760	website will be updated with a dev room where fans will be able to submit their gameplay ideas boss
7438760	7444520	ideas character ideas and more in the future fans will be able to vie for position in the game's
7444520	7451880	voice cast pizza man do do do do do some of these character designs are really cute the
7451880	7457480	fan submitted ones yeah they don't look bad i want to be a voice actor in mega man legends
7458520	7462600	well where do i sign up you just got the sign up with the website bunny girl
7462600	7467000	i don't want to be a voice actor for bunny girl sorry
7469160	7475800	but uh yeah it's kind of cool i wonder why all this audience participation in the game is it
7475800	7480840	just a gimmick to try and sell more copies or do you think they just really want fresh ideas or
7480840	7486520	what what do you think's the motivation behind this i'm not sure uh probably just you know more
7486520	7494200	of the meta stuff because everybody likes being you know able to contribute to a game and having
7494200	7500440	their credit and stuff and it's way better than having a name web 2.0 yeah kind of stuff yeah
7501160	7507960	that makes sense all right uh that way fans can't bitch if the game sucks because you made it made
7507960	7514440	it well it's all your fault the game get bad got bad reviews all right um i think this is kind of
7514440	7519160	strange um you know how there's the kindle right and i think dark soccer you you use the kindle
7519160	7523560	i use the kindle app on my phone is that just the same thing as a kindle i don't know well the
7523560	7529720	kindle itself is the device that amazon sells you know the large one has got internet access and
7529720	7534280	shit right i just have the app for it on my phone so i can read books oh okay what can't you use
7534280	7539880	iBooks for that not for books i bought through the kindle store ah got it okay well anyhow i
7539880	7544120	bought some of my schoolbooks that way so i can carry them around on my iphone got it all right
7544120	7549720	well anyhow um kindle is of course you know it's it's a device that you know most you read books on
7549720	7557160	it but now apparently there's some games showing up on kindle i guess uh scrabble is on kindle
7557160	7561320	right now i didn't even know that but yeah scrabble actually made its way to the top of the kindle
7561320	7568600	charts but um apparently some folks have ported zork one zork two zork three and mini zork to the
7568600	7573480	kindle i didn't even know there was a mini zork but yeah zork one zork two and zork three are now
7573480	7579080	all out on the kindle that's kind of awesome um now i don't think the kindle has too much in the
7579080	7583240	way of a keyboard so i'm not sure how awesome this is i mean i think it has some keyboard but it's
7583240	7589320	kind of small so i don't know how much fun this is to play but uh yeah it's out there and uh so
7589320	7595000	you are standing in front of a white mailbox don't get eaten by a guru you can experience it all over
7595000	7604120	again there it is let's uh go to the mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we're gonna
7604120	7614120	open up ye old mailbag dive in the one email one email one email but it's fantastic well to be fair
7614120	7618760	i failed on getting the show up on time so we'll probably have double the emails next week rob
7618760	7624760	fails sorry i was sick leave me alone he brought me he brought me pita chips so i sure did and
7624760	7632040	asoda hey olr crew azhp here if you may recall rob had mentioned a few episodes ago that poo
7632040	7637080	ping would be a funny name for social networking site for people on the toilet that's right because
7637080	7643240	of a ping.com remember well i'm sorry apple's ping well i decided to run with that idea and
7643240	7652920	i'm moderately proud to bring you www.poo-ping.com wow i whipped it together over about two weeks
7652920	7657640	though since i worked a full-time job i was only able to put an hour or two a day into it
7657640	7662920	its goal is to be like yelp for public restrooms through a number of factors prevent me from
7662920	7667480	devoting much time to it the aforementioned full-time job and my lack of any sort of prowess
7667480	7672520	relating to design related to design the site does not have any features currently it only supports
7672520	7676840	adding restrooms to the database and writing reviews for those restrooms a google account is
7676840	7681240	required to submit restrooms or reviews don't worry it's using google's official google app
7681240	7686840	engine api so you don't have to worry about me stealing your information or anything this is
7686840	7690200	just the first website i've written on my own it was basically just an excuse to learn new
7690200	7694360	programming languages for the technically inclined it's written in python using the google app engine
7694360	7701640	sdk with some django integration or is it django i don't know so it's not too well polished maybe
7701640	7706440	if i find myself unemployed in the future or if you hire jamie i can get back to it or she can
7706440	7711960	make it look pretty i appreciate it if the crew or the chat could throw out some ideas that you
7711960	7716280	would like to see on the site such as an iphone app google map integration foursquare style
7716280	7721160	check-ins a friends list twitter style updates experience points based ranking system for adding
7721160	7727320	restrooms etc i can draw you pictures of poop is that really necessary yes who knows i might one
7727320	7732200	day implement them anyway hope you enjoyed it as bare bones as it is your friendly neighborhood
7732200	7739320	programmer azhp that's pretty amazing i'm looking at the site poo-ping.com and my bathroom on it
7739320	7745320	there it is the site for picky poopers there it is it's actually there and there's already a one
7745320	7753640	review on there for next tag i don't and it just talks about where there's four stalls apparently
7753640	7759560	and uh there's paper towels is the hand drying mechanism and the faucet type and uh you can
7759560	7764760	actually write a review there and talk all about it in the comment on this restroom the faucet on
7764760	7769000	the left doesn't shut off all the way unless you push down on it harder restroom is fairly clean
7769000	7775240	and paper towels and toilet paper get restocked often i'm gonna review the toilet out back i was
7775240	7778920	gonna say i should review the the bathroom at jack-in-the-box i was at before the show tonight
7778920	7785000	because uh when i turned on the sink it was so it was like on full blast i got shot with water
7785000	7788760	and it just looked like i crapped my pant like the front of my pants and i was so mad
7788760	7794440	so i was gonna write a nasty review of the sink there i don't know the address for this place
7796440	7800360	uh-oh you have to look it up can i review my bathroom
7801640	7806040	you can put whatever you want in there you want your address on there there it is poo-ping.com
7806040	7810280	that's amazing i love when our show inspires these ideas that's that's the ultimate tribute thank you
7810280	7816040	guys so much so salacious pop is saying he just thought of a mailbag for you he didn't send this
7816040	7820840	in the email but i think this is a great question and i can't wait to hear the rants this inspires
7820840	7827160	dark sakura have you seen the new gap logo and do you feel the logo would be helped by comic sans
7827160	7834200	or papyrus what the fuck let me look at it their logo is pretty weak have you not seen the new gap
7834200	7839880	logo it's like crap i need a logo right now all this new controversy no just go to gap.com i'm
7839880	7845000	going and you can see it and it's there's their new logo it's in helvetica yeah that's it that's
7845000	7852520	not helvetica it's a gap with a box i like it job really because like all these designers everywhere
7852520	7860920	are pissed they have saying that it's way better no no no no it's i like the old one better but
7860920	7869880	this isn't bad the old one just was better it was more iconic i think i think the square is retarded
7869880	7875000	yeah i don't know it's not really no the old one was better
7876760	7881400	um i just got linked this uh website that apparently has all the sounds you need
7881400	7887560	to run a radio show here and so um we could list the uh gap logo on poo-ping.com
7893560	7896040	this is what i will say about this if i may
7896040	7905800	what if this was the first time this they'd ever done a logo as in like if they hadn't had that
7905800	7910760	nice one they had before this would be fine why did they feel they needed to change their logo
7910760	7917640	in the first place it's too swiss i think the best comment i read anywhere about the new logo
7917640	7923560	is that it makes old navy look like the better brand i mean old navy looks a little classier
7923560	7930040	than gap's new logo it looks like the american apparel logo it looks like target target uses
7930040	7934600	helvetica it kind of looks like american apparel to me have you ever seen that yeah and it's too
7934600	7940120	too close it looks like um what's that tax place uh you know you know h&r block yeah it looks like
7940120	7946520	h&r block font you knew that they changed their font from futura who did ikea oh really they based
7946520	7952040	it off of a different one their theirs was like a super wide version of futura which i like that
7952040	7961560	font is pretty but they changed it i don't know i just keep in mind i love helvetica a lot this just
7961560	7968600	did you see the movie yes i have i have a copy all right i have the book i'm not joking is it
7968600	7973720	all printed in helvetica yes it's called helvetica homage to a typeface i'll go get it no it's all
7973720	7978440	right that's all right i don't care no one car all right i was gonna put it on the all right
7978440	7982040	fine you can take a picture and all that uh we gotta get into the f-years of the week though
7982040	7986520	this is the part of the show where we get really angsty and uh get mad and throw things
7986520	7994680	so
8001400	8010440	a few to my cat's butt for being too fat to lift onto her toilet box
8010440	8019160	her her litter box and pp in it properly and it's mostly my fault i should have exercised my cat
8019160	8027400	more but she only is able to pee in about half of the box and the rest of the pee will get on
8027400	8033400	the floor for for the record shermy's bathroom is in the bathroom closet and we have the bottom part
8033400	8036680	of the door sawed off so she can just climb under there and do her business in private
8036680	8042280	do her business in private um but she misses the box so like the p goes under her box and
8042280	8046920	that means i have to lift her box and clean it which is really disgusting and um but she has
8046920	8055480	not pooped during the show that's great somebody linked us in the chat room i guess there's this
8055480	8060600	website where you can generate your own gap logo and someone made olr there it is i could do that
8060600	8066760	in two seconds in photoshop nice that was laser one two three four five four three two one sent that
8067880	8072840	all right uh loki you have an fu of the week uh if you leave the cats live in my backyard because
8073480	8080760	they are pooping everywhere and it smells like poop everywhere and they need to leave the premise
8082840	8089960	is that it you need to leave the premise of the premises whatever all right if that's it then
8089960	8096040	my fu of the week i have a few uh fu to me being sick uh because it sucked and i've been sleeping
8096040	8101480	like 12 and 13 hours this weekend which is sad because i'm not gonna get to see alan next weekend
8101480	8107480	so kind of sucks that i spent this whole weekend sleeping um so yeah boo to that boo to the fact
8107480	8113000	that um midway mania was closed to california venture when i went um this last time so i'm
8113000	8117320	very upset about that because i wanted to take alan on that and i couldn't but yay to us going

8130360	8135880	that or the people who designed my bag because my laptop kind of fell out of the laptop part of my
8135880	8141960	bag and into the main part of my bag and as it was being slung around i now have a line of dead pixels
8141960	8148440	on my monitor i'm sorry to hear that yay i remembered one more fu that i had fu to windows 7
8148440	8155080	for for whatever reason removing the what you hear feature on the recording options on your sound
8155080	8160520	card i you know that's that has been the main hold up for yx for and i can't do a podcast right now
8160520	8164360	we can't figure out how to make it work for some reason it works here oh we're on xp here that's
8164360	8170920	why you know how you do it how it's sad you have to do from speaker out the line in oh yeah no
8170920	8177080	thanks that sucks or they say get a secondary usb sound card or something i've actually been looking
8177080	8182600	into that bi extra extra come on why don't i want to do a loud maybe you can help me figure out why
8182600	8190440	my mic isn't working for ventrilo might be similar so i don't know why you would even remove that
8190440	8196520	feature it's stupid yeah it sucks it depends also i i thought it was always a sound blaster feature
8196520	8201240	like if you have a sound blaster well i have i have a non-sound blaster card in my laptop here
8201240	8208200	and i can record what i hear it's just it's not you just record no uh xfer and i ran a test run
8208200	8213000	the other week or we were going to and we couldn't get his skype thing to record it just and i tried
8213000	8217240	everything we do here in studio to make the show work and it would work over there of course we use
8217240	8224200	an external mixing board too which i'm sure helps but we're just irritating ah so we'll try again
8224200	8229080	all right meanwhile back to the show we're gonna get to your phone calls soon not just yet but very
8229080	8232680	soon in the meantime though we got just a couple quick stories for you guys before we open up the
8232680	8240680	skype line at 1877 game olr yes it's interesting um you know sam ramie is working on a earth defense
8240680	8247000	force movie now obviously this is not anything to do with d3 game earth defense force the greatest
8247000	8254840	game on earth um but it is you know something where you know apparently uh aliens are invading
8254840	8260840	and the earth defense force has to you know stop them from invading or whatnot uh the details of
8260840	8265320	the movie are very rough right now here's the interesting part though and i'm not sure if sam
8265320	8275320	ramie's aware of this but apparently um earth defense force uh is actually a copyrighted name
8275320	8285480	by d3 so huh that's awkward um and actually i did see here it looks like they do have a synopsis for
8285480	8289880	earth defense force the sam ramie version apparently edf follows a u.s military unit that
8289880	8294440	has been deployed to rescue a sub that has accidentally run afoul in chinese waters
8294440	8300040	apparently a dogfight ensues and both uh but both the chinese and american planes are shot
8300040	8305720	out of the water by three alien spacecraft they go on to destroy landmarks and key military
8305720	8311720	structures it's a race against the clock as humans try to create weaponry and vehicles that can
8311720	8316680	sustain another attack just make a goddamn fucking earth defense force movie based off earth defense
8316680	8320440	force the game well they were going to call it the last airbender but unfortunately that was taken

8444040	8450520	boo-hoo hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is x-link hi x-link what's on your
8450520	8457720	mind hey never much you're like the new ron now sorry i have a cold an old orange island radio
8457720	8463640	first let's tell the people how on nba gm to get the democrats and republicans unlocked if you
8463640	8471240	want to play at them please do all right for the democrats at the press a to start screen if you
8471240	8477160	enter left 13 times followed by the plus you should be able to unlock them for the republicans
8477160	8484760	if you press on the same screen right 13 times followed by the plus you are unlock them that's
8484760	8489480	funny i get it because the democrats are on the left and the republicans are on the right
8489480	8497080	then you press down 13 times i don't know what happens if you push down 13 times the game crashes
8497080	8503160	no i don't know if you push nothing yeah nothing happens because that's what happens from the
8503160	8511400	p-side down is the tea party i get it all right by the way laser 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 is yelling at
8511400	8516120	me in chat saying just say laser we had this problem for i don't like just laser don't put
8516120	8520440	all those numbers in your name i like laser 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 it gives it gives it class
8521240	8527880	just say change your name to laser 3 2 1 contact it's even better i i that's even better i i like
8527880	8534200	that laser 3 2 1 contact i like that now thinking of the 3 2 1 contact from electric company but
8534200	8538840	that's all different scenario altogether that's right now it's stuck in your head yes definitely
8539400	8544040	but no but these two were the probably one of the hardest ones for a bit but i don't know how
8544040	8549480	somebody came across it but i was reading a few websites and somebody closely posted on there of
8549480	8554520	how to do this so that was quite interesting because for a while they're like here's the code
8554520	8560360	unlock unlock the bc boys here's the code to unlock the espn and the rest of the stuff you
8560360	8565320	pretty much are on your own unlock so well and those codes are very easy to remember actually
8565320	8570760	left 13 times that's not very hard to remember right 13 times that's not like telling almost
8570760	8574680	something did by a fluke like oh let's see what you mean hit left and see what happens is like
8574680	8578280	all of a sudden you know you hit the button and it happened you know you hit her chime and it's
8578280	8583000	like okay what did i unlock oh look i just unlocked you know and to unlock nba and nba
8583000	8587160	and to unlock nba elite you smash the remote against the ground 13 times
8589320	8595480	or track the desk in half you throw it out the window yeah i was gonna say it's not like any
8595480	8599320	of us have bought nba jam yet i don't know maybe there's a few wee people that have bought it yet
8599320	8604040	bought it so far but i sure haven't yet so you know what to be honest i was going to buy it and
8604040	8608200	then i saw the $50 price tag and that really turned me off i'm like why the hell would i pay
8608200	8614520	$50 for a just updated version of the game that came out so long ago nba jam is fucking rad it
8614520	8618760	was going to be an xbox live arcade game oh i freaking loved it i loved it playing in arcade
8618760	8622600	i remember playing all the time going through all the teams and trying to then as soon as i beat one
8622600	8627320	team with all the teams to go you know and it was like a weekly thing it was like nfl blitz did the
8627320	8631400	same uh same thing growing up with nfl blitz you start with one team you go through and then you
8631400	8635320	try because you're always trying to compete with everybody else and that in your local arcade you
8635320	8639480	try to be that top number one spot so i wish it would have done something like that but unfortunately
8639480	8645640	if you don't have the capability of online to keep uh global stats of that sort which kind of
8645640	8652600	ruins it i mean especially if you play just single player um i uh you got to admit though you you've
8652600	8656280	got to play the obama versus palin you know you want to play that and then accuse the game of
8656280	8663080	being biased you know you want to do that and the computer cheats yes all right well anything else
8663080	8668920	on your mind tonight x-link what do you think about cataclysm coming out pretty soon um i'm
8668920	8674680	scared about the new patch because it's going to change everything and as a holy paladin like on
8674680	8680760	the beta i i don't know if i can heal the same that i do now it's weird and it's a rep pally i
8680760	8685000	died like twice and that never happens rep pallys don't die like ever unless they really suck
8685960	8689720	well i mean in raids they do and in instances they do but i mean soloing like you never die
8689720	8694520	so it's it's i'm a little scared about some of the um juggling they're doing to talents but you know
8695240	8698840	these things have a way of working themselves out and you know by the time the game actually
8698840	8703320	comes out it'll be cool but um yeah if it's true that the patch is hitting this week which most
8703320	8708520	people seem to kind of agree it is it's gonna be a game changer so we'll see but you know they
8708520	8713240	always do these major patches right before so it'll be interesting do all things real quick
8713240	8717480	thank you for turning me on the game next week unfortunately i wish i got on a week before but
8717480	8722440	fortunately next week would be my one year anniversary on wow oh wow yeah yeah that's
8722440	8726280	really bizarre i was looking that up i was kind of curious and i knew it was actually next week

8926680	8935160	is coming to uh the iphone and ipod as well and of course that would be very stripped down version
8935160	8940200	of dead rising much like the wii version was also they're going to be doing something very similar
8940200	8946840	to xbox live's game room called capcom arcade which will host a bunch of virtual arcade cabinets
8946840	8953640	that require the purchase of tokens uh to play the games otherwise everything is going to be
8953640	8960600	a lot easier to play the games uh to play the games otherwise you can um permanently access
8960600	8966600	each game for a larger one-time fee uh the arcade service will launch uh before dead rising mobile
8966600	8972600	and will feature street fighter 2 ghosts and ghouls or i'm sorry ghouls and ghosts uh 1942 and commando
8973480	8977400	so this is why no one else wants to get on board with game room because now they're like oh well

9024840	9028200	dollars you'll spend if you like the retro stuff if you don't like the retro stuff then don't
9028200	9034040	bother but otherwise like if if that last story sounded interesting to you and you own a 360 or
