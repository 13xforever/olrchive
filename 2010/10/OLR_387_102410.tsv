0	20240	Tonight, October 24th, 2010, two Capcom worlds collide in an upcoming 3DS game, fans of Sonic
20240	24960	the Hedgehog up the ante in the new HD version, and in one country, Grand Theft Auto IV is
24960	31720	ordered off the shelves.
31720	36120	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36120	37120	Radio.
37120	42080	We are that radio video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
42080	47120	We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
47120	50460	www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
50460	54640	Joining you over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-hosts.
54640	58640	Say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
58640	59640	Storms lol.
59640	60640	I know right.
60640	62360	Yeah, we're having storms right now.
62360	64960	We're having rain and nobody in California knows how to deal with it.
64960	68000	Yeah, we had to do a disclaimer for live listeners because one of the people that doesn't know
68000	71440	how to handle storms is Comcast, the internet provider out here in Sacramento.
71440	72440	Exactly.
72440	76000	And so the internet has cut out at your house, what, five times today at least?
76000	77920	I know at home it's been cutting in and out.
77920	79440	Three times since I've been awake.
79440	83480	I just got a text from Alan saying it cut out again while he was trying to listen to
83480	85760	our call with Bobby before the show tonight.
85760	89760	Which is funny because in Alabama I remember being on dial-up in a hurricane.
89760	92920	I just don't know how to handle it out here.
92920	93920	They really don't.
93920	97840	And what makes it worse too is that, not to get too off kilter here, but what makes it
97840	103040	worse is that when you have this first major rain of the season as it finally is, here
103040	106560	we are the end of October, the problem is everything is so dried out from a long summer
106560	108560	that it just screws everything up.
108560	113240	And the oil floats all up to the top of the streets and it becomes a big slick and no
113240	116440	one knows how to drive in the rain.
116440	119440	But it's been raining for almost, it feels like a day straight.
119440	121440	It rained yesterday almost all day.
121440	122440	Crazy.
122440	123440	I've enjoyed it.
123440	124440	I like the rain.
124440	125440	But I've been sick.
125440	128640	So I like rain when I'm sick because then it makes all the warm food I'm eating so much
128640	129640	better.
129640	132400	And then just everybody else is having to be miserable because you're miserable, right?
132400	135000	No, I'm good because I spend most of the time asleep.
135000	136000	Really?
136000	137000	Because that's how I am.
137000	139600	I'm like, if I'm sick then I want everyone to be sick.
139600	141320	When Dan gets sick he's a big baby.
141320	145480	He just curls up on the couch and makes pathetic faces at me.
145480	147240	Is that what your cat does too?
147240	149760	She's sitting on your feet right now kind of.
149760	150760	She's purring.
150760	151760	All right.
151760	156080	Say hello of course to tech master Loki also joining us tonight as he always does.
156080	157080	Hello.
157080	158080	And complete with what?
158080	159720	Are we on quadruple bacon pizza now?
159720	160720	Not yet.
160720	164320	I didn't want to scare them with the thought of putting in four times the amount of bacon
164320	165320	on a pizza.
165320	166320	They'd have to make you sign a medical disclaimer.
166320	168840	I'd eat them into that, you know.
168840	170840	All right.
170840	171840	How have things been for you?
171840	173040	How's the baby doing?
173040	174040	Baby is fine.
174040	178760	He's, he was with mom going to her parents' house.
178760	179960	Now where's that?
179960	180960	Is that in the bay?
180960	181960	Folsom.
181960	182960	Oh, okay.
182960	183960	That's not that bad.
183960	184960	Is he pooping fine?
184960	185960	Yeah, he's pooping just fine.
185960	186960	Okay.
186960	187960	Because I remember the poop scare.
187960	188960	Inquiring minds.
188960	189960	Want to know.
189960	190960	All right.
190960	193960	Joining us in studio tonight, yes, in studio, not on Skype.
193960	198420	We love having guests actually come down to the studio and hang with us.
198420	201000	Say hello to our pal, the Seg.
201000	202000	Hello, O-L-R.
202000	203000	Hello, Seg.
203000	204520	Wonderful to be here.
204520	205520	Wonderful to have you.
205520	208120	Thank you so much for coming out here.
208120	211980	I haven't really had a chance to say it to you before we've gone live because it's just
211980	212980	been go, go, go, go.
212980	216640	Cause I was running in the door late tonight, but, um, but I did get a new mic cord for
216640	218280	Dark Sakura, so it wasn't all for naught.
218280	220120	So just saying, hopefully it works tonight.
220120	223400	I'm not having to hold it in.
223400	224400	That's what she said.
224400	225400	All right.
225400	229160	So anyway, but, uh, say you, you drove all the way here from the Bay area, which is a
229160	232080	good, well, usually it's probably about an hour and a half, but I'm going to guess because
232080	237000	of the rain, it probably took like an hour and a half, you know, I am from Detroit, so
237000	245320	I actually know how to drive, you know, Ford family here, so, well, regardless, no matter
245320	247800	how long it took you to get here, it is quite a bit of a tank of gas.
247800	251880	So I do really appreciate you coming out and hanging here in studio with us.
251880	254280	Not quite as glamorous as the sounds on the radio, huh?
254280	258760	Well, you know, you don't have to, to, to pull back the curtain for everyone out there
258760	259760	on the internet.
259760	260760	Yeah, that's all right.
260760	261760	All right.
261760	262760	Yeah.
262760	263760	I meant, uh, of course our microphones are all gold-plated.
263760	266240	This couch is absolutely wonderful.
266240	267240	Maho, maho.
267240	270000	Give me, give me more grapes, servants.
270000	271000	All right.
271000	273440	Uh, well, Saig, you are here though.
273440	275840	Of course you have ulterior motives for being here tonight.
275840	276840	Not that we mind.
276840	279480	We appreciate a reason to have you here in house, but you're here to promote a little
279480	281120	something something that's going on, right?
281120	282120	Yeah.
282120	283120	Just, just a little something.
283120	286640	You might've heard of it because, you know, we, I, gosh, we've only mentioned it on the
286640	288840	show about 50 gazillion times.
288840	289840	That's okay.
289840	293420	Cause it's, it's a charity thing and we'll say it a gazillion more times for charity.
293420	294420	What is, what is up?
294420	296360	What's, what's the, what's the big event that you are co-hosting?
296360	300700	Oom loud, a rock band night for child's play charity.
300700	305640	It's a performance based rock band night.
305640	307280	And I really stress it as performance.
307280	309140	It's not a competition.
309140	313080	We don't give a care about your score whatsoever.
313080	316320	It's all about rocking out for child's play charity.
316320	317320	Yeah.
317320	322800	No one, no one, as the old saying on the internet goes, no one Kerr, if you have a crappy score
322800	327320	on a song or what have you, you're going to get the most props if you have like, if you're
327320	329840	really into it, like the outfits and stuff.
329840	335200	Some of the stuff I saw last year, outstanding, the Lego rock band people were great.
335200	339160	There was a lots of dress ups, bands, good times.
339160	340160	Yeah.
340160	351600	Well, we started it last year under the wake of Fundrauser, which went away, but it was
351600	359680	Chris Koehler of wired.com game life blog Joe Marquette of Game Helper and myself.
359680	365920	And we put on San Francisco's child's play charity event community fundraiser for child's
365920	367520	play.
367520	371800	And last year we did it all soup to nuts within eight weeks.
371800	378120	And that's also incorporated as our own nonprofit to be all nice and legal.
378120	382960	And I guess I should talk about the band packages because that's really where we're leading
382960	383960	into.
383960	384960	Sure.
384960	385960	Why not?
385960	386960	We're all over the map, but that's okay.
386960	387960	We're everywhere.
387960	388960	That's why it's a three hour show.
388960	390200	We can never stay on one track.
390200	391200	So it's fine.
391200	392200	Take all the time you need.
392200	396880	So it's not, we don't do the just go up and play at a bar.
396880	402920	Like if you go to a bar or anything to play rock band, it's usually one screen and everyone
402920	405560	is looking at the screen.
405560	411360	What we do is have the performers turn around and face the audience and perform out to the
411360	412360	audience.
412360	417040	And there's monitors on the stage floor, but they look like speaker monitors to the audience
417040	419620	because it's next to the speaker monitors.
419620	422840	And we don't just let anyone just walk up and play.
422840	434280	We pre-order band packages where a group of friends make a donation to UMLoud on our website
434280	436240	to purchase a band package.
436240	441560	And then they have one song that they pick that no one else will play on their main stage.
441560	446600	So like if I claim a song and I say like Gaga is mine tonight, it's me.
446600	447600	I am Gaga.
447600	450080	Then nobody else can pick that same Gaga song.
450080	452400	First come first serve.
452400	455680	But yes, once it's locked in, it's yours.
455680	457360	No one else will play on the main stage.
457360	461040	Because that really sucks at like karaoke sometimes and you got like four people in
461040	466240	a row, you know, because we belong together now.
466240	468040	It's like, oh God, shut up.
468040	469040	And also-
469040	470040	They all get progressively worse.
470040	473660	Well, it's also, you know, there are 2000 songs in rock band.
473660	475120	It's going to be hard to duplicate.
475120	477600	Is that even counting the network stuff?
477600	480640	I think their 2000 count counts the network stuff.
480640	481640	Okay.
481640	483880	But still, that's a lot.
483880	488360	But the thing is, is that we don't know what's going to happen with these bands when they
488360	489360	show, especially last year.
489360	490920	We didn't know if people were going to get it.
490920	495160	I mean, we didn't know if people were just going to like, oh, I'm playing rock band or
495160	499680	like, no, this is my rock concert.
499680	503960	And there were people that got it.
503960	511760	The one band that to me really got it was Ironhead, as in the Brutal Legend game.
511760	513760	Yes, I remember that.
513760	515400	And pictures of that girl all over the internet.
515400	516400	I should plug the website.
516400	525000	If you go to umloud.org, now that's U-M-L-O-U-D, umloud.org, and you'll see the little flicker
525000	528000	button there too, and that will give you all the pictures.
528000	532880	And you'll see Ophelia there.
532880	540520	She's pretty hard to miss because she spent a couple of hours before that day being dressed
540520	543960	up in blue makeup, head to toe.
543960	547080	And I didn't know that they, I mean, I knew they were named Ironhead, knew they were doing
547080	553600	... I'm totally blanking on the song name.
553600	555240	Whatever song they did, yeah.
555240	556920	Helion Electric Eye.
556920	562160	And when they hit the stage, I saw her there dressed up and like, oh, that's one of my
562160	563600	friends.
563600	568680	And then when they performed, it was absolutely amazing.
568680	571120	They got it.
571120	575720	And this year we hope to have more that get it.
575720	579140	The ante is being upped now that people are seeing the pictures from last year.
579140	582320	It's like, how can we just even take it a step further?
582320	584560	You know, there's going to be people that are like, we can outdo.
584560	591320	And we want to facilitate that at UMLoud, which is why we're doing something additional
591320	592320	to the event.
592320	596560	Now, the ultimate band package, that's the band package that we did last year, and then
596560	601320	we're still doing, those go on sale November 1st.
601320	607760	But we decided we wanted to do one really special package that we're calling the Headliner
607760	609080	Band.
609080	614560	And this package is, there's only one of them, because it's the headliner.
614560	620400	So it's auctioned off, and it's actually going on right now through eBay.
620400	623320	And they get a two song set.
623320	627840	And as long as they don't dilly dally, they get first choice for the night to reserve
627840	629980	those two songs.
629980	631120	And they're the headliners.
631120	636920	So obviously they're on the flyers, they're on the posters, they're on the video that
636920	637920	we make.
637920	644520	We actually have Area 5, which is a video production company that will be making the
644520	651600	commercials and, assuming schedules gel well, will be doing the video for us with the Headliner
651600	652720	Band.
652720	658640	And you get your own place at DNA Lounge, which is the venue that we're in, with drink
658640	660680	and food service all provided to you.
660680	662360	So you can have people feed you grapes?
662360	663360	Yes.
663360	665360	All right, awesome.
665360	668960	I'm liking this so far.
668960	675520	And that's going on now, and that auction actually ends Thursday at 4pm-ish.
675520	683140	And we really hope we get a lot of people bidding on that thing, because the donation
683140	684800	all goes to Child's Play.
684800	687440	I was going to stress, this money is not going to SEG.
687440	688440	No.
688440	690420	This money is not going to DNA Lounge.
690420	692640	This money is going to charity.
692640	693640	All of it, right?
693640	694640	Yes.
694640	699000	It's going to Child's Play charity, which provides video games, toys, and other financial
699000	702320	support to children's hospitals around the globe.
702320	708400	And it's kind of known as the Penny Arcade charity, but even Penny Arcade wants to stress
708400	712920	that it's not like, oh, this is directly all Penny Arcade.
712920	721240	They want to stress that this is, yes, they house the offices and the staff for it, but...
721240	723920	They planted the seed, but it's grown into its own thing.
723920	729280	And especially with all of the community fundraisers that happen, like Goomlap, but also Desert
729280	733600	Bus for Hope, and the Mario Marathon, and all the others.
733600	738480	These are people, Child's Play itself just is the direct servicer.
738480	747160	They take the money and directly deal with the child's life services, or equivalent of
747160	749120	the children's hospitals and their network.
749120	752160	And they get the toys there.
752160	755920	They make what toys are needed and all that.
755920	760000	So what's given is exactly what the hospital needs.
760000	766940	And what the community fundraisers do is help in very creative, unique ways to raise money
766940	767940	for this charity.
767940	775120	And it's actually the envy of nonprofits because every year for Child's Play has beaten its
775120	780920	high score the previous year, including the past two years when that shouldn't have happened,
780920	784720	economic downturn.
784720	792560	And Child's Play was one of the very, very few charities that increased their giving.
792560	798040	And that's everything to do with these community fundraisers across the globe.
798040	800400	Do you guys have a fundraising goal set for Goomlap this year?
800400	802880	Is that one of those, you know, I don't want to talk about it type of things?
802880	805940	Well, it kind of is.
805940	807720	We always want to do more.
807720	819680	And we just focus that energy on making the best event without making much cost on how
819680	820680	to put on the event.
820680	821680	Okay.
821680	823060	And we have a lot of partners that help us.
823060	824060	Let me ask this.
824060	825400	Can I ask how much we raised last year?
825400	831440	Last year, I wrote the checkout and mailed it in for $7,000 to Child's Play.
831440	832440	Nice.
832440	833440	Very nice.
833440	837800	And, you know, that was eight weeks of putting everything together.
837800	839440	It was kind of last moment.
839440	842760	So this year, we hope to improve on the situation.
842760	843760	And also a lot...
843760	844760	Umlaut is...
844760	848080	Just for the record, I would have never known that it only took eight weeks to do if you
848080	849080	hadn't told me.
849080	850080	Yeah.
850080	851080	You guys did a really good job last year.
851080	852080	I know.
852080	854680	I don't even know how we did it.
854680	856520	And I'm not just saying that because you're a friend.
856520	858960	You really was a smooth operation.
858960	861200	But, you know, we also have good partners.
861200	867840	DNA Lounge, Jamie Zawinski, the owner, and Barry, and all of them over there are just
867840	871360	absolutely wonderful to us.
871360	874500	You know, we definitely make sure they're in the loop.
874500	876920	We definitely respect them as the venue.
876920	877920	And they...
877920	878920	Harmonics isn't on this too, right?
878920	879920	Oh, yeah.
879920	880920	Yeah.
880920	881920	And harmonics.
881920	882920	Oh, I should say.
882920	889840	We will have every song playable in Rock Band 3 as in...
889840	892480	Harmonics has a magic box that has them all, right?
892480	893480	Yeah.
893480	897120	They have the magic boxes of dev kits that they will...
897120	898120	And they fly people out.
898120	903260	John Drake and crew will fly out for our event with the dev kits.
903260	904400	And we actually have two stages.
904400	909460	So I know I've been stressing the main stage and the performances there, which is the show
909460	910460	in itself.
910460	914040	But there's a lot of other things that we have there.
914040	919840	We have in the lounge room, the second room, free play Rock Band, show up.
919840	925320	We have the donation bin out there to kind of guilt you, but it's free play.
925320	926800	We don't care to walk up.
926800	930240	You know, that's your traditional sort of like bar Rock Band setting.
930240	931280	And that's free play.
931280	933880	Last year was like the Beatles room because that was the big game last year.
933880	936640	And this year is just kind of whatever is clever.
936640	941640	Well, we don't know what we're gonna have special yet for...
941640	945560	We don't know what we have special yet for this year.
945560	951600	But last year we debuted before it came out, the Rubber Soul album from Beatles Rock Band,
951600	952600	which was...
952600	954320	Which is the best and is sitting in my closet right there.
954320	955920	It's somewhere in there.
955920	958640	Well, am I gonna get Jamie to go with me this year?
958640	961020	Maybe she can belt out a tune or two.
961020	962020	Maybe.
962020	963020	On the Beast, I will make you go on the main stage.
963020	964020	Actually, let me ask this.
964020	966860	I'm sorry to take this wheel in another direction, but this question has been kind of like lingering
966860	968160	on my mind.
968160	971200	Maybe I'm not a person that wants to get up in front of the crowd.
971200	972200	You know what?
972200	973200	I don't...
973200	974900	I want to help the charity, but I don't...
974900	975900	I don't...
975900	978500	Singing in front of people is not my thing.
978500	980520	What fun things can I expect to have at UMLoud?
980520	982800	Well, first of all, it's the performances.
982800	985760	As I said, they are performances.
985760	989520	And if you search YouTube for UMLoud, you'll see what I mean.
989520	996920	I mean, yes, the cell phone cameras, but you'll see the kind of performances.
996920	1006880	And that alone is worth the $10 door, but we don't stop there.
1006880	1014120	We will have what's been called the nerd yard sale.
1014120	1016440	And we get...
1016440	1024380	We clean out the closets of various game studios and developers and publishers and news outlets
1024380	1028760	and all that to clean out all the swag they've collected for the year and just put it on
1028760	1029760	the table.
1029760	1035120	And if you pay for the door, you pick one thing from the table.
1035120	1037480	So you at least walk out with something.
1037480	1043440	But in addition, we're going to have a raffle and some pretty good prizes, if I do say so
1043440	1045120	myself.
1045120	1046240	We'll be announcing those.
1046240	1047360	A lot of...
1047360	1051640	Right now, our attention is all on the bands because we're trying to get this auction that
1051640	1058080	finished on... it ends Thursday, and then the following Monday is when we get the ultimate
1058080	1059080	band.
1059080	1063560	So we're kind of geared towards that, and then we make the push of, please show up.
1063560	1068240	Well, I wanted you to get that out there, that there was that going on, because we do...
1068240	1072520	Believe it or not, there are a few friends of our show that work at various developers
1072520	1076040	and things, and even though I know they don't email us or talk to us all the time because
1076040	1080680	they don't want to talk about their projects, if you happen to work for a developer or some
1080680	1086560	type of game studio and you have some extra stuff sitting in a storage room that maybe
1086560	1092880	some fans might want, Umlaut would be a great charity to kind of give those to, right?
1092880	1093880	Yes.
1093880	1100440	We actually are looking for sponsors, both financial as well as gifts and all that.
1100440	1109200	We are our own non-profit, so we are our own 501c3 in case people are a little weary of
1109200	1110800	not giving directly to Child's Play.
1110800	1118280	First of all, yes, it's going to Child's Play, and donating to us directly is also legal
1118280	1122000	in the state of California and the United States as a non-profit.
1122000	1131000	So please, if you want to give us stuff or be a financial partner with us, please, please,
1131000	1132840	please go to umlaut.org.
1132840	1136640	There's that sponsor link there, and we would love to talk to you.
1136640	1139400	I could probably look through the vault and find you swag.
1139400	1141400	That'd be awesome.
1141400	1147600	I've got like a dozen left of those Metal Gear Solid behind the scenes things.
1147600	1152440	So if they're just collecting dust here, absolutely, it'd be great charity for OLR to pitch in
1152440	1153440	and help out.
1153440	1154440	So, excellent.
1154440	1156640	Maybe I have a few more Capcom pillowcases.
1156640	1162120	Well, I'm trying to think what else to kind of get out here before we move on with the
1162120	1163120	show.
1163120	1166120	I'll ask you more maybe later on in the show, part B, kind of about what goes into the actual
1166120	1170840	planning of the event, but as far as the event itself, anything else we need to know about
1170840	1172760	what's coming up December 9th?
1172760	1174440	It's Thursday, December 9th.
1174440	1176920	I stress the Thursday because last year was on Wednesday.
1176920	1184560	We leveled up to Thursday, and if we get more people, we may be able to level up for weekend.
1184560	1188440	So it's really important for people to show up.
1188440	1194000	So if you're anywhere remotely near the Bay Area, please come on down.
1194000	1199720	And tickets, if tickets are on sale right now, you can click on tickets on the website
1199720	1204040	if you know you're not going to be in a band, but do want to show up, that's really helpful
1204040	1205040	for us.
1205040	1209800	I should also note that if you are in a band package, you're on the guest list, you get
1209800	1213120	in, you're good.
1213120	1218280	But if you have any inkling of showing up, please show up.
1218280	1221240	You will not regret it.
1221240	1225080	And for those of our listeners, because we are, believe it or not, an international show,
1225080	1230480	we have folks that listen to the show in Mexico, in Sweden, and all these places, as much as
1230480	1233680	we really want them to come, they're probably not going to be able to swing it, but there
1233680	1236600	are ways they can still participate if they're very far away, right?
1236600	1237600	Yes.
1237600	1241720	We have the donation button right on every single page at nlal.org.
1241720	1247600	Which is if you, Child's Play uses PayPal for direct donations.
1247600	1252720	We use Google Checkout, and we don't want, I want to stress that we're not trying to
1252720	1257160	like take money, or to have this like bidding war between who donates to Child's Play and
1257160	1261320	who donates to UMLoud because it's going the same place anyways, but you know, if you feel
1261320	1265000	more comfortable with Google Checkout, the donation button's there for you.
1265000	1272120	If you want to go straight to Child's Play, awesome, it's childsplaycharity.org, and that
1272120	1275240	just goes such a long way.
1275240	1276360	Absolutely.
1276360	1280120	And I have a good feeling you're going to beat that $7,000 this year, I have a really
1280120	1281120	good feeling.
1281120	1282120	I sure bloody hope so.
1282120	1283120	All right.
1283120	1286880	Well, best of luck, Seg, and of course you're going to be sitting in on the show tonight,
1286880	1289600	so feel free to chime in on anything gaming related and so forth.
1289600	1290600	Oh, I'll have opinions.
1290600	1295480	Oh, I bet you will, especially, there might be stories about a particular developer that
1295480	1296480	might be of...
1296480	1297480	Oh yeah, that.
1297480	1299360	Yes, of interest to you, but we'll see.
1299360	1302400	All right, moving on, we are in, yes, start talking.
1302400	1308480	I'm telling the chat room that if I can get $150 in donations tonight, I'll sing.
1308480	1310480	Oh, really?
1310480	1313560	The proverbial gauntlet has been thrown down.
1313560	1319680	If you guys can scrounge up $150 in donations to UMLoud, then Dark Soccer, you are saying
1319680	1322760	you will get up on that stage and you will sing?
1322760	1324760	Yes.
1324760	1329560	I can't put into words what a big freaking deal that is.
1329560	1330960	I just want to put out there.
1330960	1333840	Because everybody but me thinks I can sing.
1333840	1335920	Dark Soccer is actually a pretty good singer.
1335920	1339280	Can we extend that maybe through the next week for our podcastees who maybe aren't listening
1339280	1340280	live tonight?
1340280	1342720	If we get $150 tonight, I'll sing.
1342720	1344720	Oh, okay, you're throwing down.
1344720	1349720	If we don't get $150 tonight, if we get $250 by next weekend...
1349720	1351800	She's throwing all these random numbers out there.
1351800	1354080	No, seriously, because there's a method of my madness.
1354080	1359960	If we don't hit $150 tonight, and they have a way of saying donate in the name of...
1359960	1368640	But if they go through the UMLoud donation button, I have obviously no access to the
1368640	1369640	Child's Play 1.
1369640	1370640	Yeah.
1370640	1371640	But...
1371640	1372640	Yeah.
1372640	1383680	There should be some sort of note, I think.
1383680	1386600	We'll figure out the logistics.
1386600	1389400	If you do donate...
1389400	1396200	If there isn't some place to put it in, obviously, can people email...
1396200	1399560	Let's have them email the receipt number.
1399560	1402160	Email your receipt to Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.
1402160	1403160	Perfect.
1403160	1404160	That works.
1404160	1408280	But if you can't put it on there, make sure you say, For Orange Lounge Radio.
1408280	1409280	All right.
1409280	1410280	Or something about...
1410280	1417920	And if you happen to buy a million copies of Eye of Judgment tonight, how about if we
1417920	1418920	can...
1418920	1422040	How much money can we raise to get Loki to go to the show in a tingle outfit?
1422040	1423040	No.
1423040	1426240	How about if we can raise $1,000 by the night of the...
1426240	1427760	No, I am not going.
1427760	1428760	We gotta watch it.
1428760	1433880	Okay, if we can raise $1,000, but then I'll dress as freaking tingle shit.
1433880	1436400	Uh-oh.
1436400	1437400	She said it.
1437400	1438400	She said it.
1438400	1439400	All right.
1439400	1440400	Okay, okay.
1440400	1448600	If we can raise $1,000 by the night of UMLoud, I will go as a Para Para girl.
1448600	1450200	Blonde wig and all.
1450200	1451200	All right.
1451200	1452200	Well, regardless of how much...
1452200	1453200	I'll wear some costume.
1453200	1456400	Regardless of how much is raised tonight or until the night, you're at least gonna go
1456400	1457400	to the show, I hope.
1457400	1458400	Yeah.
1458400	1459400	Absolutely.
1459400	1460400	All right, good.
1460400	1461400	Yay.
1461400	1462400	Oh, she went to school that night.
1462400	1463400	Cut class.
1463400	1464400	All right.
1464400	1465400	I think about it.
1465400	1466400	All right.
1466400	1467400	Tell the teacher it's for charity.
1467400	1468400	All right.
1468400	1469400	Anyhow.
1469400	1470400	Let's move on.
1470400	1471400	Talk about our gaming weeks.
1471400	1475480	We're gonna talk a little bit about what types of video games we have been playing this week.
1475480	1477240	Usually it's how we start off the show, but you know what?
1477240	1478720	We have charity things to talk about tonight.
1478720	1481520	So we're gonna start now with how was your gaming week?
1481520	1483960	Dark Soccer, what kind of video games you've been playing this week?
1483960	1487480	Well, I just played something that I'm gonna be talking about later on in the show, so
1487480	1489480	I won't talk about it right now.
1489480	1492720	What else did I play?
1492720	1496680	Bayonetta, because she is a sexy bitch.
1496680	1498840	And what else did I play?
1498840	1501680	I played some Final Fantasy 13.
1501680	1504760	I tried to play some Star Trek Online, but I'm pissed off at the Borg right now.
1504760	1506160	Very, very pissed.
1506160	1511560	Okay, if somebody knows how to pass a stupid Borg mission, let me know, because I am pissed
1511560	1512560	off at it.
1512560	1514720	It just says, Defeat Borg, steal data.
1514720	1515720	Can I tell a quick side story?
1515720	1516920	There's 50 of them in there.
1516920	1517920	It's a viniculum.
1517920	1518920	What?
1518920	1521040	Can I tell a quick side story that made me think of you today?
1521040	1525520	I was playing WoW this morning, and I was in a party for the holiday event with a Boomkin
1525520	1528160	whose name was Tom Paris.
1528160	1529160	And we did a very...
1529160	1532040	The tank disconnected because of this bug going on in WoW right now.
1532040	1537720	So the Moonkin had to tank the boss, which is kind of funny if you know how WoW works.
1537720	1541440	So I said at the end of the fight, I said, Janeway would be very proud of you, Tom Paris.
1541440	1543680	And he said, Oh, that's my rogue.
1543680	1547140	Ah, that's great.
1547140	1549380	So it made me think of you, because it's all Star Trek nerds.
1549380	1550380	That's great.
1550380	1551380	Why isn't he playing Star Trek Online?
1551380	1552380	He probably is.
1552380	1556520	He must be on a Mac.
1556520	1558560	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1558560	1562080	I have several friends who actually can't play Star Trek Online anymore because they
1562080	1565760	don't have it for Mac.
1565760	1566760	Hurry up!
1566760	1567760	Get it out!
1567760	1569760	Um, oh yeah.
1569760	1575240	And I also played a lot of Plants vs. Zombies, and because I'm addicted, addicted, addicted
1575240	1586000	to jackpot mode in Plants vs. Zombies and zombie bowling.
1586000	1589160	And um, I played a bunch of other stuff too.
1589160	1591600	Oh, I've given up on Arbacular Drop.
1591600	1593060	I'm done with it.
1593060	1594060	Given up.
1594060	1596960	Oh, and I played some Portal.
1596960	1598520	You just decided to move on to Portal.
1598520	1599520	Yeah.
1599520	1602640	Well, I mean, Portal is more polished, you know?
1602640	1605080	And Arbacular Drop is a great concept.
1605080	1607920	And Portal is just the better execution.
1607920	1609480	Alright.
1609480	1611140	I smell baked goods.
1611140	1613240	Anything else for your gaming week, Dar Sakura?
1613240	1614240	Meh.
1614240	1616200	Alright, let's move on to Loki.
1616200	1617340	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1617340	1619160	I didn't play a whole lot of stuff.
1619160	1626120	I played, um, I think some Plants vs. Zombies.
1626120	1628080	I haven't really been playing that much this week.
1628080	1631920	No, the only iOS game I think I've really been playing a lot of recently is-
1631920	1632920	Do I have a unicorn attack?
1632920	1634680	Uh, no, actually not that.
1634680	1637640	I did play some last week though on the show of that.
1637640	1642040	No, I've been actually addicted to Cartoon Wars 2.
1642040	1644040	It's a tower defense game.
1644040	1647920	And with stick figures, except they have, like, heavy artillery and stuff.
1647920	1648920	It's pretty awesome.
1648920	1653640	They have everything from, like, you know, medieval weapons, swords, spears, bow and
1653640	1658760	arrows and stuff to giant mechs and bazookas and all that fun stuff.
1658760	1660240	So it's pretty fun.
1660240	1663000	I'm just grinding along right now.
1663000	1668400	And then, um, you know, I played a little bit of DJ Hero 2.
1668400	1671060	And I'm totally digging the new songs in there.
1671060	1674120	Although they're still just, like, the first game, but I mean, I guess it's gonna be with
1674120	1675120	every game that comes out.
1675120	1677400	There's a bunch of songs that I don't really care for.
1677400	1682560	Like, I really wish they would stop putting all these, like, old school, um, like, seriously,
1682560	1686760	we do not need any more Jackson 5 music in the goddamn DJ Hero series.
1686760	1690320	No more Jackson 5 at all.
1690320	1699000	And some of, like, the old 90s rap stuff that's in there, um, is alright, but I don't know.
1699000	1703440	I just think they need more variety in some of the songs, because I can only hear so many
1703440	1709800	remixes of California, you know, before I just get sick of it.
1709800	1711800	Um, or OPP.
1711800	1719220	Yeah, it's too bad you can't get, uh, your, like, the booty mashups or that kind of level
1719220	1722960	because, you know, they have to, like, actually get the licensing for the music.
1722960	1724160	More gorillas!
1724160	1725160	More gorillas!
1725160	1729320	Yeah, they have the Stylo, um, mix with itself, yeah.
1729320	1731080	I need, I need to hear that one.
1731080	1732080	I love Stylo.
1732080	1733080	I love the whole album.
1733080	1737880	It is a lot harder than the first game, which is something that's, uh, worth noting.
1737880	1742440	Like, I, I mainly just play in medium, but just because I haven't played enough DJ Hero
1742440	1747760	of the War, I was, I think at one point, starting to go on hard and stuff, um, to get to expert
1747760	1752840	and all that fun stuff, but I like kinda just playing it more relaxed instead of just trying
1752840	1758520	to mash buttons like crazy in it, and even on medium, it's mashing buttons like crazy
1758520	1766200	with a lot of the songs, like the Firestarter remix with itself, um, it was just insanely,
1766200	1770120	it was more difficult than I had anticipated, you know, for a song like that, you know,
1770120	1771400	one of the first songs that's in the game.
1771400	1776640	Oh, hey, it's really hard, but, uh, yeah, I'm digging it.
1776640	1782800	I like the, the, um, setup in the game, and the best part, of course, is playing as your
1782800	1783800	avatar.
1783800	1785760	So, you can DJ your own game.
1785760	1787760	I have it on PlayStation, so.
1787760	1789760	Well, that's why you chose Badda-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
1789760	1790760	Exactly.
1790760	1791760	Oh, no.
1791760	1792760	You've got the soundboard.
1792760	1795800	I'm sorry, I didn't load the soundboard before.
1795800	1799760	Now, do they have it where you can play as your home character, because, you know, Sony's
1799760	1802320	really innovative with all their home features, right?
1802320	1805240	Are you really asking that?
1805240	1806240	Like really?
1806240	1807240	Oh, Sony.
1807240	1809240	I want to play it with my own me.
1809240	1810240	You know what?
1810240	1812240	Let me, let me answer that with a sound.
1812240	1816440	Delayed radio, boys and girls, thank you.
1816440	1819640	I used the toilet today during the other podcast.
1819640	1821160	During that other show?
1821160	1822680	Which I have to say something about soon.
1822680	1823680	All right, we'll get to it.
1823680	1824680	We'll get to it during housekeeping.
1824680	1828680	We're hopefully going to have, we're hopefully going to have some DJ Hero music during the
1828680	1836000	break, although smart me forgot to bring my stupid, uh, VGA cable for my 360.
1836000	1842120	So I'm trying this really, you know, um, I guess MacGyver way of getting it to work by
1842120	1845760	hooking up my video capture card through my PC.
1845760	1849960	But uh, it doesn't like the fact that it's on two different networks, so I have to plug
1849960	1851520	it into the router.
1851520	1856560	But the router's cords are so short that I can't pull it out.
1856560	1857880	And Grand Theft Auto, that's what I played this week.
1857880	1860000	You can't pull it out?
1860000	1861000	Can't pull the router out.
1861000	1862000	Oh.
1862000	1866440	I don't want us to just start disconnecting random cords cause as if the storms weren't
1866440	1867760	causing enough problems with internet out.
1867760	1870520	Just last thing we need is Loki.
1870520	1871760	I think doing stuff.
1871760	1873480	I think I can pull the gray cord.
1873480	1874480	All right.
1874480	1875680	Cut the red wire.
1875680	1880440	We're running long tonight anyway, so if you can't do the music, it's all right.
1880440	1882440	Oh, okay.
1882440	1884200	I'll just take a look at it.
1884200	1885200	All right.
1885200	1886200	Anyhow, let's free cookies.
1886200	1887200	Yes.
1887200	1888200	Cookies.
1888200	1889200	We'll make it all better.
1889200	1890200	All right.
1890200	1891200	Uh, Seg, how was your gaming week?
1891200	1894360	So I've been so busy, but I know you were going to ask me this question, so I really
1894360	1897600	made it a point to actually play games.
1897600	1908520	And I've been playing Costume Quest, which just came out on Xbox and PlayStation 3's
1908520	1910640	downloadable service.
1910640	1918600	And this is Double Fine's first let's not make a game once every five years game.
1918600	1922720	And it's really good.
1922720	1929240	They set out to make a nice, I'll say light RPG.
1929240	1938080	And the concept is you either play, I'll say the two main characters are twins, a guy and
1938080	1939080	a girl.
1939080	1942940	And there's literally the point in the intro cut scene where you pick which one you're
1942940	1946160	going to, which gender you're going to be pretty much.
1946160	1951880	And the one you didn't pick gets kidnapped by monsters who are trying to collect candy.
1951880	1955600	But the adults think that they're just big kids dressed up so that you don't believe
1955600	1958200	the kids that there are real monsters out there.
1958200	1960200	It sounds like Saw for children.
1960200	1961620	Well, the...
1961620	1962760	Make your choice.
1962760	1965440	And you're wearing costumes because it's Halloween.
1965440	1971160	But when you go into battle mode, the costumes that are like, you know, cardboard and tape,
1971160	1975480	they turn into those characters in battle mode.
1975480	1979920	So there's a robot costume and then, you know, when they go into battle mode, they turn in
1979920	1985800	basically your robot mech warrior type character.
1985800	1989640	I'd totally be down for a G-rated Saw movie.
1989640	1990640	What would be the point?
1990640	1993480	It would be funny.
1993480	1999840	Anyhow, I've also been playing Game Dev Story on the iPhone because, you know, I can't get
1999840	2003080	enough of game development.
2003080	2004400	And it's a nice little game.
2004400	2012320	It feels like it was a cell phone game, like your, you know, before the iPhone, you know,
2012320	2015200	the days of before, before, before.
2015200	2024560	But it's a really nice little game that I can play a little bit and put it to a side.
2024560	2036200	And then I got something else as I pull out my Rock Band keyboard, and I've been playing
2036200	2045600	Rock Band 3 over the weekend for research for Room Loud, because, you know, because...
2045600	2047520	There's no fun to be had this weekend.
2047520	2048520	Oh, no.
2048520	2055040	Well, it really is because we really try to make the main stage as smooth as possible
2055040	2061040	because the more time we dilly-dally, the less bands get on stage, and we can't stop
2061040	2064320	the rock, cannot stop the rock.
2064320	2066280	So are you going to have up to seven people?
2066280	2067280	Because...
2067280	2068280	Yeah.
2068280	2069280	Awesome.
2069280	2073320	You know, obviously, if it's a Rock Band 1 song, well, you know, it's a Rock Band 1 song.
2073320	2076480	But if the song supports it, yeah.
2076480	2079880	So for harmonies, though, we have all three mics, and they're actually plugged into the
2079880	2083440	sound system before they're plugged into the game.
2083440	2088040	So we just have the mics on all the time, and people can just do harmonies or whatever
2088040	2090020	anyway.
2090020	2093480	So even if you have, like, a Rock Band 1 song, if you want to have backup singers anyway,
2093480	2094480	no harm, no foul.
2094480	2095480	No harm, no foul.
2095480	2096480	Yeah.
2096480	2098240	And it's not about the score anyway.
2098240	2099240	Exactly.
2099240	2100880	So, awesome.
2100880	2105040	It gives the sound engineer actual control with the voice, and then, you know, to make
2105040	2107160	you sound good.
2107160	2110080	So I know you haven't been able to spend a lot of quality time with Rock Band 3, but
2110080	2112760	what do you think at first impressions, a worthy upgrade?
2112760	2120040	It is definitely harmonics finally putting into practice the years of research and all
2120040	2121040	the things they've learned.
2121040	2124760	Not that they haven't, but it's just, they now, they got it.
2124760	2131960	You know, like, then they're able to put it together, and it really shows.
2131960	2138660	I like how career mode is sort of always on, in the sense that even when you're just doing
2138660	2141080	quick play, it's still contributing to.
2141080	2142080	That's so awesome.
2142080	2143080	Thank you.
2143080	2150280	Yeah, so there is career activities, like, very, you know, structured career activities
2150280	2157800	of like, okay, here's two songs and a set of five go, and then, you know, an achievement
2157800	2158800	is associated with that.
2158800	2165440	But just in general and in broad is just play the game, and it's just always, it's ranking
2165440	2166440	up.
2166440	2169160	It's more of raking up the personal, your personal account.
2169160	2173720	So it's really stressing more of bringing your profile, putting it on your USB stick
2173720	2179240	when you go to your friends, and then you're raking up when you're at your friends' place
2179240	2180240	and doing that profile.
2180240	2181240	Oh, cool.
2181240	2182240	Well, that sounds really interesting that they're doing that.
2182240	2183240	Yeah.
2183240	2184240	So you don't have to make all these separate bands anymore.
2184240	2185240	That's kind of cool.
2185240	2186240	Sounds very interesting.
2186240	2189080	So, um, let me ask this real quick.
2189080	2191040	What was the first song you had to play?
2191040	2194120	What was the first song I should have recorded that?
2194120	2198600	Ah, oh, I thought there might have been, no, I forgot.
2198600	2203640	I started doing career path and I just, I'm totally blanking on it, but the first, uh,
2203640	2212340	keyboard song, uh, Rock Lobster, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, which are the correct
2212340	2214680	answer should have been Bohemian Rhapsody.
2214680	2217520	Oh, I'm sorry, SAG.
2217520	2218520	You lose.
2218520	2219520	No, I'm saving.
2219520	2221640	Ah, that button's never going to get old.
2221640	2222640	That's my favorite button.
2222640	2227240	But, uh, no, I'm saving that for when I, when I play with, uh, friends of mine.
2227240	2231960	So get that you need a band for, cause it was just me playing alone.
2231960	2232960	Fair counterpoint.
2232960	2233960	All by myself.
2233960	2235500	I saw the trailer for Pro Mode.
2235500	2238120	That was pretty crazy with the new guitars.
2238120	2239120	Yeah.
2239120	2240120	Wow.
2240120	2241120	Yeah.
2241120	2242120	The, the, the pro guitars.
2242120	2243120	Um, damn.
2243120	2247240	And the, the MIDI Stratocaster that they're working on?
2247240	2252480	Well, actually the, so the, the MIDI stuff like the, the Rock Band 3 keyboard itself
2252480	2253680	is MIDI out ready.
2253680	2262360	It has, it is a MIDI keyboard and, um, they, on November 28th, they'll have a breakout
2262360	2270920	box, uh, for real professional MIDI instruments and just to plug it in directly into, uh,
2270920	2273280	the console itself.
2273280	2276480	I can't, I can't tell you how excited I am for Pro Mode keyboards.
2276480	2277480	Oh yeah.
2277480	2278480	Oh yeah.
2278480	2281160	And that's, that's, that's, that's beauty because you can do Pro Mode with the Rock
2281160	2282160	Band.
2282160	2283160	Yeah.
2283160	2284160	Keyboard.
2284160	2290560	I mean, the, the only thing that you out and out need new equipment for is guitar for Pro
2290560	2292200	in regards to Pro Mode.
2292200	2295520	Drums, you do need the add on the, for the extra simples.
2295520	2299040	You're talking about the new ones cause the old ones kind of suck.
2299040	2303560	Well they're not doing a new, new Rock Band drum set.
2303560	2305080	They fixed the cymbals a bit.
2305080	2306080	They made it more sensitive.
2306080	2311760	But the cymbals, the add on pack is new, but they're not, there's no Rock Band 3 drum base,
2311760	2313320	you know, the, the base of the drum kit.
2313320	2314840	There's no new Rock Band 3 one.
2314840	2318480	It's just, they're now packaging it with the new, uh, cymbals.
2318480	2322400	They don't have Pro Mode for singing in there.
2322400	2323400	No.
2323400	2324920	Well, what, what is Pro Mode?
2324920	2325920	Well, you get harmonies.
2325920	2326920	Pro Mode's Oom-Loud.
2326920	2329360	Ah, nice.
2329360	2330360	Like that.
2330360	2334600	And honestly, if you go into whatever the hard mode is, it's pretty hard.
2334600	2335600	Yeah.
2335600	2341080	On Beatles Rock Band, I mean, these are songs that I grew up with that I wasn't hitting
2341080	2342080	perfectly.
2342080	2343080	So.
2343080	2348760	It, it, I also do want, you know, John Drake will, will thank me for this, you know, Pro
2348760	2356120	Mode is great when you want to go to Pro Mode, but don't feel that you're losing the essence
2356120	2359760	of Rock Band if that, that just doesn't attract you.
2359760	2365720	Um, I've actually, we're actually discussing taking a guitar, Pro Guitar off the table
2365720	2369000	for Oom-Loud just because it's too new.
2369000	2375240	It's an instrument switch and we want to focus on performance, you know, people performing
2375240	2377200	and not just going on this technical prowess.
2377200	2380760	I think you, you would be fair to say, you know what, it's too much of a pain in the
2380760	2382720	butt to swap out the guitars every time.
2382720	2386240	Now all you have to say is those guitars are too damn expensive.
2386240	2387240	Done.
2387240	2388240	Sorry.
2388240	2389240	Uh-uh.
2389240	2391200	We sold the guitar and gave the money to kids.
2391200	2392200	Deal.
2392200	2393200	All right.
2393200	2394200	All right.
2394200	2398240	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us?
2398240	2403000	Um, a little bit of a Scott Pilgrim, trying to finish that out, but then Costume Quest
2403000	2404000	came out.
2404000	2405000	So there's that.
2405000	2406000	All right.
2406000	2409280	Since I, I'm going to get crap from Bobby Blackwell if I don't try to try to get you
2409280	2414040	free info on this at some point, because since you haven't brought it up, your day job, you
2414040	2420120	do work for a certain developer out there that makes a lot of amazing adventure games.
2420120	2425080	Um, is Back to the Future as awesome as it sounds?
2425080	2428120	Oh, it sounds awesome.
2428120	2434280	Because if you go to TelltaleGames.com and go to the blog tab, you'll, it's on game trailers,
2434280	2446080	but we just, or Telltale just posted the quick little interview with the voice of Marty McFly,
2446080	2452560	who, it isn't Michael J. Fox, though, he, he did give likeness rights and all that.
2452560	2454960	And I'm trying to...
2454960	2457040	He sounds very close to Michael J. Fox.
2457040	2460320	Yeah, and let's not forget Michael J. Fox is about twice as old as he was when the movie
2460320	2461920	first came out, so, you know.
2461920	2466200	And I, I still have to say, he didn't give his likeness rights for the pinball table,
2466200	2469000	so this is kind of big.
2469000	2475720	Um, AJ LaRosso, I'm, I'm probably mispronouncing his last name and I apologize, but all I'm
2475720	2483120	just going to say, go to the video and, and, and, and you'll, you'll hear how good it sounds.
2483120	2484600	Now did you get Biff?
2484600	2493320	Uh, I, you know, AJ is doing a great job with sticking on target, um, uh, we do also have
2493320	2497280	Christopher Lloyd as, as doc, he's voicing and everything.
2497280	2500560	You need to seriously get him to say every word in the dictionary because that guy is
2500560	2501560	not getting it.
2501560	2502560	Get him while he can.
2502560	2504320	Yeah, get the phenom table on him, yeah.
2504320	2508720	All right, I'm not going to pry too much on the day job because I respect that, you know,
2508720	2511160	you're a friend and we don't want to see you get fired for saying too much on the show.
2511160	2513160	Well, talk about my game, like, puzzle issue.
2513160	2516160	Let's talk about what's out.
2516160	2517160	Puzzle agent.
2517160	2518160	Yes.
2518160	2519160	Puzzle agent.
2519160	2525840	Uh, which is actually, um, uh, art style of Graham Annabelle, um, who, uh, does the dank
2525840	2531160	or dunk depending on what mood he's in, uh, comics on the telltalegames.com website and
2531160	2537820	also has a lot of, uh, video shorts and we made a game with really his art style, but
2537820	2545240	new characters of Nelson Tethers, puzzle agent, the single agent of the FBI department of
2545240	2546400	puzzle research.
2546400	2547400	Cool.
2547400	2549080	Uh, they have that.
2549080	2551080	They do now.
2551080	2553080	They do now.
2553080	2556600	Uh, and, uh, it, it was, it was a great game to work on.
2556600	2563120	Uh, it, it was the, the first full-time content programming title that I worked on, um, at
2563120	2566800	Telltale and it's just, it was really fun working with it.
2566800	2568600	It was, I also did some puzzle design.
2568600	2574680	Mine's the second puzzle you show up, a few spruced around in there and the last puzzle.
2574680	2581880	So, uh, I, I won't give away what they are because you should play them, but, uh, no,
2581880	2589520	it's, it's, it's a, it's, it's a puzzle game with a plot and we try to do, made the, make
2589520	2593760	the puzzles, at least the, the critical path ones, uh, relevant to the plot enough.
2593760	2598840	Uh, you know, obviously there's a suspension of disbelief, but try to not do something
2598840	2603080	like, I, I can tell you this key important thing you need to know about the plot, but
2603080	2605200	first, here's a puzzle of matchsticks.
2605200	2613640	Uh, but, um, uh, apparently we're having just, we're having drama.
2613640	2618520	The cat's like, she looked like she wanted to get out and then, and then the moment Rob
2618520	2621800	moved away, she's like, nah, sorry about that.
2621800	2626000	It's quite all right, um, but, uh, no, it's a puzzle of its own that the cat's trying
2626000	2627000	to solve.
2627000	2633280	She's having a whole little puzzle thing down here of her own, so, sorry, but, uh, no, it's,
2633280	2634440	it's a nice little fun game.
2634440	2638280	It's out on platforms, uh, iPhone and PC, right?
2638280	2639600	iPhone, PC and Mac.
2639600	2640600	Oh, okay.
2640600	2641600	And Mac.
2641600	2642600	Yep.
2642600	2643600	Can't forget them.
2643600	2644600	Uh, yeah.
2644600	2645600	Okay.
2645600	2646600	I think I've plugged enough.
2646600	2647600	All right.
2647600	2648600	No, that's no problem.
2648600	2649600	We, we appreciate, uh, you being here.
2649600	2650600	You can plug whatever.
2650600	2653600	Um, I'm not gonna, I don't, I don't even know what you're working on now.
2653600	2655400	You probably couldn't talk about it anyway.
2655400	2659720	Um, but, uh, best of luck with all the upcoming projects over there at Telltale and keep up
2659720	2660720	the good work.
2660720	2665280	Oh, and just saying, there really, really should be an Elvira adventure game.
2665280	2670360	Just so that you haven't heard last week's show, we're just thinking, you know, speaking
2670360	2675600	of celebrities you want to get for the two old Elvira really needs a good, good game
2675600	2676600	treatment.
2676600	2677600	So just something to think about for next Halloween.
2677600	2678600	Okay.
2678600	2679600	Just throwing that out there.
2679600	2680600	Okay.
2680600	2681600	Uh, let's see.
2681600	2683160	I was trying to think what it was.
2683160	2684160	I knew there was a game.
2684160	2685160	Yes.
2685160	2686160	It was the Elvira game.
2686160	2687160	What was it?
2687160	2688160	Was it Golden Girls?
2688160	2689160	No, that wasn't.
2689160	2690160	Well, that too, actually.
2690160	2692320	But that's, that's going to be a little hard to do now.
2692320	2693320	Yeah.
2693320	2695480	You're not going to really be able to get Bea Arthur, but you might be able to get the
2695480	2700680	drag queens that play the Golden Girls in San Francisco around the Thanksgiving season.
2700680	2701680	Forget it.
2701680	2702680	All right.
2702680	2703680	Uh, let's see.
2703680	2704680	My gaming week.
2704680	2708360	I was all excited this week because Alan actually bought me a game and you'll appreciate this.
2708360	2710800	Alan actually bought me a copy of Poker Night.
2710800	2712560	Oh, bless his heart.
2712560	2713560	Yes.
2713560	2716160	He bought me a copy of Poker Night because Steam was having an awesome little pre-order
2716160	2718280	thing on it and he's like, oh Rob, I bought you a game.
2718280	2719280	Let's play the game.
2719280	2721480	And then it's like, oh, the game's not out yet.
2721480	2722480	Yeah.
2722480	2723480	Not quite out yet.
2723480	2725400	But I'll be ready to go.
2725400	2726400	Day one.
2726400	2727400	So thanks for that, Seg.
2727400	2728400	No problem.
2728400	2734440	I had to rash on that at some point, but no, I obviously it's, it's, it's going to be cute.
2734440	2737600	You know, I'm, I'm not, I get, okay, I'll plug Poker Night.
2737600	2738600	Fine.
2738600	2742360	I'm not, I'm not looking for anything like, like my expectations going into this game
2742360	2745820	are not like, I'm, my world is going to be rocked.
2745820	2749200	It's just going to be like, it's going to be a cute poker game with funny characters.
2749200	2754080	Well, we've, we've, we've been telling people like, yes, it's, it's Texas Hold'em Poker
2754080	2762200	with, uh, Tycho, uh, the Heavy from TF2, Max of Salmon Max and Strong Bad.
2762200	2769040	And it has more dialogue than any single episode of a Telltale game.
2769040	2770040	Wow.
2770040	2774880	So, you know, it's not going to be five lines repeated for every single play all the time.
2774880	2778360	Every, you know, there's, there's going to be some variety to it.
2778360	2783240	You know, and it's five bucks, you know, selling those like hotcakes at PAX actually, because
2783240	2784920	we also threw in a poster with it.
2784920	2785920	Nice.
2785920	2787480	I tried for three days to buy it.
2787480	2788960	What, how does that work?
2788960	2791560	My PayPal hasn't ever, hasn't ever gone through, so.
2791560	2792760	Well, now whose fault is that?
2792760	2793760	Not mine.
2793760	2799040	It's Valve's problem, Steam or whatever.
2799040	2801640	But uh, yeah, so Poker Night is, is coming out soon.
2801640	2802640	Yeah.
2802640	2803640	And, uh, they haven't even told me, so.
2803640	2804640	I know, it's all good.
2804640	2805640	So, all right.
2805640	2808640	Well, that's, that's, that's really cool to know there's all that dialogue, because honestly,
2808640	2811200	my expectations going in, I was thinking, okay, this is just going to be like an Xbox
2811200	2815080	Live Arcade style poker game with, you know, characters I recognize.
2815080	2816080	So that's cool.
2816080	2818680	That's, that's, I hope there's a lot of trash talking.
2818680	2821520	That sounds like it could be, could be a part of it with all that dialogue.
2821520	2826320	Mouths are said.
2826320	2828760	Words come out of mouths.
2828760	2834280	There may or may not be playing cards in the game in some shape or fashion in Poker Night.
2834280	2837020	All right, no, all right, all that stuff aside.
2837020	2838020	So I have that to look forward to.
2838020	2841920	I will say a game I did buy on Steam that is out and has been out for a month that I
2841920	2842920	played this week.
2842920	2846080	The listeners should be very proud of me because I don't think WoW was the game I played the
2846080	2850600	most this week, shock and awe, but World of Warcraft was probably actually down there
2850600	2855120	on the ladder this week because I finally got Civilization V on Steam and I've been
2855120	2860480	playing the heck out of Civilization V because it's, um, it's great.
2860480	2865040	It is probably, I haven't decided if I like it more than four yet because I haven't truly
2865040	2868480	got to the end of a game yet because it is so long.
2868480	2870680	Oh my gosh.
2870680	2871680	But it's good.
2871680	2873680	That's a good thing.
2873680	2878320	But I definitely like, it's way better than two or three in my opinion, way, way better
2878320	2880400	than three, that's for sure.
2880400	2881400	But it's great.
2881400	2884680	Um, the hex tile thing is actually one of the things I noticed the least.
2884680	2888520	It's a very fluid transition for the series and a very kind of like logical next step.
2888520	2890680	I really like a lot of the subtle changes they made.
2890680	2895240	I like the fact you can't stack armies on top of each other and just like super army.
2895240	2899840	I kind of like the fact that only one unit can defend a city so you can't have these
2899840	2903480	Uber cities, you know, and just, just kind of like all these, like really, it makes you
2903480	2904680	kind of have to think a different way.
2904680	2909840	I like that they have talent trees that they call social policies basically.
2909840	2911720	That's kind of a neat addition.
2911720	2915920	There's all these cool little things they've added, very customizable games, lots of difficult,
2915920	2917920	lots of difficulty levels, lots of sizes.
2917920	2920120	The city states thing is really neat.
2920120	2922160	I didn't think I would like it at first.
2922160	2928400	A city state is basically a whole new civilization that is only ever one city.
2928400	2930200	They don't aspire to grow.
2930200	2934440	They don't aspire to do anything but exist in their little city state, but they can really
2934440	2938240	make you or break you because if you, if you treat them well, then they give you gifts.
2938240	2943280	They're like, we like you have a rifleman army courtesy of us.
2943280	2945540	Or they might say, you are a jerk.
2945540	2949920	We are going to pay the French to try to kill you, but ultimately they will surrender as
2949920	2951920	they did to me earlier in the week.
2951920	2952920	I got the French to surrender.
2952920	2953920	Big surprise.
2953920	2958120	That's like getting the sun to shine.
2958120	2960360	I just had to work that in there somehow.
2960360	2964820	Not only did I get the French to surrender, but the French gave me Pittsburgh.
2964820	2967680	Really how they had that, or no, sorry, Philadelphia.
2967680	2971240	How they had Philadelphia, I don't know, but I got it now.
2971240	2976120	All of those sandwiches are so French, maybe the bread.
2976120	2981120	It's now a Greek city in my game because of course I'm playing as Alexander the grape.
2981120	2984920	Do you remember Otter Pops when you had Alexander the grape?
2984920	2985920	Yes, I do.
2985920	2986920	I want one.
2986920	2987920	All right.
2987920	2988920	Okay.
2988920	2989920	It's not the show if we don't talk about food.
2989920	2990920	I know.
2990920	2991920	I know.
2991920	2992920	All right.
2992920	2993920	So step five.
2993920	2994920	Awesome.
2994920	2995920	Loving it.
2995920	2996920	I haven't even touched the multiplayer end of it yet because I'm afraid to play against
2996920	2997920	it because they're very good.
2997920	2998920	Yeah, I haven't even done that.
2998920	3000820	But long games.
3000820	3004960	Like I am seriously playing on short mode and I've probably, like the shortest turns
3004960	3008520	there is, and I've probably sunk at least a good three to four hours in this game and
3008520	3009660	it's not done yet.
3009660	3012560	Like I'm just now getting into like having like artilleries.
3012560	3014560	Well, part of the game is-
3014560	3016200	Well, it wasn't my city.
3016200	3017200	Okay.
3017200	3019600	I'm just saying you said the French gave it to you when you were in Greece.
3019600	3021680	It's kind of interesting how that worked out.
3021680	3022680	Okay.
3022680	3024880	I totally forgot what I was going to say.
3024880	3025880	Oh yeah.
3025880	3030520	It's impressive is like you can always save, but it's always that one more turn.
3030520	3031520	Yes.
3031520	3032520	Yes.
3032520	3033520	Oh God.
3033520	3034520	Yes.
3034520	3035520	That's what makes fun because it's always one more turn.
3035520	3038840	I didn't go to bed till one AM the other night because of one more turn.
3038840	3043800	Just one more turn and Paris will be mine.
3043800	3046640	And it was.
3046640	3047640	So just saying.
3047640	3051640	The Fazenator said a junk ferret running around Paris will get France to surrender.
3051640	3053640	By the way, I do want to also acknowledge our chat room.
3053640	3054640	I've been such a bad boy.
3054640	3058120	I haven't acknowledged chat all night long, chat.orangelaundry.com.
3058120	3059120	Please join.
3059120	3060120	They've actually been a little bit quiet tonight.
3060120	3061120	I don't know.
3061120	3062120	Chat room.
3062120	3063120	Rob needs a spanking.
3063120	3064120	Memorized by my voice.
3064120	3065120	Maybe they're...
3065120	3066120	Yes.
3066120	3067120	Maybe they're just...
3067120	3069520	Well, of course, sadly, we don't have a whole lot of people from the Bay Area.
3069520	3073520	So I think we got a lot of people that are kind of like, oh, sounds cool, but plane tickets
3073520	3074520	cost a lot.
3074520	3075520	Yeah.
3075520	3076520	But we do have...
3076520	3079800	I know a lot of podcastees in the Bay, so hopefully we'll see a lot of them at the show.
3079800	3083560	I know I'm going to go come hell or high water, so I'll be there for sure.
3083560	3087760	Well, also, actually, for the...
3087760	3097040	I don't know about other local physical events happening yet for Child's Play, but there's
3097040	3101600	also Desert Bus for Hope, the loading ready run guys.
3101600	3103920	They're starting...
3103920	3104920	I want to say them...
3104920	3105920	Actually, I know.
3105920	3106920	I got it on the calendar.
3106920	3114400	So these are the folks that play Desert Bus as a marathon run for Child's Play charity,
3114400	3120920	and they start November 19th, unless things changed around a bit, but they'll do the live
3120920	3125240	stream and all that on the 19th, which is definitely interesting to watch because, yes,
3125240	3128360	they're playing Desert Bus, but they're also a comedy troupe, so they really make it a
3128360	3131960	telethon show with it.
3131960	3132960	Awesome.
3132960	3135720	I've tuned into a little bit of it before.
3135720	3136720	It's funny.
3136720	3137720	It's funny sometimes.
3137720	3138720	Also...
3138720	3139720	What a crap game to be playing.
3139720	3140720	Hmm?
3140720	3141720	What a crap game to be playing.
3141720	3142720	Yeah.
3142720	3143720	So long.
3143720	3144720	But...
3144720	3145720	That's the joke.
3145720	3146720	Hey, thanks for the money.
3146720	3147720	All right.
3147720	3148720	And also, UmLoud will be streamed live.
3148720	3150640	I forgot about that.
3150640	3157800	So starting at 7 p.m. California time, go to timeanddate.com to figure out what that
3157800	3160040	means for you.
3160040	3165280	The event will be streamed live, so you can actually watch the performances.
3165280	3170000	The UmLoud website will change over to that mode when it's actually happening.
3170000	3174960	And last year, weren't you the most streamed event in the lounge's history or something?
3174960	3175960	Well, no.
3175960	3176960	We killed their internet.
3176960	3177960	Good job.
3177960	3182760	Well, we didn't kill it, but we were the most...
3182760	3188220	The one event that used the internet the most, this being from a venue that is currently
3188220	3194360	owned by one of the co-founders of Netscape, so we're very proud of that, and they actually
3194360	3198440	increased wireless capacity after that.
3198440	3205000	I don't want to say it's because of us, but, you know, feather in our cap.
3205000	3206600	All right.
3206600	3207600	Congratulations on that.
3207600	3208600	Thank you.
3208600	3209600	All right.
3209600	3212400	One more game that I played this week I want to talk about is DJ Hero 2.
3212400	3215760	Even though Loki kind of already talked about that a little bit, I just want to give my
3215760	3219160	spin on it, pun intended.
3219160	3223040	I wasn't going to buy the game originally because I was like, oh, you have 60 bucks.
3223040	3224040	I don't know.
3224040	3228000	I played it in one of those in-store demos, and I was like, okay, I guess I got to buy
3228000	3231000	this because it actually is really fun.
3231000	3236240	They've actually changed a lot about the default interface, and it's not just the vocals that
3236240	3240880	have changed, but now they have freestyle cross-fading, freestyle button pressing that
3240880	3245200	makes a lot more sense than it did in the first game where you had, you know, yeah,
3245200	3247480	boy, over and over again with the button.
3247480	3249200	I love the way they're doing the freestyling now.
3249200	3250200	It's so much better.
3250200	3255480	And the freestyle cross-fades are great, and the scratching zones are really cool, so many
3255480	3260320	more ways to freestyle and really ruin such great songs.
3260320	3262840	I do appreciate all of that they've thrown in the interface.
3262840	3265800	The head-to-head modes are more interesting.
3265800	3267600	I like the interface as a whole.
3267600	3271960	Even though the black and white look is a little bit, like, too plain, I just kind of
3271960	3275840	like the construction of the game a lot more than I did the first mix.
3275840	3282080	So it's a worthy upgrade in the interface and what it brings to the table.
3282080	3283500	I gotta be honest, though.
3283500	3287240	I don't think the song list is as good as the first game, at least the parts I've played
3287240	3288240	so far.
3288240	3290020	There have been a few really good mixes.
3290020	3293120	Like there's this one I can't even get out of my head.
3293120	3296440	It's the one that has Rihanna's Rude Boy in it that I can't get that sample out of my
3296440	3297440	head.
3297440	3298440	I'm a rude boy, boy.
3298440	3299440	I'm a rude...
3299440	3301300	And it's mixed with some other, like, slower R&B song.
3301300	3303480	It's a really good mix.
3303480	3307880	There was some, like, weird ones that I didn't recognize the song.
3307880	3312320	There was one with a Tiesto song that was, like, an R&B song or something mixed with
3312320	3313320	it.
3313320	3316160	It was surprisingly good, actually.
3316160	3319880	I will hopefully play those during the break.
3319880	3320880	I'm attempting...
3320880	3322640	This is like disarming a bomb over here.
3322640	3323640	It's all right.
3323640	3324640	It's all right.
3324640	3325640	If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.
3325640	3326640	No, it's gonna work.
3326640	3327640	I've got the stuff to make it work.
3327640	3328640	It's gonna work!
3328640	3329640	You don't understand, Rob.
3329640	3332640	We're not gonna stop and ask for directions.
3332640	3333640	All right.
3333640	3334640	One more bit of housekeeping.
3334640	3335640	Please.
3335640	3336640	Contest!
3336640	3337640	Yes.
3337640	3339640	Well, I wasn't done with my gaming week, but that's okay.
3339640	3340640	They didn't finish.
3340640	3341640	I got a cookie.
3341640	3345920	I don't know what else to say about DJ Hero 2 that Loki didn't already say.
3345920	3348480	If you like the first game, you're gonna like this game.
3348480	3351520	I'm just a little bit disappointed in the soundtrack.
3351520	3354020	There's some really good songs, though, don't get me wrong, and I think there's something
3354020	3357040	for everyone here, but let me just put it this way.
3357040	3362120	Like, I was threatened with domestic repercussions by my significant other if I played any song
3362120	3367280	that had Soulja Boy in it one more time, so just putting that out there.
3367280	3374960	If you're not a fan of some of these big club hits, you're gonna be in for a world of pain,
3374960	3375960	so that's it.
3375960	3376960	All right.
3376960	3378320	Now we can get to housekeeping.
3378320	3379320	Join our Facebook.
3379320	3380520	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
3380520	3381520	Join our Twitter.
3381520	3383040	Twitter.com slash OLR.
3383040	3384440	Dark Soccer has a contest.
3384440	3385440	Okay.
3385440	3390400	This is our contest, and the prize is going to be a code for Xbox Live to play Castlevania
3390400	3395840	Symphony of the Night, which is a fun game, one of my favorites.
3395840	3403120	The question is really easy, and we are going to be taking an emailer at a random number,
3403120	3409220	which we will decide by literally rolling a die on the show.
3409220	3415440	This is in relation to Comic Insanity, which is the other podcast that I do, and we broadcast
3415440	3425240	every... We're actually up on Infamous, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net on Mondays is when the new podcast is up.
3425240	3431480	The question you have to answer is what is the name of he who shall not be named on Comic
3431480	3432480	Insanity?
3432480	3435200	I'll give you a clue.
3435200	3438200	We hate him.
3438200	3439480	That so narrows it down.
3439480	3440480	Wow.
3440480	3441480	That could be anybody.
3441480	3443380	It's me.
3443380	3451520	Then you can send your emails to... I guess go ahead and send it to the mailbag here.
3451520	3452520	I'll check it.
3452520	3454760	Mailbag at OrangeDownsRadio.com.
3454760	3459640	I will sift through it, and we will roll a number at random, and I'll pick a name.
3459640	3460640	Awesome.
3460640	3461640	Now the other contest.
3461640	3462640	More?
3462640	3465480	Which isn't us, but a lot of people would be interested in this.
3465480	3472120	Also at Infamous.net, there is a contest to win a bunch of Blizzard goodies from Blizzcon.
3472120	3474620	If you missed it, there's stuff for you.
3474620	3481880	There are free pets, Cataclysm stuff.
3481880	3492480	There's also a demo of Starcraft 2, and a few Starcraft 2 lithos, and some goodies.
3492480	3493480	Lots of goodies.
3493480	3494480	Lots of stuff.
3494480	3495480	What do I have to do?
3495480	3496480	Just send it a name?
3496480	3502100	You have to go to Infamous.net and click on the contest link, and it's, again, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net
3502100	3505520	... and click on the Blizzard contest.
3505520	3506520	Follow the directions.
3506520	3509440	You just basically have to fill out your information, let them know what you're looking most forward
3509440	3513320	to for Cataclysm, which, you know what my response was?
3513320	3514320	Nothing.
3514320	3520280	Except maybe Plants vs. Zombies, but I don't play World of Warcraft, so, meh.
3520280	3522520	You've been tempted to go back a couple times, though.
3522520	3523520	I have been.
3523520	3524520	Don't make me go find the time stamps.
3524520	3527440	Well, just because Tiara told me that leveling is faster now.
3527440	3528440	It is.
3528440	3529440	And in Cataclysm, it's going to be even better.
3529440	3533240	I hated leveling in freakin' World of Warcraft, so...
3533240	3534240	Boo hoo.
3534240	3535240	Alright.
3535240	3536240	I'm just messing.
3536240	3540640	Star Trek Online is much more fun, because I can kill Borg and play with Klingons.
3540640	3541920	How's that working out for you?
3541920	3543160	Stupid fuckin' Borg.
3543160	3544160	Alright.
3544160	3545160	Anyhow.
3545160	3546160	I hate you, Borg.
3546160	3547160	You know what's funny?
3547160	3549440	I was on TV today, and I had to let my son watch it.
3549440	3550760	Wrath of Khan in HD.
3550760	3556680	I was like, well, Josh, this is the best Star Trek movie ever, so you better watch.
3556680	3559960	Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but that's not, that's not to say he was bored.
3559960	3560960	He just...
3560960	3561960	He's tired.
3561960	3562960	Well, baby, sleep.
3562960	3563960	Have you taken him to the theater yet?
3563960	3565840	Make sure that you take him to an epic movie in the theater when he's still an infant,
3565840	3567560	so that can be his first movie.
3567560	3568560	Definitely.
3568560	3570240	Mine was Star Wars.
3570240	3571720	Good stuff.
3571720	3572720	Yep.
3572720	3573720	Alright.
3573720	3575000	Well, this might be a new record, guys.
3575000	3577520	We're an hour into the show, and we have yet to touch gaming news.
3577520	3578520	Woo hoo!
3578520	3579520	Woo hoo!
3579520	3581240	That's alright, so we're gonna kinda quickly move through some gaming news tonight.
3581240	3583400	Uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?
3583400	3587440	Some gaming news, if you can get away through the MacGyver stuff for a moment, I don't know.
3587440	3589440	I got the work, by the way.
3589440	3590440	Um, of course.
3590440	3592160	I am awesome like that.
3592160	3598320	Xbox.com has gotten a makeover to kind of update everything, you know, with the new
3598320	3600960	dashboard updates coming soon and whatnot.
3600960	3606560	They've added avatar editors on the actual website, so now you don't have to wait till
3606560	3610240	you get to your console to make your avatar look neat.
3610240	3617440	Um, then also, apparently, they're gonna add some multiplayer web games, which, um, that's
3617440	3618440	cool, I guess.
3618440	3624680	I don't know if it's gonna be some more stuff that you can, um, do for, like, eh, if it's
3624680	3627280	gonna tie in with different games, you know, like how they did with Crackdown and Facebook
3627280	3631240	games and stuff, um, perhaps, but, uh, right now they're saying that they're gonna be able
3631240	3638660	to play web games with your Xbox Live friends on the web or on Windows Phone 7, and, um,
3638660	3640400	I'm sure those will be fun.
3640400	3641400	Yeah.
3641400	3647240	Uh, and this is all, of course, uh, this already came out this week, and, um, so go check it
3647240	3648240	out.
3648240	3651640	Are any of those free games available yet?
3651640	3653080	The web stuff, or?
3653080	3654320	They were just teasing them.
3654320	3655320	Yeah.
3655320	3658480	They haven't really made them available yet, but the avatar editor's there, so you can
3658480	3659680	check that out at least.
3659680	3661120	They'll be coming out soon.
3661120	3665100	Um, yeah, I'm glad that they actually updated the website, because there was a lot of stuff
3665100	3670200	that was broken on there, like, you know, links to games and stuff, you're, okay, I
3670200	3673840	wanna look up stuff about Crackdown 2, okay, that page doesn't exist.
3673840	3677040	Well, when was the last time they changed that, that, the look of the page?
3677040	3678360	I think it was even before the-
3678360	3679960	The new Xbox experience.
3679960	3684200	I think it was before the Xbox 360's launch, I mean-
3684200	3685200	Yeah.
3685200	3686200	No, I wanna say they had a change.
3686200	3687200	I wanna say they did change it with MXC.
3687200	3688200	No, I think they did update it with the 360.
3688200	3689200	Yeah.
3689200	3695440	I mean, it seems that they're doing this, this was more of, in line with the Windows
3695440	3699560	phone, and all that, and they're trying to-
3699560	3700760	Yeah, they're really pushing this-
3700760	3705400	They're really pushing the phone, because, you know, let's face it, they're a competitor.
3705400	3706400	Yeah.
3706400	3709840	Well, and let's also not forget that, you know, there's some stories this week about
3709840	3715000	how AT&T is really starting to get behind these phones, because the rumors are starting
3715000	3720200	to snowball a little more that they are going Verizon with the iPhone in 2011.
3720200	3726160	And so AT&T is actually going to start pushing a lot more the Windows phone, I mean, not
3726160	3729720	to say they're not gonna sell the iPhone anymore, but they're gonna also be pushing the Windows
3729720	3730720	phones-
3730720	3731720	Diversify the portfolio.
3731720	3732720	Exactly, exactly.
3732720	3737720	So, it'll be interesting to see if there's any truth to these so-called rumors.
3737720	3747960	The thing I will say about this with the Xbox.com site that I wish Sony would do, is when you
3747960	3755240	hear about a game that's available as a downloadable service, at least with Xbox, you can, if you're
3755240	3759240	at work and you hear about it, you can buy it on the site, and you don't have to be at
3759240	3763840	your Xbox, and you can make that purchase or say, okay, I want the demo.
3763840	3768960	So then, when you get back to your Xbox, it'll be downloaded, waiting for you, and remind
3768960	3772760	you that you wanted to look at the thing and play it.
3772760	3776160	There's also just a lot more content on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
3776160	3780880	There's always at least a couple games coming out each week, versus Sony, there may be a
3780880	3782440	game coming out that week.
3782440	3784360	It's not consistent.
3784360	3785360	Unless you count-
3785360	3786360	No, it's being consistent.
3786360	3787360	It's-
3787360	3791980	Unless you count their old PlayStation 1 classics that they're putting out.
3791980	3796880	I mean, they could, really, for the both of them, they need to make, well, Xbox needs
3796880	3801120	to make their indie game service or whatever, community games, however the fuck they're
3801120	3806320	calling it now, they need to make it more like the App Store, where it's not just games,
3806320	3810160	it's applications and stuff, and make it more, instead of just, oh, kind of, we're putting
3810160	3813480	this in the back corner of our Marketplace, make it more-
3813480	3814480	Showcased.
3814480	3821960	Yes, exactly, because with the App Store, it's easy to spend money like crazy on a
3821960	3825840	thing, and if they made it more like that, and had like, okay, hey, look, this feature
3825840	3832240	now has, you know, weather updates, and this app does, you know, this and this, you know,
3832240	3837920	I think that would be beneficial for them, especially since they don't have a web browser.
3837920	3842160	All right, well, I will say, though, one thing about the website, one thing I tried to look
3842160	3849160	up was the Game Room website, yeah, I wasn't there, I had to do a search for it, something
3849160	3853640	not pretty is going on with Game Room, I'm sorry to say, but we'll see, just to kind
3853640	3855240	of follow up a little bit from last week.
3855240	3858920	Let me move on with some of the other big, big news this week, of course, something that
3858920	3861600	was on a lot of people's minds, and this is really one of those, like, either you were
3861600	3866080	watching every second of it, or you just kind of didn't care, BlizzCon was going on this
3866080	3867080	weekend.
3867080	3872560	Surprisingly, though, not quite the amount of information I think folks were expecting
3872560	3873880	out of BlizzCon this year.
3873880	3878560	Yes, there were some announcements, there were a few things, Diablo 3 seemed to be the
3878560	3883000	most announcements, which wasn't a huge surprise to anyone, really, because we all know that
3883000	3885080	Blizzard is pushing Diablo 3.
3885080	3890640	Diablo 3's latest class, the Demon Hunter, is revealed, and that is supposedly the last
3890640	3892160	class that's going to be in the game.
3892160	3897520	Also, PvP Battle Arenas, that does sound kind of cool, that is also coming to Diablo 3.
3897520	3898880	Those are some of the big announcements.
3898880	3901640	One thing that was missing, though, was when?
3901640	3907760	Not even a hint of a quarter or a year, really, for Diablo 3, so we're all left to just speculate
3907760	3911840	as to the release date, otherwise it's pretty much just soon.
3911840	3915120	On the World of Warcraft front, there really wasn't a lot to say.
3915120	3917020	Cataclysm is coming out on December 7th.
3917020	3921520	One of the things they confirmed is that they are going to be doing digital distribution
3921520	3922520	day one.
3922520	3928480	You will be able to download Cataclysm and play the minute it launches, which some might
3928480	3933800	see as kind of a kick in the gut to some of the Game Stops and Best Buys of the world.
3933800	3937200	Of course, you won't be able to get the Collector's Edition online.
3937200	3940080	Maybe this is just a way for Blizzard to get people to buy both.
3940080	3942280	I don't know, because I do know people that will buy both.
3942280	3946200	They will buy this just so they can be there minute one, and then they'll go buy the Collector's
3946200	3947920	Edition, because they are suckers.
3947920	3948920	Addicts!
3948920	3949920	Yes, and addicts.
3949920	3950920	Buy more stuff.
3950920	3953960	I love them, but they're addicts and suckers.
3953960	3954960	Alright.
3954960	3959800	Also, the Moonkin Hatchling is going to be the next World of Warcraft pet that is sold
3959800	3960800	in the store.
3960800	3962040	The rumor is it's another charity pet.
3962040	3965240	I really couldn't get clear one way or the other if it's a charity pet or not, but they
3965240	3968040	have confirmed that that is coming to the store.
3968040	3971120	Starcraft 2 is going to be getting some scenarios for it.
3971120	3976280	One of them is a Defense of the Ancients scenario, also Bejeweled and Left 4 Dead, some other
3976280	3980560	interesting little kind of like versions of those in Starcraft 2.
3980560	3983360	But I find the Defense of the Ancients one of the most interesting, because Valve, of
3983360	3985560	course, has their Defense of the Ancients game.
3985560	3989600	They actually got the people who originally did the mod now work at Valve, but yet Blizzard
3989600	3990920	is now going to make their own.
3990920	3992040	It's very interesting.
3992040	3995580	So you're going to have Starcraft, or what they're calling Blizzard Defense of the Ancients,
3995580	3998600	is going to be coming to Starcraft 2 soon.
3998600	4001280	Again, no date there.
4001280	4002900	So yep, folks went to BlizzCon.
4002900	4004800	Some guy broke his leg while dancing.
4004800	4006400	Tenacious D played.
4006400	4007840	People spent 150 bucks.
4007840	4009480	Hope you guys found it worth it.
4009480	4012360	I really don't have any interest.
4012360	4015160	As much as I'm an addict of War Program, I have no interest in BlizzCon.
4015160	4016160	You know what?
4016160	4017800	It's also $150.
4017800	4019080	What's that, Seg?
4019080	4023720	Ultimate Band Package for Umcloud on sale on November 1st.
4023720	4025320	And I tell you, that's probably more exciting.
4025320	4027320	That's probably a better deal.
4027320	4031760	Honestly, you guys, maybe you can't say this year, are you guys doing the swag bag again
4031760	4032920	for the Ultimate Bands this year?
4032920	4037360	Oh yeah, I mean we don't know what's going to be in it, but we're going to do a bag.
4037360	4040320	You're probably going to get better shit in those bags than you do in the BlizzCon bags.
4040320	4041320	I think the BlizzCon bags...
4041320	4044560	I can say that too, you'll get better stuff.
4044560	4046400	Did they even get a pet this year in the BlizzCon bags?
4046400	4049480	Yeah, they got another, it was another Murloc, I think.
4049480	4050480	It was...
4050480	4051480	That, yeah.
4051480	4052480	That's it.
4052480	4054200	It was a Deathwing Murloc, I think.
4054200	4055200	So many.
4055200	4056200	Was that correct?
4056200	4057200	That's part of the giveaway.
4057200	4058200	There's so many.
4058200	4062920	They can go win one off Infamous Gamers and don't spend $150 to get a swag bag.
4062920	4068640	I actually looked at the live blog for it, and I was like, so they announced a new class
4068640	4072240	for Diablo, and that was it?
4072240	4078500	I wonder if they didn't originally intend to announce the date for Cataclysm, but they
4078500	4084640	got beaten to it by an inadvertent leak, because they were able to deduce, MMO-Champion deduced
4084640	4088320	the release date of the game by things that were delivered in one of the patches.
4088320	4091600	I'm not going to get into all the specifics, I don't want to bore the non-WOW players.
4091600	4092600	But basically...
4092600	4096000	There was some update that was supposed to happen a week after the Cataclysm event came
4096000	4098360	out, and they dated that update, so...
4098360	4099360	Yes.
4099360	4100360	Exactly.
4100360	4104560	And we have deduced that it is December 7th.
4104560	4111920	So anyhow, that's what went on at BlizzCon, otherwise you had angry gamers asking questions
4111920	4117120	and raging in the microphone at Blizz developers, because everybody's so mature, so that's all
4117120	4118880	the stuff you missed.
4118880	4123800	I tried to get people on Twitter to, I'm like, if you're going to rage question, then at
4123800	4125880	least rage question about real ID.
4125880	4134720	Do something that actually affects your real life, instead of like, stop nerfing my paladin!
4134720	4139680	But I will say, if I may, since I am a Warcraft player and I'm teasing myself here a little
4139680	4140680	bit.
4140680	4141680	You may.
4141680	4145260	That new patch that Blizzard did, although I really like some of the features and some
4145260	4149680	of the changes they did, boy did they screw some things up.
4149680	4154840	Like they have this bug in there right now, where like an icon turning into a certain
4154840	4157040	shape will crash the entire game.
4157040	4158560	It's called the cogwheel bug.
4158560	4162000	And what's great about it is that for the Halloween event, in order to summon the Halloween
4162000	4168420	boss, you gotta click the cogwheel on the Headless Horseman thing, the pumpkin, so pretty
4168420	4170040	much everybody crashes out.
4170040	4176600	They've been able to fix it with a third party fix that's available on Curse, but yeah, Blizzard's
4176600	4180660	too busy throwing their party to really be on top of that right now.
4180660	4181660	So whatever.
4181660	4184440	Maybe I won't go back and play it.
4184440	4189840	This new patch needed a little more testing, but Blizzard really wanted that game out this
4189840	4190840	year so whatever.
4190840	4195000	At least it's not as much of a hot mess as another certain MMO that came out and they
4195000	4198760	had to extend the trial period of the game because it was so terrible.
4198760	4200880	But anyhow, I'm not gonna go there again for another week.
4200880	4201880	Alright.
4201880	4202880	You don't understand, Rob.
4202880	4205640	It still is the trial part of the game.
4205640	4209120	It will be the trial part of the game for the next few years.
4209120	4212700	All I have to say is some of my friends who I was really close with in the game before
4212700	4218440	that have apparently gone into this new game and have said, oh wow, it's bad.
4218440	4221180	Like it is really, really bad.
4221180	4223480	Like I'll stick with Final Fantasy 11.
4223480	4226160	Pretty well, yes.
4226160	4228040	I was trying to be nice and not name names.
4228040	4229600	Final Fantasy 14, that's right.
4229600	4230600	That's the game that sucks.
4230600	4232600	Final Fantasy 14 is fucking terrible, ahhh!
4232600	4233600	It's terrible.
4233600	4234600	I can't hold it in anymore.
4234600	4235600	It blows.
4235600	4236840	It's a brand new game.
4236840	4242000	We have the same races, but we need them something more ridiculous and it sucks worse.
4242000	4246920	Although I do remember one MMO that I played that was in beta for like seven years.
4246920	4247920	Ragnarok.
4247920	4249560	Ragnarok.
4249560	4254000	And I played through the whole thing in several different languages.
4254000	4256760	They better not hear you talking smack on our show or we ban you.
4256760	4257760	I love Ragnarok.
4257760	4258760	Permanently.
4258760	4259760	You know, this must be...
4259760	4264040	My account can't be banned on Ragnarok, even though I don't play anymore on the IRO server.
4264040	4265040	Who'd you blow?
4265040	4266880	Because I was a beta tester.
4266880	4273800	All the beta accounts that played for the PVP testing got to keep their accounts.
4273800	4274800	It's good to know.
4274800	4275800	Yeah.
4275800	4276800	Alright.
4276800	4280960	It must be a key to my personality, but the only MMO I've actually played with some length
4280960	4283680	was Myst Online.
4283680	4285480	Myst Online was kind of creepy.
4285480	4291760	Myst Online was a great idea, and man, Zombie Game refused to die.
4291760	4296000	I mean, that game got relaunched about four times.
4296000	4297000	And it was great.
4297000	4300480	It just needed...
4300480	4307360	There were just things that hung it up on interface-wise.
4307360	4308960	And narrative-based MMO.
4308960	4310920	That's a huge beast to fill.
4310920	4312340	Let's see.
4312340	4315640	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com.
4315640	4320000	Tigerclaw says, talking about Blizzcon, one fan complained about the WoW characters looking
4320000	4322880	like they came from Victoria's Secrets.
4322880	4326280	The developer replied, what magazine do you want them to look like?
4326280	4327280	Penthouse!
4327280	4332880	Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat says, all the WoW players moved on to a better game.
4332880	4335040	Hello Kitty Island Adventures.
4335040	4336040	You know what's funny?
4336040	4338680	Is that we were at Target the other day, and there was Final Fantasy XIV sitting on the
4338680	4340360	shelf, and Alan's like, you should buy that.
4340360	4341400	He's like, hey, hey, you should buy that.
4341400	4342400	You should buy that.
4342400	4345920	I'm like, I will buy this before I buy that, and I pointed at Hello Kitty Online.
4345920	4351000	You know that Hello Kitty is getting her first Wii game coming in November.
4351000	4352000	No one curr.
4352000	4353000	Alright.
4353000	4354000	What?
4354000	4356000	You're not a fan.
4356000	4361720	I remember me picking up a certain Batsmaru Hello Kitty game, and Rob going, oh girl,
4361720	4364120	I want to play that!
4364120	4365320	And me lending it to him.
4365320	4367880	Says the person that has the Hello Kitty toaster.
4367880	4368880	I deny these allegations.
4368880	4369880	And Coffee Baker.
4369880	4370880	All of them.
4370880	4371880	I actually, I actually got.
4371880	4372880	And a Hello Kitty TV.
4372880	4373880	Hold on.
4373880	4376400	Actually, it was a Disney Princess TV for one.
4376400	4377400	Oh, I'm sorry.
4377400	4378400	That's much better.
4378400	4385640	I gave it to a seven-year-old girl, and the Hello Kitty Coffee Maker is no more.
4385640	4386640	It's gone.
4386640	4387960	I got a real Coffee Maker.
4387960	4388960	Yeah, I know.
4388960	4389960	Alright, anyhow.
4389960	4391280	You know what, Rob?
4391280	4396240	If you really want to be cool, you'll just get a French press.
4396240	4398240	Rob blinks.
4398240	4399680	Moving on with more gaming news.
4399680	4401680	Someone's phone farted.
4401680	4407240	Well, this is a lot more cool than, a lot cooler than World of Warcraft, as I mess up
4407240	4410520	my adjectives.
4410520	4414840	Space Channel 5 Part 2, yes, the one with the full-on thriller Dance with Space Michael
4414840	4420400	and apparently Ulala grabbing her crotch, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation
4420400	4424520	Network, along with Sega Bass Fishing.
4424520	4431400	We will see them in early 2011, and the good thing about Space Channel 5 Part 2 is that
4431400	4434000	we never got it in North America, so this means we get to play it.
4434000	4437360	Like, there's really a whole bunch of Japanese in it to change.
4437360	4438360	I mean...
4438360	4441440	Didn't we get, we got it on PlayStation 2 version, didn't we?
4441440	4442680	Yeah, I think so.
4442680	4443680	I don't know.
4443680	4445400	I've got the Japanese one.
4445400	4448440	With that freaking hard one where it does all the stuff and you have to do it backwards?
4448440	4450440	Oh my god.
4450440	4453800	Anyway, so yeah, but it's a Mizuguchi game.
4453800	4454800	It's really fun.
4454800	4460760	Space Channel 5, really, really like it, and I love Space Channel 5 Part 2, mainly because
4460760	4465160	of the thriller dance, the whole section where they do just Michael Jackson dances.
4465160	4468160	And Pudding is especially fierce in Part 2.
4468160	4471240	I'm Pudding.
4471240	4472760	She's my favorite, just for the record.
4472760	4473800	Pudding is my favorite character.
4473800	4476360	And Shermie has left the studio.
4476360	4478680	You notice she did not step on your laptop?
4478680	4479680	She's good that way.
4479680	4480680	Good kitty.
4480680	4481680	Yeah.
4481680	4482680	Alright.
4482680	4484620	Crushed his laptop.
4484620	4490160	She is not that huge, and she knows better than to step on laptops because we got onto
4490160	4491160	her.
4491160	4492160	She'll get a kitty spanking.
4492160	4493160	Alright, moving on.
4493160	4494160	She likes it.
4494160	4495160	More gaming news.
4495160	4497800	Shermie does like spankings, by the way.
4497800	4498800	We don't need to know that.
4498800	4499800	She puts her butt-
4499800	4500800	It's her family show!
4500800	4501800	You're not her family show.
4501800	4502800	No, for real.
4502800	4503800	Like, if you-
4503800	4504800	Fuck family shows!
4504800	4508800	If you pet her on her lower back, she'll stick her butt up in the air and start purring.
4508800	4511240	I don't need to know what your cat's into.
4511240	4513600	Does your cat want a leather harness for Christmas?
4513600	4515640	No, she's not into that.
4515640	4517720	I'm sorry, your Hanukkah?
4517720	4519320	My cat's not Jewish.
4519320	4521320	She's agnostic.
4521320	4522720	Okay.
4522720	4530600	Apparently, there was a re- or, Ubisoft is recalling Shaun White's skateboarding on the
4530600	4536460	PlayStation 3, which means I'm gonna have a lot of fuckin' work to do tomorrow because
4536460	4540160	they've already shipped them all to us so that we got them to our customers, so we're
4540160	4542240	gonna have to do a bunch of fuckin' returns on it.
4542240	4547380	But apparently, and this was coming from some big name retailers, they're saying that there
4547380	4557320	is issues with quality of the game, apparently, according to Sony, it says there was a manufacturing
4557320	4562200	issue with misprinted disc at Sony Computer Entertainment America, and the wrong version
4562200	4567040	of Shaun White's skateboarding PS3 was shipped to retailers.
4567040	4569600	We were working with Ubisoft to correct the issue.
4569600	4574800	New PS3 copies will be shipped to North American retailers by Thursday, October 28th, and it
4574800	4578320	will be available by that weekend.
4578320	4579320	Thanks.
4579320	4584080	Thanks for all the work, you fuckin' dumbasses.
4584080	4587720	Duh, we printed it wrong!
4587720	4592120	Well, now Loki mistakes happen.
4592120	4593120	Yeah.
4593120	4594120	Whatever.
4594120	4596600	You just don't like having the work.
4596600	4600280	Was there some Arab song in this that someone got offended about, you know, playing the
4600280	4603000	beta or something, like LittleBigPlanet?
4603000	4606520	I did get one of those copies, and really, it was stupid.
4606520	4610800	I liked it better with the lyrics in the game.
4610800	4614920	I think Shaun White's skateboarding is intentionally supposed to be that bad, so that's a feature.
4614920	4616840	Is this a big title, or is this...
4616840	4617840	No.
4617840	4619340	I'm like, how many people buy this game?
4619340	4621160	Most people are like, Shaun White?
4621160	4622640	Who the fuck's he?
4622640	4624200	Isn't that the snowboarder?
4624200	4626200	Isn't that the guy that looks like Carrot Top?
4626200	4628440	Yes, it is the guy that looks like Carrot Top.
4628440	4629440	He actually sk-
4629440	4630440	I know who it is!
4630440	4632920	He actually skateboards, but Tony Hawk has a game coming out, you know, Tony Hawk's
4632920	4637920	charrette, and as far as I'm aware, Tony Hawk does not fucking snowboard, so...
4637920	4638920	He's a poser.
4638920	4639920	No.
4639920	4640920	I don't know.
4640920	4641920	That game is terrible.
4641920	4642920	Not the Shaun White game.
4642920	4645400	Shaun White game is decent, but Tony Hawk's terrible.
4645400	4648920	Well if Shaquille O'Neal can do everything, like, you know, he had that whole TV show
4648920	4652680	about Shaquille O'Neal does this and that, then, you know, why can't Tony Hawk decide
4652680	4653680	to-
4653680	4655600	And they're doing comic-style art of him.
4655600	4656920	Shaquille O'Neal?
4656920	4659840	And, cause, with the new, uh, Celtics lineup.
4659840	4665760	We, but, you can listen to Infamous, uh,.NET's, uh, Comic Insanity for that.
4665760	4666760	Plug plug.
4666760	4671920	Uh, Salacious Pop is bringing us some LOLs in chat, um, has anyone actually seen Shaun
4671920	4672920	White?
4672920	4676160	What he needs is a line of shampoo and hair care, not video games.
4676160	4680760	Uh, also, Salacious Pop, uh, mentioning Shermie, was, uh, walking out, and Salacious Pop was
4680760	4685120	suggesting, um, uh, talk about the Sony move so she'll poop in the hall.
4685120	4689720	She does that, every time we bring it up, she goes out in the hall and takes a big crap.
4689720	4694320	I've got something better, um, I, uh, noticed when I was in the Sony Marketplace this weekend
4694320	4697920	that there is a preview download for, is Shermie listening?
4697920	4702120	Shermie, the tester season 2 has a preview trailer available.
4702120	4706520	Do not get my cat to take a crap, because guess who has to clean that shit up?
4706520	4707520	Me!
4707520	4708520	Literally.
4708520	4712140	Just say, the tester season 2, Shermie.
4712140	4717120	And again, disclaimer, my cat is old and fat and can't get to the bathroom easily.
4717120	4721520	She's fat and sassy.
4721520	4725080	Let's talk about something else that's going to be very sassy, at least for, uh, fans of
4725080	4726080	these series.
4726080	4727080	As long as it doesn't involve cat shit.
4727080	4728080	No, it doesn't involve that.
4728080	4732800	Uh, Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright are going to be colliding.
4732800	4736140	Worlds are colliding in a new 3DS adventure.
4736140	4740400	What I love about this is that these are, like, two very culty kind of games on the
4740400	4741400	DS.
4741400	4744640	Like, either you play them and you love them, or you're like, what is this, I don't even
4744640	4745640	know.
4745640	4751920	So, somehow, and I, of course I'm looking at this going, how does this even work?
4751920	4754680	How do these two games even, alright, whatever.
4754680	4756080	Did you watch the trailer?
4756080	4757920	I didn't, to be honest.
4757920	4760680	Oh, no, the Japanese trailer is out.
4760680	4764720	Yeah, there's actually a good high res one out, though.
4764720	4765720	Oh, is there?
4765720	4766720	Yeah.
4766720	4768940	Um, but it was really cool.
4768940	4773200	I sat and watched the whole thing going, haha, I can only understand half of this.
4773200	4775600	Well, and it's going to be on the 3DS, and that's kind of awesome.
4775600	4778040	That's the noise you hear in the background, by the way, is a little bit of the trailer,
4778040	4780920	but that's like somebody filming an actual screen there.
4780920	4787640	But anyhow, this is one of the four surprise titles that Level 5 has been working on.
4787640	4793660	They are doing this whole, it's a combination of puzzles and crime mystery.
4793660	4797360	You know, I guess that could kind of make sense.
4797360	4800040	Are they biting a little bit from the other puzzle game?
4800040	4804720	This is the FBI, the whole FBI investigation, this is starting to sound a little familiar.
4804720	4808600	Say, guys, you might want to look into exploring a lawsuit on this, I don't know.
4808600	4813040	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm just starting crap.
4813040	4816440	You know, I mean, I'm excited for it.
4816440	4822360	You know, I mean, it's the kind of thing of like, this can go horribly, horribly wrong,
4822360	4825640	but there's a chance that it can go horribly, horribly right.
4825640	4827640	But it'll be in 3D!
4827640	4835640	Well, no, but seriously, though, I wait in eager anticipation to what this turns out.
4835640	4841200	I haven't read up on it or anything, I don't think they even published much to anything,
4841200	4848920	and it's probably in Japanese, and I'm a Gaijin, that's the right word, right?
4848920	4853580	If you were in Japan, then yeah, you'd be Gaijin, but no, it's great, it starts off
4853580	4859240	with someone being interviewed in court, and then you see the professor there, he's like,
4859240	4863120	oh, talking, talking, and all of a sudden, this finger pops up, and this guy comes out
4863120	4865960	of the shadows and goes, subscribe mas!
4865960	4866960	As in, objection.
4866960	4867960	Objection!
4867960	4869800	That means you're wrong.
4869800	4876640	I love this way it's described here by Level 5 president Akihiro Hino, quote, two TV shows
4876640	4879100	getting together and making a movie.
4879100	4881560	So it's like Facts of Life meets Golden Girls, basically.
4881560	4885640	There's got to be tons of cinematics from what they should, the trailer was long.
4885640	4887520	I mean, really long.
4887520	4891560	Well, I bet that's going to be pretty awesome, actually, so.
4891560	4892560	Very cool.
4892560	4895400	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get into release dates?
4895400	4898240	Something that's even better than Sonic 4.
4898240	4902080	And you know how we feel about Sonic 4.
4902080	4907200	I mean, aw, okay.
4907200	4911740	There are a group of Sonic fans, actually two people, that brought out something called
4911740	4916920	Sonic Fan Remix that is actually absolutely gorgeous.
4916920	4922300	I played it before the show, and didn't you think it was?
4922300	4923300	It was pretty.
4923300	4924300	It was pretty.
4924300	4925300	Very pretty.
4925300	4928760	It's got different mechanics from different Sonic games thrown in, except for the Dash
4928760	4929760	thing.
4929760	4931200	It looks gorgeous.
4931200	4935920	I really think that, now one thing that I did notice when reading up on this is that
4935920	4942520	they actually brought in tons of elements from Sonic CD, which that's really how it
4942520	4947880	felt to me, playing, like it is playing Sonic CD.
4947880	4952680	But they're doing so much of a better job than what Sega is doing, I mean, Sega should
4952680	4956240	just be like, hey, we like you.
4956240	4960920	But the people that are doing it is Pelican 13 and Mercury.
4960920	4963960	The demo is out to download.
4963960	4967720	You can go to Sonic Retro and find it.
4967720	4972840	They also do have a direct, let me get the link for it real quick, because there actually
4972840	4975840	is a direct...
4975840	4978560	There's some comments from our chat about this from some people that have played it.
4978560	4982840	Burr is in our chat room and says, my only criticism of Sonic Fan Remix is the backgrounds
4982840	4985400	are so busy it can be hard to see.
4985400	4987600	That's the problem that I had with it, too.
4987600	4991280	I mean, really, that was the one problem I had with it.
4991280	4997200	Okay, the website is just SonicFanRemix.com, all one word except for the dot com, which
4997200	4998400	is a dot and a comma.
4998400	5000560	All right, how long until Sega files a lawsuit?
5000560	5002080	Anyone, anyone, anyone?
5002080	5003080	Anyone?
5003080	5004080	Sega should be embarrassed.
5004080	5006920	And then they'll file a lawsuit.
5006920	5011800	No, seriously, Rob, bring up the trailer, play some of the music, because the music
5011800	5012800	is gorgeous.
5012800	5013800	Sure.
5013800	5014800	Let me bring that up here from the website.
5014800	5016800	What did you think?
5016800	5021760	Yeah, my only, you know, I didn't, I was just looking over your shoulder for it, but definitely
5021760	5027120	the backgrounds are sort of like, too busy and it kind of illustrates how they're really
5027120	5032560	going to 11 with the art, like, hey, look what we're doing, and gets a little too, just
5032560	5034600	on the edge of showboaty with it.
5034600	5035600	Yeah.
5035600	5038840	But not stupid.
5038840	5040840	It's noticeable, but it's not stupid.
5040840	5045360	It's not completely detrimental to the game itself.
5045360	5051760	I think it'd be something to get used to.
5051760	5053080	Very pretty looking.
5053080	5056400	I love some of the like interactive backgrounds, even though, yeah, the multi-layered background
5056400	5059360	thing can get a little busy, but it kind of detracts.
5059360	5061880	I really love some of what they did with it.
5061880	5062880	Looks hot.
5062880	5066920	I like it when it gets into my favorite part of this music.
5066920	5067920	Kudos.
5067920	5068920	Oh, which was next?
5068920	5069920	Oh, I'm sorry.
5069920	5070920	There you go.
5070920	5071920	There you go.
5071920	5072920	Yeah.
5072920	5073920	All right.
5073920	5078240	I love that, that little like shark thing that jumps out as he's running over the bridge.
5078240	5079600	It's like a big killer whale, I think.
5079600	5081920	Little touches like that are awesome.
5081920	5086160	And it even knocks, the blocks are all that same checkerboard pattern all around it.
5086160	5087160	It's pretty fantastic.
5087160	5093680	I'd have to say that this is an epic job and I hope it doesn't get shut down the way that
5093680	5096160	the Chrono Trigger thing was, because that was also awesome.
5096160	5098520	Well, Burr apparently has been following this pretty closely.
5098520	5102000	He has a follow-up comment here in our chat room at chat.orangewise.com.
5102000	5105920	The people on the forums about it say Sega won't do anything about it.
5105920	5107880	Not sure why they're so confident.
5107880	5108880	Hmm.
5108880	5109880	Interesting.
5109880	5110880	All right.
5110880	5112560	Well, definitely worth checking out.
5112560	5114960	Grab it now until it becomes a problem.
5114960	5115960	That's my suggestion.
5115960	5116960	All right.
5116960	5117960	Let's go get some release dates.
5117960	5122240	So, Loki, I know there's a lot this week, but I just want to point out we're already
5122240	5128360	at an hour and a half for part A, so.
5128360	5131280	In other words, if we cut out the Hello Kitty games, I think we'll be okay.
5131280	5132280	No, don't worry.
5132280	5133280	I won't read any Hello Kitty.
5133280	5134280	I need more Hello Kitty!
5134280	5141720	Uh, Shaun White's skateboarding actually came out today on Xbox 360, and we're disavowing
5141720	5146360	any knowledge of the PS3 version, because that's not yet ready.
5146360	5150120	The re-release of Dragon Age Origins, the Ultimate Edition, it's packed with all the
5150120	5156720	download content, including the expansion Awakenings, and you can get that this week.
5156720	5161880	Family Party 90 Great Games Party Pack that is also a compilation of the last three Family
5161880	5162880	Party games.
5162880	5163880	Yeah, I'm sure.
5163880	5164880	90 awesome games.
5164880	5166440	Uh, they're really popular, actually.
5166440	5167920	You'd be surprised.
5167920	5173240	Um, and like I said, Dragon Age Origins, that was on PC, PS3, and 360.
5173240	5177160	Art Academy is a collection of two DSi games that came out previously.
5177160	5181120	That's of course on the DS.
5181120	5182880	Uh, let's see.
5182880	5183880	Nerf and Strike.
5183880	5186480	Man, it's just fucking bundles of stuff.
5186480	5188520	The N-Strike Double Blast Bundle.
5188520	5192240	It's with a gun in the two last Nerf N-Strike games.
5192240	5193240	That's on the Wii.
5193240	5201280	Cabela's Dangerous Hunts XI with the wireless shotgun, the top shotgun, and that's on Xbox
5201280	5204200	360 and the PlayStation 3.
5204200	5208120	Wii has like a gun shell that goes with it, but same type of thing.
5208120	5211480	Also the game is available by itself on those three platforms as well.
5211480	5216760	Uh, SBKX on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
5216760	5226360	Smackdown vs. Raw, 2011 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP.
5226360	5237400	Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PSP, and PC.
5237400	5244000	Pets Cats Playground on the DS, Dora the Explorer, Dora's Cooking Club, that's on the
5244000	5245000	DS.
5245000	5251840	Sims 3 Late Night Expansion Pack, now you can have your own emo vampires in it.
5251840	5252840	That's on PC only.
5252840	5253840	Do they sparkle?
5253840	5255440	I think they might.
5255440	5260400	CSI Fail Conspiracy on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
5260400	5263160	Also kind of another game similar to that on the Wii.
5263160	5265160	Buy CSI.
5265160	5270280	K. Well you know who makes that game right?
5270280	5275120	They look terrible though.
5275120	5276120	I'm hurt.
5276120	5278320	Well they should try harder.
5278320	5279400	Just kidding.
5279400	5280400	Have you ever played one?
5280400	5281400	I don't watch CSI.
5281400	5282400	See if it was law and order.
5282400	5286400	If it was law and order we'd be talking about it.
5286400	5287800	Don't worry I got your back.
5287800	5288800	Thanks Rob.
5288800	5294640	Tony Hawk Shred coming down on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii, just don't buy it seriously.
5294640	5298360	It's one of those games that requires a stupid skateboard to play.
5298360	5300920	You know what that really should be?
5300920	5301920	Skateboarding outside.
5301920	5305440	Because if you have to buy a skateboard to play a game you should just skateboard.
5305440	5306440	Done.
5306440	5310440	Halo, that'd be funny this was Halo, no.
5310440	5314680	Hasbro Family Game Night, Halo Family Late Night 3.
5314680	5315920	It's a Spartan good time.
5315920	5316920	Frag your friends.
5316920	5317920	Frag grandma.
5317920	5324200	No Hasbro Family Game Night 3 coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
5324200	5327200	Some more games with that.
5327200	5329200	Okay.
5329200	5334200	And I doubt that this is coming out on this date because why would you release this a
5334200	5335200	good week early?
5335200	5336200	But who knows?
5336200	5339160	Fighters Uncaged, I believe that's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks.
5339160	5342200	But that's the fighting game for the Kinect.
5342200	5343680	That's of course on Xbox 360.
5343680	5347040	Imagine Fashion Stylist, another game that you're probably not interested in, that's
5347040	5348080	on DS.
5348080	5352840	The Sims 3, that's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii this week.
5352840	5356080	DS and PSP as well, I believe.
5356080	5360800	Deca Sports 3 on the Wii.
5360800	5365580	And one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto IV, they're releasing a complete edition
5365580	5371040	with both Grand Theft Auto IV and the episodes of Liberty City, all for $39.99.
5371040	5376520	The Fights Lights Out on PlayStation 3, that is the move fighting game.
5376520	5379840	That's coming out on PlayStation 3.
5379840	5384520	Rock Band 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
5384520	5387280	Oh I've heard of that one.
5387280	5394060	Monopoly Streets on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and I believe DS and PSP.
5394060	5398880	Pets Nursery 2 on DS.
5398880	5402680	And Lego Universe on PC, that should be pretty big.
5402680	5404400	Oh that's the MMO, huh?
5404400	5406080	That is the awesome MMO.
5406080	5410920	I haven't even heard a darn thing about that game actually, I'm kind of curious now.
5410920	5414800	Mama is doing everything, now she's crafting.
5414800	5416840	What kind of crafting?
5416840	5419000	TF2 crafting?
5419000	5421640	Arts and crafting.
5421640	5423620	That is on Nintendo DS.
5423620	5429160	But don't worry Wii fans, there will be babysitting in your future.
5429160	5432880	Remington's Super Slam Hunting North America on the Wii.
5432880	5439840	ZHP Unlosing Ranger vs. Dark Death Evil Man, that's on PSP, it has an awesome title.
5439840	5444000	Blood Drive on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, that's going to be kind of like a Twisted
5444000	5448240	Metal type of game, so definitely check that out, I think it could be a sleeper hit.
5448240	5451040	Imagine Resort Owner, don't even bother.
5451040	5455400	Mercury Limited Edition, why I keep re-releasing these games, no one bought them in the first
5455400	5456400	place.
5456400	5458200	That's on PSP.
5458200	5470800	And Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Tag Force 5 on PSP, Fable 3 on Xbox 360, just a little game there.
5470800	5471920	What's with these tie-ins?
5471920	5478800	Mega Bloks, Diego's Build and Rescue, what you couldn't spring for the license for Legos?
5478800	5485720	Oh and Power Geeks coming out this week, not to be outdone by Rock Band, but it will be
5485720	5486980	outdone by Rock Band.
5486980	5494240	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and it is too damn expensive.
5494240	5500480	Disney Channel All Stars Party on the Wii, Intellivision lives on the Nintendo DS, and
5500480	5503040	Chevrolet Camaro on the Wii.
5503040	5507080	It's lived like every year for the past 10 years in one way or another.
5507080	5509080	Really guys, still alive?
5509080	5512960	Like I like Intellivision at all, but it might be time for it to die.
5512960	5515000	Alright, is that it?
5515000	5516000	That's it.
5516000	5517000	Alright, moving on.
5517000	5520400	Oh, I actually want to read some of the comments from chat, chat.ownerswansradio.com.
5520400	5524840	Salacious Pop is giving us some dialogue that could be used in the Halo Family Party trailer
5524840	5527080	actually here at chat.ownerswansradio.com.
5527080	5530960	Quote, how the hell does grandma keep getting headshots?
5530960	5532240	She has Parkinson's.
5532240	5534360	I hate this game.
5534360	5540960	Mom, granddad teabagged me and called me that mean word for gays and now everyone on my
5540960	5543160	headset is griefing me and laughing.
5543160	5547000	Coming to a store near you, Halo Family Party.
5547000	5548000	Right, Loki?
5548000	5549880	I'm surprised they haven't gone there yet.
5549880	5550880	They might.
5550880	5551880	They might.
5551880	5553880	We like money, cha-ching.
5553880	5560400	Alright, moving on to the Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360, Fable 3 gets its Japanese
5560400	5567960	release on the 28th, Raderji, Noah Massive, yes, Raderji?
5567960	5570720	I don't even know what this game is, although I, no, yes I have.
5570720	5571720	This is a shitty game.
5571720	5572720	Raderji's a shmup.
5572720	5573720	I've never seen this before.
5573720	5575440	They have a version of it on DS2, I think.
5575440	5580360	So yeah, Raderji is finally coming out on the Xbox, so check that out on the 28th.
5580360	5586560	Also, World Soccer Winning 11 2011 is coming out this week on the Xbox 360 as well.
5586560	5590640	Moving on to the Playstation 3 and looking at some of the releases there.
5590640	5595440	Usually they pretty much get ports of the same releases on the Xbox 360, which yes,
5595440	5602400	World Soccer Winning 11 2011, Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Edition is coming out this week
5602400	5604360	in Japan.
5604360	5610860	Also there is a slim console bundle in 160 and 320 gig models that contain the World
5610860	5616440	Soccer Winning 11 2011 game, Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Edition.
5616440	5622600	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii and the games that are coming out there this week.
5622600	5625420	Really nothing, sadly.
5625420	5628940	Nothing on the Wii this week, but that's because they got the Kirby Yarn last week just like
5628940	5631080	we did, so the Wii's a little quieter this week.
5631080	5635160	DS is a little different because the 25th anniversary DSi is out this week, so that
5635160	5636600	is a pretty big deal.
5636600	5642240	Also, Sola Torobo Sore Karakoda E is coming out this week on the DSi.
5642240	5644480	There's a regular and a collector's edition.
5644480	5646720	This is like a DSi enhanced version.
5646720	5649880	It's from the creators of the.hack series.
5649880	5654120	So it's an action sci-fi fantasy game.
5654120	5655120	This is awesome.
5655120	5658480	It's a world ruled by dog people and cat people.
5658480	5661200	And you play a hunter.
5661200	5664440	I don't know if you hunt the dog and cat people, but whatever.
5664440	5665440	Sounds interesting.
5665440	5668960	Take this, dog people!
5668960	5670640	It's Alpo.
5670640	5672160	It's super effective.
5672160	5675780	On the Sony PSP, God Eater Burst comes out this week.
5675780	5677680	That doesn't sound sacrilegious at all.
5677680	5681720	Also Phantom Brave Portable comes out on the PSP this week in Japan.
5681720	5686200	I've eaten so much God, I'm just gonna burst now.
5686200	5693360	Dark Sakura?
5693360	5699120	In the UK, on the 26th, we have BlazBlue Continuum Shift, Death Spank, which is the best name
5699120	5706720	ever, Splatterhouse, and The Sims 3, are they just getting the Sims 3 expansion?
5706720	5710240	On the 27th is Bloody Good Time, which I think is a fantastic name too.
5710240	5716920	On the 28th is Super Scribblenauts, Fable 3, FIFA Manager 11, Football Manager 2011,
5716920	5720720	which is real football and not what we call football over here.
5720720	5727720	My Sims Sky Heroes, Rock Band 3, Sean White's Skateboarding, Star Wars The Forest Unleashed
5727720	5734400	2, The Lord of the Rings Aragorn's Quest, Tony Hawk's Shred, TV Superstars, we sing
5734400	5739240	Robbie Williams, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2011.
5739240	5743440	And on the 30th, we have Sims 3 Late Night.
5743440	5748680	And since we're not having a show next week, I'll go ahead and say on the 31st is Saw 2.
5748680	5753220	I like Robbie Williams, like I know he's not a big deal here in the US, but he's pretty
5753220	5754220	big everywhere else.
5754220	5755220	Yeah.
5755220	5757480	I can see why he's getting his own karaoke game.
5757480	5762360	Alright, let's move on to some more news, and then the Classic Game of the Week is just
5762360	5763960	a few steps away.
5763960	5764960	Loki?
5764960	5765960	Oh yeah.
5765960	5771560	So this is kind of interesting, apparently, and I actually saw this on the news, which
5771560	5777600	is kind of weird, but there was a lot of, or it was, I guess, brought up by the Wall
5777600	5785000	Street Journal that there was a bunch of Facebook applications actually transmitting user IDs
5785000	5789920	and other information, I guess, to third party advertisers.
5789920	5800560	And of those applications, I guess, some of them were created by Zynga, including FarmVille.
5800560	5806260	Apparently the three of the top ten applications, FarmVille, had been transmitting personal
5806260	5809800	information about users' friends to outside companies.
5809800	5814960	Of course, your user ID is publicly available and is by itself just a number, however this
5814960	5820520	data can be, and as apparently the Wall Street Journal reports, is being shared with other
5820520	5821520	parties specifically.
5821520	5823160	Wait, wait a minute.
5823160	5824160	Wait a minute.
5824160	5830240	You mean to tell me that Zynga, the makers of that free FarmVille game and all these
5830240	5834920	other free games that they knocked off from other companies, you mean Zynga, the company
5834920	5838880	that's been called pure evil by many people on the internet?
5838880	5842120	They've been raping my privacy this whole time?
5842120	5843120	I know.
5843120	5844120	Who would have thought?
5844120	5846240	Well, if you're lying.
5846240	5854960	If I understand it correctly, it wasn't that they're like, hey, here it is, but more of
5854960	5860240	being able to access that data from other sites.
5860240	5870120	So the embedded ads and just, it wasn't just like, here you go, please take it.
5870120	5876680	It was just playing those games made that stuff more accessible to be grabbed and they
5876680	5877720	took advantage of that.
5877720	5884680	So wait, Amazon.com might know I'm gay because I've played FarmVille once in my life?
5884680	5887640	I bet you have terrible taste in games apparently.
5887640	5892400	Gosh, it keeps trying to, I wondered why it keeps trying to sell me like Will and Grace
5892400	5895720	even season seven and funny girl on Blu-ray.
5895720	5899360	I just couldn't figure that out.
5899360	5904860	And because of this whole leak or whatever, of course what's going to happen?
5904860	5909920	Some lawyers are going to catch wind of this and they're going to file a class action lawsuit.
5909920	5911800	And that's what they did.
5911800	5912800	Apparently-
5912800	5915840	Because it's the American way.
5915840	5917600	We're going to sue you about it.
5917600	5926440	Apparently law firm Edelson McGuire filed a suit with San Francisco federal court, I
5926440	5930480	guess by St. Paul, Minnesota resident Nancy Graff.
5930480	5934840	They're seeking monetary relief for those whose data was wrongly shared and injunction
5934840	5938080	relief to prevent continued privacy abuses.
5938080	5943600	And it says no specific amount was mentioned regarding the extent of aforementioned monetary
5943600	5948600	relief, but seeing as how the announcement claims the leak has affected 218 million Facebook
5948600	5954720	users, we're guessing the damages will be significant or sought will be significant.
5954720	5957440	Not necessarily what they get.
5957440	5959820	Well, I don't know.
5959820	5966620	I would say that's not too uncharacteristic for that company, but that sucks, I guess
5966620	5971400	if you're into Farmville, but honestly, you know, with Facebook and stuff, a lot of your
5971400	5975880	information is just kind of out there anyways, even if you're, you know, turning on your
5975880	5978360	privacy settings and stuff like that.
5978360	5982400	I just love though how, you know, this couldn't be timed any better because it always seems
5982400	5987340	like, you know, that guy, that, that bro that runs Facebook is like a billionaire is always
5987340	5991560	getting up on stage going, Hey, you know, guys, we're really working on the privacy
5991560	5995600	thing and you know, we want your information to be secure and information and your security
5995600	5997280	is our number one priority.
5997280	6001780	And then, you know, it comes out like literally the next day, like Farmville is selling your
6001780	6006520	information to the devil.
6006520	6009200	Facebook creator is actually devil.
6009200	6012560	All right.
6012560	6013560	Yeah.
6013560	6019280	So I did, we already went through this debate with a web browser cookies, which is essentially
6019280	6020400	what's happening only.
6020400	6022600	It's a different avenue.
6022600	6024160	It's a super cookie.
6024160	6029320	It's a super cookie, delicious, but I mean, but, but, but it just, it just seems like
6029320	6035680	all it is is like, okay, we know this is a unique user and yes, attached to Facebook,
6035680	6040720	but it's not, I'm not dismissing the issue, just trying to get more clarity on what the
6040720	6041720	issue is.
6041720	6046140	And it just seems like it's the same thing as the cookie of like, okay, unique user,
6046140	6052400	but what knocked it up the next level is that this number, which was first just like, okay,
6052400	6058100	plant there, this, this number we generate, so it can keep a unique ID.
6058100	6062760	This time it's persistent, it's more persistent because it's attached to your Facebook profile
6062760	6064460	and et cetera, et cetera.
6064460	6067960	And so anything you post on Facebook might be publicly accessible.
6067960	6069620	So, you know, lesson learned.
6069620	6073760	If you're going to use a site like Facebook, make sure, you know, if you don't want to
6073760	6079640	get it out there, don't post it or lock it down or even if you're locked down to private,
6079640	6082200	like my Facebook is locked down, so only friends of mine can see it.
6082200	6086120	And even then there's some things I just don't post on Facebook.
6086120	6088320	You know, Rob, there is a good use of Facebook.
6088320	6089800	What's that?
6089800	6094520	Like umlaut on Facebook.com slash umlaut.
6094520	6095520	Yes.
6095520	6099800	Do you have all these, you had all these plugs written down on a sheet of paper.
6099800	6101800	Wait till we get to Twitter.
6101800	6103680	It's like you're playing a game.
6103680	6107080	Which is umlaut, at umlaut.
6107080	6108360	While we're at it.
6108360	6109960	All right.
6109960	6114000	Anyhow, quickly here, you won't be able to find Rockband on here.
6114000	6118320	Sorry, umlaut fans, but one thing you will be able to find is a brand new Games for Windows
6118320	6121840	Marketplace with lots of new stuff, I guess.
6121840	6126560	November 15th is when the new Games for Windows Marketplace launches, because, you know, right
6126560	6131640	now when you think about how can I download PC games on my computer, you usually think
6131640	6136080	about, I don't know, Steam is one of the big ones or maybe Direct to Drive or even maybe
6136080	6140280	that good old game site that may have that big old joke, haha, we're shutting down.
6140280	6141280	No, wait, no, we aren't.
6141280	6142280	I think a few weeks ago.
6142280	6145040	You don't usually think about, oh, yeah, Games for Windows has their own Marketplace.
6145040	6148200	Well, Microsoft's not happy with that and they'd like to change their perception there,
6148200	6153920	so they are going to be beefing up their online portal with some more stuff.
6153920	6158480	It's all going to be branded with the whole Games for Windows Live, more competitive and
6158480	6159480	blah blah blah blah blah.
6159480	6163440	They want to make it a store, really a destination for PC gamers.
6163440	6166520	There's going to be stuff enabled through Live, all that good stuff.
6166520	6170440	So they're going to be revamping everything on November 15th.
6170440	6171920	So there you go.
6171920	6176040	And they're saying you should show up on day one because we're going to have a great pre-order
6176040	6179200	on a title you may care about.
6179200	6182280	The speculation is that it's Fable 3 for the PC.
6182280	6183280	Foreshadowing.
6183280	6186400	You know what, though?
6186400	6190240	If they can match some of those sales that Steam is having, you know what?
6190240	6193520	Competition is not necessarily a bad thing because, you know, if they're going to try
6193520	6195860	to one-up Steam, they're going to have to do so with some of the prices.
6195860	6199040	So we'll see exactly how that goes over.
6199040	6203200	In the meantime, let's get to a segment we like to do here on the show where Dark Sakura
6203200	6213000	dips into the video game vault and says, hey, you ungrateful kids with your desert bus events
6213000	6217400	and your oomblouds and stuff, you know what, you need to know where these games came from.
6217400	6219200	Get off my lawn and go play these games.
6219200	6223200	And while you're at it, yeah, that's right, no, we like to explore Gaming's Past.
6223200	6225400	Just pull up your pants.
6225400	6226400	Buy a belt.
6226400	6227400	All right.
6227400	6232240	We're going to explore Gaming's Past by checking out the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura.
6232240	6233960	What is the Classic Game of the Week from the vault this week?
6233960	6238360	I'm angry with myself for having never reviewed this one.
6238360	6239360	Sonic and Knuckles.
6239360	6241160	I've done Knuckles Chaotix.
6241160	6242720	I've done other Sonic games.
6242720	6244160	Have not done Sonic and Knuckles.
6244160	6245840	What is wrong with me?
6245840	6251080	So this is something that Sega has done right.
6251080	6252560	We have to start off with the noise.
6252560	6256200	We always have to start off with the noise.
6256200	6258200	Yes.
6258200	6267720	Best music ever.
6267720	6268720	Sonic and Knuckles.
6268720	6273480	They came out on the Genesis, also known as the Mega Drive overseas.
6273480	6279560	And it was actually developed in the US at the Sega Technical Institute by members of
6279560	6281240	Sonic Team.
6281240	6287920	And it came out on October 18th, 1994, which was, guess what, the year I graduated high
6287920	6288920	school.
6288920	6289920	Woo!
6289920	6292120	You're older than me.
6292120	6294560	Bite my butt, Rob.
6294560	6295560	I'm vintage.
6295560	6296560	Shut up.
6296560	6303240	Anyway, this was a, uh, you could play it by itself, and it also locked on to Sonic
6303240	6305240	2 and Sonic 3.
6305240	6309880	The game was actually developed with Sonic 2 and Sonic 3, so that's why it's got all
6309880	6312840	the special little nummy goodies in it.
6312840	6316400	Almost as delicious as these peanut butter cookies.
6316400	6320840	Once you've got different stories, it actually picks up from the end of Sonic 3, um, after
6320840	6322160	the Death Egg crashes.
6322160	6326280	Um, oh, just by the way, Rob, I was playing Bayonetta, and I got that they were calling
6326280	6333480	that dude Eggman, because that was Robotnik's name in the Japanese version was Eggman, anyway.
6333480	6339480	Um, and so you have to go get the Chaos Emeralds and the Super Emeralds and all the stuff and
6339480	6341840	be super awesome.
6341840	6345000	And if you get all of them, you get, you turn into Super Sonic.
6345000	6346000	Yay!
6346000	6348920	And you can go to the Doomsday Zone, yay!
6348920	6352200	And then you can join, blow up the machine, yay!
6352200	6359600	And return the Master Emerald, which leads right into Sonic Adventure, oooh, because
6359600	6364920	the island crashes back down in Sonic Adventure, and Knuckles is pissed off at Sonic.
6364920	6366560	Yeah, anyway.
6366560	6369640	And then you've got Knuckles Story, which everyone just beats up on him, and he's like,
6369640	6373880	well, crap, I'm tired of getting you, so I'm gonna go get all these emeralds too.
6373880	6377880	And that's the Knuckles Story, don't you just love my paraphrasing?
6377880	6384800	As far as the way it plays, well, you can't use Tails, oops, however, if you lock it on
6384800	6394520	to Sonic 3, then you can play Tails, I mean, you just lock it on.
6394520	6400000	It's got different bonus stages, you've got ones where you collect 20 rings by walking
6400000	6406120	through these bumpers, and then you have the slot machines from Sonic 2, like in the Casino
6406120	6413680	Night Zone, and there's, of course, the labyrinth type thing.
6413680	6418800	And then there's also the magnetic orbs that you can use to move upwards and pick up shields
6418800	6422920	and rings and lives and fun stuff.
6422920	6428320	It does not have a save slot in it, unless you combine it with Sonic 3, to make it Sonic
6428320	6431120	3 and Knuckles.
6431120	6437040	So as far as other stuff in it, again, with Sonic 3, you can use Sonic 3 to play through
6437040	6439720	as Knuckles, lots of fun.
6439720	6444520	In Sonic 2, you can play Knuckles in Sonic 2, and you don't have to have as many rings
6444520	6452960	for the little bonus zones, and you can also, if I remember right, I think Knuckles has
6452960	6459000	a lower ring, no, he can carry his rings over to the next stage instead of having to start
6459000	6460000	over.
6460000	6464640	So, that was a big thing with that, it was much easier to play through it with Knuckles.
6464640	6468320	God, I'm getting motion sickness just watching this bonus stage.
6468320	6474560	I know, I hate, I could not do the bonus stages because I would get very motion sick.
6474560	6485200	And speaking of those little bonus stages, if you tried to hook up the Sonic and Knuckles
6485200	6490360	to Sonic the Hedgehog, you would get a screen with all the cast going, no way, no way, no
6490360	6491360	way!
6491360	6498720	However, if you press a series of buttons, you can play the Blue Sphere game, a hundred
6498720	6501600	different levels of it, and there's actually different levels depending on which game you
6501600	6505820	do this with, because you can also do it with a bunch of other games.
6505820	6510320	But keep in mind, you will not be able to play Knuckles in, you know, Violent Commando
6510320	6511320	or something like that.
6511320	6512720	That just wouldn't work.
6512720	6514120	He'd fly everywhere and...
6514120	6515640	That would be kind of awesome though.
6515640	6516640	That would be kind of awesome.
6516640	6522340	Wasn't it, they weren't able to do it in Sonic 1 because Sonic's blue is also coded to like
6522340	6528320	the sky or something like that, and like, if you, you know, they change the color on
6528320	6534080	Sonic from blue to red, but then it's BLOOD SKY!
6534080	6536200	It's funny that you say that.
6536200	6541120	There's talking about hacks, um, there was a game hack called Miles Tails Prower, which
6541120	6548320	was, you know, Tails' name is Miles Prower, which I thought was always cute, um, and then
6548320	6553920	they did, um, the same group did one, it was a game basically to put Miles, to put Tails
6553920	6554920	in Sonic the Hedgehog.
6554920	6558960	They also did Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog.
6558960	6564840	So instead of using, um, changing the palettes, because you're right, it did change the sky
6564840	6573360	color, they actually lifted, um, different colors of red from, um, another part in the
6573360	6579320	game and changed the socks to blue so that he didn't have to change the palette.
6579320	6581520	So that was pretty smart of them.
6581520	6588040	Another thing, too, about Sonic 2 with Knuckles is that, um, for the longest time, um, because
6588040	6594320	of that patch that they used to make the games work together, you couldn't find a ROM of,
6594320	6599040	uh, of Sonic 2 that you could play Knuckles in for the longest time.
6599040	6602320	They've since gotten around that.
6602320	6610680	So as far as, um, the releases, what was really great, and I remember this, because I was
6610680	6617480	like, ah, I want to do this, ah, um, Blockbuster Video and MTV had a tournament at, um, where
6617480	6620160	people could play pre-release with the final one being at Alcatraz.
6620160	6627320	I don't know if anyone else remembers that, but it was, um, called MTV's Rock the Rock
6627320	6628320	Warning.
6628320	6632320	Sadly, I think I do remember that.
6632320	6641320	Um, it came out on Virtual Console, and it got a 9 from IGN, and it was very cool.
6641320	6644200	Alright, your classic game of the week, folks!
6644200	6646480	Sonic and Knuckles.
6646480	6648440	I can't do this damn stage at all.
6648440	6650480	Your bonus stages are evil.
6650480	6654280	I prefer, oh, is he finally getting the Chaos Emerald?
6654280	6655280	Yes.
6655280	6656280	Yay!
6656280	6658280	You got a Chaos Emerald.
6658280	6659280	Alright.
6659280	6662320	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6662320	6663320	Enjoy that.
6663320	6664320	It's been a long time in the works.
6664320	6667840	Sonic and Knuckles there on the Sega Genesis or the Mega Drive, whichever you prefer.
6667840	6669200	What a good ending spot, too.
6669200	6671120	That was a good ending spot.
6671120	6677160	Well, that was as good of a transition as Sega has plugs for his Umlaud tonight, so.
6677160	6679600	Which is all available at umlaud.org, by the way.
6679600	6681600	See what I mean?
6681600	6686400	Alright, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere,
6686400	6688600	because when we come back, there will be plenty more.
6688600	6690040	We've got a lot, a lot of news to get through.
6690040	6693760	We're going to ask Sega a little more about charity-related things as well, kind of like
6693760	6695960	how he started this whole charity thing in the first place.
6695960	6698520	We want to kind of get into that, especially for those of you out there that might be thinking,
6698520	6703600	hmm, I want to do a fundraiser, too, and go on radio show podcasts and work in plugs everywhere
6703600	6704600	I can.
6704600	6705600	And be a mild internet celebrity.
6705600	6706600	There you go.
6706600	6710720	So, on the internet D-list.
6710720	6716280	Not even the celebrity D-list, and then there's the internet D-list.
6716280	6724960	So like, you know, keyboard cat would be like on the B-list, O-L-R, like D-minus.
6724960	6726760	That means we can hang out with Kathy Griffin.
6726760	6729400	No, she's on the celebrity D-list.
6729400	6733920	We would get to hang out with, let's see, who would be on about the level of O-L-R.
6733920	6739320	I'm trying to think of like internet celebrities that would be on about our level.
6739320	6747920	I'm thinking, um, see even people like, even like the kid in David Goes to the Dentist,
6747920	6752600	that's like, that's like at the B-list or maybe even the A-list of the internet.
6752600	6755160	Could we hang out with a sassy gay friend?
6755160	6757220	Sassy gay friends probably up there, too.
6757220	6761000	Maybe the what, what, and the butt guy, because that's been a few years.
6761000	6765600	We might be on about that level, because it's been a few years since he was popular, so.
6765600	6766600	Okay.
6766600	6767600	All right.
6767600	6774880	Rob, we're probably up there with double rainbow guy, because he's kind of.
6774880	6775880	What does it mean?
6775880	6776880	All right.
6776880	6780520	Anyhow, all joking aside, I wanted to kind of read this real quick, because this is a
6780520	6784080	comment in our chat room from, and it relates to a story that we had just brought up a minute
6784080	6785080	ago.
6785080	6787880	This is a comment in our chat room from our pal Derek H, who is one of the hosts, or I
6787880	6793240	should say really the host, because he always has co-hosts with him, on Dead Pixel Live.
6793240	6797120	He's there weekdays at All Games Radio, he hosts his own little shindig there.
6797120	6798120	It's a lot of fun.
6798120	6805160	He sends us this link to a story on Slashdot about, is Zynga trying to patent virtual currency?
6805160	6808920	Since we were talking about Zynga, and how some of their ethics may be questionable once
6808920	6812400	in a while, I thought this was kind of fascinating.
6812400	6817400	Apparently a recent patent application was spotted by Zynga, attempting to patent virtual
6817400	6822800	currency purchased with real money for use in a gambling context.
6822800	6827080	But I'm thinking, and this website's thinking as well, aren't there already plenty of
6827080	6833720	ways that that exists, like, I don't know, Xbox 360 money, or, I mean, just a lot of
6833720	6835040	MMOs out there.
6835040	6836480	You can buy money.
6836480	6842140	But if they get the patent, then they have the patent, but if they get it denied because
6842140	6847160	of prior art or whatever ruling, then they can say, if someone else tries to claim it,
6847160	6854440	they'll go, oh, no, no, no, no, we did, and the patent office said, oh, it can't be patented.
6854440	6857160	So maybe it's a move to protect themselves in the long run?
6857160	6858160	Yeah.
6858160	6861160	What do you think filing all these patents and all this news is for?
6861160	6862160	Interesting.
6862160	6863160	All right.
6863160	6864160	Fair enough.
6864160	6865160	Fair enough.
6865160	6868120	So we'll see what happens with that, because heaven forbid they should be granted the patent.
6868120	6869920	But we'll see.
6869920	6870920	All right.
6870920	6873120	Anyhow, we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6873120	6874120	Don't go anywhere, guys.
6874120	6875120	Stay tuned.
6875120	6882800	We'll be back right after this.
6882800	6885320	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6885320	6892800	We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 24th of 2010, for the 387th episode of
6892800	6894680	our Lil Podcast here.
6894680	6895680	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6895680	6900080	Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at AllGames.com, where you just heard during
6900080	6902840	the break there, if you were listening live, we can't put it on the podcast because it's
6902840	6903840	copyright music.
6903840	6905520	We played some music from DJ Hero 2.
6905520	6908900	It kind of had the whole thing going live here in studio, that was pretty awesome.
6908900	6915040	Also live in studio tonight, joining us, The Segg is one of the co-founders of UMLOUD,
6915040	6917320	but he really hasn't talked a lot about it tonight.
6917320	6921640	And I've been coaxing him like, hey, if you show up to the show, you've got to try and
6921640	6923600	drop a plug or two for what you're trying to sell.
6923600	6927760	It's hard to get people to go to umloud.org and read all about our charity.
6927760	6928760	Yes.
6928760	6929760	All right.
6929760	6931720	So just try to work in a couple more plugs if you could.
6931720	6935360	You know, Segg, I just would hate for you to have wasted that tank of gas to get here
6935360	6937400	and then just not talk about your charity event.
6937400	6940200	I know, exactly.
6940200	6943720	It's really hard trying to get people even to follow our Twitter account, which is at
6943720	6944720	UMLOUD.
6944720	6945720	U-M-L-O-U-D.
6945720	6946720	All right.
6946720	6947720	Good job.
6947720	6948720	All right.
6948720	6949720	Let's see.
6949720	6952160	Quickly, I want to ask you some more questions here since we have you here tonight.
6952160	6953520	You're so kind to be here live.
6953520	6957720	I know one thing you've also been doing a lot of this year, besides the telltale stuff,
6957720	6961500	besides the UMLOUD planning, another thing you've been doing quite a bit is you've been
6961500	6963100	doing speaking events.
6963100	6966800	And I know you did PAX East because I saw your panel there when I went to PAX East earlier
6966800	6967800	this year.
6967800	6968800	And I know you did.
6968800	6969800	Didn't you do a companion piece at PAX West?
6969800	6970800	Yeah.
6970800	6972280	Kind of same song, different verse type of deal.
6972280	6973800	Same song, different time.
6973800	6974800	Yeah.
6974800	6975800	Different audience.
6975800	6977720	What was the panel all about that you were doing?
6977720	6986240	Well, it was trying to communicate, okay, there's a lot of people who obviously give
6986240	6993200	to Child's Play and there's definitely a lot of people who want to do more.
6993200	7002280	And what I wanted to do with the panels is to establish and get the right general questions
7002280	7007320	answered for people who want to start their own Child's Play community fundraiser.
7007320	7011680	And what that means and just sort of the broad overview of where to get started and to take
7011680	7018640	that next step of starting your own event, whether it's a local event or an internet
7018640	7019640	based event.
7019640	7024840	Obviously, we could probably have you recap everything, but that would take an hour, like
7024840	7025840	your panel.
7025840	7028040	So I don't want to recap the whole thing.
7028040	7032800	But just trying to get some of the points out, what would you say for somebody who is
7032800	7035280	trying to plan one of these events for themselves?
7035280	7037880	And maybe you can speak from experience on this.
7037880	7044240	What's one thing that people don't anticipate when they say, hey, I want to throw a rock
7044240	7049680	band charity event at this, I don't know, the Masonic Lodge or wherever people are doing
7049680	7051800	things, you know, we want to do like a little charity event.
7051800	7055840	And what do you think is like one of the top things people don't foresee in the planning
7055840	7058640	of these events that comes back to surprise them?
7058640	7060960	Like oops, we should have thought about X.
7060960	7067720	Well, besides the legal thing, which is a whole other conversation, we'll touch on a
7067720	7078680	few moments, but the big thing that I stress is set up what I call a list of products,
7078680	7084840	if you're doing an event where, okay, these are the things that we're going to have as
7084840	7087400	a quote unquote product for the event.
7087400	7091960	So to take Ooma out, for example, we have this ultimate band package product, we have
7091960	7097480	this headliner band product, we have the ticket in the door product, we have the raffle ticket
7097480	7098480	product.
7098480	7103800	And by listing these down, you go, okay, how do we make this happen?
7103800	7109320	And that's what's really sort of lost because people don't really know how to take the thing
7109320	7110320	from soup to nuts.
7110320	7115560	It may be a great idea, but you're actually at the event and you go, oh crap, how do I
7115560	7116560	do this?
7116560	7117560	Oh crap.
7117560	7121960	Oh, we have to do all this stuff and then fumble from there.
7121960	7129000	So it's really take a step back with your team and go, start brainstorming, get all
7129000	7134360	the ideas in the world, but then realize that it may be best to put some things off the
7134360	7139720	table if you can't deliver on them because if you do too much and not account for it,
7139720	7142040	it's all going to go to shambles.
7142040	7150080	It's best to just hold back and make sure you establish yourself and maybe next year
7150080	7152360	you'll do that thing that you wanted to do or whatever.
7152360	7153360	All right.
7153360	7154360	Awesome.
7154360	7155360	Let's see.
7155360	7156360	I'm trying to think of other things.
7156360	7161800	Do you think sometimes people maybe think too big when it comes to these things?
7161800	7163160	I would say, yeah.
7163160	7167360	And as people who have the best of intentions and I'm not, believe me, I'm not discouraging
7167360	7170880	it as someone who did a show in eight weeks.
7170880	7177840	Well, first of all, for UmLoud, UmLoud wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Fundrauser,
7177840	7183760	which was an event that was actually founded by Joel Johnson, started in New York and then
7183760	7191680	grew to Denver with Brian Casante of Kotaku doing the Denver event and then Gizmodo did
7191680	7199960	the San Francisco event and I went to that event, showed up and it was at Shine Bar on
7199960	7206040	Leet Mission Street in San Francisco, 1337 Mission Street, and it was a 200 capacity
7206040	7213040	bar and it was just show up with rock band, you know, very simple, but packed the place.
7213040	7217360	And that established, okay, there is, we can get enough people in here and that was just
7217360	7220480	with day of advertising.
7220480	7225920	And I always, I hadn't done charity work for a while and I wanted to get back into the
7225920	7227680	swing of it.
7227680	7235400	And separately, I always wanted to do an event that incorporated rock band, guitar hero rock
7235400	7239320	band, but focused on the performance aspect.
7239320	7245920	And it was just this perfect storm, so I threw my hat in and that's when I first got introduced
7245920	7252120	to Chris Kohler, who also helped out with the Fundrauser event in 08.
7252120	7256940	And it was also, you know, planning this out, actually throughout the year, but with Joel
7256940	7265840	and Joel had a lot of things going on so he can continue on and so we were left with making
7265840	7271920	our own event since we already had the deposit reserve for DNA and got things together.
7271920	7277880	And it really, it also, don't do this alone, I think is the other thing.
7277880	7284280	If you, you know, if you can't get other people to do it, don't break yourself.
7284280	7289720	And I'm not trying to discourage people, I'm not trying to knock them down.
7289720	7293400	Even if you're a big control freak like me and like you just, you want to do everything,
7293400	7296200	like you just have to let some of it go because it's too much for one person.
7296200	7301760	It goes down to if you can't get people to help you quite yet in working the event, how
7301760	7303320	are you going to get people there?
7303320	7305000	That's a fair question.
7305000	7306820	You know, it's a fair question.
7306820	7313360	I would say be realistic, but don't that outright discourage you.
7313360	7314360	Right.
7314360	7316920	Don't let any of this scare you off from trying to do something like that.
7316920	7318040	I think that's important too.
7318040	7321720	Like we're just, we're just trying to be real here on OLR and say, you know, if you're ready
7321720	7327080	to take this dive, by all means dive, but here's some floaties, some tips so that you
7327080	7328080	don't drown.
7328080	7331680	So let me get you a question from our chat room if I could here at chat.orangetonstrategy.com.
7331680	7335920	Salacious Pop is in chat and wants to know, Segg, how long did it take to get incorporated
7335920	7342320	as a nonprofit so that people could legally write off donations to you in their taxes?
7342320	7343320	Are the fees steep?
7343320	7347400	Did you have to do it through an attorney to protect your own name and assets?
7347400	7356880	I have the benefit of a wonderful father who does this pretty professionally.
7356880	7363560	I say that just like he doesn't actually have it as a job job, but he, we, as I, as I alluded
7363560	7368880	to the sort of the family business that wasn't really a business was charity events back
7368880	7379240	home in Detroit, Dearborn, and like we did Detroit Children's Hospital Festival of Trees
7379240	7381800	and our high school auction and all that.
7381800	7388360	So he already knows how to, you know, the tax end of things.
7388360	7393320	The state of California was definitely new to us and, oh, the state of California was
7393320	7402360	definitely new to us for those filings, but it's sort of a level thing.
7402360	7408440	We were, the official birth date as far as the IRS and the state of California's concern
7408440	7417200	for UMLoud is November 17th, and that was when the California you are a business that
7417200	7422240	happens to be nonprofit was first minted, which is pretty quick.
7422240	7427720	But then for all the stuff you want to do, like donation buttons, either PayPal or Google
7427720	7433480	checkout and all that, yes, you know, and we got the TIN very easily, the tax ID number
7433480	7441100	for UMLoud, but then you have all this other stuff that has to go through, like it takes
7441100	7447160	a while for the IRS to process the paperwork and you have to fill out the longer form and
7447160	7448160	all this.
7448160	7453960	So really things did not get settled, settled, settled as far as establishing and getting
7453960	7462200	our determination letter from the IRS till like February, but it's sort of the, yes,
7462200	7466680	you were okay as long as you fill out your paperwork, but as of November 17th for us,
7466680	7467680	we were still in the clear.
7467680	7470680	You mean the government is slow in processing paperwork, you don't say.
7470680	7476000	Well, the IRS even outwardly says, yes, we're going to take a while and you are okay to
7476000	7480920	work as a nonprofit, but put your paperwork in and know that, you know, we could revoke
7480920	7485640	the status because something didn't clear, which they didn't, you know, we had our, everything
7485640	7487160	was up to snuff.
7487160	7490880	Just to back you up in our chat room, Defective Candy is in our chat at chat.ornsontradi.com
7490880	7495220	and says, from experience, the state of Michigan is way easier to do the nonprofit than a place
7495220	7496220	like Cali.
7496220	7503520	Yeah, California actually, from what I've been told by others, is the most complicated
7503520	7504520	in the union.
7504520	7509760	I should also state that every state has a different way completely.
7509760	7516960	I mean, the IRS is obviously consistent within the U.S., outside of the U.S., I don't know.
7516960	7517960	Sorry.
7517960	7518960	Go ahead.
7518960	7519960	Oh, okay.
7519960	7524560	But, you know, that's, when I do these panels, I guide people to the general questions that
7524560	7531560	they have to ask themselves, which is basically start by googling up your, whatever entity
7531560	7538240	in your state does business entities, secretary of state usually, but not always, sometimes
7538240	7541800	they have a separate department and all that, and that will start you down on the road of
7541800	7542800	what you need to do.
7542800	7544440	But don't let all this stuff freak you out either.
7544440	7549800	Now, I should also say that, like, there's sort of two general avenues of, at least for
7549800	7552200	child's play, community fundraisers.
7552200	7557760	There's the actual local physical event, which is what we do, and then there's the internet-based
7557760	7558760	fundraisers.
7558760	7563840	Now, the internet-based ones, they haven't made, as long as they're not stupid, and that,
7563840	7570920	because, like, for example, Desert Bus, which is the online telethon for them, they point,
7570920	7577320	they use chip-in to point directly to the child's play PayPal account, meaning they
7577320	7580760	never touch the money, ever, period.
7580760	7586120	The chip-in tracks the metrics of how much people clicking on their button went to child's
7586120	7591600	play, but they never touch the money, so they don't have to do any of this.
7591600	7595680	We touch the money at UMA because we have to, you know, pay for the venue, and we're
7595680	7602640	taking in donations ourselves in this physical event, so we have to go through the process.
7602640	7610760	The big numbers, at least for the IRS, at the IRS level, is if you get more than $250
7610760	7618960	from any one individual, or your total take is $5,000, you need a file, you know, you've
7618960	7622560	graduated up to, nope, you need to do it for reals.
7622560	7625840	There's a great follow-up from Defective Candy here in our chat room saying, there are some
7625840	7626880	great books on the matter.
7626880	7631320	I like Nolo's How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation, and all states have info on how to do them
7631320	7632920	on their official website.
7632920	7634960	You might have to do a tiny bit of digging.
7634960	7637200	Let me throw this out there, too, one more kind of little thing here, because I know
7637200	7638880	this is one of the things I took away from the panel.
7638880	7642320	I was like, oh yeah, that's something I might not think about otherwise.
7642320	7648800	But say, if somebody wants to do a child's play fundraiser, you know, before just throwing
7648800	7652320	the name out there like, hey, we're going to do this child's play fundraiser, there's
7652320	7654840	probably people they should be getting in touch with, right?
7654840	7660760	Yeah, the, Kristin Lindsey is, I'm sorry, Kristin, I'm totally forgetting your new title
7660760	7665680	position, the official title, but she's the woman in charge of child's play.
7665680	7667560	We won't call her goddess of child's play.
7667560	7670280	Yeah, goddess of child's play.
7670280	7672280	She has an official title, and I apologize for that.
7672280	7674560	It's okay, it's live radio, you're on the spot.
7674560	7679680	But it's sort of, child's play's not going to give you too much help, because let's face
7679680	7682040	it, it's a...
7682040	7683040	They're not going to run the event for you.
7683040	7685280	They're not going to run the event for you.
7685280	7689860	It's good to check in with her, you know, and sending an email to her saying, hey, we're
7689860	7698920	doing this event, and she'll give some help, but you have to understand that everyone else
7698920	7705720	is doing all this stuff, especially around this time when the season's ramping up again.
7705720	7709840	And the process of giving them money is, if you're doing the chip-in thing, the internet-based
7709840	7713960	thing, well, you don't have to do anything, it's already into their PayPal account.
7713960	7720500	But for us, it's, we mail a checkout made out to child's play charity, and mail it in
7720500	7727340	to the mailing address that's on the child's play website, and there's that.
7727340	7730600	But it's just good, and it's one of those things that you might think is obvious, but
7730600	7734400	I don't think everyone really thinks of this, is that if you're going to do a charity fundraiser,
7734400	7736720	go ahead and contact the charity.
7736720	7737720	They like to know these things.
7737720	7738720	Yeah.
7738720	7739720	Yeah.
7739720	7743920	And you never know, you might get a plug on the website or something, or a tips at least,
7743920	7748120	things maybe you haven't thought of before, so, you know, things that other people have
7748120	7749120	learned.
7749120	7750120	So, all right.
7750120	7754840	Well, I don't want to spend too much more time talking about that, I don't want to ruin
7754840	7760660	your possible panels in 2011, so I don't know if you're going to be doing it all over again,
7760660	7764800	but it was, at least when I went and saw it at PAX East, I certainly learned a lot.
7764800	7768240	I know we've kind of dabbled in the idea of maybe doing an OLR charity something something
7768240	7771720	at some point, so it was interesting to hear all that, so good deal.
7771720	7775280	All right, well anyway, we're going to move on with some gaming news, and Seg of course
7775280	7779040	is going to stay with us here to talk a little more about the gaming news and Dish with us
7779040	7781040	this week.
7781040	7784760	We'll first do some rapid news, then we're going to get into the Twitter topics, so quick,
7784760	7786440	some rapid, rapid news, Loki.
7786440	7790680	Yes, Interplay has announced that Fallout Online will be coming out in the second half
7790680	7796960	of 2012, and it's interesting, there's been a little bit of back and forth between Interplay
7796960	7801760	and Bethesda over the rights for Fallout and stuff, and I believe at one point Interplay
7801760	7807080	was demanding $50 million for Fallout, and apparently Bethesda said no.
7807080	7813920	So it'll be interesting to see, and I'm sure that a Fallout MMO will be pretty interesting,
7813920	7818360	but we'll have to wait a couple years for that.
7818360	7824040	The ESRB is rated Twisted Metal for the PlayStation 1 classics, so obviously they'll be coming
7824040	7828220	around pretty soon, maybe they'll tie in a little bit with the new Twisted Metal game
7828220	7834080	maybe coming out next year, so we'll have to wait for that one, but at least you can
7834080	7835560	expect that.
7835560	7840360	And then a racing game that is on the PlayStation 3 right now, ModNation Racers, is going to
7840360	7848120	be getting a Stunt Pack free, I guess it's going to have some cool ramps and whatnot.
7848120	7854520	The Stunt Pack will include a double-decker bus, an interactive truck, an interactive
7854520	7862000	truck trailer mini-ramp, as well as some wide stunt ramps, thin stunt ramps, thin rails,
7862000	7866200	tilling platform, framing, skull ring, all sorts of cool stuff.
7866200	7870480	And that is free for two weeks, that's beginning October 26th, so if you do have that game,
7870480	7874600	or if you're thinking about picking up that game, you might want to download that.
7874600	7875600	Hurry hurry!
7875600	7881440	Alright, I've got some quick stuff for you guys too, one of them is about Xbox Live.
7881440	7887680	The Xbox Live Silver account is no more, it is gone, it is out of here, but don't worry,
7887680	7890820	you didn't all get suddenly upgraded to gold, actually I don't think that's something anyone
7890820	7891820	would worry about.
7891820	7894640	No, here's what really happened, the Xbox Live Silver memberships are now just called
7894640	7897120	Xbox Live Free Membership.
7897120	7898120	It is what it is.
7898120	7899640	Yeah, finally.
7899640	7900640	So there it is.
7900640	7906240	And that is launched right along with the Xbox.com remake that went live this week,
7906240	7909720	so they just basically say it's free.
7909720	7914400	They're saying the features did not change, the name for the paid membership did not change,
7914400	7916240	just this little component of it.
7916240	7917240	Just so you know.
7917240	7918240	It's easier branding.
7918240	7919240	I think so.
7919240	7920240	Yeah.
7920240	7925920	Plus, I think especially when one of PlayStation's big things is selling like the free PlayStation
7925920	7927760	network, I think for them to be able to say...
7927760	7928760	Not quite anymore, but...
7928760	7929760	Yeah, exactly.
7929760	7933880	You know, now they're kind of on par there, so it works out.
7933880	7937560	Tron Evolution is getting some voice acting from the movie, which is pretty cool.
7937560	7942620	Olivia Wilde, who plays Korra in the upcoming Tron Legacy movie, is going to be doing some
7942620	7944360	voices in Tron Evolution.
7944360	7945360	That's pretty cool.
7945360	7949400	Also, the voice of the original Tron character, Bruce Boxleitner, is going to be in there,
7949400	7950760	so that's pretty awesome.
7950760	7952840	From the scarecrow, Mrs. King.
7952840	7958040	Sadly, not all of the actors are in there, like I don't see that, what's his name, Garrett,
7958040	7961080	whatever that's playing the main character, and Jeff Bridges I don't see in the list,
7961080	7964000	but just about everybody else seems to be in there, which is pretty cool.
7964000	7965000	Jensen Ackles.
7965000	7969280	That makes me personally happy, because I have a major, major, major thing.
7969280	7973920	And seeing as I believe I heard the game is kind of set in between the two movies, they
7973920	7979600	probably did something with the story where they didn't necessarily need the A-list actors.
7979600	7984320	NBA Jam, as we've talked about for a couple weeks on this show, is getting spun off into
7984320	7988400	its PS3 and 360 retail releases.
7988400	7995760	The game is going to be $49.99, and it's coming out November 17th.
7995760	8001360	Also, it should be noted that it is going to be online and all that, but not on the
8001360	8002440	Wii.
8002440	8003600	That version is already out.
8003600	8007440	Online will be available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.
8007440	8009400	There's going to be two-on-two online.
8009400	8014160	There's going to be a title update in December that will have a remix jam party for up to
8014160	8020080	four players and all sorts of that fun stuff, so $49.99 if you want to check out NBA Jam
8020080	8022240	on the 360 or the PS3.
8022240	8024360	He's on fire!
8024360	8025360	Boom shakalaka!
8025360	8027760	Boom shakalaka!
8027760	8044400	In other news, for fans who really like the music in Castlevania Symphony of the Night...
