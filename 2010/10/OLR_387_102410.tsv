13875	26151	Tonight, October 24th, 2010, two Capcom worlds collide in an upcoming 3DS game, fans of Sonic the Hedgehog up the ante in a new HD version, and in one country, Grand Theft Auto 4 is ordered off the shelves.
31690	36892	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36992	42033	We are that radio video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
42053	46455	We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.
46715	50196	www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
50516	54577	Joining you over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.
54617	57638	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
58285	58966	Storms, LOL
79585	82287	Everything is so dried out from a long summer that it just screws everything up.
108507	114672	and the oil floats all up to the top of the streets and it becomes a big slick and no one knows how to drive in the rain.
116393	119395	But it's been raining for almost, it feels like a day straight.
119795	121236	It rained yesterday almost all day.
121436	122037	Crazy.
122457	123018	I've enjoyed it.
123058	123678	I like the rain.
123798	124559	But I've been sick.
124959	128822	So I like rain when I'm sick because then it makes all the warm food I'm eating so much better.
129127	129828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
150771	155733	All right, say hello, of course, to Tech Master Loki, also joining us tonight, as he always does.
155873	156213	Hello.
156573	157654	And complete with what?
157794	159414	Are we on quadruple bacon pizza now?
159594	160074	Not yet.
160375	165016	I didn't want to scare them with the thought of putting four times the amount of bacon on a pizza.
165036	166517	They'd have to make you sign a medical disclaimer.
166537	167597	I'd eat them into that, you know.
168858	169138	All right.
170218	171679	How have things been for you?
171739	172439	How's the baby doing?
172859	173640	Baby is fine.
173780	178502	He was with mom going to her parents' house.
179403	179903	And where's that?
179963	180524	Is that in the bay?
180824	181184	Folsom.
181684	181905	Oh, okay.
181925	182565	That's not that bad.
182885	183946	Is he pooping fine?
183966	185086	Yeah, he's pooping just fine.
185267	185687	Okay.
186067	187528	Because I remember the poop scare.
187708	188989	Inquiring minds want to know.
189389	189749	All right.
190630	192131	Joining us in studio tonight.
192171	193652	Yes, in studio, not on Skype.
193692	197954	We love having guests actually come down to the studio and hang with us.
198375	200536	Say hello to our pal, The Seg.
200556	200696	The Seg.
200856	202478	Hello, OLR!
202498	203859	Wonderful to be here.
204199	205120	Wonderful to have you.
205461	207523	Thank you so much for coming out here.
208184	214270	I haven't really had a chance to say it to you before we've gone live because it's just been go, go, go, go, because I was running in the door late tonight.
214710	218214	But I did get a new mic cord for Dark Sakura, so it wasn't all for naught.
218234	218734	So just saying.
219135	220076	Hopefully it works tonight.
220196	221217	I'm not having to hold it in.
223262	223922	That's what she said.
224223	224503	All right.
225363	233625	Anyway, but Seg, you drove all the way here from the Bay Area, which is a good... Well, usually it's probably about an hour and a half, but I'm going to guess because of the rain, it probably took like two and a half hours.
233645	235106	No, it was exactly an hour and a half.
235166	235486	Oh, good.
235686	238226	You know, I am from Detroit, so I actually know how to drive.
238927	239007	So...
241007	251261	Yeah, Ford family here, so... Well, regardless, no matter how long it took you to get here, it is quite a bit of a tank of gas, so I do really appreciate you coming out and hanging here in studio with us.
251781	254004	Not quite as glamorous as it sounds on the radio, huh?
254565	255286	Well, you know...
256067	259450	You don't have to pull back the curtain for everyone out there on the internets.
259550	260211	Yeah, that's all right.
260491	260731	All right.
260771	263954	Yeah, I meant, of course, our microphones are all gold-plated.
263994	267658	This couch is absolutely wonderful.
267798	269880	Give me more grapes, servants.
269960	270220	All right.
271961	273443	Well, Sag, you are here, though.
273463	275745	Of course you have ulterior motives for being here tonight.
275785	276445	Not that we mind.
276505	278187	We appreciate a reason to have you here in-house.
278467	281050	But you're here to promote a little something-something that's going on, right?
281090	281410	Yeah, just...
281570	282610	Just a little something.
282810	288132	And you might have heard of it because, you know, gosh, we've only mentioned it on the show about 50 gazillion times.
288712	293254	That's okay because it's a charity thing and we'll say it a gazillion more times for charity.
293334	294434	What is up?
294494	296515	What's the big event that you are co-hosting?
297040	299881	Umlaut, a rock band night for child's play charity.
300601	307104	It's a performance-based rock band night, and I really stress it as performance.
307224	308564	It's not a competition.
309104	312366	We don't give a care about your score whatsoever.
313006	315947	It's all about rocking out for child's play charity.
316627	324074	Yeah, no one, as the old saying on the internet goes, no one cur if you have a crappy score on a song or what have you.
324454	327977	You're going to get the most props if you're really into it.
328037	329458	Like the outfits and stuff.
329779	332081	Some of the stuff I saw last year, outstanding.
332201	334703	The Lego Rock Band people were great.
335164	339027	There was lots of dress-ups, bands, good times.
339827	368572	So we started it last year under the wake of Fundrauser which went away but it was Chris Kohler of Wired.com game life blog Joe Marquette of Game Helper and myself and we put on San Francisco's Child's Play charity event community fundraiser for Child's Play and last year we did it
369224	371085	all soup to nuts within eight weeks.
371765	377068	And that's also incorporated as our own nonprofit to be all nice and legal.
377929	383171	And I guess I should talk about the band packages because that's really where we're leading into.
383511	384072	Sure, why not?
384372	385652	We're all over the map, but that's okay.
385673	387113	We're everywhere.
387153	388534	That's why it's a three-hour show.
388574	390175	We can never stay on one track.
390195	390815	So it's fine.
390875	391716	Take all the time you need.
391876	396818	So it's not... We don't do the just go up and play at a bar.
396838	398199	Like if you go to a bar or anything...
399672	400453	to play rock band.
400473	404094	It's usually one screen and everyone is looking at the screen.
405454	411896	What we do is have the performers turn around and face the audience and perform out to the audience.
412616	418558	There's monitors on the stage floor, but they look like speaker monitors to the audience because it's next to the speaker monitors.
419418	419558	And
420046	421488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
436124	440546	And then they have one song that they pick that no one else will play on their main stage.
441526	445807	So, like, if I claim a song, and I say, like, Gaga is mine tonight.
445927	446367	It's me.
446728	447388	I am Gaga.
447708	449789	Then nobody else can pick that same Gaga song.
449829	452289	First come, first serve.
452309	454710	But, yes, once it's locked in, it's yours.
455651	457131	No one else will play it on the main stage.
457211	461833	Because that really sucks at, like, karaoke sometimes, and you've got, like, four people in a row, you know?
462233	465734	Because we belong together now
466174	467215	It's like, oh god, shut up.
468655	471036	They all get progressively worse.
471056	473317	There are 2,000 songs in Rock Band.
473577	474678	It's going to be hard to duplicate.
475058	477559	Is that even counting the network stuff?
477919	481180	I think their 2,000 count counts the network stuff.
481720	483441	But still, that's a lot.
483821	489123	But the thing is that we don't know what's going to happen with these bands when they show up, especially last year.
489163	490444	We didn't know if people were going to get it.
491885	497969	I mean, we didn't know if people were just going to like, oh, I'm playing rock band or like, no, this is my rock concert.
499490	501531	And there were people that got it.
502192	507936	The one band that to me really got it was Ironhead.
508556	511378	as in the Brutal Legend game.
511758	513059	Yes, I remember that.
513079	515420	There's pictures of that girl all over the internet.
515460	516520	I should plug the website.
516540	532349	If you go to umloud.org, now that's U-M-L-O-U-D, umloud.org, and you'll see the little flicker button there too, and that will give you all the pictures, and you'll see Ophelia there.
532809	534310	She's pretty hard to miss because she...
535170	542132	Uh, spent a couple of hours before, you know, that day being dressed up in blue makeup, head to toe.
543032	546492	Uh, and I didn't know that they, I mean, I knew they were named Ironhead.
546532	552674	I knew they were doing, uh, uh, um, I'm totally blanking on the song name.
553554	554734	Whatever song they did, yeah.
555014	556034	Uh, Hellion Electric Eye.
556755	562256	And when they hit the stage, you know, I saw her there dressed up and like, oh, that's one of my bands.
562856	563016	Yeah.
563536	568278	and then when they performed it was absolutely amazing.
568638	569358	They got it.
571019	574820	And this year we hope to have more that get it.
575701	579022	The ante is being upped now that people are seeing the pictures from last year.
579082	582263	It's like, how can we just even take it a step further?
582283	584344	You know there's going to be people that are like, we gotta outdo.
584504	586585	And we want to facilitate that at Oomloud.
587885	591987	Which is why we're doing something additional to the event.
592087	592767	Now, the
593311	594472	The Ultimate Band Package.
594512	597333	That's the band package that we did last year and then we're still doing.
597753	600734	Those go on sale November 1st.
601235	608218	But we decided we wanted to do one really special package that we're calling the Headliner Band.
608998	613460	And this package is, there's only one of them because it's the Headliner.
614511	619175	So it's auctioned off and it's actually going on right now through eBay.
620115	622337	And they get a two song set.
623218	628882	And as long as they don't dilly dally, they get first choice for the night to reserve those two songs.
630262	637485	They're the headliners, so obviously they're on the flyers, they're on the posters, they're on the video that we make.
638346	647790	We actually have Area 5, which is a video production company that will be making the commercials and, assuming schedules gel well, will be...
648590	662053	Doing the video for us with the headliner band And you get your own place at DNA Lounge, which is the venue that we're in With drink and food service all provided to you So you can have people feed you grapes?
662733	672976	Yes Alright, awesome I'm liking this so far And that's going on now, and that auction actually ends Thursday at 4pm-ish
675276	684382	and we really hope we get a lot of people bidding on that thing because the donation all goes to Child's Play.
684842	687644	I was going to stress, this money is not going to SAG.
687664	690285	This money is not going to DNA Lounge.
690325	692066	This money is going to charity.
692587	693787	All of it, right?
694468	701312	It's going to Child's Play charity which provides video games, toys, and other financial support to children's hospitals around the globe.
702172	712240	and it's kind of known as the Penny Arcade charity, but even Penny Arcade wants to stress that it's not like, oh, this is directly all Penny Arcade.
712540	719325	They want to stress that this is, yes, they house the offices and the staff,
720146	723829	for it, but... They planted the seed, but it's grown into its own thing.
723869	732937	And especially with all of the community fundraisers that happen, like Goom Lab, but also Desert Bus for Hope and the Mario Marathon and all the others.
733438	737782	These are people... Child's Play itself just is the direct servicer.
737842	740604	They take the money and...
741912	748677	Directly deal with the child's life services or equivalent of the children's hospitals in their network.
749017	751719	And they get the toys there.
752079	755241	They make what toys are needed and all that.
755841	758763	So what's given is exactly what the hospital needs.
759684	767749	And what the community fundraisers do is help in very creative, unique ways to raise money for this charity.
772112	780237	Every year for Child's Play has beaten its high score the previous year, including the past two years when that shouldn't have happened.
780877	784679	Economic downturn.
785220	792564	Child's Play was one of the very, very few charities that increased their giving.
793745	797827	That's everything to do with these community fundraisers across the globe.
797987	800268	Do you guys have a fundraising goal set for Umlaut this year?
800288	802289	Or is that one of those, you know, I don't want to talk about it type of things?
802689	804530	Well, it kind of is.
805890	806891	We always want to do more.
807471	815794	And we just focus that energy on making the best event possible.
817213	820734	without making much cost of how to put on the event.
821154	822674	And we have a lot of partners that help us.
823014	823734	Let me ask this.
823754	825115	Can I ask how much we raised last year?
825215	831056	Last year, I wrote the check out and mailed it in for $7,000 to Child's Play.
831196	831436	Nice.
831796	832156	Very nice.
833416	837477	And that was eight weeks of putting everything together.
838077	839057	It was kind of last moment.
839397	841838	So this year, we hope to improve on the situation.
842698	848543	and also a lot... Umlaut is... Just for the record, I would have never known that it only took eight weeks to do if you hadn't told me.
848984	850745	You guys did a really good job last year.
850845	854448	I don't even know how we did it.
854628	856070	And I'm not just saying that because you're a friend.
856150	859052	It really was a smooth operation.
859553	861074	We also have good partners.
861194	862075	DNA Lounge...
862835	871200	Jamie Zawinski, the owner, and Barry and all of them over there are just absolutely wonderful to us.
871520	874382	We definitely make sure they're in the loop.
874502	876123	We definitely respect them as the venue.
876143	878524	Harmonix is on this too, right?
879084	880065	Yeah, and Harmonix.
880545	882306	I should say, we will have
883857	887318	Every song playable in Rock Band 3.
903502	904343	We actually have two stages.
904383	909990	So I know I've been stressing the main stage and the performances there, which is the show in itself.
910390	913314	But there's a lot of other things that we have there.
914015	919141	We have in the lounge room, the second room, free play rock band show up.
919801	931130	We have the donation bin out there to kind of guilt you, but it's free play, we don't care, just walk up, that's your traditional bar, rock band setting, and that's free play.
931150	935674	Last year was like the Beatles room, because that was the big game last year, and this year is just kind of whatever is clever?
935974	940478	Well, we don't know what we're going to have special yet for...
941617	950787	We don't know what we have special yet for this year, but last year we debuted before it came out the Rubber Soul album from Beatles Rock Band.
951588	954912	Which is the best and it's sitting in my closet right there.
956033	956834	It's somewhere in there.
957034	958455	Well, am I going to get Jamie to go with me this year?
958535	959776	Maybe she can belt out a tune or two.
960816	961137	Maybe.
961477	962878	On the beast, I will make you go on the main stage.
962938	963818	Actually, let me ask this.
963858	967361	I'm sorry to take this wheel in another direction, but this question has been kind of like lingering on my mind.
967901	970863	Maybe I'm not a person that wants to get up in front of the crowd.
971163	971643	You know what?
971823	976907	I want to help the charity, but singing in front of people is not my thing.
977567	980329	What fun things can I expect to have at Umlaut?
980789	982670	Well, first of all, it's the performances.
982790	985351	As I said, they are performances.
985632	989493	And if you search YouTube for Umlaut, you'll see what I mean.
989534	996757	I mean, yes, the cell phone cameras, but you'll see the kind of performances.
996857	1003941	And that alone is worth the $10 door, but we don't stop there.
1006862	1007843	We will have...
1008803	1012406	What's been called the nerd yard sale.
1014007	1029260	And we clean out the closets of various game studios and developers and publishers and news outlets and all that to clean out all the swag they've collected for the year and just put it out on the table.
1029660	1034764	And if you pay for the door, you pick one thing from the table.
1035085	1036466	So you at least walk out with something.
1037406	1063257	but in addition we're going to have a raffle and some pretty good prizes if I do say so myself we'll be announcing those a lot of right now our attention is all on the bands because we're trying to get this auction that you know finished on you know it ends Thursday and then the following Monday is when we get the ultimate band so we're kind of geared towards that and then we make the push of please show up
1063917	1066779	Well, I wanted you to get that out there, that there was that going on.
1066819	1073184	Because we do, believe it or not, there are a few friends of our show that work at various developers and things.
1073264	1092158	And even though I know they don't email us or talk to us all the time because they don't want to talk about their projects, if you happen to work for a developer or some type of game studio and you have some extra stuff sitting in a storage room that maybe some fans might want, Umlaut would be a great charity to kind of give those to, right?
1092198	1092298	Yeah.
1092518	1100447	Yes, we actually are looking for sponsors, both financial as well as gifts and all that.
1100467	1110698	We are our own nonprofit, so we are our own 501c3 in case people are a little weary of not giving directly to Child's Play.
1110718	1112140	First of all, yes, it's going to Child's Play.
1112160	1112681	Right.
1114742	1135793	and donating to us directly is also legal in the state of California and the United States as a non-profit so please if you want to give us stuff or be a financial partner with us please please please go to umlaut.org there's that sponsor link there and we would love to talk to you
1136781	1137282	Thanks for watching!
1157365	1162367	Well, I'm trying to think what else to kind of get out here before we move on with the show.
1162728	1167210	I'll ask you more maybe later on the show, Part B, kind of about what goes into the actual planning of the event.
1167530	1171752	But as far as the event itself, anything else we need to know about what's coming up December 9th?
1172632	1174293	It's Thursday, December 9th.
1174313	1176375	I stress the Thursday because last year was on Wednesday.
1176875	1177996	We leveled up to Thursday.
1178376	1184260	And if we get more people, we may be able to level up for weekend.
1184520	1188322	So it's really important for people to show up.
1188403	1192445	So if you're anywhere remotely near the Bay Area, please come on down.
1193886	1203113	And tickets, if tickets are on sale right now, you can click on tickets on the website if you know you're not going to be in a band, but do want to show up.
1203333	1204454	That's really helpful for us.
1205314	1211318	I should also note that if you are in a band package, you're on the guest list, you get in, you're good.
1212900	1217122	But if you have any inkling of showing up, please show up.
1218243	1220405	You will not regret it.
1221145	1225028	And for those of our listeners, because, you know, we are, believe it or not, an international show.
1225068	1228531	We have folks that listen to the show in Mexico, in Sweden, and all these places.
1228951	1233235	You know, I just, as much as we really want them to come, they're probably not going to be able to swing it.
1233515	1236157	But there are ways they can still participate if they're very far away, right?
1236337	1236517	Yes.
1237018	1240400	We have the donation button right on every single page at Inland.org.
1240821	1241401	Of course.
1241641	1246845	Which is, if you, Child's Play uses PayPal for direct donations.
1247586	1249027	We use Google Checkout.
1249751	1259617	And I want to stress that we're not trying to take money or have this bidding war between who donates to Child's Play and who donates to Umlaut because it's going to the same place anyways.
1260257	1264499	But if you feel more comfortable with Google Checkout, the donation button's there for you.
1264980	1267461	If you want to go straight to Child's Play, awesome.
1267601	1270803	It's ChildsPlayCharity.org.
1271243	1274225	And that just goes such a long way.
1275484	1275984	Absolutely.
1276324	1279425	And I have a good feeling you're going to beat that $7,000 this year.
1279805	1280605	I have a really good feeling.
1280725	1281665	I sure bloody hope so.
1281825	1282145	All right.
1283486	1284646	Well, best of luck, Seg.
1284806	1286826	And of course, you're going to be sitting in on the show tonight.
1286846	1289307	So feel free to chime in on anything gaming related.
1289367	1290447	Oh, I'll have opinions.
1290747	1291587	Oh, I bet you will.
1291667	1298149	Especially there might be stories about a particular developer that might be of interest to you.
1298189	1298589	But we'll see.
1299229	1299569	DarkSakura.com
1324857	1328502	I can't put into words what a big freaking deal that is.
1329684	1330745	I just want to put out there.
1330805	1332728	Because everybody but me thinks I can sing.
1333689	1335031	DarkSakura is actually a pretty good singer.
1335832	1339777	Can we extend that maybe through the next week for our podcasties who maybe aren't listening live tonight?
1339977	1340498	If we get 150 tonight.
1342439	1343660	Oh, okay, you're throwing down.
1343880	1344220	Alright.
1344680	1351702	If we don't get 150 tonight, if we get 250 by next weekend... She's throwing all these random numbers out there.
1351742	1353423	No, seriously, because there's a method to my madness.
1354023	1370669	If we don't hit 150 tonight, and they have a way of saying donate in the name of... If they go through the Umlaut donation button, I can't, I have obviously no access to the Child's Play one, but...
1372563	1374685	Yeah, there should be some sort of note, I think.
1376766	1377046	It's been a...
1383291	1386312	We'll figure out the logistics.
1386592	1399377	If you do donate, if there isn't some place to put it in, obviously, can people email... Let's have them email the receipt number.
1399437	1402819	Email your receipt to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Perfect.
1403099	1403559	That works.
1404594	1408377	But if you can't put it on there, make sure you say For Orange Lounge Radio.
1408997	1409277	Alright.
1409637	1421966	And if you happen to buy a million copies of Eye of Judgment tonight, then... How about if we can raise... How much money can we raise to get Loki to go to the show in a Tingle outfit?
1422906	1427690	How about if we can raise $1,000 by the night of the... No, I'm not going.
1427750	1428990	We gotta watch it.
1429030	1432413	Okay, if we can raise $1,000, but then I'll dress as freaking Tingle shit.
1435214	1435514	Uh-oh.
1436335	1436855	She said it.
1436955	1437415	She said it.
1437475	1438216	All right.
1438296	1439196	Okay, okay.
1439716	1447800	If we can raise $1,000 by the night of Unwild, I will go as a Parapara girl.
1448940	1449741	Blonde wig and all.
1450561	1450801	All right.
1450962	1453144	Well, regardless of how much... I'll wear some costume.
1453264	1457168	Regardless of how much is raised tonight or until the night, you're at least going to go to the show, I hope.
1457929	1458229	Yeah.
1458429	1458890	Absolutely.
1458930	1459170	All right.
1459190	1459350	Good.
1459490	1459831	Oh, shit.
1459851	1460772	I've got school that night.
1461693	1462213	Cut class.
1462954	1463354	All right.
1463394	1463895	I'll think about it.
1464155	1464476	All right.
1464816	1466257	Tell the teacher it's for charity.
1466898	1467178	All right.
1467699	1467999	Anyhow...
1468880	1471541	DarkSakura, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?
1491738	1492198	What else did I play?
1492298	1495260	Oh, Bayonetta, because she is a sexy bitch.
1496521	1498642	And what else did I play?
1498902	1500383	I played some Final Fantasy XIII.
1501744	1504166	I tried to play some Star Trek Online, but I'm pissed off at the Borg right now.
1505106	1506207	Very, very pissed.
1506267	1511971	Okay, if somebody knows how to pass a stupid Borg mission, let me know, because I am pissed off at it.
1511991	1513972	It just says, defeat Borg, steal data.
1514901	1516502	There's 50 of them in there!
1516862	1517622	It's a viniculum!
1541912	1543213	and he said, oh, that's my rogue.
1544194	1545614	Ah, that's great.
1547115	1548977	So it made me think of you because it's all Star Trek nerds.
1549277	1549737	That's great.
1549797	1551038	Why isn't he playing Star Trek Online?
1551658	1552459	Probably is.
1552699	1553439	Must be on a Mac.
1556461	1558582	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1558683	1562385	I have several friends who actually can't play Star Trek Online anymore because they don't have it for Mac.
1565819	1595583	hurry up, get out oh yeah, and I also played a lot of Plants vs. Zombies because I'm addicted, addicted, addicted to jackpot mode in Plants vs. Zombies and zombie bowling and I played a bunch of other stuff too I've given up on Narbacular Drop I'm done with it, given up oh, and I played some Portal
1596735	1597536	Portal, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1626321	1627822	I haven't really been playing that much this week.
1628302	1633725	No, the only iOS game I think I've really been playing a lot of recently is... How about Unicorn Attack?
1633745	1634425	No, actually not that.
1634745	1636666	I did play some last week, though, on the show.
1638027	1641509	No, I've been actually addicted to Cartoon Wars 2.
1641969	1647272	It's a tower defense game with stick figures, except they have heavy artillery and stuff.
1647752	1648693	And it's pretty awesome.
1648733	1650273	They have everything from, like, you know...
1651394	1670292	Medieval weapons, swords, spears, bow and arrows and stuff to giant mechs and bazookas and all that fun stuff So it's pretty fun, I'm just grinding along right now And then I played a little bit of DJ Hero 2 and I'm totally digging the new songs in there
1670772	1671953	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1692262	1699106	Some of the old 90s rap stuff that's in there is alright, but I don't know.
1699126	1709052	I just think they need more variety in some of the songs because I can only hear so many remixes of California before I just get sick of it.
1711033	1711773	Or OPP.
1712294	1712474	Yeah.
1712830	1722543	Yeah, it's too bad you can't get the booty mashups or that kind of level because they have to actually get the licensing for the music.
1722843	1723765	More gorillas!
1724105	1724846	More gorillas!
1725187	1726729	They have the stylo mix with itself, yeah.
1729463	1731085	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1748963	1754607	But I like kind of just playing it more relaxed instead of just trying to mash buttons like crazy in it.
1755308	1759711	And even on medium, it's mashing buttons like crazy with a lot of the songs.
1759771	1769718	Like the Firestarter remix with itself, it was just insanely... It was more difficult than I anticipated for a song like that.
1769898	1770779	Well, that's why you chose poorly.
1792721	1795663	I didn't load the soundboard before.
1796683	1798765	Now, do they have where you can play as your home character?
1798805	1802147	Because, you know, Sony's really innovative with all their home features, right?
1802347	1803908	Are you really asking that?
1805149	1805749	Like, really?
1807430	1808271	Oh, Sony.
1808291	1810012	I want to play it with my me.
1810132	1811373	Let me answer that with a sound.
1813919	1816386	Delayed radio, boys and girls, thank you.
1816807	1819415	I used the toilet today during the other podcast.
1819495	1820478	During that other show?
1821067	1822828	Which I have to say something about soon.
1823248	1823788	Alright, we'll get to it.
1824629	1828971	We're hopefully going to have some DJ Hero music during the break.
1829111	1835094	Although, smart me forgot to bring my stupid VGA cable for my 360.
1835935	1844859	So, I'm trying this really, you know, I guess MacGyver way of getting it to work by hooking up my video capture card through my PC.
1845560	1845760	But...
1847421	1850683	It doesn't like the fact that it's on two different networks, so I have to plug it into the router.
1851424	1854826	But the router's cords are so short that I can't pull it out.
1856437	1857758	and Grand Theft Auto.
1857798	1859319	You can't pull it out?
1859679	1860700	You can't pull the router out.
1862120	1864482	I don't want us to start disconnecting random cords.
1865102	1868464	As if the storms weren't causing enough problems with the internet out.
1868524	1871726	The last thing we need is Loki.
1871866	1873207	I think I can pull the gray cord.
1874808	1875548	Cut the red wire.
1875628	1876869	We're running long tonight anyway.
1876889	1878550	The gray one is actually the main.
1882532	1883733	I'll just take a look at it.
1884453	1885694	And free cookies!
1886155	1887036	Yes, cookies!
1887796	1888357	Make it all better.
1889317	1891319	Seg, how was your gaming week?
1891399	1896704	I've been so busy, but I know you were going to ask me this question, so I really made it a point to actually play games.
1898605	1909355	I've been playing Costume Quest, which just came out on Xbox and PlayStation 3's downloadable service.
1910496	1921585	and this is Double Fine's first let's not make a game once every five years game and it's really good.
1922705	1927990	They set out to make a nice, I'll say light RPG game
1929030	1945375	And the concept is, you either play, I'll say the two main characters are twins, a guy and a girl, and there's literally the point in the intro cutscene where you pick which gender you're going to be, pretty much.
1946115	1949036	And the one you didn't pick gets kidnapped by monsters who...
1950336	1958100	are trying to collect candy, but the adults think that they're just big kids dressed up so they don't believe the kids that there are real monsters out there.
1958160	1959641	This sounds like Saw for children.
1961522	1962383	Make your choice.
1962703	1972328	And you're wearing costumes because it's Halloween, but when you go into battle mode, the costumes that are like cardboard and tape, they turn into...
1973155	1975018	I'd totally be down for a G-rated Saw movie.
1989542	1990343	What would be the point?
1991243	1992064	It would be funny.
1993685	1995246	Anyhow.
1996007	2000991	I've also been playing Game Dev Story on the iPhone because, you know, I can't get enough of game development.
2002832	2004133	And it's a nice little game.
2004393	2014921	It feels like it was a cell phone game, like your, you know, before the iPhone, you know, the days of before, before, before.
2015021	2015242	But...
2016283	2023974	It's a really nice little game that I can play a little bit and put it to a side.
2024475	2030564	And then I got something else as I pull out my Rock Band keyboard.
2032806	2040854	and I've been playing Rock Band 3 over the weekend for research for Room Loud.
2040894	2041295	Of course.
2041315	2042756	Because there's no fun to be had.
2046980	2047660	Thank you for watching!
2062125	2077698	cannot stop the rock so are you going to have up to seven people because yeah awesome uh you know obviously if if it's a rock band one song well you know it's a rock band one song but um if the song supports it yeah though for harmonies though
2078120	2082763	We have all three mics, and they're actually plugged into the sound system before they're plugged into the game.
2083383	2088646	So we just have the mics on all the time, and people can just do harmonies or whatever anyway.
2089987	2094109	So even if you have a Rock Band 1 song, if you want to have backup singers anyway, no harm, no foul.
2094169	2094970	No harm, no foul.
2096631	2097712	And it's not about the score anyway.
2097992	2098392	Exactly.
2099793	2100073	Awesome.
2100873	2105716	It gives the sound engineer actual control with the voice to make you sound good.
2105736	2106817	Yeah.
2107119	2111263	So I know you haven't been able to spend a lot of quality time with Rock Band 3, but what do you think of First Impressions?
2111303	2112083	A worthy upgrade?
2112724	2120691	It is definitely Harmonix finally putting into practice the years of research and all the things they've done.
2120711	2124514	Not that they haven't, but it's just they now, they got it.
2124774	2127276	You know, like, they're able to put it together, and that's...
2128197	2129318	and it really shows.
2131199	2142208	I like how career mode is sort of always on in the sense that even when you're just doing quick play, it's still contributing to... That's so awesome.
2142768	2143248	Thank you.
2143749	2144950	There is career...
2146684	2158657	activities, like very structured career activities of like, okay, here's two songs and a set of five go and an achievement is associated with that.
2158757	2162040	But just in general and in broad is just play.
2163281	2190406	the game and it's just always it's ranking up it's more of raking up the personal your personal account so it's really stressing more of bringing your profile putting it on your USB stick when you go to your friends and then you're raking up when you're at your friends place oh cool and doing that profile well that sounds really interesting yeah they're doing that so you don't have to make all these separate bands anymore that's kind of cool that's very interesting so let me ask this real quick what was the first song you had to play
2191837	2192838	What was the first song?
2192878	2193958	I should have recorded that.
2194619	2198421	Oh, I thought there might have been one.
2198441	2201863	No, I started doing Career Path and I'm totally blanking on it.
2201903	2206086	But the first keyboard song, Rock Lobster.
2209980	2215984	I'm sorry, the correct answer should have been Bohemian Rhapsody.
2216485	2218206	I'm sorry, Sag, you lose.
2218246	2221649	That button's never going to get old.
2221889	2223730	It's my favorite button.
2223750	2226392	I'm saving that for when I play with friends of mine.
2227973	2231356	That you need a band for because it was just me playing alone.
2231936	2232697	Fair counterpoint.
2232917	2233618	All by myself.
2233898	2235359	I saw the trailer for Pro Mode.
2235419	2237821	That was pretty crazy with the new guitars.
2238522	2239343	Yeah, wow.
2239503	2242485	Yeah, the pro guitars, damn.
2243065	2246847	And the MIDI Stratocaster that they're working on?
2247168	2253652	Well, actually, the MIDI stuff, like the Rock Band 3 keyboard itself is MIDI out ready.
2253712	2255833	It is a MIDI keyboard.
2256703	2272008	and on November 28th they'll have a breakout box for real professional MIDI instruments and just to plug it in directly into the console itself.
2273989	2276810	I can't tell you how excited I am for Pro Mode keyboards.
2277350	2282712	Oh yeah, and that's beauty because you can do Pro Mode with the Rock Band keyboard.
2283672	2291575	The only thing that you out and out need new equipment for is guitar in regards to Pro Mode.
2291895	2295617	Drums, you do need the add-on for the extra cymbals.
2295817	2298378	I'm talking about the new ones because the old ones kind of suck.
2298908	2303172	Well, they're not doing a new, new rock band drum set.
2303312	2305214	But they fixed the cymbals a bit.
2305414	2313241	But the cymbals, the add-on pack is new, but there's no rock band 3 drum bass, you know, the bass of the drum kit.
2313261	2314662	There's no new rock band 3 one.
2314802	2319246	It's just they're now packaging it with the new cymbals.
2319606	2322249	They don't have a promo for singing in there.
2322620	2324841	No, well, what is promo mode?
2324861	2325762	Well, you get harmonies.
2325982	2327403	Promo mode's oom loud.
2328824	2329624	Nice, like that.
2329664	2334307	Well, and honestly, if you go into whatever the hard mode is, it's pretty hard.
2334547	2334847	Yeah.
2335067	2336508	I'm a Beatles rock band.
2336548	2341811	I mean, these are songs that I grew up with that I wasn't hitting perfectly, so.
2344640	2359115	I also do want John Drake will thank me for this Pro mode is great when you want to go to pro mode but don't feel that you're losing the essence of rock band if that just doesn't attract you
2359916	2377150	Um, I've actually, uh, we're actually discussing taking, uh, guitar, pro guitar off the table for Umlaut just because it's too new, it's an instrument switch, and we want to focus on performance, you know, people performing and not just going on this technical prowess.
2377291	2382515	I think you, you would be fair to say, you know what, it's too much of a pain in the butt to swap out the guitars every time.
2382735	2385237	Now all you have to say is those guitars are too damn expensive.
2385557	2385818	Done.
2387839	2388560	You're all sorry.
2388580	2388980	Uh-uh.
2389080	2390841	We sold the guitar and gave the money to kids.
2390941	2391182	Deal.
2391822	2392102	Alright.
2393183	2395845	Alright, anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us?
2399901	2404402	A little bit of a Scott Pilgrim, trying to finish that out, but then Costume Quest came out, so there's that.
2405343	2419387	Since I'm going to get crap from Bobby Blackoff if I don't try to get you for info on this at some point, because since you haven't brought it up your day job, you do work for a certain developer out there that makes a lot of amazing adventure games.
2421407	2423068	Is Back to the Future as awesome as it sounds?
2426190	2427191	Oh, it sounds awesome.
2427771	2433915	Because if you go to TelltaleGames.com and go to the blog tab, it's on game trailers.
2434115	2445763	But Telltale just posted a quick little interview with the voice of Marty McFly.
2448024	2449605	It is in Michael J. Fox, though.
2450106	2451787	He did give likeness rights and all that.
2453368	2453808	I'm trying to...
2454963	2456944	He sounds very close to Michael J. Fox.
2456964	2461087	Yeah, and let's not forget Michael J. Fox is about twice as old as he was when the movie first came out.
2461868	2468132	And I still have to say, he didn't give his likeness rights for the pinball table, so this is kind of big.
2469713	2482901	AJ LaRosso, I'm probably mispronouncing his last name and I apologize, but all I'm just going to say, go to the video and you'll hear how good it sounds.
2483121	2483922	Now, did you get Biff?
2486155	2490638	You know, AJ is doing a great job with sticking on target.
2492619	2495221	We do also have Christopher Lloyd as doc.
2495281	2496762	He's voicing and everything.
2497043	2501686	You need to seriously get him to say every word in the dictionary because that guy is not getting it.
2501706	2502206	Get him while you can.
2502246	2503848	Yeah, get the fiend on the table on him.
2504728	2511077	Alright, I'm not going to pry too much on the day job because I respect that you're a friend and we don't want to see you get fired for saying too much on the show.
2511097	2513981	Well, talk about my game like Puzzle Agent.
2514061	2515503	Let's talk about what's out.
2515864	2516665	Puzzle Agent.
2517266	2518488	Yes, Puzzle Agent.
2519189	2519729	Which is actually...
2520930	2548740	Artstyle of Graham Annabelle who does the dank or dunk, depending on what mood he's in, comics on the TelltaleGames.com website and also has a lot of video shorts and we made a game with really his artstyle but new characters of Nelson Tethers, Puzzle Agent the single agent of the FBI Department of Puzzle Research They have that?
2549200	2549280	Yeah
2551004	2551505	They do now!
2580587	2607220	but uh no it's it's a it's it's a puzzle game with a plot and we try to do made the make the puzzles at least the the critical path ones uh relevant to the plot enough uh you know obviously there's a suspension of disbelief but try to not do something like I I can tell you this key important thing you need to know about the plot but first here's a puzzle of matchsticks uh but um
2609944	2610604	We're having cat drama
2632313	2634334	But no, it's a nice little fun game.
2634394	2636655	It's out on platforms.
2637336	2638156	iPhone and PC, right?
2638236	2639457	iPhone, PC, and Mac.
2640177	2640597	Oh, okay.
2640717	2641278	And Mac, yep.
2641618	2642118	Can't forget them.
2644239	2644599	Yeah, okay.
2644639	2645580	I think I've plugged enough.
2646120	2646340	All right.
2646380	2647281	No, that's no problem.
2647361	2649241	We appreciate you being here.
2649262	2650142	You can plug whatever.
2650922	2653544	I'm not going to – I don't even know what you're working on now.
2653564	2655585	You probably couldn't talk about it anyway.
2656065	2660147	But best of luck with all the upcoming projects over there at Telltale and keep up the good work.
2660167	2660347	Thank you.
2660547	2664768	Oh, and just saying, there really, really should be an Elvira adventure game.
2665068	2667009	Yes, we need Elvira.
2667049	2675991	If you haven't heard last week's show, we're just thinking, you know, speaking of celebrities you want to get before they're too old, Elvira really needs a good game treatment.
2676051	2677871	So just something to think about for next Halloween, okay?
2678352	2679012	Just throwing that out there.
2681353	2681733	Let's see.
2681753	2683154	I was trying to think what that was.
2683214	2685115	I knew there was a game we were trying to pitch.
2685235	2685776	What was it?
2686076	2687156	Was it Golden Girls?
2687357	2687697	No.
2687917	2689538	Well, that too, actually.
2690659	2692239	That's going to be a little hard to do now.
2692820	2700444	You're not going to really be able to get Bea Arthur, but you might be able to get the drag queens that play the Golden Girls in San Francisco around the Thanksgiving season.
2700484	2700785	Forget it.
2701645	2702827	Alright, let's see.
2702847	2703628	My gaming week.
2703908	2708314	I was all excited this week because Alan actually bought me a game, and you'll appreciate this.
2708494	2710597	Alan actually bought me a copy of Poker Night.
2711117	2712439	Oh, bless his heart.
2713100	2718246	Yes, he bought me a copy of Poker Night because Steam was having an awesome little pre-order thing on it, and he's like, Oh, Rob, I bought you a game.
2718266	2718887	Let's play the game.
2718907	2719328	And then it's like...
2719933	2721494	Oh, the game's not out yet.
2721514	2722874	They're selling it on Steam.
2724135	2725895	But I'll be ready to go day one.
2725915	2727256	So thanks for that, Seg.
2727596	2728076	No problem.
2729857	2731057	I had to rash on that at some point.
2731378	2734679	But no, obviously, it's going to be cute.
2736239	2737980	Okay, I'll plug Poker Night, fine.
2738040	2740221	I'm not looking for anything.
2740641	2745383	My expectations going into this game are not like, my world is going to be rocked.
2745783	2748946	It's just going to be like... It's going to be a cute poker game with funny characters.
2749607	2749787	Right?
2750287	2761097	We've been telling people... Yes, it's Texas Hold'em Poker with Tycho, the Heavy from TF2, Max of Salmon Max, and Strong Bad.
2761918	2762138	And...
2762838	2786828	it has more dialogue than any single episode of a Telltale game so it's not going to be five lines repeated for every single play all the time there's going to be some variety to it and it's five bucks I was selling those hotcakes at PAX actually because we also threw in a poster with it I've tried for three days to buy it
2788268	2788809	How does that work?
2788829	2791213	My PayPal hasn't ever gone through.
2791474	2792536	Well, now, whose fault is that?
2792676	2793137	Not mine.
2795649	2796730	It's Valve's problem.
2797070	2799092	Steam or whatever.
2799872	2801714	Poker Night is coming out soon.
2801734	2803916	They haven't even told me.
2805417	2808019	That's really cool to know there's all that dialogue.
2808359	2814884	Honestly, my expectations going in, I was thinking this is going to be like an Xbox Live Arcade style poker game with characters I recognize.
2815445	2815865	That's cool.
2816025	2818587	I hope there's a lot of trash talking.
2818607	2821009	That sounds like it could be a part of it with all that dialogue.
2821329	2822110	Things are said.
2822130	2823071	Ha ha!
2825837	2827918	Words come out of mouths.
2828618	2834199	There may or may not be playing cards in the game in some shape or fashion in Poker Night.
2835460	2835680	All right.
2835740	2836720	All that stuff aside.
2836940	2837880	So I have that to look forward to.
2837960	2842241	I will say a game I did buy on Steam that is out and has been out for a month that I played this week.
2842261	2846703	The listeners should be very proud of me because I don't think WoW was the game I played the most this week.
2846943	2847563	Shock and awe.
2847663	2851784	But World of Warcraft was probably actually down there on the ladder this week because...
2852284	2859926	I finally got Civilization V on Steam and I've been playing the heck out of Civilization V because it's great.
2860426	2868728	I haven't decided if I like it more than 4 yet because I haven't truly got to the end of a game yet because it is so long.
2869328	2870089	Oh my gosh.
2870589	2871029	But it's good.
2871069	2871589	That's a good thing.
2873589	2877170	But it's way better than 2 or 3 in my opinion.
2877390	2879351	Way, way better than 3, that's for sure.
2880291	2880892	But it's great.
2881173	2884297	The Hex tile thing is actually one of the things I noticed the least.
2884618	2888323	It's a very fluid transition for the series and a very kind of like logical next step.
2888704	2890646	I really like a lot of the subtle changes they made.
2890787	2895053	I like the fact you can't stack armies on top of each other and just build like super army.
2895573	2900616	I like the fact that only one unit can defend a city, so you can't have these uber cities.
2901696	2904538	It makes you have to think a different way.
2904898	2909660	I like that they have talent trees that they call social policies.
2909720	2910861	It's kind of a neat addition.
2911581	2913002	There's all these cool little things they've added.
2913062	2914142	Very customizable games.
2914542	2917444	Lots of difficulty levels, lots of sizes.
2917904	2919985	The city states thing is really neat.
2920205	2921825	I didn't think I would like it at first.
2922285	2928228	A city state is basically a whole new civilization that is only ever one city.
2928368	2929829	They don't aspire to grow.
2930169	2933310	They don't aspire to do anything but exist in their little city state.
2933630	2934151	DarkSakura.com
2960294	2964939	Not only did I get the French to surrender, but the French gave me Pittsburgh Really?
2965079	2980355	How they had that, or no, sorry, Philadelphia How they had Philadelphia, I don't know, but I got it now All of those sandwiches are so French Maybe the bread It's now a Greek city in my game, because of course I'm playing as Alexander the Great
2982850	2983491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2998109	3004254	Philadelphism is a big word Okay, I'm just saying you said the French gave it to you when you were in Greece
3019736	3021296	It's kind of interesting how that worked out.
3023057	3024617	I totally forgot what I was going to say.
3024957	3030538	Oh yeah, the thing about Civ is you can always save, but it's always that one more turn.
3030618	3032339	Yes, yes, oh god, yes.
3032979	3034039	That's what makes it fun.
3034099	3037760	I didn't go to bed until 1am the other night because of one more turn.
3038680	3040340	Just one more turn.
3041060	3042501	And Paris will be mine.
3043741	3044121	And it was.
3046582	3047142	So just saying.
3047562	3051043	Spazinator said a junk ferret running around Paris will get France to surrender.
3051603	3053624	By the way, I do want to also acknowledge our chat room.
3053664	3054664	I've been such a bad boy.
3054704	3056245	I haven't acknowledged chat all night long.
3056445	3057945	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.
3057965	3058365	Please join.
3058385	3059846	They've actually been a little bit quiet tonight.
3059986	3060346	I don't know.
3060926	3061426	Chat room.
3061446	3062207	Memorized by my voice.
3062227	3063147	Rob needs a spanking.
3063387	3065408	Maybe they're... Yes, maybe they just are...
3066888	3074075	Well, of course, sadly, we don't have a whole lot of people from the Bay Area, so I think we've got a lot of people that are kind of like, oh, sounds cool, but, you know, plane tickets cost a lot.
3074255	3074556	Yeah.
3075336	3079801	But we do have, I know, a lot of podcastees in the Bay, so hopefully we'll see a lot of them at the show.
3079861	3083464	I know I'm going to go come hell or high water, so I'll be there for sure.
3083484	3088869	Well, also, actually, you know, for the... I don't know about...
3089890	3096220	Other local physical events happening at 4 Child's Play.
3096361	3100928	But there's also Desert Bus for Hope, the Loading Ready Run guys.
3101529	3102451	They're starting...
3104013	3104934	I want to say them.
3105415	3106596	Actually, no, I got it on the calendar.
3106716	3114204	But these are the folks that play Desert Bus as a marathon run for Child's Play Charity.
3114304	3119789	And they start November 19th, unless things changed around a bit.
3119849	3122412	But they'll do the live stream and all that on the 19th.
3123433	3139003	which is definitely interesting to watch because yes they're playing Desert Bus but they're also a comedy troupe so they really make it a telethon show with it awesome I've tuned into a little bit of it before it's funny, it's good times what a crap game to be playing
3139844	3142026	What a crap game to be playing for so long.
3142266	3144369	But hey, make some money.
3145630	3147533	And also, Umlaut will be streamed live.
3147773	3148414	I forgot about that.
3150616	3158386	So starting at 7pm California time, go to timeanddate.com to figure out what that means for you.
3160008	3163352	The event will be streamed live, so you can actually watch the performances.
3165254	3169960	The Umlaut website will change over to that mode when it's actually happening.
3170080	3174586	And last year, weren't you the most streamed event in the lounge's history?
3174686	3176808	Well, no, we killed their internet.
3178310	3185256	We didn't kill it, but we were the one event that used the internet the most.
3185776	3192162	This being from a venue that is currently owned by one of the co-founders of Netscape.
3192922	3193943	We're very proud of that.
3193963	3198467	They actually increased wireless capacity after that.
3198747	3203812	I don't want to say it's because of us, but feather in our cap.
3204512	3204913	Yeah.
3205973	3206354	All right.
3206574	3207514	Congratulations on that.
3207594	3207894	Thank you.
3208215	3208475	All right.
3208995	3211636	One more game that I played this week I want to talk about is DJ Hero 2.
3212297	3217820	Even though Loki kind of already talked about that a little bit, I just want to give my spin on it, pun intended.
3219301	3223023	I wasn't going to buy the game originally because I was like, oh, yeah, $60.
3223203	3223523	I don't know.
3223863	3224523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3244728	3245669	Yeah, boy!
3245789	3247111	Over and over again with the button.
3247191	3249193	I love the way they're doing the freestyling now.
3249233	3249834	It's so much better.
3250294	3252537	And the freestyle crossfades are great.
3253097	3254879	And the scratching zones are really cool.
3255240	3258643	So many more ways to freestyle and really ruin such great songs.
3260745	3262746	I do appreciate all that they've thrown in the interface.
3262786	3265246	The head-to-head modes are more interesting.
3265867	3267307	I like the interface as a whole.
3267427	3275329	Even though the black and white look is a little bit too plain, I just kind of like the construction of the game a lot more than I did the first mix.
3275749	3280791	So it's a worthy upgrade in the interface and what it brings to the table.
3282096	3283177	Rihanna's Rude Boy Rihanna's Rude Boy
3303314	3307797	There was some weird ones that I didn't recognize the song.
3307878	3312441	There was one with a Tiesto song that was like an R&B song or something mixed with it.
3312461	3315223	It was surprisingly good, actually.
3316224	3319006	I will hopefully play those during the break.
3319426	3322449	I'm attempting... This is like disarming a bomb over here.
3322469	3324851	If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.
3324871	3325871	No, it's going to work.
3326412	3328473	I've got the stuff to make it work.
3328954	3330014	You don't understand, Rob.
3330054	3331596	We're not going to stop and ask for directions.
3333058	3333319	Alright.
3333800	3334882	One more bit of housekeeping.
3334982	3335223	Please.
3336185	3336605	Contest!
3337748	3343511	I was threatened with domestic repercussions by my significant other if I played any song that had Soulja Boy in it one more time.
3343531	3343571	So...
3366221	3367022	DarkSakura has a contest
3385234	3393879	This is our contest, and the prize is going to be a code for Xbox Live to play Castlevania Symphony of the Night, which is a fun game, one of my favorites.
3395900	3405565	The question is really easy, and we are going to be taking an emailer at a random number, which we will decide by literally rolling a die.
3407543	3408063	on the show.
3409183	3413324	This is in relation to Comic Insanity, which is the other podcast that I do.
3414084	3423706	And we broadcast every... We're actually up on InfamousNFAMOUS.net on Mondays is when the new podcast is up.
3425246	3432147	The question you have to answer is what is the name of he who shall not be named on Comic Insanity?
3433307	3434168	I'll give you a clue.
3435208	3435688	We hate him.
3438055	3439516	That so narrows it down.
3439556	3439876	Wow.
3440056	3440797	That could be anybody.
3441357	3441777	It's me.
3443338	3451103	And you can send your emails to... Go ahead and... I guess go ahead and send it to the mailbag here.
3451563	3452083	I'll check it.
3452224	3458327	Mailbag at orangezonesradio.com I will sift through it and we will roll a number at random and I'll pick a name.
3459048	3459348	Awesome.
3460051	3460952	And now the other contest.
3461552	3461853	More!
3461993	3464535	Which isn't us, but a lot of people would be interested in this.
3465295	3471280	Also at Infamous.net, there is a contest to win a bunch of Blizzard goodies from BlizzCon.
3472121	3473662	If you missed it, there's stuff for you.
3474503	3480768	There are free pets, um, cataclysm, uh, stuff.
3481709	3483230	There's also a, uh,
3484907	3486568	A demo of StarCraft 2.
3488389	3492332	And a few StarCraft 2 lithos and some goodies.
3492352	3492892	Lots of goodies.
3492953	3493433	Lots of stuff.
3493553	3494033	What do I have to do?
3494093	3495354	Just send in a name?
3495734	3498536	You have to go to Infamous.net and click on the contest link.
3498937	3502199	And it's, again, N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.
3503440	3504780	And click on the Blizzard contest.
3505381	3506101	Follow the directions.
3506361	3510884	You just basically have to fill out your information and let them know what you're looking most forward to for Cataclysm.
3511285	3512426	Which, you know what my response was?
3513246	3513566	Nothing.
3515027	3522012	Except maybe Plants vs. Zombies, but I don't play World of Warcraft, so... You've been tempted to go back a couple times, though.
3522052	3523272	I have been.
3523312	3524613	Don't make me go find the timescales.
3524693	3526895	Just because Tiara told me that leveling is faster now.
3527415	3527675	It is.
3528176	3529396	And in Cataclysm it's going to be even better.
3529556	3532738	I hated leveling in freaking World of Warcraft.
3532778	3533579	Boo-hoo.
3533799	3534059	Alright.
3534560	3535400	I'm just messing.
3535560	3539343	Star Trek Online is much more fun because I can kill Borg and play with Klingons.
3540583	3541504	How's that working out for you?
3542567	3543708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3572441	3574923	Alright, well, this might be a new record, guys.
3574943	3577406	We're an hour into the show and we have yet to touch gaming news.
3577466	3577926	Woohoo!
3578667	3581129	That's alright, so we're going to kind of quickly move through some gaming news tonight.
3581810	3582851	Loki, why don't you start us off?
3583351	3587035	Some gaming news, if you can get away from the MacGyver stuff for a moment.
3587075	3587375	I don't know.
3587475	3588156	I got the work, by the way.
3589237	3589617	Of course.
3590557	3591378	I'm awesome like that.
3592138	3600604	Xbox.com has gotten a makeover to kind of update everything with the new dashboard updates coming soon and whatnot.
3600684	3609689	They've added avatar editors on the actual website, so now you don't have to wait until you get to your console to make your avatar look neat.
3611310	3615253	Also, apparently, they're going to add some multiplayer web games, which...
3617074	3618256	That's cool, I guess.
3618677	3621261	I don't know if it's going to be some more stuff that you can...
3624207	3628949	If it's going to tie in with different games, like how they did with Crackdown and Facebook games and stuff, perhaps.
3629309	3635992	But right now they're saying that they're going to be able to play web games with your Xbox Live friends on the web or on Windows Phone 7.
3637533	3639974	And I'm sure those will be fun.
3641835	3647537	And this is all, of course, this already came out this week, so go check it out.
3649881	3651423	Are any of those free games available yet?
3651644	3652365	The web stuff?
3653066	3654107	They were just teasing them.
3655289	3659595	They haven't really made them available yet, but the Avatar editor's there, so you can check that out at least.
3659855	3661217	They'll be coming out soon.
3661237	3666204	Yeah, I'm glad that they actually updated the website because there's a lot of stuff that's broken on there.
3667321	3669503	You know, links to games and stuff.
3669543	3672387	You're like, okay, I want to look up stuff about Crackdown 2.
3672547	3674028	Okay, that page doesn't exist.
3674148	3677092	Well, when was the last time they changed the look of the page?
3677112	3680015	I think it was even before the new Xbox experience.
3680155	3684159	I think it was before the Xbox 360 launch.
3684319	3686001	No, I want to say they did change it with the 360.
3689144	3700793	I mean, it seems that they're doing this... This was more in line with the Windows phone and all that, and they're trying to integrate... Yeah, they're really pushing this Windows phone.
3700813	3704996	They're really pushing the phone because, you know, let's face it, they're a competitor.
3705416	3705616	Yeah.
3706497	3733243	well and let's also not forget that there's some stories this week about how AT&T is really starting to get behind these phones because the rumors are starting to snowball a little more that they are going Verizon with the iPhone in 2011 and so AT&T is actually going to start pushing a lot more of the Windows phone I mean not to say they're not going to sell the iPhone anymore but they're going to also be pushing the Windows phones diversify the portfolio exactly exactly
3733903	3737904	So it'll be interesting to see if there's any truth to these so-called rumors.
3738124	3751428	I will say about this with the Xbox.com site that I wish Sony would do is when you hear about a game that's available as a downloadable service...
3752228	3763159	At least with Xbox, if you're at work and you hear about it, you can buy it on the site and you don't have to be at your Xbox and you can make that purchase or say, okay, I want the demo.
3763859	3772348	So then when you get back to your Xbox, it'll be downloaded waiting for you and remind you that you wanted to look at the thing and play it.
3772694	3776095	There's also just a lot more content on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
3776115	3780016	There's always at least a couple games coming out each week versus Sony.
3780476	3782357	There may be a game coming out that week.
3782417	3783917	It's not consistent.
3784297	3792839	Unless you count their old PlayStation 1 classics that they're putting out.
3793560	3801702	Really, for the both of them, Xbox needs to make their indie game service or whatever community games they're calling it now.
3802162	3802723	Showcased
3816573	3822517	Yes, exactly, because with the App Store, it's easy to spend money like crazy on that thing.
3822937	3836826	And if they made it more like that and had like, okay, hey, look, this feature now has weather updates, and this app does this and this, I think that would be beneficial for them, especially since they don't have a web browser.
3838738	3843785	Alright, well, I will say, though, one thing about the website, one thing I tried to look up was the Game Room website.
3844265	3844946	Yeah, it wasn't there.
3846228	3847309	I had to do a search for it.
3848992	3852736	Something not pretty is going on with Game Room, I'm sorry to say, but we'll see.
3853377	3854979	Just to kind of follow up a little bit from last week.
3855640	3856401	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
3885119	3889142	Diablo 3's latest class, the Demon Hunter, is revealed.
3889182	3891644	And that is supposedly the last class that's going to be in the game.
3892484	3894426	Also, PvP battle arenas.
3894486	3895426	That does sound kind of cool.
3895466	3897208	That is also coming to Diablo 3.
3897468	3898508	Those are some of the big announcements.
3898889	3900970	One thing that was missing, though, was when.
3901571	3903292	Not even a hint of a quarter.
3903952	3905774	Cataclysm is coming out on December 7th
3925953	3926093	Addicts!
3926193	3926474	Addicts!
3951036	3953299	I love them, but they're addicts and suckers
3967917	3970519	StarCraft 2 is going to be getting some scenarios for it.
3971139	3973061	One of them is a Defense of the Ancients scenario.
3973421	3979966	Also, Bejeweled and Left 4 Dead, some other interesting little versions of those in StarCraft 2.
3980547	3985230	But I find the Defense of the Ancients one the most interesting because Valve, of course, has their Defense of the Ancients game.
3985571	3990615	They actually got the people who originally did the mod now work at Valve, but yet Blizzard is now going to make their own...
3991255	3991975	Very interesting.
3992055	3998738	So you're going to have StarCraft or what they're calling Blizzard Defense of the Ancients is going to be coming to StarCraft 2 soon.
3999278	4000139	Again, no date there.
4001279	4002700	So yep, folks went to BlizzCon.
4002860	4004560	Some guy broke his leg while dancing.
4004840	4005901	Tenacious D played.
4006281	4006781	People spent $150.
4007922	4009442	Hope you guys found it worth it.
4009822	4012343	I really don't have any interest.
4012403	4015345	As much as I'm an addict and war program, I have no interest in BlizzCon.
4015385	4015685	It's also $150.
4015725	4016025	What's that, Seg?
4019278	4022640	Ultimate Band Package for Oomloud on sale November 1st.
4023720	4026741	And I tell you, that's probably more exciting than... That's probably a better deal.
4026841	4030383	And that's what I'm... Honestly, you guys... Maybe you can't say this year.
4030403	4032864	Are you guys doing the swag bag again for the Ultimate Bands this year?
4032944	4033384	Oh, yeah.
4033665	4034865	I mean, we don't know what's going to be in it.
4035625	4037146	But we're going to do a bag.
4037346	4040187	You're probably going to get better shit in those bags than you do in the BlizzCon bags.
4040448	4042448	I think the BlizzCon bags... I can say that, too.
4042689	4043509	You'll get better stuff.
4044530	4046351	Did they even get a pet this year in the BlizzCon?
4046371	4048673	Yeah, they got another... It was another Murloc, I think.
4049673	4051195	Yeah, that's it.
4052035	4053776	It was a Deathwing Murloc, I think.
4053817	4054597	There's so many.
4054657	4055158	Was that correct?
4055198	4056198	That's part of the giveaway.
4056338	4057019	There's so many.
4057039	4062963	Then go win one off Infamous Gamers and don't spend $150 to get a swag bag.
4063123	4070909	I actually looked at the live blog for it and I was like, so they announced a new class for Diablo and that was it?
4071670	4071830	That...
4072384	4072464	Yes.
4099185	4099545	Exactly.
4099565	4103508	By simple math, we have deduced that it is December 7th.
4103828	4104088	Alright.
4104528	4107930	So anyhow, yeah, that's what went on at BlizzCon.
4108191	4115235	Otherwise, you had angry gamers asking questions and raging in the microphone at BlizzDevelopers because everybody's so mature.
4115915	4117836	You know, so that's all the stuff you missed.
4118977	4125787	I tried to get people on Twitter to, if they were, I'm like, if you're gonna rage question, then at least rage question about real ID.
4125867	4131594	Do something that actually affects your real life instead of like, stop nerfing my paladin.
4131634	4132155	Yeah.
4134656	4139899	But I will say, if I may, since I am a Warcraft player and I'm teasing myself here a little bit.
4140059	4140419	You may.
4140719	4149784	That new patch that Blizzard did, although I really like some of the features and some of the changes they did, boy, did they screw some things up.
4150024	4156688	They have this bug in there right now where an icon turning into a certain shape will crash the entire game.
4156988	4158129	It's called the Cogwheel bug.
4158529	4162351	And what's great about it is that for the Halloween event, in order to summon the Halloween boss...
4163035	4182797	You gotta click the cogwheel on the headless horseman thing, the pumpkin So pretty much everybody crashes out They've been able to fix it with a third party fix that's available on Curse But yeah, Blizzard's too busy throwing their party to really be on top of that right now Maybe I won't go back and play it
4184334	4190639	This new patch needed a little more testing, but Blizzard really wanted that game out this year, so whatever.
4190839	4198064	At least it's not as much of a hot mess as another certain MMO that came out and they had to extend the trial period of the game because it was so terrible.
4198704	4200645	But anyhow, I'm not going to go there again for another week.
4200725	4205128	Alright, if you don't understand, Rob, it still is the trial part of the game.
4205669	4208651	It will be the trial part of the game for the next few years.
4209062	4209763	I'll stick with Final Fantasy XI
4226215	4230558	Final Fantasy XIV, that's right, that's the game that sucks.
4230618	4232239	Final Fantasy XIV is fucking terrible.
4232259	4233060	It's terrible.
4233080	4233980	I can't hold it in anymore.
4234000	4235181	It blows.
4235401	4236702	It's a brand new game.
4236802	4240044	We have the same races, but we named them something more ridiculous.
4240464	4241765	And it sucks worse.
4242005	4245968	Although I do remember one MMO that I played that was in beta for like seven years.
4246909	4247329	Ragnarok?
4247349	4248130	Ragnarok.
4249550	4253173	And I played through the whole thing in several different languages.
4253919	4256580	Well, they better not hear you talking smack on our show or we ban you!
4256880	4257400	I love Ragnarok.
4257420	4257840	Permanently.
4258020	4263662	You know, this must be... My account can't be banned on Ragnarok, even though I don't play anymore on the IRO server.
4264062	4264542	Who'd you blow?
4264642	4266422	Because I was a beta tester.
4266863	4273424	All the beta accounts that played for the PvP testing got to keep their accounts.
4273764	4274285	That's good to know.
4274765	4274925	Yeah.
4275265	4275745	All right.
4275885	4282047	It must be a key to my personality, but the only MMO I've actually played with some length was Myst Online.
4283553	4285094	Mist Online was kind of creepy.
4285314	4287014	Mist Online was a great idea.
4287534	4290655	And, man, Zombie Game refused to die.
4291896	4294157	I mean, that game got relaunched about four times.
4295917	4298078	And it was great, it just needed...
4300459	4304321	There were just things that hung it up on interface-wise.
4306082	4310484	And narrative-based MMO, that's a huge beast to fill.
4311925	4315087	Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
4315667	4321810	TigerClaw says, talking about BlizzCon, one fan complained about the WoW characters looking like they came from Victoria's Secrets.
4322891	4325653	The developer replied, what magazine do you want them to look like?
4325673	4326393	Yeah.
4327253	4353748	Penthouse Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat says all the WoW players moved on to a better game Hello Kitty Island Adventures you know what's funny is that we were at Target the other day and there was Final Fantasy 14 sitting on the shelf and Alan's like you should buy that he's like hey you should buy that you should buy that I'm like I will buy this before I buy that and I pointed at Hello Kitty online you know that Hello Kitty is getting her first Wii game coming in November no one cur alright what
4356105	4362871	I remember me picking up a certain Bats Maru Hello Kitty game and Rob going, Oh girl, I want to play that!
4364012	4365213	And me lending it to him.
4365274	4367796	Says the person that has the Hello Kitty toaster.
4367936	4371379	I deny these allegations, all of them.
4371479	4372520	And a Hello Kitty TV.
4372820	4373361	Hold on.
4374201	4376103	Actually, it was a Disney Princess TV for wine.
4376123	4376864	Oh, I'm sorry.
4377224	4378165	That's much better.
4378305	4379786	I gave it to a seven-year-old girl.
4380607	4385251	and the Hello Kitty coffee maker is no more.
4386232	4386652	It's gone.
4386692	4387953	I got a real coffee maker.
4388694	4388934	I know.
4389434	4390015	All right, anyhow.
4390435	4391196	You know what, Rob?
4391276	4393878	If you really want to be cool, you'll just get a French press.
4396159	4396640	Rob Blinks.
4398243	4400384	Moving on with more gaming news, DarkSakura.
4424489	4425890	We will see them in early 2011.
4427852	4432657	And... The good thing about Space Channel 5 Part 2 is that we never got it in North America.
4432697	4433878	So this means we get to play it.
4433918	4436760	Like, there's really a whole bunch of Japanese in it to change.
4437521	4440964	I mean... Didn't we get... We got it on PlayStation 2 version, didn't we?
4441605	4442686	Yeah, I think so.
4442826	4443246	I don't know.
4443286	4444287	I've got the Japanese one.
4445348	4448351	With that freaking hard one where it does all the stuff and you have to do it backwards.
4448551	4448991	Oh my god.
4449352	4449612	Anyway...
4451233	4453675	So yeah, but it's a Mizuguchi game.
4453715	4454535	It's really fun.
4454655	4457037	Space Channel 5, really, really like it.
4457057	4458838	And I love Space Channel 5 Part 2.
4460219	4461700	Mainly because of the thriller dance.
4462520	4464722	The whole section where they do just Michael Jackson dances.
4465082	4467343	And Pudding is especially fierce in Part 2.
4467683	4468404	I'm Pudding!
4471126	4472586	She's my favorite, just for the record.
4472706	4473667	Pudding is my favorite character.
4473707	4475448	And Shermie has left the studio.
4476289	4477810	You notice she did not step on your laptop.
4478570	4479130	She's good that way.
4479150	4479651	Good kitty.
4479891	4479971	Yeah.
4481539	4483260	Alright, crushed his laptop.
4484540	4490223	She is not that huge, and she knows better than to step on laptops because we got on door.
4490463	4491523	She'll get a kitty spanking.
4492263	4492824	Alright, moving on.
4492844	4493384	She likes it.
4493604	4494444	More gaming news.
4494464	4496025	Shermie does like spankings, by the way.
4497746	4498526	We don't need to know that.
4499126	4500127	Family show!
4500927	4503068	Yeah, right.
4503208	4504368	Fuck family shows!
4504969	4508350	If you pet her on her lower back, she'll stick her butt up in the air and start purring.
4509901	4511223	I don't need to know what your cat's into.
4511264	4514429	Does your cat want a leather harness for Christmas?
4514569	4515431	No, she's not into that.
4515831	4516633	I'm sorry, your Hanukkah?
4517695	4518957	My cat's not Jewish.
4519197	4519999	She's agnostic.
4524078	4541802	Apparently, Ubisoft is recalling Sean White's skateboarding on the PlayStation 3, which means I'm going to have a lot of fucking work to do tomorrow because they've already shipped them all to us so that we got them to our customers, so we're going to have to do a bunch of fucking returns on it.
4542162	4548424	But apparently, and this was coming from some big-name retailers, they're saying that there's issues with...
4549204	4556429	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4581720	4583943	Thanks for all the work, you fucking dumbasses.
4585105	4586927	No, we printed it wrong!
4589611	4591633	Well, now, Loki, mistakes happen.
4591894	4592594	Yeah!
4594755	4595115	Whatever.
4596516	4602399	Was there some Arab song in this that someone got offended about, you know, playing the beta or something, like LittleBigPlanet?
4603079	4604260	I did get one of those copies.
4605040	4606101	Really, it was stupid.
4606581	4608042	I liked it better with the lyrics in the game.
4611056	4613818	I think Sean White skateboarding isn't intentionally supposed to be that bad.
4613838	4615939	Is this a big title?
4615959	4616179	No.
4616339	4619161	How many people buy this game?
4619201	4621082	Most people are like, Sean White?
4621482	4622423	Who the fuck's he?
4622443	4624724	Isn't that the snowboarder?
4624764	4626125	Isn't that the guy that looks like Carrot Top?
4626305	4628006	Yes, it is the guy that looks like Carrot Top.
4628487	4629807	I know who it is.
4629987	4635951	He actually skateboards, but Tony Hawk has a game coming out, Tony Hawk Shred, and as far as I'm aware, Tony Hawk does not fucking snowboard.
4637872	4638613	He's a poser.
4639513	4640694	I don't know, that game is terrible.
4640954	4641974	Not the Sean White game.
4641994	4645256	Sean White game's decent, but Tony Hawk's terrible.
4645296	4654759	Well, if Shaquille O'Neal can do everything, like, you know, he had that whole TV show about Shaquille O'Neal does this and that, then, you know, why can't Tony Hawk decide to... And they're doing comic-style art of him.
4655639	4656259	Shaquille O'Neal?
4656740	4659481	And, because, with the new Celtics lineup.
4660381	4665163	But you can listen to Infamous.net's Comic Insanity for that.
4665783	4666203	Plug, plug.
4666995	4669158	Salacious Pop is bringing us some lols in chat.
4670400	4672322	Has anyone actually seen Sean White?
4672382	4675587	What he needs is a line of shampoo and hair care, not video games.
4676988	4684939	Also, Salacious Pop mentioning Shermie was walking out and Salacious Pop was suggesting talk about the Sony move so she'll poop in the hall.
4686079	4686660	She does that.
4686740	4689703	Every time we bring it up, she goes out in the hall and takes a big crap.
4689783	4690604	I've got something better.
4691645	4697532	I noticed when I was in the Sony Marketplace this weekend that there is a preview download for... Is Shermie listening?
4697832	4702237	Shermie, The Tester Season 2 has a preview trailer available.
4702257	4705320	Do not get my cat to take a crap because guess who has to clean that shit up?
4706461	4706822	Me!
4707983	4708463	Literally.
4709424	4711846	The Tester Season 2, Shermie.
4712066	4715949	And again, disclaimer, my cat is old and fat and can't get to the bathroom easily.
4716610	4716970	Alright.
4720133	4721094	She's fat and sassy.
4721383	4725205	Let's talk about something else that's going to be very sassy, at least for fans of these series.
4725225	4726686	As long as it doesn't involve cat shit.
4726847	4727607	No, it doesn't involve that.
4728488	4732450	Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright are going to be colliding.
4732530	4735752	Worlds are colliding in a new 3DS adventure.
4736072	4740755	What I love about this is that these are like two very culty kind of games on the DS.
4740835	4744017	Like either you play them and you love them or you're like, what is this?
4744137	4744778	I don't even know.
4745518	4749021	So somehow, and of course I'm looking at this going...
4749901	4751642	How does this even work?
4751822	4754543	How do these two games even... Alright, whatever.
4754583	4755463	Did you watch the trailer?
4756304	4757744	I didn't, to be honest.
4758105	4760065	Oh, no, the Japanese trailer is out.
4761726	4764007	Yeah, there's actually a good high-res one out.
4764807	4765247	Oh, is there?
4765308	4766628	Yeah.
4767508	4768609	But it was really cool.
4768989	4772430	I sat and watched the whole thing going, I can only understand half of this.
4773111	4775412	Well, and it's going to be on the 3DS, and that's kind of awesome.
4775432	4778353	That's the noise you hear in the background, by the way, is a little bit of the trailer, but that's like
4778533	4779814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4796390	4796750	I don't know.
4797271	4799174	Are they biting a little bit from the other puzzle game?
4801257	4803500	The whole FBI investigation.
4803520	4804822	This is starting to sound a little familiar.
4805443	4808367	You might want to look into exploring a lawsuit on this.
4808387	4808808	I don't know.
4808868	4809369	No, no, no.
4809389	4809729	This is...
4811924	4813705	I'm just starting crap.
4814206	4815607	I'm excited for it.
4817409	4825737	It's the kind of thing of like, this can go horribly, horribly wrong, but there's a chance that it can go horribly, horribly right.
4825937	4829120	But it'll be in 3D!
4829180	4835526	But seriously though, I wait in eager anticipation to what this turns out.
4835966	4837447	I haven't read up on it or anything.
4837727	4840248	I don't think they even publish much to anything.
4841088	4843929	And it's probably in Japanese and I'm a gaijin.
4846310	4847230	That's the right word, right?
4847951	4850672	Well, if you were in Japan, then yeah, you'd be gaijin.
4850812	4851032	Okay.
4851713	4852473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4869869	4874710	I love this way it's described here by Level 5 President Akihiro Hino.
4875090	4878471	Quote, two TV shows getting together and making a movie.
4879051	4881052	So it's like Facts of Life meets Golden Girls.
4881412	4883632	There's gotta be tons of cinematics from what they show.
4883652	4884893	The trailer was long.
4885693	4886773	I mean, really long.
4888074	4890794	Well, I bet that's gonna be pretty awesome, actually.
4891454	4891874	Very cool.
4891974	4894075	DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get into release dates?
4895133	4896854	Something that's even better than Sonic 4.
4898174	4899974	And you know how we feel about Sonic 4.
4902155	4902935	I mean, aw.
4903975	4904215	Okay.
4907036	4913277	There are a group of Sonic fans, actually two people that brought out something called Sonic Fan Remix.
4914157	4916878	That is actually absolutely gorgeous.
4916978	4918018	I played it before the show.
4918999	4920619	And didn't you think it was...
4922310	4922910	It was pretty.
4923270	4923731	It was pretty.
4924011	4924511	Very pretty.
4925011	4928953	It's got different mechanics from different Sonic games thrown in, except for the dash thing.
4929233	4930513	It looks gorgeous.
4931293	4945239	I really think that... Now, one thing that I did notice when reading up on this is that they actually brought in tons of elements from Sonic CD, which that's really how it felt to me, playing like it is playing Sonic CD.
4945259	4946199	Yeah.
4947728	4951650	But, uh, they're doing so much of a better job than what Sega's doing.
4951690	4955212	I mean, Sega should just be like, hey, um, we like you.
4956012	4960395	But the people that are doing it is Pelican13 and Mercury.
4960895	4962796	The demo is out to download.
4963316	4967639	Um, you can go to, uh, Sonic Retro and find it.
4967699	4973862	They also do have a direct, uh, let me get the link for it real quick, because there actually is a direct, uh,
4975782	4976642	SONICFANREMIX.COM SONICFANREMIX.COM
5005515	5006678	And then they'll file a lawsuit.
5007640	5010526	Seriously, Rob, bring up the trailer.
5010546	5012570	Play some of the music because the music is gorgeous.
5012831	5013152	Sure.
5013352	5015076	Let me bring that up here from the website.
5015096	5015577	What did you think?
5017132	5044854	yeah my only you know I didn't I was just looking over your shoulder for it but definitely the backgrounds are sort of like too busy and it kind of illustrates how they're really going to 11 with the art like hey look what we're doing and gets a little too just on the edge of showboating with it yeah but not stupid it's noticeable but it's not stupid it's not completely deprimental to the game itself
5045410	5046570	I think it'd be something to get used to.
5050892	5051132	Hmm.
5051672	5052433	Very pretty looking.
5053213	5054874	I love some of the interactive backgrounds.
5054914	5058015	Even though, yeah, the multi-layered background thing can get a little busy.
5058475	5059375	But it kind of detracts.
5059435	5061036	I really love some of what they did with it.
5062757	5063197	Looks hot.
5063977	5065858	I like it when it gets into my favorite part of this music.
5066978	5067378	Kudos.
5067678	5068439	Oh, which was next.
5068519	5069099	Oh, I'm sorry.
5069199	5069599	It's okay.
5070600	5071040	There you go.
5075226	5078335	I love that little shark thing that jumps out as he's running over the bridge.
5078355	5079418	It's like a big killer whale, I think.
5079498	5081323	Little touches like that are awesome.
5081853	5086016	and it even knocks the blocks or all that same checkerboard pattern all around it.
5086116	5087056	It's pretty fantastic.
5087857	5096142	I'd have to say that this is an epic job and I hope it doesn't get shut down the way that the Chrono Trigger thing was because that was also awesome.
5096362	5098444	Well, Burr apparently has been following this pretty closely.
5098524	5105728	He has a follow-up comment here in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com The people on the forum about it say Sega won't do anything about it.
5105808	5107509	Not sure why they're so confident.
5108190	5108330	Hmm.
5109634	5110014	Interesting.
5110815	5112495	All right, well, definitely worth checking out.
5112555	5114396	Grab it now until it becomes a problem.
5114816	5115757	That's my suggestion.
5116137	5117878	All right, let's go get some release dates.
5118218	5131544	So, Loki, I know there's a lot this week, but I just want to point out we're already at an hour and a half for Part A. In other words, if we cut out the Hello Kitty games, I think we'll be okay.
5131564	5132644	Don't worry, I won't read any Hello Kitty games.
5132664	5133685	I need more Hello Kitty!
5135443	5164254	Sean White skateboarding actually came out today on Xbox 360 and we were disavowing any knowledge of the PS3 version because that's it's not yet ready the re-release of Dragon Age Origins the Ultimate Edition it's packed with all the download content including the expansion Awakenings and you can get that this week Family Party 90 Great Games Party Pack that is also a compilation of the last three Family Party games I'm sure 90 awesome games

5186470	5188272	The N-Strike Double Blast Bundle.
5188492	5191574	It's with a gun in the two last Nerf N-Strike games.

5193475	5197558	Cabela's Dangerous Hunt 11 with the wireless shotgun.
5198419	5199299	The top shotgun.
5199800	5203943	And that's on Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
5204143	5206745	The Wii has a gun shell that goes with it, but
5207285	5207906	Same type of thing.
5208006	5210971	Also the game is available by itself on those three platforms as well.

5277284	5278224	Well, we should try harder.
5278245	5279225	Just kidding.
5279365	5280426	Have you ever played one?
5280446	5281466	I don't watch CSI.
5281506	5285968	See, if it was Law and Order, it was Law and Order.
5286289	5287169	Don't worry, I got your back.
5287849	5288270	Thanks, Rob.
5288530	5294072	Tony Hawk Shred coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and we just don't buy it, seriously.
5294653	5297894	It's one of those games that requires a stupid skateboard to play.
5298355	5299995	You know what that really should be?
5300456	5301856	Skateboarding outside.
5301936	5305538	Because if you have to buy a skateboard to play a game, you should just skateboard.
5306159	5306459	Done.
5307619	5309380	Halo... That'd be funny.
5309400	5309940	This was Halo.

5318224	5322466	No, Hasbro Family Game Night 3 coming out on the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
5324166	5325207	Some more games with that.
5326966	5335969	Okay, and I doubt that this is coming out on this date because why would you release this a good week early, but who knows.
5336309	5341631	Fighters Uncaged, I believe that's supposed to be coming out in a couple weeks, but that's the fighting game for the Kinect.
5342091	5343572	That's of course on Xbox 360.

5364248	5369052	They're releasing a complete edition with both Grand Theft Auto 4 and Episodes of Liberty City, all for $39.99.
5369092	5373977	The fights lights out on PlayStation 3.
5374197	5375839	That is the Move fighting game.

5384606	5385367	Oh, I've heard of that one.
5387228	5401454	Monopoly Streets on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii on I believe DS and PSP, Pet's Nursery 2 on DS, and Lego Universe on PC.
5401755	5402515	That should be pretty big.
5402715	5403815	Oh, that's the MMO, huh?
5403855	5405636	Yeah, that is the awesome MMO.
5406176	5408457	I haven't even heard a darn thing about that game, actually.
5408497	5409458	I'm kind of curious now.
5410891	5412072	Mama is doing everything.
5412132	5413233	Now she's crafting.

5748737	5749677	I like Robbie Williams.
5749757	5754099	Like, I know he's not a big deal here in the US, but he's pretty big everywhere else.
5754359	5754760	Yeah.
5754780	5756480	I can see why he's getting his own karaoke game.
5757481	5757781	All right.
5758941	5760742	Let's move on to some more news.
5761022	5763784	And then the classic game of the week is just a few steps away.
5764284	5764464	Loki.
5764875	5768118	Oh yeah, so this is kind of interesting.
5768899	5788776	Apparently, and I actually saw this on the news, which is kind of weird, but there was a lot of, or it was, I guess, brought up by the Wall Street Journal that there was a bunch of Facebook applications actually transmitting user IDs and other information, I guess, to third-party advertisers.
5789777	5799419	And of those applications, I guess, some of them were created by Zynga, including FarmVille.
5800200	5809262	Apparently, the three of the top ten applications, FarmVille had been transmitting personal information about users' friends to outside companies.
5809782	5838070	of course your user ID is publicly available and is by itself just a number however this data can be and as apparently the Wall Street Journal reports is being shared with other parties specifically wait wait a minute wait a minute you mean to tell me that Zynga the makers of that free Farmville game and all these other free games that they knocked off from other companies you mean Zynga the company that's been called pure evil by many people on the internet
5838690	5841231	They've been raping my privacy this whole time.
5842211	5842831	I know.
5842851	5843531	Who would have thought?
5843551	5844512	Come on.
5844852	5846112	You're lying.
5846232	5859415	If I understand it correctly, it wasn't that they're like, hey, here it is, but more of being able to access that data from other sites.
5860215	5863496	So, you know, the embedded ads.
5863556	5865517	It wasn't just like, here you go.
5865537	5865577	No.
5867137	5867557	Please!
5867617	5868918	Take it!
5870138	5877621	It was just playing those games made that stuff more accessible to be grabbed and they took advantage of that.
5877681	5880042	So wait, Amazon.com might know I'm gay?
5881643	5884524	Because I've played Farmville once in my life?
5884784	5887086	I think you have terrible taste in games, apparently.
5887686	5889167	Gosh.
5889307	5895711	I wondered why it keeps trying to sell me Will & Grace, even Season 7, and Funny Girl on Blu-ray.
5895771	5897292	I just couldn't figure that out.
5899314	5904357	And because of this whole leak or whatever, of course, what's going to happen?
5904797	5909260	Some lawyers are going to catch wind of this, and they're going to file a class action lawsuit.
5909841	5910901	And that's what they did.
5911342	5911942	Apparently...
5914073	5915454	because it's the American way.
5915734	5917055	We're going to sue you about it.
5917095	5927101	Apparently, law firm Edelson McGuire filed a suit with San Francisco Federal Court, I guess by St.
5927141	5930103	Paul, Minnesota resident Nancy Graff.
5930423	5937188	They're seeking monetary relief for those whose data was wrongly shared and injunction relief to prevent continued privacy abuses.
5938429	5952019	No specific amount was mentioned regarding the extent of aforementioned monetary relief, but seeing as how the announcement claims the leak has affected 218 million Facebook users, we're guessing the damages will be significant.
5953280	5955762	Or sought will be significant, not necessarily what they get.
5958786	5959126	I don't know.
5959927	5969114	I would say that's not too uncharacteristic for that company, but that sucks, I guess, if you're into Farmville.
5969155	5977421	But honestly, with Facebook and stuff, a lot of your information is just kind of out there anyways, even if you're turning on your privacy settings and stuff like that.
5978482	5996875	I just love though how, you know, this couldn't be timed any better because it always seems like, you know, that guy, that bro that runs Facebooks is like a billionaire, is always getting up on stage going, hey, you know, guys, we're really working on the privacy thing and, you know, we want your information to be secure and information and your security is our number one priority.
5997275	6003279	And then, you know, it comes out like literally the next day, like Farm Bill is selling your information to the devil.
6003719	6004060	Yeah.
6006168	6008297	Facebook creator is actually devil.
6011989	6022571	Alright, yeah, so Didn't we already went through this debate with web browser cookies, which is essentially what's happening only it's a different avenue?
6022591	6041295	It's a super cookie It's a super cookie Delicious But it just seems like all it is is like, okay, we know this is a unique user, and yes, attached to Facebook, but it's not I'm not dismissing the issue, just trying to get more clarity on what the issue is
6042015	6045978	It just seems like it's the same thing as the cookie of like, okay, unique user.
6046038	6057745	But what knocked it up the next level is that this number, which was first just like, okay, plant there, this number we generate so it can keep a unique ID.
6058025	6064129	This time it's more persistent because it's attached to your Facebook profile and et cetera, et cetera.
6064429	6067830	And so anything you post on Facebook might be publicly accessible.
6067930	6069590	So, you know, lesson learned.
6069610	6077112	If you're going to use a site like Facebook, make sure, you know, if you don't want to get it out there, don't post it or lock it down.
6077472	6082133	Even if you're locked down to private, like my Facebook is locked down so only friends of mine can see it.
6082193	6085574	And even then, there's some things I just don't post on Facebook.
6086114	6088215	You know, Rob, there is a good use of Facebook.
6088255	6088615	What's that?
6089695	6093156	Like Umlaut on Facebook.com slash Umlaut.
6094059	6097103	Yes!
6097443	6099726	You had all these plugs written down on a sheet of paper.
6099746	6100768	Wait till we get to Twitter.
6100948	6103371	It's like you're playing a game.
6103651	6104813	Which is at Umlaut.
6106989	6107649	While we're at it.
6108990	6109330	All right.
6110270	6111871	Anyhow, quickly here.
6112331	6114012	You won't be able to find Rock Band on here.
6114092	6114952	Sorry, you loud fans.
6115012	6121435	But one thing you will be able to find is a brand new Games for Windows Marketplace with lots of new stuff, I guess.
6121895	6125317	November 15th is when the new Games for Windows Marketplace launches.
6125337	6125757	Because, you know...
6126477	6142161	Right now, when you think about, how can I download PC games on my computer, you usually think about, I don't know, Steam is one of the big ones, or maybe Direct to Drive, or even maybe that good old game site that had that big old joke, ha ha, we're shutting down, no wait, we aren't, I think a few weeks ago.
6142201	6144902	You don't usually think about, oh yeah, Games for Windows has their own marketplace.
6145422	6148164	Well, Microsoft's not happy with that, and they'd like to change their perception there.
6148224	6152906	So they are going to be beefing up their online portal with some more stuff.
6153947	6159450	It's all going to be branded with the whole Games for Windows Live, more competitive and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6159490	6163012	They want to make it a store, really a destination for PC gamers.
6163392	6166514	There's going to be stuff enabled through Live, all that good stuff.
6166534	6169636	So they're going to be revamping everything on November 15th.
6170457	6170977	So there you go.
6171918	6198138	and they're saying you should show up on day one because we're going to have a great pre-order on a title you may care about the speculation is that it's Fable 3 for the PC foreshadowing you know what though if they can match some of those sales that Steam is having you know what competition is not necessarily a bad thing because you know if they're going to try to one up Steam they're going to have to do so with some of the prices so we'll see exactly how that goes over
6199079	6214806	In the meantime, let's get to a segment we like to do here on the show where DarkSakura dips into the video game vault and says, Hey, you ungrateful kids with your desert bus events and your umlauts and stuff.
6214826	6215126	You know what?
6215146	6217207	You need to know where these games came from.
6217347	6219248	Get off my lawn and go play these games.
6219268	6220069	And while you're at it.
6220249	6220809	Yeah, that's right.
6220849	6220929	No.
6221730	6223011	We like to explore gaming's past.
6223031	6223471	Pull up your pants!
6225413	6226054	Buy a belt!
6226935	6232160	Alright, we're going to explore gaming's past by checking out the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
6232180	6233902	What is the classic game of the week from the vault this week?
6234122	6237305	I'm angry with myself for having never reviewed this one.
6238166	6238887	Sonic & Knuckles.
6239868	6242330	I've done Knuckles Chaotix, I've done other Sonic games.
6242630	6243952	Have not done Sonic & Knuckles.
6244112	6244853	What is wrong with me?
6245811	6249172	So this is something that Sega has done right.
6250153	6252574	And Rob, we have to start off with the noise.
6252594	6254214	We always have to start off with the noise.
6255475	6255775	Yes!
6258036	6258776	Best music ever.
6267449	6276155	Sonic & Knuckles, it came out on the Genesis, also known as the Mega Drive overseas, and it was actually developed in the U.S.
6277156	6280338	at the Sega Technical Institute by members of Sonic Team.
6281159	6288504	And it came out on October 18th, 1994, which was, guess what, the year I graduated high school!
6288864	6290085	Woo!
6291125	6291946	You're older than me.
6292446	6293247	Bite my butt, Robb.
6294684	6295404	I'm Vintage.
6296124	6296565	Shut up.
6297865	6303966	Anyway, this was a, uh, you could play it by itself, and it also locked on to Sonic 2 and Sonic 3.
6305227	6311808	The game was actually developed with Sonic 2 and Sonic 3, so that's why it's got all the special little nummy goodies in it.
6312628	6314709	Almost as delicious as these peanut butter cookies.
6316351	6317492	So you've got different stories.
6317592	6322095	It actually picks up from the end of Sonic 3 after the Death Egg crashes.
6323476	6327039	Which, by the way, Rob, I was playing Bayonetta and I got that they were calling that dude Eggman.
6328080	6331162	Because that was Robotnik's name and the Japanese version was Eggman.
6331442	6331702	Anyway.
6332523	6332603	Um...
6334564	6340369	And so you have to go get the Chaos Emeralds and the Super Emeralds and all the stuff and be super awesome.
6341630	6344893	And if you get all of them, you turn into Super Sonic.
6345113	6345774	Yay!
6345914	6347255	And you can go to the Doomsday Zone.
6347535	6348356	Yay!
6348856	6350818	And then you can blow up the machine.
6351318	6351939	Yay!
6352119	6353340	And return the Master Emerald.
6353821	6356303	Which leads right into Sonic Adventure!
6356323	6356383	Yay!
6357526	6358527	Ooh.
6359267	6361929	Because the island crashes back down in Sonic Adventure.
6362829	6364530	And Knuckles is pissed off at Sonic.
6365291	6365751	Yeah, anyway.
6366492	6372756	And then you've got Knuckles' story, which everyone just beats up on him, and he's like, well, crap, I'm tired of getting you, so I'm gonna go get all these emeralds too.
6373816	6374797	And that's the Knuckles' story.
6375037	6376378	Don't you just love my paraphrasing?
6377876	6381039	As far as the way it plays, well, you can't use Tails.
6381980	6382260	Oops.
6383722	6389548	However, if you lock it on to Sonic 3, then you can play Tails.
6389568	6392391	I mean, you just lock it on.
6393312	6396755	It's got different bonus stages.
6396835	6401019	You've got ones where you collect 20 rings by walking through these bumpers.
6402220	6406664	And then you have the slot machines from Sonic 2, like in the Casino Night Zone.
6407825	6412830	And there's, of course, the labyrinth type thing.
6413570	6421893	And then there's also the magnetic orbs that you can use to move upwards and pick up shields and rings and lives and fun stuff.
6422893	6428975	It does not have a save slot in it unless you combine it with Sonic 3 to make it Sonic 3 and Knuckles.
6431076	6459298	so as far as other stuff in it again with Sonic 3 you can use Sonic 3 to play through as Knuckles lots of fun in Sonic 2 you can play Knuckles in Sonic 2 and you don't have to have as many rings for the little bonus zones and you can also if I remember right I think Knuckles has a lower ring no he can carry his rings over to the next stage instead of having to start over
6460118	6461940	So that was a big thing with that.
6461980	6463662	It was much easier to play through it with Knuckles.
6465824	6468287	God, I'm getting motion sickness just watching this bonus stage.
6468427	6468827	I know.
6469388	6474173	I could not do the bonus stages because I would get very motion sick.
6476315	6480900	And speaking of those little bonus stages now, if you tried to hook up...
6484083	6490727	The Sonic and Knuckles to Sonic the Hedgehog, you would get a screen with all the cast going, no way, no way, no way.
6492048	6504576	However, if you press a series of buttons, you can play the Blue Sphere game, a hundred different levels of it, and there's actually different levels depending on which game you do this with, because you can also do it with a bunch of other games.
6505696	6511100	But keep in mind, you will not be able to play Knuckles in, you know, Bionic Commando or something like that.
6511681	6512341	That just wouldn't work.
6512982	6515584	He'd fly everywhere and... That would be kind of awesome, though.
6515624	6516584	That would be kind of awesome.
6516624	6524070	Wasn't it, they weren't able to do it in Sonic 1 because Sonic's blue was also coded to, like, the sky or something like that?
6524630	6532316	And, like, if you, you know, they change the color on Sonic, you know, from blue to red, but then it's blood sky!
6532336	6532416	Yeah!
6534028	6535529	It's funny that you say that.
6536049	6538129	There's talking about hacks.
6538709	6545451	There was a game hack called Miles Tails Prower, which was, you know, Tails' name is Miles Prower, which I thought was always cute.
6548132	6554994	And then they did, the same group did one, it was a game basically to put Tails in Sonic the Hedgehog.
6555034	6558255	They also did Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog.
6558935	6577482	So instead of changing the palettes, because you're right, it did change the sky color, they actually lifted different colors of red from another part in the game and changed the socks to blue so that he didn't have to change the palette.
6579289	6581229	So that was pretty smart of them.
6581350	6598874	Another thing too about Sonic 2 with Knuckles is that for the longest time, because of that patch that they used to make the games work together, you couldn't find a ROM of Sonic 2 that you could play Knuckles in for the longest time.
6598994	6600514	They've since gotten around that.
6602304	6611990	So, as far as the releases, what was really great, and I remember this, because I was like, I want to do this!
6613311	6620435	Blockbuster Video and MTV had a tournament where people could play pre-release with the final one being at Alcatraz.
6620515	6621996	I don't know if anyone else remembers that.
6622877	6627920	But it was called MTV's Rock the Rock Warning.
6630385	6631946	Sadly, I think I do remember that.
6633787	6637909	It came out on Virtual Console, and it got a 9 from IGN.
6638009	6640670	And it was very cool.
6641771	6642051	Alright.
6642191	6643712	Your classic game of the week, folks!
6644372	6645833	Sonic and Knuckles.
6646593	6647994	I can't do this damn stage at all.
6648894	6650275	The bonus stages are evil.
6650595	6653677	I prefer... Oh, is he finally getting the Chaos Emerald?
6653697	6653937	Yes.
6654277	6655317	Yay!
6655517	6656398	You got a Chaos Emerald.
6659013	6659454	Alright.
6660415	6661596	There it is, the classic game of the week.
6662196	6662777	Enjoy that.
6663077	6664259	It's been a long time in the works.
6664299	6667982	Sonic & Knuckles there on the Sega Genesis or the Mega Drive, whichever you prefer.
6668002	6669304	What a good ending spot, too.
6669484	6670345	That was a good ending spot.
6671226	6676591	That was as good of a transition as Seg has plugs for his Umlaut tonight.
6677112	6679475	Which is all available at Umlaut.org, by the way.
6679575	6680035	See what I mean?
6682395	6685498	All right, we are going to take a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6685558	6688180	But don't go anywhere because when we come back, there will be plenty more.
6688520	6690142	We've got a lot, a lot of news to get through.
6690342	6696007	We're going to ask Seg a little more about charity-related things as well, kind of like how he started this whole charity thing in the first place.
6696027	6703854	We're going to kind of get into that, especially for those of you out there that might be thinking, hmm, I want to do a fundraiser too and go on radio show podcasts and work in plugs everywhere I can.
6703874	6705555	And be a mild internet celebrity.
6705575	6706076	There you go.
6706736	6709299	So on the internet D-list.
6710580	6715546	Not even the celebrity D-list, and then there's the internet D-list.
6716207	6718850	So Keyboard Cat would be on the B-list.
6719871	6720332	OLR.
6722544	6726366	D- That means we can hang out with Kathy Griffin.
6727486	6729007	No, she's on the celebrity D-list.
6729327	6731228	We would get to hang out with... Let's see.
6731488	6733949	Who would be on about the level of OLR?
6733989	6737810	I'm trying to think of internet celebrities that would be on about our level.
6739491	6748134	I'm thinking... See, even people like... Even like the kid in David Goes to the Dentist.
6748214	6750996	That's like the B-list or maybe even the A-list of the internet.
6752472	6754053	Could we hang out with a sassy gay friend?
6754874	6756555	Sassy gay friend's probably up there, too.
6756975	6760157	Maybe the what-what-in-the-butt guy, because that's been a few years.
6760958	6762259	We might be on about that level.
6763079	6765861	It's been a few years since he was popular, so... Okay.
6765921	6766241	Alright.
6769223	6770384	Alright, anyhow.
6770604	6773166	We're probably up there with Double Rainbow Guy, because he's kind of...
6775307	6780069	All joking aside, I wanted to read this real quick.
6780089	6783850	This is a comment in our chatroom from our pal Derek H, who is one of the hosts on Dead Pixel Live.
6783870	6785111	He's there weekdays at All Games Radio.
6785131	6786651	He hosts his own little shindig there.
6786671	6787151	It's a lot of fun.
6798535	6821903	sends us this link to a story on Slashdot about is Zynga trying to patent virtual currency since we were talking about Zynga and how some of their ethics may be questionable once in a while I thought this was kind of fascinating apparently a recent patent application was spotted by Zynga attempting to patent virtual currency purchased with real money for use in a gambling context
6822723	6828187	But I'm thinking, and this website's thinking as well, aren't there already plenty of ways that that exists?
6828227	6831450	Like, I don't know, Xbox 360 money?
6832250	6836814	Or, I mean, just a lot of MMOs out there you can buy money for.
6836854	6840436	But if they get the patent, then they have the patent.
6840456	6850243	But if they get it denied because of prior art or whatever ruling, then they can say, if someone else tries to claim it, they'll go, oh, no, no, no, no, we did, and the...
6851944	6854285	Patent Office said, oh, it can't be patented.
6854405	6857006	So maybe it's a move to protect themselves in the long run?
6857106	6857767	Yeah.
6857787	6861148	What do you think filing all these patents and all this news is for?
6861468	6862008	Interesting.
6862308	6862589	All right.
6862729	6863149	Fair enough.
6863289	6863629	Fair enough.
6864229	6867631	So we'll see what happens with that because, heaven forbid, they should be granted the patent.
6868091	6869091	Yeah.
6869491	6869911	But we'll see.
6870192	6870432	All right.
6870712	6873033	Anyhow, we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6873053	6873733	Don't go anywhere, guys.
6873773	6874213	Stay tuned.
6874233	6875854	We'll be back right after this.
6882692	6885253	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6885293	6894117	We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 24th of 2010, for the 387th episode of our little podcast here.
6894657	6895818	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6895838	6903441	Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at AllGames.com, where you just heard during the break there, if you were listening live, we can't put it on the podcast because it's copyright music.
6903781	6905102	We played some music from DJ Hero 2.
6905502	6907683	It kind of had the whole thing going live here in studio, though.
6907703	6908283	It was pretty awesome.
6908784	6911545	Also live in studio tonight, joining us, The Seg.
6912265	6917086	He is one of the co-founders of Umlaut, but he really hasn't talked a lot about it tonight.
6917206	6923368	And I've been coaxing him like, hey, if you show up to the show, you've got to try and drop a plug or two for what you're trying to sell.
6923408	6927649	You know, it's hard to get people to go to Umlaut.org and read all about our charity.
6927729	6927989	Yes.
6928590	6928890	All right.
6928950	6931530	So just try to work in a couple more plugs if you could.
6931710	6937232	You know, say, I just would hate for you to have wasted that tank of gas to get here and then just not talk about your charity event.
6937532	6938353	I know exactly.
6940174	6945598	It's really hard trying to get people even to follow our Twitter account, which is at umloud, U-M-L-O-U-D.
6946118	6946419	All right.
6946479	6946839	Good job.
6947520	6948080	All right.
6948160	6948500	Let's see.
6949021	6952103	Quickly, I want to ask you some more questions here since we have you here tonight.
6952123	6953524	You're so kind to be here live.
6953644	6955886	I know one thing you've also been doing a lot of this year.
6956286	6962909	Besides the Telltale stuff, besides the Umlaut planning, another thing you've been doing quite a bit is you've been doing speaking events.
6963069	6967211	And I know you did PAX East because I saw your panel there when I went to PAX East earlier this year.
6967231	6969793	And I know you did – didn't you do a companion piece at PAX West?
6969913	6970093	Yeah.
6970193	6972074	Kind of same song, different verse type of deal?
6972174	6973194	Same song, different time.
6973274	6974535	Yeah.
6974815	6975596	Different audience.
6975696	6977497	What was the panel all about that you were doing?
6977637	6979878	Well, it was trying to –
6980838	7006799	So, we're trying to communicate, okay, there's a lot of people who obviously give to Child's Play, and there's definitely a lot of people who want to do more, and what I wanted to do with the panels is to establish and get the right general questions answered for people who want to start their own Child's Play community fundraiser.
7007239	7019243	and what that means and just sort of the broad overview of where to get started and to take that next step of starting your own event whether it's a local event or an internet based event.
7020445	7025388	Um, I obviously, you know, we could, we could probably have you recap everything, but that would take an hour, like your panel.
7025408	7027289	So I don't want to, I don't want to recap the whole thing.
7027730	7035254	Um, but just trying to get some of the points out, like, what would you say for somebody who is trying to plan one of these events for themselves?
7035294	7036975	And maybe you can speak from experience on this.
7037296	7042519	You know, what's one thing that people don't anticipate when they say, hey, I'm
7042939	7049563	I wanna throw a rock band charity event at this, I don't know, the Masonic Lodge or wherever people are doing things.
7049823	7051664	You know, we wanna do like a little charity event.
7051764	7058168	And what do you think is like one of the top things people don't foresee in the planning of these events that comes back to surprise them?
7058588	7062310	Like, oops, we should have thought about X. Well, uh...
7063512	7074794	Besides the legal thing, which is a whole other conversation we'll touch on in a few moments, but the big thing that I stress is set up...
7076189	7079871	What I call a list of products, if you're doing an event.
7080311	7087335	Where, okay, these are the things that we're going to have as a quote-unquote product for the event.
7087355	7097521	So to take Umlaut, for example, we have this ultimate band package product, we have this headliner band product, we have the ticket in the door product, we have the raffle ticket product.
7098081	7103344	And by listing these down, you go, okay, how do we make this happen?
7103724	7110234	And that's what's really sort of lost because people don't really know how to take the thing from soup to nuts.
7110275	7116204	It may be a great idea, but you're actually at the event and you go, oh crap, how do I do this?
7116524	7116965	Oh crap.
7118490	7121452	Oh, we have to do all this stuff and then fumble from there.
7121932	7141020	So it's really take a step back with your team and go, start brainstorming, get all the ideas in the world, but then realize that it may be best to put some things off the table if you can't deliver on them because if you do too much and not account for it, it's all going to go to shambles.
7141961	7142921	It's best to just
7143655	7152018	Hold back and make sure you establish yourself and maybe next year you'll do that thing that you wanted to do or whatever.
7153199	7154899	Alright, awesome.
7154939	7155880	I'm trying to think of other things.
7155920	7161842	Do you think sometimes people maybe think too big when it comes to these things?
7162082	7163223	I would say yeah.
7163323	7170145	As people who have the best of intentions and believe me, I'm not discouraging it as someone who did a show in eight weeks.
7171926	7172186	But
7172557	7196151	Well, first of all, for Umlaut, Umlaut wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Foom Drawzer, which was an event that was actually founded by Joel Johnson, started in New York, and then grew to Denver with Brian Cassente of Kotaku doing the Denver event, and then Gizmodo did the San Francisco event, and I went to that event, showed up, and it was
7196941	7204053	It was at Shine Bar on Leet Mission Street in San Francisco, 1337 Mission Street.
7205114	7211805	And it was a 200 capacity bar and it was just show up with rock band, you know, very simple, but packed the place.
7212834	7218597	and that established, okay, there is, we can get enough people in here and that was just with Day of Advertising.
7220238	7226562	And I always, I hadn't done charity work for a while and I wanted to get back into the swing of it.
7227523	7237969	And separately, I always wanted to do an event that incorporated rock band, guitar hero rock band, but focused on the performance aspect.
7239129	7261187	and it was just this perfect storm so I threw my hat in and that's when I first got introduced to Chris Kohler who also helped out with the Fungrauser event in 08 and it was us planning this out actually throughout the year but with Joel and Joel had a lot of things going on so he couldn't
7261607	7277302	continue on and so we were left with making our own event since we already had the deposit reserved for DNA and got things together and it really, it also, don't do this alone, I think is the other thing.
7278763	7280665	If you can't get other people to do it
7282594	7283855	Don't break yourself.
7284195	7287297	And I'm not trying to discourage people.
7287377	7289719	I'm not trying to knock them down.
7289739	7295583	Even if you're a big control freak like me and you want to do everything, you just have to let some of it go because it's too much for one person.
7296224	7303109	It goes down to if you can't get people to help you quite yet in working the event, how are you going to get people there?
7304230	7304930	It's a fair question.
7305230	7305911	It's a fair question.
7306972	7308613	I would say be realistic.
7308633	7308713	Okay.
7310140	7313122	But don't that outright discourage you.
7313422	7313602	Right.
7313642	7316924	Don't let any of this scare you off from trying to do something like that.
7316944	7318064	I think that's important too.
7318084	7323968	We're just trying to be real here on OLR and say, if you're ready to take this dive, by all means dive.
7324248	7325529	But here's some floaties.
7326129	7327630	Some tips so that you don't drown.
7328030	7330011	So let me get to a question from our chat room if I could here.
7330312	7341960	At chat.orangefantasia.com, Salacious Pop is in chat and wants to know, Seg, how long did it take to get incorporated as a non-profit so that people could legally write off donations to you in their taxes?
7342320	7343221	Are the fees steep?
7343241	7346903	Did you have to do it through an attorney to protect your own name and assets?
7347604	7354468	I have the benefit of a wonderful father who does this...
7355909	7356870	Pretty professionally.
7356910	7360032	I say that just like he doesn't actually have it as a job job.
7360133	7371041	But as I alluded to, sort of the family business that wasn't really a business was charity events back home in Detroit, Dearborn.
7372823	7376926	And we did Detroit Children's Hospital Festival of Trees.
7376946	7378007	Yeah.
7379088	7381711	and our high school auction and all that.
7381791	7387778	So he already knows how to, you know, the tax end of things.
7388419	7396128	The state of California was definitely new to us and oh, the state of California was definitely new to us for those filings.
7396449	7397931	But it's
7399580	7402482	It's sort of a level thing.
7403223	7422155	The official birth date, as far as the IRS and the state of California is concerned, for Umlaut is November 17th, and that was when the California URA business that happens to be non-profit was first minted, which is pretty quick.
7422196	7428640	But then, for all the stuff you want to do, like donation buttons, either PayPal or Google Checkout and all that,
7429921	7440686	Yes, we got the TIN very easily, the text ID number for Umlaut, but then you have all this other stuff that has to go through.
7440926	7447509	It takes a while for the IRS to process the paperwork, and you have to fill out the longer form and all this.
7447729	7457154	So really, things did not get settled, settled, settled as far as establishing and getting our determination letter from the IRS until like...
7458803	7459584	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7478047	7482648	Put your paperwork in and know that we could revoke the status because something didn't clear.
7485449	7486589	Everything was up to snuff.
7487049	7495791	Just to back you up in our chat room, DefectiveCandy is in our chat at chat.orange.radio.com and says, From experience, the state of Michigan is way easier to do the non-profit than a place like Cali.
7496631	7504072	California, actually, from what I've been told by others, is the most complicated in the union.
7505153	7506413	I should also state that
7507122	7510606	Every state has a different way, completely.
7510746	7513229	I mean, the IRS is obviously consistent within the U.S.
7513750	7515652	Outside of the U.S., I don't know.
7518115	7520478	Sorry, go ahead.
7520578	7526425	But when I do these panels, I guide people to the general questions that they have to ask themselves, which is basically...
7527566	7534950	Start by Googling up whatever entity in your state does business entities.
7535770	7537971	Secretary of State usually, but not always.
7538011	7539612	Sometimes they have a separate department and all that.
7539912	7542714	And that will start you down on the road of what you need to do.
7542774	7544415	But don't let all this stuff freak you out either.
7544595	7551638	Now, I should also say that there's sort of two general avenues of, at least for Child's Play community fundraisers.
7551938	7552759	There's the...
7554073	7556454	Actual, local, physical event, which is what we do.
7556634	7558475	And then there's the internet-based fundraisers.
7558835	7562937	Now, the internet-based ones, they haven't made as long as they're not stupid.
7563597	7568799	Because, like, for example, Desert Bus, which is the online telethon for them.
7569938	7578500	They use chip-in to point directly to the Child's Play PayPal account, meaning they never touch the money.
7579380	7579621	Ever.
7579901	7580321	Period.
7580761	7589823	The chip-in tracks the metrics of how much people clicking on their button went to Child's Play, but they never touch the money, so they don't have to do any of this.
7591584	7596445	We touch the money at UMA because we have to pay for the venue, and we're taking in
7597345	7601886	and donations ourselves in this physical event, so we have to go through the process.
7602607	7617291	The big numbers, at least at the IRS level, is if you get more than $250 from any one individual or your total take is $5,000, you need a file.
7618851	7622272	You've graduated up to, nope, you need to do it for reals.
7623095	7651599	there's a great follow up from Defective Candy here in our chat room saying there are some great books on the matter I like Nolo's How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation and all states have info on how to do them on their official website you might have to do a tiny bit of digging let me throw this out there too one more kind of little thing here because I know this is one of the things I took away from the panel I was like oh yeah that's something I might not think about otherwise but say if somebody wants to do a Child's Play fundraiser you know before just throwing the name out there like hey we're going to do this Child's Play fundraiser
7652219	7654460	There's probably people they should be getting in touch with, right?
7654820	7661282	Yeah, Kristen Lindsay is... I'm sorry, Kristen, I'm totally forgetting your new title position.
7661302	7665484	Not the official title, but she's the woman in charge of Child's Play.
7665664	7667324	We will call her Goddess of Child's Play.
7667724	7669645	Yeah, Goddess of Child's Play.
7670265	7672106	She has an official title, and I apologize for that.
7672726	7674407	It's okay, it's live radio, you're on the spot.
7674427	7680349	But it's sort of... Child's Play's not going to give you too much help because, let's face it, it's a...
7681409	7682689	They're not going to run the event for you.
7682729	7684110	They're not going to run the event for you.
7685190	7690852	It's good to check in with her and sending an email to her saying, hey, we're doing this event.
7693253	7703316	And she'll give some help, but you have to understand that everyone else is doing all this stuff, especially around this time when the season's ramping up again.
7703336	7704356	Yeah.
7705804	7710967	The process of giving them money is, if you're doing the chip-in thing, the internet-based thing, well, you don't have to do anything.
7711007	7712808	It's already into their PayPal account.
7713868	7726295	But for us, we mail a checkout made out to Child's Play Charity and mail it in to the mailing address that's on the Child's Play website, and there's that.
7727275	7727616	Yeah, yeah.
7749454	7753677	Alright, well, I don't want to spend too much more time talking about that.
7754157	7756079	I don't want to ruin your possible panels in 2011.
7756119	7763964	So, I don't know if you're going to be doing it all over again, but it was, at least when I went and saw it at PAX East, I certainly learned a lot.
7764885	7770329	I know we've kind of dabbled in the idea of maybe doing an OLR charity something something at some point, so it was interesting to hear all that.
7770449	7771690	So, good deal.
7772250	7773211	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7792750	7816736	and it's interesting there's been a little bit of back and forth between Interplay and Bethesda over the rights for Fallout and stuff and I believe at one point Interplay was demanding 50 million dollars for Fallout and apparently Bethesda said no so it'll be interesting to see and I'm sure that a Fallout MMO will be pretty interesting but we'll have to wait a couple years for that
7818356	7822279	The ESRB is rated Twisted Metal for the PlayStation 1 Classics.
7823259	7824840	So obviously that will be coming around pretty soon.
7825481	7829463	Maybe to tie in a little bit with the new Twisted Metal game maybe coming out next year.
7829643	7832625	So we'll have to wait for that one.
7832865	7834826	But at least you can expect that.
7835527	7842251	And then a racing game that is on the PlayStation 3 right now, Mod Nation Racers, is going to be getting a Stunt Pack.
7842771	7843672	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7866145	7867667	and that is free for two weeks.
7867927	7869529	That's beginning October 26th.
7869569	7873193	So if you do have that game or if you're thinking about picking up that game, you might want to download that.
7874614	7875295	Hurry, hurry.
7877137	7877417	Alright.
7878292	7899100	I got some quick stuff for you guys too One of them is about Xbox Live The Xbox Live Silver account is no more It is gone, it is out of here But don't worry You didn't all get suddenly upgraded to gold Actually I don't think that's something anyone would worry about No, here's what really happened The Xbox Live Silver memberships are now just called Xbox Live Free Membership It is what it is Yeah, finally
7899600	7900201	So there it is.
7900902	7905667	And that is launched right along with the Xbox.com remake that went live this week.
7906248	7908790	So they just basically say it's free.
7909631	7911774	They're saying the features did not change.
7911914	7914036	The name for the paid membership does not change.
7914176	7915818	Just this little component of it.
7916179	7916679	Just so you know.
7916739	7917740	It's easier branding.
7918221	7918822	I think so.
7918902	7919643	Yeah.
7920983	7930106	Plus, I think especially when one of PlayStation's big things is selling the free PlayStation Network, I think for them to be able to say... Not quite anymore, but... Yeah, exactly.
7930426	7932947	Now they're kind of on par there, so it works out.
7933668	7937149	Tron Evolution is getting some voice acting from the movie, which is pretty cool.
7937549	7944131	Olivia Wilde, who plays Korra in the upcoming Tron Legacy movie, is going to be doing some voices in Tron Evolution.
7944271	7944811	That's pretty cool.
7945251	7949613	Also, the voice of the original Tron character, Bruce Boxleitner, is going to be in there, so that's
7950614	7952275	From the Scarecrow and Mrs. King
7980317	7987965	NBA Jam, as we've talked about for a couple weeks on this show, is getting spun off into its PS3 and 360 retail releases.
