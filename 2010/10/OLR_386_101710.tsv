7000	12000	These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku
14000	24000	Tonight, October 17th, 2010, fans petition for a new Bomani game release, the developers of Game Room are set to close, and Blizzard takes the enablers of cheating to court.
24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	42000	We are that show dedicated to video games and gaming and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
43000	45000	You know, we're that show where every gamer has a voice.
46000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.
49000	53000	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	I apparently fail at boiling water.
56000	58000	That's bad. That means you're not going to be able to cook anything if you can't boil water.
59000	62000	You're going to be in my league where it's like Hot Pockets and Easy Mac and Cheese.
63000	69000	I was making fake coffee for my French press and didn't boil enough water, so I'm boiling more water.
70000	74000	You fail at boiling water. That should be a losing screen in some... boil water the game, I don't know.
75000	76000	Next in Cooking Mama, it's Boiling Mama.
76000	81000	Say hello, but don't boil mama. That would be an M-rated game.
82000	84000	Alright, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
85000	86000	Hello.
87000	88000	How you doing, Loki?
89000	90000	Good.
91000	92000	Are you eating and talking on a radio show at the same time?
93000	94000	Yes, I am.
95000	96000	Shame on you. You're violating every single good rule of radio. What are you eating over there, sir?
97000	98000	Triple bacon pizza.
99000	103000	So let's see, last week it was double bacon pizza, and I seem to distinctly remember the one and only Loki saying something about,
103000	106000	Triple bacon pizza is too much bacon.
107000	110000	I can't remember if it did triple or quadruple, so I'm testing both.
111000	114000	I almost said quadruple today, but I was like, ehhh, ramp it up slowly.
115000	116000	It's really good, actually.
117000	118000	I just want to point out, I have a terrible Loki impersonation.
119000	121000	It's triple bacon pizza. I don't know what I'm doing.
122000	125000	Hi. Also say hello. We have a very special guest tonight. I promised this last week.
126000	128000	If you haven't heard the podcast, though, we do have a very special guest.
128000	135000	You could call it a little bit of All Games Cross promotion, in a way, because we have here live in studio, not on Skype,
136000	139000	but here live in studio all the way from Under Sedation Live. Say hello to Jessica Harper.
140000	142000	Hello, people. Yes, I'm actually sitting on the floor.
143000	144000	Yes, as opposed to on the toilet.
145000	147000	As opposed to on the toilet, which is where I usually am right before the show.
148000	149000	How are you, lovely Jessica?
150000	155000	I am doing just fabulously, and yeah, it's kind of cool to have, like, we had our All Games moment just a few minutes ago,
155000	161000	where it was Bobby Black Wolf and OLR and Under Sedation Live all in one little happy family right there.
162000	163000	So that was kind of cool.
164000	166000	Absolutely. So while Jessica brought it up, let me get that out there.
167000	172000	We do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
173000	174000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
175000	179000	And if you are listening live, make sure you join us in our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
180000	181000	You think that's everything? I think that's good.
181000	186000	So, Jessica Harper, you might know her online as Iguana Girl.
187000	187000	Yes.
188000	189000	And that's because you are actually an iguana?
190000	195000	Yes, actually, yes. In the middle of the night, I just have these moments where I turn green,
196000	197000	and I don't turn into the Hulk, I just turn into an iguana.
198000	205000	No, actually, the nickname originally was given to me by friends because I had an obsession with iguanas.
205000	211000	I had an iguana at the time, and Girl, G-R-R-L, was because I was always the video gamer geek
212000	217000	out of all of the boys that worked over at this ISP, the internet service provider that we were at.
218000	223000	So I was the girl. I wasn't totally, you know, frilly and prissy and all that.
224000	229000	Now, see, I always thought it might have been a, hey, girl, type of thing, but I guess that's G-U-R.
230000	232000	Because when Alan types in an email to me, he'll say G-U-R-R-L.
232000	237000	Yeah, no, mine was more, you know, the female empowerment grrr.
238000	239000	Grrr. Okay.
240000	241000	I want a smash.
242000	246000	It just kind of stuck, and I've been using that nickname since, like, 97 now, I think.
247000	248000	Awesome.
249000	250000	So, yeah, just always been that way.
251000	254000	Alright. Well, Jessica's here tonight for, you know, well, obviously, we've been doing this show forever,
255000	258000	and she's never sat in. I don't think you, well, maybe, it's been a long time if you have.
259000	260000	We've done top tens.
260000	263000	Maybe like a long time ago, but it's definitely been several years since you've been here in the studio with us.
264000	269000	Oh, yeah, I think the last time I was probably back at your place, like, in Rancho.
270000	275000	Yeah, we were doing the crossover stuff for DDR Free Radio, and I was like, hey, our shows can get along. It's great. We're having fun.
276000	277000	Didn't we do the top ten Bimani songs of that year?
278000	279000	No, I remember going on to Folsom.
280000	281000	Yeah, yeah, I think we take the show or something.
282000	285000	Anyway, regardless, it's been a heck of a long time since Jessica's been on the show,
285000	292000	which is kind of bittersweet in a way because Jessica and I kind of started, in a way, a lot of our internet radio stuffs together
293000	297000	over on Undersedation Live when the head honcho over there, Travis, used to live out here.
298000	299000	Yeah, and I'm back, bitches.
300000	305000	The HBIC for Undersedation Live. Travis used to live out here in SAC, and Jessica, myself, and Travis were all kind of the start of that show.
306000	312000	So this show, in a way, Orange Haunts Radio, in a way, I don't want Travis' ego to get too big if he's listening, but in a way...
312000	314000	In a way, please.
315000	317000	No, it is. It's a spinoff of Undersedation Live.
318000	323000	No, because you started OLR pretty soon. I think we were right in tandem with DDR Freak Radio and OLR.
324000	331000	Yeah, which is funny because it was one of those, like, we weren't comparing notes things because Jessica and I were on a break at that time.
332000	334000	We could get into some of the fun stuff later if we wanted.
334000	343000	No, no, no, no. That was before the break break because we were still doing US Altogether and we were still getting along, but it was before that.
344000	352000	Right. But, you know, I think I mentioned this during the marathon show or something, like, you know, it's kind of, you know, funny the way things work sometimes because obviously this is ten years ago,
353000	359000	and at this time, you know, we're in our 20s and just very different and there was a lot of stuff going on and a lot of...
359000	369000	I was personally looking back in a very toxic situation at the time that didn't bode itself well to the future and, you know, things happen and unfortunately Jessica and I kind of...
370000	379000	We had a little break up for a while, but we're cool now and I think it's great that she's back in the radio business and I've listened to a few episodes of Undersedation Live.
380000	383000	Whether Travis knows it or not, I really do listen once in a while when I can. I know, I know.
384000	385000	I'm in a tie of shock.
385000	388000	I know, I know. I know all the smack he's talking about me over there. I don't think I don't know.
389000	391000	But, yeah, no, I think it's great. I think it's just awesome.
392000	394000	You see, what I should have done is I should have made him play the voicemail.
395000	402000	Considering that that voicemail was recorded during that same trip where you played DDR for the first time.
403000	404000	It's true and I don't have a copy of that.
405000	410000	So, Travis, if you're listening, if you want to, you know, later on when we're taking calls...
411000	411000	Yes.
412000	413000	And the voicemail she's referring to is...
413000	414000	I'll be back.
415000	417000	I guess we should tell this story real quick. We will get into the gaming news and all that stuff in a little bit.
418000	427000	But the way Jessica and I kind of got into DDR in the first place, and if it wasn't for DDR, I would probably not have ultimately met Dark Soccer and Loki, at least in the way that I did.
428000	435000	But the way Jessica and I got into DDR in the beginning is that we went to the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Picture Show convention and then we just...
436000	438000	What happened? We just kind of said, screw it, to the convention one night, right?
438000	445000	We just decided that we were going to go hit some arcades because we were bored out of our minds and there was this 1.5 machine.
446000	451000	That's right. This machine that was flashing and it was saying, I'm playing Super Gay Music. Come play. It's fun.
452000	455000	Super Gay Music. And Rob went like a fly. You know, like a moth to a flame.
456000	457000	Exactly. It was fun.
458000	461000	But yeah, you know, it's like, oh, it has a pad and I wonder what we're supposed to do.
461000	469000	What ultimately drew you to the machine though? You couldn't be the Uber Gay Music. You must have just been like, it's colors.
470000	474000	I guess I had a new shiny moment. I'm guessing, you know.
475000	478000	But yeah. And what was our first song? You remember?
479000	481000	I want to say it had to have been the one star, Have You Never Been Mellow.
482000	483000	No.
484000	485000	Do we pump it up to Boom Boom Dollar?
486000	488000	We went Boom Boom Dollar first and we failed.
488000	496000	And then we proceeded to go right back and go, okay, well maybe we should try this again, but let's do it on an easier level.
497000	506000	And then we ended up doing Butterfly. And then once we beat Butterfly, we went back to Boom Boom Dollar and I think we ended up beating it the second time.
507000	513000	I think there was a little bit of ego there because I remember we used to play the old Busta, here in the US it was Busta Groove.
513000	519000	But of course that drives Jamie bonkers because overseas it was Busta Move. But we didn't know any better at the time because we were just like, ooh, flashy.
520000	529000	But we used to play those games and really liked it. So we were like, oh, we're the masters at Busta Move or Busta Groove. We'll kick this thing's ass. And it's like, boom, failed.
530000	534000	I remember going to your old apartment and playing on that one pad that was for some Disney game.
535000	537000	Or like some child's.
538000	540000	I thought it was like a Britney's dance pad or something.
540000	550000	The very first, before DDR was on PlayStation 1, they actually released a Disney's Jungle Book Jungle Groove game.
551000	555000	And it came with this dance pad that was probably made for a seven year old.
556000	561000	And it was a cheap little dance game that I think was really just existed to beat DDR to the market.
562000	563000	But it had some funny Jungle Book songs on it.
564000	565000	It was cute.
565000	569000	I want to walk like you, talk like you too. You know, you could kind of dance to it. It was cute.
570000	575000	And then Dark Sakura, she was kind of like, by this time we knew her and she was kind of like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
576000	578000	You need a little plug in the back and you need to burn a copy of Thursday. I'm coming over.
579000	581000	I was like, Rob, get me a paperclip.
582000	587000	Back in those days when you could do the single swap, which I never learned how to do anything but the single swap.
588000	589000	I was like, screw it. I'll just get this little thing and plug it in.
589000	594000	See, I was lucky. I actually got to have mine professionally, semi-professionally modded by Brad.
595000	601000	And then I remember a bunch of folks came over one night. I think it was the first night we were playing third mix.
602000	605000	And weren't you fortunate enough not to have downstairs neighbors at the time?
606000	609000	Or at least if I didn't have a downstairs neighbor, she didn't complain at all.
610000	613000	I do remember you freaking out going, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
613000	619000	Oh, yeah, because our friend at the time, Eric, was this very tall, very skinny dude.
620000	626000	And I remember he was like, I'm going to pump it up to like a six footer or something and play on this little jungle beat dance mat thing.
627000	633000	And it was like, really funny. So good times. Good memories.
634000	639000	I remember a later Las Vegas trip that you and I took where we went to that same DDR machine.
639000	643000	Yep. Very drunk. Oh, yes. And called Rob.
644000	649000	Actually, it wasn't exactly the same because it was a fourth or a fourth plus.
650000	653000	No, we went to one at Circus Circus. Yeah, but there was a fourth or a fourth plus at the time.
654000	659000	That's it. They had removed the 1.5 and they moved it to the front of that same arcade area.
660000	664000	Because for those who don't know, Circus Circus in Vegas has like five billion arcades to it. Seriously.
664000	672000	And there's like one arcade where we ended up finding a karaoke machine, but that's, you know, a different story for Travis to find the music.
673000	680000	That's a whole nother episode and that'll probably be on Understation Live when Travis is like, hmm, let's make an ass of Rob this week again.
681000	684000	I got me a car. Okay.
685000	687000	Sounds like you leave them so many opportunities.
688000	692000	You know what? What can I say? I was young and dumb in my 20s and I'm young and dumb now.
692000	693000	Okay, bye.
695000	698000	I have like a whole list of Rob quotes that go through my head.
699000	700000	I'm surprised there's not a Rob soundboard that Travis is in.
701000	702000	You know, we actually considered it.
703000	704000	I remember my favorite...
705000	706000	Mic fail. Mic fail. Boop, boop, mic fail.
707000	708000	Hey! Better?
709000	712000	I was going to stop and get you a cord. If I hadn't driven five hours today, I was going to stop and get you a cord.
712000	725000	I remember a trip to, um, Miggle. No, it wasn't. It was, uh, Sunnyvale Golf Land where I was drinking out of the Pepsi bone and I gave Rob a drink and he gave it back to me.
726000	728000	And right when I'm drinking, Rob says, by the way, I have gay.
729000	731000	You cut out right as you said that.
732000	732000	Oh, shit.
733000	734000	Your mic sucks. I hate it.
735000	736000	It's not the mic. It's the cord.
736000	742000	But, no, I let Rob take a drink out of my big Pepsi bone and then I took it back to take a drink and Rob says, by the way, I have gay.
743000	744000	That was the best ever.
745000	746000	Good times.
747000	748000	No, your mic, you got to... I don't...
749000	750000	Ah!
751000	752000	We might have to play mic pass around or something tonight.
753000	756000	Alright, yeah, well, of course that really annoying thing works.
757000	764000	Alright, look, let's, uh, let's start off the show finally with talking a little bit about our gaming weeks and some of the other stuff outside of DDR that we've been playing.
764000	767000	Um, let's start with Dark Soccer as we always do. How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?
768000	775000	I played your Final Fantasy XIII game thingy with a controller that was still charging and I have a complaint about the PlayStation charging controller thing.
776000	782000	The little micro USB cable thing. It's too damn short. Seriously, do people in Japan have no room in their par...
783000	784000	No, I guess they don't.
785000	792000	Um, so I played some Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they totally stole the ship and with the Shiva sisters who are sexy.
792000	795000	And, dude, they turned into a freakin' bike.
796000	797000	OMG, spoilers.
798000	799000	I don't care.
800000	801000	They're scissoring and they're a bike at the same time.
802000	810000	Ah, that's hot. Anyway, um, I also played lots of Star Trek Online. Um, I didn't have a whole lot of time last week for games because, uh, things are really cracking down.
811000	815000	You know, I'm on the American River Review magazine class. Oh my god.
815000	824000	So, um, when I wasn't pulling out my hair over my deadlines, I was also playing, um, Star Trek Online and I finally got my Breen.
825000	839000	And you can't really change the way they look or anything because the Breen wear this, like, suit that keeps it, you know, zero degrees cold inside because they all want to look like, you know, Princess Leia in her, uh, outfit from when she went to rescue Han Solo.
840000	841000	Yeah.
841000	847000	Um, so anyway, and I played, uh, lots of Plants vs. Zombies. Duh.
848000	854000	And I played, um, I tried Narbacular Drop again. It's still confusing as hell.
855000	861000	And, uh, as thing is about, yes, I have a grudge. Mud.
862000	869000	For the record, I watched three Ju-On movies also during the course of, um, yesterday and the day before.
869000	872000	And they were fantastic, as always.
873000	876000	And Darcy is responding to comments in our chat room at chat.orangehelsiority.com.
877000	878000	Yes, because I can make the grudge noise.
879000	880000	She doesn't have Tourette's. She's just...
881000	883000	My little side giggle was because I saw that Travis was saying something.
884000	885000	Oh god, did he join chat? Uh oh.
886000	887000	Yes, he did.
888000	889000	Uh oh, he says, I will torment all. Uh oh.
890000	891000	Uh oh.
892000	896000	Which means he's probably recording the whole show tonight to snip out the really bad and, and, uh, horrible sounding parts.
896000	901000	And he'll string it all together and make it sound like, you know, I said something like, well, something really bad.
902000	903000	Because if I say it now, then he'll cut it out.
904000	909000	And Spazinator, for the record, um, I actually don't have a micro USB extension, so it didn't work.
910000	911000	And, um, I also...
912000	913000	Do you have USB extension cables you can get?
914000	916000	I know, but I was busy playing the game last night in my pajamas.
917000	919000	And I am not one of those people who goes to Walmart in my pajamas.
920000	922000	But you should have a fully charged controller.
922000	928000	And I didn't want to use a hub because the only hub that I have is my TARDIS hub that was a gift to me from the lovely Tiara.
929000	934000	And my TARDIS stub, my TARDIS stub hub stays firmly attached to my computer.
935000	937000	But it makes TARDIS noise when you plug it in.
938000	940000	I have a couple of friends that have that, it's cute.
941000	942000	Alright, is that it for your gaming week?
943000	944000	Yes.
945000	946000	Sonic screwdriver doesn't work though.
947000	948000	Oh, boo hoo, cry, sad.
949000	950000	Loki, hey, how was your gaming week?
950000	956000	Um, I didn't play a whole lot. I played a lot of iPad games, or iPod games, I guess.
957000	959000	I keep wanting to call it an iPhone, but, I mean, it's the same damn thing.
960000	963000	How about iOS? Because that's the universal system they run on.
964000	965000	Okay, yeah, I can do iOS.
966000	967000	So, iOS games.
968000	970000	I actually downloaded Bookworm.
971000	975000	I swear, my co-worker, you know, downloads shit and he's like, he's all,
975000	979000	yeah, I got this game, but I'm like, ooh, I gotta get that. I don't know why.
980000	984000	But yeah, I jumped on the Bookworm train good ten years late.
985000	987000	And, um, yeah, it's pretty fun.
988000	989000	And played quite a bit of that.
990000	992000	Actually, my wife was playing it at the same time on her iPod.
993000	994000	So, that was fun.
995000	1000000	And then, I've been playing a lot of Climber, which is just this free game that you can get
1000000	1005000	where you have this grappling hook that you launch yourself into the sky with.
1006000	1007000	So, it's not like Crazy Climber.
1008000	1009000	No, not like Crazy Climber.
1010000	1011000	But it's pretty cool. It's got some pretty epic music.
1012000	1013000	And then, speaking of epic games...
1014000	1016000	Not as epic as Robot Unicorn Attack, which I also played. Sorry.
1017000	1019000	Yes, the Heavy Metal Edition.
1020000	1022000	They have taken the game and made it that much better.
1023000	1024000	Oh, I saw that.
1025000	1028000	I actually played that while I was waiting for my pizza to be done.
1028000	1029000	Did they add fire?
1030000	1031000	There is fire in that.
1032000	1033000	Oh, they did make it better.
1034000	1035000	That was the first time I played it.
1036000	1037000	I was like, there's only one awesome thing this game is missing, and that's fire.
1038000	1039000	It's got lots of skulls.
1040000	1043000	It has mountains with earthworm-type tentacle things coming out of it.
1044000	1046000	It's got, you know, pentagrams.
1048000	1049000	It's gonna be awesome.
1050000	1051000	Is that it?
1052000	1053000	Best 99 cents ever.
1054000	1055000	Put that away right now.
1055000	1057000	Anything else you played this week?
1058000	1059000	Hey John, we're calling to you.
1060000	1061000	You know, more of that, of course.
1065000	1070000	No, but seriously, I don't know if you've heard the song yet that's in this game, and I will pull it up real quick.
1071000	1072000	Hopefully it's really loud.
1073000	1074000	Let me read some comments from chat while you're doing that.
1075000	1077000	Let's see. Loomis has a suggestion in our chat room.
1078000	1081000	You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.
1081000	1084000	Did you hear that, DarkSakura? Loomis in our chat room?
1085000	1088000	You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.
1089000	1091000	I know that, but I wanted to play and both of my controllers were dead.
1092000	1094000	You need to be proactive, young lady.
1095000	1097000	Alright, here's a brief snippet of the song.
1100000	1103000	That doesn't sound very heavy metal. It sounded all like...
1103000	1110000	This is like a Dragon Force song or something.
1111000	1112000	Seriously?
1113000	1114000	It's so awesome.
1115000	1116000	Rob, I have one thing to say to you.
1117000	1118000	What? I hate you.
1119000	1124000	Mud in our chat room says I'm pronouncing it wrong. It's I-O-S, I think is what he's trying to say.
1125000	1127000	I-O-S. I don't like I-O-S. I like I-O-S.
1128000	1129000	It makes it sound like GLaDOS.
1130000	1131000	It makes it sound like I-DOS.
1131000	1132000	A little bit. Oh, whatever.
1133000	1135000	It's potato-potato to me. I think it's all the same. I don't know.
1136000	1138000	There you go. chat.orangelandrater.com.
1139000	1144000	Salacious Pop says Bookworm in Bookworm Adventures is awesome, except for when it gets really hard and makes you feel stupid.
1145000	1152000	Well, they're dropping a bunch of letters that were on fire and it's like Z, Q, U. I'm like, thanks! Love that!
1153000	1154000	I could make Ziklicka!
1155000	1157000	What am I gonna spell with Q, U, V, Z?
1158000	1159000	Quijibo.
1159000	1167000	And it's like, and Nellie's like, I got to level 15. I'm like, I'm on level 12 with eight letters that I can't use all on fire.
1168000	1171000	That's when you start looking for ass every single time. Ass, ass.
1172000	1174000	Ass, ass, ass. That's what I do. Play dirty words.
1175000	1177000	May I also point, speaking of words, may I point out a travesty against humanity?
1178000	1179000	Yes.
1180000	1183000	Lexulus no longer has Solitaire Mode. I'm pissed off. Okay, you can continue.
1183000	1189000	And apparently the word dong is not an acceptable word in there, because I had that and I could have knew.
1190000	1192000	See, that's what we need. We need the sexualized version of Bookworm.
1193000	1198000	Well, if they did Words with Friends Pirate Edition, I don't see why they don't do Words with Friends Sexy Edition.
1199000	1202000	See, this is where I have my problems, because they have a Blackberry.
1203000	1205000	They don't have like a Words with Friends Z Clone thing?
1206000	1207000	No. Hell no.
1208000	1211000	Because it doesn't matter, because who am I going to do that with? Everybody else has a freaking iPhone.
1211000	1216000	But some of it crosses over. Like, uh, well, there's the, uh, what is it?
1217000	1218000	Open Faint. That's right, that's the network.
1219000	1224000	Which, I gotta admit, you know, there is, let me put it this way, I have two folders of games that are all Open Faint compatible.
1225000	1234000	I have half a folder of Game Center stuff. That should say something to you, Apple, that perhaps your Game Center is a little too little too late.
1234000	1242000	Too late. You know what, on my iPhone, you know what I play that's Open Faint enabled more than anything else? The Commodore 64 collection that they have on the iPhone.
1243000	1244000	That is so unsurprising.
1245000	1246000	Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, Loki.
1247000	1247000	That is it.
1248000	1257000	Then let me move on to the lovely Jessica Harper over here. Now, since it's your first time on the show in a very long time, let me, let me just kind of ask the starting question we usually do, and that is, what kind of gamer are you?
1257000	1263000	You know, because every gamer likes, you know, some people like sports games, some people like the music games. What kind of games are your favorite?
1264000	1274000	Well, um, I am, I'm currently a mostly an active gamer, unfortunately. Due to circumstances regarding the relationship that I just came from, I had to sell off a lot of my systems.
1275000	1284000	So that pretty much leaves me with my computer that's sub-par for gaming. It's my little appy, and I have a PS2, and that's it.
1284000	1299000	But primarily when it comes to games, I have a tendency to, I like to go towards puzzle games. I like Final Fantasy style, RPG, blah blah blah.
1300000	1309000	I used to be big into first person shooters. That was a really big thing for me when I first started gaming. I used to like to piss off the boys by, you know, fragging them constantly.
1310000	1311000	You used to be like a Doom 2 girl, huh?
1311000	1313000	I was a Quake 2 girl.
1314000	1322000	I used to actually go to a place that was here in Sacramento, actually in Citrus Heights, called Cosmic Drip Cyber Cafe.
1323000	1327000	That was the thing over behind the 7-Eleven, wasn't it? I know that place!
1327000	1340000	Yeah, and one of the first things they did is they offered $40 for 40 hours of play, which was pretty damn awesome when you figured out how much I actually used it.
1341000	1348000	And I used to sit there for 4, 5, 6 hours each night, just hanging out, drinking my Jolt Cola, and fragging the boys.
1349000	1350000	Good times.
1350000	1356000	Do you have a particular favorite game, besides the DDR and 2DX we've been reminiscing about, do you have a favorite game?
1358000	1360000	I'm not putting you on the spot a little bit, but I'm sorry.
1361000	1362000	Typing of the Dead.
1363000	1370000	Typing of the Dead is up there. I'd probably get thrown out of the club if I said Final Fantasy 7.
1371000	1373000	I don't think there's anything wrong with Final Fantasy 7, love.
1374000	1375000	I get thrown out of the club.
1375000	1379000	Oh, please. This is a safe house.
1380000	1381000	Final Fantasy 9.
1382000	1384000	If you said Final Fantasy 14, I might have an issue.
1385000	1394000	Well, see, again, I haven't been able to game much. I work too dang much, so I don't get to sit down. Lately, my main game of choice? Price is right on Facebook.
1395000	1398000	You know, Rob, they do have a free trial to Final Fantasy 14.
1398000	1407000	I'd heard there's this whole free trial, and I gotta really stop hating on Final Fantasy 14, because I didn't play it outside the beta, so I'm not being fair. I'm only going off of what I heard.
1408000	1416000	And everything I've heard kind of collaborates with my experience with the beta, so I feel a little justified, but I am being a hater, I guess.
1417000	1418000	I'll try it out.
1419000	1421000	Please do. I would love to hear your review on this game.
1422000	1424000	We should be recording while I play it.
1424000	1426000	You get some interesting new expletives to add to this show.
1427000	1431000	Who else is pissed off that they renamed all the races? It makes no sense.
1432000	1436000	Oh, we're gonna give them different names. They're different races, even though they're exactly the same.
1437000	1440000	I gotta read this comment from chat too, because SalaciousPop I think is right on the money here.
1441000	1444000	Sky will stop the show if she says Final Fantasy 8.
1445000	1447000	I might have thrown her out if she said 8 was her favorite.
1448000	1449000	No, no, no, no.
1450000	1451000	It's not bad.
1451000	1453000	It's not bad.
1454000	1459000	Here's the thing, and I've even told Alan this, I kind of play up my hate for 8 on the show a little bit.
1460000	1463000	Dude, gun blades! It's a sword and a gun together!
1464000	1470000	But I really hated the whole magic drawing thing. It really ruined the game for me.
1471000	1473000	I don't remember that. I must have blocked it out.
1474000	1476000	But it did have a good story. I will agree with you.
1476000	1480000	And the fact that it had the full screen battles as opposed to Final Fantasy 7's crop thing, that was neat.
1481000	1486000	It did have its technological advances, so I will concede on some points, but it still sucks.
1487000	1490000	Well, if there's nothing else Jessica wants to share?
1491000	1497000	Video gaming wise, that's usually the part of the show on USL where I go silent and just let the boys play.
1498000	1502000	Eventually I'll get an Xbox and start getting back into the swing of things.
1502000	1507000	Awesome. I hope maybe with some of the price drops that are rumored, either this holiday or next holiday,
1508000	1511000	it'll be really easy for you to get either a Wii or a 360 and you can kind of pick right back up.
1512000	1513000	Yeah, it would be a 360.
1514000	1516000	360 would use the refurbisher down like $109.
1517000	1519000	Yeah, pretty soon, within the next month or two.
1520000	1522000	You should definitely ask Sandy Claws for one. You never know.
1523000	1526000	Alright, let me talk about Miami EME Wii, which is actually kind of short.
1527000	1530000	I don't have a whole lot to advertise because World of Warcraft dominates a lot of things.
1530000	1534000	But I did play a couple of new things. I played Sonic 4 for a little bit.
1535000	1541000	And I can sort of see where Loki was disappointed in last week's review.
1542000	1544000	And if you didn't hear his thing on Sonic 4, go listen to last week's.
1545000	1548000	I didn't like some of Sonic's controls.
1549000	1553000	I felt like the whole acceleration part of Sonic felt really broken to me.
1554000	1557000	Like the 0 to 60, if you'll call it, was really weird for me.
1557000	1560000	Here's my thing too, and this is not just a Sonic complaint.
1561000	1563000	This is kind of a complaint of a lot of games that are coming out now.
1564000	1567000	You don't need to make everything polygons.
1568000	1570000	You can stick with the sprites and they can still be good.
1571000	1574000	You don't have to make it all polygons because, honestly, it looks a little weird.
1575000	1578000	Um, it was okay. I didn't mind the graphics, actually.
1579000	1581000	It looked like a souped up version of Sonic 2.
1582000	1584000	Which also, in a way, though, was kind of my problem with it.
1584000	1586000	It really didn't, at least in those first few levels.
1587000	1590000	Granted, I understand the later levels are going to be a different kind of game.
1591000	1595000	But I kind of felt like it was just an HD version of Sonic 2 in the beginning with a different level layout.
1596000	1599000	Which, you know, take it or leave it. Retro-tastic is kind of where it's at.
1600000	1604000	I think a lot of companies are trying to find the right place to be with retro games.
1605000	1609000	Like, Mega Man 9 definitely tickled a lot of people for the happy...
1610000	1611000	Look at Capcom. They're doing it right.
1611000	1616000	But I don't know. I don't know if, necessarily, Mega Man 10 was really the right step.
1617000	1622000	I actually was a little disappointed in Mega Man 10, simply because Mega Man 10...
1623000	1627000	I expected that Mega Man 10 was going to be this epic, epicness, tenth Mega...
1628000	1632000	I think Mega Man Universe and what's happening there is what I was expecting for Mega Man 10.
1633000	1635000	Mega Man 10, as we got it, felt like Mega Man 9 Part 2.
1636000	1637000	If that makes any sense at all.
1637000	1641000	Which, yes, I understand. They're all... The old games are kind of like that.
1642000	1646000	I don't know. I just expected the level of epicness to be raised rather than,
1647000	1649000	we're going to get away with the same joke that we did with Mega Man 9.
1650000	1651000	I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else.
1652000	1654000	Done once, it's brilliant. Done twice, it's a gimmick.
1655000	1658000	Exactly. Exactly right. That's kind of where I was at with it.
1659000	1662000	See, what I would want to see is instead of them doing what they did with 10,
1662000	1666000	if they did like a new X and made it all SNES-tastic.
1667000	1670000	Yeah, that would have been like at least a slightly different gimmick and would have been kind of cool.
1671000	1673000	But whatever, it is what it is. It's not like a bad game.
1674000	1679000	It's just, you know, it was a little more forgettable than 9 because it felt like the same joke as 9 all over again.
1680000	1684000	But anyway, how did I get from Sonic 4 to Mega Man? Oh well, whatever. I guess this whole retro thing.
1684000	1691000	So I think in a way, maybe it does relate because in a way that's where Sonic 4 lost some of its magic for me.
1692000	1696000	Is that we've already seen Sonic on Xbox Live Arcade. We've already seen the Sonic 2.
1697000	1701000	So it's kind of like to get the Sonic 4 and have it just be kind of like, oh well now it's the HD graphics.
1702000	1709000	And even when it's the HD graphics, it really doesn't, it just feels like a sharper Sonic 2 if you will.
1710000	1711000	You know what I mean? I don't know.
1711000	1716000	But of course, there's gonna be the hardcore Sonic fans that are just gonna eat it up and that's good.
1717000	1724000	However, you gotta admit, it is a little dumpy of them to be doing this whole splitting it up into the episodes to get more money out of it in the long run thing.
1725000	1728000	I do think, especially now having played it, that was kind of a tacky move.
1729000	1732000	And I think it's one that's gonna come bite them when it comes to the sales of episode 2.
1733000	1734000	But we'll see. Prove me wrong, Sonic fans. We'll see.
1734000	1742000	Otherwise, the only other game I checked out was on the iPhone and I totally deserved to get teased and made fun of and called names for this.
1743000	1750000	But I was checking out free games on Game Center and all this and I downloaded a game called Pocket Frogs.
1751000	1752000	What?
1753000	1760000	It's called Pocket Frogs and it's a game you breed frogs and you breed them.
1760000	1767000	You might have a purple frog with green spots and you made it with a white frog and you might get a purple frog with white spots.
1768000	1770000	You from Easy Vibe is the pocket frog.
1771000	1773000	Is this like Derby Owners Club for frogs?
1774000	1778000	But you don't race them. You jump them around on lily pads.
1779000	1783000	You eat flies and that's really all you ever do with them. You can't combat against friends or anything.
1783000	1789000	So I will freely admit, this game is fucking stupid. I don't know why I keep playing it.
1790000	1795000	It's like this obsessive need to collect bullshit. This is like a hoarder's dream right here, this game.
1796000	1797000	But in my defense, it was completely free.
1798000	1799000	New show, E Hoarder, starring Rob Roberts.
1800000	1801000	Seriously?
1802000	1808000	I had to remove a bunch of apps off of my iPod because I've actually maxed out the memory. I had like 6.5 gigs worth of apps on there.
1808000	1814000	Of course a lot of them were like those 400 gig apps like the Monkey Island games.
1815000	1820000	Multiple folks in chat are saying so it's chocobo breeding. Yeah, it's kind of like the chocobo breeding in a way.
1821000	1824000	Except you can't fly your chocobo over the mountains.
1825000	1828000	And land in the giant crater so that you can get the materia.
1828000	1837000	There are pay parts to this game and that is like if you want to use like a growth potion to make your frog egg grow instantly and not have to wait 30 minutes, you can pay like 99 cents.
1838000	1845000	Or you can get the mail to move fat. Like if all this like impatient people bullshit I can't believe anybody would spend money on but I guess they're making money off it somehow.
1846000	1851000	You can pay for that. I am happy to say I have not paid one cent towards this game and if I do, you can slap me. Okay?
1852000	1854000	I'll remember that. I'll remember that next time you buy something on WoW.
1854000	1860000	No, hold on. Girl that is different. It is not.
1861000	1865000	If I get the collector's edition of WoW to get my little death wing that is a different story.
1866000	1875000	Actually Rob, I bought a pet on Star Trek Online. It's like a giant Vulcan cat. It's cute! And I bought tribbles.
1875000	1883000	ActDeafed in our chatroom says Rob, you basically defended all FarmVille players all over the world. No, because FarmVille is lame.
1884000	1888000	Speaking of which, I am currently on dog sitting duty for my mom's FarmVille account.
1889000	1893000	Wait, wait. You got to explain this. Hold on. Is your mom like super addicted to FarmVille?
1893000	1908000	My mom is super addicted to FarmVille, FrontierVille, that Treasure Island one, all that crap. And she has this farm full of animals and she is insisting that I watch her dogs. I have to feed her dogs because she's on vacation for a week.
1909000	1913000	I wonder if there's actually some sort of money to be made for a service like that. You know what I mean?
1914000	1919000	Remember Neopets and how you could just put them in the kennel? They should have something like that.
1919000	1931000	Seriously. I think a couple of them do. Hire the immigrant workers? I wouldn't mind hiring some from a damn hotel. I'm sorry, I don't play Hotel City or anything.
1932000	1938000	Ray Iannami in our chatroom says just shut down her accounts while she's gone. It's an intervention. Burn it to the ground!
1938000	1953000	I'd love to, but I would probably not have a mother after that. Then it would be like, you know, hey, this is Rob Roberts on CBS 13 and Jessica Harper was found dead this evening. Strangled to death by your mother.
1954000	1964000	I shouldn't feel any pressure here, but she's like, if you don't feed them every single day, they're going to die. They're going to run away. They're not going to want to be part of my farm anymore. I'm like, okay, mom, I'll feed your stupid dogs.
1965000	1966000	That sounds like my mother.
1966000	1980000	And she's on Facebook all the time saying, I didn't get my treat basket! Where's my treat basket? Except, you know, in much more of a Southern accent. Y'all, I can't find my treat basket!
1980000	1996000	I am so glad that my mother, she doesn't play that shit. Well, she stalks people on Twitter. That's what she does. Instead of getting into Farmville and all that stuff, she just reads my Twitter and then calls me and says, what is this about? Why did you tweet about this?
1996000	2010000	Yeah, I actually just posted something on Facebook a couple days ago that was, you know, the anti-parental tool for Facebook. It was, you know, an SNL skit and I posted it up. I'm like, so mom, do I need this?
2011000	2019000	Basically, it's like talking about how, well, do you post things that your mom doesn't want to see? And it shows pictures of like him doing, you know, smoking a bong and what have you.
2019000	2030000	And apparently this tool is supposed to make everything all better and it turns the bong into like a saxophone and turns him drinking beer into like, I need to go buy some dungarees!
2031000	2035000	We'll have to find it later on on Break or something so you guys can play it because it's pretty humorous.
2036000	2042000	We'll look for it. Awesome, awesome. Alright, well that's going to do it for my gaming week. I don't want to talk about a whole lot of other stuff so let's get into some other stuff tonight.
2042000	2048000	Housekeeping, don't have a whole lot to add here. Are we doing a show on Halloween? That's one thing I've got to figure out.
2049000	2052000	I'd rather not. I thought we were going to go to the Winchester Mystery House.
2053000	2058000	Well, I've got to work the next day. That's my problem. Stupid words.
2059000	2065000	I don't know, I've been to the Winchester Mystery House. You should tell them that you celebrated a religious holiday and that you're exhausted from carousing.
2066000	2068000	Instead it'll be boring in the dark.
2068000	2071000	Well we'll see, I don't know. I love the Winchester Mystery House.
2072000	2077000	We will probably pre-tape, I'm going to imagine, that week. So we'll work something out. That sound right guys? We'll probably pre-tape that week.
2078000	2082000	Pre-tape sounds fine. But we won't be here on Halloween night itself. Otherwise it shows us on schedule as usual.
2083000	2089000	And of course follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R, speaking of if you want to be like my mom. My mom doesn't know about the O-L-R, I don't think.
2090000	2094000	And you can follow us on Facebook. Now she does! Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2094000	2106000	I was going to mention one part of my gaming week, I got a new laptop. And it's awesome. It's an Asus G60JX, which is just a Core i5 PC.
2107000	2116000	Core i5s are weird. Actually all those new core systems with the hypothetical threads and, oh we only overclock your system when it's not running hot and that kind of stuff.
2117000	2121000	Strange. But hey, it runs Grand Theft Auto. That's all I really needed to do.
2121000	2126000	Does that complete your life? It does. For now.
2127000	2133000	Our pal Bobby Blackwolf from before us here at Orange Lounge Radio says he will be doing a show because they don't get any trick-or-treaters where he's at.
2134000	2142000	I am the trick-or-treater. That's why we're not having a show. But that's okay. Bobby will be doing his marathon show on Halloween.
2142000	2151000	I've learned something about, Rob, since I've become a Jew I've learned something about Halloween. You go shopping for costumes after Halloween so you can use them for porn.
2152000	2155000	I'm actually deciding between two costumes right now.
2156000	2162000	I'm sure you could use them for porn too. I guess my Star Trek uniform would be good for sci-fi porn.
2163000	2170000	Seriously, we went to a party USA or whatever, it's like this big ol' party store, they have tons of costumes and stuff. Or party city, whatever.
2170000	2178000	See, we wanted to get Josh a Darth Vader costume. That would be great. That would just be so awesome.
2179000	2184000	No, we couldn't do that. I can't believe you're gonna dress your baby up as Darth Vader. You know what would be great?
2185000	2190000	We almost gave him the middle name, Vader. They don't call him Master Vader.
2191000	2196000	No, no, no. Put him in a brown onesie and he could be Darth Tater.
2196000	2204000	Darth Tater? Not bad. No, but anyways, there was a wall of sexy costumes that they had.
2205000	2206000	For babies?
2207000	2208000	No, not for babies.
2209000	2211000	I'm gonna get you a pedobear costume.
2212000	2216000	Dude, that would be awesome to dress him up like Pedobear.
2217000	2219000	You're gonna dress a baby up as Pedobear?
2220000	2221000	That would be hilarious.
2222000	2223000	No, we're not.
2223000	2225000	I'm calling CPS right now.
2226000	2228000	I would contribute to the baby pedobear fund.
2229000	2232000	No, that would be funny. No, actually, I think that they are...
2233000	2239000	She had a costume for him that her mom bought him. I think it was a bear, but it wasn't Pedobear.
2240000	2241000	They just don't sell those.
2242000	2246000	No, but they have a wall of sexy costumes. It's ridiculous stuff.
2247000	2251000	Optimus Prime. Sexy Optimus Prime. I'm sorry, it's just weird.
2251000	2253000	I've seen sexy Chewbacca recently.
2254000	2258000	Sexy Brian the dog. It's like, no, that does not need to be sexy.
2259000	2261000	Spongebob. I mean, it's like, what?
2262000	2265000	Spongebob. I mean, seriously, I guess, you know...
2266000	2267000	Spongebob, no pants?
2268000	2275000	The demand for slutty costumes is great, I guess, you know, and maybe there's women that love Optimus Prime and love loose sex.
2276000	2279000	New vibrator attachment for your transparent socks?
2279000	2282000	Only if she makes the wah-wah-wah-wah noise.
2283000	2285000	All right, chatroom, chat.orangewise.com.
2286000	2289000	Tigerclaw says, Loki should dress his baby as Mario to match his bedroom.
2290000	2291000	You know, a toad costume would be cute, though.
2292000	2293000	Aww, that would be cute.
2294000	2297000	We've been thinking about that because he has the wonderful mushroom hat that my coworker got.
2298000	2299000	There you go.
2300000	2302000	So we could do that. I threw out Mario as an idea.
2302000	2308000	I don't know, we haven't really decided yet, but she doesn't want to buy costumes because they're not really expensive.
2309000	2313000	But he's only going to wear them once, and a lot of the costumes that they have for babies are really fucking warm.
2314000	2316000	And because he's inside, I mean, he's going to be bacon in that thing.
2317000	2318000	And they're all polyester and stuff.
2319000	2321000	Because they have, like, a hot dog costume, which is really funny.
2322000	2323000	You know what would be great?
2324000	2325000	The Starman.
2326000	2327000	Oh, the little star.
2327000	2332000	Wasn't Maggie in an episode of The Simpsons dressed up as a star?
2333000	2334000	I didn't even remember that.
2335000	2337000	I used to love The Simpsons back when it was first on.
2338000	2346000	See, that's the great thing about babies, because you can dress them in, you know, embarrassing outfits, and they don't really understand until they're 18 and you get out the pictures.
2347000	2349000	I was thinking 10.
2350000	2355000	You've seen on Facebook where my mother posted pictures of me and my brothers in our old Halloween costumes.
2355000	2356000	Oh, yes. Good times.
2357000	2358000	My brother was a popple.
2359000	2361000	I sort of remember what a popple is.
2362000	2363000	What were you?
2364000	2365000	Jane of the Jungle.
2366000	2368000	I was wearing that leopard print thing.
2369000	2370000	Alright, Jane of the Jungle.
2371000	2372000	We're going to get into some news in a little bit.
2373000	2378000	Wait, I want to ask you, though, quickly, and then I want to ask Jessica another question to do some more reminiscing about the DDR days.
2378000	2388000	But I want to ask you feedback on Halloween costume, because I know I'm emceeing a Rocky show either Friday or Saturday. I think I'm doing it Friday.
2389000	2390000	I'm going to be doing that, so I need a costume for that.
2391000	2392000	So I'm deciding between two.
2393000	2398000	I want to dress up as a cheerleader from Glee, but then...
2399000	2400000	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
2401000	2404000	And so I can come out on stage and say, hey, I look for my Halloween costume. I'm a cheerleader from Glee.
2404000	2410000	And then turn around and I'll have a bunch of bullet holes in my back and say, that is fantastic, after the Rocky episode aired.
2411000	2414000	I would go for that, because normally, you know, I can't stay on the show.
2415000	2420000	Okay, then here's my other thing, is that my second choice is that I want to dress up as Allison from Intervention.
2421000	2425000	She was the girl that inhaled the computer duster. It's like I'm walking on sunshine!
2426000	2428000	And I'm thinking of that, too, and I can't decide.
2429000	2430000	Would people get it, though?
2430000	2433000	If I had the computer duster and said that a lot, they might.
2434000	2436000	I'm still taking submissions, though. I need some good ideas.
2437000	2438000	You could be towel-y.
2439000	2440000	Towel-y? Just get a big giant towel and put it over your head.
2441000	2443000	People might take that the wrong way and call me a racist. I don't know about that.
2444000	2446000	Towel-y? From South Park, right?
2447000	2449000	Yeah. How would they call you a racist?
2450000	2451000	You don't have to roll it up into a cone for your head.
2452000	2455000	My original plan was to be Dr. Horrible, but that would have taken some time.
2456000	2457000	That would be fun.
2457000	2462000	All right. Jessica, before we get into some gaming news, which I know we've only been on the air about...
2463000	2464000	You can be sexy Optimus Prime!
2465000	2469000	Sexy fat Optimus Prime. That'll be fun. With my butt hanging out.
2470000	2472000	You never know. That might turn somebody on.
2473000	2478000	Oh, boy. All right. It won't be Alan. He'll be like, what are you doing? What, what, what are you doing?
2479000	2481000	I thought we'd gotten past all of this, Rob.
2482000	2485000	We're only 40 minutes into the show. I haven't hit gaming news yet, but that's okay.
2485000	2487000	Let's ask Jessica some more DDR fun stuff.
2488000	2497000	How did you get from being a DDR fangirl, I-can't-pass-boom-boom-dollar-the-first-time to I-am-an-administrator-on-DDR-freak?
2498000	2499000	What happened? How did you land the...
2500000	2501000	I was a bitch.
2502000	2508000	No, actually, it was mostly Jamie's influence that kind of got me into the moderatorship.
2508000	2514000	We were all, of course, part of DDR Freak forums, and through my friendship with Jamie,
2515000	2519000	she introduced me to a lot of the Bay Area people, and Bay Area people talked with other Bay Area people,
2520000	2522000	and actually, humorously enough...
2523000	2524000	So you were part of a clique?
2525000	2530000	Kinda, yeah. But humorously enough, J-Dog did not want me as a moderator,
2531000	2536000	and Sinon actually kind of went behind his back and just, boop, here you go.
2536000	2542000	Here you go. So I was given my moderatorship because of Jamie and Inuan.
2543000	2546000	The mod that was not meant to be. Oh boy, I didn't know that.
2547000	2551000	Yeah, and I was introduced to Sinon and just kind of became a mod from there,
2552000	2558000	and ever since, like, there was a period of time when J-Dog and I really did not get along at all because of it,
2559000	2562000	because he always felt that I shouldn't have been a mod, and she's not ready to be a mod yet,
2562000	2567000	and I know we need more people from all over, but I don't think we need another Sacramento person.
2568000	2570000	Is there trials you have to go through to become a moderator?
2571000	2573000	No, you just need to be able to follow the rules.
2574000	2575000	Be a good babysitter.
2576000	2577000	You didn't have to kiss J-Dog or anything?
2578000	2578000	No.
2579000	2580000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2581000	2582000	No, no kissing the co.
2583000	2585000	We did have a very epic trip to Las Vegas.
2586000	2587000	Yes, and we were stalked.
2588000	2590000	Hold on, I want to hear how she got from moderator to administrator.
2590000	2592000	Well, this is before that.
2593000	2594000	Okay, okay. Alright, fine, fine.
2595000	2598000	But no, we'll skip, we'll come back.
2599000	2606000	As for becoming administrator, it was kind of, I was helping out with a lot of the website stuff.
2607000	2613000	I was available a lot more than a lot of the people, and Spike, who was the administrator at the time,
2613000	2620000	he really was having a hard time keeping up with things, and I had become an administrator because of my,
2621000	2623000	you know, my helping out type of stuff.
2624000	2629000	I was, you know, doing some of the, working on some of the web stuff, keeping things handled there,
2630000	2636000	doing the DDR Freak radio, and making sure that, you know, certain people stayed banned, and what have you.
2636000	2643000	And because of all that, I got my administratorship, and then Spike decided that he just couldn't dedicate enough time anymore,
2644000	2651000	and it was basically put to a little mini vote between, like, the other, you know, the other big wigs,
2652000	2654000	and I kind of became head administrator.
2655000	2656000	The girls at the Mean Girls head table, or whatever?
2657000	2659000	Yeah, so yeah, I became the head bitch in charge.
2660000	2660000	Alright.
2661000	2663000	And that's where I stayed for probably a couple years.
2663000	2671000	What was the meanest thing you ever had to do, or I guess I should say the bitchiest thing you ever had to do as an administrator?
2672000	2673000	Oh, God.
2674000	2678000	Well, it's, okay, here's another humorous story.
2679000	2681000	A lot of people remember Pyro Freeze.
2682000	2684000	Oh, guh.
2685000	2686000	Yes.
2687000	2689000	And that's the reaction that most people have when mentioning Pyro Freeze.
2689000	2698000	Um, yeah, he was a troll little lolol to the extreme, and we had to ban him,
2699000	2704000	and he would evade the ban, and ban him again, evade the ban, ban him again, and this just went on and on and on.
2705000	2711000	You know, the unfortunate part is that he's very, very smart when it comes to, you know, spoofing IPs and what have you.
2712000	2713000	Really smart guy.
2713000	2720000	And he finally decided he was bored with it, left over to DDREI for a while, and then just kind of dropped off the face of the planet.
2721000	2727000	And then he came back, and he kind of apologized to me for being such a troll for so long.
2728000	2729000	Like, I grew up, basically?
2730000	2734000	Yeah, basically I grew up, I was, you know, in my early 20s, and I was being a total jackass,
2734000	2742000	and we started talking, and I started letting him stay on the forum a little bit more,
2743000	2749000	and then he and I just kept getting closer and closer as friends, and we ended up going to meet up in Las Vegas.
2750000	2757000	So I actually met one of our biggest trolls in Las Vegas and had a good time, we gambled.
2758000	2759000	You didn't sleep with him, did you?
2759000	2766000	Wait, oh my god!
2767000	2769000	Just say no. If you want to say no, just say no.
2770000	2772000	But he had a really big dick.
2773000	2775000	Wait a minute! I can't believe it!
2776000	2777000	He's really cute!
2778000	2780000	For the record, I had no idea. I had no idea.
2781000	2783000	Rob's face is a special shade of red right now.
2784000	2786000	I didn't think she was going to say that, I thought she was going to say shut the fuck up.
2786000	2788000	His face or my face more.
2789000	2792000	You're both, uh, I would say you're complementary shades.
2795000	2797000	Wow, okay!
2798000	2801000	You know what they say, Rob. Keep your friends close, and your friends...
2802000	2803000	And your enemies closer?
2804000	2806000	Oh, he was very close.
2807000	2809000	Yeah, but I'm thinking of like the enemies I had back in the day, and...
2809000	2815000	No. No. No. No. Not even close. No. Just ew. Ew.
2816000	2820000	No, it was one of those situations where we were kind of flirtatious ahead of time, and...
2821000	2826000	One thing led to another, and... Yeah. Stuff.
2827000	2831000	Wow, okay. That was not the light of questioning, I really...
2832000	2833000	Whatever, hey.
2833000	2838000	Well, you know, when the money runs out when you're gambling, what else is there to do in Vegas?
2839000	2842000	But we did come back with a cute story about how we got married.
2843000	2846000	How we were married by Elvis, and everything, but yeah.
2847000	2850000	Nothing came of it, of course, it was just all in good fun, and...
2851000	2857000	It was my, hey, I'm free from debt, so let me put myself into a tiny bit more to start with again.
2858000	2859000	Because I had just gotten a new credit card, so...
2859000	2867000	But it is interesting, all joking and laughing and lols aside, it is interesting how, you know, people really do kind of grow up and mature, and it can really change.
2868000	2869000	Oh, he 100% did, and... That's great.
2870000	2876000	Yeah, he's an awesome guy, and I wish him well, I haven't even really talked to him for the past couple of years, but, you know, he's a cool guy.
2877000	2886000	I think I remember the truce happening, because we started seeing him more and more on the forums, and we talked about it too.
2886000	2895000	Well, yeah, I was trying to, I actually remember posting something in the moderator forum saying, hey guys, just back off him, you know, he's trying to be good.
2896000	2896000	Interesting.
2897000	2901000	Unlike other people who had been complete assholes on the forum, who got banned, and...
2902000	2903000	Dan's raising his hand.
2904000	2906000	Yes, sweetie, I know that you're a complete asshole.
2907000	2908000	Not on the forums!
2909000	2911000	He says not on the forums.
2912000	2914000	Like a certain guy by the name of Jared.
2914000	2915000	By the name of Jared.
2916000	2919000	And actually, I banned Tran.
2920000	2921000	Oh, yeah, Tranpawa.
2922000	2929000	Good times. I love how suddenly it's talked into, like, talking about all the trolls of the DDR Freak days, and which ones of them Jessica's slept with, and which ones she has.
2930000	2933000	I have Kilroy on my friends list on Facebook now, which is kind of humorous.
2934000	2935000	Alright, this is funny.
2935000	2943000	Yeah, so if you are a web troll out there, just know if you turn over a new leaf, you might have some surprises in store.
2944000	2945000	Thanks, Rob.
2946000	2947000	You know what?
2948000	2954000	Next time some damn story about Lolo or something gets brought up on Undersedation Live, it'll be well deserved.
2955000	2958000	And I do have the caveat that this was at least, like, six years ago.
2959000	2960000	Yeah, oh yeah.
2961000	2962000	I don't think that would apply to the newt.
2962000	2965000	Alright. Let's not go there.
2966000	2967000	I didn't say it. I said it backwards.
2968000	2970000	Yes. Hi. Getting into gaming news.
2971000	2974000	Hey, yes, let's do, let's do, we're only, like, an hour into the show. Haven't even touched on gaming news yet.
2975000	2976000	Loki! Hey, no, it's okay.
2977000	2978000	Trust me, it was great.
2979000	2983000	Loki, put down the I, Os, and let's talk about gaming news.
2984000	2988000	You sure you don't want to talk about enemies that you've slept with or anything?
2989000	2990000	I don't know if I have any.
2990000	2994000	Um, definitely not, definitely not of the online DDR freaks sort.
2995000	2996000	I buried mine.
2997000	2998000	But I can't even, no, I mean.
2999000	3001000	Have you ever had enemies? Actually, I didn't really post much on DDR freaks, so.
3002000	3004000	Oh, everybody was my enemy. That's the other problem, so.
3005000	3006000	Yeah.
3007000	3009000	And now they're all close friends. No kidding.
3010000	3016000	Um, so there's a new game from Valve that was announced, Defense of the Ancients 2.
3016000	3020000	And apparently it's going to be including all the 100 plus characters.
3021000	3024000	Um, and I guess that's from the original game.
3025000	3026000	Uh, and new social features.
3027000	3032000	And, um, the game itself, of course, is kind of an action RTS.
3033000	3036000	And, uh, honestly, I've never played it, nor have heard anything about it.
3037000	3040000	But, I mean, I remember the same thing with Team Fortress 2.
3041000	3043000	It's like, Team Fortress 2? What was Team Fortress 1?
3043000	3046000	Well, this is interesting, then more and more comes out about it.
3047000	3049000	And, you know, if it's Valve-making, I'm sure it's going to be awesome.
3050000	3055000	But, um, unfortunately I'll have to wait until, uh, 2011 to actually be able to play the game.
3056000	3061000	But, um, I'm sure if they're making a sequel to it, it was probably insanely popular to begin with.
3062000	3064000	Well, yeah, Defense of the Ancients was a huge Warcraft 3 thing.
3065000	3066000	Yeah.
3067000	3068000	Yeah, so that's, uh, that's pretty cool.
3069000	3070000	Yeah.
3070000	3077000	And, uh, it's going to be sort of, because, you know, since Warcraft has kind of gone the way of World of Warcraft, which is not an RTS,
3078000	3082000	you basically have Starcraft and you have, you know, your handful of other RTSs on the PC.
3083000	3087000	Uh, it'll be really, this, this is going to be, you know, especially the fact that, A, it's coming from Valve.
3088000	3091000	It's a, it's a mod that tons and tons and tons of Warcraft players are very familiar with.
3092000	3095000	It's going to be very interesting to see how that kind of translates into a spin-off game.
3096000	3097000	I, I bet it'll be really good.
3097000	3099000	And very successful the way Team Fortress 2 was.
3100000	3104000	Absolutely. Especially if they bundle it in an Uber pack of games like they did, you know, with Team Fortress 2.
3105000	3109000	Well, I don't even think that's necessary, but just the support that they put towards their games, I mean,
3110000	3113000	like it even Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2 or Team Fortress.
3114000	3121000	I mean, it's just so much damn support after the fact that, you know, they really keep up interest in the game long after it's come out.
3121000	3126000	You know, maybe there will be like a sequel to the Orange Box that could be this and, uh, I don't know,
3127000	3128000	like maybe Half-Life Episode 3, just saying.
3129000	3131000	Sequel to the Orange Box, the blue ball.
3134000	3139000	Alright. Uh, wah wah wah. Alright, uh, speaking of wah wah and sad things,
3140000	3145000	the developers behind Xbox 360's game rooms is shutting their doors.
3145000	3150000	That's right. Chrome Studios, they're located in Australia. They are shutting down.
3151000	3152000	It's a done deal, unfortunately.
3153000	3157000	Sadly, this was sort of something you kind of saw coming because they've been scaling back for a while.
3158000	3160000	They closed some of their studios throughout Australia earlier in the year.
3161000	3165000	The remaining staff at the studios in Brisbane and Melbourne have been let go.
3166000	3170000	Both studios are closing their doors tomorrow morning, which would be today in Australia.
3170000	3174000	They're like, scale back, way back. No, really, all the way back. You're gone.
3175000	3176000	It's the future in Australia.
3177000	3181000	The sad thing is that they were Australia's largest development house and so now they are gone.
3182000	3186000	Of course there are some lingering questions as to what's going to happen to Game Room
3187000	3188000	because they were kind of the biggest things behind Game Room.
3189000	3193000	I promise you, just as many releases on Game Room now as there...
3194000	3196000	Yeah, they'll keep scaling it back to like one game a week.
3196000	3199000	Well, I mean, it should be said there are still games being released for Game Room.
3200000	3200000	There are?
3201000	3205000	Oh, yeah. They've been pretty good about doing them every week.
3206000	3213000	I'm not going to say they're always good games or well known, but actually I believe I was looking at what was coming up next week.
3214000	3218000	Let me look real quick here. There's actually a list available on Wikipedia.
3219000	3222000	So I don't know if I would say doom and gloom in the end of Game Room just yet because they still have.
3222000	3228000	For October 13th, Game Pack 10 gets more releases that include Radar Lock...
3229000	3230000	Oh, no. That was this week. I'm sorry.
3231000	3232000	What was on deck for next week?
3233000	3234000	Oh, here we go.
3235000	3242000	Breakout on the Atari, Double Dunk on the Atari, and Jackal, the arcade game from Konami, which was a classic game of the week before.
3243000	3244000	So, I mean, they still have some...
3245000	3246000	Even though two of those releases are kind of...
3247000	3249000	Okay, whatever. You do still have a pretty good memorable title in there.
3249000	3253000	And that's going to be Game Pack 11 because I think that's the start of a new Game Pack.
3254000	3256000	So I don't think you can say that Game Room's really dead.
3257000	3262000	Seeing as the Microsoft logo's on that, it would make sense to me that the assets will get transformed over to Microsoft.
3263000	3267000	That might ultimately be a good thing because maybe Microsoft will give it to someone else and say,
3268000	3274000	Here, make this better. Or they will say, We will now write this off. So I don't know what's going to happen.
3275000	3277000	It's sort of on life support right now.
3277000	3283000	It is, but it'll be interesting to see if the sales are good, where there's money to be made.
3284000	3289000	One of Game Room's biggest flaws, besides all the things I've talked about this game way too much on the show,
3290000	3295000	but despite the flaws it has of no online multiplayer at the same time and all that,
3296000	3302000	one of its other biggest drawbacks is no publishers besides Atari and television and Konami seem to be on board.
3302000	3306000	If they could at least get a couple more publishers or some rights to some other games,
3307000	3311000	even if it's Commodore 64, computer games, they could really breathe some life back into this thing,
3312000	3314000	but it'll just depend on do they want to, are the sales there,
3315000	3321000	but even if they're only selling 50 copies of Jackal, which I bet they're selling more than that,
3322000	3323000	It's a fucking ROM. It doesn't take that much.
3324000	3325000	It's free money.
3326000	3327000	They build the emulator and that's it.
3327000	3332000	Well, they have to, to be fair, they have to do art for the cabinet, they have to QA to make sure it doesn't glitch.
3333000	3334000	There is some work.
3335000	3337000	Art for the cabinet? That stuff's already out there.
3338000	3340000	But they have to make it into the Xbox art, you know what I mean?
3341000	3344000	They have to turn what was out there into an actual in-game thing.
3345000	3349000	I'm not saying it's a lot of work, Loki. It doesn't take like a 20-man team to do,
3350000	3352000	but there is some work involved in it.
3353000	3354000	Fine.
3354000	3357000	So it's not completely free. Anyhow.
3358000	3361000	And some spazzinator, PSN in our chatroom at chat.order-sons-ready.com says,
3362000	3364000	Game Room is one of my favorite games on my 360 and Defective Candy says,
3365000	3366000	Baw, I loved Game Room.
3367000	3371000	There's a lot I do still like about Game Room, you know, and I'm kind of sad to see that it might be done.
3372000	3374000	But I don't, you know, Black Wolf in chat says,
3375000	3379000	Even the games, quote, nobody plays has at least 400 people on the leaderboard.
3379000	3385000	So, you know, 400 times 3, $1200. That's still something.
3386000	3389000	He said he was playing in television pinball, and that was one of the...
3390000	3391000	Wow. Alright, anyhow.
3392000	3393000	And I agree with Rama, we need Mercs.
3394000	3397000	Let's move on to some more gaming news, Dark Sakura, and we'll see.
3398000	3400000	I don't think, I would not put the nail in the coffin of Game Room just yet.
3401000	3404000	It might be on life support, as Jamie said, but it's not flatlined yet.
3404000	3416000	Well, speaking in terms of games that have previously been on their last legs that may or may not have a forever title attached to it coming out one day.
3417000	3419000	I'm still not holding my breath for the record.
3420000	3421000	It'll be this spring.
3422000	3423000	I'm not holding my breath.
3423000	3434000	At any rate, there is a non-commercial license out to go ahead and make the fan-made Duke Nukem Next Gen.
3435000	3439000	That is basically a remake of Duke Nukem 3D using the Unreal Engine.
3440000	3444000	And I watched some of the film of it, and it looks sweet.
3445000	3450000	Duke Nukem 3D, I have to say, was probably my...
3450000	3453000	You know what? I think I played this before I played Doom.
3454000	3455000	Really?
3456000	3459000	And it was also my first LAN game that I ever played.
3460000	3462000	Where you get to do the little voice macros in it. It was really great.
3462000	3479000	Anyway, he was also working on Next Gen remakes of Daikatana and Sin, but this one was given the green light, so he was going to make a multiplayer demo of it that should be out fairly soon.
3480000	3484000	And the full version will be out, he says, when it's done.
3485000	3486000	And it's just a code frame.
3487000	3488000	Check this out.
3488000	3491000	Go ahead. That's actually really cool for the developers to do.
3492000	3494000	I'm very surprised that they're not trying to do it themselves.
3495000	3503000	Well, I'm very surprised that they aren't going to put this on a console, because seriously, an HD remake of Duke Nukem 3D would be fucking awesome.
3504000	3506000	Well, it would be a little redundant, because there's already Duke Nukem 3D.
3507000	3514000	Who cares, though? I mean, a little redundant. I mean, all these HD versions of games, and that's just making the sprites look prettier. This is actually rebuilding the game.
3515000	3516000	It looks gorgeous.
3516000	3521000	Oh, yeah, they definitely kind of rebuilt that first level in there, and I know this doesn't translate well to radio, but you're kind of seeing a...
3522000	3523000	I'm going to link the video in the chatroom.
3524000	3530000	You're kind of seeing a remake of that first level, where you're on the rooftops and things kind of crash down. You sort of see a remake of that here in this engine.
3531000	3532000	That's pretty cool.
3533000	3534000	It moves very smoothly.
3535000	3538000	I'd be very cool if you can kind of get the multiplayer and everything working in this.
3539000	3540000	That would be fantastic.
3541000	3544000	Again, I'm just surprised the developers sort of said, yeah, we're not going to do it. Go ahead.
3544000	3555000	You know? And kind of was a step above the whole King's Quest Silver Lining debacle, where that game got shut down, and then it didn't get shut down, and all that stuff. That was very cool.
3556000	3568000	I think this is... I would play this. And normally, first person games like that, especially ones that are actually 3D models, make me really motion sick. I would still play this.
3569000	3572000	This would probably be my new Portal.
3572000	3585000	It would be fun, especially with the multiplayer and everything. But I don't know. Some things I think we tend to see through the retro-colored glasses, a little play on the rose-colored glasses, retro-colored glasses, because I know when I played Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live, I was like, oh, this is cool.
3586000	3591000	And then I was like, oh, but I don't know. It's just not the same as it was when I was 18 in the college dorms.
3592000	3594000	Kind of like playing Atari now versus playing Atari when you were first...
3595000	3598000	There's some games that never lose their charm in Atari.
3598000	3604000	You make a good point, but I don't play it... I don't play it as much as I used to when I was a kid, but it's still kind of cool to have.
3605000	3611000	Because, yeah, sometimes I'll get bored, and I'll just kind of go into game room, and I'm like, oh, let me just play Keystone Capers for a minute. And then I'm done.
3612000	3620000	I don't stay up all night playing it like I used to when I was six, and we would have people in little sleepovers and whatever, but it's still kind of cool to have.
3620000	3628000	Anyhow. Alright, moving on to some more gaming news, release dates, Classic Game of the Week coming up in a little while as well, but first, Loki.
3629000	3640000	Yes, Red Dead Redemption, of course, is getting its new expansion pack. Coming out October 26th, the Undead Nightmare brings zombies into the wonderful game of Red Dead Redemption.
3640000	3656000	And that's all sorts of awesome by itself, but if you happen to, say, want to skip buying Red Dead Redemption, just want to get straight to the zombies, screw all this single player storyline,
3657000	3663000	you can actually purchase a standalone disc that bundles together all of the download content.
3663000	3674000	Undead Nightmare pack, that's coming with Outlaws to the End co-op mission pack, Legends and Killers pack, Liars and Cheats pack, and the multiplayer free roam mode.
3674000	3693000	That's going to be in stores, I guess, it's a couple weeks actually, for 30 bucks, and I believe that's only on Xbox 360, but it may very well be coming to both platforms, but as of right now I know it's coming to Xbox 360, but that's cool.
3694000	3695000	Because zombies have to be in everything, right?
3696000	3699000	Hell yeah. You have a zombie horse, you can fight zombie bears.
3700000	3702000	With your zombie guns?
3702000	3705000	The guns are not living.
3706000	3712000	How well does the whole DLC in stores thing do? I don't know if you have any insight to that from your distribution perspective, but does that actually do well?
3713000	3720000	This is different though, and yes, they do sell, but this is separate, you do not need the original game to play this.
3721000	3722000	Oh, I missed that, sorry.
3722000	3736000	It's just the online component only to the game. Well, you can technically play the free roam offline, but there's no storyline. It's just, here's the world, go play. That's it.
3737000	3741000	That's kind of neat. A nice alternative, I guess, for those that maybe don't even want to play the single player.
3741000	3757000	Well, you really should play the single player, because it's really awesome, but yeah, that's cool, and I haven't really been buying any of the download content for Red Dead Redemption, but I may have to check this out, because I do like me some zombies.
3757000	3771000	Alright, well something else we like here at Orange On Radio, of course, is the old school music games, and one of those music games, you know, we've been talking a lot about DDR tonight, but of course there was another game that was very near and dear to a lot of our hearts, and that was Beatmania 2DX.
3772000	3780000	And Beatmania 2DX, you may or may not know, it's still going in Japan, and even as machines trickle over here to the US, it's going on here too.
3780000	3792000	But in the homes, they've stopped somewhat in Japan, and it's been a while. It's been a year since Beatmania 2DX 16, what was it, Princess was 16th? I don't even remember.
3793000	3793000	Princess.
3793000	3811000	Yes, Beatmania 2DX 16 was like a year ago that that came out, and they did say it would be the last PlayStation 2 release. Well being that it's been a year, and no sign of Beatmania 2DX 17, which came out in arcades some time ago, and now what, they've already announced 18 as well, so they're getting ahead.
3811000	3825000	Some Japanese fans actually took it up to create a petition saying, hey, we want Beatmania 2DX 17, Sirius, to come out for the consoles, either be PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 or what have you.
3826000	3834000	But see that's the problem though, is they have, before it was just, you know, take the same engine, add new songs. Done. Reskin it, done.
3835000	3837000	And the chat room was yelling at me, it was Empress, not Princess.
3837000	3841000	Thank God, because Princess is really gay sounding. No, I was gonna say-
3842000	3843000	And what's wrong with that?
3844000	3845000	No, there should be Diva Edition.
3846000	3849000	What's wrong with that is I don't think you'd have as many players playing Princess.
3850000	3855000	Beatmania 2DX 19 style, super pretty happy fun edition.
3856000	3857000	I'd play that.
3858000	3859000	Super gay unicorn edition.
3860000	3862000	Always have fun at Beatmania.
3863000	3863000	Exactly.
3864000	3865000	I'd have to play that actually.
3865000	3866000	That's easy.
3867000	3868000	But only that shader.
3869000	3870000	That has nothing to do with the game.
3871000	3879000	See that's what I think the problem is right now, they don't have a brand new piece of software to work off if they don't have anything made before.
3880000	3885000	So they're trying to create something new in order for it to support Beatmania.
3886000	3890000	And really they could just upskill the stuff that they have, but whatever.
3890000	3900000	Well regardless, some Japanese fans decided to get together and start this online petition which started circulating its way on some of the big American sites like Bimani style and some of those as well.
3901000	3902000	Is, hey, you need to release this game over here.
3903000	3908000	What's interesting though, you might go, oh yeah, online petitions, yeah, you're gonna have a lot of luck with those because those always do the trick.
3909000	3912000	Unless it's Betty White and Saturday Night Live, it's not gonna happen. Right?
3913000	3914000	I was part of that one.
3915000	3916000	Me too.
3916000	3922000	But, here's the thing, is that you might remember Beatmania 2DX 7th style many years ago.
3923000	3924000	There was a huge break between 6th style and 7th style.
3925000	3932000	7th style never came out until Konami was like, okay well if X, Y number of people pre-order the game then we'll make it in a limited, I don't know.
3933000	3935000	But they finally ended up releasing it and it was a big deal.
3936000	3940000	I mean it kept the series going from 7 through 16 on the Playstation 2 which is a very long time.
3941000	3944000	And Konami actually responded to this.
3944000	3946000	Konami has written a little response.
3947000	3951000	They actually used the little Twitter tag thing, CS serious or whatever.
3952000	3960000	They put, were another 2DX CS game to be released, would you like it to be on PS2, PS3, or another system?
3961000	3969000	This might tie in a little bit too and I think something that's not really touched on in this particular article I'm looking at but I remember on Naoki Madea's Facebook,
3969000	3974000	he actually was asking, and he does a lot of the stuff in music games, he asked a very similar question.
3975000	3980000	He did like a little survey, like what systems do you play games on, do you want to see games on PS3, what games do you want to see?
3981000	3988000	So Konami is kind of exploring this a little bit and I think, I hope anyway, a lot of people responded to this saying PS3, PS3, do it, do it, do it.
3989000	3993000	It was a great thing, hopefully it would be region free because PS3 is region free.
3993000	3998000	It would be region free. You wouldn't even have to worry about having to get a Japanese PlayStation 3.
3999000	4001000	I've got pilot controllers in the vault.
4002000	4003000	Good times.
4004000	4005000	Just collecting dust.
4006000	4007000	Region locked either though, so.
4008000	4012000	Orange Right in our chat room says, is CS serious endorsed by President Cat?
4013000	4014000	Oh, President Cat.
4014000	4024000	I think so, but remember CS serious is coming from Japan and President Cat would be a US thing even though he could be like the world's president, so I think there would need to be like Ambassador Puppy or something.
4025000	4026000	And President Cat's a girl.
4027000	4028000	Alright.
4029000	4030000	Maybe that's why we didn't get President Cat over here.
4031000	4036000	And Black Wolf, our pal, is correcting us saying it was 15,000 pre-orders because he was one of them.
4038000	4040000	I knew a couple people that were in on that too.
4040000	4047000	So it will be interesting to see if Konami continues with this. I think they will. My gut tells me they'll do it and it will be PS3.
4048000	4049000	We'll see.
4050000	4051000	And I'll probably buy it.
4052000	4054000	I think it will be multi-platform because they're not going to put all their eggs in PS3.
4055000	4063000	Well if it's Japan only then yeah it would be PS3, but if it does come out over here it will be multi-platform because PS3 sales over here aren't.
4064000	4065000	I don't think they'll bother with it over here.
4065000	4072000	Honestly I think what they're going to do is do it on PS3 for wide release in Japan and do a limited release on PS3 in the United States.
4073000	4074000	That would make sense.
4075000	4076000	That's what I see happening.
4077000	4079000	How many copies did they make of Beatmania when they brought it out over here?
4080000	4085000	And does Beatmania's 2DX still use licensed music? It's more about like the controllers would be the biggest pain in the butt.
4086000	4092000	Well they've got controllers. If they used the redone model for the controllers they really were a lot better.
4092000	4101000	Yeah but now it's all USB on the PS3. You have to have a converter which either way you're looking at some type of peripheral.
4102000	4103000	I'm sure they could rework the controller.
4104000	4105000	They make them.
4106000	4111000	There's also those multi-converter things so you can use other controllers on different systems.
4112000	4113000	If they haven't been locked out by Sony.
4114000	4117000	Or just use your guitar. Just play 2DX on your guitar. Freaks.
4117000	4121000	Not guitar freaks. Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero. Whatever.
4122000	4127000	I was really hoping to have DJ Hero 2 this week. I got cock blocked at work unfortunately.
4128000	4129000	I'm sorry to hear it.
4130000	4131000	Life sucks sometimes.
4132000	4134000	It's like if I can't get it that early I don't want it.
4135000	4138000	Well how about something else though about Guitar Hero since we brought it up.
4139000	4141000	It sucks. Actually it's dying.
4142000	4143000	It's actually dying.
4143000	4146000	Uh oh. Dying. Um.
4151000	4159000	Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock sold 86,000 copies its first week in the US on all formats.
4161000	4163000	Yeah here's the numbers for the other ones.
4164000	4168000	Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 units.
4169000	4171000	Is that overall or in its first week?
4171000	4172000	In its first week.
4173000	4175000	These are first months that I'm going through now.
4176000	4177000	This was just the first week. The 86,000.
4178000	4179000	The rest of these are going to be.
4180000	4186000	Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 in its first month in 2009.
4187000	4191000	Guitar Hero World Tour sold 50,000 in its first week in 2008.
4192000	4196000	And Guitar Hero 3 sold 1.4 million units in 5 days.
4197000	4199000	Now these are also going back in time.
4199000	4203000	We're talking 499,000 units in a month for Guitar Hero 5 in 2009.
4204000	4208000	And then in 2008 and before that in 2007.
4209000	4213000	But they're talking about in its first month?
4214000	4214000	No.
4215000	4216000	Its first week.
4217000	4219000	Guitar Hero 5 was in its first month.
4220000	4225000	It sold just under as many units as Guitar Hero World Tour did in a week.
4225000	4228000	Oh. Wow. Okay.
4229000	4233000	And most of these games tend to sell in the first few weeks.
4234000	4238000	Although, couldn't you argue that Guitar Hero is going to have some lasting power through the holidays?
4239000	4240000	Because it's a game that Grandma might buy the kids?
4241000	4242000	I don't know so much.
4243000	4249000	I mean, really, if it was going to draw in the business, the numbers would have stayed steady, I think.
4250000	4251000	No one cared about Guitar Hero this year.
4252000	4253000	And the reason why is because they...
4253000	4254000	Rock Band 3?
4255000	4257000	No, not really, because a lot of people don't care about Rock Band 3 either.
4258000	4261000	They kind of have the mentality, oh, music games, that genre is dead.
4262000	4263000	They're dumb.
4264000	4273000	Well, actually going to say that, Harmonix actually had to convince people that the whole genre wasn't declining.
4274000	4277000	Basically the CEO was saying, and I quote,
4278000	4281000	I absolutely do not believe that rhythm action gaming has reached its peak.
4281000	4291000	But, eh, they're saying in the UK that Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock launched at a 6 on the list and rated a 7 out of 10.
4292000	4295000	Well, here's the thing is, I think Guitar Hero is just getting stale to a lot of people.
4296000	4298000	I mean, what did this new game bring to the table?
4299000	4302000	They brought transforming characters.
4303000	4306000	We get a keytar in Rock Band.
4306000	4310000	Here's why Guitar Hero 5 sold more than Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.
4311000	4317000	Guitar Hero 5, for the first month, included Guitar Hero Van Halen for free.
4318000	4322000	The new Guitar Hero included a Soundgarden album.
4323000	4326000	Who gives a crap about the Soundgarden album?
4327000	4328000	I would have gotten the Soundgarden album.
4329000	4330000	Okay, let me put it this way.
4331000	4334000	I'm a Van Hagar fan, so I would have picked Soundgarden over...
4334000	4339000	But it was a game that people would be able to get their hands on months before it was released.
4340000	4341000	A $12 CD versus a $40 game, I get it.
4342000	4343000	But keep in mind...
4344000	4345000	They charge full price.
4346000	4347000	Assholes.
4348000	4352000	Just as many copies sold in a week a year before, and it didn't have a pack in a bonus game.
4353000	4359000	Might I remind everybody, once again, and I can't say Activision is the only culprit for this, but...
4359000	4369000	Wii games, or Wii versions of Guitar Hero, and Wii versions of Rock Band, and Wii versions of DJ Hero,
4370000	4375000	and the Wii versions of the Tony Hawk Shred game that's coming out, all $60 retail.
4376000	4377000	Wow.
4378000	4380000	Despite the fact that most Wii games top out at $50.
4381000	4384000	Their excuse, oh, we need more money for music licensing.
4385000	4387000	Wait, wait, wait, why is Tony Hawk more expensive then?
4387000	4388000	Cuz, you know...
4389000	4390000	Cuz we wanna pay the Deftones more money.
4391000	4393000	Cuz no one's gonna buy it anyway, so, you know, whatever.
4394000	4394000	$1,000,000.
4395000	4396000	Bobby makes a good point in our chat room.
4397000	4399000	BlackWolf in chat.orangetownshreddy.com, live here on this Sunday night, says,
4400000	4402000	Yeah, hey, music games are an oversaturated genre.
4403000	4405000	There are a total of four music games that came out this year.
4406000	4407000	And how many first person shooters?
4408000	4408000	I know, right?
4409000	4410000	Or sports games? Or...
4411000	4412000	You know, just saying.
4413000	4414000	I think what's gonna come down...
4414000	4418000	We'll have to see how Rock Band 3 does, because it's not...
4419000	4421000	I mean, you can't really go off of Green Day Rock Band.
4422000	4423000	Cuz I knew that was gonna be terrible when it first came out.
4424000	4425000	Or when it was first announced.
4426000	4427000	And the Beatles Rock Band, eh...
4428000	4428000	Was awesome?
4429000	4430000	But both are niche. Both are niche.
4431000	4432000	They are niche.
4433000	4434000	Even though the Beatles is like, a big niche, and Green Day is a smaller niche,
4435000	4436000	They're both a little too...
4437000	4438000	They're niche, and that limits the audience.
4439000	4440000	I think Rock Band 3 is gonna be pretty incredible.
4440000	4445000	But I don't think it's gonna be as big of a jump as Rock Band 1 to Rock Band 2.
4446000	4447000	Because a lot of people are like,
4448000	4449000	Well, why do I need the upgrade? Cuz I have all these thousands of songs already.
4450000	4454000	You know, with download content, do I really need 80 songs?
4455000	4457000	I think Rock Band 3 will have the lasting power through Christmas, though.
4458000	4459000	I think Rock Band 3 will be one of those.
4460000	4461000	It's not gonna impress when it first comes out, but it's just gonna...
4462000	4463000	It'll be very steady.
4464000	4465000	It's got the harmony in it, doesn't it?
4466000	4466000	Yeah.
4467000	4468000	So that makes me happy. I'm getting it.
4468000	4471000	It's gonna be the game that people see at parties and want to get at their own house.
4472000	4473000	I'm getting a fucking keyboard.
4474000	4476000	That's one of the key mistakes that this new Guitar Hero...
4477000	4478000	And this is the point I wanted to get to in the beginning.
4479000	4483000	Guitar Hero, the new things it brought to the table were almost all single-player things.
4484000	4487000	But Rock Band 3 is bringing more things to the multiplayer experience.
4488000	4494000	A fast story mode, a new keyboard, these new ways of dropping in and out really quick.
4494000	4497000	Everything it's bringing to the table is for the party.
4498000	4501000	And a new promo-type thing, which, I mean, some people might be interested in that.
4502000	4506000	And with, like, at least the drums and the keyboards, that might kind of teach you how to play that stuff.
4507000	4508000	I guess even the guitar, if you want to spend the money on the guitar.
4509000	4510000	Well, Rob, you remember my birthday?
4511000	4513000	We did nothing but play Rock Band the entire time.
4514000	4517000	And it was fun, and people who were just arriving could just come in and play.
4518000	4520000	And we were cycling people out. It's an easy party game.
4520000	4523000	Tiger C'mon, our chat room, has a good point.
4524000	4528000	Rock Band 3 is going to raise the bar because of its peripherals can be used as real instruments.
4529000	4530000	Guitar Hero will soon follow with their own version.
4531000	4532000	That's a darn good point. We didn't even address that.
4533000	4538000	One thing that Rock Band has that Guitar Hero is not going to have is this whole learn to actually play, or the pro mode.
4539000	4544000	Granted, it's, you know, a little bit controversial, and who knows how many people will actually get to really learn to play from it.
4544000	4549000	But I know me, personally, as someone who played the piano and the keyboard and all that stuff growing up,
4550000	4553000	I am really excited about the pro keyboard mode that's going to be in this game,
4554000	4557000	and the fact that you are actually learning keyboard parts for these songs. That's awesome.
4558000	4560000	Or, someone like Bobby could probably appreciate this.
4561000	4568000	They also have the MIDI controller that you can buy for your MIDI-enabled instruments, and just drop that in straight to the game.
4569000	4570000	Doesn't he have a full MIDI drum set?
4570000	4573000	I believe he does. And probably a keyboard.
4574000	4579000	He's a huge drummer guy. He makes money off some of that stuff, so I imagine he does. He'll say in chat in a minute, I'm sure.
4580000	4583000	He writes his own theme song. He's gotta have some fun toys there.
4584000	4586000	Anyhow, let's travel around the world.
4587000	4588000	We could use a new theme song too, Bobby.
4589000	4597000	Let's travel around the world and take a look at some release dates and things coming to a store near you.
4597000	4607000	This week is quite exciting. Like I mentioned before, I was trying to get it, but I gotta wait until it comes out like everybody else.
4608000	4609000	Whatever.
4610000	4615000	So DJ Hero 2 is coming out this week. That's going to be on all three major systems.
4616000	4619000	I guess I'll have to wait until the 3DS version comes out for the portable DJ Hero.
4620000	4621000	So that's kinda cool.
4621000	4628000	And then of course they're going to be re-releasing the first DJ Hero game in case you want to buy the standalone thing.
4629000	4635000	And then they have the bundles with the controllers. The bundles with two controllers and a microphone because you need two turntables and a microphone.
4636000	4639000	So that's all fun stuff.
4640000	4642000	Other slightly more boring stuff.
4643000	4646000	Solitaire Overload Plus I had delayed from last week. Still hasn't come out. Still don't care.
4646000	4650000	Kirby's Epic Yarn that came out today, so that's pretty exciting.
4654000	4659000	Farmtopia on the DS. It's a farm sim. Awesome.
4660000	4661000	G.
4662000	4669000	My First Dollhouse. Not picking that one up, but that's on the DS as well.
4670000	4672000	I Love Puppies. That's also on DS.
4672000	4676000	Other fun things coming out.
4677000	4685000	Zuzu Pets. Kung Zu also held over from I think last week. That's on DS.
4686000	4690000	And also those new Tron controllers that glow. Those are coming out this week.
4691000	4693000	Need one to have to have.
4694000	4695000	I totally want that keyboard and mouse set.
4695000	4702000	Can I just say a tangent because I want to do that whole like, I got something special. I got tickets to that Tron Knight thing.
4703000	4712000	And I just realized yesterday, same day as my friend's birthday, that if I don't go to whatever birthday shenanigans she plans, I will be murdered.
4713000	4716000	So yeah. I don't know if I'm going to be able to go now. Sad panda.
4717000	4721000	And no, taking her to Tron Knight is not an option because that's not something she'd want to do.
4722000	4723000	Sorry Loki.
4723000	4730000	Another holdover from last week. Lead Shred featuring the Jamaican bobsled team on the Wii.
4731000	4732000	What?
4733000	4735000	Wait, wait, wait. I remember you mentioning that last week and I made fun of it.
4736000	4737000	That's why I said it was a holdover from last week.
4738000	4739000	Oh, sorry.
4740000	4741000	As was the Wii inflatable racing cart.
4742000	4743000	Yeah, Rob, pay attention.
4744000	4745000	Sorry, I was reading our chat room and looking at Bobby's pictures.
4746000	4749000	I want the inflatable racing cart. We should put Shermy in it.
4749000	4756000	And the best part about that Wii inflatable racing cart, much like the inflatable raft, I'm sure that could be used in the pool as well.
4759000	4765000	Naruto, ship it in. Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4766000	4770000	EA Sports MMA on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.
4771000	4777000	A little known game called Fallout New Vegas coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4777000	4778000	Oh, I've heard of that game.
4779000	4780000	Yes, I hear it's popular.
4781000	4787000	Yes, I hear Fallout is a little cult franchise. I hear it's a very artsy game.
4788000	4793000	Arcanium Gothic 4 on Xbox 360 out this week.
4794000	4797000	Imagine Resort Owner. Imagine I Don't Care. That's on DS.
4798000	4800000	Enhance for the DSi, by the way.
4800000	4810000	Active Life Explorer. That's Namco's fitness kids game. That's on the Wii.
4811000	4816000	Kevin Van Dam Fishing on PlayStation 3. Not as exciting as Jean-Claude Van Dam Fishing.
4819000	4820000	And that joke was fail.
4821000	4824000	Blazing Souls Accolade on PSP this week.
4824000	4828000	Sesame Street. Elmo's Eat-A-Zoo Adventure.

4831000	4832000	No, I said Sesame Street.
4833000	4838000	I want to go to Sesame Street. Listen, bird!
4841000	4847000	You know, I had these DVDs I brought home for Nelly. It was Sesame Shalom.
4848000	4849000	I want to see that.
4850000	4851000	Jewish Sesame Street.
4851000	4854000	Yeah, I've seen pictures of them. I've went in to see those.
4855000	4859000	Yeah. She's like, this is stupid. I'm like, okay.

4867000	4871000	Saw II Flesh and Blood on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.

4876000	4880000	Bakugan Defenders of the Core on the Wii.
4881000	4887000	And PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, and DS and PSP I believe.
4888000	4890000	Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 11 on...
4892000	4893000	Lots of stuff this week.
4894000	4899000	DS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and then of course they're going to have bundles for all that stuff.
4899000	4905000	They're actually making a wireless shotgun for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 which is kind of neat, I suppose.
4908000	4912000	What other fun stuff? Brunswick Cosmic Bowling with a bowling ball.
4913000	4915000	That's right. I mentioned that last week and that's still a bad idea.
4916000	4920000	Rock of the Dead on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
4921000	4924000	Might be just the 360 version because I thought PlayStation 3 got delayed.
4924000	4928000	Seems to be a big week. Is the holiday season like, are we here now?
4929000	4930000	Oh yeah, we're here.
4931000	4932000	Oh wow, it seems like we're here early this year.
4933000	4936000	I guess it is October, it's like mid-October. Where have I been?
4937000	4938000	This is like the third week of October.

4982000	4988000	Apparently Thrustmaster has a really expensive steering wheel that you can get for $250.

4992000	4993000	Thrustmaster.
4994000	4995000	Scuderia edition.
4996000	4997000	Thrust it, thrust it!
4998000	5000000	Thank you, that's what I was getting at.
5000000	5004000	Were you listening last night? Cause I brought that exact same thing up.
5005000	5009000	I was like oh my god the bopagon, there's only so many times you can say pull it and whack it.
5010000	5012000	Before somebody's going to wonder why this is a G show.
5013000	5019000	No I admit I was at the wedding reception and I probably wouldn't have even gotten signal to run the all games app on my phone to listen.
5020000	5022000	I had a good conversation about that last night on the show.
5022000	5029000	Well if you ever update your podcast feed, DG Morpheus, just saying.
5030000	5033000	Vanquish, the new game from Platinum Games is out this week.
5034000	5037000	That's right, this is the one that came from the creator of the Resident Evil series.
5038000	5040000	That's on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.

5058000	5061000	What other fun stuff do we have coming out this week?
5062000	5066000	Eve Online commissioned Officer Edition for PC.
5067000	5071000	Cars Toon Mater's Tall Tales on the Wii.
5071000	5076000	Cars Toon Mater's Tall Tales on the Wii.
5077000	5083000	She's laughing because I got told to shut my whore mouth by a lovely host of another radio show in our chat room.
5084000	5086000	Who's not Bobby?
5087000	5091000	Hidden Mysteries Salem Witch Trials on the Nintendo DS.
5094000	5096000	Lots of junk.
5096000	5100000	Is that your professional assessment as a video game analyst?
5101000	5102000	Crap crap and more crap.
5103000	5105000	Super analyst, okay.
5106000	5108000	Is Toon making me think of Madeline Kahn?
5109000	5111000	No no no no no yes.
5112000	5113000	Can I go to Japanese releases?
5114000	5115000	No you can't, we're not done yet.
5116000	5118000	Bring a book to the show.
5119000	5122000	I'm going to girlcat your list, Loki, so we can move on to Rob.
5123000	5124000	No, we're almost done.
5124000	5125000	Hurry up.
5126000	5127000	Shaun White's Skateboarding.
5128000	5130000	That's the last thing coming out, it's a week from today.
5131000	5134000	And that is on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
5135000	5136000	I am done.
5137000	5138000	I love Bobby. Bobby's so great.
5139000	5140000	Do you now?
5141000	5142000	Thank you for that clarification.
5143000	5144000	I was like, wait, did I say that?
5145000	5147000	Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates.
5148000	5150000	Xbox 360 in Japan!
5150000	5156000	We have FIFA Soccer 11, Medal of Honor, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2,
5157000	5162000	R.U.S.E. or Roos, and Vanquish all come out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
5163000	5164000	That's on the 21st.
5165000	5166000	R.U.S.
5167000	5168000	Rats of Unusual Size.
5169000	5173000	On the Playstation 3 we have Big 3 Gun Shooting,
5174000	5177000	which I'm sure is the same as one of those games that Loki just named with the gun gone.
5177000	5179000	Beat Sketch comes out this week.
5180000	5182000	As well as FIFA Soccer 11, Kung Fu Rider,
5183000	5185000	Me and My Pet, which I think is the what?
5186000	5187000	Connectimal?
5187000	5188000	That's an eye pet.
5188000	5189000	Not on the SOTY system.
5190000	5192000	Medal of Honor, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2,
5193000	5198000	and the Playstation Eye and the Move and the Resident Evil 5 pack are all this week in Japan.
5199000	5201000	It'd be better if it was Me and My Penthouse Pet.
5201000	5206000	R.U.S.E., Sports Champion, and Vanquish all also on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan.
5207000	5209000	So I guess we're getting into a very busy week in Japan as well.
5210000	5212000	Just so you know, is this game in the U.S. Beat Sketch?
5213000	5214000	I don't know this one.
5215000	5218000	No, I thought that was coming out only on the Playstation Network here.
5219000	5221000	Interesting, because they are releasing it as a title on the Playstation 3.
5222000	5226000	It is a move game where it looks like you kind of draw and little patterns sort of come out.
5227000	5229000	You sketch the different Playstation shapes or whatever,
5229000	5231000	and I'm assuming it kind of makes music.
5232000	5234000	And you can see this lovely little girl here drawing flowers,
5235000	5237000	and I'm assuming it's music because you see a little counter in the corner.
5238000	5239000	So it looks like it might be kind of neat.
5240000	5243000	That looks kind of fun. Could you imagine though playing like Oendan with something like that?
5244000	5246000	If they ever brought Oendan out on the Wii.
5247000	5249000	Is there a music game you'd like to see on Playstation Move?
5250000	5251000	I want Space Channel 5, I'm not even going to lie.
5252000	5253000	That would be fantastic.
5254000	5255000	I was trying to think whether...
5255000	5258000	It has to have a special controller that looks like Ulala's mic.
5259000	5264000	Here's a preview here real quick in the studio for this beat sketch,
5265000	5266000	and I'll post this YouTube to our chat room as well.
5272000	5275000	It looks like Mario Paint but happier or something, I don't know.
5275000	5277000	I don't know.
5283000	5285000	I see that people are drawing on the screen.
5288000	5290000	Some really intricate artwork though.
5296000	5297000	Interesting. It's cute.
5298000	5299000	Yeah, it looks like it could be neat.
5300000	5302000	It's a clever little commercial, it doesn't really say much about the game.
5302000	5307000	If you want to see that YouTube we were just playing, FamitsuTube is the link there.
5308000	5310000	I'm assuming that must be part of Famitsu Magazine. There you go.
5311000	5315000	I was going to say there is the new Dance Dance Revolution game that will be coming out
5316000	5321000	that actually utilizes the Playstation Move to do all sorts of weird Para type stuff.
5322000	5323000	This week here in the US or is that soon?
5324000	5326000	No, it's next month. About a month from now.
5327000	5328000	You know what, I could just hook up the Pink Biscuits.
5328000	5332000	Going to the Japanese release dates on the Nintendo Wii.
5333000	5336000	Minna de Buchen Family Trainer comes out this week in Japan.
5337000	5344000	I don't know what this game is. It's a sports game of some sort but it looks like cute little Indiana Jonesy family characters.
5345000	5348000	In fact, even on the cover they have a family dressed up as Indiana Jones.
5349000	5353000	It looks like a newer version of the power pad that two people use at once is what it looks like.
5353000	5360000	Imagine you have an up, down, and no arrow facing towards the other player but one facing away.
5361000	5362000	It's like three arrows in the center.
5363000	5364000	Yes, that's the active life game that came out over here.
5365000	5366000	Oh, okay. So it is. Interesting.
5367000	5369000	Well, it's definitely regionalized for Japan now. It's coming out over there.
5370000	5372000	Yes, because it doesn't have kids on the front. It has cutesy anime stuff on the front.
5373000	5376000	Yes. No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle comes out this week in Japan.
5377000	5379000	And the Super Mario Collection Special Pack which we've talked about earlier on the show.
5379000	5382000	The whole, if you want to pay a lot of money for an old Super Nintendo ROM.
5383000	5386000	Super Mario All Stars game that they could have brought to the Virtual Console because they don't release anything on Virtual Console anymore.
5387000	5388000	Are you done?
5389000	5396000	On the Nintendo DS, Strike Witches 2 Yasunaso Puni Puni Suru comes out this week on the Nintendo DS.
5397000	5398000	What game is that? I don't know.
5399000	5400000	It's a shooter.
5400000	5411000	It's a shooter too. Dang, these characters are huge. It looks like Contra with chicks wearing bunny ears in school uniforms with skirts that are way too short.
5412000	5414000	And there's kind of a sensual massage between two chicks going on right there.
5415000	5416000	There's no such thing as skirts that are way too short.
5417000	5419000	Just saying.
5422000	5423000	Lastly on the PS...
5424000	5425000	Can I do mine? Can I do mine? Can I do mine?
5425000	5430000	Just pee real quick, I promise. FIFA Soccer 11 Beyblade Portable Slaughter Mania P. Okay, now you can do yours.
5431000	5435000	Okay. Mine are very, very British.
5436000	5437000	Okay, not really.
5438000	5443000	Releases for the UK. We have today. Well, it's already today. It's the future there. I forgot.
5444000	5451000	The 17th, The Political Machine on PC. On the 20th is Costume Quest Super Meat Boy.
5451000	5461000	On the 21st we have Professor Layton and the Unwound Future. On the 22nd, EA Sports MMA and Fallout New Vegas, which is gonna be hot.
5462000	5467000	We also have Monopoly Streets and NBA Jam and Vanquish and Vanquish.
5468000	5471000	And no more Vanquish.
5472000	5473000	And no more mic cord.
5474000	5475000	Did it cut out again?
5476000	5477000	Yeah, we have dead air right now.
5478000	5479000	You alright?
5479000	5480000	Do we have dead air now?
5481000	5481000	No, you're good.
5482000	5483000	Okay, do you want me to read my list again?
5484000	5487000	No, no, we just didn't get the Vanquish, Vanquish and More Vanquish part that you said.
5488000	5494000	Okay, on the 22nd is Vanquish. And also on the 22nd, Vanquish. And no more Vanquish.
5495000	5496000	Promise me we'll get a mic cord before next week.
5497000	5501000	Death Spank's coming out the week after. And that just has the best name ever, Death Spank.
5501000	5509000	Bobby in our chat room again has a really good comment. Beat Sketches is close to Owen Don as she'll actually be able to get, he says.
5510000	5511000	Sad face. Owen Don is awesome.
5512000	5521000	I don't know about that. Because I think that the new Dance Dance Revolution game has some fruity little mode in it that's, you know, with the stupid move controllers.
5521000	5531000	I'm sorry, I can't take Konami seriously anymore with their dancing games. I mean, just with Dance Master, you're gonna really look at, you can learn how to dance with this game.
5532000	5535000	No, you're gonna look like a fool if you try to do what they do in that game in real life.
5536000	5538000	But Para Para was awesome because you looked like a fool, am I right?
5539000	5540000	Don't get me wrong, okay?
5541000	5542000	Jessica, didn't you love the Para Para?
5543000	5548000	Not totally. There was a couple that I knew how to do that I liked, but other than that, I'm like, I'm gonna goth dance this shit!
5548000	5553000	I loved it when you goth danced on the Para Para machine because it was like this walking irony.
5554000	5558000	I'm gonna goth dance to super happy music!
5559000	5567000	Don't get me wrong, I mean, I probably have the game pre-ordered just to check it out, but, I mean, come on. I'm not taking it seriously.
5568000	5576000	I'm not going, hey, this is an awesome new dance franchise from Konami. I just see this as, oh my god, this pile of shit is gonna be stinking up my room.
5576000	5581000	But I'm gonna check it out for the sake of the show. Taking one for the team, if you will.
5582000	5587000	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news. The classic game of the week is just up ahead.
5588000	5595000	Yes, with Halloween right around the corner, apparently Sony is allowing you to download some free movies.
5596000	5600000	You can check out some free midnight movie rentals on your Playstation 3.
5600000	5607000	They are available for a very select period of time. In fact, this weekend they had Bram Stoker's Dracula.
5608000	5612000	That was available from 5pm on the 16th to 3am on the 17th.
5613000	5620000	Next week they're gonna have Savage County, same time frame, 5pm on October 23rd to 3am on October 24th.
5621000	5625000	And also, of course, Nightmare on Elm Street, the original one.
5625000	5634000	That's gonna be available on actually Halloween from 5pm on October 30th to 3am on October 31st.
5635000	5640000	I think that's kinda cool. They should really do that just with random movies all throughout the year. Not necessarily horror movies.
5641000	5642000	Maybe it's a trial thing.
5643000	5652000	I think it's a good idea to get people excited about that. And also for people that maybe have downloaded a lot of movies from their service and then got ripped off and their movies went bye-bye and they had to fight them tooth and nail.
5652000	5654000	The phone calls we've had on the show before.
5655000	5664000	What about, are these movies hosted by Elvira? Because I'm sorry, it's not a true Halloween midnight movie spectacular without Elvira hosting.
5665000	5669000	Dude, that would be awesome. They should have some sort of hosted stuff.
5670000	5676000	Sadly I could actually tell you. She's in a new movie called All About Evil, but she's actually Cassandra Peterson.
5676000	5682000	Her normal self is in this movie All About Evil that's directed by Peaches Christ, who is a drag queen in San Francisco.
5683000	5686000	It's like a... Alan and I kinda wanna go see it.
5687000	5692000	That's kinda something cool. They should do that though for like, say, instead of this...
5693000	5694000	What was it?
5695000	5698000	Here, download a movie for free. Put a little work into it to make it awesome.
5698000	5705000	Not necessarily that, but actually have it where you can watch a movie with friends and stuff. But do it like 1 vs 100.
5706000	5709000	Have a theater full of people, have it hosted by Elvira or something like that.
5710000	5711000	Mystery Science Theater type of thing.
5712000	5714000	The last Elvira experience I had was playing Pimple.
5715000	5718000	But then you can even chat to friends and stuff like that.
5718000	5728000	Or here is a novel concept, Sony. I'm gonna give you some consulting advice for free.
5729000	5733000	Here is how to make people interested in shit they were never interested in before on Sony.
5734000	5743000	Do it all in Sony Home. Play the movie in the theater on Sony Home and everybody could actually be in the theater.
5743000	5749000	And you could have a live host up on the stage being a dork and doing the whole riff tracks thing.
5750000	5752000	And it's something new and kind of cool.
5753000	5757000	And then pay Orange Lounge $5,000 for the idea.
5758000	5759000	I gave that to Sony for free.
5760000	5762000	But we want the money anyway.
5764000	5767000	You can put me and Sony Home for that free advice. There you go.
5768000	5771000	But seriously, I'm surprised that they haven't done something like that Rocky Horror Picture Show with you.
5771000	5772000	Rob can have no neck.
5773000	5776000	Frisbee in the chat room says throw virtual popcorn at the screen.
5777000	5778000	Amazing idea. Your avatars could...
5779000	5780000	With the move.
5783000	5785000	I'm just trying to picture the time warp.
5786000	5794000	I could just see some total asshats though that would just sit there the whole time flailing around on their move and just popcorns flying everywhere.
5795000	5796000	The entire movie.
5796000	5800000	That's fine. But like you get points for hitting your props at the right cue?
5801000	5804000	Like you press A for, you know, squirt gun?
5805000	5809000	Let's see. Going to some comments from the chat room. Tigerclaw was saying Elvira needs her own video game.
5810000	5812000	And he actually did follow up saying, you know what, there really was an Elvira game.
5813000	5817000	I don't know if it's the same one he linked. I'm not even going to look because I do remember an older PC game.
5818000	5820000	And I think there was even one on like the Commodore 64. Like really that old.
5821000	5823000	But there was an Elvira video game that was kind of like an adventure game.
5823000	5829000	And it actually had like, there was like gore in it and stuff. It was very kind of like, from what I remember it was a very kind of core-ish game.
5830000	5831000	I think this is it.
5832000	5834000	Telltale Games. We have a new franchise for you.
5835000	5837000	Actually that's very cool. I like that idea.
5838000	5839000	Alright. Let's see.
5840000	5842000	There were I think three Elvira pinball tables.
5843000	5844000	Mike. Mike again.
5845000	5847000	There were three, I believe, Elvira pinball tables.
5847000	5854000	Defective Candy in our chat room says, that virtual popcorn idea they use in Gaia online and they are total asshats at it.
5855000	5856000	And yes, I used to play Gaia.
5857000	5859000	I still have my Gaia account in that picture.
5860000	5867000	Okay. I used to play Gaia. My account is still active. And yes, you can go buy stuff from the little vendor to throw at the screen.
5868000	5869000	Good times.
5870000	5873000	Sj100 Matt says, Rob, would you host a Rocky Horror Night in home or in the OLR house?
5874000	5875000	Absolutely.
5875000	5882000	Sony, call me or whatever. It'll be fun. Why not? I will whore myself out for the sake of publicizing this show.
5883000	5884000	And the All Games Network, of course.
5885000	5888000	I would even do it for free the first time.
5890000	5893000	You get a freebie the first time. The rest of the time you have to pay for his whore mouth.
5894000	5895000	That's right.
5895000	5904000	Ah, yeah. Okay. Anyhow, it's a cool idea that hopefully will get cooler.
5905000	5907000	Anyhow, let's talk about something that...
5908000	5909000	Okay, your boyfriend gets kudos from me.
5910000	5911000	Why? What'd he do?
5912000	5913000	For saying that scared stiff was the best of the Elvira table.
5914000	5915000	Oh, he loves the Elvira pinball game.
5916000	5917000	Ah, so great.
5918000	5919000	There's several of them.
5920000	5921000	There's three.
5921000	5924000	There's a two layer play field that was really cool.
5925000	5928000	Good times. You know what pinball FX2 needs? Elvira table.
5929000	5930000	Elvira.
5931000	5933000	But the only problem with Elvira is she's getting kind of old.
5934000	5935000	Elvira.
5936000	5937000	That Elvira's probably dead.
5937000	5950000	I like how we're all laughing at this and poor Loki's looking at us like, you people are weird.
5951000	5956000	But seeing you know with the magic of technology now we can have you know old Elvira and new Elvira.
5957000	5962000	Well I don't know if you know but they actually did a reality show on sci-fi network that was the next Elvira.
5962000	5968000	Where they were trying to cast the next Elvira and you know some girl won but they didn't do anything with it.
5969000	5970000	There's still old Elvira.
5971000	5972000	Sorry you lose. There is no replacement for Elvira.
5973000	5974000	Exactly.
5975000	5977000	As long as there's plastic surgery and makeup we'll always have our Elvira.
5978000	5979000	That's right.
5979000	5996000	Okay let me move on here to Blizzard and some stuff going on at Blizzard and Starcraft 2. This isn't about WoW although I will say the Cataclysm cinematic is now online and it had its little preview during the NFL game tonight and the full one is online and it is epic epicness.
5996000	6014000	If you are a WoW player you get to see the Thousand Needles being flooded. You get to see Deathwing landing on Stormwind and putting his claws into the castle and you get to see Ashenvale and any alliance player will love this because you get to see Ashenvale get just destroyed.
6015000	6018000	I'm sorry not Ashenvale, Aberdeen. You can see Aberdeen get destroyed. I'm a bad WoW player sorry.
6019000	6020000	Aberdeen just gets destroyed in the trailer it's great.
6021000	6022000	Isn't that where they keep cows?
6022000	6026000	Aberdeen. Why do you always have to beat up the cows?
6027000	6028000	No I wasn't beating up the cows this time.
6029000	6030000	To be fair there are no cows in Aberdeen she's crazy.
6031000	6033000	No that's where the Angus cows come from.
6034000	6037000	Not in the game. All the cows are in us elven forest.
6038000	6039000	Is this spelled like actual Aberdeen?
6040000	6045000	Forest cows that's ridiculous. It's a video game people.
6046000	6048000	You just kept making me think of Scotland.
6048000	6051000	Let me move on to Starcraft 2 news because that's what this is really about.
6052000	6056000	It's about Starcraft 2. Blizzard is actually going to be suing the cheat makers.
6057000	6061000	Five thousand people were busted previously by Blizzard for cheating in Starcraft 2.
6062000	6066000	Well Blizzard is actually going to take the people who made the cheats to court.
6067000	6069000	They are taking three men to court for making those hacks.
6069000	6085000	Just days after the release of Starcraft 2 defendants already had developed, marketed, and distributed to the public a variety of hacks and cheats designed to modify and in fact destroy the Starcraft 2 online gaming experience says this lawsuit.
6086000	6094000	In fact on the very day that Starcraft 2 was released representatives of the hack's website advised members of the public that our staff is already planning on new releases for the game.
6094000	6099000	The accused are being accused of multiple counts of copyright infringement.
6100000	6105000	Blizzard wants damages and a cut of the money that the three received from selling the hacks.
6106000	6107000	That was your problem.
6108000	6111000	Two of these people are from Canada. One of them is from Peru.
6112000	6113000	Blame Peru.
6114000	6115000	It doesn't have the same ring to it.
6116000	6117000	It doesn't have the same ring to it. I'm sorry to say that.
6118000	6119000	So we'll see what happens with this.
6119000	6124000	Probably be a settlement and these guys will get sued to oblivion. We'll see. Although the international part of it makes it very interesting.
6125000	6132000	Blizzard is also warning people who want to cheat with Starcraft, use these trainers at your own risk.
6133000	6138000	This is because Blizzard has suspended some accounts because some folks have been exploiting.
6139000	6146000	And there was a guy on this website Cheat Happens that was reporting that they were banned from using a trainer in single player.
6146000	6151000	See, I have a problem with that. Because if you want to cheat in a single player game, who are you hurting?
6152000	6155000	Well here's the thing. Blizzard did want to clarify on what's going on here.
6156000	6161000	Blizzard Entertainment is not banning Starcraft 2 players just for using single player cheats.
6162000	6167000	There's been some confusion in the last couple days about the suspensions and bans meted out to players caught cheating in Starcraft 2.
6167000	6175000	It's important to point out first that many of the third party hacks and cheats developed for Starcraft 2 contain both single and multiplayer functionality.
6176000	6184000	In order to protect the integrity of multiplayer competition, we are actively detecting cheat programs used in multiplayer modes whether they are human opponents or not.
6185000	6190000	That said, players who opt to use any type of third party hacks do so at their own risk.
6191000	6194000	There are built in cheat codes for Starcraft 2 single player that can be used safely.
6194000	6200000	Blizzard has always taken cheating seriously and will continue to aggressively crack down on players who cheat in our games.
6201000	6206000	Keep in mind, Blizzard also has an achievement system that even works in single player and I imagine these cheat codes disable those.
6207000	6218000	They probably don't like the idea of these other exploits making the achievements easier to get because it gives the wrong perception as to what kind of skills someone has on Starcraft.
6219000	6220000	So something to keep in mind.
6220000	6223000	So after hearing that, does that change your mind?
6224000	6229000	Loki, that Blizzard doesn't really want to ban the single player cheaters, it's just the fact that most of them are multiplayer as well?
6230000	6231000	They'll find ways around it.
6233000	6235000	They always do one way or another, don't they?
6236000	6246000	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to another time when folks weren't banned en masse by cheating on video games and talk about the classic video game of the week.
6246000	6254000	Dark soccer is going to take a stroll to the vault and pull out an old dusty moldy video game that she says,
6255000	6260000	Hey, you brats, you need to respect this video game or die.
6261000	6263000	So dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
6264000	6271000	The game of the week is Ikari Warriors, which was also known as Ikari in Japan, which means furious.
6271000	6282000	This is very, very cool. It used rotary joysticks and had a two player mode and it has Ralph and Clark that later showed up in the King of Fighters series.
6283000	6286000	Which we know Ralph and Clark, don't we?
6288000	6292000	They also make an appearance in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7.
6293000	6299000	At any rate, you are Ralph and Clark, these commando dudes, and they're trying to reach the village of Ikari.
6299000	6308000	And basically you get attacked with tanks and soldiers and helicopters, but you get power ups on the way.
6309000	6313000	Because power ups really do show up in real life when you're trying to charge the village of furious.
6314000	6320000	At any rate, this was one of the first major games, like I said, to use a rotary joystick.
6321000	6326000	Which, like I said, you can rotate as well as push in different directions.
6326000	6333000	And your buttons, one of them was your gun and the other one was for throwing grenades so you could blow them up.
6334000	6340000	And it also was fully cooperative, one of the early games to do that, and had vehicles in it.
6341000	6348000	So, they actually did an SNK pinout and they did a JAMA pinout.
6348000	6360000	So, for people with the arcade SNK machines, it worked in those.
6361000	6373000	And it was really cool. It had different things in it that they had to edit out for the US version.
6373000	6384000	The guy that you rescue in the Japanese version is General Kawasaki, who was named after SNK's former president Eikichi Kawasaki.
6385000	6390000	And it was Colonel Cook in the US ones after Tradewest, founder Leland Cook.
6391000	6395000	And the enemies in the game, though, were supposed to be Neo-Nazis.
6396000	6397000	So, they suck.
6397000	6404000	There was a DOS version that came out, and there were sequels.
6405000	6410000	There was Victory Road, also in 1986, and Ikari 3 The Rescue.
6411000	6424000	And then there was also a Guerrilla War arcade called Guevara in Japan that used a similar type of gameplay that featured Che Guevara and Fidel Castro as the main guys.
6424000	6436000	As for the other versions that came out, there was the NES version, Apple II, DOS, Atari ST, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Armstrad CPC.
6437000	6439000	The NES version was so glitched out.
6440000	6440000	I agree.
6441000	6442000	But ABBA was a code.
6443000	6443000	Yes.
6444000	6445000	That made the game awesome.
6446000	6451000	There was an MSX version of it and different 16-bit versions that came out.
6451000	6454000	There's actually two different Commodore 64 version R.O.B.s.
6455000	6456000	I was saying two R.O.B.s.
6457000	6460000	One was put out by Data East and the other one was by Elite.
6461000	6463000	Interesting, because I don't really remember one of them. I had one of them.
6464000	6465000	I remember this game.
6466000	6472000	Yeah, the Atari ST and Amiga versions were supposed to have better graphics and sound effects.
6473000	6476000	And the NES version was developed by Micronix.
6476000	6480000	And the problem with the NES one is it was flashy, flashy, flash, flash, flash.
6481000	6482000	Glitch-tastic.
6483000	6484000	But it's a cool game.
6485000	6491000	We had some problems with our characters being stuck in different layers of sprites, so it was actually running under the map or something like that.
6492000	6495000	Then we kept getting the game dirtier and dirtier just to see what glitches we could get.
6496000	6498000	I love the NES.
6499000	6500000	That's it.
6501000	6502000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6503000	6504000	And I'll tell you how I picked it.
6504000	6508000	I went in the vault, grabbed one of the bins, and put my finger on a game.
6509000	6510000	That's how I picked it.
6511000	6512000	That's how you picked it. That's how she does it, folks.
6513000	6517000	But I approve because, again, any game that uses ABBA as a code is awesome.
6518000	6519000	Are they dancing queens?
6520000	6522000	I cannot imagine Ralph and Clark doing disco dancing.
6523000	6526000	Contrary to what Spaznator is saying in chat, ABBA will not play an 8-bit version of Dancing Queen.
6527000	6529000	Although, I think that should be in a future game.
6530000	6531000	What do I know, though?
6531000	6535000	Alright, so that's going to wrap up this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
6536000	6537000	There is plenty more to come in Part B.
6538000	6541000	We've got more news, lots and lots of good stuff, Twitter topics.
6542000	6544000	And tonight, I'm so excited because Jessica's here.
6545000	6546000	We thought we'd do something special.
6547000	6549000	We're going to do List List tonight with Jessica.
6550000	6551000	And the topic tonight, you ready for this?
6552000	6554000	Because Jessica's got to think about this because I'm springing this on her during break.
6555000	6556000	Here we go.
6556000	6562000	The topic tonight, the thing I learned most from DDR Freak, is tonight's List List topic.
6563000	6566000	The thing I learned most from DDR Freak.
6567000	6569000	It's going to be a fun night, ladies and gentlemen.
6570000	6573000	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6579000	6582000	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6582000	6588000	We are live on October the 17th of 2010 with the 386th episode of our show.
6589000	6591000	We're a super fast computer, if this is 1982.
6592000	6594000	Or 1992, excuse me, a 386, there you go.
6595000	6596000	I had a 38620.
6597000	6600000	My first PC was a 386SX16.
6601000	6605000	And that's running in turbo mode, otherwise it's a 38616.
6607000	6610000	With, get this, a 30 megabyte hard drive.
6610000	6611000	Oh my god.
6612000	6614000	And one megabyte of RAM.
6615000	6616000	Holy shit.
6617000	6619000	Running Windows 3.1.
6620000	6622000	Actually I think it was 3.0 at that time.
6623000	6625000	My friend's dad is an engineer back in the 40s.
6626000	6632000	And he was talking about one time we were visiting and he was saying that they lined the room in magnets to make 1K of memory.
6633000	6634000	Wow.
6635000	6636000	Think about that.
6636000	6641000	And now what are we running? We got, just, you can go spend, you know, 90 bucks and get a terabyte hard drive.
6642000	6643000	No problem.
6644000	6645000	For and for all.
6646000	6651000	If you're just joining us after this break, the other voice you hear there is our lovely guest tonight, Jessica Harper from Understation Live.
6652000	6655000	But we remember her as Iguana Girl from DDR Freak.
6656000	6657000	I'm sorry, Iguana Girl.
6658000	6659000	Iguana Girl.
6659000	6667000	Iguana Girl. So there you go. And she's here tonight because she's helping us reminisce about the good old days of DDR and all that.
6668000	6675000	And you know, kind of where are they now? And we definitely found out some interesting stuff in part A about the behind the scenes operations of DDR Freak.
6676000	6678000	Now I know what types of questions not to ask moving forward.
6679000	6686000	But I don't know how much you can kind of say about this, but I know you eventually stepped down as an administrator of DDR Freak, as most people do.
6686000	6689000	You know, these things kind of come in cycles. There's only so much time you can give up.
6690000	6696000	But what do you kind of think about where like DDR Freak is at now? Do you think it's kind of like past its prime, it's old and dead and gone?
6697000	6707000	Dead. Yeah, there's still a few people that are straggling in there, but even Random Chat, which is the absolute most frequented forum, it will go a full day without any kind of hits at all at this point.
6708000	6713000	I tried looking back like six months ago and was completely depressed.
6713000	6721000	Yeah, there's the occasional where are they now type of thread, but pretty much what's going on at this point is just eh.
6722000	6725000	What happened? It used to be the place to be.
6726000	6732000	I think that most of it is just the mainstream nature of DDR has kind of killed it a bit.
6733000	6738000	And a lot of the old school people don't necessarily like the new class, so to speak.
6738000	6748000	And I think that, you know, just overall the site started getting slower and slower, started having issues and people just weren't as interested anymore.
6749000	6755000	Sadly, you're probably right. And I think probably Konami's lack of support for DDR for a very long time probably contributed to that.
6756000	6758000	Yeah, definitely. So that's a bummer.
6759000	6763000	Are there any other forums that you surf these days that we can find you on?
6763000	6769000	Not particularly. Most of what I do is just, you know, I sit and play on Facebook most of the time.
6770000	6771000	Good times.
6772000	6779000	Yeah, I already have a group of friends. I'm not really necessarily looking to go search out a whole new group of friends or anything, so I just kind of do my own thing.
6780000	6784000	But you can at least be found Saturday nights at Under Station Live right here at All Games Radio.
6785000	6789000	Yes, and I do also have a Facebook that is my public Facebook for Under Station Live.
6789000	6792000	You can find me under Jessica Harper on Facebook if you want to add me.
6793000	6800000	And I'll sometimes post, you know, interesting pictures and what have you through that. So, yeah, kind of a, you know, an online version of me.
6801000	6805000	Alright. Check that out. Sounds good. Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick news.
6806000	6811000	I do want to say though first, since, you know, Jessica's our guest this week, we already have a guest lined up for next week as well.
6812000	6817000	It's like suddenly we're like the month of guests. I like this because it's another in-studio guest, which is very exciting.
6817000	6823000	Segg is going to be here next week. Oops. Apparently Segg has theme music. Sorry about that.
6824000	6828000	Fail on my part. The music bag, er, the mailbag music aired a little early.
6829000	6836000	Segg is going to be here next week and he's going to talk all about Umlaud, which is his big, and if you've been listening to the show for a while, you probably heard him on the show last year.
6837000	6843000	But this time he's going to come in-studio so he can actually talk to us throughout the night and definitely pimp Umlaud, which is going on, well it's not going on right now,
6843000	6850000	but the pre-antics are going on right now on the website. Umlaud.org. It's a fundraiser, of course, for Child's Play.
6851000	6857000	It's going to happen in San Francisco in December. All the details are there at Umlaud.org. You don't even have to know how to type the Umlaud.
6858000	6859000	When is it, Ian?
6860000	6861000	It is December...
6862000	6863000	They're going to be running Rock Band 3 this time?
6864000	6868000	Yeah, I believe so. We're going to get all the details from Segg next week, so I don't want to spoil everything, but I believe it's December 9th?
6868000	6877000	It's a Thursday. I remember that because it got bumped up because last year it was on like a Monday and now it's a bigger deal this year, so it's actually on a Thursday.
6878000	6881000	So we've got to ask about that. Ooh, I got the date right. It is December 9th, 2010.
6882000	6885000	And yes, I do believe Rock Band 3 is a part of it as well. We're going to get all the details.
6886000	6892000	There's going to be some big, big, big band package deals that weren't around last year. We're going to talk about that as well.
6892000	6903000	If you're not in the San Francisco Bay Area and you don't feel like driving or flying out here for it, you still can donate online. Umlaud.org. U-M-L-O-U-D dot O-R-G for all the details.
6904000	6908000	He will be here next week again to give us all the nitty-gritty about it.
6909000	6918000	And Segg also happens to work for one of the big developers that we like here at All Games Radio, and we're going to talk to him about that as much as we can.
6918000	6921000	I mean, you know, there's these old NDAs and things.
6922000	6924000	And pitch him our idea for the Elvira adventure game.
6925000	6934000	He's listening right now, so he might have heard it. But yes, we'll try to pitch him our ideas, and at least the games that are out, we can hopefully ask some good questions on and all that stuff. So that'll be good.
6935000	6939000	So we're going to talk to him about all that fun stuff next week. It's something to look forward to.
6939000	6948000	I like this whole, like, having guests every week thing. You know, we had Tiara a couple weeks ago, and now we have Guana Girl, Jessica Harper's here tonight, and then we've got Segg next week.
6949000	6956000	This is great. We've got to get some more game developers in here, too. I don't know if we can get them to travel all the way out the sack, but we know the Skype thing works okay.
6957000	6958000	Alright, anyhow.
6958000	6959000	They can sleep on my couch.
6960000	6962000	That's right. Come pimp your game and sleep on the couch.
6963000	6965000	Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick, quick, quick news.
6965000	6974000	By the way, if you haven't gotten your Twitter topics in, now is a great time, and I would really encourage, since we do have Jessica here in studio, and we are talking a lot about the old-school days,
6975000	6979000	definitely if you have Twitter questions about the old-school days, we'd love to hear it, although we will happily take any topic.
6980000	6987000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Get those tweets in right now. You've got about five minutes, five to ten minutes, while we do some fast news.
6988000	6990000	And if you don't submit tweets, I'm going to let Jessica just tweet all night.
6991000	6992000	Tweet, tweet!
6992000	6994000	And then I'll play the Rockin' Robin song, and then let her do the tweet, tweet.
6995000	6996000	Tweet, tweet, tweet!
6997000	6999000	Exactly. Alright, in the meantime, quick news. Logan.
7000000	7011000	Oh my god, you better run out in a hurry and pick up Outrun Online Arcade, because if you procrastinate for another 13 months, then you may not be able to get it.
7012000	7020000	That's right, because apparently their license agreement with Ferrari is going to be up, and so because of that, it's going to be taken offline.
7020000	7027000	No offense, but I think at that point, no one's going to remember that that game ever came out, and it probably won't matter.
7028000	7034000	But yes, see at first when I first read this, I didn't realize it was 2011, I'm like, oh okay, well a couple months, then maybe we should act now.
7035000	7038000	But a year and a couple months? Eh.
7039000	7044000	But it's Outrun! Like, I don't have 50 million other versions of Outrun.
7044000	7054000	It's a bummer that it's getting pulled for kind of a, well I mean it's an understandable reason, but also at the same time it's kind of dumb, but at least it's not getting pulled because it sucks.
7055000	7059000	For her it's just like, we have loads of cash, we are Italian, go ahead and have it.
7060000	7063000	They shouldn't be dicks is really what it comes down to.
7063000	7073000	Back to the Future apparently is getting a brand new release, the 25th anniversary trilogy that's coming out on Blu-Ray.
7074000	7080000	Also with that though, if you happen to purchase that, a voucher for a free episode of Telltale's new game.
7081000	7085000	That's right, the Back to the Future video game, and not the crappy one that was on the NES.
7086000	7087000	I liked that one.
7088000	7089000	But you will agree, it was crappy.
7089000	7093000	It was crappy, it's like, you know, it was the E.T.
7094000	7098000	It wasn't so bad, Back to the Future 2 and 3 was the E.T. of the NES.
7099000	7105000	The Back to the Future pinball was really good though, except Michael J. Fox would not let people use his likeness so it's somebody else on there.
7106000	7107000	There are, is it Eric Stoltz?
7108000	7109000	No, I don't think it's Eric Stoltz.
7110000	7115000	There are all these kind of old NES games, everybody has that old school 8-bit NES game that really sucks, but you still love it.
7116000	7117000	You know what I mean?
7117000	7118000	Yeah.
7119000	7120000	Anyway, sorry.
7121000	7122000	Anyways.
7123000	7126000	But the Back to the Future is kind of a big deal. The Blu-Ray is kind of a big deal, it's getting a lot of like-
7127000	7128000	You know what's kind of weird though?
7129000	7132000	Is they've already given away the coupon code, I guess.
7133000	7143000	I don't know if it's going to be exclusive to each one or if it's this thing, but it says apparently there is a picture of the actual code thing.
7143000	7155000	It says, the URL insert lists the URL for redeeming the included code one two one gigawatts, which currently directs the browsers to the game's homepage.
7156000	7162000	It says, of course, it will go live as they get closer to it.
7162000	7173000	So, I don't know if one point two or one two one gigawatt is going to be the code, but hey, something a little extra if you buy Back to the Future.
7174000	7178000	And you should, because it's an awesome movie series and they keep replaying it on G4 for some reason.
7179000	7182000	And I'm pretty sure the game this time will be much better than the NES one. Just call it a hunch.
7183000	7184000	Oh, yeah.
7185000	7187000	Because they have Christopher Lloyd actually doing voice acting and all that, right?
7188000	7189000	Yes.
7189000	7196000	Get him to say as many things as possible before he dies. I mean, seriously, just have him read the whole dictionary and we'll be done with it.
7197000	7198000	He was a Klingon once.
7199000	7200000	That's interesting.
7201000	7202000	Yes.
7203000	7205000	He should host a science show as Doc Brown.
7206000	7207000	That would be awesome.
7208000	7215000	Saig is actually in our chat tonight. Happy to hear about his appearance. He's actually saying that theaters are going to be showing Back to the Future at the end of this month.
7216000	7217000	I guess it's like a revival thing.
7217000	7218000	That's awesome.
7219000	7222000	No, but seriously though, Christopher Lloyd needs to host a sideshow. Screw Bill Nye.
7223000	7229000	Can I be honest about something though? I've never seen the original Back to the Future the whole way through, actually.
7230000	7231000	What?
7232000	7233000	I haven't.
7234000	7241000	Here's the funny thing. I've seen the third movie the whole way through because they showed it like when I was in seventh grade on VHS or whatever.
7242000	7244000	I have never seen the original movie the whole way through.
7244000	7249000	I saw the first one in the theater, the third one in the theater, and I didn't see the second one until I was an adult.
7250000	7253000	There's always that one movie you miss as a kid, except I missed a few.
7255000	7256000	What was your first movie, Rob?
7257000	7258000	My first movie?
7259000	7260000	Do you remember? Were you told?
7261000	7265000	I was told that I was taken to see The Empire Strikes Back at the 99 cent theater.
7266000	7269000	We kind of have something in common then. My first movie was Star Wars.
7270000	7271000	Oh, there you go.
7271000	7280000	The earliest movie I can remember that I saw as I remember waiting in line for opening night for the Masters of the Universe.
7281000	7284000	I remember going to see the Care Bears movie. That's probably the first movie I remember seeing.
7285000	7286000	Care Bears in Wonderland was great.
7287000	7288000	Or Return to Oz. Good God.
7289000	7290000	That movie was awesome.
7291000	7292000	What was your first movie?
7293000	7294000	E.T. at the Drive-In.
7295000	7296000	I'm pretty sure you saw E.T., but the one I can only remember.
7297000	7298000	I saw E.T. in the theater.
7298000	7300000	E.T. was probably before all that.
7301000	7302000	I was what? Five? Six?
7303000	7306000	I also remember going to see The Aristocats by Disney.
7307000	7309000	The first movie that I saw four times in a row, though, was Wrath of Khan.
7310000	7321000	I remember also we went to a drive-in to see, it was a double feature, Shrimp on the Barbie and Batman.
7321000	7327000	And I really wanted to see Batman, and unfortunately Shrimp on the Barbie was...
7328000	7329000	The fuck do those two movies have in common?
7330000	7331000	They always do that.
7332000	7336000	I have no idea, but for some reason, I fell asleep through Batman.
7337000	7341000	And I woke up, I'm like, where's Batman?
7342000	7345000	And my mom's like, we tried to wake you up, but you said you wanted to sleep.
7346000	7347000	I'm like, no, I didn't!
7348000	7349000	Aww.
7349000	7352000	I eventually saw it later on, but no, it was kind of funny, though.
7353000	7356000	Shrimp on the Barbie, yes, that would put you to sleep, I can imagine.
7357000	7362000	But that must have been the second movie, for some reason, because I slept through Batman.
7363000	7372000	Anyways, sorry, since we were talking about movies, though, there of course is rumors that the Uncharted movie needs to move forward.
7372000	7379000	People want this to become a movie, because I guess the game lends itself well to a movie.
7380000	7384000	And funny enough, the main character, which has been compared to Nathan Fillion,
7385000	7394000	actually now Nathan Fillion is trying to start a campaign on Twitter to be cast as Nathan Drake.
7395000	7400000	So that's interesting, because I guess he looks kind of like the main character.
7400000	7403000	He does a little bit, but I don't know.
7404000	7409000	I don't see the entire resemblance there, but he sort of, I mean, it could work.
7410000	7412000	There'd be fanboys that would be very happy if that were to happen, that's cool.
7413000	7414000	I don't know, I'd drool.
7415000	7416000	Dan's only too old.
7417000	7418000	Yeah, Dan's piping in from the other end.
7419000	7421000	You're right, Danny Glover needs to be Nathan Drake.
7422000	7424000	It's okay, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
7424000	7430000	Let's get Betty White to be Nathan Drake.
7431000	7432000	Dan says, should do.
7433000	7434000	Dan approves of Betty White.
7435000	7439000	You need to cast Betty White in like a big blockbuster action flick.
7440000	7444000	I still want to see Red, because, I mean, can you imagine Helen Mirren with an AK?
7445000	7448000	Here you go, an action movie starring Betty White called Grandma Death.
7449000	7450000	I would go see it.
7451000	7452000	You know what, no no no.
7452000	7453000	That's awesome.
7454000	7455000	Well, keep in mind, they did the machete movie, remember?
7456000	7457000	That's true, there you go.
7458000	7460000	You know, the movie based off of a trailer of a non-existent movie?
7461000	7463000	They could do another Grindhouse movie with Betty White in it.
7464000	7465000	Grandma Death?
7466000	7467000	It'd be like Kill Bill, but it's Betty White.
7468000	7469000	Great.
7470000	7471000	Hopefully she does all her own stunts.
7472000	7475000	Too bad Barbara Billingsley is dead, because she could be her co-star.
7476000	7478000	Well, you know what, only if she talked jive.
7478000	7481000	If as long as she gets her before she starts to decompose, it might be alright.
7482000	7485000	I actually, I watched an interview of her about learning to talk jive, by the way.
7486000	7487000	So did I.
7488000	7489000	Yours would be a bit like Kill Ernest.
7490000	7491000	Ernest Borgnine.
7492000	7493000	Yeah.
7494000	7495000	That would be awesome.
7496000	7497000	Let's move on with some news.
7498000	7499000	I don't know how we got onto this whole like, Betty White and Ernest goes together.
7500000	7502000	Actually, you need to go color Bill, so it's Betty White plus Grandma Death.
7503000	7504000	Grandma Death plus Kill Bill equals profit.
7505000	7506000	Alright, let's move on.
7506000	7507000	Crazy.
7508000	7509000	It's Crazy Dexy.
7510000	7511000	It's coming out on November 23rd on the PlayStation Network.
7512000	7513000	November 24th on Xbox Live Arcade.
7514000	7516000	If you're ready to get some crazy money, it's gonna cost you 10 bucks.
7517000	7518000	It will be widescreen.
7519000	7522000	It will have 720p high def graphics.
7523000	7525000	It will not have the offspring music, sadly.
7526000	7527000	And it will not have Pizza Hut.
7528000	7529000	Sorry.
7530000	7531000	Will it have bad religion?
7532000	7533000	All the licensed crap is gone.
7533000	7536000	They are cheap. They are super duper cheap.
7537000	7539000	Wow, what's left? Because I mean that game was all licensed crap.
7540000	7541000	Just the whole driving down that hill.
7542000	7543000	Duh duh duh.
7544000	7547000	All these games have an options menu where you can turn down the music.
7548000	7550000	So what you do is turn down whatever crap music they end up putting in the game.
7551000	7554000	And then do a Xbox 360 custom soundtrack.
7555000	7558000	Why didn't they get new licensing?
7558000	7563000	They did get new licensing. I'm sure KFC would do it in like, you know, Old Navy or something.
7564000	7565000	Take me to Old Navy!
7567000	7568000	No, bitch! Off the pier!
7572000	7573000	You're driving too fast!
7574000	7576000	Take me to the Gap! Not until they change the logo, bitch!
7577000	7578000	They did. They fixed it.
7579000	7581000	No, seriously, get this. Not even that.
7582000	7586000	Because we were talking, for some reason, my non-designer friends were talking about typography with me.
7586000	7590000	And I was like, yeah, they were using Helvetica and it was ugly, a bad use of Helvetica.
7591000	7595000	And so I went to find it and there's no more pictures of it online, except for the Gap logo sucks Twitter.
7596000	7597000	Yeah, it's gone.
7598000	7599000	They hunted that shit down.
7600000	7605000	You know, a kind of interesting point in chat, what if all the licenses had been stuff that is now gone?
7606000	7607000	Like, take me to Tower Records!
7609000	7610000	That would be sad.
7611000	7612000	That would be sadness.
7612000	7614000	Take me to Tower Records! I mean, Dimple!
7615000	7616000	No, they're still there.
7617000	7618000	Wait, wait, I'm sorry.
7619000	7621000	Take me to Tower Records! No, I mean R5! No, I mean Dimple!
7623000	7626000	Or what other big things have closed down lately that just all went under?
7627000	7628000	Take me to Mervins!
7629000	7630000	Can't.
7630000	7631000	Montgomery Wards!
7635000	7636000	Alright, anyhow.
7637000	7638000	Rock band news.
7639000	7640000	Take me to L&L BBQ!
7640000	7641000	Take me to L&L BBQ!
7642000	7647000	There's a whole list of rock band songs available in this little web widget that you can embed in your site.
7648000	7650000	It's in celebration of the 2000th song to hit rock band.
7651000	7654000	You know, going to find research online can be kind of tough.
7655000	7658000	There's a whole little widget that made its way to a lot of gaming blogs.
7659000	7664000	And the cool thing is you can search, you can sort it by artist, you can sort it by year, you can sort it by the genre.
7665000	7667000	And it's just basically like a quick online little web widget to find the finder.
7667000	7672000	So if you want to see, okay, Lady Gaga.
7673000	7674000	Why am I not surprised?
7675000	7677000	There are four Lady Gaga songs in the game.
7678000	7679000	He's gay!
7680000	7681000	What's your point?
7682000	7684000	And then there's one Eric Cartman Lady Gaga song that's in there.
7685000	7686000	Oh that's great.
7687000	7688000	There you go.
7689000	7690000	One more story for you guys, another music game.
7691000	7693000	DJ Hero 2 is getting some download contents.
7693000	7696000	The first comes in November is the first pack.
7697000	7699000	It's going to be the Hit Makers Mix Pack.
7700000	7703000	Rihanna's Umbrella vs Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.
7704000	7705000	That might be kind of interesting.
7706000	7707000	Two weeks later an Electro Hits Mix Pack.
7708000	7709000	That might be kind of awesome actually.
7710000	7716000	There's also, actually the Electro Hits has LMFAO with I'm in Miami trick, because they have to change the lyrics.
7717000	7718000	Mixed with Green Velvet, Shake and Pop.
7719000	7720000	Some of this might be kind of awesome actually.
7720000	7723000	So that's all coming out in November.
7724000	7733000	By the way, there will also be a free compatibility update in November to enable support for the existing DJ Hero DLC in DJ Hero 2.
7734000	7739000	Which is great because the best DJ Hero song was that Mary J. Blige All of Me vs Queen Radio Gaga.
7740000	7741000	There was no better song in the game and it was downloads.
7742000	7743000	That was pretty fantastic.
7744000	7746000	Rob, let's make that our after show music.
7747000	7748000	Maybe. If I can find it.
7748000	7751000	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7752000	7756000	I have stuff. Things. How about some Guitar Hero stuff?
7757000	7761000	I don't think this is enough to save them though, even though I think it's amazing.
7762000	7772000	There is going to be a free 3-pack for Gold members that has Disturbs the Infection, Muses Resistance, cool song.
7773000	7775000	My Chemical Romance's Na Na Na, another band that I like.
7775000	7781000	It will be available to be purchased by Silver Live users on October 19th.
7782000	7786000	And then on the 26th of October there will be a Rocky Horror Picture Show pack.
7787000	7794000	And that's pretty cool. It has Time Warp, and Sweet Transvestite, and Hot Patootie.
7795000	7798000	And also completely unrelated is Soundgarden's Telefantasm.
7799000	7802000	Sadly not enough to get me to spend $60 on the game, but I think it's really cool.
7802000	7807000	And it also reminds me that the Rocky Horror Blu-ray is out, I believe, this Tuesday.
7808000	7810000	So I kind of want to check that out because I'm curious how it turned out.
7811000	7815000	You know, I was saying that that's the only thing that's probably going to remotely get me to watch that show that starts with a G that I don't like.
7816000	7822000	And imagine that. Exactly 10 years after they released the DVD, they released the Blu-ray.
7823000	7826000	Here comes the Blu-ray. And apparently it's got a live shadow cast thing going on in it and all this stuff.
7827000	7830000	Picture in picture. Could be interesting. I don't know. I'm curious.
7830000	7834000	And don't think this whole Rocky Horror Glee thing isn't a cross promotion.
7835000	7839000	I will bet money there's a commercial for the Blu-ray during the Glee episode.
7840000	7842000	Although, you know what I really, really want to see? What?
7843000	7844000	Is Tony Head as Frank.
7845000	7848000	We got to see that at that same convention we played.
7849000	7852000	Because I understand that he brought his own gear.
7852000	7860000	You might still be able to catch it and they'll probably play it a little bit closer but the H1, they were actually filming a karaoke version.
7861000	7867000	You can probably find it on YouTube actually. Of Anthony Head playing Frank.
7868000	7872000	He's so great. I loved the single that he did. That was really great.
7873000	7875000	I'm positive you can find that on YouTube.
7876000	7878000	I'm going to be looking something up tonight when I'm supposed to be doing my homework.
7878000	7882000	Alan very much wants me to watch that Rocky Horror Glee episode.
7883000	7886000	I think Glee is okay. I watched about half the first season and it's fine.
7887000	7891000	But I really am not liking this idea of them doing the Rocky Horror because I know it's just going to be hard to watch.
7892000	7893000	Have you actually watched the stuff that Richard's been posting?
7894000	7896000	I've heard some of the songs that were posted.
7897000	7903000	Watch some of the stuff. I do not watch Glee at all. I will never watch Glee after this.
7904000	7905000	But I'll probably watch this one.
7905000	7909000	I heard the way they did Sweet Transvestite and I'm not a fan.
7910000	7912000	I like the Dammit Janet and some of the other stuff though.
7913000	7915000	But I'm curious. I will watch it.
7916000	7920000	But Alan's like, you need to sit there and live blog it and tape your eyes open. You gotta watch the whole thing.
7921000	7924000	And I'm just kind of like, only if you do too because he hates Glee.
7925000	7931000	I have to say I did look at the stills they had and the sets and costumes looked pretty awesome.
7931000	7937000	I don't like that they had to dumb it down for broadcast TV.
7938000	7943000	I understand you can't have a teenager or somebody portraying a teenager running around in the Rocky costume. I get that. That's fine.
7944000	7946000	But they really really washed down some of the lyrics.
7947000	7950000	I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Sensational Transylvania. Really?
7951000	7953000	It kind of defeats the point, honey.
7954000	7958000	Whatever. Oh well. I'll watch it and it won't be that bad.
7958000	7961000	I think it would be more interesting to visit transsexual than sensational.
7962000	7968000	I should be happy that at least it's getting attention and it'll bring more curious kids to the Midnight movie.
7969000	7970000	And then it'll die off like it always does.
7971000	7972000	Yes. But at least we'll have that moment.
7973000	7978000	But, by the way, they are doing a Rocky Horror show downtown right now.
7979000	7980000	Oh really? I don't want to go.
7981000	7982000	I have no idea.
7983000	7984000	I'll have to send you guys the invite so you can look.
7985000	7986000	Please do.
7986000	7989000	Because it started this past weekend all the way through until Halloween.
7990000	7991000	Let's go.
7992000	7993000	I kind of want to go. I have no idea.
7994000	7996000	Remember we saw when ARC put it on.
7997000	7998000	That was cute.
7999000	8000000	That was great.
8001000	8002000	We should all go.
8003000	8004000	We'll have a group date.
8005000	8006000	Alan won't mind if I take two women out.
8007000	8008000	You'll have to have him a threesome.
8009000	8010000	It's Sister Wives Night.
8010000	8012000	You'll take your harem out.
8013000	8015000	Alright. What else, DarkSagra?
8016000	8017000	Oh, other news.
8018000	8020000	Dead Space is going to be coming out on the iPad.
8021000	8023000	It will be out in December according to EA.
8025000	8031000	They're saying that there's a big press event at Tokyo's Apple Store that will be featuring this.
8032000	8034000	And it's a third person shooter.
8034000	8039000	No rails. No changing modes. Nothing said about the iPhone.
8040000	8044000	So maybe it will be better than the Xbox Live Arcade version.
8045000	8046000	Who cares?
8047000	8052000	Xbox Live Arcade, other news, is in nine more countries now.
8053000	8054000	Starting on the 10th of November.
8055000	8057000	Maybe not now, but in the future.
8058000	8060000	It will be in Russia, Poland, Russia.
8060000	8066000	South Africa, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile.
8067000	8069000	Welcome to the wave of the future.
8070000	8071000	I mean, the wave of four years ago.
8072000	8075000	And for the record, I actually sat and watched four hours of the mine rescue and it was amazing.
8076000	8077000	Did you? I did.
8078000	8080000	I couldn't tear my eyes off of it like the very first night.
8081000	8086000	I must go to bed, but it's 2 a.m., but I have to see number seven.
8086000	8089000	I read about it on CNN. I didn't watch a minute of it.
8090000	8096000	You know what I thought was awesome about it is that it totally wasn't the overblown media circus that it would have been in America.
8097000	8102000	And the freaking president came out by himself without guards or anything to help with the effort.
8103000	8105000	To be there with the families. And that was cool.
8106000	8108000	I was reminded of, pardon the pun, baby Jessica.
8109000	8110000	Watching that whole thing. Remember?
8111000	8112000	Back in the day. Back in the day.
8113000	8114000	Way before most of our listeners were born.
8114000	8118000	You know what? I read an interview with her where she grew up and says, God, I can't believe people remember me for that.
8119000	8123000	Well, yeah. Can you imagine being her? Like, you don't remember that shit. She was like a year and a half.
8124000	8125000	That's really what she seems like. I don't remember any of this.
8126000	8127000	Yeah. And I guess the whole-
8128000	8129000	Oh, shit. I fell down a well. Gee.
8130000	8131000	Well, here's the-
8132000	8133000	I'm alive now. Yay.
8134000	8135000	Here's the part. Here's the thing, honey.
8135000	8144000	She got like a million dollars worth of money. Like people just sent gifts, money, unsolicited, but people just sent like baby Jessica college money.
8145000	8146000	I think she's saying that's how she went to school.
8147000	8151000	Yeah. And she all got put in a trust fund and like, I want to say I was reading online like next year or something.
8152000	8156000	She's getting like a million dollars because it's all been saved and growing and all that stuff. So, you know, honey-
8157000	8161000	Here's a lesson to mothers. Stop watching your children around wells if you want them set for life.
8162000	8162000	Nice.
8162000	8164000	This is what we teach here in America.
8165000	8166000	Nice.
8167000	8171000	Or you just need to have like eight kids all at once and everybody will give you tons of money for diapers and crap.
8172000	8175000	And wear fake Dolce & Gabbana glasses and drink your Starbucks every morning.
8176000	8177000	Yep.
8178000	8186000	But this means that now Xbox Live is servicing 35 countries at once. It sure gets around.
8187000	8188000	In a row?
8189000	8190000	That's 37, dude.
8190000	8192000	So we just need to give it two more.
8193000	8195000	It can service Luxembourg.
8196000	8199000	Try not to service any more countries on your way to the parking lot.
8202000	8208000	All right. If that's it for the rapid news tonight, let's get to the Twitter topics.
8209000	8211000	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
8211000	8221000	Tweet.
8222000	8226000	And I'm going to let her say tweet because we didn't get a whole lot tonight, but we'll do some that we got.
8227000	8230000	This is our buddy Rob with two B's. He's on Twitter as Railgun Games.
8231000	8237000	He says, what happened to the big box stores boycotting third party Wii games that are nothing but mini games?
8238000	8239000	That's a good question.
8239000	8240000	Do you know anything about this, Loki?
8241000	8243000	Weren't stores supposed to be boycotting Wii games that were nothing but mini games?
8244000	8245000	I remember hearing about this too. It was on the show.
8246000	8247000	I think they do to a certain extent.
8248000	8255000	I mean, most stores nowadays realize that only the first party or big third party games are really the only things they're selling.
8256000	8259000	So they're buying a lot less of the third party games that are just crap.
8260000	8263000	As they should be doing with their dollars.
8263000	8273000	But I don't think people are, well, I'm sure there's some stores that are outright forgetting to bring in certain games to their stores because they're absolute crap.
8274000	8275000	Or they're bringing in one copy.
8276000	8283000	I could see that, but I don't think they're saying, we will not carry anymore of these Imagine games because they're crap.
8284000	8286000	I mean, they're not going to outright say that.
8287000	8288000	Imagine babies.
8290000	8291000	Tweet, tweet.
8291000	8294000	Alright, moving on to other tweets.
8295000	8300000	Tigerclaw305 sends us some links, and I always let him get in a couple tweets here because there's good stuff.
8301000	8302000	I haven't heard this one either.
8303000	8308000	Apparently one of the EA developers is saying, and this is a pretty ballsy thing to say from a tweet, again, sent to us from Tigerclaw.
8309000	8313000	Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs.
8314000	8315000	What?
8316000	8317000	What?
8317000	8326000	This is like, that's really interesting to hear because I was under the assumption that this is going to be as close to WoW as it gets, you know what I mean?
8327000	8328000	And I'm not talking, again, I don't want to like...
8329000	8330000	It'll be WoW without the suck.
8331000	8332000	I don't want to make, girl.
8333000	8337000	I don't want to make it sound like WoW and another big MMO are capable of coexisting.
8338000	8338000	I earned a girl.
8339000	8342000	It doesn't have to be that you can, you know, this has to take away from WoW.
8342000	8348000	But I always thought that this was really going to be the next big MMO, so it's kind of interesting that this whole thing is coming up here.
8349000	8351000	DDR Dollar Bill says, I thought APB was the fail.
8352000	8358000	Well, it's coming from an EA Mythic employee who's going to be laid off next month, and they unloaded on the division for the Old Republic.
8359000	8362000	Apparently it has to do with why Warhammer crashed in Bird. Here's the thing.
8363000	8368000	They've spent more money, this is according, again, to the person who was laid off or whatever.
8368000	8375000	They spent more money making the Old Republic than James Cameron spent on Avatar, shit you not, 300 million dollars.
8376000	8377000	And you know what they're most proud of? This is the kicker.
8378000	8379000	They're most proud of the sound.
8380000	8382000	Something like a 20 gig installation and most of it is voiceover work.
8383000	8385000	That's the best they have. The rest of the game is a joke.
8386000	8387000	EA knows it and so does George Lucas.
8388000	8394000	They're panicking and so much of Mythic has already been cannibalized to work in Austin on it because they can't keep pushing back launch.
8394000	8401000	Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs from EA, probably at the level of The Sims Online. We all know it too.
8402000	8409000	Now he could just be being bitter about the whole layoff thing, so take it with a grain of salt, but that's the first really really negative thing I've heard about it.
8410000	8412000	Aren't they doing top secret testing right now?
8413000	8419000	I heard somewhere that there is testing going on for the game right now, but it's under super duper NDA lock and key.
8420000	8421000	So that's why you're not hearing a lot of stuff externally.
8421000	8424000	You think some loudmouth is going to come out and dispute this.
8425000	8426000	I don't know.
8427000	8429000	Anyhow, one other quick story from Tigerfly.
8430000	8431000	They're doing it under the name Final Fantasy XIV.
8432000	8434000	He sent me a few, but I'm going to stick with two here.
8435000	8436000	Tweet, tweet!
8437000	8438000	Yes, he sent two tweets.
8439000	8441000	Apparently Mike Tyson's punch out has been reimagined on the iPhone.
8442000	8443000	I mean, ripped off.
8443000	8452000	Pretty much. Let's see, Rock Software created this game. You fight as a character named Lil Sammy, and then eventually you take on Mike Tyson.
8453000	8459000	I have no idea if they actually got a license or whatever, but you go through ten fights that lead up to Tyson.
8460000	8462000	There it is, and there's a whole little picture there.
8463000	8465000	It should be a better Evander Holyfield.
8466000	8467000	You should play as Lil Mike.
8467000	8472000	I'm curious if they actually have the licensing, because that could be very bad for them if not.
8473000	8476000	He probably needs the money, so he's like, you can do it for five dollars.
8477000	8478000	That could be, or I'll bite your ear off.
8479000	8480000	It's going to be 99 cents though.
8481000	8482000	Spazinator wants to give us a heads up.
8483000	8487000	There's a free episode of Sengoku Basara Samurai Warriors anime on the PSN video store right now.
8488000	8490000	Could that have anything to do with the game that just came out?
8491000	8491000	Who knows?
8492000	8493000	It's a mystery to everyone.
8493000	8497000	Alright, here's an old-time Q&A from SSG100Matt. Thank you, SSG100Matt.
8498000	8499000	Tweet, tweet!
8500000	8507000	With the 400th episode coming up, have you thought about getting the DDR gang back together and doing an episode at RVGL?
8508000	8518000	Last time we did an episode at RVGL we almost got kicked out.
8519000	8521000	However, here's an idea I do like.
8521000	8522000	Think about this, folks.
8523000	8528000	For our 400th episode, I bet we could find a local pizza joint to loan us their buffet room.
8529000	8534000	And Logie, the tech master, I'm sure has a way for us to broadcast over his little Wi-Fi thingamabobber so we can do it.
8535000	8536000	Well, we can figure it out.
8537000	8538000	Or I'm sure the restaurant might let us use it if we bring in enough business.
8539000	8542000	You know, we could go to one of these pizza joints, like a round table or a straw hat or something,
8543000	8546000	and get a bunch of people from the old DDR days there.
8546000	8550000	Like, obviously, Iguana Girl would be invited, but get some of our Bay Area friends.
8551000	8552000	Maybe we would even do it in the Bay.
8553000	8554000	Mountain Mike's.
8555000	8556000	Step Squad and RTF.
8557000	8559000	That's a good idea. The old school Mountain Mike's in Concord.
8560000	8564000	And that would be a nice middle place because it would only be about an hour and ten minutes away from here.
8565000	8566000	Excellent idea.
8567000	8568000	And they do have good pizza.
8569000	8570000	And decent beer.
8571000	8572000	Are they still there? Do they still have DDR?
8573000	8574000	As far as I know.
8574000	8578000	We would love to do that for the 400th episode and try to get all the old school people we can.
8579000	8583000	It might be tricky on a Sunday night, but we're 14 weeks away.
8584000	8587000	It's going to be in mid-January, I think, is when we hit 400.
8588000	8589000	We've got time to plan it.
8590000	8592000	That's just my fantasy dream thing.
8593000	8599000	Another thing to consider is that maybe I could sweet talk a particular friend of mine
8599000	8604000	who is married to another friend of mine who has a DDR solo machine in their garage.
8605000	8606000	I knew who you were talking about.
8607000	8608000	Nudge! Nudge!
8609000	8610000	I'll have to talk to them separately.
8611000	8612000	Theirs is wired with a Playstation in theirs.
8613000	8613000	Yeah, but it's still cool.
8614000	8616000	I have the guts for a DDR machine, just no pads.
8617000	8618000	They have a solo in no game.
8621000	8622000	So that's what I do.
8624000	8625000	You take your thing and put it in their thing.
8625000	8629000	And then you make a brand new thing.
8630000	8638000	It's technically a Dance Maniacs J-Append right now, but it could easily be converted into a DDR machine.
8639000	8640000	Sorry, I'm...
8641000	8644000	And actually, we could run 1.5 on that machine without any modifications,
8645000	8651000	because 1.5 and EuroMix, I think, in one don't require the flash drive.
8651000	8655000	I have to post this in our chatroom, I'm sorry, this is totally unrelated,
8656000	8658000	but Alan likes to send me funny shit during the show just to get me to crack up on air,
8659000	8662000	and he sent me this picture from Trader Joe's of an advertisement for Gunby Bears,
8663000	8667000	but look very carefully at the little Bryce tag.
8668000	8669000	Link! Link! Link!
8670000	8672000	I'll post that in chat right now, that's great.
8673000	8675000	So that she who is near-sighted can see it.
8676000	8677000	I love how they...
8678000	8679000	That is fantastic!
8679000	8682000	I love Trader Joe's, I really do, it's the best grocery store.
8683000	8684000	I'm saving this.
8685000	8687000	Anyhow, also, lots of change on Twitter.
8688000	8692000	I have not recognized that name as a tweeter in the past, so happy tweeting to you.
8693000	8695000	What's your favorite game with Batman?
8698000	8700000	Well, that kind of narrows it down.
8701000	8703000	It was that one game with Batman.
8704000	8706000	I would have to go with Arkham Asylum.
8706000	8708000	Fuck you, I like Superman 64!
8709000	8710000	Ewww!
8711000	8712000	Is Batman even in that?
8713000	8714000	Hopefully DC Universe...
8715000	8717000	It's a joke, Loki, it's what we call a joke here on the show.
8718000	8723000	Well, no, I thought it is a game that is in the DC Universe,
8724000	8726000	I thought that maybe Batman had a cameo in it.
8727000	8729000	I'm Batman, and I declare that this game...
8730000	8731000	Sucks!
8732000	8734000	To be honest, if it's not going to be DC Universe online, which I'm really hoping,
8734000	8741000	the old school one on the NES, the very first one by Sunsoft to the Batman game on the NES was pretty badass.
8742000	8746000	There was also one on the Commodore 64 that was told in a comic book style, also kind of badass.
8747000	8750000	Bart's nightmare, but I guess that was Bartman, not Batman.
8751000	8752000	I'll take it.
8753000	8755000	Lots of change, we'll take it, and he'll like it.
8756000	8757000	Tweet, tweet!
8758000	8760000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Twitter segment tonight.
8761000	8762000	That's all the tweets.
8762000	8763000	Awww.
8764000	8765000	Tweet!
8766000	8768000	Or I guess we can say Shinobi 2.
8769000	8771000	That's true, because Spiderman was also in that one.
8772000	8773000	It's not really Batman.
8774000	8779000	There were enemies in the game that looked very much like particular other franchises from different comic book companies.
8780000	8782000	Stop being so fucking obscure.
8783000	8786000	I covered it on the classic game, Ron.
8786000	8791000	I'm sorry!
8792000	8794000	Stop sounding like a Japanese girl having sex.
8795000	8796000	That would be...
8799000	8800000	And know that the listeners are deaf.
8801000	8803000	Wow, you do that impression way too well, I'm just saying.
8804000	8805000	I will tell you how I do it way too well.
8806000	8807000	Thank god your mic cut out, that's all I'm saying.
8808000	8809000	I will tell you how I know how to do that.
8809000	8816000	That comes from my dorm room, with a group of us deciding to dub Urotsuki Doji by ourselves.
8817000	8818000	Wow.
8819000	8822000	And every other line was, no, don't touch me there!
8823000	8832000	All I have to say is if we do get the cool 400th episode of The Pizza Place or wherever we have it where we get all the old school DDR people back, we need to bring in a copy of Final Fuck X.
8833000	8835000	You know what, Rob, I found that recently.
8836000	8837000	Or Dance Dance Fuck.
8837000	8839000	I don't remember where that is.
8840000	8844000	If we did do that at Mountain Mics, they have a little side room too, so you could set up a TV in the side room.
8845000	8847000	And everybody stand to block the kids view.
8848000	8849000	Exactly!
8850000	8851000	You have to put, like, what, a red door?
8852000	8853000	But I want to paint it black.
8854000	8855000	Alright.
8856000	8861000	Hey, since Iguana Girl is here with us, sorry, Iguana Girl is here with us, let's do a special...
8862000	8864000	Girl, not girl!
8864000	8866000	Girl!
8869000	8871000	Alright, let's...
8874000	8875000	Here...
8877000	8878000	Let's do...
8881000	8884000	Let's do a game show, yay, an OLR game show, we love game shows at OLR.
8885000	8886000	Game show!
8886000	8893000	This is one of the longest running game shows, in fact, it's kind of funny, I was hanging out with my friend Julie this week, I've known her for years, she's my ex-girlfriend, I've known her for years.
8894000	8895000	I remember just after that.
8896000	8897000	Julie...
8898000	8899000	I remember when you were straight.
8900000	8901000	Used to be, well, you know.
8902000	8903000	I'm one of the only people that could see that, too.
8904000	8905000	You were around during my bi phase, actually.
8906000	8907000	Yes!
8908000	8913000	Alright, anyhow, all that stuff aside, quickly, Julie actually used to help me host the radio show I did in college.
8913000	8919000	And this is a segment we started then, and it's carried over all the way until now.
8920000	8922000	It's a segment we call Listless!
8923000	8929000	And tonight's listless topic is the thing I learned most from DDRFreak.
8930000	8932000	Alright, the thing I learned most from DDRFreak.
8933000	8938000	And the way Listless works is we're going to go around the room and we're going to get everybody's top three answers.
8938000	8944000	But then we go around and each strike one item that is not worthy of the list.
8945000	8947000	And then you guys in our chatroom vote.
8948000	8950000	And the top three is the definitive winner.
8951000	8954000	And there is no contesting the list once it is set in stone.
8955000	8958000	This is a very, it's a highly scientific process.
8959000	8960000	It's made with uranium and shit, okay?
8961000	8962000	That's how scientific this is.
8963000	8964000	Uranium and shit.
8965000	8966000	And Uranus.
8966000	8970000	Wouldn't uranium and shit just make a big, huge, busy puddle?
8971000	8973000	It'd make a very sticky, smelly, but hard.
8974000	8975000	Nuclear poo.
8976000	8977000	Nuclear poo.
8978000	8981000	Great, my boyfriend's asking in chat, what the fuck was Rob's bi-phase, an episode of Melrose Place?
8986000	8992000	Funny enough, a place I used to live was referred to as Melrose Place now, and I know where that was.
8993000	8994000	I know where that was!
8994000	8996000	I know someone who had a bi-phase then.
8999000	9000000	Alright, anyhow.
9002000	9005000	Let's move on and talk about other topics, please, quickly.
9006000	9007000	Your prom's all red again, that's weird.
9008000	9010000	Oh no, I just love bringing up old drama, it's like ten years old.
9011000	9011000	Alright.
9012000	9016000	Which is humorous because I'm actually like friends with one of the old parties again.
9017000	9017000	Oh really?
9018000	9019000	Oh, good times, how's that going?
9020000	9020000	It's fine.
9021000	9021000	Yeah, it's good.
9021000	9023000	It's good, it's good. Alright, anyhow.
9024000	9031000	Let's move on, the list list, and talk about the top three things I learned most on DDR4E.
9034000	9035000	Dark soccer, start us off tonight.
9035000	9036000	I have to start? Okay.
9036000	9037000	Yeah, why not?
9037000	9038000	I learned how to detect werewolves.
9040000	9041000	Good one.
9045000	9046000	I never played but I don't know a lot.
9047000	9050000	Yeah, I was touted as one of the better werewolf game players.
9050000	9054000	You guys stole one of my answers too, there's the epic thread in random chat, right?
9054000	9055000	The werewolf game?
9055000	9056000	Yeah.
9056000	9057000	Good times.
9057000	9060000	Alright, Jessica Harper, why don't you go next, what's your number three answer?
9062000	9065000	I learned that trolls are more popular and more respected than mods.
9070000	9075000	Trolls are more popular than mods, is there any reason why you say that?
9075000	9079000	Because they end up with like a...
