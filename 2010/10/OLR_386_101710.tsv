15547	16087	2017 to 2010.
16828	24197	Fans petitioned for a new Bomani game release, the developers of Game Room were set to close, and Blizzard takes the enablers of cheating to court.
31843	37286	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37426	42888	We are that show dedicated to video games and gaming and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
42928	45549	You know, we're that show where every gamer has a voice.
45990	46910	My name is Rob Roberts.
46930	49832	I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.
50132	53093	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53293	54674	I apparently feel it boiling water.
55494	56195	That's bad.
56255	58557	That means you're not going to be able to cook anything if you can't boil water.
58577	62601	You're going to be in my league where it's like Hot Pockets and Easy Mac and Cheese.
63202	69167	I was making fake coffee for my French press and didn't boil enough water, so I'm boiling more water.
69187	70268	You fail at boiling water.
70629	72210	That should be a losing screen.
72550	73491	Boil water the game.
73571	74392	I don't know.
74552	76294	Next in Cooking Mama, it's Boiling Mama.
77255	79077	Say hello, but don't boil mama.
79237	79797	That would be...
80678	81199	Triple Bacon Pizza
97751	106141	So let's see, last week it was double bacon pizza, and I seem to distinctly remember the one and only Loki saying something about triple bacon pizza is too much bacon.
106882	109926	I can't remember if it did triple or quadruple, so I'm testing both.
109946	114211	I almost did quadruple today, but I was like, ramp it up slowly.
114712	116214	It's really good, actually.
116434	118635	I just want to point out I have a terrible Loki impersonation.
118955	120116	It's triple bacon pizza.
120196	121156	I don't know what I'm doing.
121656	121936	Hi.
122317	122917	Also say hello.
122937	124277	We have a very special guest tonight.
124297	125618	I promised this last week.
125658	128839	If you haven't heard the podcast, though, we do have a very special guest.
129199	138303	You could call it a little bit of all games cross promotion in a way because we have here live in studio, not on Skype, but here live in studio all the way from Under Sedation Live.
138323	139484	Say hello to Jessica Harper.
139504	139804	Jessica Harper.
139844	142507	Hello people, yes, I'm actually sitting on the floor.
142767	144569	Yes, as opposed to on the toilet.
144629	147632	As opposed to on the toilet, which is where I usually am right before the show.
148453	149714	How are you, lovely Jessica?
149734	156481	I am doing just fabulously, and yeah, it's kind of cool to have like... We had our all games moment just a few minutes ago where it was...
156941	162307	Bobby Blackwolf and OLR and Understation Live all in one little happy family right there.
162387	163228	So that was kind of cool.
163468	163968	Absolutely.
164008	166271	So while Jessica brought it up let me get that out there.
166291	174499	We do tape live at All Games Radio www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
174519	179404	And if you are listening live make sure you join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
179784	180444	I think that's everything?
180544	180985	I think that's good.
182265	186588	So, Jessica Harper, you might know her online as Iguana Girl.
187088	187268	Yes.
187688	189489	And that's because you are actually an iguana?
190350	191670	Yes, actually, yes.
192131	197874	In the middle of the night, I just have these moments where I turn green and I don't turn into the Hulk, I just turn into an iguana.
198954	205678	No, actually, the nickname originally was given to me by a friend because I had an obsession with iguanas.
205758	207079	I had an iguana at the time and
207799	217763	and Girl, G-R-R-L, was because I was always the video gamer geek out of all of the boys that worked over at this ISP, this internet service provider that we were at.
217823	220244	So I was the, you know, the girl.
220324	224045	I wasn't totally, you know, frilly and prissy and all that.
224085	229608	Now see, I always thought it might have been a hey girl type of thing, but I guess that's G-U-R-L.
229688	229848	Yeah.
229868	232929	Because when Alan types in an email to me, he'll say G-U-R-R-L.
232969	234629	Yeah, no, mine was more, you know, the...
236070	238312	Female Empowerment, Grr.
240453	241254	I'd want to smash.
241694	242674	It just kind of stuck.
243435	246277	I've been using that nickname since like 97 now, I think.
246697	247057	Awesome.
247538	249059	So yeah, just always been that way.
249379	249759	All right.
250179	255743	Well, Jessica's here tonight for, you know, well, obviously we've been doing this show forever and she's never sat in.
255823	258365	I don't think you, well, maybe it's been a long time if you haven't.
258745	259446	We've done top 10s.
260106	264149	Mary, maybe like a long time ago, but it's definitely been several years since you've been here in the studio with us.
264309	270154	I think the last time was probably back at your place, like in Rancho.
270174	275518	Yeah, we were doing the crossover stuff for DDR Freak Radio, and I was like, hey, our shows can get along, it's great, we're having fun.
275598	277560	Didn't we do the top ten Bimani songs of that year?
277620	278741	No, I remember going out to Folsom.
279241	281343	Yeah, yeah, I think we taped the show or something.
281443	297460	Anyway, regardless, it's been a heck of a long time since Jessica's been on the show, which is kind of bittersweet in a way because Jessica and I kind of started in a way a lot of our internet radio stuffs together over on Under Sedation Live when the head honcho over there, Travis, used to live out here.
297600	298762	Yeah, and I'm back, bitches.
298902	299663	The HBIC.
301184	323497	For Understation Live, Travis used to live out here in Sac, and Jessica, myself, and Travis were all kind of the start of that show So this show, in a way, Orange Sounds Radio, in a way, I don't want Travis' ego to get too big if he's listening, but in a way In a way, please No, it is, it's a spin-off of Understation Live No, because you started OLR pretty soon, I think we were like right in tandem with DDR Freak Radio and OLR
324578	325378	Right about the same time
344395	359157	but like but for but you know and I think I mentioned this during the marathon show or something like you know it's it's kind of you know funny the way things work sometimes because obviously this is 10 years ago and at this time you know we're we're in our 20s and just very different and there was a lot of stuff going on and a lot of
359917	366598	I was personally looking back in a very toxic situation at the time that didn't bode itself well to the future.
366679	367799	And, you know, things happen.
367839	371319	Unfortunately, Jessica and I kind of, we had a little breakup for a while.
372620	373920	But we're cool now.
374320	377201	And I think it's great that she's back in the radio business.
377321	379321	And I've listened to a few episodes of Understation Live.
379821	382942	Whether Travis knows it or not, I really do listen once in a while when I can.
383122	383842	I know, I know.
383862	384602	I'm in a tie of shock.
384742	385342	I know, I know.
385422	387123	I know all the smack he's talking about me over there.
387143	387743	I don't think, I don't know.
388423	390525	But, yeah, no, I think it's great.
390665	391606	I think it's just awesome.
391626	394389	You see, what I should have done is I should have made him play the voicemail.
395750	402557	Considering that that voicemail was recorded during that same trip where you played DDR for the first time.
402897	405019	It's true, and I don't have a copy of that.
405159	410104	So, Travis, if you're listening, if you want to, you know, later on when we're taking calls.
410244	410424	Yes.
410704	411045	Yeah.
411785	415466	And the voicemail she's referring to is, I guess we should tell this story real quick.
415486	417727	We will get into the gaming news and all that stuff in a little bit.
417747	427690	But the way Jessica and I kind of got into DDR in the first place, and if it wasn't for DDR, I would probably not have ultimately met DarkSakura and Loki, at least in the way that I did.
428090	433752	But the way Jessica and I got into DDR in the beginning is that we went to the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror Picture Show convention.
434412	435952	And then we just, what happened?
435972	438153	We just kind of said screw it to the convention one night, right?
438173	438253	Yeah.
438653	445257	We just decided that we were going to go hit some arcades because we were bored out of our minds and there was this 1.5 machine.
445377	445957	That's right.
446057	450680	This machine that was flashing and it was saying, I'm playing super gay music.
450720	451300	Come play.
451320	452060	It's fun.
452100	452781	Super gay music.
452821	453861	And Rob went like a fly.
454162	455142	I'm off to a flame.
455402	455983	Exactly.
456003	456963	It was fun.
457543	461365	But yeah, it's like, oh, it has a pad and I wonder what we're supposed to do.
461385	461626	Yeah.
463367	465208	What ultimately drew you to the machine, though?
465228	466709	It couldn't be the uber gay music.
466729	471012	You must have just been like, it's colors, and you use your feet.
471193	473674	I guess I had a new shiny moment, I'm guessing.
475155	477457	But yeah, and what was our first song?
477697	478058	You remember?
478883	481666	I want to say it had to have been the one star Have You Never Been Mellow.
482607	482968	No.
483068	485250	Do we pump it up to Boom Boom Dollar?
485270	488034	We went Boom Boom Dollar first and we failed.
490657	497444	And then we proceeded to go right back and go, okay, well maybe we should try this again, but let's do it on an easier level.
497605	499246	And then we ended up doing Butterfly.
500427	506452	and then once we beat Butterfly we went back to Boom Boom Dollar and I think we ended up beating it the second time.
506732	529530	I think there was a little bit of ego there because I remember we used to play the old Busta here in the US it was Busta Groove but of course that drives Jamie bonkers because overseas it was Busta Move but we didn't know any better at the time because we were just like ooh flashy so but we used to play those games and really liked it so we were like oh we're the masters at Busta Move or Busta Groove we'll kick this thing's ass and it's like failed.
530470	534772	I remember going to your old apartment and playing on that one pad that was for some Disney game.
536812	541694	Or like some child's... I thought it was like a Britney's dance pad or something.
541974	551538	The very first... Before DDR was on PlayStation 1, they actually released a Disney's Jungle Book, Jungle Blue game.
551938	555559	And it came with this dance pad that was probably made for a seven-year-old.
556319	561682	And, you know, it was a cheap little dance game that I think was really just existed to beat DDR to the market.
561962	563622	But it had some funny Jungle Book songs on it.
563642	563903	It was cute.
563923	567824	Because you could dance to, you know, I want to walk like you, talk like you, too.
568505	569525	You know, you could kind of dance to it.
569565	569945	It was cute.
570366	575888	And then DarkSakura, she was kind of like, by this time we knew her, and she was kind of like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
575968	578409	You need a little plug in the back and you need to burn a copy of Third Mix.
578469	579129	I'm coming over.
579149	581410	I was like, Rob, get me a paperclip.
582011	582491	Okay.
582711	588014	Back in those days when you could do the single swap, which I never learned how to do anything but the single swap.
588034	588715	I was like, screw it.
588735	590075	I'll just get this little thing and plug it in.
590476	590996	See, I was lucky.
591016	594658	I actually got to have mine semi-professionally modded by Brad.
596659	599801	And then I remember a bunch of folks came over one night.
599841	602022	I think it was the first night we were playing third mix.
602703	604624	And weren't you fortunate enough not to?
606109	606709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
634079	639845	I remember a later Las Vegas trip that you and I took where we went to that same DDR machine.
640246	640426	Yep.
640987	641567	Very drunk.
642188	642548	Oh, yes.
642768	642869	Yes.
642929	643890	And called Rob.
643910	649716	We're like, hey, we're actually wasn't exactly the same because it was a fourth or a fourth plus.
650317	651438	No, we went to win a circus circus.
651838	654059	Yeah, but there was a fourth or a fourth plus at the time.
654159	654499	That's it.
654519	659721	They had removed the 1.5 and they moved it to the front of that same arcade area.
659741	663922	Because for those that don't know, Circus Circus in Vegas has like 5 billion arcades to it.
664062	664543	Seriously.
665183	670205	And there's like one arcade where we ended up finding a karaoke machine, but that's, you know, a different story for...
671465	672687	for Travis to find the music.
672707	680762	That's a whole nother episode and that'll probably be on Understation Live when Travis is like, hmm, let's make an ass of Rob this week again.
682845	684308	I got me a car.
684368	684989	Okay.
685697	687799	Sounds like you leave them so many opportunities.
688899	689540	You know what?
689600	690100	What can I say?
690140	692402	I was young and dumb in my 20s and I'm young and dumb now.
692442	692962	Okay, bye.
695504	698526	I have like a whole list of Rob quotes that go through my head.
698546	700648	I'm surprised there's not a Rob soundboard that Travis has.
700668	702069	You know, we actually considered it.
705291	705731	Mike fail.
705931	706352	Mike fail.
706372	706972	Boop, boop.
707012	707292	Hey!
708513	708713	Better?
708833	709994	I was going to stop and get you a cord.
710034	712636	If I hadn't driven five hours today, I was going to stop and get you a cord.
712938	716420	I remember a trip to Miggle.
717480	718140	No, it wasn't.
718260	725884	It was Sunnyvale Golf Land where I was drinking out of the Pepsi bone and I gave Rob a drink and he gave it back to me.
725924	727925	And right when I'm drinking, Rob says, by the way, I have gay.
729706	731208	You cut out right as you said that.
731649	732170	Oh, shit.
732270	733271	Your mic sucks.
733311	733692	I hate it.
733892	734473	It's not the mic.
734493	734994	It's the cord.
735094	735495	Whatever.
736036	742746	But, no, I let Rob take a drink out of my big Pepsi bone, and then I took it back to take a drink, and Rob says, by the way, I have gay.
744108	744869	That was the best ever.
745950	747270	DarkSakura.com
773064	775827	I have a complaint about the PlayStation charging controller thing.
776247	778770	The little micro USB cable thing.
779110	779891	It's too damn short.
781032	783134	Seriously, do people in Japan have no room in their apartment?
783634	784335	No, I guess they don't.
786117	789500	So I played some Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they totally stole the ship.
790821	792843	And with the Shiva sisters who are sexy.
794365	796407	Dude, they turn into a freaking bike.
796874	797154	I don't care.
825965	839667	and you can't really change the way they look or anything because the Breen wear this like suit that keeps it you know zero degrees cold inside because they all want to look like you know Princess Leia in her outfit from when she went to rescue Han Solo yeah
840546	840726	Yeah.
841467	841927	Um, so anyway.
843668	846030	And I played, uh, lots of Plants vs. Zombies.
847111	847551	Duh.
848312	852175	And I played, um... I tried Narbacular Drop again.
852896	854197	It's still confusing as hell.
855257	855858	And, uh...
859593	860574	Yes, I have a grudge.
861334	861614	Mud.
862695	869318	For the record, I watched three Ju-on movies also during the course of yesterday and the day before.
870838	872339	And they were fantastic, as always.
873119	876381	And DarkSakura's responding to comments in our chat room at chat.orange.com.
876401	877621	Because I can make the grudge noise.
877641	878362	She doesn't have Tourette's.
878462	878802	She's just...
879282	882764	My little side giggle was because I saw that Travis was saying something.
884365	885586	Oh god, did he join chat?
885806	887046	Uh oh.
887086	888287	He says, I will torment all.
888587	890528	Uh oh.
891249	901494	Which means he's probably recording the whole show tonight to snip out the really bad and horrible sounding parts and he'll string it all together and make it sound like I said something really bad.
901514	902875	Because if I say it now, then he'll cut it out.
903348	905290	and Spazinator for the record.
905750	909894	I actually don't have a micro USB extension, so it didn't work.
911596	913638	You have USB extension cables you can get.
913778	919904	I know, but I was busy playing the game last night in my pajamas and I am not one of those people who goes to Walmart in my pajamas.
920224	922587	But you should have a fully charged controller.
923783	928745	And I didn't want to use a hub because the only hub that I have is my TARDIS hub that was a gift to me from the lovely Tiara.
929425	934607	And my TARDIS hub stays firmly attached to my computer.
935627	937148	But it makes TARDIS noise when you plug it in.
937928	939709	I have a couple of friends that have that.
939769	940149	It's cute.
941089	941349	Alright.
941710	942570	Is that it for your gaming week?
943570	943770	Yes.
944451	945571	Sonic screwdriver doesn't work though.
946616	948457	Oh, boo-hoo, cry, sad.
948837	950278	Loki, hey, how was your gaming week?
951438	952299	I didn't play a whole lot.
952359	956421	I played a lot of iPad games, or iPod games, I guess.
956481	959362	I keep wanting to call it an iPhone, but, I mean, it's the same damn thing.
960723	961523	How about iOS?
961823	963344	Because that's the universal system they run on.
963384	965885	Okay, yeah, I can do iOS.
966385	967466	Some iOS games.
968686	970387	I actually downloaded Bookworms.
970767	972288	I swear, my co-worker...
974072	976975	Download shit and he's like, he's like, yeah, I got this game.
977015	978296	But I'm like, oh, I got to get that.
979057	979538	I don't know why.
979758	984682	But yeah, I jumped on the bookworm train good 10 years late.
985483	989087	And yeah, it's pretty fun and played quite a bit of that.
989287	992190	Actually, my wife was playing at the same time on her iPod.
992730	993651	So that was fun.
995413	997695	And then I've been playing a lot of Climber.
998235	998715	Oh, I saw that.
1025612	1028294	I actually played that while I was waiting for my pizza to be done.
1028314	1029375	Did they add fire?
1030035	1031036	There is fire in there.
1031076	1032037	Oh, they did make it better.
1034239	1037661	The first time I played it, I was like, there's only one awesome thing this game is missing, and that's fire.
1037941	1039202	It's got lots of skulls.
1039262	1042965	It has mountains with earthworm-type tentacle things coming out of it.
1043686	1045787	It's got pentagrams.
1048089	1048790	It's going to be awesome.
1049730	1050111	Is that it?
1050171	1050751	Best 99 cents ever.
1052236	1053237	Put that away right now.
1056340	1057341	Anything else you played this week?
1057361	1058682	Hey John, we're calling to you.
1058742	1059443	Grand Theft Auto.
1059823	1060424	Of course.
1065427	1070770	No, but seriously, I don't know if you've heard the song yet that's in this game, and I will pull it up real quick.
1070970	1071990	Hopefully it's really loud.
1072291	1074112	Let me read some comments from chat while you're doing that.
1074632	1075012	Let's see.
1075152	1077133	Loomies has a suggestion in our chatroom.
1077793	1081315	You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.
1081435	1082816	Did you hear that, DarkSakura?
1083236	1083997	Loomies in our chatroom?
1084037	1084277	What?
1084397	1087939	You can charge the controller at your computer whenever you're not playing the PS3.
1088692	1089392	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob
1112239	1113100	It's so awesome.
1130560	1131281	That was a little bit.
1132001	1132561	Oh, whatever.
1132842	1134142	It's potato-potato to me.
1134182	1135023	I think it's all the same.
1135103	1135403	I don't know.
1136644	1137204	There you go.
1137224	1144489	Chat.orangeandre.com SalaciousPop says, Bookworm and Bookworm Adventures is awesome, except for when it gets really hard and makes you feel stupid.
1144970	1145530	That's very true.
1145550	1149833	Well, like, they were, like, dropping a bunch of letters that were on fire, and it's like Z-Q-U.
1149893	1151454	I'm like, thanks!
1152154	1152875	Love that.
1153135	1154456	I can make Zikwika.
1154856	1157678	What am I going to spell with Q-U-V-Z?
1157838	1158499	Quijibo.
1159599	1160100	And it's like,
1161201	1162382	And Nellie's like, I got to level 15.
1162542	1167347	I'm like, I'm on level 12 with eight letters that I can't use all on fire.
1168208	1170290	That's when you start looking for ass every single time.
1170991	1171571	Ass, ass.
1172012	1173373	Ass, ass, ass.
1173934	1174495	That's what I do.
1174895	1177738	Speaking of words, may I point out a travesty against humanity?
1179445	1181146	Lexulus no longer has solitaire mode.
1181526	1182026	I'm pissed off.
1182326	1183206	Okay, you can continue.
1183586	1187868	And apparently the word dong is not an acceptable word in there.
1187968	1189648	Because I had that and I could have knew.
1189668	1190629	See, that's what we need.
1190669	1192449	We need the sexualized version of Bookworm.
1192589	1198111	But if they did Words with Friends pirate edition, I don't see why they don't do Words with Friends sexy edition.
1198411	1202293	See, this is where I have my problems because I have a Blackberry.
1203393	1205634	They don't have like a Words with Friends-y clone thing?
1205974	1206294	Hell no.
1207154	1208014	I have two folders of games.
1208135	1209135	They're all OpenFaint compatible.
1225382	1228444	I have half a folder of Game Center stuff.
1228864	1234687	That should say something to you, Apple, that perhaps your Game Center is a little too little too late.
1235028	1235508	You know what?
1235588	1239130	On my iPhone, you know what I play that's open faint enabled more than anything else?
1239450	1242392	The Commodore 64 collection that they have on the iPhone.
1242412	1243552	That is so unsurprising.
1244853	1246415	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1264096	1267938	Well, I'm currently mostly an active gamer, unfortunately.
1269099	1275082	Due to circumstances regarding the relationship that I just came from, I had to sell off a lot of my systems.
1275142	1280525	So that pretty much leaves me with my computer that's subpar for gaming.
1280645	1283646	It's my little lappy, and I have a PS2.
1283806	1284246	And that's it.
1284567	1284707	So...
1285888	1292877	But primarily when it comes to games, I have a tendency to... I like to go towards puzzle games.
1293378	1293698	I like...
1296724	1300347	Final Fantasy style RPG, blah, blah, blah.
1300607	1302849	I used to be big into first-person shooters.
1303289	1306131	That was a really big thing for me when I first started gaming.
1307032	1309994	I used to like to piss off the boys by, you know, fragging them constantly.
1310014	1311775	You used to be like a Doom 2 girl, huh?
1311895	1312956	I was a Quake 2 girl.
1313136	1314197	Okay, okay.
1314217	1314798	Yeah.
1315118	1321723	I used to actually go to a place that was here in Sacramento, actually in Citrus Heights, called Cosmic Drip Cyber Cafe.
1322764	1322924	And...
1323464	1324645	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1350764	1352666	Do you have a particular favorite game?
1352707	1355930	Besides the DDR and 2DX we've been reminiscing about, do you have a favorite game?
1355950	1360275	I know I'm putting you on the spot a little bit.
1360355	1361076	I know, I know.
1361436	1362597	Typing of the Dead.
1364499	1366441	Typing of the Dead is up there.
1367462	1370366	And I'd probably get thrown out of the club if I said Final Fantasy VII, so...
1372068	1374049	I don't think there's anything wrong with Final Fantasy 7, love.
1374109	1375569	I get thrown out of the club.
1378290	1379350	This is a safe house.
1379550	1381050	Final Fantasy 9.
1381410	1384031	If you said Final Fantasy 14, I might have an issue.
1384051	1386932	Well, see, again, I haven't been able to game much.
1387192	1389933	I work too dang much, and so I don't get to sit down.
1390013	1394734	Lately, my main game of choice, Price is Right on Facebook.
1394794	1395254	There you go.
1395274	1397735	You know, Rob, they do have a free trial to Final Fantasy 14.
1398855	1424693	I'd heard there's this whole free trial and exit I just, you know, and I gotta really stop hating on Final Fantasy XIV because I didn't play it outside the beta so I'm not being fair I'm only going off of what I heard and everything I've heard is kind of collaborates with my experience in the beta so I feel a little justified but I am being a hater, I guess I'll try it out Please do, I would love to hear your review on this game We should be recording while I play it
1426681	1428964	You get some interesting new expletives to add to this show.
1429144	1431727	Who else is pissed off that they renamed all the races?
1431907	1433009	It makes no sense.
1433770	1435051	Oh, we're gonna give them different names.
1435071	1438215	They're different races, even though they're exactly the same.
1438876	1442600	I gotta read this comment from chat, too, because SalaciousPop, I think, is right on the money here.
1442961	1445504	Sky will stop the show if she says Final Fantasy VIII.
1446965	1449066	I might have thrown her out if she said 8 was her favorite.
1449106	1450366	No, no, no, no.
1450966	1452046	It's not bad.
1455107	1456588	Here's the thing, and I've even told Alan this.
1456628	1459568	I'm like, I kind of play up my hate for 8 on the show a little bit.
1459608	1460189	Hey, hate on 8.
1460229	1461309	Dude, Gunblade.
1461449	1463329	It's a sword and a gun together.
1463970	1468331	But I really hated the whole magic drawing thing.
1468391	1470211	It really ruined the game for me.
1470571	1471271	And that was it.
1471291	1471872	I don't remember that.
1471892	1472652	That was terrible.
1472672	1473512	I must have blocked that out.
1473812	1474894	But it did have a good story.
1475234	1476035	I will agree with you.
1476055	1480541	And the fact that it had the full screen battles as opposed to Final Fantasy VII's crop thing, that was neat.
1480621	1482103	It did have its technological advances.
1482143	1485948	So I will concede on some points, but it still sucks.
1486368	1486649	Alright.
1488291	1490353	Well, if there's nothing else Jessica wants to share...
1490814	1491674	I don't know if there's anything else.
1492074	1497215	Video gaming-wise, that's usually the part of the show on USL where I go silent and just let the boys play.
1498096	1502257	Eventually, I'll get an Xbox and start getting back into the swing of things.
1502517	1502857	Awesome.
1502977	1512119	I hope maybe with some of the price drops that are rumored, either this holiday or next holiday, it'd be really easy for you to get either a Wii or a 360 and you can kind of pick right back up.
1512139	1514099	Yeah, it would be a 360.
1514139	1515700	360 used the refurbisher down to like $109.
1517160	1544055	yeah it's pretty soon within the next month or two you should definitely ask Santa Claus for one you never know alright let me talk about my meet and meet week which is actually kind of short I don't have a whole lot to advertise because you know World of Warcraft kind of dominates a lot of things but I did play a couple new things I played Sonic 4 for a little bit and I can sort of see where Loki was disappointed in last week's review and if you didn't hear his thing on Sonic 4 go listen to last week's
1544944	1548026	I didn't like some of Sonic's controls.
1548507	1553770	Like, I felt like the whole acceleration part of Sonic felt really broken to me.
1554271	1557813	Like, the 0 to 60, if you'll call it, was really weird for me.
1557954	1563237	Here's my thing too, and this is not just a Sonic complaint, this is kind of a complaint of a lot of games that are coming out now.
1564358	1565059	and DarkSakura.
1591721	1592581	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1612694	1613255	But I don't know.
1613415	1616899	I don't know if necessarily Mega Man 10 was really the right step.
1617139	1631817	I actually was a little disappointed in Mega Man 10 simply because Mega Man 10... I expected that Mega Man 10 was going to be this epic, epicness, tenth... I think Mega Man Universe and what's happening there is what I was expecting for Mega Man 10.
1632698	1635381	Mega Man 10 as we got it felt like Mega Man 9 Part 2.
1636201	1637102	If that makes any sense at all.
1637122	1638824	Which, yes, I understand.
1640065	1641306	All the old games are kind of like that.
1641346	1641646	I don't know.
1641666	1648652	I just expected the level of epicness to be raised rather than we're going to get away with the same joke that we did with Mega Man 9.
1648692	1651175	I don't know if that would make sense to anyone else.
1651195	1651775	That makes sense.
1652255	1653417	Done once, it's brilliant.
1653537	1654558	Done twice, it's a gimmick.
1654898	1655498	Exactly.
1655759	1656539	Exactly right.
1656679	1658301	That's kind of where I was at with it.
1658783	1666306	See, what I would want to see is that instead of them doing like what they did with X, if they did like a new X and made it all SNES-tastic.
1667147	1670668	Yeah, that would have been like at least a slightly different gimmick and would have been kind of cool.
1671009	1672249	But whatever, it is what it is.
1672269	1673530	And it's not like a bad game.
1673590	1679633	It's just, you know, it was a little more forgettable than IX because it felt like the same joke as IX all over again.
1679733	1682874	But anyway, how did I get from Sonic 4 to Mega Man?
1682914	1683734	Oh, well, whatever.
1683754	1685035	I guess this whole retro thing.
1685055	1686736	So I think in a way...
1688137	1706763	And maybe it does relate, because in a way, that's where Sonic 4 lost some of its magic for me, is that we've already seen Sonic on Xbox Live Arcade, we've already seen Sonic 2, so it's kind of like to get the Sonic 4 and have it just be kind of like, oh, well now it's the HD graphics, and even when it's the HD graphics, it really doesn't, it just feels like a...
1707955	1709896	A sharper Sonic 2, if you will.
1710676	1711157	You know what I mean?
1711217	1711557	I don't know.
1712017	1716079	But, of course, there's going to be the hardcore Sonic fans that are just going to eat it up, and that's good.
1716099	1717159	They don't care, it's Sonic!
1717420	1724743	However, you've got to admit, it is a little dumpy of them to be doing this whole splitting it up into the episodes to get more money out of it in the long run thing.
1725003	1728665	I do think, especially now having played it, that was kind of a tacky move.
1729045	1732407	And I think it's one that's going to come bite them when it comes to the sales of Episode 2.
1732667	1733067	But we'll see.
1733187	1734128	Prove me wrong, Sonic fans.
1734148	1734408	We'll see.
1735428	1735608	Tasty
1755020	1760703	You breed frogs and you breed them.
1760783	1767267	You might have a purple frog with green spots and you made it with a white frog and you might get a purple frog with white spots.
1767307	1769888	You from Easy Vibe is the pocket frog.
1769968	1770729	I totally admit.
1770809	1773270	Is this like Derby Owners Club for frogs?
1773530	1774410	Froggy Owners Club Froggy Owners Club
1797256	1799739	New show, E-Hoarder, starring Rob Roberts.
1800099	1800820	Seriously.
1801080	1806466	I had to remove a bunch of apps off of my iPod because I've actually maxed out the memory.
1806566	1808528	I had like 6.5 gigs worth of apps on there.
1809609	1814654	Of course, a lot of them were like those 100 or 400 gig apps like the Monkey Island games.
1815803	1818505	Multiple folks in chat are saying, so it's chocobo breeding.
1818545	1820286	Yeah, it's kind of like the chocobo breeding in a way.
1820766	1822047	Except you can't... But no racing.
1822468	1824349	Except you can't fly your chocobo over the mountains.
1824729	1824929	No.
1825329	1828592	And land in the giant crater so that you can get the materia.
1829072	1839399	There are pay parts to this game, and that is, like, if you want to use, like, a growth potion to make your frog egg grow instantly and not have to wait 30 minutes, you can pay, like, 99 cents, or you can get the mail to move fat.
1839419	1845423	Like, all this, like, impatient people bullshit, I can't believe anybody would spend money on, but I guess they're making money off it somehow.
1845823	1847024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1873403	1873983	It's cute!
1874444	1875044	And I bought shrivels.
1875684	1880387	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Rob, you basically defended all Farmville players all over the world.
1880787	1882368	No, because Farmville's lame.
1882828	1887751	Speaking of which, I am currently on dog-sitting duty for my mom's Farmville account.
1889252	1889652	Wait, wait.
1889852	1890933	You've got to explain this.
1890993	1891293	Hold on.
1891673	1893234	Is your mom like super addicted to Farmville?
1893254	1899898	My mom is super addicted to Farmville, Frontierville, that Treasure Island one, all that crap.
1900159	1906042	And she has this farm full of animals and she is insisting that I watch her dogs.
1906182	1908304	I have to feed her dogs because she's on vacation for a week.
1908324	1912387	I wonder if there's actually some sort of money to be made for a service like that.
1912427	1914968	You know what I mean?
1915048	1917390	Remember Neopets and how you could just put them in the kennel?
1918570	1919671	They should have something like that.
1919731	1920151	Seriously.
1921091	1922132	I think a couple of them do.
1922592	1923972	Hire the immigrant workers.
1925773	1927814	I wouldn't mind hiring some from a damn hotel.
1928594	1931215	I'm sorry, I don't play Hotel City or anything.
1931575	1935316	Ray Ayanami in our chatroom says, just shut down her accounts while she's gone.
1935917	1936917	It's an intervention.
1937137	1938778	Burn it to the ground!
1939018	1942039	I'd love to, but I would probably not have a mother after that.
1942959	1950401	and it would be like, you know, hey, this is Rob Roberts on CBS 13 and Jessica Harper was found dead this evening.
1951861	1953262	Strangled to death by her mother.
1953322	1958123	I shouldn't feel any pressure here, but she's like, if you don't feed them every single day, they're going to die.
1958523	1959523	They're going to run away.
1959883	1961764	They're not going to want to be part of my farm anymore.
1961784	1964465	I'm like, okay, mom, I'll feed your stupid dogs.
1964485	1965645	That sounds like my mother.
1967185	1971167	And she's on Facebook all the time saying, I didn't get my treat basket!
1971488	1972688	Where's my treat basket?
1975229	1977731	Except, you know, in much more of a southern accent.
1978211	1980252	Y'all, I can't find my treat basket!
1980811	1981391	DarkSakura.com
1997273	2006139	Yeah, I actually just posted something on Facebook a couple days ago that was, you know, the anti-parental tool for Facebook.
2006179	2007680	It was, you know, an SNL skit.
2008520	2010081	And I posted it up.
2010121	2011302	I'm like, so mom, do I need this?
2011342	2015865	And basically it's like talking about how, well, do you post things that your mom doesn't want to see?
2015905	2019647	And it shows pictures of like him smoking a bong and what have you.
2019667	2022869	And apparently this tool is supposed to make everything all better.
2022929	2025171	And it turns the bong into like a saxophone.
2025191	2025311	Yeah.
2026031	2030835	Drew and Sam drinking beer into like, I need to go buy some dungarees.
2031596	2035860	We'll have to find it later on on break or something so you guys can play it because it's pretty humorous.
2035920	2036440	We'll look for it.
2036601	2036901	Awesome.
2037121	2037361	Awesome.
2037842	2038082	All right.
2038102	2039343	Well, that's going to do it for my gaming week.
2039363	2041445	I don't want to talk about a whole lot of other stuff.
2041485	2043006	So let's get into some other stuff tonight.
2043387	2044007	Housekeeping.
2044187	2045328	Don't have a whole lot to add here.
2046009	2047370	Are we doing a show on Halloween?
2047931	2050113	That's one thing I've got to figure out.
2050173	2050793	I'd rather not.
2050813	2052695	I thought we were going to go to the Winchester Mystery House.
2055634	2056815	Well, I gotta work the next day.
2056835	2057597	That's not my problem.
2058217	2059980	Stupid words.
2060080	2060441	I don't know.
2061082	2065849	You should tell them that you celebrated a religious holiday and that you're exhausted from carousing.
2065989	2068813	Instead, it'll be boring in the dark.
2069775	2070315	Well, we'll see.
2070375	2070656	I don't know.
2070856	2072217	I love the Winchester Mystery House.
2072237	2074897	We will probably pre-tape, I'm going to imagine, that week.
2074977	2076138	So we'll work something out.
2076158	2077058	Does that sound right, guys?
2077078	2078039	We'll probably pre-tape that week.
2078059	2078899	Pre-tape sounds fine.
2078999	2080559	But we won't be here on Halloween night itself.
2080940	2082980	Otherwise, shows on schedule as usual.
2084321	2085761	And of course, follow us on Twitter.
2085801	2087162	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2087222	2088542	Speaking of, if you want to be like my mom.
2088782	2090323	My mom doesn't know about the OLR Twitter, I don't think.
2090723	2091884	and you can follow us on Facebook.
2091904	2095246	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2095266	2097187	I was going to mention one part of my gaming week.
2097227	2098107	I got a new laptop.
2099188	2099788	It's awesome.
2100128	2105051	It's an Asus G60JX which is just a Core i5
2106932	2107213	PC.
2107533	2108875	Core i5s are weird.
2109115	2117147	Actually, all those new core systems with the hypothetical threads and oh, we only overclock your system when it's not running hot and that kind of stuff.
2117908	2118189	Strange.
2118249	2120933	But hey, it runs Grand Theft Auto and that's all I really needed to do.
2121053	2122955	Does that complete your life?
2124131	2125771	It does, for now.
2126932	2133533	Our pal Bobby Blackwolf from before us here at Orange Lounge Radio says he will be doing a show because they don't get any trick-or-treaters where he's at.
2134633	2135733	I am the trick-or-treater.
2135813	2140134	That's why we're not having a show, but that's okay.
2140194	2142194	Bobby will be doing his marathon show on Halloween.
2142754	2146915	I've learned something about... Rob, since I've become a Jew, I've learned something about Halloween.
2147875	2150916	You go shopping for costumes after Halloween so you can use them for Purim.
2152496	2154578	I'm actually deciding between two costumes right now.
2154598	2157480	I'm sure you could use them for porn too.
2158280	2162743	I guess my Star Trek uniform would be good for sci-fi porn.
2163004	2166266	Seriously, we went to a party USA or whatever.
2166306	2167387	It's like this big old party store.
2167407	2168808	They have tons of costumes and stuff.
2169648	2171750	Or party city, whatever.
2171930	2175492	See, we wanted to get Josh a Darth Vader costume.
2175532	2176133	That would be great.
2176673	2177374	Darth Vader Darth Vader
2196806	2198247	Darth Tater, not bad.
2200347	2204209	No, but anyways, there was a wall of sexy costumes that they had.
2204669	2205309	For babies?
2205609	2206710	No, not for babies.
2207130	2211351	I'm going to get you a pedo bear costume.
2212412	2214232	Dude, that would be awesome.
2214272	2216133	They'd dress him up like pedo bear.
2218630	2219430	Optimus Prime
2248462	2249962	Sexy Optimus Prime.
2250162	2251743	I'm sorry, it's just weird.
2251963	2254023	I've seen Sexy Chewbacca recently.
2254444	2255904	Sexy Brian the Dog.
2256004	2258825	It's like, no, that does not need to be sexy.
2259345	2260245	Spongebob.
2260305	2261945	I mean, it's like, what?
2262525	2263106	Spongebob.
2263206	2264186	I mean, seriously.
2264566	2267667	I guess, you know... Spongebob no pants?
2268367	2270968	The demand for slutty costumes is great, I guess.
2272468	2275649	Maybe there's women that love Optimus Prime and love loose sex.
2275769	2275969	I mean...
2277476	2279418	New vibrator attachment for your transformer, Fox.
2279438	2282261	Only if she makes the wah-wah-wah-wah noise.
2283863	2286285	All right, chatroom, chat.orange.com.
2286345	2289348	TigerClaw says, Loki should dress his baby as Mario to match his bedroom.
2289568	2291350	You know, a toad costume would be cute, though.
2291370	2293092	That would be cute.
2293112	2297677	We've been thinking about that because he has the wonderful mushroom hat that my co-worker got him.
2297697	2298077	There you go.
2298497	2299058	The Starman
2325191	2326671	Oh, the little star.
2328672	2332793	Wasn't Maggie in an episode of The Simpsons dressed up as a star?
2333554	2334674	I didn't even remember that.
2335694	2338035	I used to love The Simpsons back when it was first on.
2338335	2346978	So that's the great thing about babies, because you can dress them in embarrassing outfits and they don't really understand until they're 18 and you get out the pictures.
2348010	2348590	I was thinking 10.
2350973	2355537	You've seen on Facebook where my mother posted pictures of me and my brothers in our old Howling costumes.
2355577	2356538	Oh yes, good times.
2356838	2357759	My brother was a Popple.
2359281	2360642	I sort of remember what a Popple is.
2360662	2361503	I've apparently remade a friend.
2361863	2362304	What were you?
2364686	2365607	Jane of the Jungle.
2366128	2368310	Because I was wearing that leopard print thing.
2369802	2372284	I want to dress up as a cheerleader from Glee
2398010	2426406	But then, hold on, hold on, hold on And so I can come out on stage and say Hey, I look for my Halloween costume I'm a cheerleader from Glee And then turn around and I'll have a bunch of bullet holes in my back And say, after the Rocky episode aired I would go for that Because normally, you know, I can't stay on the show Okay, then here's my other thing Is that my second choice is that I want to dress up as Allison from Intervention She was the girl that inhaled the computer duster It's like I'm walking on sunshine Ha ha ha
2427594	2428635	and I'm thinking of that too.
2428835	2429817	Would people get it though?
2430597	2433040	If I had the computer duster and said that a lot, I might.
2434021	2435203	I'm still taking submissions though.
2435243	2436004	I need some good ideas.
2436024	2437105	You could be Towley.
2437846	2438366	Towley?
2438707	2440469	Just get a big giant towel and put it over your head.
2441290	2443432	People might take that the wrong way and call me a racist.
2443512	2444213	I don't know about that.
2444313	2444773	Towley?
2444974	2445234	Yeah.
2445254	2446856	From South Park, right?
2447176	2447496	Yeah.
2447836	2449217	How would they call you a racist?
2449397	2449717	Forget it.
2449817	2451918	You don't have to roll it up into a cone for your head.
2451958	2455059	My original plan was to be Dr. Horrible, but that would have taken some time.
2455080	2455860	That's a good idea.
2455880	2456460	That would be fun.
2456720	2457140	I like that.
2457901	2458221	All right.
2459381	2462563	Jessica, before we get into some gaming news, which I know we've only been on the air about.
2462583	2463603	You can be sexy Optimus Prime.
2465584	2466925	Sexy Fat Optimist Prime.
2466945	2467545	That'll be fun.
2468405	2469206	My butt hanging out.
2469806	2473227	You never know, that might turn somebody on.
2474688	2475388	It won't be Alan.
2475668	2476729	It'll be like, what are you doing?
2477049	2478429	What, what, what are you doing?
2479570	2481030	I thought we'd gotten past all of this, Rob.
2482932	2484013	We're only 40 minutes into the show.
2484033	2485454	I haven't hit gaming news yet, but that's okay.
2485494	2487595	Let's ask Jessica some more DDR fun stuff.
2487955	2497622	How did you get from being a DDR fangirl, I can't pass boom boom dollar the first time, to I am an administrator on DDR Freak?
2497782	2498582	What happened?
2498803	2500504	I was a bitch.
2503105	2508089	No, actually, it was mostly Jamie's influence that kind of got me into the moderatorship.
2509009	2511731	We were all, of course, a part of DDR Freak forums.
2513152	2516696	Through my friendship with Jamie, she introduced me to a lot of the Bay Area people.
2517097	2519860	And Bay Area people talked with other Bay Area people.
2520360	2524245	And actually, humorously enough... So you were part of a clique?
2524725	2525526	Kind of, yeah.
2526127	2530492	But humorously enough, J-Dog did not want me as a moderator.
2531053	2531213	And...
2532494	2558215	Signing actually kind of went behind his back and just boop, here you go So I was given my moderatorship because of Jamie and Inouye The mod that was not meant to be, oh boy And I was introduced to Signing and just kind of became a mod from there And ever since, there was a period of time when J-Dog and I really did not get along at all because of it
2558915	2560556	He always felt that I shouldn't have been a mod.
2561096	2562577	She's not ready to be a mod yet.
2563238	2567580	I know we need more people from all over, but I don't think we need another Sacramento person.
2567860	2570222	Is there trials you have to go through to become a moderator?
2570282	2573043	No, you just need to be able to follow the rules.
2573564	2574644	Be a good babysitter.
2574904	2577106	You didn't have to kiss J-Dog or anything?
2577426	2578767	No.
2578807	2580067	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2580768	2582069	No, no kissing the co.
2582849	2585210	We did have a very epic trip to Las Vegas.
2585330	2587712	Yes, and we were stalked.
2588092	2588212	Yes.
2588232	2588612	Hold on, hold on.
2588632	2590433	I want to hear how she got from moderator to administrator.
2591173	2593274	Well, this is before that, but... Okay, okay.
2593434	2595415	All right, fine, fine.
2596355	2598496	But no, we'll skip, we'll come back.
2598516	2598936	Okay.
2600317	2606459	As for becoming administrator, it was kind of... I was helping out with a lot of the website stuff.
2606499	2608960	I was available a lot more than a lot of the people and...
2611361	2624230	Spike, who was the administrator at the time, he really was having a hard time keeping up with things and I had become an administrator because of my helping out type of stuff.
2624291	2637100	I was working on some of the web stuff, keeping things handled there, doing the DDR Freak Radio and making sure that certain people stayed banned and what have you.
2637840	2664717	and because of all that I got my administratorship and then Spike decided that he just couldn't dedicate enough time anymore and it was basically put to a little mini vote between like the other big wigs and I kind of became head administrator the girls at the Mean Girls head table or whatever so yeah I became the head bitch in charge and that's where I stayed for probably a couple years
2665290	2668572	What was the meanest thing you ever had to do?
2668732	2672055	Or I guess I should say the bitchiest thing you ever had to do as an administrator.
2672255	2672715	Oh, God.
2676798	2678940	Well, it's... Okay, here's another humorous story.
2679360	2681942	A lot of people remember Pyrofreeze.
2686125	2686365	Yes.
2686445	2690128	And that's the reaction that most people have when mentioning Pyrofreeze.
2691128	2693590	Yeah, he was a troll-a-da-la-lull.
2695291	2715485	to the extreme and we had to ban him and he would evade the ban and ban him again evade the ban ban him again and this just went on and on and on you know the unfortunate part is that he's very very smart when it comes to you know spoofing IPs and what have you really smart guy and he finally decided he was bored with it
2716105	2720427	Left over to DDREI for a while and then just kind of dropped off the face of the planet.
2721508	2727970	And then he came back and he kind of apologized to me for being such a troll for so long.
2727990	2729351	Like I grew up, basically?
2729391	2734573	Yeah, basically I grew up, I was in my early 20s and I was being a total jackass.
2734713	2742297	And we started talking and I started letting him stay on the forum a little bit more and...
2742657	2748980	and then he and I just kept getting closer and closer as friends and we ended up going to meet up in Las Vegas.
2749500	2756403	So I actually met one of our biggest trolls in Las Vegas and had a good time.
2756743	2757443	We gambled.
2757483	2758443	You didn't sleep with him, did you?
2760844	2767487	Wait, oh my god!
2767507	2768167	Just say no.
2768327	2769788	If you want to say no, just say no.
2769928	2770868	But he had a really big dick.
2775777	2777419	I would say you're complimentary shades.
2795817	2796838	Wow, okay!
2796858	2799199	You know what they say, Rob.
2799439	2803601	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
2804842	2806042	Oh, he was very close.
2806062	2808663	Yeah, but I'm thinking of the enemies I had back in the day.
2808723	2811625	No, no, no, no.
2812585	2813486	Not even close, no.
2814126	2814506	Just ew.
2815226	2819749	It was one of those situations where we were kind of flirtatious ahead of time and...
2821187	2825592	One Thing Led to Another, and yeah, stuff.
2827294	2829376	Wow, okay.
2829436	2832179	That was not the line of questioning I really... Whatever.
2833361	2836945	Well, you know, when the money runs out when you're gambling, what else is there to do in Vegas?
2839468	2842251	But we did come back with a cute story about how we got married.
2843311	2845853	We were married by Elvis and everything.
2846474	2846954	Wow.
2847674	2848655	Nothing came of it, of course.
2848695	2850876	It was just all in good fun.
2851537	2859382	It was my, hey, I'm free from debt, so let me put myself into a tiny bit more to start with again because I just got a new credit card.
2859602	2867908	But it is interesting, all joking and laughing and lols aside, it is interesting how people really do kind of grow up and mature and can really change.
2867928	2868028	100% did.
2868048	2868308	That's great.
2870329	2872110	He's an awesome guy and I wish him well.
2872150	2876953	I haven't even really talked to him for the past couple of years, but he's a cool guy.
2877794	2886459	I think I remember the truce happening because we started seeing him more and more on the forums and we talked about it too.
2887320	2894004	I actually remember posting something in the moderator forum saying, Hey guys, just back off him.
2894024	2895085	He's trying to be good.
2896005	2896426	Interesting.
2896466	2904133	Unlike other people who have been complete assholes on the forum who got banned and... Dan's raising his hand.
2904173	2906836	Yes, sweetie, I know that you're a complete asshole.
2906856	2908577	Not on the forums.
2909799	2911040	He says not on the forums.
2912048	2914711	Like a certain guy by the name of Jared.
2916372	2918875	And actually, I banned Tran.
2920216	2921297	Oh, yeah, Trampawa.
2922198	2922818	Good times.
2922899	2929405	I love how suddenly it's talked into talking about all the trolls of the DDR Freak Days and which ones of them Jessica has slept with and which ones she hasn't.
2929705	2932868	I have Kilroy on my friends list on Facebook now, which is kind of humorous.
2932888	2933809	This is funny.
2936511	2942735	If you are a web troll out there, just know if you turn over a new leaf, you might have some surprises in store.
2944657	2947939	Thanks, Rob.
2947999	2953983	Next time some damn story about Lolo or something gets brought up on Under Sedation Live, it'll be well-deserved.
2955423	2958165	I do have the caveat that this was at least six years ago.
2958445	2962408	I don't think that would apply to the newt.
2963482	2963742	All right.
2965483	2966023	Let's not go there.
2966043	2966704	I didn't say it.
2966764	2967644	I said it backwards.
2967904	2968085	Yes.
2968725	2968945	Hi.
2969445	2970346	Getting into gaming news.
2970806	2971847	Hey, yes, let's do it.
2971987	2973227	We're only like an hour into the show.
2973247	2974448	I haven't even touched on gaming news yet.
2974788	2975329	Loki!
2975409	2976209	Hey, no, it's okay.
2977070	2977690	Trust me, it was great.
2978070	2978790	All right.
2978991	2983193	Loki, put down the I-O-S and let's talk about gaming news.
2984332	2987955	You sure you don't want to talk about enemies that you've slept with or anything?
2988936	2990237	I don't know if I have any.
2992079	2995382	Definitely not of the online DDR Freak sort.
2995402	2995942	I buried mine.
2996943	2998965	I don't think I ever had enemies.
2999105	3001327	Actually, I didn't really post much on DDR Freak.
3001887	3002988	Oh, everybody was my enemy.
3003028	3004009	That's the other problem.
3006206	3020630	and now they're all close friends kidding so there's a new game from Valve that was announced Defense of the Ancients 2 and apparently it's going to be including all the 100 plus characters
3022831	3046976	and I guess that's from the original game and new social features and the game itself of course is kind of an action RTS and honestly I've never played it nor I have heard anything about it but I mean I remember the same thing with Team Fortress 2 it's like Team Fortress 2 what was Team Fortress 1 and well this is interesting then more and more comes out about it and
3047577	3049858	You know, if it's Valve making, I'm sure it's going to be awesome.
3050138	3055521	But unfortunately, I'll have to wait until 2011 to actually be able to play the game.
3056182	3061625	But I'm sure if they're making a sequel to it, it was probably insanely popular to begin with.
3061885	3064506	Well, yeah, Defense of the Ancients was a huge Warcraft 3 thing.
3064666	3065287	Yeah.
3065507	3066887	So that's pretty cool.
3067188	3067388	Yeah.
3067828	3068028	Huh.
3069129	3076913	Kind of an interesting story because, you know, since Warcraft has kind of gone the way of World of Warcraft, which is not an RTS...
3077393	3081996	You basically have StarCraft and you have your handful of other RTSs on the PC.
3083917	3091101	This is going to be, especially the fact that A, it's coming from Valve, it's a mod that tons and tons and tons of Warcraft players are very familiar with.
3091441	3095203	It's going to be very interesting to see how that translates into a spin-off game.
3095483	3098625	I bet it'll be very successful the way Team Fortress 2 was.
3099105	3099265	Oh yeah.
3099325	3099805	Absolutely.
3100526	3104687	Especially if they bundle it in an uber pack of games like they did, you know, with Team Fortress 2.
3104747	3113850	Well, I don't even think that's necessary, but just the support that they put towards their games, I mean, look at even Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2 or Team Fortress.
3113890	3121373	I mean, it's just so much damn support after the fact that, you know, they really keep up interest in the game long after it's come out.
3121833	3122433	XBOX360's GameRooms.com
3144045	3145526	is shutting their doors.
3145726	3147147	That's right, Chrome Studios.
3147187	3148508	They're located in Australia.
3149248	3150729	They are shutting down.
3150989	3152370	It's a done deal, unfortunately.
3152871	3157714	Sadly, this was sort of something you kind of saw coming because they've been scaling back for a while.
3158174	3160795	They closed some of their studios throughout Australia earlier in the year.
3161116	3165819	The remaining staff at the studios in Brisbane and Melbourne have been let go.
3166219	3169381	Both studios are closing their doors tomorrow morning, which would be today.
3170101	3172202	They're like, scale back, way back.
3172242	3173423	No, really, all the way back.
3174163	3175564	It's the future in Australia.
3175744	3181387	The sad thing is that they were Australia's largest development house, and so now they are gone.
3182628	3188230	Of course, there are some lingering questions as to what's going to happen to Game Room, because they were kind of the biggest things behind Game Room.
3188531	3192813	I promise you, just as many releases on Game Room now as there...
3193633	3195955	Yeah, they'll keep scaling it back to like one game a week.
3196175	3200079	Well, I mean, it should be said there are still games being released for Game Room.
3200099	3200579	There are?
3201019	3201460	Oh, yeah.
3201600	3205143	I mean, they've been pretty good about doing them every week.
3205663	3215152	I'm not going to say they're always good games or well-known, but actually, I believe I was looking at what was coming up next week, and let me look.
3215752	3216312	Real quick here.
3216332	3218333	There's actually a list available on Wikipedia.
3218773	3222814	So I don't know if I would say doom and gloom in the end of Game Room just yet, because they still have.
3223214	3228916	For October 13th, Game Pack 10 gets more releases that include Radar Lock.
3229056	3229796	Oh no, that was this week.
3229816	3230136	I'm sorry.
3230517	3231577	What was on deck for next week?
3233439	3233859	Oh, here we go.
3234200	3242689	Breakout on the Atari, Double Dunk on the Atari, and Jackal, the arcade game from Konami, which was a classic game of the week before.
3242789	3249297	So, I mean, they still have some, even though two of those releases are kind of, okay, whatever, you do still have a pretty good memorable title in there.
3249797	3257042	So, and that's going to be Game Pack 11, because I think that's the start of a new Game Pack, so I don't think you can say that Game Room's really dead.
3258003	3263026	Seeing as the Microsoft logo's on that, it would make sense to me that the assets will get transformed over to Microsoft.
3263387	3270211	That might ultimately be a good thing, because maybe Microsoft will give it to someone else and say, here, make this better.
3271192	3274034	Or they will say, we will now write this off.
3274354	3275855	So I don't know what's going to happen.
3275915	3278297	It's sort of on life support right now.
3278837	3280159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3296575	3302696	One of its other biggest drawbacks is no publishers besides Atari and Television and Konami seem to be on board.
3302756	3311318	If they could at least get a couple more publishers or some rights to some other games, even if it's like Commodore 64, computer games, they could really breathe some life back into this thing.
3311338	3313239	But it'll just depend on, do they want to?
3313599	3314459	Are the sales there?
3315059	3319160	But I mean, even if they're only selling like 50 copies of Jackal...
3320106	3320907	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3345806	3347789	I'm not saying it's a lot of work, Loki.
3347989	3352215	It doesn't take a 20-man team to do, but there is some work involved in it.
3354319	3355380	So it's not completely free.
3356582	3356842	Anyhow.
3358280	3366264	and Spazinator PSN in our chatroom at chat.arnstanzradio.com says, Game Room is one of my favorite games on my 360 and Defective Candy says, bah, I loved Game Room.
3366765	3371727	There's a lot I do still like about Game Room, you know, and I'm kind of sad to see that it might be done.
3372148	3379692	But I don't, you know, BlackWolf in chat says, even the games, quote, nobody plays has at least 400 people on the leaderboard.
3380192	3381313	So, you know, 400 times three, $1,200.
3381353	3382133	That's still something.
3386280	3389601	You said he was playing Intellivision Pinball, and that was one of them.
3390121	3390362	Wow.
3391162	3391682	Alright, anyhow.
3392022	3393623	And I agree with Ranma, we need Mercs.
3394423	3397644	Let's move on to some more gaming news, DarkSakura, and we'll see.
3397724	3400726	I don't think, I would not put the nail in the coffin of Game Room just yet.
3400806	3404427	It might be on life support, as Jamie said, but it's not flatlined yet.
3405287	3409609	Well, speaking in terms of games that have...
3410236	3416190	Previously been on their last legs that may or may not have a forever title attached to it coming out one day.
3417433	3418876	I'm still not holding my breath for the record.
3420410	3421611	It'll be this spring.
3422151	3423431	I'm not holding my breath.
3425252	3439778	At any rate, there is a non-commercial license out to go ahead and make the fan-made Duke Nukem Next Gen that is basically a remake of Duke Nukem 3D using the Unreal Engine.
3440818	3444099	And I watched some of the film of it and it looks sweet.
3445740	3446400	Duke Nukem 3D
3448141	3452466	I have to say was probably my... You know what?
3452506	3453747	I think I played this before I played Doom.
3455449	3455709	Really?
3456190	3459233	And it was also my first LAN game that I ever played.
3459754	3461516	Where you could do the little voice macros in it.
3462056	3462617	It was really great.
3462717	3462917	Anyway.
3464902	3479173	He was also working on next-gen remakes of Daikatana and Sin, but this one was given the green light, so he's going to make a multiplayer demo of it that should be out fairly soon.
3479954	3483837	And the full version will be out, he says, when it's done.
3485198	3486099	And it's just a code for him.
3486799	3490882	That's actually really cool the developers to do.
3491122	3491783	I'm surprised.
3491883	3494245	I'm very surprised that they're not trying to do it themselves.
3495125	3498107	I'm very surprised that they aren't going to put this on a console.
3498467	3503310	Seriously, an HD remake of Duke Nukem 3D would be fucking awesome.
3503430	3505991	It would be a little redundant because there's already Duke Nukem 3D.
3506011	3506952	Who cares though?
3507252	3508773	A little redundant.
3508813	3512475	You do all these HD versions of games and that's just making the sprites look prettier.
3512515	3514116	This is actually rebuilding the game.
3515416	3516137	It looks gorgeous.
3517140	3519462	Oh yeah, they definitely kind of rebuilt that first level in there.
3519522	3523264	And I know this doesn't translate well to radio, but you're kind of seeing... I'm going to link the video in the chat room.
3523284	3527827	You're kind of seeing a remake of that first level where you're on the rooftops and things kind of crash down.
3527867	3530508	You sort of see a remake of that here in this engine.
3531189	3531709	That's pretty cool.
3531889	3534030	And it moves very smoothly.
3535848	3536869	Kink's Quest Silver Lining Debacle
3556667	3559128	I think this is... I would play this.
3559748	3567332	And normally, first-person games like that, especially ones that are actually 3D models, make me really, really motion sick.
3568112	3568852	I would still play this.
3570293	3572534	This would probably be like my new portal.
3573817	3575618	It would be fun, especially with the multiplayer and everything.
3575638	3576059	But I don't know.
3576719	3585986	Some things I think we tend to see through the retro-colored glasses, a little play on the rose-colored glasses, retro-colored glasses, because I know when I played Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live, I was like, oh, this is cool.
3586046	3587547	And then I was like, oh, but I don't know.
3587567	3591671	It's just not the same as it was when I was 18 and in the college dorms.
3591691	3598276	Kind of like playing Atari now versus playing Atari when you were first... There's some games that never lose their charm in Atari.
3598596	3598816	To be...
3599416	3628637	you make a good point but I don't play it I don't play it as much as I used to when I was a kid but it's still kind of cool to have because like yeah sometimes I'll get bored and I'll just kind of go into game room I'm like oh let me just play Keystone Capers for a minute and then I'm done you know I don't stay up all night playing it like I used to when I was six and we would have you know people you know little sleepovers and whatever but you know it's still kind of cool to have anyhow all right moving on to some more gaming news release dates classic game of the week coming up in a little while as well but first Loki
3629178	3633040	Yes, Red Dead Redemption, of course, is getting its new expansion pack.
3633480	3640604	Coming out October 26th, The Undead Nightmare brings zombies into the wonderful game of Red Dead Redemption.
3641525	3654752	And that's all sorts of awesome by itself, but if you happen to, say, want to skip buying Red Dead Redemption and just want to get straight to the zombies, screw all this, you know...
3655933	3657734	That's going to be in stores, I guess It's a couple weeks actually
3682413	3682813	for $30.
3683934	3689138	And I believe that's only on Xbox 360, but it may very well be coming to both platforms.
3689238	3691579	But as of right now, I know it's coming to Xbox 360.
3693280	3693901	But that's cool.
3694681	3696282	Because zombies have to be in everything, right?
3696422	3697103	Hell yeah.
3697483	3698484	You have a zombie horse.
3698524	3699765	You can fight zombie bears.
3701294	3702254	with your zombie guns.
3704435	3705455	The guns are not living.
3705956	3708596	How well does the whole DLC in stores thing do?
3708656	3711597	I don't know if you have any insight to that from your distribution perspectives.
3711617	3712538	Does that actually do well?
3713198	3713898	This is different, though.
3713958	3715799	And yes, they do sell.
3716479	3717740	But this is separate.
3717780	3720781	You do not need the original game to play this.
3721541	3722301	I missed that.
3722341	3722581	Sorry.
3723161	3727583	It's just the online component only to the game.
3727683	3727863	Well...
3728403	3732225	You can technically play the free roam offline, but there's no storyline.
3732245	3734866	It's just, here's the world, go play.
3735727	3736147	That's it.
3736747	3737347	That's kind of neat.
3737968	3741069	A nice alternative, I guess, to those that maybe don't even want to play the single player.
3741729	3744311	Well, you really should play the single player because it's really awesome.
3744391	3747492	But, yeah, that's cool.
3747752	3757397	And I haven't really been buying any of the download content for Red Dead Redemption, but I may have to check this out because I do like me some zombies.
3758359	3760280	Beatmania 2DX Beatmania 2DX Beatmania 2DX
3781127	3782688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3801593	3808254	Well, being that it's been a year and no sign of Beatmania 2DX 17, which came out in arcades some time ago, and now what?
3808274	3811275	They've already announced 18 as well, so they're getting ahead.
3811775	3825617	Some Japanese fans actually took it up to create a petition saying, hey, we want Beatmania 2DX 17 series to come out for the consoles, either be PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 or what have you.
3825717	3830478	But see, that's the problem, though, is they have before it was just take the same engine,
3831158	3831739	Add new songs.
3832399	3832659	Done.
3833060	3833600	Reskin it.
3833700	3833981	Done.
3857340	3869827	Super Gay Unicorn Edition Yeah, that sounds like Always I wanna be with you Exactly I'd have to play that actually Yeah, see, see But only that song It has nothing to do with the game No, but
3871730	3877757	See, that's why I think the problem is right now they don't have a brand new piece of software to work off of.
3877777	3884865	They don't have anything made before, so they're trying to create something new in order for it to support B-Mania.
3885926	3889831	Really, they could just upskill stuff that they have, but whatever.
3890091	3899953	Well, regardless, some Japanese fans decided to get together and start this online petition, which started circulating its way on some of the big American sites like DemaniStyle and some of those as well.
3900333	3902394	It's, hey, you need to release this game over here.
3902974	3905854	What's interesting, though, you might go, oh, yeah, online petitions.
3905975	3908815	Yeah, you're going to have a lot of luck with those because those always do the trick.
3908855	3911376	Unless it's Betty White and Saturday Night Live, it's not going to happen.
3912296	3912476	Right?
3912876	3913676	I was part of that one.
3942524	3944725	And Konami actually responded to this.
3945185	3947226	Konami has written a little response.
3947326	3951727	They actually used the little Twitter tag thing, CS Serious or whatever.
3952347	3961010	They put, were another 2DX CS game to be released, would you like it to be on PS2, PS3, or another system?
3961570	3969753	This might tie in a little bit, too, and I think something that's not really touched on in this particular article I'm looking at, but I remember, on Naoki Midea's Facebook account,
3969853	3974176	He actually was asking, and he does a lot of the stuff in music games, he asked a very similar question.
3974316	3976838	He did like a little survey, like what systems do you play games on?
3977158	3978419	Do you want to see games on PS3?
3979119	3980260	What games do you want to see?
3980741	3988226	So Konami's kind of exploring this a little bit, and I think, I hope anyway, a lot of people responded to this saying, PS3, PS3, do it, do it, do it.
3989878	3990378	It was a great thing.
3990398	3993439	Hopefully it would be region free because PS3 is region free.
3993720	3998681	You wouldn't even have to worry about having to get a Japanese PlayStation 3.
3999182	4001002	I've got that pilot controllers in the vault.
4001022	4003283	But not all 360 games are region locked either though.
4008425	4012528	Orange Right in our chatroom says, is CS Sirius endorsed by President Cat?
4013288	4014109	Oh, President Cat.
4014149	4014529	I think so.
4014769	4020472	But remember, CS Sirius is coming from Japan and President Cat would be a US thing even though he could be like the world's president.
4020772	4024895	So I think there would need to be like Ambassador Puppy or something.
4025315	4026575	And President Cat's a girl.
4027636	4027956	All right.
4028617	4030638	Maybe that's why we didn't get President Cat over here.
4031078	4036481	And Black Wolf, our pal, is correcting us saying it was 15,000 pre-orders because he was one of them.
4038618	4040099	I knew a couple people that were in on that too.
4040459	4042840	So it'll be interesting to see if Konami kind of continues with this.
4043040	4043901	I think they will.
4044201	4046022	My gut tells me they'll do it.
4046602	4047302	And it'll be PS3.
4047402	4049023	We'll see.
4050204	4050844	And I'll probably buy it.
4050864	4054686	I think it'll be multi-platform because they're not going to put all their eggs in PS3.
4054946	4057287	Well, if it's Japan only, then yeah, it would be PS3.
4057688	4063230	But if it does come out over here, it'll be multi-platform because PS3 sales over here aren't.
4063270	4064411	I don't know if they'll bother with it.
4064871	4072456	I think what they're going to do is do it on PS3 for wide release in Japan and do a limited release on PS3 in the United States.
4073056	4073777	That would make sense.
4074177	4075618	That's what I see happening.
4075698	4079580	How many copies did they make of Beatmania when they brought it out over here?
4080621	4082902	Does Beatmania 2DX still use licensed music?
4083022	4085184	It's more about the controllers would be the biggest pain in the butt.
4086544	4087825	They've got controllers.
4089046	4091908	If they used the redone model for the controllers they really were a lot better.
4092768	4095870	Yeah, but now it's all USB on the PS3.
4095910	4101554	You have to have a converter, which either way you're looking at some type of peripheral to come with you.
4101574	4103596	I'm sure they could rework the controller.
4104336	4105797	They make them.
4105938	4111381	There's also those multi-converter things so you can use other controllers on different systems.
4111561	4114163	If they haven't been locked out by Sony.
4114263	4115224	Or just use your guitar.
4115384	4116505	Just play 2DX on your guitar.
4116805	4117105	Freaks.
4118006	4118867	Sorry, not guitar freaks.
4118927	4119407	Guitar hero.
4119747	4120448	Guitar or whatever.
4120768	4122088	Sitar Hero Sitar Hero
4150782	4158762	Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock sold 86,000 copies its first week in the US on all formats.
4161027	4162647	Yeah, here's the numbers for the other ones.
4163428	4163708	Okay.
4164188	4167629	Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 units.
4168929	4170989	Is that overall or in its first week?
4171009	4171449	First week.
4172050	4173110	Wow.
4173150	4174990	These are first months that I'm going through now.
4175330	4176631	This was just the first week, the 86,000.
4176931	4177171	Okay.
4177651	4180352	The rest of these are going to be... Okay.
4181172	4182832	Guitar Hero 5 sold 499,000 its first month in 2009.
4182872	4182952	Okay.
4186773	4190736	Guitar Hero World Tour sold 50,000 in its first week in 2008.
4191137	4196101	And Guitar Hero 3 sold 1.4 million units in five days.
4197182	4199604	Now, these are also going back in time.
4199964	4201545	We're talking 499,000 units in a month for Guitar Hero 5 in 2009.
4201625	4202766	And then in 2008, and before that in 2007.
4202806	4203947	They're talking about in its first month?
4204548	4204628	No.
4204668	4205248	Its first week.
4217321	4219282	Guitar Hero 5 was in its first month.
4220582	4225644	It sold just under as many units as Guitar Hero World Tour did in a week.
4226945	4227705	Oh, wow.
4227905	4228165	Okay.
4228645	4228846	Yeah.
4229646	4233507	And most of these games tend to sell in the first few weeks.
4233627	4240110	Although, couldn't you argue that Guitar Hero is going to have some lasting power through the holidays because it's a game that Grandma might buy the kids?
4241585	4242427	I don't know so much.
4242728	4249345	I mean, really, if it was going to draw in the business, the numbers would have stayed steady, I think.
4249747	4257149	No one cared about Guitar Hero this year, and the reason why is because they... No, not really, because a lot of people don't care about Rock Band 3 either.
4257309	4261349	It's just, they kind of have the mentality, oh, when music games are dead, genre is dead.
4261849	4262250	They're dumb.
4263030	4273572	Well, actually, going to say that, Harmonix actually had to convince people that the whole genre wasn't declining, so...
4275073	4280596	Basically, the CEO was saying, and I quote, I absolutely do not believe that rhythm action gaming has reached its peak.
4282277	4291143	But, eh, they're saying in the UK that Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock launched at 6 on the list and rated a 7 out of 10.
4291183	4293585	Well, here's the thing.
4293645	4296027	I think Guitar Hero's just getting stale to a lot of people.
4296067	4298488	I mean, what did this new game bring to the table?
4299109	4302131	They brought transforming characters.
4303444	4321825	We get a guitar and rock hand Here's why Guitar Hero 5 sold more than Guitar Hero Warriors Rock Guitar Hero 5 for the first month included Guitar Hero Van Halen for free The new Guitar Hero included a Soundgarden album
4323200	4328722	Who gives a crap about the Soundgarden album?
4329803	4339707	I'm a Van Hagar fan, so I would have picked Soundgarden over... But it was a game that people would be able to get their hands on months before it was released.
4339827	4341688	A $12 CD versus a $40 game, I get it.
4342088	4342909	But keep in mind... $60 game.
4344109	4344509	Oh god.
4344529	4345410	They charge full price.
4345430	4345950	Oh god.
4346671	4347251	Assholes.
4347471	4352374	Just as many copies sold in a week a year before and it didn't have a pack in a bonus game.
4352474	4359257	Might I remind everybody once again and I can't say Activision is the only culprit for this but
4360698	4375988	Wii versions of Guitar Hero, and Wii versions of Rock Band, and Wii versions of DJ Hero, and the Wii versions of the Tony Hawk Shred game that's coming out, all $60 retail.
4376789	4377089	Wow.
4377289	4380311	Despite the fact that most Wii games top out at $50.
4381212	4383974	Their excuse, oh, we need more money for music licensing.
4384714	4387036	Wait, wait, wait, why is Tony Hawk more expensive than that?
4389637	4391079	We want to pay the Deftones more money.
4391099	4393401	Because no one's going to buy it anyway, so whatever.
4394643	4393401	$1,000,000.
4394743	4396004	Bobby makes a good point in our chat room.
4396024	4402872	Blackwolf in chat.orangesoundtrader.com, live here on this Sunday night, says, Yeah, hey, music games are an oversaturated genre.
4402932	4405515	There are a total of four music games that came out this year.
4405995	4407377	And how many first-person shooters?
4408226	4408727	I know, right?
4409087	4412432	Or sports games, or, you know, just saying.
4413593	4425369	I think what it's going to come down, we'll have to see how Rock Band 3 does, because it's not, I mean, you can't really go off of Green Day Rock Band, because I knew that was going to be terrible when it first came out, or when it was first announced.
4425589	4453492	and the Beatles rock band was awesome but both are niche even though the Beatles is like a big niche and Green Day is a smaller niche they're both a little too they're niche and that limits the audience I think Rock Band 3 is going to be pretty incredible but I don't think it's going to be as big of a jump as Rock Band 1 to Rock Band 2 because a lot of people are like why do I need the upgrade because I have all these thousands of songs already with download content do I really need 80 songs
4454893	4455754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4479309	4483972	Guitar Hero, the new things it brought to the table were almost all single player things.
4484552	4488194	But Rock Band 3 is bringing more things to the multiplayer experience.
4488635	4490175	A fast story mode.
4490676	4491916	A new keyboard.
4492737	4495218	These new ways of dropping in and out really quick.
4495318	4497260	Everything it's bringing to the table is for the party.
4497480	4499301	And a new pro mode type thing.
4500462	4501902	Some people may be interested in that.
4502163	4504244	With at least the drums and the keyboards that Mike...
4504744	4505405	DarkSakura.com
4521745	4523226	TigerClaw in our chatroom has a good point.
4523366	4527949	Rock Band 3 is going to raise the bar because of its peripherals can be used as real instruments.
4528289	4530331	Guitar Hero will soon follow with their own version.
4530371	4531291	That's a darn good point.
4531311	4532212	We didn't even address that.
4533012	4538496	One thing that Rock Band has that Guitar Hero is not going to have is this whole learn to actually play or the pro mode.
4539116	4540177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4556733	4557353	for these songs.
4557393	4557994	That's awesome.
4558254	4560475	Someone like Bobby could probably appreciate this.
4560535	4568898	They also have the MIDI controller that you can buy for your MIDI-enabled instruments and just drop that in straight to the game.
4568918	4570579	Doesn't he have a full MIDI drum set?
4571219	4571820	I believe he does.
4572360	4573260	And probably a keyboard.
4573380	4575981	He's a huge drummer guy.
4576381	4578142	He makes money off some of that stuff, so I imagine he does.
4578182	4579243	He'll say in chat in a minute, I'm sure.
4580765	4581005	I know, right?
4581025	4585692	Let's go travel around the world and take a look at some release dates and things coming to a store near you.
4598357	4600258	DJ Hero 2 is coming out this week.
4600278	4602118	That's going to be on all three major systems.
4603218	4607239	I guess I'll have to wait until the 3DS version comes out for the portable DJ Hero.
4608300	4610380	That's kind of cool.
4622223	4636514	and then of course they're going to be re-releasing the first DJ Hero game in case you want to buy the standalone thing and then they have the bundles with the controllers the bundles with two controllers and a microphone because you need two turntables and a microphone so
4638636	4639537	That's all fun stuff.
4640657	4646742	Other slightly more boring stuff, Salter Overload Plus, delayed from last week, still hasn't come out, still don't care.
4647642	4650864	Kirby's Epic Yarn, that came out today, so that's pretty exciting.
4654867	4657769	Farmtopia on the DS.
4657829	4659410	It's a farm sim.
4659631	4661572	Awesome.
4662993	4664194	My First Dollhouse.
4666055	4669177	Not picking that one up, but that's on the DS as well.
4669698	4670538	I Love Puppies.
4670878	4672059	That's also on DS.
4674081	4675682	Other fun things coming out.
4677643	4682045	Zuzu Pets, KungZoo also held over from I think last week.
4683866	4685407	That's on DS.
4686827	4688928	And also those new Tron controllers that glow.
4688989	4690409	Those are coming out this week.
4690489	4691070	Want!
4691690	4692890	Need, want, have to have.
4694191	4695692	I totally want that keyboard and mouse set.
4695872	4699954	Can I just say a tangent because I want to do that whole like, I got something special.
4700254	4701935	I got tickets to that Tron night thing.
4702655	4704616	And I just realized yesterday that
4705345	4707227	Same day as my friend's birthday.
4708488	4712290	That if I don't go to whatever birthday shenanigans she plans, I will be murdered.
4713091	4713872	So, yeah.
4714112	4715233	So I don't know if I'm going to be able to go now.
4715533	4716093	Sad panda.
4717034	4719736	And no, taking her to Tron Night's not an option.
4719756	4721237	That's not something she'd want to do.
4721898	4723479	Sorry, Loki.
4723979	4725681	Another holdover from last week.
4727022	4730144	Shred featuring the Jamaican bobsled team on the Wii.
4730164	4730304	What?
4730945	4731145	What?
4732182	4735145	Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, I remember you mentioning that last week and I made fun of it.
4735165	4737327	That's why I said it was a holdover from last week.
4737467	4740629	Sorry, I was... As was the Wii inflatable racing cart.
4740790	4741790	Yeah, Rob, pay attention.
4742171	4744873	Sorry, I was reading our chat room and looking at Bobby's pictures.
4744893	4746274	I want the inflatable racing cart.
4747876	4748897	We should put Shermie in it.
4749077	4756063	And the best part about that Wii inflatable racing cart, much like the inflatable raft, I'm sure that could be used in a pool as well.
4759199	4764461	Naruto, Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 EA Sports MMA Fallout New Vegas I've heard of that game
4778891	4780953	Yes, I hear it's popular.
4781273	4785736	I hear Fallout is a little cult franchise.
4786437	4787658	I hear it's a very artsy game.
4788898	4793142	Arcanium Gothic 4 on Xbox 360 out this week.
4793862	4795303	Imagine Resort Owner.
4795543	4796784	Imagine I Don't Care.
4797065	4798005	That's on DS.
4798746	4800227	And hands for the DSi, by the way.
4800847	4803830	Active Life Explorer.
4804030	4805511	That's Namco's
4807492	4811597	Kevin Van Dam Fishing Blazing Souls Accolade
4827696	4831181	Sesame Street, Elmo's A to Zoo Adventure Did you say Sesame Street?
4831441	4838971	No, I said Sesame Street I want to go to Sesame Street Listen, bird!
4842535	4845579	You know, I had these DVDs I brought home for Nelly.
4845619	4847761	It was Sesame's Shalom.
4848842	4849463	I want to see that.
4849543	4852005	They're Jewish.
4852246	4854248	I've seen pictures of them.
4854288	4854989	I've wanted to see those.
4856650	4857872	She's like, this is stupid.
4857892	4859273	I'm like, okay.
4860114	4875963	CSI Fatal Conspiracy on Wii I believe that's PlayStation 3 and 360 Saw 2 Flesh and Blood on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week Oh god that's right I forgot that we were making a sequel to the Saw game
4876923	4906270	Bakugan, Defenders of the Core on the Wii and Playstation 2, Playstation 3, 360 and DS and PSP I believe Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 11 on that's lots of stuff this week DS, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and then of course they're going to have bundles for all that stuff they're actually making a wireless shotgun for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 which is kind of neat I suppose um
4908334	4909195	What other fun stuff?
4909235	4912378	Brunswick Cosmic Bowling with a bowling ball.
4912718	4913078	That's right.
4913098	4915240	I mentioned that last week and that's still a bad idea.
4916041	4920765	Rock of the Dead on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
4921285	4924408	Might be just the 360 version because I thought PlayStation 3 got delayed.
4924588	4926629	Smart Girls Playhouse Party Smart Girls Playhouse Party
4953719	4959362	Sesame Street's Cookies Counting Carnival on the Wii and DS and PC.

4973070	4974831	Flips Twisted World on the Wii.
4977544	4980066	Um... Holy crap, that's expensive.
4981428	4990196	For the PlayStation 3 to get geared up for Grand Theft Auto V, apparently Thrustmaster has a really expensive steering wheel that you can get for $250.
4990497	4994421	Called the Ferrari Wireless GT Cockpit 430.
4994701	4996322	Thrustmaster.
4997243	4998905	Scuderia Edition.
4998985	4999506	Thrust it!
4999806	5000286	Thrust it!
5001507	5002008	Thank you.
5002128	5003249	That's what I was getting at.
5004609	5005750	Were you listening last night?
5006311	5008252	Because I brought that exact same thing up.
5008272	5008612	Really?
5008852	5009032	No.
5009052	5010573	I was like, oh my God, the Boppagon.
5011014	5016657	There's only so many times you can say pull it and whack it before somebody's going to wonder why this is a G show.
5016878	5023842	No, I admit I was at the wedding reception and I probably wouldn't have even gotten signal to run the all games app on my phone to listen.
5024102	5026644	I had a good conversation about that last night on the show.
5026724	5030887	Well, if you ever update your podcast feed, DJ Morpheus, just saying.
5032147	5035949	Vanquish, the new game from Platinum Games is out this week.

5039870	5042270	That's on PlayStation 3 and 360 this week.
5042631	5046212	Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Tag Team on PSP.
5046972	5049152	Holy crap, there's a lot of stuff.
5050693	5053674	Time Crisis Raising Storm on PlayStation 3.
5054414	5057215	This is the second game you can use your GunCon 3.
5057655	5058355	Woohoo!
5058515	5058995	GunCon 3.
5059095	5059136	Um...

5094058	5095379	Lots of junk.
5097781	5100283	Is that your professional assessment as a video game analyst?
5100463	5102044	Crap, crap, and more crap.
5102164	5103485	Super analyst, okay?
5104406	5105346	I mean, God.
5105426	5107688	It's totally making me think of Madeline Kahn.
5108288	5109910	No, no, no, no, no, no, yes.
5109990	5110190	Okay.
5112091	5113231	Can I go to Japanese release dates?
5113251	5113832	No, you can't.
5113872	5115072	We're not done yet.
5115332	5117813	Bring a book to this show.
5118473	5121534	I'm going to girlcott your list, Loki, so we can move on to Bob.
5122334	5124835	No, we're almost done.
5125496	5126976	Sean White skateboarding.
5127756	5128877	That's the last thing coming out.
5128897	5129997	That's a week from today.
5131398	5134539	That is on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
5134859	5135559	I am done.
5136359	5137500	I love Bobby.
5137600	5138340	Bobby's so great.
5139803	5141684	He said, thank you for that clarification.
5142524	5143985	I was like, wait, did I say that?
5145365	5147686	Alright, let's move on to Japanese release dates.
5148346	5150747	Xbox 360 in Japan!
5150807	5163152	We have FIFA Soccer 11, Medal of Honor, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, RUSE, and Vanquish all come out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
5163192	5163672	That's on the 21st.
5163712	5165253	It's not RUS.
5167114	5167934	Rats of Unusual Size.
5169441	5170482	on the PlayStation 3.
5171403	5177167	We have Big 3 Gun Shooting, which I'm sure is the same as one of those games that Loki just named with the gun gone.
5177608	5185354	Beat Sketch comes out this week, as well as FIFA Soccer 11, Kung Fu Rider, Me and My Pet, which I think is the what?
5186014	5186534	Connectable?
5186555	5187335	That's iPet.
5187635	5188036	iPet.
5188556	5189456	Not on the Sony system.
5190197	5198940	Medal of Honor, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, and the PlayStation Eye and the Move and the Resident Evil 5 pack are all this week in Japan.
5199040	5201041	It'd be better if it was me and my penthouse pet.
5202201	5206323	RUSE, Sports Champion, and Vanquish all also on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
5206363	5208924	So I guess we're getting into a very busy week in Japan as well.
5209224	5212346	Just so you know, is this game in the US, BeatSketch?
5212646	5213687	I don't know this one.
5213947	5218550	No, I thought that was coming out only on the PlayStation Network here.
5218891	5221432	Interesting, because they are releasing it as a title on the PlayStation 3.
5221712	5226476	It is a move game where it looks like you kind of draw and little patterns sort of come out.
5226536	5229177	You sketch the different PlayStation shapes or whatever.
5229518	5231579	And I'm assuming it kind of makes music.
5232139	5234821	And you can see this lovely little girl here drawing flowers.
5235462	5238003	And I'm assuming it's music because you see a little counter in the corner.
5238023	5239084	So it looks like it might be kind of neat.
5239324	5240085	That looks kind of fun.
5240165	5243086	Could you imagine though playing like Oendon with something like that?
5244387	5246268	If they ever brought Oendon out on the Wii.
5246609	5249931	Is there a music game you'd like to see on PlayStation Move?
5250091	5251131	I want Space Channel 5.
5251171	5251872	I'm not even going to lie.
5251912	5252953	That would be fantastic.
5254393	5258376	I was trying to think whether... It has to have a special controller that looks like Ulala's mic.
5258536	5264420	Just so you know, here's a preview here real quick in studio for this beat sketch.
5264440	5266301	And I'll post this YouTube to our chat room as well.
5272542	5274845	It looks like Mario Paint, but happier or something.
5274865	5283277	I don't know.
5283297	5284458	People are drawing on the screen.
5287943	5289325	Some really intricate artwork, though.
5294822	5296243	Hmm, interesting.
5296263	5296703	It's cute.
5296884	5298105	Yeah, it looks like it could be neat.
5298145	5299086	So I'm going to post that on YouTube.
5299126	5300347	It's a clever little commercial.
5300367	5301908	It doesn't really say much about the game.
5302469	5307934	Yeah, if you want to see that YouTube, we were just playing Famitsu Tube is the link there.
5308475	5310157	I'm assuming that must be part of Famitsu Magazine.
5310277	5310537	There you go.
5311207	5321276	I was going to say there is the new Dance Dance Revolution game that will be coming out that actually utilizes the PlayStation Move to do all sorts of weird para type stuff.
5321296	5322277	This week here in the U.S.
5322357	5323418	or is that soon?
5323718	5324979	No, it's next month.
5325240	5326040	About a month from now.
5326861	5327181	You know what?
5327241	5328483	I could just hook up the pink biscuits.
5329343	5332006	Going to the Japanese release dates on the Nintendo Wii.
5333425	5337029	Mina de Bukken, Family Trainer, comes out this week in Japan.
5337369	5338950	I don't know what this game is.
5339211	5345236	It's a sports game of some sort, but it looks like cute little Indiana Jones-y family characters.
5345316	5348499	In fact, even on the cover, they have a family dressed up as Indiana Jones.
5348920	5353864	It looks like a newer version of the Power Pad that two people use at once, is what it looks like.
5354945	5355866	Thank you for watching!
5374046	5387711	No More Heroes 2 Desperate Struggle comes out this week in Japan and the Super Mario Collection Special Pack which we've talked about earlier on the show the whole if you want to pay a lot of money for an old Super Mario All-Stars game that they could have brought their virtual console because they don't release anything on virtual console anymore are you done?
5388671	5398034	on the Nintendo DS Strike Witches 2 Yasu Nasu Puni Puni Suru comes out this week on the Nintendo DS what game is that?
5398674	5399995	I don't know Strike Witches 2
5400895	5430210	yeah it's a cute oh it's dang these characters are huge it looks like like Contra with chicks wearing bunny ears and school uniforms with skirts that are way too short and there's kind of a sensual massage between two chicks going on right there there's no such thing as skirts that are way too short just saying lastly on the PS can I do mine can I do mine can I do mine PSP real quick I promise FIFA Soccer 11 Beyblade Portable Slaughter Mania P okay now you can do yours

5440439	5441579	Well, it's already today.
5441920	5442680	It's the future there.
5442760	5443161	I forgot.
5444141	5447004	The 17th, The Political Machine on PC.
5447564	5451847	On the 20th is Costume Quest, Super Meat Boy.

5456071	5461355	On the 22nd, EA Sports MMA and Fallout New Vegas, which is going to be hot.
5462476	5467779	We also have Monopoly Streets and NBA Jam and Vanquish and Vanquish.
5469761	5470741	And no more Vanquish.
5472102	5472943	And no more mic cord.
5474384	5475344	Did it cut out again?
5476325	5477306	Yeah, we have dead air right now.
5479187	5479487	You alright?
5480348	5481108	Do we have dead air now?
5481208	5481649	No, you're good.
5481869	5483430	Okay, do you want me to read my list again?
5483690	5487593	No, no, we just didn't get the Vanquish, Vanquish and more Vanquish part that you said.
5487613	5487693	Okay.
5487984	5488624	Deathspank Deathspank
5510555	5512237	Sadface, Wyndon is awesome.
5512378	5521430	I don't know about that, because I think that the new Dance Dance Revolution game has some fruity little mode in it that's, you know, with the stupid move controllers and...
5523058	5526599	I'm sorry, I can't take Konami seriously anymore with their dancing games.
5526679	5531540	I mean, just with Dance Master, you're going to really look... You can learn how to dance with this game.
5531780	5536061	No, you're going to look like a fool if you try to do what they do in that game in real life.
5536081	5538622	But Parapara was awesome because you looked like a fool.
5538702	5539142	Am I right?
5539162	5539842	Don't get me wrong.
5540023	5541723	Jessica, didn't you love the Parapara?
5542245	5543767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5565345	5565925	I mean, come on.
5566506	5567706	I'm not taking it seriously.
5567746	5571068	I'm not going, hey, this is an awesome new dance franchise from Konami.
5571588	5576231	I just see this as, oh my god, this pile of shit is going to be stinking up my room.
5576691	5579352	But I'm going to check it out for the sake of the show.
5579452	5580913	Taking one for the team, if you will.
5582734	5584435	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
5584755	5586936	The Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.
5587526	5595730	Yes, with Halloween right around the corner, apparently Sony is allowing you to download some free movies.
5596650	5600292	You can check out some free midnight movie rentals on your PlayStation 3.
5600352	5604454	They are available for a very select period of time.
5604474	5607696	In fact, this weekend they had Bram Stoker's Dracula.
5608096	5609677	That was available from 5 p.m.
5609977	5611418	on the 16th through 3 a.m.
5611478	5611678	on the 17th.
5612618	5616760	Next week, they're going to have Savage County, same time frame, 5 p.m.
5616880	5618741	on October 23rd to 3 a.m.
5618841	5620201	on October 24th.
5620961	5625423	And also, of course, Nightmare on Elm Street, the original one.
5626464	5631505	That's going to be available on Halloween from 5 p.m.
5631786	5633906	on October 30th to 3 a.m.
5634046	5634667	on October 31st.
5635902	5636563	What is she doing nowadays?
5636583	5636983	I mean, she needs...
5665524	5666764	Dude, that would be awesome.
5666805	5669465	They should have some sort of hosted stuff.
5670186	5671806	Sadly, I could actually tell you.
5671906	5676368	She's in a new movie called All About Evil, but she's actually Cassandra Peterson.
5676448	5682890	Her normal self is in this movie All About Evil that's directed by Peaches Christ, who is a drag queen in San Francisco.
5682970	5686452	It's like a... Al and I kind of want to go see it.
5686472	5687492	That's kind of something cool.
5687712	5691453	They should do that, though, for like, say, instead of this...
5693414	5694615	What was it?
5694795	5696237	Here, download a movie for free.
5696577	5698819	Put a little work into it to make it awesome.
5698959	5701922	Well, not necessarily that, but actually have it where you can watch a movie.
5701942	5703884	You know how they have it where you can watch a movie with friends and stuff?
5703904	5705065	But do it like 1 vs. 100.
5705265	5707267	Have a theater full of people.
5707287	5709309	Have it hosted by Elvira or something like that.
5709329	5712132	Mystery science theater type of thing or riff tracks.
5712152	5714854	The last Elvira experience I had was playing pinball.
5715995	5718997	But then you can even chat to friends and stuff like that.
5719117	5719558	Yeah.
5720258	5723040	Or here is a novel concept, Sony.
5723140	5728184	I'm going to give you some consulting advice for free.
5728564	5733587	Here is how to just make people interested in shit they were never interested in before on Sony.
5734528	5736689	Do it all in Sony Home.
5737570	5752217	Play the movie in the theater on Sony Home and everybody could actually be in the theater and you could have a live host up on the stage being a dork and doing the whole riff tracks thing and it's something new and kind of cool.
5754682	5758043	And then pay Orange Lounge $5,000 for the idea.
5758063	5759344	I gave that to Sony for free.
5760124	5761925	But we wanted money anyway.
5764506	5766567	You can put me in Sony Home for that free advice.
5766587	5766927	There you go.
5767873	5772636	Seriously, I'm surprised that they haven't done something like that Rocky Horror Picture Show with, you know... Rob can have no neck.
5772996	5776339	Frisbee in the chatroom says, throw virtual popcorn at the screen.
5777139	5778220	Amazing idea.
5778300	5783383	Your avatars could... Yeah.
5783563	5785845	I'm just trying to picture the time warp.
5787286	5793930	I could just see some total asshats, though, that would just sit there the whole time flailing around on their move and just popcorns flying everywhere.
5794872	5795854	The entire movie.
5796195	5796836	That's fine.
5796856	5800344	But, like, you get points for hitting your props at the right cue.
5801246	5804073	Like, you press A for, you know, squirt gun.
5805369	5807250	Let's see, going to some comments from the chatroom.
5807270	5812771	TigerClaw was saying Elvira needs her own video game and he actually did follow up saying, you know what, there really was an Elvira game.
5812791	5814032	I don't know if it's the same one he linked.
5814072	5820114	I'm not even going to look because I do remember an older PC game and I think there was even one on like the Commodore 64, like really that old.
5820414	5826056	But there was an Elvira video game that was kind of like an adventure game and it actually had like, there was like gore in it and stuff.
5826096	5829077	It was a very kind of like, from what I remember, it was a very kind of gory-ish game.
5829097	5829837	I think this is it.
5830878	5834720	Telltale Games, we have a new franchise for you.
5835000	5836241	Actually, that's very cool.
5836321	5837082	I like that idea.
5837682	5844187	There were, I think, three Elvira pinball tables.
5844787	5847769	There were three, I believe, Elvira pinball tables.
5848290	5854734	Defective Candy in our chatroom says, that virtual popcorn idea they use in Gaia Online and they are total asshats at it.
5854814	5855955	And yes, I used to play Gaia.
5856536	5856556	I
5859159	5861180	You can actually... Okay.
5862061	5862922	I used to play Gaia.
5863142	5864182	My account is still active.
5864322	5867505	And yes, you can go buy stuff from the little vendor to throw at the screen.
5868385	5868745	Good times.
5869446	5873608	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, would you host a Rocky Horror Night in home or in the OLR house?
5874089	5874809	Absolutely.
5875750	5878732	Sony, call me or whatever.
5878772	5879392	It'll be fun.
5879552	5880013	Why not?
5880113	5884435	I will whore myself out for the sake of publicizing this show and the All Games Network, of course.
5885676	5888078	I would even do it for free the first time.
5888098	5888478	Okay.
5890441	5891702	You get a freebie the first time.
5891722	5893684	The rest of the time you have to pay for his whore mouth.
5893844	5898268	That's right.
5899970	5900690	Okay, anyhow.
5901651	5904134	It's a cool idea that hopefully will get cooler.
5905692	5910156	Anyhow, let's talk about something that... Okay, your boyfriend gets kudos for me.
5910376	5910997	Why, what'd he do?
5911217	5913579	For saying that Scared Stiff was the best of the Elvira table.
5913599	5914940	Oh, he loves the Elvira pinball game.
5915240	5915961	Oh, it's so great.
5916141	5917703	Oh yeah, there's several of them.
5917903	5918283	There's three.
5919024	5925089	There was another one that had a two-layer playfield that was really cool.
5925209	5925629	Good times.
5925990	5927871	You know what Pinball FX 2 needs?
5928192	5928812	Elvira table.
5929112	5929693	Elvira table.
5930782	5932943	But the only problem with Elvira is she's getting kind of old.
5933563	5934464	Elvira.
5936165	5937546	That Elvira is probably dead.
5945928	5950772	I like how we're all laughing at this and poor Loki's looking at us like, you people are weird.
5950792	5956137	But see, with the magic of technology now, we can have old Elvira and new Elvira.
5956157	5968228	Well, I don't know if you know, but they actually did a reality show on SyFy Network that was The Next Elvira, where they were trying to cast the next Elvira, and some girl won, but they didn't do anything with it.
5969068	5969549	There's still...
5970109	5998739	Old Elvira Sorry you loser, there is no replacement for Elvira Thank you for trying As long as there's plastic surgery and makeup we'll always have our Elvira That's right Okay, let me move on here to Blizzard and some stuff going on at Blizzard and StarCraft 2, this isn't about WoW although I will say, the Cataclysm cinematic is now online and it had its little preview during the NFL game tonight and the full one is online and it is epic epicness If you are a WoW player
5998999	6002501	You get to see the Thousand Needles being flooded.
6002801	6006902	You get to see Deathwing landing on Stormwind and putting his claws into the castle.
6007183	6014106	And you get to see Ashenvale and any Alliance player will love this because you get to see Ashenvale get just destroyed.
6014646	6015986	I'm sorry, not Ashenvale, Aberdeen.
6016146	6017447	You get to see Aberdeen get destroyed.
6017567	6018527	I'm a bad WoW player, sorry.
6018928	6020448	Aberdeen just gets destroyed in the trailer.
6020468	6020768	It's great.
6020968	6022329	Isn't that where they keep cows?
6023810	6024370	Aberdeen?
6024850	6026731	Why do you always have to beat up the cows?
6027071	6028213	No, I wasn't beating up the cows.
6028233	6029695	To be fair, there are no cows in Aberdeen.
6029735	6030196	She's crazy.
6030697	6032980	No, that's where the Angus cows come from.
6033862	6034362	Not in the game.
6035464	6037467	All the cows are in Elwynn Forest.
6037487	6040172	Is this spelled like actual Aberdeen?
6040192	6041013	Forest cows?
6041053	6042054	That's ridiculous.
6043809	6044970	It's a video game, people.
6045270	6045631	Alright.
6046812	6048813	You just kept making me think of Scotland.
6049034	6049254	I know.
6049534	6052016	Let me move on to StarCraft 2 news because that's what this is really about.
6052457	6053257	It's about StarCraft 2.
6053778	6056801	Blizzard is actually going to be suing the cheat makers.
6057801	6062085	5,000 people were busted previously by Blizzard for cheating in StarCraft 2.
6063106	6066789	Well, Blizzard is actually going to take the people who made the cheats to court.
6067090	6069592	They are taking three men to court for making those hacks.
6072094	6085125	Just days after the release of Starcraft 2, defendants already had developed, marketed, and distributed to the public a variety of hacks and cheats designed to modify and in fact destroy the Starcraft 2 online gaming experience, says this lawsuit.
6085706	6094694	In fact, on the very day that Starcraft 2 was released, representatives of the hack's website advised members of the public that our staff is already planning on new releases for the game.
6095234	6099961	The accused are being accused of multiple counts of copyright infringement.
6100261	6105689	Blizzard wants damages and a cut of the money that the three received from selling the hacks.
6106350	6108373	That was your problem.
6108713	6110135	Two of these people are from Canada.
6110636	6111757	One of them is from Peru.
6112398	6132114	Blame Peru It doesn't have the same ring to it It doesn't have the same ring to it, I'm sorry to say that So we'll see what happens with this Probably be a settlement and these guys will get sued to oblivion, we'll see Although the international part of it makes it very interesting Blizzard is also warning people who want to cheat with StarCraft Use these trainers at your own risk
6133915	6138960	This is because Blizzard suspended some accounts because some folks have been exploiting.
6139480	6146767	And there was a guy on this website, Cheat Happens, that was reporting that they were banned from using a trainer in single player.
6147108	6148549	See, I have a problem with that.
6148609	6151352	Because if you want to cheat in a single player game, who are you hurting?
6152392	6153093	Well, here's the thing.
6153133	6155255	Blizzard did want to clarify on what's going on here.
6155695	6160999	Blizzard Entertainment is not banning StarCraft 2 players just for using single-player cheats.
6161840	6167424	There's been some confusion in the last couple days about the suspensions and bans meted out to players caught cheating in StarCraft 2.
6168024	6175788	It's important to point out first that many of the third-party hacks and cheats developed for Starcraft 2 contain both single and multiplayer functionality.
6176148	6184572	In order to protect the integrity of multiplayer competition, we are actively detecting cheat programs used in multiplayer modes, whether they are human opponents or not.
6185052	6190135	That said, players who opt to use any type of third-party hacks do so at their own risk.
6190555	6194797	There are built-in cheat codes for Starcraft 2 single-player that can be used safely.
6195217	6200159	Blizzard has always taken cheating seriously and will continue to aggressively crack down on players who cheat in our games.
6200579	6218446	Keep in mind, Blizzard also has an achievement system that even works in single player and I imagine these cheat codes disable those and they probably don't like the idea of these other exploits making the achievements easier to get because it gives the wrong perception as to what kind of skills someone has on StarCraft.
6219956	6220776	Something to keep in mind.
6221077	6226979	So after hearing that, does that change your mind, Loki, that Blizzard doesn't really want to ban the single-player cheaters?
6227039	6229500	It's just the fact that most of them are multiplayers as well?
6230280	6231141	They'll find ways around it.
6233462	6235022	They always do one way or another, don't they?
6236023	6236303	All right.
6236943	6245867	Let's take a trip down memory lane to another time when folks weren't banned en masse by cheating on video games and talk about the classic video game of the week.
6249437	6260602	DarkSakura is going to take a stroll to the vault and pull out an old dusty moldy video game that she says, hey, you brats, you need to respect this video game or die.
6261682	6263003	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
6263308	6272474	The game of the week is Ikari Warriors, which was also known as Ikari in Japan, which means furious.
6273275	6275776	This is very, very cool.
6275796	6286123	It used rotary joysticks and had a two-player mode, and it has Ralph and Clark that later showed up in the King of Fighters series, which we know Ralph and Clark, don't we?
6289018	6292219	They also make an appearance in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7.
6293120	6299362	At any rate, you are Ralph and Clark, these commando dudes, and they're trying to reach the village of Ikari.
6300422	6308444	And basically, you get attacked with tanks and soldiers and helicopters, but you get power-ups on the way.
6308985	6313286	Because power-ups really do show up in real life when you're trying to charge the village of Furious.
6315210	6326477	At any rate, this was one of the first major games, like I said, to use a rotary joystick, which, like I said, you can rotate as well as push in the different directions.
6327538	6333101	And your buttons, one of them was your gun, and the other one was for throwing grenades, so you could blow them up.
6334222	6340406	And it also was fully cooperative, one of the early games to do that, and had vehicles in it.
6342012	6348097	So they actually did an SNK pinout and they did a JAMA pinout.
6349078	6360026	So for people with the arcade SNK machines, it worked in those.
6360767	6361387	So it was pretty cool.
6363048	6366991	And it was really cool.
6367052	6368633	It had different...
6370132	6371073	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6399025	6401747	There was a DOS version that came out.
6403028	6404409	And there were sequels.
6404489	6410332	There was Victory Road, also in 1986, in Ikari 3, The Rescue.
6411513	6423920	And then there was also a Guerrilla War arcane called Guevara in Japan that used a similar type of gameplay that featured Che Guevara and Fidel Castro as the main guys.
6425121	6436636	But as for the other versions that came out, there was the NES version, Apple II, DOS, Atari ST, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Armstrong CPC.
6437377	6439721	The NES version was so glitched out.
6439841	6440442	I agree.
6440582	6442104	But ABBA was a code.
6444368	6445509	That made the game awesome.
6446630	6451215	There was an MSX version of it and different 16-bit versions that came out.
6451235	6456320	There's actually two different Commodore 64 version ROBs.
6457180	6460243	One was put out by Data East and the other one was by Elite.
6460624	6462065	Interesting, because I only remember one of them.
6462345	6462986	I had one of them.
6464935	6465596	I remember this game.
6466756	6471920	The Atari ST and Amiga versions are supposed to have better graphics and sound effects.
6473001	6476803	And the NES version was developed by Microtronics.
6477724	6480566	And the problem with the NES one is it was flashy, flashy, flash, flash, flash.
6480746	6482127	Glitch-tastic.
6482887	6483668	But it's a cool game.
6484480	6484820	I love the NES.
6499898	6500258	That's it.
6500739	6501399	Alright, there it is.
6501419	6502640	Your classic game of the week.
6503020	6504081	And I'll tell you how I picked it.
6504961	6508344	I went in the vault, grabbed one of the bins, and put my finger on a game.
6508364	6509344	Very nice.
6509384	6509925	That's how I picked it.
6510005	6510705	That's how you picked it.
6511186	6512226	That's how she does it, folks.
6512647	6518310	But I approve because, you know, again, any game that uses ABBA as a code, it's awesome.
6518531	6519411	Are they dancing queens?
6519951	6522693	I cannot imagine Ralph and Clark doing disco dancing.
6522813	6528998	Contrary to what Spazinator is saying in chat, ABBA will not play an 8-bit version of Dancing Queen, although I think that should be in a future game.
6529278	6529638	Just saying.
6531659	6535601	All right, so that's going to wrap up this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
6535621	6542025	There is plenty more to come in Part B. We've got more news, lots and lots of good stuff, Twitter topics.
6542205	6544627	And tonight, I'm so excited because Jessica's here.
6544667	6546408	We thought we'd do something special.
6546868	6549490	We're going to do listless tonight with Jessica.
6549670	6551371	And the topic tonight, you ready for this?
6552412	6555174	Because Jessica's got to think about this because I'm springing this on her during break.
6555214	6555594	Here we go.
6555934	6556835	The topic tonight...
6557535	6562937	The thing I learned most from DDR Freak is tonight's listless topic.
6563297	6566318	The thing I learned most from DDR Freak.
6566338	6569078	It's going to be a fun night, ladies and gentlemen.
6569759	6573720	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6579552	6582514	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6582554	6589097	We are live on October the 17th of 2010 with the 386th episode of our show.
6589397	6591018	We're a super fast computer if this is 1982.
6591058	6591138	Or 1992.
6591198	6591418	Excuse me, 386.
6591458	6592799	There you go.
6592839	6593099	I had a 38620.
6593179	6593859	My first PC was a 386SX16.
6593879	6595880	And that's running in turbo mode.
6595900	6596501	Otherwise it's a 38616.
6596541	6596661	With
6607546	6610888	with, get this, a 30 megabyte hard drive.
6610988	6612049	Oh my god!
6612469	6615211	And one megabyte of RAM.
6615511	6616672	Holy shit!
6618133	6619114	Running Windows 3.1.
6620135	6622196	Actually, I think it was 3.0 at that time.
6622716	6625838	My friend's dad is an engineer, back in the 40s.
6626599	6632503	And he was talking about one time we were visiting and he was saying that they lined the room in magnets to make 1K of memory.
6632963	6633223	Wow.
6634244	6635505	So think about that.
6635565	6636066	Fun stuff.
6636126	6637387	And now what are we running?
6638187	6641230	You can go spend $90 and get a terabyte hard drive.
6642331	6642711	No problem.
6643051	6643712	No problem.
6644252	6645113	For it for all.
6645353	6651779	If you're just joining us after this break, the other voice you hear there is our lovely guest tonight, Jessica Harper from Under Sedation Live.
6652159	6654941	But we remember her as Iguana Girl from DDR Freak.
6655001	6655582	Girl.
6655682	6656002	Girl.
6656022	6656342	I'm sorry.
6656402	6657543	Iguana Girl.
6657563	6659065	Iguana Girl.
6659125	6659245	Girl.
6661266	6662087	So, there you go.
6662247	6667430	And she's here tonight because she's helping us reminisce about the good old days of DDR and all that.
6667510	6669452	And, you know, kind of where are they now?
6669512	6675035	And we definitely found out some interesting stuff in Part A about the behind-the-scenes operations of DDR Freak.
6675436	6678338	Now I know what types of questions not to ask moving forward.
6678918	6686823	But I don't know how much you can kind of say about this, but I know you eventually stepped down as administrator of DDR Freak, as most people do.
6686864	6688204	You know, these things kind of come in cycles.
6688224	6689685	There's only so much time you can give up.
6689745	6689866	But...
6691446	6694328	What do you kind of think about where DDR Freak is at now?
6694368	6696069	Do you think it's kind of past its prime?
6696109	6697250	It's old and dead and gone?
6697410	6697630	Dead.
6698390	6708996	There's still a few people that are straggling in there, but even Random Chat, which is the absolute most frequented forum, it will go a full day without any kind of hits at all at this point.
6709376	6713318	I tried looking back like six months ago and was completely depressed.
6714179	6721767	Yeah, there's the occasional where are they now type of thread, but pretty much what's going on at this point is just eh.
6722408	6723109	What happened?
6723469	6725732	It used to be the place to be.
6726252	6727894	I think that most of it is just the
6728715	6738178	The mainstream nature of DDR has kind of killed it a bit, and a lot of the old school people don't necessarily like the new class, so to speak.
6738478	6748401	I think that just overall, the site started getting slower and slower, started having issues, and people just weren't as interested anymore.
6748421	6748901	Yeah.
6749241	6755427	Sadly, you're probably right, and I think probably Konami's lack of support for DDR for a very long time probably contributed to that.
6755448	6755768	Oh, yes.
6755948	6758250	Yeah, definitely, so that's a bummer, but...
6759932	6763013	Are there any other forums that you surf these days that we can find you on?
6764313	6765274	Not particularly.
6765654	6769735	Most of what I do is just, you know, I sit and play on Facebook most of the time.
6770655	6773196	Yeah, I just, I already have a group of friends.
6773296	6776817	I'm not really necessarily looking to go search out a whole new group of friends or anything.
6776857	6778978	So I just kind of do my own thing.
6780051	6784333	But you can at least be found Saturday nights at Under Station Live right here at All Games Radio.
6784353	6789816	Yes, and I do also have a Facebook that is my public Facebook for Under Station Live.
6789836	6792378	You can find me under Jessica Harper on Facebook if you want to add me.
6793378	6797060	And I'll sometimes post interesting pictures and what have you through that.
6797200	6800762	So, yeah, kind of an online version of me.
6801565	6802646	All right, check that out.
6802886	6803207	Sounds good.
6804167	6806189	Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick news.
6806269	6811954	I do want to say, though, first, since Jessica's our guest this week, we already have a guest lined up for next week as well.
6812315	6814517	It's like suddenly we're like the month of guests.
6814577	6818120	I like this because it's another in-studio guest, which is very exciting.
6818881	6820482	Seg is going to be here next week.
6820682	6820902	Oops.
6821703	6823064	Apparently Seg has theme music.
6823845	6824366	Sorry about that.
6826505	6829447	Fail on my part, the music bag, or the mailbag music aired a little early.
6829767	6845059	Seg is going to be here next week and he's going to talk all about Umlaut, which is his big, and if you've been listening to the show for a while, you probably heard him on the show last year, but this time he's going to come in studio so he can actually talk to us throughout the night and definitely pimp Umlaut, which is going on, well, it's not going on right now, but the
6845399	6848023	Pre-Antics are going on right now on the website.
6848364	6849285	Umlaut.org.
6849365	6851168	It's a fundraiser, of course, for Child's Play.
6851489	6853392	It's going to happen in San Francisco in December.
6853552	6856477	All the details are there at Umlaut.org.
6856497	6858119	You don't even have to know how to type the Umlaut.
6858159	6858840	When is it, Ian?
6859381	6860323	It is December...
6860783	6862764	They're going to be running Rock Band 3 this time?
6862824	6863845	Yeah, I believe so.
6863865	6866246	We're going to get all the details from SAG next week, so I don't want to spoil everything.
6866586	6868927	But I believe it's December 9th?
6869468	6870428	It's a Thursday.
6870708	6872850	I remember that, because it got bumped up.
6873250	6876572	Because last year it was on a Monday, and now it's a bigger deal this year.
6876632	6877512	So it's actually on a Thursday.
6877792	6878713	So we've got to ask about that.
6878793	6879473	Oh, I got the date right.
6879513	6880053	It is December 9th, 2010.
6881554	6884137	And yes, I do believe Rock Band 3 is a part of it as well.
6884457	6885619	We're going to get all the details.
6886219	6890704	There's going to be some big, big, big band package deals that weren't around last year.
6890724	6892606	We're going to talk about that as well.
6892926	6898252	If you're not in the San Francisco Bay Area and you don't feel like driving or flying out here for it, you still can donate online.
6899013	6903878	umloud.org, U-M-L-O-U-D dot O-R-G for all the details.
6904418	6905019	Thank you for watching!
6919949	6921931	There's these little NDAs and things.
6922011	6925434	And pitch him our idea for the Elvira adventure game.
6925474	6926936	He's listening right now, so he might have heard it.
6927216	6928838	But yes, we'll try to pitch him our ideas.
6929298	6934463	And at least the games that are out, we can hopefully ask some good questions on and all that stuff.
6934543	6935124	So that'll be good.
6935404	6937886	We're going to talk to them about all that fun stuff next week.
6939027	6939728	Something to look forward to.
6940048	6942930	I like this whole having guests every week thing.
6942970	6949016	We had Tiara a couple weeks ago, and now we have Guanagirl, Jessica Harper's here tonight, and then we've got Seg next week.
6949476	6950037	This is great.
6951077	6952819	We've got to get some more game developers in here, too.
6952859	6956302	I don't know if we can get them to travel all the way out to SAC, but we know the Skype thing works okay.
6957302	6958762	Take a sleep on my couch
6975487	6978109	Definitely if you have Twitter questions about the old school days, we'd love to hear it.
6978170	6979731	Although we will happily take any topic.
6980051	6981793	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6981853	6983114	Get those tweets in right now.
6983454	6987138	You got about five minutes, five to ten minutes while we do some fast news.
6987958	6990360	And if you don't submit tweets, I'm going to let Jessica just tweet all night.
6991021	6991541	Tweet, tweet.
6992361	7011887	and then I'll play the Rockin' Robin song and then let her do the tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet exactly alright in the meantime quick news Loki oh my god you better run out in a hurry and pick up Outrun Online Arcade because if you procrastinate for another 13 months then you may not be able to get it
7012587	7013008	But it's Outrun!
7013028	7013148	Outrun!
7042785	7044668	I don't have 50 million other versions of Outrun.
7046850	7053078	It's a bummer that it's getting pulled for an understandable reason, but at the same time it's kind of dumb.
7053518	7055020	But at least it's not getting pulled because it sucks.
7056762	7057984	We have loads of cash.
7058044	7058985	We are Italian.
7059025	7059666	Go ahead and have it.
7061715	7067078	Back to the Future Telltale's new game Back to the Future, the video game I liked that one
7088601	7089341	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7118619	7119159	Anyway, sorry.
7120139	7120540	Anyways.
7122020	7123540	But the Back to the Future is kind of a big deal.
7123600	7125761	The Blu-ray is kind of a big deal.
7125821	7128002	It's getting a lot of like... You know what's kind of weird though?
7128422	7132223	Is they've already given away the coupon code, I guess.
7132803	7138644	I don't know if it's going to be exclusive to each one or if it's just saying... But it says apparently there is a...
7140865	7142886	A picture of the actual code thing.
7142926	7155275	It says, the URL insert list, a URL for redeeming the included code, 121 gigawatts, which currently directs the browsers to the game's homepage.
7156215	7161939	It says, of course, it will go live as they get closer to it.
7162520	7170165	So, I don't know if 1.2 or 121 gigawatt is going to be the code, but
7171225	7173767	Hey, something a little extra if you buy Back to the Future.
7174768	7178530	And you should because it's an awesome movie series and they keep replaying it on G4 for some reason.
7178670	7181672	And I'm pretty sure the game this time will be much better than the NES one.
7181712	7182352	Just call it a hunch.
7182452	7183273	Oh, yeah.
7183313	7183813	Call it a hunch.
7183913	7184334	Seriously.
7185394	7188196	Because they have like Christopher Lloyd actually doing voice acting and all that, right?
7188396	7188636	Yes.
7188676	7189177	It's gonna be epic.
7189357	7192058	Get him to say as many things as possible before he dies.
7192379	7193279	I mean, seriously.
7193680	7196281	Just have him read the whole dictionary and we'll be done with it.
7196561	7197402	He was a Klingon once.
7199537	7200838	That's interesting.
7201638	7201819	Yes.
7203240	7205801	He should host a science show as Doc Brown.
7205941	7207843	That would be awesome.
7208223	7209624	Seg is actually in our chat tonight.
7210164	7211065	Happy to hear about his appearance.
7211105	7215308	He's actually saying that theaters are going to be showing Back to the Future at the end of this month.
7215388	7216949	I guess it's like a revival thing.
7217009	7217649	That's awesome.
7217669	7218110	That's cool.
7218130	7218390	Sweet.
7218430	7221212	No, but seriously though, Christopher Lloyd needs to host a science show.
7221332	7222132	Screw Bill Nye.
7222973	7224254	Can I be honest about something though?
7224934	7228697	I've never seen the original Back to the Future the whole way through actually.
7230208	7230808	What?
7231048	7232389	Out!
7232769	7233209	I haven't.
7233289	7233669	Seriously.
7233769	7234430	Here's the funny thing.
7234710	7241773	I've seen the third movie the whole way through because they showed it when I was in seventh grade on VHS or whatever.
7242193	7243993	I have never seen the original movie the whole way through.
7244334	7248955	I saw the first one in the theater, the third one in the theater, and I didn't see the second one until I was an adult.
7249976	7252917	There's always that one movie you miss as a kid, except I missed a few.
7254975	7256037	What was your first movie, Rob?
7256317	7257199	My first movie?
7257539	7258981	Do you remember?
7259061	7259622	Were you told?
7260003	7265911	I was told that I was taken to see The Empire Strikes Back at the 99 Cent Theater.
7266051	7267694	We kind of have something in common then.
7268254	7269857	My first movie was Star Wars.
7270367	7270487	E.T.
7270507	7271288	at the drive-in
7293764	7295966	I'm pretty sure you saw E.T., but the one I can only remember.
7296026	7296787	I saw E.T.
7296827	7297407	in the theater.
7298228	7298288	E.T.
7298428	7299409	was probably before all that.
7299809	7302232	I was, what, five, six?
7303473	7306355	I also remember going to see The Aristocats by Disney.
7306836	7309578	The first movie that I saw four times in a row, though, was Wrath of Khan.
7310828	7320996	I remember also we went to a drive-in to see, it was a double feature, Shrimp on the Barbie and Batman.
7321236	7324278	And I really wanted to see Batman.
7324578	7329903	And unfortunately Shrimp on the Barbie was... The fuck do those two movies have in common?
7329943	7330823	They always do that.
7331244	7336488	I have no idea, but for some reason I fell asleep through Batman.
7338089	7339130	And I woke up, I'm like...
7340250	7341271	Where's Batman?
7341291	7345794	My mom's like, we tried to wake you up, but you said you wanted to sleep.
7345854	7347095	I'm like, no, I didn't!
7349377	7350377	I eventually saw it later on.
7351018	7352199	It was kind of funny, though.
7353520	7354220	Shrimp on the barbecue.
7354240	7356282	Yes, that would put you to sleep, I can imagine.
7357883	7362246	But that must have been the second movie, for some reason, because if I slept through Batman...
7363760	7372989	Anyways, sorry, since we're talking about movies though, there of course is rumors that the Uncharted movie needs to move forward.
7373349	7379995	People want this to become a movie because I guess, you know, the game lends itself well to a movie.
7381036	7384780	And funny enough, the main character, which has been compared to Nathan Fillion...
7385460	7413406	um actually now Nathan Fillion is trying to start a campaign on Twitter to be cast as Nathan Drake so um that's interesting because I guess he looks kind of like the main character he does a little bit but I don't know I don't see the entire resemblance there but he's sort of I mean it could work there'd be fanboys that would be very happy if that were to happen I don't know I'd drool
7415839	7416779	Dan's telling you he's too old.
7417060	7418440	Yeah, Dan's piping in from the other end.
7418460	7418720	You're right.
7418980	7420901	Danny Glover needs to be Nathan Drake.
7420921	7422402	It's okay.
7422442	7424102	A man's got to do what a man's got to do.
7425023	7426684	Let's get Betty White to be Nathan Drake.
7430685	7431966	Dan says, should do.
7431986	7432906	Dan approves of Betty White.
7435107	7439269	You need to cast Betty White in like a big blockbuster action flick.
7439349	7443511	I still want to see Red because, I mean, can you imagine Helen Mirren with an AK?
7443531	7444231	What?
7445479	7448401	And actually, here you go, an action movie starring Betty White called Grandma Death.
7449862	7450603	I would go see it.
7451204	7451664	You know what?
7451684	7452425	That's awesome.
7453265	7455787	Well, keep in mind, they did the Machete movie, remember?
7456028	7456968	That's true, there you go.
7457029	7459991	You know, the movie based off of a trailer of a non-existent movie?
7460091	7461052	Uh-huh.
7461232	7463894	They could do another Grindhouse movie with Betty White in it.
7464135	7464695	Grandma Death?
7464915	7465376	Grandma Death.
7465396	7467037	It'd be like Kill Bill, but it's Betty White.
7467377	7467578	Great.
7469503	7472324	Hopefully she does all her own stuff.
7472344	7475926	Too bad Barbara Billingsley is dead because she can be her co-star.
7476166	7477086	Well, you know what?
7477807	7478747	Only if she talked Jive.
7478867	7481808	As long as she can get her before she starts to decompose, it might be alright.
7482609	7485550	I watched an interview of her about learning to talk Jive, by the way.
7485590	7488611	So did I. Yours would be a bit like, kill Ernest.
7489352	7490192	Ernest Borgnine.
7490252	7490612	Yeah.
7494625	7495306	That would be awesome.
7495386	7496648	Let's move on with some news.
7496708	7498872	I don't know how we got on to this whole Betty White.
7503772	7504573	All right, let's move on.
7505273	7506134	Crazy Taxi.
7506695	7507856	It's Crazy Taxi.
7507976	7513261	It's coming out on November 23rd on the PlayStation Network, November 24th on Xbox Live Arcade.
7513621	7516924	If you're ready to get some crazy money, it's going to cost you $10.
7517004	7517985	It will be widescreen.
7518025	7522009	It will have 720p high def graphics.
7522409	7527494	It will not have the offspring music, sadly, and it will not have Pizza Hut.
7527554	7527954	Sorry.
7527994	7528515	No, it's not.
7528935	7531916	All these games have an options menu where you can turn down the music.
7531976	7540219	So what you do, turn down whatever crap music they end up putting in the game and then do a Xbox 360 custom soundtrack.
7555944	7559286	Why didn't they get new licensing?
7559326	7563589	I'm sure KFC would do it in like, you know, Old Navy or something.
7564469	7565730	Take me to Old Navy!
7567651	7568932	No, bitch, off the pier!
7572386	7573946	You're driving too fast!
7574166	7575127	Take me to the Gap!
7575227	7576607	Not until they change the logo, bitch!
7576907	7577667	They did, they fixed it.
7577687	7579308	Oh yeah, I heard, I heard.
7579488	7580588	No, seriously, get this.
7580668	7582169	Not even that.
7583509	7586710	For some reason, my non-designer friends were talking about typography with me.
7587590	7591511	And I was like, yeah, they were using Helvetica and it was ugly, a bad use of Helvetica.
7591771	7596312	And so I went to look to find it and there's no more pictures of it online except for the Gap logo sucks Twitter.
7597633	7598733	They hunted that shit down.
7599853	7601994	You know, kind of an interesting point in chat.
7602655	7605896	What if all the licenses had been stuff that is now gone?
7606156	7607677	Like, take me to Tower Records!
7610118	7611259	That would be sad.
7611519	7612619	That would be sadness.
7614120	7615561	Take me to Tower, I mean, Dipple!
7616741	7617542	No, they're still there.
7617882	7619484	Wait, I'm sorry.
7619724	7620645	Take me to Tower Records.
7620745	7621545	No, I mean R5.
7621645	7622386	No, I mean Dimple.
7623967	7624588	Or what else?
7624708	7627791	What other big things have closed down lately that just all went under?
7628231	7629092	Take me to Mervin's.
7630453	7630733	Can't.
7630893	7632235	Montgomery Ward's.
7637717	7658628	Rock Band News There's a whole list of Rock Band songs available in this little web widget that you can embed in your site It's in celebration of the 2000th song to hit Rock Band Going to find research online can be kind of tough There's a whole little widget that made its way to a lot of gaming blogs
7658988	7667689	and the cool thing is you can search you can sort by artist, you can sort by year, you can sort by the genre and it's just basically like a quick online little web widget to find the finder.
7667729	7674531	So if you want to see okay, Lady Gaga Why am I not surprised?
7674571	7678771	There are four Lady Gaga songs in the game.
7678811	7679011	He's gay!
7680732	7681532	What's your point?
7681872	7685112	And then there's one Eric Cartman Lady Gaga song that's in there.
7685212	7685893	Oh, that's great.
7686113	7686493	There you go.
7688664	7689606	One more story for you guys.
7689746	7690527	Another music game.
7690567	7693070	DJ Hero 2 is getting some download contents.
7693211	7696675	The first comes in November is the first pack.
7696756	7699660	It's going to be the Hitmakers Mix Pack.
7700721	7703906	Rihanna's Umbrella versus Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.
7704406	7705467	That might be kind of interesting.
7705767	7708089	Two weeks later, an Electro Hits mix pack.
7708109	7709870	That might be kind of awesome, actually.
7710611	7718958	Actually, the Electro Hits, it has LMFAO with I'm in Miami trick, because they have to change the lyrics, mixed with Green Velvet, Shake and Pop.
7719218	7720579	Some of this might be kind of awesome, actually.
7721279	7723781	That's all coming out in November.
7724161	7740033	By the way, there will also be a free compatibility update in November to enable support for the existing DJ Hero DLC in DJ Hero 2, which is great because the best DJ Hero song was that Mary J. Blige All of Me vs. Queen Radio Gaga.
7740053	7741434	There was no better song in the game.
7741554	7742835	That was pretty fantastic.
7742855	7743455	That was my favorite.
7743475	7746097	Rob, let's make that our after show music.
7747075	7747416	Maybe.
7748058	7748620	If I can find it.
7749683	7750004	Alright.
7750446	7752592	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7752981	7753742	I have stuff.
7754522	7754942	Things.
7755743	7757504	How about some Guitar Hero stuff?
7758245	7762028	I don't think this is enough to save them, though, even though I think it's amazing.
7763029	7775998	There is going to be a free three-pack for Gold members that has Disturbs the Infection, Muses Resistance, cool song, My Chemical Romance is Na Na Na, another band that I like.
7777259	7781522	It will be available to be purchased by Silver Live users on October 19th.
7782743	7798354	and then on the 26th of October there will be a Rocky Horror Picture Show pack and that's pretty cool it has Time Warp and Sweet Transvestite and Hot Patootie and also completely unrelated is Soundgarden's Telephantasm
7799631	7802752	Sadly, not enough to get me to spend $60 on the game, but I think it's really cool.
7803412	7807354	And it also reminds me that the Rocky Horror Blu-ray is out, I believe, this Tuesday.
7807714	7810095	So I kind of want to check that out because I'm curious how it turned out.
7810115	7815477	You know, I was saying that that's the only thing that's probably going to remotely get me to watch that show that starts with a G that I don't like.
7816843	7820846	and Imagine That exactly 10 years after they released the DVD.
7821547	7822367	They released the Blu-ray.
7822387	7823208	Here comes the Blu-ray.
7823408	7826871	And apparently it's got a live shadow cast thing going on in it and all this stuff.
7826991	7827972	Picture in picture.
7828352	7828993	Could be interesting.
7829193	7829553	I don't know.
7829693	7830194	I'm curious.
7830894	7834657	And don't think this whole Rocky Horror Glee thing isn't a cross promotion.
7834737	7839301	I will bet money there's a commercial for the Blu-ray during the Glee episode.
7839441	7841523	Although, you know what I really, really want to see?
7841723	7841943	What?
7842644	7844305	Is Tony Head as Frank.
7846739	7875096	we got to see that at that same convention we played I understand that he brought it in person I understand that he brought his own gear you might still be able to catch it they'll probably play it a little bit closer but VH1, they were actually filming a karaoke version you can probably find it on YouTube actually of Anthony Head playing he's so great I loved the single that he did that was really great I'm positive you can find that on YouTube
7875616	7878597	I'm gonna be looking something up tonight when I'm supposed to be doing my homework.
7879438	7882199	Alan very much wants me to watch that Rocky Horror Glee episode.
7882239	7883960	I mean, I think Glee's okay.
7884040	7890623	I watched about half the first season, and you know, it's fine, but I really am not liking this idea of them doing the Rocky Horror because I know it's just gonna be hard to watch.
7890643	7893004	Have you actually watched the stuff that Richard's been posting?
7893584	7896085	I've heard some of the songs that were posted, and...
7896886	7897686	Watch some of the stuff.
7899087	7901068	I do not watch Glee at all.
7901768	7904949	I will never watch Glee after this, but I'll probably watch this one.
7905370	7906570	I don't know.
7907110	7909972	I heard the way they did Sweet Transvestite and I'm not a fan.
7910292	7914854	I like the Dammit Janet and some of the other stuff though, but I'm curious.
7914954	7919676	I will watch it, but Alan's like, you need to sit there and live blog it and tape your eyes open.
7919736	7920736	You gotta watch the whole thing.
7921216	7924438	And I'm just kind of like, only if you do too, because he hates Glee.
7924458	7924618	Yeah.
7926138	7930139	I have to say, I did look at the stills they had in the sets and costumes.
7930159	7932100	It looked pretty awesome.
7932360	7937281	I don't like that they had to dumb it down for broadcast TV.
7938082	7942643	I understand you can't have somebody portraying a teenager running around in the Rocky costume.
7942683	7943083	I get that.
7943123	7943543	That's fine.
7943863	7946524	But they really, really washed down some of the lyrics.
7946744	7949785	I'm just a sweet transvestite from sensational Transylvania.
7950245	7950505	Really?
7951638	7953279	It kind of defeats the point, honey.
7953800	7954000	Yeah.
7954020	7954360	Whatever.
7955621	7955941	Oh, well.
7956241	7958283	I'll watch it and it won't be that bad.
7958323	7961985	I think it would be more interesting to visit transsexual than sensational.
7962265	7968650	I should be happy that at least it's getting attention and it'll bring more curious kids to the midnight movie.
7968730	7970671	And then it'll die off like it always does.
7970711	7970992	Yes.
7971492	7972713	But at least we'll have that moment.
7972753	7978357	But, by the way, they are doing a Rocky Horror Show downtown right now.
7978817	7979297	Oh really?
7979317	7979938	I want to go.
7979958	7980618	I have no idea.
7981078	7982939	I'll have to send you guys the invite so you can take a look.
7982959	7983339	Please do.
7983399	7986081	It's like 15 bucks and they're actually doing live performances.
7986681	7989483	It started this past weekend all the way through until Halloween.
7989983	7990363	Let's go.
7990843	7991644	I kind of want to go.
7991884	7992724	I want to go a lot.
7992824	7993325	I have no idea.
7993345	7995646	Remember we saw when ARC put it on.
7996126	7996346	Yeah.
7996366	7996766	That's cute.
7996826	7997307	I saw that too.
7997967	7998287	DarkSakura
8021655	8025356	Other news, Dead Space is going to be coming out on the iPad.
8025576	8027777	It will be out in December according to EA.
8029878	8036180	They're saying that there's a big press event at Tokyo's Apple Store that will be featuring this.
8037220	8041882	And it's a third-person shooter, no rails, no changing modes.
8042603	8049386	Nothing said about the iPhone, so maybe it will be better than the Xbox Live Arcade version?
8049506	8050506	So, who knows?
8051466	8051787	Who cares?
8052967	8059490	Xbox Live Arcade, other news, is in nine more countries now, starting on 10th of November.
8059510	8061371	So maybe not now, but in the futures.
8062971	8069955	Russia, Poland, South Africa, Greece, Czech Republic, Hungary, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile
8084942	8090005	I must go to bed, but it's 2am, but I have to see number 7!
8090886	8092667	I read about it on CNN, I didn't watch a minute of it.
8092687	8093927	You know what I thought was awesome about it?
8094007	8097229	Is that it totally wasn't the overblown media circus that it would have been in America.
8097770	8103033	And the freaking president came out by himself without guards or anything to help with the effort.
8103353	8105334	To be there with the families, and that was cool.
8105474	8108296	I was reminded of, pardon the pun, Baby Jessica.
8109136	8109316	Yes.
8109336	8110257	Watching that whole thing.
8110297	8110677	Remember?
8110877	8111798	Back in the day.
8111878	8112519	Back in the day.
8112639	8114220	Way before most of our listeners were born.
8114280	8115061	You know what?
8115181	8118744	I read an interview with her where she says, God, I can't believe people remember me for that.
8119684	8119844	What?
8119884	8120145	Yeah.
8120245	8121265	Can you imagine being her?
8121325	8122366	Like, you don't remember that shit.
8122386	8123507	She was like a year and a half.
8123547	8124568	That's really what she seems like.
8124608	8125449	I don't remember any of this.
8125669	8125909	Yeah.
8126209	8126950	And I guess the whole.
8127010	8127730	Oh, shit.
8127810	8128871	I fell down a well.
8129071	8129352	Gee.
8131234	8133036	Guess who's never live now.
8133096	8133456	Yay.
8133476	8134137	Here's the part.
8134217	8135358	Here's the thing, honey.
8136378	8139501	She got like a million dollars worth of money.
8139541	8144645	People just sent gifts, money, unsolicited, but people just sent baby Jessica college money.
8144665	8146246	I think she was saying that's how she went to school.
8146366	8148388	Yeah, and it all got put in a trust fund.
8148728	8151170	I want to say I was reading online next year or something.
8151390	8155254	She's getting like a million dollars because it's all been saved and growing and all that stuff.
8155274	8155454	Yeah.
8155934	8157679	Here's a lesson to mothers.
8157739	8161207	Stop watching your children around wells if you want them set for life.
8161929	8164195	This is what we teach here in America.
8165617	8171502	But yeah, you just need to have like eight kids all at once and everybody will give you tons of money for diapers and crap.
8171602	8175665	And wear fake Dolce & Gabbana glasses and drink your Starbucks every morning.
8175785	8176606	Yep.
8177247	8183992	But this means that now Xbox Live is servicing 35 countries at once.
8184993	8185854	It sure gets around.
8186855	8187455	In a row?
8188116	8188556	That's 37, dude.
8188636	8191218	So we just need to give it two more.
8194669	8211178	it can service Luxembourg try not to service any more countries on your way to the parking lot alright if that's it for the rapid news tonight let's get to the twitter topics tweet tweet tweet tweet
8214912	8219596	What happened to the big box stores boycotting third party Wii games that are nothing but minigames?
8238558	8239258	That's a good question.
8239639	8240739	Do you know anything about this, Loki?
8240799	8244061	Weren't stores supposed to be boycotting Wii games that were nothing but mini-games?
8244101	8245082	I remember hearing about this, too.
8245102	8246103	It was on the show.
8246303	8247904	I think they do to a certain extent.
8247944	8263633	I mean, most stores nowadays realize that only the first-party or big third-party games are really the only things they're selling, so they're buying a lot less of the third-party games that are just crap, as they should be doing with their dollars.
8264354	8265935	But I don't think people are...
8266215	8266615	Imagine Babies
8291949	8294030	All right, moving on to other tweets.
8295391	8300294	TigerClaw305 sends us some links, and I always let him get in a couple tweets here because there's good stuff.
8300694	8301735	I haven't heard this one either.
8301855	8313341	Apparently, one of the EA developers is saying, and this is a pretty ballsy thing to say from a tweet, again, sent to us from TigerClaw, Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs.
8314642	8315122	What?
8316203	8316603	What?
8317363	8317884	This is like...
8319165	8325632	That's really interesting to hear because I was under the assumption that this is going to be as close to WoW as it gets.
8325772	8326333	You know what I mean?
8326633	8330478	And I'm not talking... Again, I don't want to like... It'll be WoW without the suck.
8331279	8332440	I don't want to make... Girl.
8333081	8337826	I don't want to make it sound like WoW and another big MMO are capable of coexisting.
8338908	8342331	It doesn't have to be that this has to take away from WoW.
8342592	8345855	But I always thought that this was really going to be the next big MMO.
8345935	8348658	So it's kind of interesting that this whole thing is coming up here.
8349059	8351381	DDR Dollar Bill says, I thought APB was the fail.
8351822	8355406	Well, it's coming from an EA Mythic employee who's going to be laid off next month.
8355606	8358830	And they unloaded on the division for the Old Republic.
8359430	8359931	and DarkSakura.com.
8379810	8382973	Something like a 20 gig installation and most of it is voiceover work.
8383234	8384215	That's the best they have.
8384255	8385456	The rest of the game is a joke.
8385816	8387498	EA knows it and so does George Lucas.
8387558	8394486	They're panicking and so much of Mythic has already been cannibalized to work in Austin on it because they can't keep pushing back launch.
8394866	8398029	Old Republic will be one of the greatest failures in the history of MMOs from EA.
8398310	8400132	Probably at the level of The Sims Online.
8400172	8401153	We all know it too.
8401773	8425665	hmm now he could just be being bitter about the whole layoff thing so take it with a grain of salt but that's that's the first like really really negative thing I've heard about it aren't they doing like top secret testing right now I want to say I heard somewhere that there is testing going on for the game right now but it's under super duper NDA lock and key so that's why you're not hearing a lot of stuff externally you think some loud mouth is going to come out and dispute this I don't know
8426986	8434115	Anyhow, one other quick story from Tiger5 They're doing it under the name Final Fantasy XIV He sent me a few, but I'm going to stick with two here
8434468	8435008	Tweet, tweet!
8435829	8436649	Yes, he sent two tweets.
8436689	8437029	Tweet, tweet.
8437630	8441392	Apparently, Mike Tyson's punch-out has been reimagined on the iPhone.
8442152	8443093	I mean, ripped off.
8443813	8444254	Pretty much.
8445034	8445334	Let's see.
8445434	8447275	Rock Software created this game.
8447775	8452638	You fight as a character named Lil Sammy, and then eventually you take on Mike Tyson.
8453038	8459682	I have no idea if they actually got a license or whatever, but you go through ten fights that lead up to Tyson.
8460363	8462724	There it is, and there's a whole little picture there.
8463104	8464666	It should be a better Evander Holyfield.
8466567	8467648	You should play as little Mike.
8468329	8471832	I'm curious if they actually have the licensing because that could be very bad for them if not.
8472733	8474655	He probably needs the money.
8474695	8476076	He's like, you can do it for $5.
8477079	8477479	That could be.
8477619	8478520	Or I'll bite your ear off.
8479460	8480581	It's going to be 99 cents though.
8481061	8482602	Spazinator wants to give us a heads up.
8482662	8487665	There's a free episode of Sengoku Basara Samurai Warriors Anime on the PSN Video Store right now.
8487945	8489886	Could that have anything to do with the game that just came out?
8491147	8491567	Who knows?
8492227	8493168	It's a mystery to everyone.
8493894	8497076	Alright, here's an old-time Q&A from SSJ100Matt.
8497096	8498076	Thank you, SSJ100Matt.
8498096	8498656	Tweet, tweet!
8499057	8506880	With the 400th episode coming up, have you thought about getting the DDR gang back together and doing an episode at RVGL?
8508308	8510451	Last time we did an episode of RVGL, we almost got kicked out.
8510491	8512774	However, here's an idea I do like.
8512794	8513475	Think about this, folks.
8525532	8525992	Matt and Mike
8553938	8565163	Convinced Loki Step Squad and RTF That's a good idea The old school Mount Mikes in Concord And that would be a nice middle place Because it would only be about an hour and ten minutes away from here Excellent idea
8566454	8567455	And they do have good pizza.
8568956	8569517	And decent beer.
8569537	8570217	Are they still there?
8570237	8571138	Do they still have DDR?
8571398	8572579	As far as I know.
8573580	8578645	I would love to do that for the 400th episode and try to get all the old school people we can.
8579085	8584109	It might be tricky on a Sunday night, but we're about 14 weeks away.
8584329	8586772	It's going to be mid-January, I think, is when we hit 400.
8588493	8589294	We got time to plan it.
8589494	8592877	So that's just my fantasy dream thing.
8593297	8604848	Another thing to consider is that maybe I could sweet talk a particular friend of mine who is married to another friend of mine who has a DDR solo machine in their garage.
8605168	8606570	I knew who you were talking about.
8606950	8607811	Nudge, nudge.
8608812	8610093	I'll have to talk to them separately.
8610113	8611995	Yours is wired with a PlayStation in theirs.
8612535	8613415	Yeah, but it's still cool.
8613495	8616336	I have the guts for a DDR machine, just no pads.
8617176	8618696	They have a solo and no game.
8621037	8623137	So that's an idea.
8623998	8625798	You take your thing and put it in their thing?
8626178	8628839	And then you make a brand new thing!
8630999	8638861	It's technically a Dance Maniacs J-Append, but right now it could easily be converted into a DDR machine.
8639981	8640541	Link, link, link
8670186	8671246	I'll post that in chat right now.
8671266	8672007	That's great.
8672767	8674968	So that she who is nearsighted can see it.
8677168	8678829	That is fantastic.
8679509	8680449	I love Trader Joe's.
8680489	8680929	I really do.
8681029	8682130	It's the best grocery store.
8682810	8683810	I'm saving this.
8684030	8687731	Also, lots of change on Twitter.
8688292	8690692	I have not recognized that name as a tweeter in the past.
8690852	8692193	So happy tweeting to you.
8692913	8694854	What's your favorite game with Batman?
8698260	8699920	Well, that kind of narrows it down.
8701101	8702861	It was that one game with Batman.
8704542	8706102	I would have to go with Arkham Asylum.
8706822	8708103	Fuck you, I like Superman 64.
8708203	8712304	Is Batman even in that?
8713644	8716345	Hopefully DC Universe... It's a joke, Loki.
8716385	8718006	It's what we call a joke here on the show.
8718066	8724427	I thought it is a game that is in the DC Universe.
8724487	8726328	I thought that maybe Batman had a cameo in it.
8727968	8730970	I'm Batman and I declare that this game sucks!
8731271	8741238	To be honest, if it's not going to be DC Universe Online, which I'm really hoping, the old school one on the NES, the very first one by Sunsoft, the Batman game on the NES was pretty badass.
8741979	8746462	There was also one on the Commodore 64 that was told in a comic book style, also kind of badass.
8746802	8749824	Bart's Nightmare, but I guess that was Bartman, not Batman.
8750845	8751266	I'll take it.
8753467	8755168	Lots of change, we'll take it and he'll like it.
8756009	8756610	Tweet, tweet!
8757614	8759715	Alright, that's going to do it for the Twitter segment tonight.
8760235	8761036	That's all the tweets.
8780200	8781841	Stop being so fucking obscure.
8782041	8782421	All right.
8783341	8786862	I covered it on the classic game, Rob.
8787442	8791184	I'm sorry.
8792564	8794705	Stop sounding like a Japanese girl having sex.
8795665	8796125	That would be...
8799438	8801060	and now that the listeners are dead.
8801100	8804103	Wow, you do that impression way too well, I'm just saying.
8804123	8805765	I will tell you how I do it way too well.
8805785	8807707	Thank God your mic cut out, that's all I'm saying.
8808208	8809809	I will tell you how I know how to do that.
8809849	8815996	That comes from my dorm room with a group of us deciding to dub Rotsky Doji by ourselves.
8818338	8818739	Wow.
8819259	8822401	And every other line was, no, don't touch me there!
8823461	8834788	All I have to say is if we do get the cool 400th episode of The Pizza Place or wherever we have it where we get all the old school DDR people back, we need to bring in a copy of Final Fuck X. You know what, Rob?
8834908	8836009	I found that recently.
8836429	8837510	Or Dance Dance Fuck.
8838593	8840334	I don't remember where that is.
8840674	8845576	If we did do that at Mountain Mike's, they have a little side room too, so you could set up a TV in the side room.
8845756	8848858	Everybody stand to block the kids view.
8849198	8849738	Exactly.
8850118	8851439	I have to put a red door.
8853420	8854340	But I want to paint it black.
8854960	8864745	Hey, since Iguana Girl is here with us, I'm sorry, Iguana Girl is here with us, let's do a special... That's girl, not girl.
8877541	8878482	Your boyfriend's funny.
8880783	8881844	Let's do a game show.
8881924	8883085	Yay, an OLR game show.
8883125	8884206	We love game shows at OLR.
8884246	8885647	Game show!
8885907	8887429	This is one of the longest running game shows.
8887449	8888249	In fact, it's kind of funny.
8888309	8890051	I was hanging out with my friend Julie this week.
8890091	8890831	I've known her for years.
8890851	8891732	She's my ex-girlfriend.
8891752	8892833	I've known her for years.
8893273	8894314	I remember just after that.
8894394	8894554	Yes.
8895395	8897396	Julie... I remember when you were straight.
8897617	8901380	Used to be... I'm one of the only people that can say that, too.
8902060	8903901	You were around during my bi-phase, actually.
8903921	8904222	Yes!
8904582	8905102	Alright, anyhow.
8906343	8907764	All that stuff aside, quickly.
8909045	8913168	Julie actually used to help me host the radio show I did in college.
8913948	8916370	And this is a segment we started then.
8916830	8919732	And it's carried over all the way until now.
8919812	8920693	It's a segment we call...
8921033	8921953	Listless!
8922694	8923134	Yay.
8923594	8929937	And tonight's listless topic is the thing I learned most from DDR Freak.
8930578	8930878	All right.
8931318	8932879	The thing I learned most from DDR Freak.
8933299	8938641	And the way listless works is we're going to go around the room and we're going to get everybody's top three answers.
8939422	8944504	But then we go around and each strike one item that is not worthy of the list.
8945505	8947386	And then you guys in our chat room vote.
8948426	8954629	and the top three is the definitive winner and there is no contesting the list once it is set in stone.
8954669	8958410	This is a very, it's a highly scientific process.
8958810	8960911	It's made with uranium and shit, okay?
8961291	8962452	That's how scientific this is.
8963592	8965153	It's made with uranium and shit.
8965253	8965833	And Uranus.
8966614	8970055	Wouldn't uranium and shit just make a big, huge, bussy puddle?

8977526	8984407	Great, my boyfriend's asking in chat, what the fuck was Rob's bi-phase in an episode of Melrose Place?
8986328	8993789	Funny enough, a place I used to live was referred to as Melrose Place now, and I know that.
8993910	8995070	I know where that was!

9000071	9000651	Alright, anyhow.
9002749	9006292	Let's move on and talk about other topics, please, quickly.

9008113	9010895	Oh, no, I just love bringing up old dramas like 10 years old.
9010976	9011296	All right.
