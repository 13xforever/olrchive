Everybody, it's Rob Roberts again here at E3 for a little special show for our feed here.
Rob Roberts and pals at E3.
It's the Wednesday edition or the second day of E3, although that's somewhat of a fib because it's technically Thursday right now as we tape this.
It's after 1230 in the morning, so it's even later than we taped last night.
But you'll notice my voice at least is doing a little better today, so that's a good thing.
So I hopefully won't be straining as bad as I was yesterday.
Anyhow, let's get right into the show and kind of talk about some of the things we saw today.
You know, we don't have a lot of news for you guys or anything, because I'm sure a lot of you guys have been reading the different websites.
We talked a lot about what the press conferences were all about yesterday.
But we just kind of want to tell you about our perspective on some of the things we've tried and
and some of the things we got our hands on.
I know a lot of our listeners have come to kind of want to know what we think of some of the games we get to get our hands on.
So I'll tell you a little bit about my experience in a little bit, but we want to catch up with definitely a pal of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody who's been a supporter of our show for a very long time.
We try to support him too.
The one and only, straight out of Atlanta, Bobby Blackwolf is here.
Woo!
That's me.
How you doing?
So, um, I wasn't able to be a part of the show last night because I was getting drunk and attempting to rickroll the entire Bethesda party and failed.
It was very terrible.
It was the low point of my E3 when they turned off the karaoke at 1am and I was one song away from rickrolling everybody.
That's my biggest disappointment of E3.
I do have to throw this in, though.
He may not have gotten to Rickroll everybody, but if you do want to see his awesome Night of Fire routine, it's all over Twitter right now, so check that out.
Yeah, we're getting to that.
I do want to say that I was a part of the Activision saying, hey, we didn't have to pay that bonus to Infinity Ward, let's throw a party event.
Which was, you've probably read about it and seen it, it's the six million dollar party they threw in the Staples Center on Monday night, showcasing just four games.
DJ Hero 2, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, True Crime Hong Kong, and Call of Duty Black Ops.
with some cheap performers like Usher and Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden and this guy named Eminem with Rihanna and a stripper.
I love Eminems.
Yes.
I only want the red and black ones.
But the highlight obviously was the pole dancer.
I'm not going to say stripper because she didn't strip.
But the pole dancer, they lowered a pole from the rafters of the Staples Center.
and she literally went probably about halfway up, which is like to the club seats on this pole and hanging upside down and all that stuff.
She stole the show.
So yeah, $6 million and on top of that, they gave us free beer.
Well, clearly they had to bring in a pole dancer because the video game industry is so dominated by women and gay men.
Exactly, but to me, to me, that was the biggest F you to the former Infinity Ward guys because that was probably their bonus that they spent.
But hey, let me tell you guys this, you have never witnessed a video game trailer until you see it with full pyrotechnics all around you, the Call of Duty trailer.
is the same one you've probably seen online except they decided that it was going to, instead of the music being canned, they actually did have a full orchestra down in the pit playing the music for the trailer because the conductor was up on stage.
And I'm like, what is he conducting?
Oh, there's an orchestra down there because I was far in the back.
and then like halfway through you know just one big pyrotechnic like with explosion on the screen pyrotechnics went around and I was like oh that's cool they did some pyrotechnics and then every explosion for the rest of the trailer had either pyrotechnics or firecrackers from the top and it was that that was the way to experience a trailer I'm still not gonna play Call of Duty Black Ops
Is it possible that maybe they didn't just do it as like kind of like, you know, spend all that bonus money that, you know, they were supposed to pay out, but that maybe they sold the booth on eBay as well?
Because I noticed their booth is nowhere to be found.
So I think maybe they sold all the parts of the booth and that maybe paid for like the Dom Perignon that Eminem needed backstage.
Probably.
They do have a presence.
I mean, they've got a place, they've got some meeting rooms.
Basically what they're doing is that, you know, by appointment you can go in and basically they have these little rooms where you get a 30 minute demo of the game and sometimes hands-on and that's where they're showing all their games.
But it's by appointment only and they like it a lot better because it's not as hectic and loud and stuff.
So I did get to actually go in and see Guitar Hero.
Warriors of Rock.
I have not been able to see Rock Band yet, so don't ask me which one's better.
But, you know, kind of going into games, and this was actually one of the most recent things I saw as well.
It's Guitar Hero, but they showed us the Quest Mode, which is not Career Mode, it's Quest Mode now.
And it actually brings a little bit of, you know, it
and so on.
where you can select a friend's score off of the leaderboard and then it will show you how close you are to his score.
And then you can send him a message on Xbox Live making fun of him because you just beat his score.
Will I be able to spam his Twitter and his Facebook and everything else too?
No, I think it is just OS.
They've said it was just OS messages.
So it's, you know, you receive an Xbox Live message, kind of like what I get from Spazinator in some games, that, you know, he beat my high score in something.
Or the ones I love is that, you know, so-and-so wants to play Modern Warfare 2 with you, and I'm like, okay, do you listen to OLR?
Like, I just, no disrespect to those games.
I understand why they have an audience and so forth, but
Dance Masters
from Konami, which broke my Kinect virginity.
Because unfortunately, see what I've been doing, I've been working with e3coverage.com and we do a lot of interviews and stuff.
So when we go into appointments, it's not really about, for Game Tactics, for Justin Lee, who's the editor of Game Tactics, it's not really about seeing the games, it's about getting the interviews.
So we had an hour long Microsoft appointment and didn't see a single game.
because they brought in, since it's also a Canadian site, they brought up the Xbox Live manager for Canada and we interviewed him, the hardware manager for Canada and basically a lot of general people about Xbox in Canada and that was the entire hour was standing up there so I didn't get to really play Kinect except in the Konami booth and I'm a C dancer, that's what it said.
Now one thing I do want to say about it is the menu system this is what kind of threw me a little bit there might be a learning curve for some people because in the menu system for at least Dance Masters which is a third-party game so maybe Microsoft has it better it's very sensitive to your movements so basically you do the minority report type of thing like you know let's what happened to us is you know selecting the difficulty level between light and standard and
and to hit okay in Dance Masters, you have to put your hand up and then to the right and then, you know, kind of to touch the okay thing that's at the top right of the screen.
Well, when I had done it, I had said, okay, we're going to do standard and
and when I moved my arm up, and it's kind of funny, I'm doing this hand motion, I know you can't see it, but it's so I can explain it.
You're supposed to move your hand up and then to the right.
Well, when I moved it up, I didn't exactly move it straight up.
I went a little bit to the right.
And as I did that, it moved down to light, but I had already started the motion of hitting okay.
So it's going to take a little bit of getting used to.
You have to be a little bit more precise than you think.
And they're going to sit there and say, there's no learning curve.
But I think there might be for some people.
Well, you know, I had a little hands-on time with Dance Masters today, too.
And, you know, I played a song on there, too, and was going through the menu.
What kind of threw me was that, you know, Natal is supposed to be this whole, you're just going to hold up your hand and wave it around.
And as you wave it around, you'll be able to select the songs or, you know, whatever it is, change the channels.
You know, but I found as I was going through this Dance Masters, it was like, okay, I'm
Um, to choose the number of players, you're going to kind of, you're going to put your hand up and then you're going to put it over to the right.
And then it was like, okay, it changed the difficulty.
You're going to kind of reach around to left.
It's like, you know, you put your right hand in, you put your right hand out.
Can I shake it all about?
Okay, do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around.
You know, it's like, oh my gosh, like maybe it's just, there's going to be a natural learning curve with all that stuff.
And I'm being a little harsh, but I was kind of like,
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember that, you know, where you have to, like, wave your hand over the circle and stuff, and yeah.
So, but that's the only Kinect experience I've had.
I'm probably not going to be able to see Kinectimals or any of the other stuff.
I did touch PlayStation Move.
You know there was a unfortunately we had to cancel our Sony appointment for another interview with an exec and so that's what so they canceled the Sony appointment but they do actually have some so some move games that are not required to stand in a three-hour line to get to so I play bowling
Brunswick Bowling and I will say that the controller actually feels good in your hand I mean it's it's you know it feels a little bit better than holding a Wii Remote to me but bowling and enemy it's it's it's kind of hard to see how more precise it is than like the Wii Remote when you're playing bowling because that's such like the simplistic version and the Wii does a very good job bowling already but no it was it was
It was really good to use, and there was rumble in the controller and everything.
So I really don't know what I can really say about it.
I didn't get to play the stuff they're really showing, because I'd have to wait in a three-hour line, and I just don't have three hours.
All right.
Well, I know Shane and I have a whole list of games we want to go over, but Bobby, between yesterday and today, are there any games that have caught your eye that you want to mention to the listenership right now?
Okay, so here's one that, now, gotta realize guys, before I say this, last year my second favorite game of show was Split Second.
And I'm not a fan of it now, now that it's out.
So take this with a grain of salt, because this might be another one.
Driver San Francisco, which was in Ubisoft, um, you know, yeah, the Driver games recently have been pretty bad, the ones that were by Atari, or were published by Atari.
but they've kind of gone back to the roots of the first Driver which was actually pretty good and the gameplay mechanic or gimmick or whatever you want to say in this was great.
Basically, the storyline for it really quick because it makes no sense.
They obviously made the storyline to fit the gimmick rather than making the gimmick fit the storyline is that the character you play is in a coma.
He doesn't realize he's in a coma, he just thinks he has superpowers but you're playing the entire game in his head.
and essentially he's learned that his superpower in this coma that's in his head is that he can jump, he can shift, that's the actual term in the game is shift, from car to car.
So you can be driving along in a car, hop out, but all you do is you hit the A button, it goes to an aerial view and a little, and like this white light of God or whatever and you can select another car, hit A and then you're immediately in that car driving around.
So, you basically can jump from car to car, and then in missions and stuff, the way you activate missions is you see a police chase in progress, you can activate that mission, you can either shift into the police car, or into the getaway car.
And you can complete the mission that way.
And you can even do stuff like, one of the missions I did had two cop cars chasing the runaway.
and I could switch between the two cop cars just with the press of a button.
And so if I kind of messed up with one and crashed into a wall, I could jump into the other one.
The AI would take over that car, get it back up, and you can do it that way.
And then what they said is, okay, you might not be able to catch them with the cop car, so you can shift out.
And there was a big rig about three blocks down.
I shifted into the big rig and did a head-on collision, and that completed the mission.
and they also said it's online and yes you can shift around online so it's like online races and stuff are going to change a lot with this because everybody's shifting into other cars and if you have enough they didn't say exactly like how you can build up the shift power or whatever but you could actually shift into one of the other people's cars and kick them out and they have to get another car so it's going to be interesting to see I mean it was a great demo just like Split Second was it's going to be interesting to see if it delivers in the final product
Alright, I have to admit, I've always had zero interest in the Driver series besides just kind of like making fun of Driver 3, but that whole kind of play mechanic sounds really interesting.
What about like maybe one other game that's kind of caught your attention over the past couple days?
Okay, well, basically, it's not really a game, but the 3DS.
I was able to go and get my hands on the 3DS, and as I've said on my show, I am one of the 15% of Americans that cannot see the 3D TV, I cannot see Avatar in 3D, basically it looks like a darker 2D to me.
It's because of my eye problems, I had eye surgery when I was 3, so my doctor knows about it, and there's really not much we can do about it.
That being said, if I turn the slider on the 3DS all the way up and hold it at an extremely specific angle, I can see 3D in the 3DS.
I can actually see it.
They had a trailer of Metal Gear Solid, or the Metal Gear game that's going to be on the 3DS, and I was flinching as some of the things were flying at me.
Now, the problem with this is that that's great for trailers, or watching a movie or whatever.
I tried to play Star Fox on it in 3D, and I realized how much I move the unit when I'm playing.
If I move it any little bit, it starts getting to be double images, because basically it's prisms and stuff.
So essentially what would happen is I would move it just a tiny bit, and then it would start seeing double images and stuff, so I'd just turn the slider down to 2D.
But it's still great in 2D, it's still a better looking system.
then the DS.
The graphics are improved even in 2D so I might not be playing the 3D stuff all that much but the 3D actually does work with my eyes whereas Avatar in the movie theater and you know my dad's new Panasonic 3D TV with I took my PS3 over I couldn't see the 3D my parents thought it was amazing so Nintendo got you there.
That's pretty cool, though, because you must have had that moment of like, whoa, because I think when everybody sees the 3DS for the first time, and we talked about this somewhat extensively yesterday, but just to kind of recap, I kind of said, okay, yeah, it's a little gimmicky, but it's a damn impressive gimmick, and it definitely has the games to back it up, and you go back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and you know there's tons of great games coming out for this thing, and graphically it's an upgrade, but all gimmicks, so and so aside,
There's still that moment when you first see it where you're just kind of like, whoa, it really is kind of 3D and I'm not wearing glasses.
That's kind of cool.
I mean, surely you probably had kind of that similar thing, but even probably like double or triple so because you probably were very skeptical about it.
Well, actually, the first time I tried it,
I was looking at the Resident Evil trailer and I didn't really know how the system worked so I was just kind of sitting there looking at it and I'm like, yeah, I don't see the 3D because they actually have these women behind each system to kind of talk you through it.
And I couldn't see it in the Resident Evil because it was all double vision.
I didn't know about having to tilt the angle vertically, kind of.
I kind of had to tilt the screen to be a specific... And it's different for everybody's eyes.
And they didn't tell me that, so I was just like, I can't see the 3D, it's all just double images to me.
and then I went over back to our PR rep and I was like yeah I didn't see it and they're like well try this because the Metal Gear trailer was more popping than the Resident Evil one it was more extreme and one of the girls behind there said I'm blind in my left eye and I can see the 3D in this and so she trained me
and said you should try tilting it this way and doing that and then basically it was right at the beginning of the Metal Gear trailer there's the Kojima Studios logo and it flies at you.
That was my flinch holy shit moment was the Kojima Studios logo flying at me because I had finally gotten it right at the right angle and the woman who she was very nice but she said yeah I'm blind in my left eye but I can still see this and she kind of helped me get it to the right area.
I'm almost blown away, but that is amazing.
She's blind in one eye and she can see it.
That is a trip.
That is very, very cool.
Well, Bobby, if you don't mind, I'm going to spend some time with Shane talking about what we talked about today, but we'll come back to you a little later, see if there's anything you want to add.
If you want to jump in, just let me know.
We only have kind of one mic we're passing around here, you know, very ghetto, little portable kit.
So again, if the sound quality is bugging you, I apologize.
This is much, much different than the usual Sunday setup with a DarkSakura and Loki.
I do really, really want to make sure I do plug the one and only Bobby Blackwolf show, though.
I'm sure most people that are actually taking the time to listen this far into this already know about his show, but if you don't, he's on right before us, live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
Check it out.
Miklatov, Shane, how you doing?
Barely awake.
Well, I'm sorry.
I know we're keeping you up very late, but did you have a good day at E3 today?
Yeah, despite the fact that it wasn't the day we played the 3DS, I think today was a little bit more fun, so that's how E3 should go, I guess.
Alright, well Shane and I kind of made a list of everything we either kind of spent a long time looking at and got a tour through, or we actually got some hands-on time and played, so you want to go through this list a little bit, Shane?
Let's start off with a game that kind of really...
surprised me with how much I liked it.
DC Universe.
What did you think about DC Universe, Shane?
It was actually very fun.
The thing with DC Universe that I was skeptical about is it's yet another superhero MMO.
There seems to be a whole lot of those out there these days, but this one was more action and you don't really find that in MMOs.
It's still the same sort of World of Warcraft style.
You target an enemy and then you stand around and you hit a button and then you attack and then you wait
and then you attack again.
This one, I was flying around, running around, jumping, bashing things in the head, freezing them.
It was really fun.
Yeah, I love the fact that it was a little more action-based and the demo we got to play was a PvP demo and it was really cool.
The guy that was demoing it was showing us all these tricks and
I gotta say, you know, it was kind of like Phantasy Star Online, but on speed, to me.
Because, like, when I think action MMOs, like, there's not a lot I've really played except for Phantasy Star, you know, Online and Phantasy Star Universe.
But it was kind of like that, but really fast-paced.
And then kind of with that Warcraft twist, where you do have, you know, bars full of spells and things that you could use.
So I'm curious to see kind of what the single-player mode looks like.
I will tell you one little tidbit we picked up on, though.
I don't know if this is out there completely yet, but the PlayStation 3 and the PC versions...
are not going to play together.
Like a lot of people speculated, they will, at least initially.
I get the feeling from the little demo we had that that's something that they might want to try to add in later.
I think the developers kind of think they can pull it off, but I think it's also kind of like, I guess they have other balancing things because it's two different systems or what have you.
So if one of you was going to get that on PS3 and the other was on PC, do note you can't play together right off the bat.
So I think that's something
A lot of folks are going to want to take into consideration, yeah?
So, cool, DC Universe.
When's that out?
That was out, what, November 2nd, I think they said?
All right, how about Dead Rising 2, Shane?
Let me preface this with I am scared to death of zombies and the like, and I decided to, you know, face my fears, play some Dead Rising 2.
The game is really fun, very hilarious.
What's his name?
Chuck Green, I think, is the main character you play as.
Definitely dressed him up in some women's clothing.
I had a really good time.
I actually think I want to get this game now too.
I gotta admit, it did look a little more of the same with the first one to me, but upgraded in the way that sequels should be upgraded.
It was a little more camp in some ways, which I think is what everybody really appreciated about the first game.
The main character that they have now definitely seemed likable enough.
I think people are going to get a kick out of the environment especially.
I think the whole Vegas-y, Fortune City or whatever they're calling it, the Vegas-like environment, I think a lot of people are really going to get a kick out of.
LittleBigPlanet2.
Shane, tell them a little bit about what we did in that game, LittleBigPlanet2.
The level they gave us was somewhat of a race level, trying to reach the top before the time limit.
We failed, but it still let us keep going.
I can't remember a game that had made me smile and laugh so much while I was playing.
It's really got a charm about it that just makes you want to play more, which sucked because the demo, to me, felt so short, but I know we were playing that thing for like five minutes at least.
Yeah, I think one important thing to note is that, you know, it really did kind of just look and felt like the first game, you know, speaking of kind of, you know, games that are more of the same.
But you guys all know that the big innovation in LittleBigPlanet 2 is kind of what they're letting you do now, you know, the expansion of the creation engine, which is, you know, really the biggest part.
And the part Shane left out about the race is it was all about grappling hooks.
And the part of what made it really funny is that, you know, if Shane would be kind of like trying to grab onto something, I could actually use my grappling hook to grab onto him.
And it was kind of like the physics was really good, I thought.
And that was, you know, kind of the impressive part of the demo is that they got the physics kind of of all that complicated grappling and grappling that type of stuff down.
So, good times.
So, LittleBigPlanet 2, I mean, I think a lot of you guys that liked the first one were probably already going to check that out, and rightfully so.
Tron, I played the new Tron game, Tron Evolution, I believe it's called, on the 360.
Actually, the version I played is the PS3, but, you know, same, same.
Okay, guys, it's Tron meets Prince of Persia.
Like, that's really what it felt like to me.
You have the running up and wall jumping that you do, and, like, seriously, the tutorial stage felt almost just like that first Prince of Persia tutorial stage.
The battle mechanics, though, of course, are a lot different because, you know, you're not really using a sword.
The battle almost felt a little more like Bayonetta to me because, like, I could just practically button mash and do all this cool shit, and there was, like, bullet time and all this, you know, kind of crazy stuff.
The graphics were simple, but that's what Tron's supposed to be.
It's very true to the movie.
It was kind of hard for me to hear in the tunnel that they had Tron in this big neon kind of tunnel looking thing.
It was a very, very cool setup.
Props to them, whoever designed that booth.
It's very loud in there, but it sounded like the music I could hear was kind of a repeat of the Daft Punk score that's supposed to be in the movie, and the music sounded like it was really good.
Again, I'm kind of evaluating that on a very quick demo and what I think I heard, but hopefully a lot of the cool score will carry over.
I did have fun with it.
I thought for an action-y game, it was a pretty cool little button masher and it's Tron.
Now, Shane, you don't even know the Tron movie or what have you, so did this game do anything for you?
I know you just watch me play, but...
Um, to be honest, not really.
It seemed really bland.
The graphics weren't that great, especially considering the Wii one was right next to it, and it's kind of hard to tell the difference between the two.
And the environments were just really, really dull.
It was a whole bunch of black.
Blue, which, shockingly, you know, you'd think I'd like, but it was just, I don't know, it didn't look like a lot of effort had been put into making the game.
But that also might be the way the Tron series is, but that doesn't translate well for a big, flashy video game.
Now, see, I could tell the difference right away between the Xbox and the Wii one.
Well, for one, the Wii was all the light cycle racing, and I guess there's some of that in the 360 and PS3 one as well, but I don't know.
It definitely looks sharper to me, and I don't know.
I don't know what Shane's smoking.
I think it'll look fine.
But I guess, you know, if you don't know Tron at home listening, then you're probably going to kind of look at this the same way.
But for those of you that are fans of Tron, like me, you're going to go like, oh, that's cool, because you're throwing discs all over and doing these hops and bullet times and woo, special effects.
Epic Mickey.
We kind of had to watch one of the Disney employees play this, but we definitely saw quite a bit of this game.
Shane, what did you think of Epic Mickey?
It looked like a really solid platformer style game.
I think the thing that interests me the most, which is the one thing we didn't get to see a lot of, was the ability to erase and regenerate certain aspects of stages.
I did like the almost free-roaming little Tiki Hut section.
The 2D was okay, I think that was probably my least favorite, but it looked like a pretty interesting game.
I personally thought the 2D stuff looked kind of cool.
It kind of looked like what maybe you'd see on an Xbox Live arcade game or something, which was something because the graphics on the Wii were really good.
Bobby wants to jump in on Epic Mickey.
Because I played it.
Oh yeah, that's right, Mickey is epic.
I didn't play any of the 2D stages.
I played because there was another guy that was there that did the first part of the demo and I'm like,
I'll just continue from here because he had to run.
But I battled some enemies and stuff.
Mickey can't directly hurt the enemies, really.
Basically, you've got your paint and your thinner.
and you basically, if you throw enough paint at an enemy, it becomes your friend and starts fighting for you, kinda like minions in Overlord and stuff.
And I think if you do enough thinner at them, then they go away.
and stuff but there's actually some other things you can pick up like one of the things that I did was pick up like a special item that was a TV and in order to distract the guard you threw the TV at him and so he sits on his bucket and starts watching Steamboat Willie on the TV and then you can get around him and then basically take him out because there's this boat that needs to be risen and so you need to get rid of the anchors that are holding it down and with the thinner but you need to get in there and so there's some puzzle elements and
and then the boss, it wasn't really a boss but it was a harder enemy, essentially it has a can of paint in it and it paints its own shell.
So basically you fire paint at it to slow it down and then you fire thinner at it to get rid of its shell and then he's got a weak spot that you hit for massive damage.
And if you hit this weak spot three times then you beat him.
And you can also have other of your friend's
Help them and if you actually turn somebody to your side that has a can of thinner on them then they will, if they're your friend, they will throw thinner on the enemies and hurt them and stuff.
So it was really neat the way that they did it and it looks really good.
It's very smooth and stuff and it's still an early build.
but I had a lot of fun with it and it looks like they are because the guy told me Warren Spector is a huge Disney fanatic especially of the older stuff which is why you know the Steamboat Willie stuff is in there so he's really big on capturing the essence of Disney you know what really surprised me though just you know not knowing the old Disney as well as you know the contemporary stuff I was really surprised at how devious they let Mickey be in some parts like I don't know if you saw the part with the tiki masks
But in the very beginning, you know, there's a little quest that Mickey's given to go get Tiki masks.
And what he can do, he can go get the three masks and turn them in to the shopkeeper and, you know, the shopkeeper will reward him.
Or what you can do, you find one mask, you give it to the shopkeeper, and then the shopkeeper puts it in the back.
Well, if you go walk around to the back of the building, use paint thinner on the building, you can walk in the back door, take that mask, go back out and give it back to him and say, I found another mask.
And I was kind of like, that, it just kind of struck me as odd.
I was always kind of like, I would have thought that, you know, Vaughn Disney would never let folks kind of portray Mickey in a negative light like that.
And his conscience or whatever, Gus or whatever that's kind of following around is like, wow, I'm surprised you do that, Mickey.
But it kind of makes him more bad.
and you could kind of see that because his paint would be wearing off and that's why he kind of has that drippy look is because he had paint thinner.
So I was kind of surprised that you could kind of play it a little devious that Mickey didn't necessarily have to be all good.
I thought to me that's the most fascinating part of Epic Mickey is the fact that
Super Scribblenauts and The New Professor Layton
Yeah, to be honest, I was not going to play Super Scribblenauts.
It was an accident, thinking I was going to go play a different game.
But I'm glad I did, because I somewhat liked the first Scribblenauts game.
Like everyone, I had a problem with the controls, and I always relied on anvils and...
LaserGuns to get through all the stages, but the nice lady at the demo station was showing me just some of the stuff I could do.
She was like, put whatever you want.
I was like, well, I don't know what to put.
She's like, well, try, you know, big, purple, pregnant dragon.
I'm like, that's ridiculous, so okay.
And sure enough,
Big Dragon comes out, has a little baby dragon.
And I'm like, what the crap?
And she's like, OK, go back and put Friendly in there somewhere.
So I did that.
And then the dragons fought each other.
I was like, OK, that's pretty cool.
So with the controls being vastly improved and the inclusion of adjectives, it actually looks like a really, really fun game.
The other game I played was Professor Layton Unwound Future or something like that.
I don't remember exactly what it's called.
Newest Professor Layton game that's coming out this September apparently.
It's Professor Layton.
That's all you really need to know.
It's fun.
The one puzzle I did kind of stumped me a little bit and then the rep helped me out so I felt really dumb because I actually had it figured out.
I just was too chicken to pick the wrong answer.
I guess there's a new inclusion to the memo function when you're in a puzzle.
You can actually draw in different colors and you can erase with an erase tool instead of just clearing the entire thing, which is very handy.
Both of those games, once again, I'm looking forward to.
I definitely will get Professor Layton.
Scribblenauts is now on my list of things I definitely will consider getting.
Since I gotta step it up and get through the rest of these games faster so we can actually get to bed, do you want to describe Ghost Trick real quick too?
I know this is from the guy who did Phoenix Wright?
Yeah, it's a game where you're a ghost and you have to manipulate objects to alter characters' destiny, not destiny, fate.
Yeah, their fate, because usually the characters die.
At least they did in the demo.
It's more puzzle than anything else.
Really interesting graphic style.
The demo stumped me.
I kind of think I'm going to go back at some point tomorrow and try to beat it.
But it looks like another kind of brain teaser with lots of thinking involved from the same people that did Phoenix Wright.
um while he was playing some of those games I actually checked out GoldenEye uh the new GoldenEye game is actually on the floor it's kind of hard to find because Activision doesn't have a booth but Nintendo has it at their booth just only in a couple places um and I gotta fess up guys if you've listened to LR a long time you may already know this but uh I never really played GoldenEye 64 I just you know I didn't really have a Nintendo 64 until very late so I never really got into the craze until kind of a little later um so playing this on the Wii it was cool because it kind of you know
Old School Arcade Shooters
But, you know, very interesting that Activision is kind of taking this over now.
I know you only saw the game briefly, Shane Goldeneye, but did you notice anything lost in translation or anything?
I mean, to me, it made a very seamless transition from being a rare game to, you know, whoever's developing it now.
The only thing I noticed besides graphics that was a bit different, and this could just be my memory being a little bit hazy, but I do not remember the ability to climb on boxes and stuff like that, which was present in the demo we played.
But otherwise, it looked like a pretty faithful port of the Nintendo 64 one with some updated features.
Yep.
I think there'll be a lot of people listening to this that are going to be into that.
Like, you know, I think about Bress Lowell and his love for Perfect Dark.
I think a game like this will be right up his alley.
Quickly talking about some of the other games, we quickly got to observe the Castlevania Xbox Live Arcade game, heavily influenced by Symphony of the Night.
Lots of zoom-ins and outs on kind of the different stages.
It looks like you have like 10 minutes to, and you can cooperatively or, you know, combatively, I guess you could say, against each other, kind of,
Go after the boss but these stages seem to be very large and you kind of make your way towards the boss.
There's only really one stage in the demo that we could see but it
It looked interesting.
I don't know.
I think because it's in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, it could be a lot of fun.
But it doesn't look like, and maybe I should have asked this, but it doesn't look like there's a lot of single player stuff.
Although I imagine there might be time trials, things of that nature.
I don't know.
We didn't get to dig too deep into this game.
But Shane, anything from your quick, quick impressions of the Castlevania Xbox Live game?
Harmony of Despair, I think it is?
I think it looks like crap.
I don't like the premise.
Graphically, they could have cleaned it up a little bit.
The guys we watched playing it clearly did not know what they were doing.
But the game also didn't seem to really give you much direction.
I don't know.
I don't think it's something that they should have attempted.
I might give it a shot later on but it definitely kind of has that Neo Geo effect with all the zoom ins and outs but I thought it looked good and you know I'm a fan of anything inspired by Symphony of the Night so I don't know Shane you might want to give it a chance later here's a game I'm giving no chance at all Saw 2 god I watched Shane play the demo and like okay if you're eating something you might want to pause this for a minute okay okay so like in the very opening scene of the demo it's I think parodying a scene in the second movie I've never seen it but I've
I've heard about it where like the guy has to basically like cut open his eye or whatever.
Oh God, it's so gross.
And like you actually have to, what were you doing that with a controller?
Like actually like cutting the eye?
And it was like, oh, this is so disgusting.
Shane, you described the demos.
Um, I had said when I saw the Saw 2 game, I did not want to play the part where you cut open your eye.
And of course, that's the first thing you do in the game, so I had to do it.
Grossed me the heck out.
But, much like the first Saw game, the game is really about puzzles and trying to figure out stuff.
and I love it.
It's kind of my replacement or not my replacement but just something to get me through the time when we don't have Silent Hill because it is still kind of scary and it's got the nice atmosphere but it's very gory and if you are at all squeamish I saw so many
Different things die.
During the five minutes I played of the demo, only one of them was me, thankfully.
The rest were cut little flashbacks to people getting impaled, sliced with a buzzsaw, all sorts of fun things.
But yeah, it felt like a pretty good game again, and I cannot wait for it to come out.
But it is really gross.
That's the game I should show to my mother.
Be like, these are what video games are, Mom.
Don't you love these?
All right, how about... No, no, here's a game my mom would like, but I would never understand why.
Glee Karaoke Revolution.
Yeah.
Okay, here's the thing, guys.
Basically, it's Karaoke Revolution.
It's the little bars along the bottom that move with the pitch.
And it's just all the videos are Glee.
So there's really no interface whatsoever.
In the game itself, besides just the little pitch bars and a very, very light shell around that, there's no characters anymore.
As soon as you remember in Karaoke Revolution, you'd have these venues and things.
Nope, you don't really have that anymore.
It's just videos from Glee that only kind of go with the songs because they'll try to show it synced up with how it was in the show, but since the songs in the show are shorter, they'll just throw in all these random clips.
And it was on the Wii, the version we were playing, so the video...
Quality was kind of poop.
Like, you know, I watched Glee in HD at home, you know, when I was watching the first few episodes, and I don't know, I just thought the game was just kind of... I was barely singing the song, and I got like five stars.
Now, granted, I was on the lowest difficulty, and it's probably dumbed down because it was a demo, blah, blah, blah.
But I just, I don't know.
You know, I guess for the hardcore Glee fans, they'll be all over it, but I just thought it was...
It's kind of one of those things where as you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy, it starts to wear down a little bit, and that's kind of where I was at with Glee Karaoke Revolution.
I mean, it's a cute license idea.
I mean, it's kind of one of those things where once we saw it, it's like, oh yeah, of course, of course there was going to be a Glee game.
Shane, were your thoughts different?
Nope, I also thought it was pretty terrible.
My problem with it is, and this is the same thing that's happened before, is that Konami buys rights to a very, very popular IP and then does not put any effort into it thinking that the brand name will sell itself.
Unfortunately, as we learned with the American Idol Karaoke Revolution games, that's not going to work.
And this is a very, very good opportunity to make some money, but I just need to invest a little more because right now I don't see any potential in the game.
The sad thing is, though, Shane, I think it's going to sell very well because I think there'll be a lot of teenage girls that are like, I love Glee, and they'll buy the game on the Wii, and they don't look for the same stuff we do.
So I think you kind of have to take Shane and I's impressions of the game with a big grain of salt.
I think the game will still do really well.
It's just not going to do well with people listening to or recording video game podcasts about other types of games.
You know what I mean?
There's an audience for this that's just not us.
Well, as someone who is a huge fan of Glee and has bought all five CDs, on the day they came out, no less, each one of them, all I would need is just a few minor tweaks to the interface, and I would actually be fine with, for the most part, what we saw.
It just doesn't feel like it's anywhere near done.
I actually hope that's the case.
Alright, just a couple quick ones.
We'll kind of wrap up talking about what was at Sega's booth and some of the things we saw there.
Sonic 4, Episode 1, I think it's pretty much what all of you are expecting.
It looks like the old Sonic games, but with HD graphics.
That's really what it is.
I mean, what else can you say about it?
Either you've played the old games or you haven't.
I don't know, did you notice any minor tweaks that I might be overlooking, Shane?
When I played it, it really did feel like Sonic.
His animations are a little slow at the moment, but I overheard them saying that they were going to fix that.
The boss fight felt a little more complex than what I was used to from a Sonic game of that quality.
So I'm pleased.
I can't wait for it to come out.
You know, I also overheard them talk about, you know, well, we had to kind of take all this into evaluation and listen to the fans.
And they wanted Sonic to be able to accelerate faster from, you know, walking to, you know, running and, you know, all that stuff.
And I was just kind of like, okay, yeah, that's great.
But I think on most people, sadly, that type of effort will probably be lost.
Because I think a lot of people are going to have that same type of reaction where it's like, oh, hey, it's Sonic 2 but HD.
But that's not a bad thing.
You know, the old Sonic games were when they were really the best.
Um, alright, Phantasy Star Portable 2, I, I don't know, it was pretty much just like the first one to me, I didn't get to ask a lot of questions on that, I really wanted to see if the pizza box was still there, but, uh, I don't know, Shane, did you notice anything different, really?
Except not being able to skip cutscenes.
The only addition that they've really made, it seems, is the ability to roll around and dodge.
Which, you know, if you were like me and downloaded the Japanese trial, you already knew that.
Otherwise, it's pretty much the same game.
From what I understand, they had somewhat famous, I think, manga or anime artists in Japan do the new character designs.
They need to never do that again.
Because they've made the characters worse looking.
Aren't a lot of the characters just kind of copied from old games?
Because I swear that shark you were fighting in the very beginning was like the same damn thing that was in the Dreamcast PSO.
Those are completely different.
I'm talking about the characters you can create yourself.
They changed the faces, they changed the costumes.
It doesn't look nearly as good, I think.
Really, your character looked kind of cool to me, at least the one I saw.
I didn't think it was terrible.
After spending a lot of time with the character creator in the first game...
To me, I noticed how bad... It's really the faces.
The faces look really terrible.
Alright, I guess we'll close out today with a game I know Bobby had wanted to say something to on at some point.
This is also at Sega's booth.
But Sega was also showing off some iPads.
And one of the iPads had Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad.
So I know I think all of us got a chance to touch that game.
Shane, we'll start with you.
What did you think of Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad?
The theme for tonight is, I guess, I hated it.
It just controlled like crap.
Seriously, my phone, my iPhone plays Monkey Ball better than that iPad demo that they had.
So I'm not impressed.
Not making me want to buy an iPad.
Not making me want to download another Monkey Ball game.
Bobby, was the demo lost on you too?
It's shit.
You know, I got the controls pretty quick.
It's just that little device was calibrated weird.
But at the end of the day, I was like, yeah, Monkey Ball was better a long time ago.
I think this one's going to be a pass.
So there you go.
I guess we're going to go ahead and kind of wrap up for the night because I think we're ready to go to bed.
God, it's like already 1.30 and I still got to get this uploaded.
But thanks for staying up with us or whatever time of day it is where you are and listening to the little wrap up today.
We'll probably do another quick one tomorrow.
Probably won't be super long because I know Bobby's got to fly out to Atlanta and all that stuff.
But tomorrow we'll try to give you some final impressions, kind of like our most favorite thing we've seen at the show we'll get to tomorrow.
and I know we're going to be seeing Final Fantasy XIV tomorrow.
I'm really hoping to make it to Civ V. Actually, I'm supposed to have some time to sit down with Civilization V. It's actually exciting.
I know Bobby is going to finally get to see Rock Band 3 tomorrow.
So we'll have more stuff to talk about tomorrow.
Again, if you have questions, feedback, whatever, Twitter's the best way to get us on the show floor.
I actually did get some requests to see things today.
that I took pictures of.
There was NHL 11, Kirby's Epic Yarn I need to get tomorrow again.
I already put one picture up, but somebody wanted to know more about it, so I'll try to get that for impressions tomorrow.
I'm seeing the stuff on Twitter, guys, so keep sending those.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Any closing thoughts for the night, Bobby?
Monkey ball on iPad is shit.
Sounds good.
Any closing thoughts for tonight, Shane?
I can't wait to live at the Final Fantasy XIV booth tomorrow and never leave it alright guys and I guess my final thought is it is time to get this uploaded and go to bed and cheesecake is delicious just for the record it's very good have a good night everybody we'll see you tomorrow with another Rob Roberts special here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed good night
