Today, September 5th, 2010, the 360 is set to get a new controller.
News from PAX includes the return of a long-forgotten game franchise, and could comic books be coming to the PS3?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
And joining you over the next several, many, long hours, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes going by Sky in our chatroom and so forth.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm on podcast number two for the day.
I know, yes.
You're having quite the podcasting day, but we'll get to that in a minute.
Yeah.
But we also have to introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm good.
I made an observation this morning.
I was trying to confirm.
What is that?
I don't know if anybody remembers the guy, Reginald Vel Johnson.
You may remember him.
Was he the dad on Family Matters?
He was the dad on Family Matters.
Oh!
Dude, I'm a pop culture sponge.
Anyways, I was watching Ghostbusters today because they were playing it on Comedy Central, and he was a cop in that.
I'm like...
How many fucking movies and shows has he been a damn police officer in?
Because he's always a goddamn police officer in everything.
Quite a few, actually.
Die Hard 1, Die Hard 2, and Ghostbusters, as well as Family Matters.
And, of course, I'd have to go through the rest of these to figure out, you know, which ones of these.
He's actually a police officer, but it just has his name on there.
But it's just weird.
I know.
What has he done lately?
Can we get him on the show, maybe, to do some voiceovers?
He was also in Die Hard Vendetta, the video game.
Oh, bringing it back to games.
Love it.
All right.
Over the next many hours, we are going to be talking about video games.
We're actually having an early start, so we are live at All Games Radio.
We do tape live every Sunday at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, usually.
But today it's 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern, and we're starting to show a little bit early.
It's 10 o'clock in England.
Yeah, 10 at night.
So finally we're getting kind of an earlier show in for them, so I hope some folks overseas are listening too.
But we're going to actually try to go late tonight.
I don't know how late.
The goal is midnight tonight.
We might go longer.
We might go not as long.
I don't know.
But we'll see.
So we're doing the marathon episode.
Why?
Because we can.
Why not?
It's not a fundraiser for anything.
I mean, you should donate to charities.
Do good in your life.
But we're just doing this for fun because everybody else is at some freaking convention this weekend.
So we're having a little mini festival of our own.
We do have some guests joining us in studio here today.
I don't know how long they'll be with us.
I think he'll be with us the whole time.
Say hello to Salacious Pop or Alan.
Hello.
How are you?
Much better than last time.
Really?
What was wrong last time?
I had food poisoning when I was on the show.
Oh, that's right.
You were recovering from the Reno trip.
Yes.
But you're feeling much better today.
Yes.
All right.
Yeah, I was a little worried about that because we're doing this marathon today.
We didn't really plan it out very well.
It's just like, hey, let's broadcast for 12 hours.
Okay.
Oh, when are we going to eat?
So I don't know.
Hopefully Dan is going to be back at some point where we'll be able to kind of rotate in and out.
So learn with us here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
Just order a pizza.
Just put the pizza guy on the show.
Talk about games.
And he's like, I'm going to get fired.
Yeah.
You know what?
If it wasn't that Dan couldn't have the sodium, we could totally just do a take and bake.
Send Dan off to be our errand boy.
Yeah.
Good times.
Go to Papa Murphy's.
Good times.
Also joining us, say hello to Bradley, our KDN42.
You said there'd be surprises.
I'm the first one.
Woohoo!
How are you?
You were on the show a couple months ago, but before that you weren't on for a couple years.
I was on a few months ago, I don't remember.
I thought you were.
I think the last time I was on was at your house.
Oh, that was a while ago.
I thought for some reason.
Oh, well.
Whatever.
I think you maybe mentioned me because I was here for her party or something before that.
Nah, that might have been it.
That might have been it.
And then I just popped in the chat room like once or twice.
There you go.
Well, what's new with Bradley?
What are you up to?
Well, I haven't been playing any games this last week because I was on the road.
I did like a seven-day trip of National Parks.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Then the next one was Theodore Roosevelt, which I just kind of drove around.
And also the next day was Rocky Mountain, where you go up like 12,000 feet when you're driving.
Then Arches, which has all the natural arches in it.
And Canyonlands, which is a big canyon.
Also was, what's the next one after that?
Was Coral Reef, or Capital Reef.
Bradley, I'm thinking you should just be a park ranger.
Like, can't you see Bradley as a park ranger?
Like, I could totally see that.
He'd just be in his cabin during the winters with the Xbox and what have you.
Actually, let me give a little background on Orange Lingerie.
Since we have a lot of extra time today, I can kind of do that for the people who haven't listened in a very, or just now listening, or you haven't heard this story because you haven't told it in a long time.
Here's what Orange Lingerie is all about.
DarkSakura, Loki,
Thanks for watching!
DDR is still around, but the culture isn't quite the same as it used to be back in my day.
But we decided to start a show about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution and that whole scene.
And that's the way the show was for about the first, what, about three, four years we were doing that?
Then when podcasting came around, we got into doing that.
We used to do a spinoff show.
It was a spinoff show of our main show about just video games in general.
And then that kind of took off and ended up kind of taking over the DDR part when music games and so forth...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and all the ways you guys can interact with us and give us your opinion.
It's because we're technologically able.
We have the technology.
We can repair something.
Something, something.
All right.
So anyway, the reason why I give that background is that we all kind of bring different things to the table.
We all like different types of games.
For instance, DarkSakura, she does the classic game of the week here on the show every week because she has a vast brain full of useless video game trivia and these obscure-ass import games even I don't hear of ever, so...
That's kind of her background, right?
Is that kind of a fair assessment?
Yeah.
And then Loki, speaking of random trivia, he has been in nine different shows or series playing a law enforcement officer.
Granted, the one in Ghostbusters, he was a prison guard, but goddammit, that's close enough.
So, nine different series or movies.
Don't you have to be an officer to be a prison guard?
It's still a law enforcement job.
But yeah, that's a lot.
He's just really typecast.
Anyways, enough talking about him.
I'm not going to talk about him anymore.
Promise?
Promise.
You're going to have a good 12 hours to do so.
I know you're not staying the whole time.
Anyway, Loki is kind of... I see him as more of our tech, hack, crack...
If there's a way to break the game, he will, kind of guy.
He was the guy that probably bought a Game Genie as soon as they were out to see how he could screw up the game.
I bought one, though.
Would that be kind of a fair assessment of what you're all about?
I'm sure.
All right.
And then me, I don't know.
I grew up on Commodore 64 and all the old school games.
So I like to think of myself as kind of like a retro-y gamer as well.
But I like a lot of new stuff, too.
I think lately it's been MMOs.
I've played a lot of them.
and a lot of like computer games too.
I mean, not all of them, but I try to do them.
So I'm just kind of a little bit of everything.
And then the reason why I kind of lay all that out is I want to ask Bradley, what types of games do you bring?
What's your gaming background?
What are your likes and dislikes in gaming?
Thanks for watching!
Cool deal, cool deal.
I always think it's a bad idea when people go around saying, I hate all sports games, or I hate sports video games.
Sports video games are crap.
A lot of people on this show, it may not be the preference of the types of games we play most of the time, but I think it would be a lie to say I hate all sports games, because I
I love NBA Jam, and I love that it's coming back.
I have a way to make it very nice and simple for you.
It's just like racing games, how you have your arcade racing games, which are fun to play, and your simulation racing games, which require you to be able to drive and tune a car with the same precision that you would a real car.
You hate simulation sports games.
You do like arcade-style sports games, though.
That actually makes a lot of sense.
And then over there, those folks, usually it's like, oh, well, I hate all those Japanese RPGs.
There's too much of the same stuff.
But maybe I'll play Final Fantasy.
I'll play that one that is kind of out in the mainstream.
Or music games.
A lot of people are like, that arrow stomping?
No, what is that?
That Japanese rave-y techno music?
What is that?
What is that?
And I sort of see that as the hardcore music games, like Beatmania 2DX.
is a hardcore music game.
But I'm sure everybody has enjoyed Guitar Hero at least once, a rock band at a party, drunk, right?
So, you know, it's kind of interesting.
This ties into an email.
I don't recommend DDR drunk.
Well, it can be fun.
Until you hit your head.
Responsibly.
We had an email on the show last week that kind of got me thinking about all this, was the whole, like, my friend says I'm not a gamer because I don't play X, Y, and Z. Remember that?
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
It was kind of not because it's been a busy week for me.
I had school and I had my visit to the mikveh on Thursday.
My conversion went through.
I am now the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio.
Congrats!
Although SSJ100Matt is probably very upset about his title being stripped and his tiara.
I'm the host.
Okay, you guys can also be the official co-Jews.
Yes, they can be your... It says Yarmulke being stripped.
They can be your harem of Jews.
They can be my posse.
Alright, your posse.
Um, any, anyway, uh, my, my Chavra, that's it.
Anyway, um, so yeah, that happened, and it was really great, and then I had to go talk in front of people on Friday.
Um, but I, I played some Star Trek Online, and I had to go because Dan came home, and it was, I don't know, I just, I, I played a little bit, not a lot, just some, and so, oh, oh, oh, oh, my anniversary was on, um,
Wednesday, my fifth anniversary.
So Dan got me this instead of a rose.
Sims 3 Ambitions.
And isn't that much better than a rose?
Yeah, he also wrote me a note that said, in fact, here it is.
I'll put it up on the thing.
It's on my Facebook right now.
Sorry I didn't get you a rose.
I thought you would like this more.
I love you.
D. Aww.
I'll take a picture and put it on the thing.
That's sweet.
You should gush about him while he's not here to defend himself.
It's really cute.
He has to be a manly man when he's here on the show.
I wish Dan would stop believing his underwear in the hall.
Okay, let's move on to Loki.
How was your gaming week?
My gaming week was pretty slim.
I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned.
It's still fun.
And I played a few other things.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
so there's a few games on there that haven't really been leaked out for JTAG users and that kind of stuff so I got to play a few different Xbox Live Arcade games that aren't out yet um that are actually kind of cool so one of them that I played was um Bonk apparently they're remaking Bonk um from Bonk's Adventure the old TurboGrafx game and um
It's okay.
It's kind of done along the lines of how they did the Hudson Adventure Island remake.
It's okay, but the one thing that they kind of took out of it that really made Bonk Bonk is his giant head.
His head is now a little bit more proportioned to his body, which really sucks.
Because it has the same type of, like when you're climbing a wall before in Bonk's Adventure, he used to use his teeth.
Well, in this, he's still biting the wall, but he also looks like he's climbing, so it doesn't make any sense why he's biting the wall.
I don't remember a New Adventure Island game.
Was that on the Wii or something?
It was on the Wii.
Huh.
I think it was a WiiWare game.
Nice.
But it wasn't very good.
Oh, okay.
That's too bad.
And this one's kind of just okay, but I don't know.
It looks like it might be pretty fun.
I didn't play a whole lot of it, just a few levels, but...
It's alright.
I really wish they'd left this head.
They don't really have to change too much.
Just clean up the sprites a little bit and go from there.
The last Adventure Island game I remember playing that I just absolutely loved was Super Adventure Island on the Super Nintendo.
I don't know if you guys ever played this game.
I think one of the reasons I really loved that game was the soundtrack to that game was amazing.
Actraiser
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The version that they have on PartnerNet is broken.
It doesn't go past the main menu because you can move the cursor around on the menu, but no button that you press will actually allow you to start the game, which kind of sucked because I wanted to play that.
And then what else did I play?
There was one other game I played.
It was a dancing game that's coming out.
Actually, yeah, Dance It's Your Stage, which we'll be talking about coming out next week.
um, it's terrible, it's really, really bad, and I don't know, I'm not too familiar with the game itself, but I think, based off the music that I saw in there, and that guy looks like a total douche, um, I believe it's, um, it says it's a port of a German Wii game, I think it's based off of a
Yeah, it's based off of a TV show.
That's so strange that they're bringing it here then.
Does it have David Hasselhoff in it then that you can dance to?
No, but the music though in it is just not good.
That's really the only thing that kind of sucks.
The gameplay itself isn't very good either because it's got two kind of...
Thanks for watching!
and it gets really confusing when it's you know going really fast and then also the music's very very very very terrible so um I really don't recommend picking it up not that many people probably would have next week anyways but it is a terrible game very very very terrible game um is it bad?
it's very bad I wasn't sure it's terabad it's terabad terabad um
What else did I play?
Oh yeah, one other.
I played a cave shooter game, and I'm going to butcher the name.
I believe it was called Grungy or something like that.
I don't know.
It's just from memory there.
Anyways, it's your typical cave shooter games.
I guess it...
Awesome.
That was fun.
Alright, that it for Game of the Week?
That is it.
I'm going to be looking forward to your sneak peeks every week now of new stuff coming out until you get shut down.
Yeah, until the console gets banned off partner net.
Usually when they would ban the consoles, it's actually worse than if you got banned off live because when they ban your console, they blow all the e-fuses and it makes your console very...
Broken.
Wow.
That's kind of evil.
But the person that sold me the console took out the resistor that allows those e-fuses to be blown.
So if they ban me from PartnerNet, the console will be just fine.
That's like Mission Impossible, where it's like, this message will self-destruct in 30 seconds.
Yeah, but here's the thing.
It's...
If I got banned from PartnerNet, I probably wouldn't care because here I thought there was going to be actual beta tests of games and stuff like that.
That's not the case.
And I could definitely see why they don't do that because people would be leaking that crap left and right.
And even still with some of the arcade games, people leak them out there and that's got to suck for them.
But
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We'll start off tonight the marathon with a comment from Spazinator who is talking about the soundtracks because I was talking about Yuzo Koshiro a little bit ago says in my opinion the OSTs for Killer Instinct, Actraiser, Super Castlevania 4 and Mr. Bones have the best music.
Those are all some really good soundtracks although I don't know Mr. Bones.
What system was that on?
I don't know.
Cool, cool.
The Killer Cuts CD that you got when you pre-ordered Killer Instinct on SNES was amazing.
Yes, it was.
Hours and hours played in high school.
It wasn't necessarily a pre-order either.
I just went into Montgomery Wars back in the day and bought mine and I said, where's my CD?
Nice.
I would say one of my favorites was not actually from the game at all, but was the soundtrack to the Mortal Kombat motion picture because that CD was awesome.
Mortal Kombat, test your mind.
I have that song somewhere I'll have to play it on break.
All right.
Anyway, let's move on to My Gaming Week.
I'll talk quickly about this.
Now, was that the Mortal Kombat game soundtrack?
No, the actual movie soundtrack was awesome.
Yeah, the movie soundtrack was awesome, but remember the one that they did for the game?
Less awesome.
Oh, come on.
That was very awesome.
It was so awesome.
We used to play Keyzer, that soundtrack.
And Spazinator is clarifying in chat that Mr. Bones was a Sega Saturn game.
That was it.
I was thinking about the Ghosts and Goblins kind of game that was on.
Never mind.
Let's see.
We got a lot of other comments and chats here.
Sorry, I was going to add one more thing to my gaming week.
It's not really my gaming week yet, but it will be.
Unless you haven't read my Twitter, I will be getting an iPod Touch.
Now, I know what you're thinking.
This goes against my total hatred of Macs.
Wrong.
And really Apple in general.
Well, I've kind of gotten blinded by the whole hating Macs because iPods are not Macs.
iPods are their own thing.
Sure, rationalize it however you can, Loki.
It's the Backpedal Express.
To be fair, I didn't pay for this with my own money.
I think that's what it really is.
If he's being given them, how can he say no?
I mean, they are still great MP3 players and stuff.
No, I think they're decent MP3s.
Well, I don't really give a crap about playing MP3s, but... Oh, they're game systems now, too.
Really?
Yeah.
But, you know, if they gave me the gift card and said you have to spend it on a Mac computer, I think I'd have issues.
But I'm fine with the new iPod.
FarFantasy10 Soundtrack for the Win
Redertainment says the music from Brutal Legend was awesome.
Too bad they never released a formal original soundtrack for that game.
And then Cyber Beast, I love this, chimes in with Daytona.
You know what game actually had one of the little side soundtracks that they did?
It was Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon.
Those were both gorgeous arrangements of the music.
Was Prey the one that was all piano?
It was the ladies singing.
Okay.
Well, there's a third.
It had a lot that was on piano, but Celtic Moon was all the, you know, Celtic style.
Right, right.
Good stuff.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
We'll be keeping an eye on chat throughout the night.
Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
Amazatsuma says, Loki, your soul is mine.
Love, Steve Jobs.
There you go.
I had to spend the gift card on something.
It was either that or, like, a bunch of the nanos.
And what the hell would I do with a bunch of nanos or a bunch of the shuffles or whatever?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But what a lot of companies do sometimes is that if they're buying these cards in bulk, then there's a discount on them.
Like if a company buys $55 Starbucks cards to give away as an incentive, they might reduce the cost of that.
So that way they have no cash value.
They're not really gift cards.
They're like coupons.
And so then you can't do that.
So it really depends if someone paid full cash value up front or not.
Zeebo wants to know how you got the gift card.
What did you do?
Was it a present?
I don't know if you can talk about it.
No, I can talk about it.
It's not really anything I did.
It's actually what our video reps did.
Our video reps do sales incentives with Sony for various titles throughout the year.
We've gotten a bunch of things from Sony.
Thankfully, they do include us game reps even though we have nothing to do with this.
in on the, you know, little spiffs.
So, like, for example, we've gotten a Sony HDTV, we've gotten a surround sound system, a camcorder, and they got a PlayStation 3.
I wasn't included in that, but don't care, I already have one.
And then we're going to be getting, probably later on this year, a Sony-style card for $500.
So they actually gave us a $500 card for Apple.
T-ara suggested that you could buy a bunch of shuffles and throw them like ninja stars.
No, I decided, because I'm nice and a wonderful husband and stuff, I bought myself an iPod.
The new iPod Touch 8 gig.
One for myself and one for my wife.
To which she's like, what am I going to do with that?
I'm like, God, I should have just spent it... Put Bejeweled on it for her.
I was going... She doesn't care.
She's like, I can play Bejeweled online.
I'm like, well, you can browse the internet with that.
Well, can I just browse the internet anywhere or do I have to be on Wi-Fi?
Well, you have to be on Wi-Fi.
Well, that's stupid.
I'll just use my computer here.
Does Apple make diapers?
Because we could use those right now.
You should sell it and get the money so we can put it in our savings account.
That's always the answer for stuff.
So, you know, the next time when we get that Sony-style card, she isn't getting shit.
It's all mine.
Then again, though, I don't know what the hell I'd get from Sony-style for $500.
Nelly sounds like my mother.
It's just her Jewiness, I guess.
Oh, wait, wait.
DarkSakura can officially be offended by that now.
I don't care, I don't care
All right, let me talk about my gaming week.
My gaming week, I actually didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
Most of the same old, same old.
I will talk about one new thing I played.
I got to get a sneak peek at something just like Loki did.
I got to play World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the beta for that, at least for a little bit.
It worked for like a morning and then I couldn't get in all day yesterday.
So Alan watched me play this too.
It was cool.
I rolled a Worgen.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and when you collect the barrels then you have to walk up to the giant fat abomination creatures and you put the barrel on its head and then your character will yell fire and then the camera zooms back in a seamless motion and it goes back up to where you started the quest and there's a guy there with a gun and it shows him aiming it at the barrel and pulling the trigger and you watch the bullet fly with the camera and it hits the bullet and the abomination is saying something like uh oh me worried
and then the bullet hits the barrel which is filled with gunpowder and the dude explodes and chunks go everywhere.
It's awesome.
That sounds like fun.
It's getting hardcore.
I'm liking this stuff.
I didn't play the Goblin area yet but apparently they have a highway through the Goblin town and there's all these car racing Mario Kart type quests so they're getting crazy with all the different quests they have in the game.
I've heard it called Grand Theft Azura.
Really?
Because of all the little cars.
That's cool.
That's awesome.
The crack is saying your name, DarkSakura.
Actually, I was just thinking that something that would be fun is if I play Sims all throughout the show and have a house built by the end of the show.
If you want.
Or start it at 5.
I'll log into Star Trek Online.
No, I wouldn't do that.
Honestly, guys, I don't know what we're going to do once the regular show is over.
We're going to fill seven hours of radio somehow.
We'll figure out how we get there.
Worgan, Thumbs Up for Me
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Speaking of janky, did the Final Fantasy XI, or not XI, might as well be XI because it sucks.
Now, did the Final Fantasy XIV beta, the open beta start this week?
I don't remember.
Sort of, but a lot of people are having problems getting in.
I guess you have to actually register for the open beta, and they're only letting so many people in at a time.
Well, then that's a closed beta.
That's stupid.
I'm hearing they're having a lot of problems.
See, they're limiting the amount of people that can play the beta.
It's like the time, yeah.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah, that game's in a lot of trouble.
I'm worried.
They really, if they're smart, they're going to push back the release of that game and not try to release it.
But it might be too late now.
I don't know.
But also, speaking of release dates, playing this World of Warcraft beta got me thinking.
I don't think it's coming out this year.
Like, I know Blizzard has swore up and down that they're going to try and get it out this year.
If they make this year, mid-December is like the earliest you're going to see this game.
It'll be out before Christmas.
Yeah.
It's going to be mid-December then.
When you say before Christmas, you mean like two weeks before Christmas.
Before Christmas, because they've already sent out a map notice saying that their map stuff's ending on the 25th.
Really?
I feel like there's a lot left still.
of the beta process.
It doesn't really matter that they sent out that notice, but I'm just saying that right now, that's what they're saying is that it's going to be out before Christmas.
Well, they're probably waiting to announce the actual release date at BlizzCon, but I'm thinking mid-December because there's still all this stuff they've got to do.
They've got to do the actual patch for Cataclysm, which will probably be about three weeks before the game releases.
They've got to do the world event that leads up to the Cataclysm, which is another three weeks.
They've got to do one more patch still of the taking of Gnomeregan and Echo Islands.
That still has to happen too.
So there's still a good 10 weeks of plot content that has to happen before the game can come out.
So there's only so much time left.
So we'll see.
All right.
Let's move on to our guests and their gaming weeks.
Alan, how was your gaming week?
Pretty boring.
Same old, same old.
Maybe an hour or two of Zuma's Revenge.
Revisited that.
A lot of fun.
And then just a lot of WoW.
No real developments there.
What's your big WoW accomplishments lately?
I got enough rep with the oracles to buy their stupid egg that hatches once a week to try and get the mount from it.
That's about it.
Good times.
Very boring.
Yeah.
Good times.
All right.
Any other games that you like to play regularly outside of WoW just so the listeners don't think you play WoW all time all the day, although that may be what you actually do?
That's really it.
Come on.
Puzzle Quest 2, I've talked about that before.
Zuma's Revenge, like I just said.
I played Peggle on your phone, your new iPhone 4 that we got last week.
Peggle is crack.
Yeah, Peggle's really awesome.
All right.
Some of our listeners are saying the stream is skipping.
I don't know what's going on, but with a 12-hour show, I'm sure it's going to be a problem through a lot of it.
But just a reminder to everybody in studio, whatever bandwidth, you got to make sure.
I did forget to close my torrent, so I just closed it.
Uh-ohs.
Okay, there you go.
All right, maybe that'll help.
So we'll see.
If it still is skipping in about 10 minutes, I'll try rebooting the stream.
But meanwhile...
I think I kind of asked Bradley about his game of the week and he said he was doing mostly traveling, but I'll ask again if there's anything you want to throw out there, Bradley.
Okay, so there was no games this week, but I want to go with my last week because I was playing a bunch of games then.
I played Shadow Complex.
That's a fun game.
That was for last year's Summer Arcade.
I've actually bought all the ones for this year.
Nice.
Just mainly because I bought the four of them, so I bought Monday Night Combat as well.
I played through the demo, and it's a game I probably might play a little bit, but it's not one I'd play a lot because it's one of those team-based combat games I'm not big on.
Castlevania HD, I didn't play that last week, but I played through the game on that, and that's fun.
It's kind of one thing, as you said on one of the previous podcasts, was that...
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's how you do that one.
Let's see what the other games... Limbo, that one's actually a pretty cool game.
At least it's worth a play.
It might be a bit expensive for the $15 just because if the first playthrough of it, it only took me about three and a half hours, and if...
DarkSakura.com
Thanks for watching!
Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light?
Yeah, I did play that.
I played through the first four levels and that was pretty fun.
I haven't played the co-op because I haven't had a second person there to play it.
Sounds interesting from what you said last week.
Or two weeks ago, I think.
Yeah, I was definitely a fanboy for that game, I'm not even going to lie.
It was kind of one of those surprises.
I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.
I really wasn't, so it was cool.
I like the arcade feel of that game a lot.
It feels like playing Gauntlet, kind of.
Yeah, and I also played Burnout Revenge.
It's been like a year, almost nine or eight, ten months since I played it last, but I like the Burnout games as they're...
That's like arcade racing simulators, but arcade racing.
Just fun knocking people off the road and trying to get the thing.
Except for the burning laps and preview races where you have to beat a certain time are really annoying.
Because if you die, if you mess up one time, you have to restart the whole race and start over and over.
It takes like an hour to get a gold on it or a perfect rating on it.
All right.
Well, I guess that's going to do it for everybody's gaming weeks.
So, you all right over there?
Crash?
I just knocked my fork over.
Party foul.
It was my delicious food, which I'm not going to describe.
It's still very garlicky.
All right.
Nothing wrong with garlic.
Alright, let's move into some gaming news after we do some housekeeping tonight.
I don't have a whole lot to add other than we already talked about we're going to be going a long, long, long show tonight.
I'm trying to see if the skipping problem is resolved.
Looks like some people are saying, yeah, it's better.
Some are saying it's still going, so we'll see.
We'll give it a few more minutes to work itself out.
and otherwise I guess I'll say add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
If you follow us on there, we can give you updates so that you know if we're going to be doing a show early or whatever's going on.
Alright, let's get into some news.
Let's finally start talking some actual gaming news here today.
Big news out of Penny Arcade Expo, right Loki?
Oh yeah, this is kind of like...
Very surprising news, but I'm sure people are taking it with a grain of salt.
Duke Nukem Forever is coming out 2011 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
It is now being developed by Gearbox Software with the help of 2K Games.
and they are finishing what 3D Realms took over 10 years to start I guess and it was playable on the show floor and it's everything Duke Nukem should be you know with being able to pee everywhere and you know blowjob into windows and you know strippers are there strippers strippers punting eyeballs across you know a football field
Good stuff.
All right.
Here's where I want to start.
This is obviously, yay, funny gaming news.
You know, like, hooray, it's finally happening.
But at the same time, there's a part of me that goes, okay, well, look.
I don't think this is really the same game that Duke Nukem Forever was originally going to be.
And, you know, that might be kind of a duh because it's probably been like five different games over the past 13 years.
Oh, I'm sure more than that, yeah.
But I honestly think after the closure of 3D Realms, I think these guys probably got the IP and probably nuked everything that had happened before.
I mean, I know they say that they've taken what 3D Realms started or whatever, but I go...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Duke Nukem
This is a game where we cannot make a promise we cannot fulfill.
We need to get past the shock and awe and then we can go to all the retailers and first parties and work with our launch plan.
It will be coming out though.
I'm excited, I love the Duke Nukem games and to be honest, just from the screenshots and the little cam videos that they had of the gameplay it looks good, it looks like, you know, because I think they're really going to kind of keep the vibe of the old games in there and it's just going to be souped up now and Gearbox, you know, they've definitely got a good pedigree as far as first person shooters go so I'm pretty confident that they'll churn out a good game
Awesome.
Multiplayer.
They're not really showing a lot of that.
There will be good multiplayer though if Gearbox is involved.
I hope they do map editing and all that stuff.
I hope so too.
That would be awesome.
That was the most fun part of the original Duke Nukem was looking at all those custom maps that would come out for that.
Maybe the PC version, but I don't know about the 360 and PS3.
Parish the thought.
I don't know about that.
I know that's a topic near and dear to your heart, Alan, right?
Quaking with rage right now.
Yes.
Once Portal 2 is out, their next press release better have Half-Life in it.
Alright, we'll see.
All right, let's move on to another topic.
We'll know more about that game, I guess, closer to when it actually releases, which it sounds like is actually going to happen at some point.
Hooray.
Talking about another thing that's floating around out there.
I'm not sure if they're showing this at PAX, but I guess the news broke.
I actually heard about it thanks to the GameStop Managers Conference.
They were showing this, which was the week before PAX.
and I think a lot of the stuff that is at PAX now was probably at this conference like the week before but this was one of them and it has to do with the new Xbox 360 controller.
It's a redesign of the Xbox 360 wireless controller.
It's now going to be silver.
It kind of has this black, white, silver look to it with only the green being in the lights for the Xbox logo.
That's really the only place they are.
Otherwise, the other big change to this, a new D-pad.
Yay!
Finally, in America, they are fixing the D-pad.
But not only are they fixing it, it's really different.
What they're doing, it's a transforming D-pad.
What you can do, you can pop out the plus sign to have it just be the plus sign, or you can actually have a whole little like kind of...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, I already know the answer to that, so I can't say.
45.
45 says... About-ish.
About-ish.
Here's the thing.
It's $64.99 for this new controller.
You know why?
They're only selling it with the Play and Charge kit as a bundle.
And it's a limited edition.
And there's a part of me that kind of goes, like, looks at that and goes, you little shits.
Like, you know your controller is a problem.
You've known this for a long time.
You've fixed it with limited releases, like some sort of tease, like time again in Europe.
And now that you're finally releasing something kind of a step beyond that here, you're going to gouge for it when it's like a problem in the first place?
Like, you suck.
You're a dick, whoever thought of this.
I mean...
I like the look to the controller though, even though it is a little weird that the buttons are not that yellow, blue, red, green.
Yeah, that's going to be wonderful for, I don't know, players that are new and that they have color, you know, little...
Indicators and stuff on the screen that correspond to those buttons.
Oh, the buttons don't have colors because they're black and white.
Why did they do that?
That's just dumb.
The only way I would see that being acceptable is if they were backlit with those actual colors.
So it looks gray when it's turned off, but actually has colors shining through when you turn it on.
But that's not the case with this.
That's just them being dumb.
Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, I'm sure the only thing limited is the bundle and color.
They will continue with the new D-pad.
Hmm.
I hope you're right on that.
I don't know.
They haven't really said on that, though.
Maybe this is a trial thing?
This is a trick to get you to buy it right now for $65.
So we'll see.
They're trying to get you suckers on an impulse buy.
That's what it is.
I don't know.
All right.
Let's move on.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
Well, in the realm of PlayStation, they were sending out a survey seeing if people would be interested in having a digital comic service on the PS3 and not just on the PSP.
and um so I'm not sure if they're actually going to do that now but I mean it would be kind of neat being able to read my comics on the TV although honestly I can just look at my digital comics on my computer and we have a computer hooked up to our TV in the front room so big diff um I think nothing's really going to replace you know actually having paper in your hand and reading the comic and going ooh pretty you know
But for those that want it, it's available.
Well, good for them.
If Sony wants to do it, good for them.
Maybe they'll get something out of it.
I don't know that it's going to be worth the expenditure.
I'll read comics on my iPhone.
Having it handheld, that's one thing.
Yeah, those are a little more portable.
You don't have to take a book that you'd worry about ruining.
Oh, I'm at work right now and I want to read a comic.
I mean, I'm not at work and want to read a comic.
I'm on my lunch.
Yeah, I'm on my lunch break and want to read a comic.
I have my break sign up all day.
I'm surprised you haven't brought this up in your comic podcast yet.
You taped a comic podcast this morning, right?
Yeah, but we focus more on the comics themselves.
I see.
And where can they download that?
I'll let you work in a cheap plug for your new old spinoff show.
InfamousGamers.net is the site.
It's no I, there's just an N. Infamous.
The letter N. Nice.
Oh, it's actually just Infamous.net, yeah.
It used to be InfamousGamers.com.
But in the meantime, though, you also can find easier links right now on our various Twitters and whatnot.
Very cool.
All right.
Good luck with that, by the way.
And you're totally a sucker for having done that already this morning.
So you've already been broadcasting for an hour or two, right?
We were Skype-casting.
Skype-casting?
That works.
That's how we do it, is Skype.
Skype.
And when do your new episodes come out?
And every so often we get Dalek voice.
You tape today, but it'll come out what, tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Okay, very cool.
So I've got, after we're done here, I've got editing to do.
Fun!
Good luck with that.
All right.
All right, moving on to more stories, Loki.
So, it's kind of funny.
Medal of Honor, a big game that's going to be coming out from EA this October, is actually banned from military bases.
At least GameStop's located in military bases.
Apparently, this is a decision, I guess, by GameStop and also with, I believe...
They said the PX Commanding General of the Army and Air Forces Exchange Services.
I guess I made the decision about that.
So it says GameStop has agreed out of respect for our past and present men and women in uniform.
We will not carry Medal of Honor in any of our...
A.A.F.E.S.
based stores at this time does not include our four stores on marine installations GameStop fully supports the A.A.F.E.S.
in this endeavor and it is sensitive to the fact in multiplayer mode one side will assume the role of Taliban fighters
As such, GameStop has agreed to have all marketing materials pulled by noon today and stop taking reservations.
Customers who entered our AAFES stores and wish to reserve metal can and should be directed to the nearest GameStop location off base.
Again, we appreciate the sensitivity and know our AAFES based stores will continue to honor the great customer base in which they serve.
And of course that is because the Taliban are in multiplayer.
Oh yes, because our soldiers can go and fight in Iraq and stuff like that.
But oh my god, the Taliban's in a video game and then we're going to flip out because they can't handle that.
It's dumb.
That's just like saying we should remove all the Germans out of Call of Duty because, you know...
I don't know.
I would find it a little weird in the first place.
I mean, not weird, but I would...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Don't you want to play Mario Kart or something?
Oil.
Well, yeah, I understand it's oil as well, but, I mean, there's still the fighting for freedom kind of crap because, you know, you're trying to save everybody from the terrorists.
So, I just, I don't understand what the big deal is.
What's also interesting is that they're really not the first, you know, country, U.S., to take issue with this because I think we had a story on the show last week, right, about the British had a problem with this game too.
And we're talking about banning it, I think, in Britain completely.
Yeah.
GameStop GameStop GameStop
Redertainment in our chatroom kind of reiterates a point here.
We also support the ability of people in the military to go off base and buy the game.
Again, go off base and buy the game.
So, you know, it's not like the game is banned altogether.
I mean, that would kind of be against the Constitution, but, you know, they don't have to support it, I suppose.
So...
It's just something that they did because they think it's, you know, out of respect to those who serve, we will not be stocking this game.
And they apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.
But at the same time, they're like, well, just go off base and buy it.
I don't understand what the big deal is then.
If you were saying, oh, well, we don't want it on the base because that sets the wrong precedent.
But you can buy it off base and bring it back in.
That's fine.
Yeah.
Alright, let's talk about something a little less serious than these types of games and talk about something a little more casual, shall we?
This is also news that's coming out of Penny Arcade Expo.
It's a brand new crossover game from Telltale Games.
You might remember there was a teaser that I believe we brought up on the show last week.
So let's see, if you could imagine, what would Homestar Runner, the guys from Penny Arcade, Sam and Max, and now Team Fortress 2 characters, what are they all going to do in a new game together?
Blow shit up?
They are apparently showing off the game right now at PAX.
They've got posters and all that good stuff.
Dan Connors, the CEO of Telltale,
So it sounds like this game is going to have a lot of smack talking in it, which might be kind of cool, because Homestar Runner talking shit will actually be really funny, I think.
I think you're a stupid poopy head.
We'll see.
What I think is another thing to kind of draw out of that quote, we pitched the idea to friends in the industry.
So they got...
Team Fortress 2
Seaman Seaman Seaman
Maybe the chick from Mirror's Edge.
I could see EA and Steam have a close relationship.
And one of the unicorns from that stupid game on Steam.
The Pink Honest game?
Yeah.
Or if you're talking PC, how about an orc and a night elf?
Lady Gaga Lady Gaga
Some people have too much time on their hands.
It was actually kind of good.
I put it up there and you didn't even look.
I'm sorry.
When did you put it up?
Yesterday.
Well, I've been busy the past couple days.
I was busy sleeping yesterday, I'll have you know.
You how?
Two naps.
What's this, Alan?
Rob took two naps yesterday.
Two two-hour naps.
An old man.
He's very cute.
Shut up, don't judge me.
Oh, Jay Dizzle, perfect answer.
Duke Nukem should be in the game.
Hello?
Because, you know, it's going to be a big release coming up.
I like that answer.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about more gaming news.
Release date's coming up in just a moment, but first, DarkSakura has something for us.
Mine's not really so much of a story, so much as an impression.
The new screen caps for the Mortal Kombat game that's coming out are up.
And it looks really fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, that's what the word is.
I'm looking really at what I'm telling just from the images and it seems to me like there's this one scene in here with Katana, let me find her, where she's just covered in blood and it's fantastic.
And Melina has her horrible, ugly eat your face face and everything just looks like what Mortal Kombat used to be except for being 3D instead of
being, you know, the motion cap.
To be fair, I didn't play the DC Universe game, but I played pretty much all the others.
I really enjoyed the first couple, what was it, Deception, and there was another one in there too.
Not the last one they did with all the kids.
Thank you, Deadly Alliance.
That was actually a decent game.
Deadly Alliance is awesome.
I love the little RPG thing in there.
Yeah, you know, even those mini modes, some of them were kind of stupid, like in Deception they had the kart racing and stuff, which was definitely an afterthought, but I ate that shit up.
I thought it was awesome.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Awesome.
And that would be fantastic.
I want there to be special stage fatalities for every stage.
I hope so.
Because I want more blood.
It sounds like these new IP owners, Warner Brothers is taking care of this now after Midway, although a lot of the people that used to be involved are involved now.
It really sounds like they're just like, okay, after that DC... They interviewed Ed Boon about it a few months ago.
Yeah.
After that DC Universe game, let's just give the fans what they want.
Let's just go balls to the wall.
We want a Street Fighter 4-esque type of upgrade.
Because Street Fighter 4 was a fucking awesome upgrade from old school Street Fighter.
So I think that's what they're going to give us with this new Mortal Kombat game.
I'm looking at this red guy here and he's throwing the scorpion little chain thing.
Is that Ermac?
Or is that the ninja from Deadly Alliance?
Whatever his name was.
I can't remember his name.
I don't know.
But there's another thing that I wouldn't mind seeing.
I think he's Ermac.
You remember Soul Calibur's create a fighter thing?
And you can create certain ones that have actually a story to it?
I think that would be...
Reptile, Spitting, Splashy, Acid Vomit
They do a pretty good job on the Soul Calibur games, though.
I will give you that.
Probably my second favorite series of fighting games behind Mortal Kombat, and yes, even above Street Fighter, is Soul Calibur.
Those games are really badass, and I'm really waiting for news on Soul Calibur V. I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, it's about time to hear about Soul Calibur V, because the Yoda and Darth Vader days have long passed, so I'd like to know what's up with that.
There's, like, the robot dudes.
Cyrax.
I like that they've pulled a lot of the stuff that people liked from the other series.
I've actually got high hopes for this.
Yeah.
For any of our friends, though, that are at PAX, I want to hear what you think about it.
I'm liking that it looks like a lot of the roster for Mortal Kombat 3, except they kind of, at least so far, looks like they've said Sia to a lot of the characters that just really weren't notable out of those games, like Striker.
Like, you know, who... I liked him.
Who played Striker?
Oh, come on.
I did play him, actually.
Oh, come on.
He sucks.
Because...
If you knew how to use him right, he was really, really awesome.
And he had this one-punch combo that was super sweet.
I will say I loved Cabal.
I played Cabal.
He was awesome, and I don't think he's really coming back because he wasn't really notable in the mythology.
He had the run thing.
Yeah, that was cheap, and I loved Sindel.
I loved Sindel.
Sindel was badass, but again, what was she really there to do?
She was there to be the one dude's wife, and then she kind of disappears.
She didn't really... Or no, she's Katana's mom, though, isn't she?
I think so, and the other one was the Goro chick.
Yeah, I didn't care for her.
What?
Shiva.
Shiva, that was it.
I didn't care for her.
Like, oh, what a derivative name that is.
But I really like Sindel and her scream thing.
And really, like I said, it's not exactly a story.
And if anyone wants to see the images, just go to Eurogamer.net.
But they're really... I'm actually excited about a Mortal Kombat game.
VidPower in our chatroom says, Striker is the Dan of the Mortal Kombat universe.
Hey, if you can win a game with Dan, you're pretty awesome, right?
Nice, I like that Derek H in our chatroom By the way, I neglected to say this last week on the show And I really need to give a big holler and thank you to Derek H for the big battle Which wrapped up last week Even though we got our butts kicked by the host country, Dead Picks Alive You know how that usually happens in the Olympics?
The host country usually wins And Dead Picks Alive won We made a really good job second place So thank you to all the listeners who helped out in the big battle there And I just want to give kudos to Derek for putting that all together
I do the same thing with Cammy Cammy's actually a good character too
Oh, Alan, just like his eyes got really big and he's looking like, I'm gonna cut this bitch.
Dan hates Cammy.
Dan hates Cammy.
Dan's yelling from the other room.
Okay, so you like Cammy, right?
Yes, yes, she's amazing.
And my favorite thing that she does is the little mid-air combos where she spins and then goes into a different kick or a punch or something.
What are they called?
The hooligan combos, I think?
Here's my thing with Cammy.
I like her as a character.
And you know Kylie Minogue playing her in the movie was the best thing ever.
That was the only good thing about the movie.
I like her as a character, but as a street fighter, God, I hate her.
She's so useless.
Actually, no, I take that back.
T-Hawk is probably the most useless street fighter.
She just has a nice ass.
That's about it.
They drew her with a nice ass.
That's really the only good thing.
This is my thing.
It doesn't matter how much someone says a character sucks.
If you enjoy playing them and you're good at them...
Everybody else better watch out.
That's the trash-talking roots of the gaming universe.
What you believe to be true is law, and everybody else is stupid.
Everybody can agree that you'd probably look better naked than T-Hawk anyway.
T-Hawk would be disproportionate if he actually didn't have clothes on.
Anyway.
No penis.
Wow.
Anyway, the whole point is, it's just like with video games.
Games are only as good as the system they're on.
Not the system they're on.
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
Well, then a character is only as good as the player playing.
Take my Kami bashing with a grain of salt because I love Fei Long.
He's my favorite character in Street Fighter.
I think he's badass.
I enjoy playing Sakura, but that's just because she's fun because she does her little hop thing.
You?
Playing Sakura?
Karin was really good.
Gambit and Cammy
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.
It's starting to ramp up a little bit because we're getting into the long fourth quarter.
So starting things off, Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii and DS this week.
Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii version comes out later, if that's right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
NHL 11 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Midnight Mysteries, The Edgar Allan Poe Conspiracy on Nintendo DS Kingdom Hearts I will be buying that game Quoth the Raven, never more
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep coming out on the PSP.
No PSP Go though.
NHL Slapshot.
That's the crappy Wii game with the hockey stick controller.
Yeah, you're not going to break a TV with that.
Sports Champions!
That's the fun part!
When you're at your friend's house and he beats you in NHL, whatever, whatever, and he's like, yeah, ha, I beat you, you suck, ha ha, you can just start bashing the TV in with your controller saying, ha, well, I fucked up your TV, later, bitch.
Sports Champions, the Wii Sports type game for the PlayStation Move.
Once again, this will make a nice coaster for the next two weeks.
Saints Row Double Pack, it's a re-release of the two Saints Row games on Xbox 360 for only $29.99.
There's also a...
Let's see here.
Brunswick Cosmic Bowling Game, which I'm sure is not terrible at all on the Wii.
Uh, Ruse.
It's the real-time strategy game that you can bluff in on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
Uh, Aeon Assault on, uh, Valeria.
Looks like that's how you pronounce that.
Probably fucked that up.
Uh, that's on PC.
Uh, Start the Party.
It's gonna be a real party in your house when you're staring at this, uh,
in this Blu-ray case, and that's on the PS3.
What is it?
How do you start the party?
Start the party by buying the party supplies in preparation for two weeks.
What is this fucking game, Loki?
What are you doing?
You know, iToyPlay?
Think of that, but now with the PlayStation Move controller.
Kung Fu Rider, a game so terrible it's actually probably more fun to stare at the case than actually play it.
That'll be coming out as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.
Photo World, it's a game where you take photos with a DSi camera.
And yes, it's a DSi only game.
That's awesome.
I can do stuff that I don't know, I can do without the game.
With the game.
That sounds more useful than Ping Pals.
on the DS.
Yeah, almost.
The Sims 3 Fastlane stuff.
I got to read this in our chat room.
First off, I got to catch up on some chat comments because the chat's starting to fill up here.
Thanks to you guys for tuning in early.
We really appreciate it.
There's quite a few of you here tonight, so thank you guys.
Chat.orangehamsradio.com.
Let's see.
Where was that?
Oh, yeah.
I wanted to say this about Rose.
Derek H., who brought up Cammy in the first place, actually says, I destroy people with Rose.
Destroy.
So there you go.
Illusion Spark, bitches.
So it looks like you and Derek have a lot in common because you're both Cammy and Rose players.
Let's see.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
Start the party.
Red Entertainment says start the party.
Gin, vodka, and hot women not included.
Or fun.
I do have vodka and tequila.
Do you?
Yes.
Do you want some?
Yeah.
We're going to start the party right now.
Seriously, I need everyone to drink up my booze.
I'll have a little bit, but keep in mind, I gotta drive home when this is all over, so I'll get... You've got hours to get sober.
I'll have a drink or two.
Well, I could also run out and get dinner at some point, so I'll have, like, a beer.
Do you have a Guinness?
I want a Guinness.
No, I don't have a Guinness.
I have two Newcastles left.
Oh, Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle.
A few more games this week.
You can have Newcastle.
Oh, sorry.
UFC Undisputed 2010 on PSP.
Prison Tycoon Alcatraz, once again delayed.
Thank you, Value Soft, for not being able to hit your damn street dates.
Dawn of Heroes on DS, speaking of delayed games.
That'll be coming out this week, maybe.
King's Bounty Armored Princess.
Not sure what that is, but...
Yeah, it's on PC.
And finally, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future on Nintendo DS.
That comes out one week from today.
That is it.
All right.
Let's move on and talk about Japanese release dates, looking at what's coming out in Japan.
Starting off with the Xbox 360 on September 9th.
UFC Undisputed 2010 is coming out on the Xbox 360 for those that are into that.
Excuse me.
Moving on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming out over there.
If I can find it.
There we go.
Split Second gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 3.
Also, UFC Undisputed 2010 gets a release there, too.
By the way, next week, Front Mission Evolved.
Just so you know, that's on the 16th.
Wanted to get that out there because I know there's a lot of Front Mission fans.
It's kind of a cultish type of game.
Looking at the Wii and what's coming out on the Wii...
We have Okami getting a price cut this week on the Wii.
Biohazard 4 is also getting a price cut and the Biohazard Chronicles.
That of course is Resident Evil, what they call that series over there is Biohazard.
Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, One Piece Gigant Battle from Bandai Namco is coming out on the DS this week.
I have no idea what that game is all about, but I'm assuming it's going to be a giant battle.
That's what it's called.
DarkSakura, what's coming out in Europe?
On the 6th we have Chime for PC and then the 7th is Dragon Age Origins Witch Hunt and Mass Effect 2 Lair of the Shadow Broker and on the 8th we have Amnesia The Dark Descent and Plants vs. Zombies which is crack.
and then on the 10th we have Ace Combat Joint Assault, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 which I don't know I'm still kind of giddy about Birth by Sleep but this amnesia thing sounds kind of interesting I was looking up a little bit about it too that I think it would be interesting to to see that one but
Is that coming out in the US?
Amnesia?
The Dark Descent.
It's from Frictional Games.
Nope.
If it does, it'll be ported over by Zoo Games because they love taking European releases and bringing them out over here.
Eventually.
Eventually.
After they delayed them for months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months.
But Plants vs. Zombies, that game is kind of crack.
I mean... I'm actually looking... See, I'm looking forward to downloading that on the iPod when it comes in.
Supposed to get it next week because they're not yet released.
It's supposed to be out on DS in January.
Yes.
Yes.
But, you know, me being kind of a noob to the whole app store and stuff, I'm very pleased that they're not that expensive.
Except, I was actually shopping for something to use as like a Garmin or, you know, some sort of GPS thing.
To add GPS to the iPod Touch is ridiculously expensive.
I believe it's a TomTom adapter.
It's $79.99 just for the GPS adapter.
Then they want you to pay another $40 for the fucking app.
To which I gave them the big middle finger and said, fuck you, I will just look up directions on Google Maps and I'm smart enough as a human being to figure out how to get there.
I do not need you to tell me how to get there for almost $120.
Yeah.
I better be getting free blowjobs for $120 from that thing, you know.
It's just, it's not worth it.
Well, and honestly, I mean, if you've got, you may as well just use Google Maps, because seriously, it's kind of like irritating, I think, when you have the speaking GPS.
Yeah, I am going to get, though, I want to get one of these Virgin Mobile MiFis 2200s.
Now, I know that the MiFi 2200 is actually available through a bunch of different, like Verizon and Sprint and stuff like that.
But they're way more expensive and you have to have a contract.
So I'm cheap.
And sometimes I don't want to pay my bills.
So this is perfect.
Oh, I heard about those devices.
I kind of want to get one.
I'm serious.
I'm getting one for, we could do it for podcasting.
You can connect with the five devices.
We can do like podcasting anywhere.
Plus, I'm just going to shove it in my pocket and I can use my iPod Touch like, you know,
Like a phone, basically.
I would worry about podcasting over 3G, though.
Because we skip enough on this stream as it is.
Yeah, 3G's not... It's like an average DSL connection.
I mean, it's not horrible as long as you're in a decent area.
But, I mean, I don't know.
I wouldn't exactly use it for podcasting all the time.
Maybe just surfing the web while I'm...
Out there.
I like the iPhone as far as surfing the web and stuff, but I don't want to pay the fees each month for it.
Also, I don't really need the phone stuff too much.
I use maybe, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes a month.
All these cell phone plans are way too expensive for what they give me.
Although, I have been looking at... They've been advertising the new Virgin Mobile ones, too, for $25 a month for everything.
It's just I don't like the phones for that.
That's the only bad thing.
If it was like...
and iPhone for $25 a month then I'd be all over that shit.
Anyway, sorry.
I'm not trying to sound like a peddler for Virgin Mobile.
So let's talk about the PlayStation 3 and all sorts of weird stuff going on in the mod chip world there.
Um, you may remember the PlayStation Jailbreak was, um, announced last week, and of course, you know, for a very expensive hundred and, I don't remember how much it was, $70 or something like that for it.
Well, funny enough, um, you know, there was a temporary injunction placed on them last week where they were prevented from selling it until the 31st.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So everyone that bought one had their money returned, which is awesome because at the same time, the people that may have been buying them from Ozmodchips or even in the US, now Sony is going after the US manufacturers or I should say resellers.
Um, they're going at, uh, against, uh, against ZumbaLDC, whose, um, website shopsjailbreak.com has been, uh, selling a new PS3 jailbreak mod chips for the very expensive price of like a hundred and, you know, a hundred and some dollars.
PS Groove is an open source mod chip that runs off of a TNC++ USB development board or an 1890 USB key.
Both of those run under $30-some dollars.
It's $24 for the one and about $31 for the other, which is a lot cheaper than $100-some dollars.
And what's great about that is the part that kind of pissed off Sony with the whole backup manager, they actually have disabled the backup manager, but then of course people have released modified versions that have the backup manager in there again, but...
It is a solution that is now widely available.
So Sony, by snipping this other one in the butt, kind of made themselves a bigger problem.
And so now they're actually porting the PlayStation Groove to the PSP, which will run as an application on there, on a homebrew console.
So you'll actually be able to use your PSP for free to mod your PlayStation 3 if you have that.
Or if you can't wait for that to come out and you happen to have a Nokia N900, you can actually do that for free now.
And you can connect that to your PlayStation 3 using the special port of the PlayStation Groove to crack your system.
So...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The stealth version of it, which isn't entirely stealth yet because they haven't erased all the old ID code out of it, is making the game look like, or making it look like you're playing a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which a lot of people out there are, so it would be hard to track them down.
But it's only going to get worse for them now.
Because once you have this system out now to actually mod your system, people are going to find out ways to do custom firmwares and it only goes from there.
It's just going to snowball.
Is there anything Sony can do about all this?
I don't know if they can.
I mean, other than, you know, maybe they can fix the hack.
But apparently, from what I was reading, though, the way that they actually... This exploit is done is actually before the firmware.
So to patch it with the firmware might be impossible.
It's before the firmware actually kicks in.
So...
It's impossible maybe to do that, but they may be able to block the ID for the backup manager or something like that.
If it's that easy to change the game ID on the backup manager, that won't really be an issue because they can just keep changing it to keep dodging any blocks that they put in place.
So it'll be interesting.
Definitely they're going to be doing another update soon for either PlayStation Move stuff.
I know they already have that Move stuff available right now, the firmware for that.
But they're going to be doing the 3D Blu-ray stuff and who knows what other patches later on.
I mean, they're going to try to patch it, that's for sure.
But I have a feeling it's going to go back and forth just like the whole PSP stuff.
But you won't be able to play online with this, right?
They'll be able to get that, right?
As of right now, see, here's the thing with online.
See, that's the issue with playing with the backup manager because it shows that ID code and they can go, okay, this person's playing online with this ID code.
Okay, they're using the backup manager.
Ban.
We ban their console.
But they're changing it to mimic Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
It'll look like, oh, they're playing Modern Warfare 2.
and then they're not going to ban them.
So if they successfully mask the backup manager and make it look like Modern Warfare 2 then there really is nothing they can do as far as detecting which console is running this backup manager.
It's going to be tough.
Well, we'll see what develops.
I'm kind of curious to see how Sony's long-term strategy of this plays out.
It's kind of like, yeah, they can try and stop this with the court orders and everything, but once the technology is out there, it's out there.
It's going to be very hard to stop, especially when they're telling people how to make their own.
And they're already starting to dump games too.
So the whole scene now because the hard drives, you don't even really have to do too much.
You just can copy the file straight to your hard drive.
People are just doing Blu-ray dumps.
Would Spazinator be able to use this to get his videos to work when Sony keeps screwing them over with the whole new console and all that?
I don't know.
I mean...
I don't know.
Alright, let's see.
Breakman in our chat room says, so people hacked a Sony system?
Isn't that business as usual with Sony?
Not for the PS3.
Yeah, not for the PS3.
I mean, they really kind of rolled this out as unhackable and for a while it certainly seemed that way, although we all knew in the back of our heads somebody would hack it eventually.
So it's finally coming around.
But with the fact that Blu-ray hasn't really been easily adopted into burning and all that yet, it's still got a ways to go, I think, before you're going to see like, you know,
mass market piracy for this.
Yeah, I don't know.
But they keep claiming piracy killed the PSP, but I don't know.
I have mixed feelings on that.
I don't think it's totally right.
It's a good scapegoat because they don't really, it's hard to tell what the numbers are actually on that.
But, I mean, I'm sure it contributed to it, but then again, look at the Nintendo DS.
I mean, that system is doing really well, and I don't, I mean, I know piracy has affected that, but it's hard to say, and
I don't know.
It'll be interesting to see what happens.
But I don't know.
It'll just be fun to play around with, I think.
All right.
Well, let's move on to another story about the Xbox 360 this time and some price changes going on on the 360.
This was news that came out this week.
A one-month gold subscription to Xbox Live is going up.
Starting November 1st, $8 to $10.
Three months, going up from $20 to $25.
And a full year of Xbox Live, up $50 to $60.
Of course, that's really $49.99 to $59.
It's $50 to $60.
The price of Xbox Live has gone up, folks.
But what's interesting about this story, it's the first time we've ever had this story in the history of our show, which has been going about as long as Xbox Live has.
They haven't raised the price in the years that it's been active.
Is it justified that they raise the price now?
What do you guys think?
I kind of thought it was about time.
I mean, you gotta keep up with the market and if you're not making enough to match cost and still have the right profit margin they're expecting, then I don't see why not.
by the way if you're worried about this price increase there are some ways you can lock in the old price you can do a renewal of one year through xbox.com right now for 40 bucks or you can also buy some of those prepaid cards right now with the lower prices because you know you can still find those for the old prices and if you load up on a couple of those then you'll be locked in for however much time and dude it's seriously like 80 some cents more a month
I mean, that's what it is averaged out.
And honestly, $10 more?
Yeah, that is more money for you to pay.
But, I mean, look at what the hell download content in your Xbox Live Arcade games cost that much.
And I understand that everybody's cash strapped nowadays with the economy and everything.
But come on!
Take... Eat one less lunch out or something.
I mean, stop fucking bitching about $10.
It's not like the price is doubling.
And I understand that you may not use all the features.
Because honestly, I don't use most of the features on Xbox Live.
I don't use Twitter.
I don't use Facebook.
You know, none of the extra stuff.
You know, the ESPN streaming and stuff like that.
I could care less about it.
And the fact that it's going up $10, it doesn't really bother me because...
you know so what well speaking of ESPN in our chat room Blaze says given that this ESPN functionality is supposed to be absurdly amazing then it's not that big a deal Breakman says fuck you Microsoft everyone kept asking them when Xbox Live will go free so they said fuck you we'll raise the price I'm okay with this price hike because they haven't done one in so long and it does seem like you know the amount of content on Xbox Live there's a lot of it there I'm okay with it you know because we're talking on a yearly basis too
If this is where we're going instead of the online pass, I'm okay with it.
But unfortunately, I think we all know it's not.
That online pass still exists.
And to me, you can't do this and that.
This online pass is ridiculous in the first place, but it's even more so with this.
I don't blame Microsoft for the online pass stuff.
I blame the third-party publishers for that.
Microsoft could stop it.
It's their servers, their store.
They can stop.
It's their software, though.
If they want to prevent people from connecting online, they can do that.
It's their software.
I understand that they should step up and say, hey, you shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff on our service because they made everybody play nice with the guitar controllers and stuff like that.
They all had to work together.
That was kind of cool, but...
Thanks for watching!
like if Microsoft said oh by the way we're going to charge you $10 to play this game online or I'm sorry Microsoft said no we're going to charge you $10 extra to play this game online if you buy it used then there might be some issues but I don't think they're going to go that route because they're making enough money as it is on live and maybe they try supporting it with ad revenue and stuff like that and maybe it's just the cost to run this stuff keeps going up and up I mean they keep adding you know
Features and stuff to it.
Maybe it's just getting more expensive.
I don't know.
I really do feel the value of $50 for Xbox Live now is certainly better than it was 8 years ago.
Which is cool.
I don't think that they would just say, we want to make more money so we're going to raise the price.
I think that they would actually say, because they're going to try to keep it as low as possible to stay competitive with the PlayStation Network.
And
I don't see them raising prices just because, oh, we need to make more money.
I think it's just that the cost of doing things is going up.
Blaze said, remember that this online pass stuff applies to games that are multi-console, and Microsoft requires an online play go through their servers, but Sony makes third-party people run their own servers.
Well, okay, but still, then put the online pass on Sony, not Microsoft.
Seriously, though... Stop being lazy and just putting out the same code for both systems.
If people are that pissed off about a $10 price hike, then you need to spend the extra effort it's going to take to go and find those cards for cheaper.
And honestly, they're...
There are cards out there.
There's a lot of ways to get cards for like 40 bucks now.
I mean, go stock up on some of those.
If you're so concerned about spending the extra 83 cents a month, I mean, seriously, go for a walk around your local strip malls and stuff like that.
You could probably find 83 cents on the ground.
I mean, it's not that fucking expensive.
Seriously, go without a can of soda one week, you know?
I mean, 83 cents a month.
Let's break that down by week.
That's like 20 cents a week.
I mean, come on.
Find a dime.
I understand that it's not that much money, but here you go, you devil's advocate.
It's the principle.
They're raising the price, and what are they doing to justify the raising of the price?
Well, people aren't too worried about paying $60 for games.
That's a $10 price hike per game, so why aren't you just still playing your original PlayStation 2 and Xbox then?
Why aren't you boycotting all these different game systems since it's so expensive for you to spend the extra $10?
I think you're a fucking hypocrite is what I think you are.
Breakman in our chatroom says, I'll pay Microsoft an extra $10 a month to take Facebook off my 360.
Amen to that.
Facebook on 360 is ugly.
Like, it looks better on a cell phone, and that is saying a lot.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on and get into the classic video game of the week.
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane where DarkSakura will dig into the gamer vault and find a game that she thinks, hey...
You kids out there in internet land.
Get off my lawn and play this game.
Get off my lawn and go inside and play this game.
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
X-Men for the Sega Genesis.
Aw, not this little player arcade.
I have to save something for the future, Rob.
Anyway, um...
Probably, I think, one of the best games that came on the Genesis.
It was in 1993, and it was the whole 90s era of X-Men.
and the game basically starts off where you're in the danger room and there's a virus that goes into the danger room so you have to go through different areas within the danger room and then fight Magneto at the end.
So you play as Gambit or Nightcrawler, Wolverine or Cyclops and they have...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
So yeah, with Wolverine, he basically has his big bad claws and his healing factor.
Gambit has his charged cards for a special attack.
Cyclops has the optic blast.
And Nightcrawler has the ability to teleport, which is useful.
He was actually my favorite character to use in the game.
You also get Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel as sort of helpers.
You can call on them for help.
And you can also get Jean Grey to pop up if you happen to fall.
And you fight different X-Men villains, so it's pretty cool.
But one of the cool things about this game, and it had a... It broke the fourth wall, Bob.
You know?
It, um... When you defeat Mojo, you have to reset the computer in the Danger Room, but what it really means is reset your machine.
And the whole trick is that you just sort of have to pop the reset button, and then it'll black out and pop up these numbers like a computer rebooting, you know, in the 90s.
So what, somebody's 486, I guess?
Anyway.
Um... But, uh, we had a giggle from Loki about something...
Something with someone posing.
I'm curious now.
Can we wait until after the classic game?
One thing that I need to point out is that if you hit the button too hard, of course, it will reset the game and you're like SOL.
Or if you have a Nomad, the Nomad doesn't have a reset button, so you're SOL there unless you level skip.
Um, all of the music in the game was done by Fletcher Beasley, who used the Genesis emulation music software, and it would work with the Yamaha 2612 FM synthesizer chip on the Genesis, so you could play the sounds back through it and you'd know what it sounded like.
So it's actually got a really cool soundtrack.
I think that it sounds really good.
Um...
But he's quoted as saying that he was trying to use the sound of the distorted guitar in his tracks to make them sound edgier.
And I mean, it's got a great soundtrack.
Kudos to him.
But it was a really cool game.
It actually, there's one level in that game that pissed me off to no end and it was always the Mojo World level.
Hated it.
I'm done.
That's fighting mode.
Mojo Jojo.
Just kidding.
Alright, there you go, your classic game of the week is X-Men on the Genesis.
Good times.
Thank you very much, DarkSakura.
Good pick, even if I'm more of a fan of the arcade one, but that's okay.
Okay, Loki, why are you giggling?
Oh, nothing, there was someone who was pointing out, actually one of our listeners, they were pointing out that
Have you heard that... Have you seen the story about Earth Defense Force?
A new Earth Defense Force game coming out next year.
And I actually clicked on the link to check it out.
And then it links the Structoid article that links also a CheapAssGamer article where I'm the source of that news information.
Nice.
It's like...
Yeah, I heard about it.
Actually, I'm looking at this.
This was just, what's today, the 5th?
This was like four hours ago.
Yeah, the GameStop conference, I think they had an actual logo for it.
And if you go to edfia.com, you can check out, they have the placeholder logo for Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
Orange Launch Radio Podcast co-host Loki has recently uncovered a sequel to the B-movie quality Earth Defense Force 2017.
If this news is correct, then all is well with the world.
The game falls under the same category as Deadly Premonition for me.
According to his information, Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon for the Xbox 360 is being released sometime in February 2011 by D3 Publisher.
Loki, who works for a game distributor and has a strong track record on things such as unannounced games, tweeted the following.
Just saw this on my release list from D3 Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon coming February on Xbox 360.
Dude, wasn't that like a month ago?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oops!
I don't want D3 being pissed off at me because then that comes back to me and then I lose my job.
That's why you gotta stop putting on Twitter.
You have to do it here on the show in Secret Club where these people don't listen.
I'm a crazy person that says these things, okay?
It's just meant for sharing with the listeners, not to be as posted as a story.
It's so when Joystick picks this article up, say four months from now, and they're like, hey, we just discovered that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then it'd be like, hey, I knew about that months ago.
Good job.
It's just so you can realize that we knew it first.
They better not be mad at you because you know what?
You've been supporting this game from the beginning.
It is so awesome.
I am so excited.
You probably helped this sequel happen, honestly.
I don't know anyone who talks about this with you.
It is so awesome.
I own four copies of this game, okay?
And you know why I did that?
Just in case ever one of my discs breaks.
Which one of them has?
Because I played it so much.
So I had three backup copies I bought.
We were clearing them out of our warehouse for five bucks each.
I'm like, I'm taking all of those.
So, yeah, I love this game.
And I fully support the sequel.
And I hope to God it has four-player co-op.
Can I borrow one?
I actually looked for the game.
I wasn't able to find it.
Yeah, sure.
All right.
But, yeah, lesson learned here.
Stop.
Posting Loki's stuff.
No, I don't care.
It doesn't.
I don't.
I mean, they would have said something by now.
Yeah, it's true.
It was out there a month ago.
And honestly, I mean, it's... The official logo showed up now.
They have the official websites up and the GameStop conference.
Someone took a picture.
It says, Earth Defense Force returns 2011.
So there you go.
They have a banner for it.
It's happening.
Okay, so the story that went up four hours ago then is like behind because this has already been confirmed.
It's no longer a rumor.
Yeah, well, Destructoid, they ran their story 16 hours ago, apparently.
And they just picked up on... Neo games are fun, I guess.
They ran... This was posted yesterday.
So... I don't know.
People are just figuring it out now.
See, that's why you gotta read my stuff closely.
Because...
Well, Destructoid called D3 to get confirmation, so maybe you'll be in the office on Tuesday.
Who told you that?
Well, they referenced CheapAssGamer.
But they also have NeoGAF, though, right above that link, if you noticed.
Wait, you know what?
That's kind of fucked up, though, because it really wasn't CheapAssGamer.
It's somebody on a blog on CheapAssGamer who starts off by referencing you.
That really was not CheapAssGamer doing that at all.
It had nothing to do with that.
It was that user.
So either that user or you should have been credited.
I'm just saying.
A little bit.
I don't really care that I'm not credited.
I guess that's true.
It's Blueswim, which I believe is one of our listeners.
Yeah, I've heard that name before.
It's one of our listeners.
I get it.
That website does little personal blog things and he's excited about this game like you are.
As he should.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know.
It's stupid.
Alright.
We're over it.
Let's get past this.
I'm over it.
Yeah, let's get past this.
It's just kind of funny.
I am going to beg them, though, for a copy of that game.
You need to send that to me now!
Alright, we're going to take a break.
We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
Tonight's the marathon, folks.
We're about...
Almost two hours in already.
And we've got plenty more show to come.
We still have the main show.
We are going to do Twitter topics, rapid fire stories, some news about the iPod Touch we're going to get into, some iPod related news, Xbox Live Arcade, price drop for the DSi, the mailbags, the FUs, all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are going to be taking a music break here.
I'm going to be editing the podcast a little differently.
It's just going to kind of jump skip into the next segment.
So I apologize for the sloppy editing, but we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast.
We are going to take a quick break though here in studio.
We'll do some music.
By the way, today's break music is like all music that we used to play on OLR when we were an actual station back in what, like 2002, 2003?
Yeah.
because we're awesome that way yes so we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio don't go anywhere about five minutes marathon continues
Orange Lounge Radio
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So Twitter topics, if you're hearing my voice and you want to get some Twitter topics in, send those in.
Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?
Oh, hey, on Twitter topics, guys, try to refrain from just linking us to news stories because we have a lot coming up later in the marathon, too.
Not that we don't appreciate that, but we probably are covering it at some point.
But if you have good questions or feedback on an earlier story or something, that's definitely what we're looking for tonight.
Alright, so let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.
There was an Easter egg discovered from Wave Race Blue Storm.
Yes, that old game.
They actually just found a... What was it?
It's an Easter egg that kind of changes some of the announcer audio in the game.
He starts berating you, and then also, for some reason, when you do your boost, it goes, which is...
I'm sure Irene would get a kick out of that.
But yeah, it's interesting though.
Apparently it's just a key press that you do on one of the options screens.
It's funny that games, even though they're out that long, that some Easter eggs haven't been discovered yet.
I remember there was one a couple weeks ago about a Splinter Cell game.
They actually had it where there was a secret mission where you had to recover or had to find all these space seals that were hidden in the game.
It was a special save the seals mission, which is kind of weird.
There is a game from Activision called Blood Drive.
I guess the information has been leaked out from the BBFC.
I also saw it on their list.
And it is going to be a combat racing game.
I guess the marketing shill, as they put it, is Shaun of the Dead meets Mad Max in Death Race.
So basically a game that's cheesy and very gory.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it sounds awesome.
And it is somewhat budget priced.
It's $50 retail.
And it'll be coming out in November.
So that would be cool.
I'm down for combat racing games.
And cheesy is good, as long as it's a good game.
Not necessarily a terrible driving game.
Thanks for watching!
But anyways, in case you're still curious about it, it is a port of a German Wii game developed by Sproing.
And I guess you'll practice 20 unique choreographies and dance your way from the street stage all the way to the TV studio.
Under the watchful eye of Detlef D. Soest.
Some douche.
Who is basically some German dancer, choreographer.
Like I said.
Honestly, like I said before, it's a terrible game.
It's just, it doesn't play very well.
And if you look at the screenshots that they have of it, it's got this really weird...
Not like a note highway or something, but it's sort of like DDR where they've got arrows coming down the screen, but it's two different rows of arrows, as you can see right here.
And you have to kind of move your controllers in different directions to match the different analog sticks.
And while that might be cool and stuff to do on, like, say...
You know, a dance pad or something.
It's really awkward on the controller, especially since one side doesn't correspond to certain directions.
It's just mixed all over the place.
And, uh... The music's terrible, so...
Don't buy it.
Instead, you need to buy some other games.
I think Plants vs. Zombies might be this week.
Check that out.
Then, of course, the new iPod Touch with iOS 4, the Retina display, and Game Center has been revealed at the new Apple event that was this week.
is available in an 8GB model for $229, 32GB for $299, and a 64GB model for $399.
It is coming out next week, and it basically has all the wonderful features of the new iPhone 4, except, of course, no GPS, no phone, and much cheaper, I think.
But, yeah, I will be picking one of those up myself.
Also, some of the other stuff that they announced at the event, of course, the new Apple TV for $99, which is kind of cool, I guess, if you're into that.
And then something else that was kind of cool, one of the things that they're really kind of pushing that the iPhone and iPod is like a gaming platform.
Project Sword, which is a game that's running on the Unreal 3 engine and is coming out from Epic.
And it actually looks pretty good.
So it is a sword fighting game that is focused on one-on-one battles.
So kind of like... Oh, there's some Wii game that came out that's kind of similar to that.
Hopefully not like the Castlevania fighting game.
But...
Looks pretty good, and it's kind of amazing to see that they have ported the Unreal 3 engine to iOS.
Neat.
Neat.
All right.
Now, Alan, you were telling me about something earlier that you'd seen about this whole mess, right?
I've been reading on Joystick and Kotaku about a free tech demo that Epic released this week called Epic Citadel for the iPhone 4 and also for the new iPod Touches that are coming out.
It's basically the engine that this sword game is going to be running on.
It's pretty much just you and the touch interface in a town.
and all you can do is really just walk around and look at stuff.
But the graphics, I guess, the way they ported the Unreal Engine into the phone is so good that you just can't believe that you're getting this on an iPhone.
And the videos for it, for those that want to look it up on Google, it's called Epic Citadel.
It's free on the App Store.
So whoever has a new iPhone can download it and check it out.
It's supposed to be amazing.
I'm downloading it right now.
You know what's really sad is all they would really have to do now with the iPhone to really kind of compete in the market.
Well, I mean, they already are competing in the market with like the Nintendo DS and the PSP, but they're really kind of...
Well, they came out at the conference.
They took a shot at Nintendo and Sony and said that they've sold more than those two combined, although it's fuzzy math.
Yeah, I understand.
All right, I'm downloading it.
But to basically kind of deliver that finishing blow, if you would put it, if they added some sort of actual buttons, some sort of controller interface to that, it would be – I mean, how are you going to compete with that?
I mean, now you've got a platform that's very popular.
The apps are really cheap.
and the games are actually getting to be on par if not better than some of the stuff that's on the PSP and on the DS yeah it really is the one thing the iPhone, iTouch, whatever is missing is a tangible controller I mean if they could have that it would be amazing when you were playing Sonic 2 on the iPhone 4 at the Apple store they had to bring the screen in a little bit to like a little thumbnail so that it could put a little digital D-pad and buttons on there and it really affected the gameplay
Yeah, I sure did.
We'll see.
An AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom at chat.orangeandre.com agrees, seriously, Apple just needs to make a controller shell for it.
K.O.
Ray in our chatroom says, yes, Epic Citadel is all eye candy and it looks sweet.
Here's something.
I mean, we've kind of thrown this idea out for a while now.
You know, what if Apple made a gaming console?
Well, what if they did?
I mean, the Apple TV's down to $99.
Who's to say they can't come up with some sort of wireless Bluetooth controller or something that
All they have to do is put iOS on that box.
Yeah, iOS on the box to make it a wireless controller.
Maybe a little bit more powerful, kind of like an iPhone or something like that.
Then now your games are really cheap.
It's all digital, but make a portable system.
They're going to...
Sony better step up, because seriously, right now they're really slacking as far as their system goes, and they're going to lose it really quick.
We'll see.
Alright, well speaking of the iPhone, Mirror's Edge and Puzzle Agent also came out on the iPhone.
Those were releases earlier this week.
Mirror's Edge was already out on the iPad, but now it's on the iPhone.
On the iPad it was $10, and now it's only going to be $5 on the iPhone.
Telltale is trying out a game release on iPhone.
It's Puzzle Agent.
You might remember this came out on PCs a little bit ago.
That is where Telltale games are about approximately on the other iDevices.
So yeah, they're on the App Store and check those out if you are interested in either of those series.
Otherwise, going back to the more traditional consoles, on the Xbox Live Arcade, King of Fighters Sky Stage is supposed to be hitting the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade on September 15th.
It's going to be costing $10, 800 Microsoft points or whatever that converts to in yen.
And that is the one, by the way, where Terry Bogard and Mai are like shooters.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's kind of interesting that Disney's doing this twice Because Epic Mickey has a collector's edition too But with Tron Evolution For PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 There will be the collector's edition It comes with a toy model light cycle From Sideshow Collectibles A display case for it With a drawer to keep the game in It's $130 So you're paying an extra $70 for this figurine But I gotta say
That's a sweet looking figurine.
It's like a little light bike from the new movie.
If it actually lit up, I might have to do it.
No word on that yet.
I would just wait and see because they're going to have collectible toys and stuff I'm sure when the Tron stuff comes out.
You could probably buy one standalone that would be a lot cooler than that.
Those collector's editions, man.
Sometimes it's a real waste of money.
However, you know the Black Ops one that they have coming out now with that little car that has a camera on it and stuff?
Those things are actually out now as some other device.
But they're really popular in the hacking community because they're so easy to modify to do a bunch of different things like installing Linux and crap on it and stuff.
So it might be a good buy to actually get that.
or if you're smart, you'll just go buy the actual toy that's out now instead of spending the extra money.
Tron is awesome, but any game that's a movie tie-in, eh, not sure if wants.
I don't know, this game looks pretty awesome.
I gotta say, I played it at E3 and it was kinda cool because it was like Prince of Persia, but with Tron graphics.
And like, apparently it's heavily influenced with Capoeira, like all the fighting is based on Capoeira.
I gotta say, it was kinda rad.
But Shane was watching me play it, and you know, Shane didn't really see Tron as a kid because I think he was like born the year it came out or something.
So, like, I know, right?
So, I think like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But, uh, they have it where, um, you know, the main guy, cause it kinda reminds me a lot of, like, The Force Unleashed, almost.
Um, you know, he's chasing after these guys on light cycles and stuff, and, um, one of the, uh, recognizers, and, you know, he's chasing after them, and all of a sudden, you know, he kills one of them with the disc on the actual light cycle, and then, uh, they start shooting at him, he jumps up, uh, like, runs along the wall, and then transforms back into the light cycle again.
It's just fuckin' sweet.
I gotta admit, I've been to the movies a couple times lately, and that trailer usually plays, and every time they show the trailer for the new Tron movie, I get a little stiffy.
It looks awesome.
We need to see that in 3D, IMAX, and with those D-Box motion seats.
Just do the full shebang.
As soon as those tickets go on sale, I'm almost wanting to go to LA just to see it at the official Disney theater, because I'm that crazy excited.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's a Tron world after all
and, uh, yeah, it's gonna be this huge event that starts October 8th.
It better have all the games in there.
And this is what pisses me off.
That's a week after I'm gonna be there anyway for Gay Days.
So mad.
Bitches.
But, that means I have to go back.
Let's go.
So it's October 8th until, I think, we need to go.
Like, are we that crazy?
Yes.
Yes.
We're going.
So there'll be no show the week the Tron movie comes out because DarkSakura and I are gonna go see it at the official 3D Disney theater in Anaheim.
Yes, yes we are.
Wow, we're going to travel across country to see a movie in a theater.
Yes, we're worse than the Twilight fans in some regards.
If only we could do that here and see a movie in a theater.
But you don't understand because then when it's over, we can go to the electronica party and then we can ride Space Mountain a million times.
They should actually redo Space Mountain as Tron Mountain for the movie.
Well, there's a rumor that if the Tron thing is really successful and the movie does really well, that the Tomorrowland arcade is going to permanently be Flynn's arcade.
That will make me completely giddy.
I think that's the way it should be too.
I hope that the reproduction Flins that they do is going to have all the old games and everything too.
I don't care.
Apparently it's the same Flins Arcade that's been at Comic Con and some of that stuff.
It's been traveling around a little bit.
I don't care if this new Tron movie is terrible.
You all need to satisfy what I've built it up in my mind of seeing this as a child and you all need to go see this movie opening day so it does well.
and dude, it's Flynn's the bad guy.
At least I think he is.
Or is he?
It might be a clone.
It's Clue's the bad guy.
Anyway.
I'm so excited.
Takeo Reyes in our chatroom saying, oh, the marathon's affecting Sky already.
Stiffies, crazy trips to Disneyland.
It's over.
Chat.orangeonstrater.com Let's see.
Breakman.
Disney's gonna make a live nerd dance party?
Yes, they are.
Nerd dance party.
And you know if DarkSakura and I are gonna be there, it's an extra nerd dance party.
We need to figure out what day that is and announce our arrival well in advance.
We need sparkly silver clothes.
Because we need to get some of our LA peeps to gum.
We need Marissa to shake her boobies at this.
We need DJ Tyrant to show up and write a story for the website once every six months or so.
Disneyland friends, people who work there.
Yes.
We love you.
Yeah, we need our cast member friends that work there to show up.
I know we have other LA listeners, so we're going to figure out what day this is.
And the minute tickets go on sale, we've got to get them.
Okay, we're doing this.
Oh my god, I'm so excited.
Maybe Scott can come with you.
Scott's in LA?
Yeah.
There we go.
Of course, I'm making all these plans while Dan's in the other room probably going, the fuck she is.
Dan, we're going to go see Tron at Disneyland, okay?
He said we have it on air.
I'll take Dan.
I'll take it.
Put Dan in the car.
Dan's coming with us.
I don't care.
We ain't working.
All right.
Anyhow, Spazinator in chat says Sky will try to get Loki to build him a real light cycle.
I just might.
All right.
I don't know how to build motorcycles.
Well, you better learn real quick.
All right.
Let's move on with some other quick stories.
That was supposed to be a quick story.
It ended up taking like 15 minutes.
Dark Sakura.
Namco is remaking Arcade Classics.
Actually, coming out for Wii is going to be Namco Museum Megamix, which has different remixed games, like the Galaga Remix, the Pac-Man Rail Shooter thing.
There's also going to be, though, an old-school game called Grobda Remix, which is a shmup-y game, so yay.
Also, of course, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally-X, Galaga, blah, blah, blah.
and then for Sims 3 fans like myself, Barnacle Bay!
They're getting on the big pirate bandwagon.
And you know what my theory about this is?
They're putting out downloadable content so that you can have you know like it's a whole town of piratey goodness but I think they're really getting the inspiration from all these players that have made their own pirate stuff.
So they're just like, oh we'll do it too.
So anyway it's going to be coming out.
Can you make Johnny Depp walk the plank?
I wish.
And then for people who may be a little bit pissed off with Xbox in September, there's Halo freebies.
Yay.
So with the launch of Halo Reach, it's going to be the 14th through 20th will be Invasion Week.
And you get new gear, exciting content.
Help!
Microsoft's invading my wallet!
Spectacular prizes!
And a chance to play with creators of the game, and that was a quote.
Also, Xbox Live Gold features to Silver members on September 17th through 20th, and anyone who gets online can download the Invasion theme.
I just see Master Chiefs running around in party hats.
Also, as well, Resident Evil 5 Avatar outfits and game add-ons will be discounted.
September 13th, Puzzle Games will be getting the DOTW deal, Best to Move Live, Puzzle Chronicles, Tower Blocks, Deluxer, knocked down to 400 Microsoft points, $5, and Gyromancer is going from $1,200 to $800.
And then Rock Band 3 Avatar stuff, and...
Also on the Marketplace is Bully Scholarship Edition and Cabela's African Safari, which isn't Africa.
Speaking of all this, are we allowed to talk about what Dan's playing in the front room right now?
Or is that like a no-no topic?
No-no?
Okay, no-no.
Never mind.
This is completely unrelated to what we were just talking about, I promise.
We can talk about it, but I don't know where he got it.
Me neither.
Me neither.
Oh, sweet.
Oh, we're getting more people committing to coming to the electronic.
Oh, this is going to be awesome.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on.
Did you have a story you wanted to do, Loki?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, wait.
I got to do Twitter topics.
Oh, my gosh.
I don't want to forget the tweets.
Let's do Twitter topics.
Okay.
That'll give you a little more time to think about that story anyway.
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet.
We only have a few tonight probably because I said don't send us links.
Also, I don't think I don't think Tigerclaw's in chat tonight.
Like, is he okay?
He probably went on vacation for Labor Day like most people do.
Every night I expect to see links from Tigerclaw.
They're not there tonight.
Do we need to send a search party to his home?
Because this is not typical.
But I think he's probably on a trip.
Let loose the hounds.
All right.
Let's move on.
Our good buddy Jay Jugo on Twitter is saying, Breakdown for the win by OLR because they're playing the old school music tonight from our old rotation, which is all the old Bomani music and so forth.
Maren Marvel, speaking of people we may or may not see at the Tron thing, is OLR Marathon Night a horrible night to have a curse?
Yes, what curse, what would be a bad curse to have during the, what would be a bad curse to have during the OLR marathon?
Glittery vampires.
Probably diarrhea would be a bad curse to have actually during this marathon.
So we better not get pizza.
Alright.
Let's see, more tweets here.
Leo Shen sends us a tweet.
BlazeBlue, Continuum Shift 2 announced for arcades and three new characters are on the way.
He does link us to the official website, and I don't think this is a story that even comes up later.
Now, the official website's all in Japanese, so I can't say a whole lot else with this, but for those of you guys that are fans of this series, you played this game, right, Alan?
Yeah.
I think Loki, you might have a little bit too.
I have the arcade version on my cabinet.
Did you have this in Gamefly one week?
Yeah, it was the very first game I got with Gamefly and I brought it over to your house.
So I guess there's a new one coming out, so that's pretty cool.
TKL Ray sends us a tweet Would y'all be interested in doing the Extra Life Marathon this year?
Donations go to your local CMN hospital, which if I'm not mistaking is Children's Miracle Network, I think I do remember these tweets from last year God, has it been a year already?
I guess so October 16th It depends Didn't we try to do this last year and something happened?
I think we did.
Yeah, it just didn't work out.
Something happened.
It didn't work out.
If we can't participate directly, we'll definitely donate at least, but we'll see.
I don't want to commit just yet, especially after doing a marathon tonight.
I don't know if we could do a full, full, full marathon, especially after having just done one tonight.
We should have waited, huh?
But we'll see.
Spazinator PSN tweets For those that have a PS3 and care, there's an episode of Campus PD on the PSN store that's temporarily free.
It's under TV shows and free.
This is what I watch early in the morning.
Drunken sorority chicks?
It's basically just cops on... There was an episode of that I watched that they were busting some guys for having pot in a frat house or something like that because they saw it through a window.
And so they came in and it was just a bunch of...
Hippie college kids complaining that you don't have the right to enter my premises, blah, blah, blah, blah.
But it's in plain sight.
We can see it right here.
Therefore, it gives us probable cause to enter your residence.
So shut the fuck up, Mr. Law Major.
Pot in a frat house?
You don't say.
I know.
Get out.
Get right out of town.
It was... No.
Oh my gosh.
DarkSakura.com
If you've watched Cops in Mardi Gras or whatever, they have that episode or whatever.
Ho Ho Ho, their special episodes with all the prostitutes that they're picking up and stuff.
Put your top back on, ma'am.
Ma'am.
Put your shirt back on, ma'am.
Come with me, ma'am.
If we had anything to drink tonight, ma'am.
Yeah, I mean, it's... Yeah, wonderful programming.
This is what they put... Can you believe COPS is still on?
Like, COPS started, like, when FOX Network started in, like, 87, and it is still on.
Well, that America's Most Wanted, still going.
That's true.
Is John Walsh still hosting after all these years?
Probably.
Didn't they finally find who killed his son, like, just not that long ago, and it turns out the guy died?
Well, the guy that was already in prison, I think, kept confessing and then recanting it like four times so they couldn't.
But yeah, it's probably on his Wikipedia.
Oh, probably.
That was a horrible story, though, what happened.
Yeah.
Because he was, it actually involves video games.
He was playing like an Atari 2600 when he got kidnapped, right?
Or something like that, out of Sears or something?
I think so.
Or watching other kids play it, I think.
I don't know.
Anyway.
Sorry.
Don't mean to be a downer on the show.
Wah, wah.
Wah, wah.
Wah, wah.
That was it for the Twitter topics.
We'll be taking more tweets later on in the evening at twitter.com slash OLR.
I'll be tweeting random stuff and Klingon, by the way.
Thank you.
DarkTetsuya says that SalaciousPop does a great state trooper.
There you go.
Ma'am, please.
Ma'am, don't run out into the street, ma'am.
Put your shirt on.
Into the car, ma'am.
Breakman in the chat says, Ma'am, please put your shirt back on.
Oh, sorry, I meant sir.
PlayStation 3 and PSP
It is, I guess, powered by Curiosity, which is not a word, but according to Sony it is.
It is apparently going to be a music service that's cloud-based that'll, at least it'll be coming out in Europe, and subscribers will have access to millions of songs, and then, of course, it's going to be very similar to kind of the Zoom pass that's on, you know, Microsoft's service.
and it says in addition the service will be compatible with Bravia TVs, Blu-ray disc players, home theater systems, and VAIO computers with one single account without the need to manage digital files so you can listen to a bunch of stuff.
So am I correct in assuming this is just more that corporate synergy with Sony Music?
I think so, yeah.
And so probably a movie thing is... Well, I guess they already have movies on Sony Marketplace, so I guess never mind, but maybe more TV.
Just want a piece of the apple pie.
I'll come in together.
I mean, I guess if they've had movies and TV all this time, I mean, where the hell's the music been?
Once in a while, they'll have like a game soundtrack or something.
But, you know, they haven't done a major music store at all.
That's for sure.
They haven't done anything major on their services.
So, yeah, I don't know.
All right.
Well, let's move on and talk about going back to the iPhone stuff a little bit.
Actually, I used to play this game a lot.
It was Aurora Faint.
It was kind of a Bejeweled-y type game that they have on the iPhone.
Well, these guys are really taking these to the next level.
They've written their own
PlayTime is this new thing.
It's going to be a real-time multiplayer game
Playtime will allow real time voice chat during the gameplay across these platforms.
CEO Jason Citrone of Aurora Feint said, quote, Traditionally, multiplayer technology has been accessible only to top-tier developers.
It's just too complicated and time-consuming.
So we invented PlayTime, which literally takes one day to integrate into a casual game.
More information about this, VOIP, lobbies and matchmaking for casual games, expanding to incorporate team-based voice chat, 16-player game servers.
for the core titles.
So it definitely sounds like they're trying to build this thing up.
And as far as I know, it doesn't cost money.
Here's the thing, though.
The games I've noticed on my phone that do support this, it kind of gets in the way.
You only have so much real estate on the iPhone screen.
And I sort of get annoyed when I try to launch a game and I get this whole register now for open faint.
And I'm just like, fuck off.
I want to play my Commodore 64 emulator.
I don't need VOIP to play The Last Ninja on the Commodore 64.
Get out.
So some of it is kind of annoying.
They need to tone it down a little bit.
It's nice that it's there.
This technology is cool.
I think it's great that they're bridging the gap.
But don't throw it in my face.
Stop.
Have it a little button in the corner that I can use.
I guess it hides once you do kind of sign in it's just annoying I don't like trying to go into a game for the first time and it's like sign up like Tap Tap Revenge 3 I tried playing for the first time and it's like sign up for Tapulous and connect to your Facebook and like fuck off I just want to tap my screen and time to stuff
What are you looking at over there, DarkSakura?
Is that that?
Epic Citadel.
Oh, the Epic Citadel thing we were talking about earlier?
That's pretty damn nice.
Nice.
Maybe I'll take some screen captures.
We'll see.
Let's see.
I have no idea how to pronounce this.
BetaCNCRA says, I don't care about ads.
They should go die.
Go away ads.
Well, I understand that ads are what it takes to support some free things, but some of these open faint games are things I pay for, and that's where things get really annoying.
So I'm just saying.
Anyhow.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to chat with us live here at Orange Launch Radio as we tape our super long episode today, Labor Day weekend.
DarkSakura, you're going to have to put that down and talk about what you've got in gaming news.
Like...
Hey, can you give me a chance to finish?
Well, you know, American McGee is doing another Alice game, Alice Madness Returns, but it's going to be not over the top, so they're saying.
It's going to be adult and mature, but it's definitely going to be an M-rated title, but it's not like they're doing it just to make it an M-rated title.
They want it to be
with the established universe but have it be something more for an adult to grasp.
Not for kids.
It's not Disney.
They don't want to make it extra violent, extra gory, extra bloody.
They want the content itself, the subject matter to be where it gets the M rating.
If that makes sense.
I think it's going to be fun.
I mean, it's not going to be like over-the-top Mortal Kombat style blood, but they still, you know, Alice is still going to cut things, right?
I'm sure if she stabs something, it'll bleed.
Just won't, you know, gush a geyser of blood.
I'm really not sure how to take a news story like that.
It's like they're saying, like, well, we're not trying to go for a mature rating, but our game will have mature content, but it's necessary to the plot.
That's like telling an actress, like, your topless scene is integral to the plot.
Like, it's...
It always is.
It's artistically important to the story that you're naked in this scene.
Highbrow is what we're going for.
Exactly.
Highbrow boobies.
When the killer gets you in the shower, you see you need to be topless because you're in the shower.
I'm talking about dealing with mental illness or an abusive childhood.
Topless scenes or Alice?
No, I'm talking about... I agree.
The type of topic, though, considered mature and adult would be something like, the character herself is supposed to be kind of nuts and living a very unhappy life.
In a brothel full of topless women.
Well, usually the protagonists in Silent Hill games, once you finally find out what their origin is, it's like, whoa, that's really messed up.
He did what to his wife?
Yeah.
Or like the little girl who...
Her special bad guy was the daddy chained to the door with the knife trying to do dirty things Takeo Rei in our chatroom says the 3D boobs in Piranha 3D were very important to its plot It was!
That's a movie I haven't seen yet but I think I need to even though I think a lot of those gore movies are kind of stupid like when it knows it's over the top sometimes they're really funny
Sometimes you gotta have boobs in there just to show your cheese.
But what I don't understand is that there's actually a version... This was great.
It was in the local paper.
They were talking about the local drive-ins and how they're still going.
And they were showing Piranha at the drive-in, but it's not 3D because you can't do 3D on a drive-in screen.
And they were interviewing this lady who took her... It had nothing to do with this fact, but it should have.
She took her 6- and 8-year-old to go see Piranha.
Yeah.
and I'm not one to tell you what to do with your kids, but at the same time I couldn't help and look at that but go, really?
That's bad parenting.
You're going to take your six-year-old to go see Piranha and it's not even in 3D.
Does that make it better?
I don't know.
And then you take them to the lake the next day and then they don't want to go to the lake anymore.
DarkTetsuya says, oh, speaking of gore movies, apparently Saw is getting a 3D version.
Oh, do not want.
I heard that.
Do not want.
See, I like it when it's over the top, but I don't like it when it tries to be real like Saw does.
Do you want to see Machete?
I want to see Machete!
Jarrah Gage in chat says, Machete has fake Lindsay Lohan boobs.
I heard there was nudity from Lohan in that.
As I described Machete this morning, it's a movie based off a trailer, based off a fake movie.
Definitely want to see it.
Hobo with a Shotgun
Alright, moving on.
Loki and me and then the mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.
Oh yes.
So, you know, of course, the Microsoft summer gaming thing worked out really well for them.
So they're going to do it again, but this time in the fall.
And they're going to call it the Microsoft Xbox Live Arcade Game Feast Promotion.
And there will be, of course, a bunch of games coming out.
It's, I guess, starting September 29th.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, I like free.
Free is good.
Finally, also Super Meat Boy will be coming out October 20th to wrap the whole thing up.
That'll also be 1,200 Microsoft points.
Hopefully, we'll be able to give you guys previews on each of these games soon because I've played most of them already.
We'll talk about them in coming weeks.
Alrighty.
Any of those games you think are worth buying based off of what you played so far?
Comic Jumper was kind of fun.
It was a beat-em-up game.
It has a really neat looking... It's kind of like a comic zone, but HD-ish.
The main character's kind of weird looking, though.
He looks like a Ninja Turtle, almost.
Ninja Turtle crossed with...
I don't know, some sort of Flash Gordon and Deadpool.
And then Super Meat Boy is supposed to be really good.
I was just disappointed that it was broken.
It won't stay broken forever.
Yeah, it'll fix it eventually.
And Hydrophobia, I don't know about Hydrophobia.
Hey, price drop!
The DSi and the DSi Extra Large are going to be getting a hiccup at a bad time.
In North America, the DSi and DSi Extra Large are getting a price drop.
It's effective September 12th, so not just yet, but real soon.
The handhelds will now be $150 for the DSi and $170 for the DSi XL.
Time to clear out that inventory before the 3DS comes out.
and then the 3DS will come out and I'll have to buy that too so it's a win-win so yay price drops and all that good stuff alright let's move on to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails and you know if we feel like it we'll read them
No, we all, of course.
Of course we're going to read emails from you guys.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
We're going to have DarkSakura open up the old mailbag and dive in and pull out a letter right now, but not until I play the music.
Well, we actually got two emails, but I figured maybe in two hours I'll check the mailbox again.
Periodically Hello, OLR I can finally listen live to your show OLR starts at 3am on Monday in Belgium Still, I can't call in tonight I'll wake everyone Show starts at 11pm Anyways, I have a question for Loki
I have all Sega guns, Light Phaser, Menacer, Stunner, Virtua Gun, and the Dreamcast Gun.
My problem is that none of these guns, except for the Menacer, work on newer TVs.
I currently don't have room for an old TV, so I was wondering if I could make these guns work on a modern LCD TV.
And I'll just go ahead and close the email.
Thanks for a weekly OLR, you guys are so awesome.
Cyber Beast, Belgium.
No, you can't.
That's unfortunate, but you're not going to be able to do that because newer guns that they have out now basically kind of have little light sensor bars or some sort of sensor bar that attaches to the TV that you would use.
It's like Wii style.
Yeah, it's like the Wii or even if you want to go even older school like the Power Glove.
It's basically just something because they can't do the refresh stuff on the TVs anymore, so that's
What the solution is now.
So, unfortunately, you're not going to be able to use those on newer TVs.
And that should answer the question.
Last email.
Hey, guys.
Molten Brown here.
Ew.
It could be chocolate.
I was just listening to your last show and I wanted to take a shot at figuring out THQ's warped reasoning.
Perhaps to THQ, the amount that they sell to their distributors depends on how many people will buy the game new, since the distributors will only buy what they think they will be able to sell.
If the distributors are having a hard time unloading the new game because people are buying it used, then they will decrease the amount of new games they buy from the producers.
This means that in the end, THQ and other producers will get less money since distributors are buying less of their game.
While I don't agree with this reasoning, nor THQ's stance towards used gamers, I can... I'm thinking of used gamers, like the gamers themselves being used.
I can... I feel so used today.
I'm spent.
By this program.
I can kind of see where they are coming from since they are in the business to make money.
Sad though it is, that's what it boils down to.
Well, keep up the good work and hopefully next time I will be awake enough to send a longer email with some questions.
Your dutiful listener, Molten Brown.
The not gross version of Molten Brown.
Sadly, I don't think that's the case at all.
And here's why I don't think that.
Because the first game that they pulled that on was UFC 2010.
And really, they wouldn't have announced it to anybody until the day the game was released, except the fact that Destructoid got a hold of, I guess, a source of somebody who purchased the game before the street date and found out that it had this whole thing on there anyways.
They weren't going to tell anybody about it until last minute.
Thank you for watching!
and so on and so forth.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If you can't make your online service better within the $60 price point, then you need to raise the price of your games.
Whether that's popular or not with your consumers, that's the risk you're going to have to take if that's really an issue for you.
But really, it doesn't come down to making their service better.
As far as I'm aware, the UFC stuff, I don't think they've really done anything to their online service and made it really awesome.
I don't think anyone's going, oh my god, the online UFC is so sweet.
This is way better than every other game I've ever played.
I don't think that's the case at all, and I don't think that's ever going to be the case with this stuff.
It's just an excuse that they're using to try to justify charging you an extra $10 if you buy the game used.
Breakman in our chatroom says, quite simply, if that's a plan to drive up sales, it's not a very good plan.
Yeah, I mean, that's what it was, because they...
If that was their intent, was to drive up new sales, because the way it works, it goes either you're going to have your direct consumers or your direct retailers that you're working with, like the GameStops and whatever, or the distributors that they're working with.
So either way, they have customers that need to place orders with those companies.
Then those companies say, okay, we have X number of pieces on order.
Here's how many pieces we think we need.
What we have on order plus a little bit of extra of a pad to sell later on.
And that's what they placed with the actual publisher.
If their intent was on driving up new game sales, then they would have let that news out a lot earlier so that people would go, oh, okay, well then I need to buy a new version of this game instead so that I can get my online content for no additional price, which really doesn't make any sense anyways.
Um, so that would be, they would have to do that in order for that to actually be true, but they didn't, and, you know, now they're even talking about raising the price, you know, from five to ten dollars, so...
I think it's just a big old cash grab.
That's all it is.
At some point, the video game market is going to crash under the weight of all this.
It's because they think they need some extra money.
They think that, oh, hey, well, we can make money off of each used sale because these damn used sales, they're cutting into our new game sales.
Well, I don't know if that's the case at all because I think a lot of people that are planning on buying those used games weren't going to buy your game new anyways.
Exactly.
Regardless of the fact that you don't have...
You know, online or online's extra or something like that.
You know, they may just say, you know what?
I don't need that game at all.
And then they'll be resentful against you and not buy your product going forward.
So it may have a negative impact.
And I think, overall, it's not a really good move.
But a lot of people are going to move that direction anyways.
All right.
Let's move on to, I guess, appropriately following up all this ranting, a segment we do here on the show every week called the FUs of the Week.
Gross.
F you to having to take algebra.
Not that it's a hard class, just that I hate math.
Loki?
F you to people that drive really slow in front of me or that are lost and don't seem to know where they're going.
I hate people that all of a sudden just cut over a couple lanes because they missed their turn.
You know what?
If you miss your turn, you need to make a U-turn and then correct it that way instead of just going, oh my god, and cutting off everybody.
I don't really have a lot of angst, so I'll go with the driver FU too.
FU that SUV that totally cut me off merging onto I-80 today.
She was a bitch.
Alan?
F you to hot weather, I guess?
I don't know.
I'm pretty mellow right now.
It's because you live in Silent Hill.
I do.
Where it's always cold.
Yes.
And I'm not lying.
When you drive up the hill to get to Alan's house, it suddenly gets foggy.
It could be the middle of August and it's like fog.
Bradley, how you doing over there?
Do you have an F you?
I have an F you.
I'll have no free time starting Wednesday again for a few months.
Why's that?
My second job starts up again.
Oh, good times.
Good times.
Alright, good luck.
Alright.
Alright.
That's it for the FUs of the week.
A few more news stories and then we'll get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
It won't be the first time tonight we'll be taking calls, but we will take some calls.
Alright, Loki, what do you got?
Retro City Rampage is a game that they're showing off at PAX right now.
It's a WiiWare game that originally was supposed to be an NES title that was going to be a port of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then something happened where that didn't end up coming out.
Now it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 type of game, but it's now just all sorts of references for different 8-bit games are in here.
It's supposed to be coming out on WiiWare in December, but I mean they have everything from Contra references to Metal Gear to just...
All sorts of neat gameplay.
It just looks really cool.
And it's all done in kind of an 8-bit style.
And once again, actually that was the Grand Theft Auto 3 that ran on the NES is called Project Grand Theft Endo was the original thing.
But it's really, really cool.
So definitely worth checking out once it comes out.
I hope it does actually come to Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network as they were saying.
That looks like a sweet game.
It actually does look really sweet.
I like those games that kind of get in the retro.
Although, I don't know, I wasn't super duper into the Scott Pilgrim game for some reason.
It was okay, but I don't think I played enough of it actually.
So, I don't know.
You're going to be picking this up, though, Loki?
Yeah, I haven't really played the Wii in a long time, but I definitely... Mine's still not hooked up.
I didn't even buy the new Metroid.
I know that might be shocking and awe, but I'm kind of just waiting for it to come out on Xbox 360.
Like, in my mind, I'm like, it'll come out on the 360 at some point, right?
Or the PS3?
I know, I know, I'm being stupid right now, but yeah, that's it.
And Ranma's yelling at me saying, you need to play more Scott Pilgrim.
I know, I do.
All right, going on to one more story before the calls, you guys.
The Fast Racing League is something coming out on WiiWare.
It's the Futuristic Fast Racing League.
Hmm, what could this be?
It's Jet Rocket, I guess, is the folks that make the game, or is this?
No, no, that's the other game they made.
Shin'en is the name of the company.
They're making this game called Fast Racing League.
All there is is promotion art, but there you go.
My thought when I look at this, though, is that, gee, somebody's making F-Zero for the Wii.
It's that they're not just calling it F-Zero.
It's fast, racingly.
It looks like Wipeout to me.
Super fast.
Well, Wipeout's kind of like F-Zero in a way.
Yeah, it's all the same type of stuff, but, I mean, the vehicle design looks like Wipeout.
You know what, though, that they need to be able to play that perfectly is a Nedcon.
Seriously.
Nothing is like playing Wipeout with a Nedcon.
There you go.
Tonight is coming up later during our marathon, so we'll get into that.
Unless there's any late-breaking news from this morning.
I don't know if Loki has anything he wants to share from that.
I guess we can do that.
But otherwise, we're just waiting for the calls to come in at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
And we'll be taking your calls.
This is probably not the first time tonight that the Skype line will be open, but it's open right now.
So there you go.
Borderlands level cap's going up from 61 to 69.
Nice.
For free.
Why isn't Borderlands an MMO?
Usually when I hear about level caps going up, I go, oh, it's like an MMO.
Although, Borderlands kind of plays like a Warcraft type game, doesn't it?
Except it's like first person, but doesn't it have the whole exclamation marks over people's heads and all that stuff?
Andy, you've played this game a little bit, right, Alan?
Yeah, Borderlands is pretty much like Diablo if Diablo was a first person shooter.
You know, you shoot someone and the number of how much damage you do and hit points appears over their head.
Loot is random, so you gotta go through all the loot that you get and drop the trash.
It is pretty fun.
Yeah.
I was really glad to hear that Gearbox, makers of Borderlands, got the Duke Nukem Forever contract.
Because I'm a huge fan of theirs, because they're the ones... Oh yeah, see, I forgot that they made Borderlands.
Oh, well, Duke Nukem Forever is going to be fucking awesome then.
Yeah, because they did the Half-Life, Blue Shift, and Half-Life... God, the one with the Marine.
The other expansion, I'm blanking right now.
I'm a huge Half-Life stan.
So anything that Gearbox does, because they're sort of a part of the Valve family, I'm going to be all for.
Whereas I don't think I've played a lot of their games.
I'm not sure.
All right, we're getting some calls.
Let's go to the Skype line and see what's up.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Ranma.
Just want to know, is it happy hour yet?
Not yet.
I'm still waiting for my drink.
I was supposed to get an hour and a half ago, but that's okay.
It's all good.
You're still waiting?
I already started.
Did you?
What's the drink of choice for you right now, Ranma?
Since I have to grill tomorrow, I've been doing nothing but rum and Pepsi all night.
You have to grill tomorrow?
I didn't know you were a chef.
I thought you worked at a retail store.
I haven't worked retail in about three, four months.
You're at a restaurant now?
No, I'm talking about tomorrow.
I'm breaking out my grill.
Oh, Labor Day Barbecue.
Yes.
I'm just slow.
Hi, Dan.
Oh, Dan just walked into studio.
How are you doing, Dan?
I'm doing good.
Good.
Are you going to be joining us for more of the marathon later on this evening as we move on and take over your house for a night?
I don't think I have much of a choice.
Awesome.
Sounds great.
Yes!
Alright, so what types of games should we play a little bit during the marathon tonight?
Because at some point I think we're going to move into the vault, I don't know, or out in the living room, I don't know what DarkSakura has planned.
I told Dan to hook up Saturn for me.
Alright.
The Saturn's hooked up!
Woo!
It's in the vault!
What are you going to play on the Saturn?
Big TV!
Alright, anyhow.
I'm playing Xbox on the big TV.
Alright, I gotta get back to the call.
We'll talk more with Dan later.
Yes?
Stay black!
Yes, sounds good.
Oh god.
Boy, last week's show was interesting.
Anyhow, so what's on your mind today, Ranma, besides the whole happy hour?
I'm actually a little bit pissed at some of the people today.
I'm really pissed at people that are bitching about the $10 price increase on Xbox Live.
Why are you mad at them?
You're only paying $60 a year for this.
I understand why the price is going up.
Microsoft is actually putting the money into the infrastructure for improvements.
In order to make those improvements, something has to go up.
Unlike these other software companies who are trying to jack extra money out of us because of used games, they can kiss my ass for all I care, but that's besides the point.
Yeah, I was going to say, it feels like we're getting nickeled and dimed in every possible place here.
And it's like, I'm okay with Microsoft raising the price because they haven't in so long and they've been supporting it fairly decently.
But then when I hear this online pass stuff is being allowed too, I get irritated.
You know what I mean?
Exactly.
And if people are complaining about it, like you said, buy the cards now or do what I do.
Join Reward Zone.
They have a gamers club.
You buy games.
You get points.
When you hit $150, you get a $10 gift card.
Use that toward your live.
You save $10 that way.
So try to find different ways to exploit reward systems and point cards and all that good stuff, right?
Exactly.
Plus, Microsoft does do a buck a month deals.
Those have popped up.
Oh, that's true, huh?
I think I've seen those.
Yeah.
I saw it pop up on my dashboard on April Fool's and I tweeted about it.
Everyone thought I was lying about it.
I'm like, no, this is legit.
Here's a screen cap.
Interesting question from Derek H. in our chat room.
What are the odds that when Reach comes out there will be problems connecting because Xbox Live is overloaded?
Then we'll see just how good their infrastructure is, right?
I haven't seen it go down yet, you know, so I don't think there will be much of an issue.
I'm trying to think if it ever has gone down.
Has Xbox Live ever gone down in a non-preplanned way?
I'm sure it has for a little bit.
Yeah, there was a few times.
Never like anything too epic, right?
It was always at weird times, too, wasn't it?
It was like around New Year's or something.
I think this year it was having issues.
I will be interested to see though.
I mean, Derek has a point.
If it goes down, then this whole fact that they're charging the extra money to improve their infrastructure is kind of a line, isn't it?
Well, yeah.
If it goes down, that would suck because you're really not going to be adding too many people to the actual live service.
You're just going to have people playing a different game.
And Derek says it happened with Halo 3 and Halo 2.
I don't remember it happening with Halo 3, but then again not to sound like that guy, but I had it a couple days early so I was playing it a little bit earlier so maybe I didn't notice it.
But sometimes they try to do outages in advance to plan for this stuff, but...
I do remember a couple of times Major Nelson has said there's been issues with live and within an hour or two everything is back to normal.
Because they know they're going to have to get hell with all these people paying for it.
Whereas the PlayStation, if stuff goes down for them, it's free anyway, right?
Also, there was a few times on 1 vs. 100 where they had problems with that.
Oh, really?
Yeah, because it was kind of weird that it was doing that, because in their beta seasons they had like 150,000 at one time, and it was working fine probably back then, but it was like 50,000 that was coming in per time, and it didn't work for like two weeks.
Interesting.
I don't remember that.
But then again, I was kind of one of those people that played it more when it first came out.
And then later on, I was like, oh, it'll always be here.
I'll just play it next time.
And then, oh, now it's gone.
No more of that.
Forget that.
Oops.
That's one thing I'd hope with this extra $10 is they'd add something that's like that to replace it.
I figured we had to have that at least once during the marathon.
You know what?
I've decided that I am so sick of DarkSakura always having her stupid Vuvuzela button here on the program that what I've decided to do is that I've actually decided to counter DarkSakura a little bit here and I actually have my stadium Vuvuzela noise.
You are such a dork.
So we can have dueling Vuvuzelas on the show.
That's going to be amazing.
We'll do that, Rob.
Great.
I'm sure the listeners are so excited.
I am glad.
I'm glad conventions have banned that thing.
Turn off.
There we go.
It won't shut up.
Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with us for now?
I'm sure you'll call in later, but, you know.
Well, I have another story.
I can say that when I call back later.
Actually, we're supposed to be doing an outbound call right now, so I'm going to let you go for now, but call in later and give us that story.
Because we do still have more stories, too, that we're going to talk about a little later.
Wonderful.
Great.
DarkSakura.com
and yeah we're three hours in and usually at this time there's another man live at All Games Radio and some people might be tuning in to try and hear him but you can't he's not live tonight the man is Bobby Blackwolf the host of the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio and he's not live tonight because he's at Dragon Con this weekend so sorry fans of Bobby who don't listen to us you don't get Bobby tonight or do you we're going to call him right now actually and try to get him on the show
So you can have a mini Bobby Blackwolf show.
So, two ringy dingies.
Hey, Bobby, how are you doing?
It's your buddy Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, I'm doing great, how are you guys holding up?
That's what, hour three?
Yeah, it's on a schedule, it may cut you off later, I don't know
Oh great, just what we needed.
Who knows how long the marathon will be going tonight.
When All Games Radio decides to cut it off, we'll be done, I guess.
We'll see what happens.
Try to tweet Channel Z. We'll see what you can do for that.
Well, I figured since you're not able to do a show here live at All Games Radio because A, you're gone, and B, we took over, I thought maybe you'd want to do the mini Bobby Blackwolf show?
I can talk about what's been going on here at DragonCon and some of the neat stuff that I've done and something that we're actually going to be running next week.
Awesome.
Wait, hold on.
I didn't even know.
Hold on.
This is very important breaking news here at the OLR Marathon.
I believe I've been given a glass of liquor.
What is this?
This is my first booze of the evening.
What is this?
It's a double shot of tequila and... It better be Patron.
It is.
Okay, okay.
Okay, good, good.
I hate cheap tequila.
Sid, why?
And it's a peak grapefruit juice.
That's a tasty beverage.
All right.
I'm making more.
Who wants one?
Sorry, Bobby.
I'm making more.
I just...
There's beverages here.
Don't worry.
I don't feel left out.
Yeah, I was going to say, you sound like you're either kind of tired or maybe you've had a beverage or two yourself.
I don't know.
I actually haven't had a beverage today.
I found a quiet place kind of to be.
and then I realized this quiet place is right next to security operations for the hotel.
So I'm kind of trying to keep it down a little bit.
Ah, I see.
Okay.
All right.
Well, what's going on at DragonCon?
I know you want to tell us a little bit about what's going on over there at the show and some of the stuff you've got for your own show next week.
Well, basically, I mean, DragonCon, it's a big, it's, you know, take ComicCon and take out really a lot of, like, the industry stuff.
This is a fan convention.
There are a lot of celebrities here.
I haven't stood in line for any of those panels or anything.
I've actually been here staying away from video games, staying away from computers.
The game I've actually been playing most recently, I don't know if you've ever played this game, it's a card-slash-role-playing game called Are You a Werewolf?
Have you ever played that?
No, but it sounds interesting.
Loki, are you a werewolf?
It goes by another name.
Some people know it as Mafia.
It's the same rules.
Oh, God, wait, I have played a game like this.
No, when I played it, it was just called Werewolf.
It's a very popular forum game, right?
It's the thing where, like, you have a group of 12 people, right?
And, like, three of them are wolves.
And, like, every night, everybody votes to lynch one person.
And if the wolves are the last people standing, they win.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They win.
Yes, I've seen this game played before.
That's from 2 a.m.
to 9 a.m.
Okay.
Okay.
and then I sleep a little bit and about 1 o'clock I get up and go to the dealer's room and stuff like that so that's really what I've been doing staying away from video games there is a video game room here they do have consoles here that people can check out games use games from the game store that's running it from Tennessee but really it's not really the focus of DragonCon there are no game companies exhibiting here so there's not that much video game type stuff going on here
However, and this is the cool thing, I just got an interview, which we're going to run on my show next week, which, by the way, guys, is 25 minutes long.
Woo-hoo.
Do you remember, did you ever remember, in Dave and Buster's, the Battletech Centers?
Absolutely.
Dan absolutely loved that thing.
I love Virtual World.
And he was pissed when it was taken out.
I have the entire story on why it was taken out and where all those pods went.
Ooh.
Because there are eight Battletech pods downstairs, 24 hours.
right here at DragonCon.
Oh, wow.
That's awesome.
And they are still making updates.
The game actually looks a lot like MechWarrior 4 on the PC now.
They're actually, the software company is still working on new updates.
They're going to bring back Red Planet very soon as well.
And I got the story of, you know, where they travel and, you know, because basically Enthusiast bought all the pods after Dave and Buster's canceled the contract.
And the short story is
Dave and Buster's decided that they no longer wanted to have anybody working the Midway.
Everything had to be self-sustaining and so the Battletech they decided did not renew the contract with Virtual World so they were going to sell all the pods and all these enthusiasts came together and said we'll buy this set and this set and now all the sets are all over the country and some of them are mobile now.
Wow.
Huh.
And so I have a 25-minute interview with an owner of a set of 16 pods
8 of which are traveling 8 of which are in a center in Houston and we talk about you know because he was just a player and they got the funds together to buy it and they travel the country with these pods and they do maintenance on the hardware and they do the community thing and do the whole Battletech Center stuff so they're keeping the Battletech dream alive and we're going to have a long nice very good interview with him next week on the Bobby Blackwell Show
I'm excited to hear it
Dave & Buster's Jr.
Well, that's going to be an awesome interview, Bobby.
We're looking forward to that next week.
What else is going on at DragonCon?
Did you end up on a panel after all, I heard?
What's this?
I did.
The panel they had put me on was the kickoff panel, which was Friday at 1 o'clock, and I actually had to work until noon.
Dope.
And so I was all packed and everything, and I left at noon to get down here, and the trains were held up a little bit.
So I actually walked into the back of the panel at 1.15, and the place is packed.
They do call me up at about 1.15, 1.20.
I haven't even gotten my badge yet because the badge line is five hours long for pre-registration.
That's the one thing DragonCon hasn't figured out is how to pick up your badge.
I went up, did the panel, did the last 30 minutes panel.
The room was packed.
Would you like to know why the room was packed?
Why?
It wasn't for me.
This is the key.
If you ever want to have a packed panel, have Veronica Belmont on it with you.
Nice.
So she was there, huh?
No, because she was there with the Swords and Lasers podcast.
It's kind of the one that's her independent podcast.
So they're here.
They actually did a live show in a large ballroom today at 4 here.
But she was on the panel and stuff.
And so I talked a little bit about what we do at all games and stuff like that.
but yeah the place was packed and it's because Veronica was there and like when it was over everybody was rushing to get their pictures with Veronica and all that stuff so I did get to speak on one panel but that was it so my official obligations were done at 2 and I didn't even have my badge yet at the time
One of the few podcasts that I will admit to listening to, because it is pretty good, is The Instance, which is one of the World of Warcraft podcasts that's out there.
And she was actually on, they recently had a big Buku, yay, hippie, hurrah, 200th episode.
And she was on that.
And I was kind of like, oh, yeah, this is kind of interesting.
So, yeah.
Well, cool.
She does a lot of independent stuff.
I mean, yeah, she's been hired by CNET.
She works for Core, but she still really loves doing all the independent stuff.
That's awesome.
That's a good way to do it.
Good for her.
What about, like, are there any other type of record-breaking things going on there, like no Thriller dances this year, or what's going on?
Well, they can't do Thriller because the Thriller record's currently 12,000.
Mexico City set it to 12,000, so the 900, whatever they did here.
I don't know how they did, well, I mean, obviously, we won't know how they did until Guinness verifies it, but they did a
they did two existing records and they tried to set up a brand new record the two existing they wanted the most Star Trek characters in one place and the most superheroes in one place and then they created a new one of most steampunk characters in one place because steampunk's really kind of the new goth here at DragonCon everybody is steampunk and Gears and all that stuff so it used to be just Neo-Victorian and then they added all the technology to it so those are the records that they've been trying to break
but I don't know exactly how those have been going.
Sounds like fun though.
Good times.
Now, I will say I did go in the dealer's room.
There is a dealer that actually had a lot of, going back to the video game thing, a lot of rare Nintendo games, Super Nintendo games, things like that.
He actually had Earthbound for the NES.
Oh wow.
He was selling it for $130,000
and I did not get it in time.
I came back ready to get it and somebody else had bought it.
Oh, that's awful.
But it was the actual limited edition NES release of Earthbound.
He's got Little Samson.
He's got an NES core test cartridge.
So one of the test cartridges that the service centers had and he's got that for $3.50 which is a lot more than it ever goes on eBay but it's very, very rare.
but I did buy something from him Nintendo related and it's not exactly rare and you know once people see exactly what it is it's not going to sound as cool as it would when you first see it but I'm going to save that for Friday night on Friday Night Gaming oh a little tease there alright so Friday Night Gaming if you want to check that out this Friday at fnglive.net right?
Yes, and the main game we'll be playing is Metroid Other M. Because it's effing live.
But I'll be showing this game that I picked up here at DragonCon for a pretty penny.
And I overpaid a little bit, as you can expect, for con prices and stuff.
I looked online how much it is, and I could have gotten it online for a lot cheaper.
I'll tell you where you can get it once we show it.
But yeah, he had all the Mega Mans.
He had... I can't remember what...
Super Nintendo games he had like Little Samson I guess is a really rare NES game he had that in the box sitting in there so there's some rare stuff that I found in the dealer's room and I just can't afford it all we're actually looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I apologize to Bobby's fans I kind of have one eye on the all games chat room but I'm not able to follow there's a lot of chatty chat going on there right now but let's see Breakman says Earthbound for the NES and Bobby let him keep his life he got lucky hmm
Well, I bought this other thing first.
It was my first priority and then I came back and it was gone by the time I had come back the next day.
That's too bad.
You'll have to find the guy who bought it and end his life.
Alright, so if you're the guy that bought the Earthbound on the NES cartridge at DragonCon, Bobby's looking for you.
That's right.
I want Earthbound Zero sometime.
All right, well, Bobby, we don't want to keep you from the convention too much longer, but anything else you want to say about the convention or your show or anything for the folks listening?
Not really.
I mean, you know, DragonCon, it's been a fun time.
There's a lot of great costumes.
I have not seen Brad from PodCulture yet.
I know he's here.
He's out having dinner somewhere tonight, so I didn't get to, you know, I haven't been able to say hi to him.
But, I mean, no, and here's the great thing, Rob.
Hmm.
They moved PAX next year.
Did you notice that?
PAX got moved.
I did not.
It's back to its original weekend.
It is the last weekend of August next year.
It is not Labor Day weekend.
It's the weekend before.
Interesting.
Flights are cheaper.
Yeah, flights will be cheaper.
That'll be great.
Oh, I might have to do that next year then.
So I'll be able to make it out there and here and I don't have to worry about which one I'm going to.
So I was very happy about that.
I've been trying to keep an eye on PAX News and stuff.
I'll believe the dude can confirm everything when I see it.
They've got video from the show floor.
It's nuts.
I'm just, you know, then they can say, oh, by the way, yeah, it won't be coming out for another 10 years.
But it's the guys who did Borderlands now.
And, you know, we were kind of discussing earlier when it was our lead story tonight, as you can probably imagine.
We were kind of talking about how, you know, it's probably not really the same game 3D Realms was developing.
It was just kind of like, okay, well, we've bought this IP from the slaughter of 3D Realms.
Let's just take all these art assets and the idea and see what we can do with it.
And now you actually have a game because it's not the same game.
One last thing, I wanted to do my show this week mainly because I wish I was doing it because Microsoft has been showing a hell of a lot of balls this week.
How so?
With the new controller and the Xbox Live
What was that?
Yeah, Microsoft is just showing a lot of balls this week, and I'm like, damn, they had to do this on the week I'm not doing anything.
No, he is not here.
Nobody else from FNG was able to make it up here.
Derek H asks, is it true that as Chris Gore said, DragonCon is a sluttier version of Comic-Con?
Probably, yes.
Have you seen a lot of hot sluts?
I will make you really have some fun.
Oh, yeah.
Here's the thing, Rob.
The saying goes, if you don't get laid at DragonCon, you're not trying.
Okay.
Yeah, I've heard that those furries can get pretty aggressive.
It's like the Ren Faire.
Just walk into one of those little gift party rooms and you'll have a good time.
Thankfully, I have not seen a single one of them.
You haven't seen a furry?
Well, because they're all too busy at the orgy.
That's why they're... If you haven't seen a furry, you're not trying hard enough.
and they don't need a Craigslist posting to get that going they can't now Craigslist has censored the adult services section now on Craigslist apparently so there you go you don't need that here it just happens alright Bobby we're gonna let you go have fun at DragonCon have a blast especially for us since we're not there since it seems like everybody else is going to some convention but us and we'll have a drink in your honor a little later alright
Excellent.
I'll have a drink in your honor over here, too.
Sounds good.
All right.
Have a good one, Bobby.
See ya.
All right.
Bobby Blackwolf, the man who is usually live right now at All Games Radio, but it's a special weekend.
It's Labor Day weekend.
We're doing a marathon.
He's at Dragon Con.
Scott's at Burning Man.
Most people are at PAX, but we're right here in the OLR studios.
Boy, aren't we having fun together.
Actually, there's quite a few of you listening tonight, so I really appreciate that.
It looks like you guys are with us here.
So we're going to keep going and take some more calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lawns Radio.
We'll get in at least a couple more calls before the next break and before we say goodbye to Loki for the night.
And then we'll – I don't know what we'll do.
I'm thinking maybe for the next segment, DarkSakura, I don't know what you think of this.
Maybe we'll go into the vault and just pull some random games and talk about them.
Okay.
Maybe like gaming memories or whatever.
Okay.
But we also, we need to take the chat room into the vault somehow.
Do we have a laptop or anything?
I got, well, I have mine out in the car.
Yeah.
I can do that.
Okay.
Do you know that you have the password to your Wi-Fi so we can?
Yes.
Okay, good.
Good deal.
We'll do that.
And then you get to hear what it is.
Do they have like an app or something on the iPhone that you can do like adjust in TV or something?
There is...
Yes, I have a Ustream.
We've actually had for several years, and I guess now's the time to say it, we've had a secret Ustream channel.
It's not that secret, it's just that before we went to Justin.tv, literally the week before, I reserved a Ustream for us, but we opted to go with Justin.tv because that's where the All Games Network went.
And it seemed like most of the folks in the shows that we're related to and so forth all went towards Justin.tv, so we went there for the whole Synergy thing.
because it was kind of the same thing.
Now that that isn't really the case anymore, some of our fans still broadcast on Justin.TV, and I think that's really cool, but I did get a Ustream application for the phone.
I actually did a test run the other night just to see how well it worked.
The video quality is kind of poop, but it does let you stream over 3G.
So it's kind of neat in that regard.
So I don't know.
Maybe we'll broadcast.
But I think the video quality is such poop, and we're a radio show.
I don't know if it's really worth it, to be honest.
If you associate your iPhone with the Wi-Fi here, would the app then associate with the Wi-Fi?
It would, but my concern is that it's going to choke the stream.
We were having those problems earlier when the feed was unknowingly broadcasting.
Yeah, we've had an Orange Lounge Radio Ustream for like three years.
We just don't use it.
There you go.
And I actually kind of agree with Derek.
Justin kind of sucks now.
It's just not quite what it used to be.
A Ustream has sort of established itself as the definitive place to go for streaming.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I really would have to explore.
We haven't had video so long now ever since we switched studios that I'd really have to explore that.
So we'll see.
All right.
Anyhow, I didn't mean to get off topic.
I was waiting for calls, but none are coming in.
How are we going to do a marathon with no calls?
Damn it, people.
Call!
We'll try to get at least one more call in before we say goodbye to Loki.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call, but if you don't get in now, that's okay.
We'll open it up again around the usual time, about 8 o'clock later this evening and so forth during the OLR marathon.
We also have some more stories we're going to do.
Um...
If I have time to write them while other people are talking and I'm not so intoxicated after that drink, we will do some OLR games.
We need a listless topic.
We can think of that later.
Totally.
And we should do match game.
We'll do match game.
We have at least four people here.
With Dan, we'll have five.
So we can do a match game.
And we could also do Mad Libs.
You never did do OLR Mad Libs.
Oh, the phone is ringing and my back is turned.
I can't even see it.
Shame on me.
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Haseo Haseo Oh, Haseo's, okay, hey, how you doing?
I'm doing good What is on your mind, my friend?
I just want to say that roleplaying quests are a bitch Roleplaying quests are a bitch?
What game are you playing right now?
I am playing a free-to-play MMO called Mabinogi
I have never heard of this.
You've got to tell us a little more about this.
Is there a website you can download this at or anything like that?
Yeah, the nexon.mabinogi.com.
They also do MapleStory and... So is this a very MapleStory-esque kind of game, or is this more Warcraft-inspired, or what's this game kind of like?
It's like Warcraft meets anime.
Interesting.
That could be interesting.
And it's free?
Is it ad-supported, or what's the deal?
It's 1% free.
You can upgrade to a membership for a month, which gives you a possibility to run a guild, open shops, use a bag, whatnot.
Cool.
But this game is being a pain in the ass right now?
That's why you're saying that role-playing quests are a bitch?
Yes, because each expansion is...
Interesting.
What turns you on to this game?
How'd you find out about it?
My friend actually plays it, who I was PBPing against.
Quickly, what other games types of stuff are you into?
I play just about anything except for anything that has Hannah Montana or Barbie attached to it.
You know the Hannah Montana game on DS is apparently pretty sweet, so I don't know, just saying.
I heard there was a music game on the DS that was actually pretty sweet, just saying.
Hannah needs to burn.
Any other party words for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
Neutron movie will be epic.
It better be, because DarkSakura and I are planning an epic trip that will probably preempt the show to go on this stupid trip, so stay tuned.
Alright, thank you so much for the call, Haseo, and stay tuned.
Are you going to listen for a few more hours to the marathon tonight?
Yes, I'm listening to the whole thing.
Awesome.
The whole thing.
Good luck, buddy.
All right.
Take care, my friend.
All right.
Thanks.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
We can fit in one more call.
Why not?
We got time.
We got a lot of time.
A lot of time.
1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
Have we figured out the whole dinner thing yet?
Are we doing a... We're going to get taken bakes.
Awesome.
Someone is going to make the Papa Murphy's run.
Okay.
When I sober up, I can go, but that's going to take me at least another hour.
Okay.
But I can't drink anything until then.
You want some Triscuits?
That would be lovely.
Okay.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
Loki's going to be leaving us after we go to the next break.
I should really take a nap when I get home.
I woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning this morning.
I was going to ask, what is it that you're going to be doing when you go home?
Babysitting.
I'm really watching the baby.
Probably go to bed at like... You know, I always say I'm going to go to bed early, but it ends up being 11.
I'm going to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods if I can.
And I have to go grocery shopping because we have nothing in the house.
And then what else do I have to do?
Maybe bid on something on eBay.
Bid on something on eBay.
Good stuff.
I might be... I should be getting a Kinect camera in the next few weeks.
Ooh, good luck with that.
And this is not one of the beta cameras.
This is actually the real retail camera with the retail version of Connect Adventures.
If the guy doesn't deliver it, though, then I will get my money back.
Something's going on.
We might not be broadcasting right now.
It looks like our Winamp is frozen.
I'm not seeing anything in chat.
But let's just keep going for the podcast's sake.
I don't know what's going on.
If folks can hear us or what have you, but it looks like... I'm keeping up with the chat room.
Shit.
All I saw, the last thing I saw was somebody saying parting words for Loki.
Did you see anything after that?
That's all I saw.
I didn't see that.
Something's wrong.
So they're not hearing us right now.
I'm going to start and stop our feed.
Yeah, it says my nickname's in use already.
Shit.
I'm disconnected.
Okay, that's not good.
So we're going to reconnect.
We're going to reconnect right now.
How many times is this going to happen tonight?
Oh shit.
And I reconnected using the wrong encoder.
That's real good, Rob.
Real good.
Live radio, the joys, the perils, the heartache.
The Trials, The Tribulations Okay, we're back up.
We're live.
So slowly folks are going to be coming back on.
That might explain why the Skype line hasn't been ringing if our internet just suddenly decided to crap out.
Alright, it looks like I'm reconnecting slowly but surely.
I've been on AIM the entire time.
It just died again.
It died again?
I've been on AIM the entire time and had no problem.
It shows that we are connected on Shoutcast.
This is bad stuff.
It says auto-accessive connections from a single host.
Oh, fuck.
G-line from Game Surge.
So we got booted from chat altogether because there's too many of us trying to connect because our ghosts were still lurking there.
That's great.
So we might have just lost the chat room for the rest of the evening.
That is wonderful.
Those G-lines reset after like 10, 15 minutes.
It really depends.
Do they?
Yeah.
Have some driskets, Rob.
Great, so now we have to marathon with no chat room.
This ought to be lovely.
For now.
Well.
Well, that sucks.
Gotta go now.
Alright, this is great.
If I probably load the Twitter, there's going to be a million people tweeting going, Try it through the web browser, because that uses like a proxy thing.
Oh, does it?
I'll do that.
I need someone to help me fill time here real quick.
I'm going to web chat.
Sometimes that works.
I'm sorry, we're all here chewing on Triscuits.
Yep, that's the marathon.
It's just going to be like eight hours of this.
Chewing on Triscuits and Rob hunting down a way to get in.
Well, I need to get our chat.
The chat's like, oh God.
It wants me to install Java.
Let me try to reconnect here real quick on the old-fashioned way.
See if that works.
We need chat.
Our skypline is supposedly open, so if somebody can hear us, you can call us.
Shit.
Yeah, no, it's showing that we're G-line still, because I guess too many of us were on at once.
We're up, though, according to... Try the chat app in IE, maybe, if it's on that machine.
Because Java may be separate for Firefox, if that's what you're using.
Oh, I will do that.
Our Skype line is still open.
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm hopping in web chat.
Your mic is also dying a lot.
I'm in web chat.
I'm trying to get there anyway.
Are you?
It still says G-Lined for web chat.
Oh, we're getting at least a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio.
Who's this?
It's Ron McGinn.
Just call me your support team staff because that's pretty much what I am.
You again.
All right.
Well, we're up, right?
You guys can hear us again?
Yeah, we can hear you fine.
It's just that the whole G-Line thing, because that happens when there's more than three or four people from the same IP that logs into the chat.
Which is custom that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki will all log in, but unfortunately when we tried to log back in after we got booted from our internet, we all got G-Lined.
We don't have a chat right now.
I just sent you guys a tweet on how to circumvent the whole thing.
It's not working.
It still says G-Line.
Don't we just have to wait like 15 minutes and we'll be fine?
DarkSakura.com
Hello, this is Eric Hatcher, a.k.a.
Tridane.
I've been a long-time listener, but I'm a lurker, mostly.
Oh, well, hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
This is a heck of a night to call in.
We're just having technical difficulties left and right.
We can't see our audience right now.
Well, that's part of the reason I called, I guess.
If I sound out of breath, it's because I'm on the walking track, and I'm using you guys to pass the time while I work off the weight on my lord-ass gaming butt.
Wow.
What types of games are you into?
What types of games do you play?
Oh, just a little bit of everything.
Pretty much all the modern systems, I'd say.
Mostly the Xbox 360, and of course I get my MMORPG still from EverQuest.
Still EverQuest after all these years?
Why EverQuest?
Well, I guess it's because of the people I know there.
I've been on the same server for 11 years now.
And it's probably the people that keep you coming back, huh?
Really, that is exactly what it is.
I agree 100%.
Exactly why I kept playing for so long.
I don't know.
I just caught the last 20 or 30 minutes or so.
Something I guess I'd like to talk about is, I don't know if y'all are familiar, there's a game that came out within the last couple of weeks, last week or so, called Elemental, the War of Magic.
on the PC.
It's had a lot of trouble.
I think I've heard of it.
Yeah, I don't think I've played it.
I know I haven't played it, but I think I've heard of this.
Tell us a little bit more about this game.
Well, it's by the company Stardock, and Brad Wardall is probably the lead designer on that, I believe.
Pretty nice guy, but this is the worst, most buzziest piece of software I've played in the last 20 years, I guess.
Whew!
playing computer games, which is very unfortunate because the game has a lot of potential.
If any of you are familiar with Masters of Magic, it's sort of a civilization-like game with a fantasy bent.
Ooh, those are like all of my favorite games you just said.
Exactly, and it has so much potential, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.
That's too bad.
I hate it when you've got a game that sounds like such a good idea, like on paper, but then in execution it sucks.
Ah, exactly.
Yeah.
Anyway, I just mostly called to help you out with a little bit of time.
I appreciate it.
I guess I don't really have a whole lot to say.
That's alright.
Wait, where'd you say you're calling from?
Oh, big pardon?
Where'd you say you're calling from?
Oh, basically Birmingham, Alabama.
Really?
From my home state then?
Yeah.
Oh, exactly.
Now, I've spent many, many a time up in Birmingham, although I spent more time around Dothan and Montgomery.
But yeah, Mobile's my hometown.
Nice to talk to someone from my home state.
Welcome.
Woo!
Nice talking to y'all, and I look forward to listening to you more as the evening progresses.
All right, sounds good.
You have a good one, buddy.
Thanks for tuning in.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
All right, bye-bye.
I can almost always pick out an Alabama accent.
So I was like, bing, radar.
Nice.
Alright, well we're going to go ahead and go to a break.
I just downloaded an IRC chat client to my phone to try and connect.
Oh, there we go.
I got it.
and they're saying, wait, did Loki, yeah, I can see chat.
So I have chat open on my phone right now.
So I finally have a lifeblood into the chat room.
So there you go.
So chatters, I can now see you again.
Don't send me private messages.
If you figure out what my name is on there, it's not too hard to figure out.
Don't send me private messages.
Oh, we got another call coming in.
This will be our last call before we take another break.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is Toy Gak.
Hey, Toy Gak.
How are you, buddy?
What's on your mind?
I just called in because I'm going to give you the URL you'd need to go to to get the G-Line removed.
Okay, what is that?
It's gamesurge.net slash utils slash G-Line.
Alright, I'm looking at that right now.
Oh, 1G line found for your host, resolved in an hour.
Okay, so I'm on that page and it says why we're banned, okay.
It will only last one hour.
So there you go, we just have to wait out the hour then.
Jerks.
That's okay, so we got till 625 with no chat, but that's okay because I got chat on my phone.
I figured it out, I worked around.
Just a reminder, it's probably a bad idea to circumvent the G-line because they can tell.
I'm on my iPhone.
It's 3G.
It's okay.
We'll be okay.
We're not on Comcast.
It shows us 3G.
It'll be our little secret.
Alright, well thanks for the tip, we appreciate it.
At least we know it's only for an hour, so we know we'll be able to get back in.
Alright, have a good one buddy.
Okay, bye.
Thanks for the tip.
Alright, we're gonna, on that note, I think we need a break after that, oh boy.
Alright, people are saying hi.
Why were you banned?
Well, they don't like more than three people on the same IP.
Drew Nami's got it there.
And they're saying actually it's five, says Toagak, but I don't... It says three on the page that explains why you're G-lined.
Weird.
When various clients try to reconnect and disconnect due to internet issues within a certain amount of time, the server has no way of knowing what's going on and it kind of thinks it's a DDoS.
It's a denial of service.
It's just a failsafe.
I'll forgive them someday.
I'll find it in my heart to forgive them.
We're going to actually say goodbye to Loki at this point before we go to another break.
Loki, any final words for our listeners tonight?
No, I just have to go get groceries.
That's always fun.
Because I don't like chores.
Alright, well good luck with all that.
This is actually the part of the show where we would be saying basically goodnight for listening.
This is kind of the end of the normal part of the show, if you will.
We're going to be getting into the more random stuff.
So if you're just looking for your normal quote-unquote edition of Orange Lounge Radio, this is kind of the end of that part.
But we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Now just so you know, for the podcast feed...
We're going to be releasing the marathon in bits this week.
So you may not see everything up right away.
So just give it a little extra time.
If you're done listening to this part of the podcast and you want more, just give it a little more time.
That's all we need.
Real quick, I was going to say we're having our game summit, my work game summit thing.
We do it usually each year and we have the game publishers coming out and talking about stuff.
So maybe I'll learn some new information and we can share at appropriate times if you know what I mean.
All right.
And that'll be something to look forward to next week, yes?
Possibly.
And also, hopefully, I'll have a new iPod by then.
All right.
Well, I don't know.
Should I play the closing song that we usually play at the end here?
Play our little closing song?
Go for it.
Sure, because you've got to put it on the podcast anyways, don't you?
I guess that's true.
So let me see.
Now I have to cue that up.
That involves work.
so goodnight everybody thanks for listening we'll be back though if you are listening live or on podcast or whatever we still got the marathon coming up and plenty more show who knows what randomness is going to happen when we don't have a chat room going on here and some folks in chat are saying goodnight and they're waving even though you can't see them and I'm getting everything up from uh
Let's see, Toagak says if my IRC server was up, I would let them bounce IRC off of me.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Somebody should put up like a fake server that we can go on and at least see our chat room still.
Yeah, my roommate has a Linux box running in the spare bedroom.
Oh, really?
So I could shell into that and we can IRC from there.
That might be a good idea, but I'm not going to worry about it too much.
It's just an hour, right?
We can make it an hour.
We can do it.
Alright, we're going to play our outro, say goodnight, and we'll be back though with more of the OLR Marathon right after this.
See you next week!
See you next week!
