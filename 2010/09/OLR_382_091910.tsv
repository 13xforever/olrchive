0	20240	Tonight, September 19th, 2010, a much-hyped MMO shuts down after only three months.
20240	24440	Konami and Harmonix settle their rock band lawsuit, and the Nielsen Report rates the
24440	31800	effectiveness of ads and video games.
31800	35920	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35920	36920	Radio.
36920	40180	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
40180	45360	We meet live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby
45360	49560	Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, except tonight actually we didn't
49560	52680	meet after the Bobby Black Wolf show because he's on vacation.
52680	53680	How dare he?
53680	56840	Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours.
56840	62560	Say hello to my awesome co-hosts, the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.
62560	65400	How are you my friend?
65400	66400	That good, huh?
66400	67400	I'm doing fantastic, Rob.
67400	68800	I'm glad to hear it.
68800	70120	And how are you today?
70120	71760	Super, thanks for asking.
71760	72760	Great.
72760	76960	Alright, also joining us, as he does every week, say hello to the one and only Techmaster
76960	77960	Loki.
77960	79240	That last fry didn't taste good.
79240	83560	I'm sorry to hear that, but I heard you exclaim literally as the opening credits are rolling
83560	87200	on our show, I hear Loki go, ooh, bonus onion ring.
87200	93600	Yeah, because they mixed, they contaminated my fries with an onion ring in there.
93600	94600	You don't like onion rings?
94600	95600	Onion rings are the best.
95600	96600	No, I do.
96600	101400	I just wasn't expecting an onion ring, because I'm expecting their bland fries.
101400	102840	That onion ring was a nice add to both.
102840	106000	Now I could get just onion rings, but I do like their fries still, even though they are
106000	107000	bland.
107000	110160	Another episode of Orange Lounge Foodio here as we tape live.
110160	112820	Pretty busy weekend gaming, thanks to the Tokyo Game Show.
112820	116440	There's a lot of news and stuff going on here in the States as well, just like so much to
116440	118160	talk about tonight.
118160	121960	We supposedly have some guests coming, but I got a text that they're running late, of
121960	125940	course, because these people always run late, shh, don't tell them, but I'm assuming they'll
125940	129480	be here any moment, so we'll introduce them whenever they show up.
129480	133500	They probably won't come into the studio quietly, so I apologize in advance for any derailment
133500	136280	that is bound to happen on this lovely radio program.
136280	138540	It's okay, I dressed up.
138540	141160	Let's talk, yes you did, you went all out today.
141160	144440	Alright, she's wearing her pajamas just so you guys know.
144440	148200	Alright, let's start it off with how was your gaming week and the types of video games you've
148200	151180	been playing this week, and I know DarkSakura finally jumped into something because I got
151180	154560	a text message earlier this week that let me know she did.
154560	156120	So what's up DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
156120	164280	I started Final Fantasy 13, and I got to the part where they transformed into special people,
164280	167880	so that's as far as I am right now.
167880	172840	And I'm playing The Sims 3 right now because Dan got me ambitions, and Dan's home from
172840	175400	his trip and I'm so happy.
175400	177560	And that's it.
177560	180920	So Final Fantasy 13, what do you think of the battle system, it kind of takes forever
180920	182400	to get going doesn't it?
182400	187600	Yeah, I'm like, the game that plays itself, I'm just going to sit back and eat some rice
187600	190320	and watch a movie.
190320	193960	Which is basically how I've been treating it, it's like oh it's a movie that I can push
193960	196240	a button every so often.
196240	200600	Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, you know it's you guys that really make the
200600	203400	show every Sunday night as we do Tape Live.
203400	209000	And go to lovely comments such as the following from Spazinator PSN in chat, if Jamie's doing
209000	213440	fantastic then I'm Betty fucking Crocker, she sounds like frustrated as all hell.
213440	222040	No, I had a long day yesterday because it was Yom Kippur, and so it's basically, to
222040	227760	sum it up in a nutshell, it's the day of atonement, so basically you apologize a lot and don't
227760	230440	need anything.
230440	233840	That's putting a really simplistic view on it.
233840	240080	It's really, it's very beautiful service, I was very happy to have attended all day,
240080	243000	and I was very happy to eat when the sun went down.
243000	246800	So after 24 hours of fasting, Betty fucking Crocker sounds pretty good, huh?
246800	248960	More like 20, 26 hours?
248960	249960	25?
249960	251420	Oh, but who's counting?
251420	252420	More sundown than post-sundown.
252420	256440	Yeah, well, you end up counting.
256440	261680	But it was a really nice experience, it was good, but I had to get up early this morning
261680	264120	and record the other podcast.
264120	265120	And then I had-
265120	266120	That other show.
266120	267480	Oh, bite my butt.
267480	274280	And then I had to, I had to talk with my client for a little while, and then I just said like,
274280	276120	forget the world, I'm taking a nap.
276120	278380	And then I've got to do algebra homework tonight.
278380	280400	And three poster designs tomorrow.
280400	285440	Speaking of other podcasts, the Rob and Extefer Warcraft show is supposed to start this week,
285440	288020	but sadly we ran into some technical difficulties.
288020	289020	We can't seem to do Skype on my computer.
289020	290020	Don't break my pen.
290020	293080	I can't, I can't do Skype, I'm frustrated, no.
293080	296400	I can't do Skype on my home computer like I can on the one here in the studio.
296400	299560	So we weren't able to do our little thing, so I don't know what we're going to do.
299560	302080	We'll figure it out, we're smart people.
302080	303080	Just in time for Cataclysm, how appropriate.
303080	304080	Are you smart fellers?
304080	305080	Huh?
305080	306640	Are you smart fellers or fart smellers?
306640	307860	Shut up.
307860	312900	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki, and how was your gaming week?
312900	313900	It was fine.
313900	319720	I got my iPod finally, so I downloaded a bunch of stuff on there.
319720	326080	And let's see, I tried a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies, because I have yet to jump into
326080	327080	that.
327080	328080	It's pretty fun.
328080	331480	Hopefully going to play a little bit more than that, other than like two minutes worth.
331480	336920	And then, what else did I play?
336920	343000	I played some of the Mirror's Edge game on the iPhone, which is kind of neat, very simplistic,
343000	348040	but it still has that kind of same look as the full game.
348040	353200	Fruit Ninja, because that's really easy and casual.
353200	356480	So I actually kind of downloaded that, because it's actually one of the ones that is supported
356480	361640	by Game Center, so I thought it'd be neat to try out.
361640	368020	And of course I had to download Robot Unicorn Attack, because, well, I don't think I need
368020	372080	to explain myself there.
372080	376600	It's so surreal to me that you're coming in here and playing with your little iPod now.
376600	381360	This is after like a good, I don't know, eight years of just Apple hatred that you see on
381360	382360	this show.
382360	383360	No, I still hate Apple.
383360	385960	But you're sitting there playing with your iPod, like, hey Rob, let me see what apps
385960	388520	you have, because I'm going to say, oh, Jamie, let me see your phone.
388520	390080	It's just really funny to me.
390080	393880	Well, okay, it's very convenient for browsing the web.
393880	400140	For example, Nellie's mom came over, and she's like, I need the 800 number for AAA.
400140	403400	And Nellie was like, okay, well let me boot up my laptop, and I'm like, okay, hold on,
403400	407480	let me real quickly just turn my iPod on, hit the web browser, done.
407480	411680	There's a AAA app that will actually put your little ID card in there and everything, and
411680	414240	you can actually file a request over the application.
414240	419800	Well, it wasn't, she didn't need, it was kind of weird because it was someone hit her that
419800	425640	had AAA, so she needed a number to call them, got it.
425640	429720	So yeah, so it's neat, and then the other thing that I got with that is I got a Virgin
429720	433120	Mobile MiFi 2200, which is a 3G hotspot.
433120	437800	In fact, I'm actually using that right now to connect to the web.
437800	443000	It's literally, it is smaller than the iPod that I have right now, but it works pretty
443000	449680	well, and it's like 40 bucks a month flat, so I'm kind of digging that a little bit.
449680	456500	Console Games, of course, played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's just a given.
456500	460400	Really ain't playing too much else other than that, because I just haven't had time.
460400	468400	Wife's keeping me busy with keeping the baby, you know, out of her hair, and unfortunately
468400	474720	that gives me like no time to do anything, so it's just, I'm really sad because I wanted
474720	478720	to work on stuff this weekend, and instead I had to go shop for groceries for like two
478720	482800	hours and run a bunch of errands, and then I come back home and she's like, I've been
482800	487240	sitting here with the baby for all this time and he won't stop crying, here you take him.
487240	491640	It's like, oh yeah, I haven't been doing anything at all, I've just been, you know, playing
491640	492640	around.
492640	494760	That's what you get for making babies.
494760	495760	Breeders.
495760	502480	So, yeah, so that's basically all I've done this week is mainly download a ton of apps.
502480	507320	I've spent way too much money on apps, so that's for sure, I gotta cut back on that.
507320	511800	This little 3G router thingy-ma-bobber you have, what is this again, a Virgin mobile?
511800	516600	Well, it's called a MiFi 2200, they have them through Virgin, they have them through Sprint,
516600	522840	AT&T I think even, and, but the plan that's the cheapest is actually the Virgin plan,
522840	531840	and it piggybacks on the Sprint network, and it's flat $40, and it's, you know, there's
531840	537000	no plan, so if you wanna use it, you pay 40 bucks and you get a full month worth of unlimited
537000	539480	bandwidth, unlimited data, whatever.
539480	542200	Now what surprised me about that is when I was looking at those things online, I thought
542200	546120	they were the size of like a normal router, was my impression, but that thing is smaller
546120	549320	than your phone, or not the phone, well, than an iPhone.
549320	550320	Yeah.
550320	551320	It's crazy.
551320	555040	And, you know, literally I slip that into my back pocket and I just play around with
555040	556040	it.
556040	557040	Jamie's gonna take a picture of it for the website.
557040	560620	Put your thing next to it to compare sizes, because I was really impressed at how tiny
560620	562960	that stinkin' thing is, it's crazy.
562960	569560	Yeah, so, um, yeah, it's, it's really small, um, and it's kinda cool about it though is
569560	573920	SeeSense, you know, I have like almost like a ghetto iPhone with this, because I have
573920	579120	a program to, uh, send free text messages, so I can do that, and I have like a number
579120	583520	that's associated with that now, so people can text me if they want to, um, and...
583520	586480	You should give out that number here on the show and see what kind of text messages you
586480	587720	get during the week.
587720	588880	I really don't use it.
588880	591720	Hi, Loki, I'm in the potty!
591720	594440	I think that would be quite foolish.
594440	601400	Uh, yeah, so I have that, and then, um, I don't know, I've just, I've been downloading
601400	605100	a bunch of junk, because that's what I, I sit there, you know, I have the baby in my
605100	609240	arm, and I'm sitting there just kinda browsing the internet, and I'm like, okay, hmm, what
609240	614680	apps could I possibly need, um, oh, I know, they just talked about a police scanner app
614680	617120	on TV, I'm gonna download that, okay, uh...
617120	619120	He's an alcoholic.
619120	620840	Pretty much, it's...
620840	624080	And then in two months the novelty will wear off, and I'll be like, ugh.
624080	627320	But hey, it doesn't matter though, because I didn't really pay any money for this, although
627320	631300	I did spend a lot of money on apps, so Apple still wins in this.
631300	635540	Going back to our chatroom and chat.orangelandrader.com, they always make A-plus comments such as this
635540	636540	one.
636540	642400	Alf in chat says, now Loki's butt will have cancer, and I'm assuming that's from the router.
642400	643400	I don't always...
643400	647760	Being in your butt, or next to your butt, or wherever it is, in close proximity to your
647760	648760	butt, will somehow give you butt cancer.
648760	652800	Well, I can't really use it too much, you know, in my back pocket, because, um, if I
652800	660040	sit down it turns it off, so, uh, that's not good, um, but you know, that's where I store
660040	661040	it for now.
661040	665440	I don't store it in my butt, but my, but my pocket, yes.
665440	669480	But if somebody did store it in their butt, they'd be like 3G everywhere they go.
669480	671480	But it's so cool though, because see, like, not only can I...
671480	672640	You can name the network Rob's butt.
672640	677560	Not only can I connect to that, um, but other peop- it can sort of port up to five devices
677560	678560	at once.
678560	682600	Um, I'd imagine it'd be very slow with five devices connected to it, but...
682600	685040	Hey, I'm connected to your butt right now!
685040	689360	Alright, um, let's introduce the guests, because they're dying to make a comment, and, uh,
689360	693240	it's been forever, really, since these two have been on the show, but they're quite the
693240	696740	duo, and if you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, I'm sure you've heard
696740	699600	these guys on the show, they're loved by the masses.
699600	701440	Not really, I just say that to talk about...
701440	703640	Say hello to Rice Princess!
703640	704640	How are you?
704640	705640	I'm good.
705640	706640	So if you put it up...
706640	707640	Wait, can we hear you?
707640	708640	Oh, it's muted.
708640	709640	Hi.
709640	710640	La la la.
710640	711640	Jerk.
711640	712640	Hi, how are you?
712640	713640	I'm good.
713640	716600	So if you put the router up your butt, what if you accidentally poop it out, and it goes
716600	717600	in the water?
717600	718600	That...
718600	719600	Wouldn't that break it?
719600	720600	Maybe it might.
720600	721600	Have to change the network to big dump.
721600	722600	It might.
722600	723600	Oh, and hi.
723600	724600	Alright.
724600	726880	Also, say hello to the one and only...
726880	728160	The doctor is back!
728160	729160	I'm the doctor!
729160	730160	How are you?
730160	731160	Pretty good, pretty good.
731160	734960	And I just wanted you to say, Rob, there's- Rob's butt has been a network for years and
734960	736960	years and years.
736960	741680	That's pretty much the only com- Only, uh, yeah, I'm seeing the Sonic Screwdriver, which
741680	743760	would also work in Rob's butt, so...
743760	744760	So I'm gonna play with the Sonic Screwdriver.
744760	745760	Here you go, Rice Princess.
745760	749280	You know, I am not comfortable with how much of the discussion on this show is about my
749280	750280	butt.
750280	751280	I, uh...
751280	752280	I'm not okay with that.
752280	753280	It's your own fault.
753280	754280	It really is.
754280	755280	Yeah.
755280	756280	Alright.
756280	757280	Well, what have you- what the hell have you been up to, Rice Princess?
757280	760040	Were you- you have been on the show in like a year, it seems like, because I don't think
760040	763000	you've been since we've been here at Studio Sakura.
763000	767920	I haven't, and I'm kind of insulted that you didn't notice that the doctor and I are wearing-
767920	771240	You are wearing Madison Castlevania shirts, because it's old school and new school.
771240	775480	Yeah, mine's better, but- Isn't today a special day in the, uh, relationship between you and
775480	776480	the doctor?
776480	782000	Yeah, it's the first time we had sex, because he's straight.
782000	783000	And me?
783000	784000	Really?
784000	785000	I thought it was- Yes.
785000	788860	No, September- September 9th, 2000- Oh my gosh.
788860	789860	Was the night we all met.
789860	790860	Oh my gosh.
790860	791860	Yeah.
791860	793640	I thought it was Irene I met in like November.
793640	797600	Yeah, and then we all- we all went back to your apartment and played Wheel of Fortune.
797600	798600	Good times.
798600	799600	In Roseville.
799600	800600	And butt sex.
800600	803320	Rob's network was on that night.
803320	805320	Shut up.
805320	807160	And I've got a- I've got a gift to regale you with.
807160	808160	You can open later.
808160	809160	You didn't have to bring gifts.
809160	810160	Well, that's alright.
810160	811160	But I'll take it.
811160	812160	It's poop.
812160	813160	Yay.
813160	816600	So you're wearing matching castle- well, they're not matching Castlevania shirts, it's old school
816600	817920	Castlevania new school.
817920	820520	Mine's Symphony of the Night, so mine's automatically cooler.
820520	821520	Yeah, his is old school.
821520	822520	But his is great.
822520	823520	Yeah, no.
823520	824520	I like his too.
824520	826000	That means we have to push the start key now.
826000	827000	Oh yeah.
827000	828000	Alright.
828000	829000	Where is the start key?
829000	830000	I'm not gonna ask where that is.
830000	831000	But where is the start key is the question.
831000	832000	Finding is the game, actually.
832000	833320	That's- that's the other game.
833320	834960	That's a scary game.
834960	835960	Yeah.
835960	839200	Since you guys haven't been on the show in a while, we actually have some new listeners.
839200	843520	Believe it or not, like people actually like subscribe to the show and stay subscribed.
843520	846200	Is it the same five people under different names?
846200	850660	No, we've got emails and like people are like, hey, I just started listening and my first
850660	852360	show was the fuck show and I'm like, really?
852360	854280	And you didn't unsubscribe after that?
854280	855280	Yeah.
855280	856280	That's amazing.
856280	857280	You're weird.
857280	860800	So for those that maybe haven't heard you on the show before, what kind of video games
860800	861800	are you into?
861800	862800	What do you like to play?
862800	864760	What- what- what types of stuff you've been playing right now, Rice Princess?
864760	868480	I don't play anything now except for WoW because, you know, I have a love-hate relationship
868480	869480	with it.
869480	875360	But I like, um, like Super Nintendo games, Nintendo games, like stuff- older stuff.
875360	876360	Retro stuff.
876360	879200	Yeah, I don't- I haven't really played much on the newer gen.
879200	882640	What would you say is a totally underrated retro game?
882640	883640	Clash at Demonhead.
883640	884640	I knew you were going to say that.
884640	885640	Of course you knew I was going to say that.
885640	886640	Duh.
886640	887640	Why is that game underrated?
887640	890520	Because it's fucking awesome and no one's played it.
890520	893960	Did you- did you get a little hot when you saw that the band in the Scott Pilgrim movie
893960	895320	was called Clash at Demonhead?
895320	898720	Yes, because I was probably the only person in the theater who's actually played that
898720	899720	game.
899720	900720	It was awesome.
900720	901720	Yes.
901720	902720	I liked it a lot.
902720	903720	Yes.
903720	904720	Good times.
904720	905720	What about you, Eddie?
905720	906720	How about The Doctor?
906720	907720	The Doctor, what types of games have you been playing lately?
907720	913480	Not much lately, because like The Rice Princess, I own a Wii, so I'm a very angry Wii player
913480	915120	because there's no games for it.
915120	918680	I looked at my Wii history for the past six months and it's just Netflix.
918680	923360	There's no games being played, but before that I had downloaded Cave Story in the virtual
923360	926760	console which is a really fun 8-bit style game.
926760	927880	So yeah, I like a lot of old school stuff.
927880	933000	I like the new stuff, I just don't like Halo and Call of Duty and stuff, so I like adventure
933000	935760	type games and there's not a lot of that on the Wii.
935760	937280	It's mostly a soccer mom console now.
937280	938720	What about Metroid Other M?
938720	939720	That was the big thing.
939720	942880	I've heard terrible reviews on that though, like I want to play it, but I've heard terrible
942880	943880	reviews.
943880	944880	I don't know what you guys think.
944880	947600	I'm a little worried because it's supposed to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid and
947600	950320	I've heard a lot of awful things about it, but I've heard some really good things about
950320	951320	it, so I don't know.
951320	956880	I've heard play-wise, it's fantastic, story-wise, it's balls.
956880	958680	And not the good kind of balls.
958680	959680	Ray D.N.
959680	966080	Silver Gun in our chat room says, I get it, says you should get Sin and Punishment 2.
966080	967840	I get it.
967840	969000	How about Sin and Punishment 2?
969000	970240	I don't know what the hell that is.
970240	971240	It's on the Wii!
971240	972240	It's Sin and Punishment.
972240	973240	Okay, I still don't know what it is.
973240	974240	Not you, him!
974240	975240	Oh, fine.
975240	976240	Screw you, it's for him.
976240	977240	It's a shooter.
977240	979920	Yeah, it's another shooter, which, you know, I'd play that if I wanted to go to sleep,
979920	980920	so.
980920	981920	Alright, fine.
981920	986480	I don't trust the industry nowadays, because remember how they said Shattered Memories was
986480	989120	like the best game at E3?
989120	990840	Fucking worst game ever made.
990840	993600	Oh, I just want to punch Silent Hill.
993600	995640	What was wrong with Silent Hill Shattered Memories?
995640	996640	Everything.
996640	997640	It wasn't a game.
997640	1000360	It was just like, here, I'm going to poop on your face.
1000360	1004480	I don't remember the poop on your face scene, actually.
1004480	1007720	I remember it, because that's all that happened over and over.
1007720	1008720	I don't.
1008720	1012520	Like, oh my gosh, oh, Alessa, it's you, poop on your face!
1012520	1017200	It's like, you son of a bitch, you got me again!
1017200	1020440	I thought it was going to be different this time, but no.
1020440	1021960	Did you and I play the same game?
1021960	1024040	Because I just remembered the snow and a lot of running.
1024040	1025040	I don't remember.
1025040	1027760	You didn't see the tracks of shit everywhere?
1027760	1028760	No?
1028760	1029760	I don't.
1029760	1030760	Okay.
1030760	1031760	Yeah.
1031760	1035680	Maybe I got the director's cut or something, I don't know, but I got the shit on your face
1035680	1036680	version.
1036680	1037680	Okay.
1037680	1038680	I'll stop cussing now.
1038680	1039680	Alright.
1039680	1040680	No, that's alright.
1040680	1041680	It's a family show.
1041680	1043520	Let's see.
1043520	1044520	My gaming week.
1044520	1045520	Exposure!
1045520	1046520	Exposure!
1046520	1047520	Let's see.
1047520	1048760	What types of stuff did I play this week?
1048760	1049760	Who cares?
1049760	1050760	No.
1050760	1051760	Not a lot of news.
1051760	1052760	Wow.
1052760	1053760	Wow.
1053760	1054760	Wow.
1054760	1058560	I played the WoW beta today because I finally got my character to copy over, so I was able
1058560	1059960	to look at the new zones.
1059960	1062800	Have you done any of the sillies or the flirts?
1062800	1063800	They are raunchy!
1063800	1064800	For the new?
1064800	1067880	Yeah, for goblins and wargons.
1067880	1068880	I haven't.
1068880	1073360	I played a wargon at like level six, and I got all excited because female wargons showed
1073360	1079800	up this week, but you can make one and see what it looks like, but you can't actually
1079800	1081400	click the button that says create character.
1081400	1083240	Yeah, it says decline or whatever.
1083240	1084240	Yeah, invalid.
1084240	1089560	But it's not a PG-13 thing anymore.
1089560	1092520	It's like getting into R-rated material.
1092520	1096600	One of the female goblin, I think it's a flirt, was like, yeah, and then he asked me to go
1096600	1100840	up on him, and I'm just like, what the hell?
1100840	1101840	That's pretty funny.
1101840	1102840	Maybe you're just getting too old.
1102840	1106400	No, but then there was another one where he's like, I've got something for you, and then
1106400	1108400	he just unzips his pants.
1108400	1112640	That's just straight up sexual.
1112640	1114600	That is not teenager stuff.
1114600	1118120	And then Rob was like, let's release the sassy squad, and he took his pants off.
1118120	1120520	Did I quit playing well at the wrong time?
1120520	1121960	I don't have the sassy squad anymore.
1121960	1122960	I'm a paladin.
1122960	1123960	I know.
1123960	1124960	Boo.
1124960	1125960	But you have the sassy hair.
1125960	1131480	No, but Alan plays the boomkin now, so he has a sassy squad, but that's not what they're
1131480	1132480	called.
1132480	1134600	Not nearly as sassy as you're- No.
1134600	1136440	He actually is really good.
1136440	1138720	He really is a great boomkin.
1138720	1139720	He's a big fucking geek.
1139720	1141140	I'm not just saying that because he's listening.
1141140	1143360	He knows what he's doing in that game.
1143360	1144360	I don't know.
1144360	1145360	I just push three buttons.
1145360	1146360	I'm a hunter, you know?
1146360	1149360	But he's like, oh, you just do this to raise your hit cap, and blah, blah, blah.
1149360	1151360	I'm just like, what?
1151360	1152920	Speak English.
1152920	1159440	No, but here's the thing is that the beta, I started playing the beta today with my paladin
1159440	1161320	and going into some of the new Love Lady areas.
1161320	1164560	So I went to Mount Hijal, right, and started fighting some of the new monsters.
1164560	1165760	Wow got hard.
1165760	1166760	It did.
1166760	1172480	But all of a sudden, I went from having two heals to having six, and I don't know which
1172480	1176960	one to cast, and then my rep paladin is all like, oh, now you got to have holy power to
1176960	1179760	do all this shit, and oh my God, they changed everything.
1179760	1180760	It hurts.
1180760	1186200	They did, and Extifer, our buddy Extifer, he tried to heal for one of the raids, and
1186200	1190440	he's like, I couldn't keep anyone above 50% health, and blah, blah, blah.
1190440	1193520	I'm like, I don't really know what that means because I'm not a healer, but that sucks,
1193520	1194520	I guess.
1194520	1195520	I don't know.
1195520	1199720	You make it sound like it's terrible, so I guess it is, but yeah, he was saying it was
1199720	1200720	really hard.
1200720	1201720	But you know what I have?
1201720	1202720	Photon torpedoes.
1202720	1203720	Nice.
1203720	1204720	Whatever.
1204720	1205720	Well, I've got quarantined torpedoes.
1205720	1206720	Whoa.
1206720	1207720	Actually, I'm using transphasic torpedoes.
1207720	1208720	Ah, I hate you.
1208720	1209720	All right, I didn't...
1209720	1210720	Star Trek Online?
1210720	1211720	Why aren't you playing Star Trek Online?
1211720	1212720	Maybe you're bigger.
1212720	1213720	Yeah, yeah.
1213720	1214720	Because he doesn't play MMOs.
1214720	1215720	Oh, he doesn't play MMOs.
1215720	1216720	He tried playing WoW for like a week.
1216720	1217720	You know what he did in WoW?
1217720	1222400	He would hide in the Moonwell ponds and do shadow meld, and when someone would run by,
1222400	1224720	he'd go, boo, and come out of shadow meld.
1224720	1230720	That was the extent of his experience in WoW.
1230720	1232640	Why didn't he play on a roleplay server?
1232640	1233640	You know why?
1233640	1238560	Because his computer lagged so hard, he would run in place like eight times.
1238560	1243400	I had my computer at like 200 megabytes of RAM, and so it was like, I couldn't play WoW,
1243400	1244400	so it was terrible.
1244400	1245680	So that's what I did.
1245680	1249720	You know, I had to upgrade my graphics card and everything to run Star Trek Online decently.
1249720	1250720	Oh, really?
1250720	1251720	Yeah.
1251720	1255800	And the chat room's all bitching, like, oh, I don't understand what you're talking about.
1255800	1256800	You lost me after Pally.
1256800	1260840	I'm going to go play Shattered Memories and get shit on on my face.
1260840	1261840	So let me move on.
1261840	1262840	Just kidding.
1262840	1267300	Oh, and then SSG100Matt says, at least it's better than Final Fantasy XI.
1267300	1268640	That's totally true.
1268640	1269640	That's not saying much.
1269640	1270640	What about XIV, huh?
1270640	1271640	Oh, that gem.
1271640	1273640	Let's not go there.
1273640	1276560	All right, and then I played some iPhone games.
1276560	1280160	Actually, speaking of MMOs, I played a new iPhone MMO that's so much better than the
1280160	1281400	one I played last week.
1281400	1284460	This one is called I forget the name.
1284460	1285460	It's called Legends.
1285460	1286460	Wow.
1286460	1289240	I think that's short for something else.
1289240	1290880	Player Legends or Play Legends or something.
1290880	1292000	It's free.
1292000	1293000	It's neat.
1293000	1294160	It's got 3D.
1294160	1296400	It sounds unique and not generic at all.
1296400	1297400	Not at all.
1297400	1298400	But you know what?
1298400	1299400	It was free.
1299400	1300400	So I'm not going to complain.
1300400	1301400	And then I played Netflix.
1301400	1302400	You played Netflix?
1302400	1303400	Yes.
1303400	1304400	Alan and I started watching Hoarders.
1304400	1305400	Oh, my God.
1305400	1307960	Isn't that a terribly addictive show?
1307960	1311520	It's like you feel bad, but it's like you can't.
1311520	1313520	The chocolate chips, Alan.
1313520	1314520	They're chocolate chips.
1314520	1315520	Oh, my God.
1315520	1316520	It's horrible.
1316520	1321800	Well, I watch Hoarders because A, Alan likes to joke about how that's going to be us in
1321800	1322800	like 20 years.
1322800	1327080	But B, like it actually makes me feel better about myself because if you'd asked me before
1327080	1330480	I'd watch that show, like Rob, are you a hoarder, I probably would have said, yeah, I'm a little
1330480	1331480	bit of a hoarder.
1331480	1333960	But after watching that show, I'm like, no, no, absolutely not.
1333960	1334960	Oh, hell no.
1334960	1337080	I'd never let it get that bad.
1337080	1338080	Yeah.
1338080	1339080	It's pretty bad on that show.
1339080	1340080	I don't know.
1340080	1346440	You're just getting a little, I'm going to say I've known you for a while, you know.
1346440	1349920	Some of the things on that show are really, I would never let an animal die under all
1349920	1350920	the stuff.
1350920	1351920	That you know of.
1351920	1352920	I know.
1352920	1353920	Yeah.
1353920	1354920	All right.
1354920	1355920	Anyhow.
1355920	1356920	This is why Rob doesn't have a kitty.
1356920	1357920	Yeah.
1357920	1358920	Or Zach and Kelly.
1358920	1359920	Remember them?
1359920	1360920	That was different.
1360920	1362360	That was different, huh?
1362360	1366640	They had, they didn't die under the weight of crap around the house or anything.
1366640	1369920	They actually had their own little tank that they could swim around in.
1369920	1371000	It's not my fault.
1371000	1373600	One of them decided to swim right up the filter and die.
1373600	1375160	And what happened to the other one?
1375160	1377160	I flushed it down the toilet.
1377160	1378160	I don't remember.
1378160	1379160	Was it alive when you did?
1379160	1380160	No.
1380160	1381160	No.
1381160	1382160	The other one died of sadness.
1382160	1385560	I didn't feed him for a week and he was so sad.
1385560	1386560	He died.
1386560	1390960	Well, I mean, if your little fish friend just decided to seppuku up the filter when you're
1390960	1391960	just...
1391960	1392960	I don't think he's seppuku'd.
1392960	1394520	I think you bought the wrong one.
1394520	1395520	You murderer!
1395520	1399240	I bought the tank at Walmart.
1399240	1400360	That was a death wish right there.
1400360	1402000	We can't talk about this anymore.
1402000	1404000	I'm getting so sad.
1404000	1405000	Good.
1405000	1407240	I'm detecting trauma in this room.
1407240	1408240	Uh oh.
1408240	1409240	So housekeeping.
1409240	1410240	Hi.
1410240	1414080	If you like our show, you should join our Facebook club at facebook.com slash orange
1414080	1415080	lounge radio.
1415080	1418960	We also have a Twitter because that's all the cool kids do these days is tweet.
1418960	1422040	And we have a Twitter at, not a Twitter fan, the doctor.
1422040	1424040	I see you over there.
1424040	1428240	I said Twitter and you were like, no, I like the, uh, the Futurama spooper was like, here's
1428240	1430800	a twit now.
1430800	1431800	It's true.
1431800	1432800	Twitter.com slash olr.
1432800	1435560	That's where you can go.
1435560	1436560	Anyhow.
1436560	1437560	I do not have any cute shows on this game.
1437560	1441920	How about video game news, actual bonafide video game news, cause the Tokyo game show
1441920	1442920	happened this week.
1442920	1443920	So there's a lot of news out of there.
1443920	1446520	But we're not starting there tonight actually.
1446520	1447520	What a horrible segue.
1447520	1449080	Where are we starting tonight, Loki?
1449080	1454000	Ah, yes, we're starting with, this is funny cause I could have been affected by this,
1454000	1458440	but thanks to procrastination, uh, I was not.
1458440	1463720	The MMO APB, or what I like to call it, Grand Theft Auto the MMO.
1463720	1468720	More like Saintsboro the MMO, but you know, whatever.
1468720	1474240	It was a cops and robbers MMO game developed by Realtime Worlds who did the wonderful game
1474240	1483040	Crackdown and it launched in the US on June 29th and basically had players playing both
1483040	1490280	the enforcers and criminals and you know, you'd go around creating crime or stopping
1490280	1496760	crime and leveled up and so on and it was one of the big features about it was the wonderful
1496760	1497760	character editor.
1497760	1501880	I mean you could literally create all sorts of stuff with it.
1501880	1510440	But unfortunately, I guess it didn't do too well cause it's closed down already.
1510440	1518040	Realtime Worlds faced massive layoffs last month and I guess before going into administration,
1518040	1523720	which is I guess the UK equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy.
1523720	1532800	So yeah, they weren't doing too well and the quote on the official website is, APB had
1532800	1537200	a fantastic journey but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end.
1537200	1540920	Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service
1540920	1542840	running, APB is coming to a close.
1542840	1547280	It has been a pleasure working on APB and with all of its players together we will be
1547280	1552080	building an absolutely amazing game, or we were building an absolutely amazing game and
1552080	1553360	for that we thank you.
1553360	1554480	You guys are awesome.
1554480	1558360	And the thousands of you that paid for this game just got F'd in the A, right?
1558360	1559360	Uh, yeah.
1559360	1561000	I'm not hearing a lot about the backlash.
1561000	1567000	I mean, is it just because literally no one bought this game or, I mean, it seems so strange
1567000	1569800	to me that an MMO could just get away with shutting down after three months.
1569800	1571640	It wasn't if you're really an MMO.
1571640	1576320	I mean, it's barely an MMO, especially by today's standards for multiplayer games.
1576320	1581680	I mean, it was a hundred player instances basically that you got to play in.
1581680	1583720	Can you play it offline though?
1583720	1584720	No.
1584720	1589780	Well, so if you dropped 60 bucks on this game just three months ago, you paid $20 a month
1589780	1592000	and then some for bleh.
1592000	1593000	Yeah.
1593000	1596760	That stinks.
1596760	1599480	I kind of like tabula rasa member.
1599480	1601880	Well tabula rasa lasted at least a good year.
1601880	1602880	Yeah.
1602880	1607320	I mean three months is, and it's, that's sad.
1607320	1608800	I'd rather get a hooker.
1608800	1609800	Exactly.
1609800	1611680	Think of all the things you could have bought for that 60 bucks.
1611680	1612680	I don't know.
1612680	1613680	I guess it's just kind of sad.
1613680	1616840	Remember APB last for three months, but an STD lasts forever.
1616840	1617840	Exactly.
1617840	1621440	Do we have any listeners in the chat room who actually bought APB and are kind of pissed
1621440	1622440	about this closure?
1622440	1625520	I mean, I don't know if any of our listeners are the type that get low key.
1625520	1630440	You, you talked about this game an awful lot before it came out and then you, you didn't.
1630440	1632120	I mean, did you even get into it?
1632120	1635360	I was in the beta, so I played it for a little bit.
1635360	1636360	It was okay.
1636360	1639040	It's just, it was one of those things I didn't want to buy it cause I didn't think I had
1639040	1643520	time to play it and if I had, I definitely wouldn't have had time to play it.
1643520	1646400	So that's why I didn't buy it.
1646400	1649560	It was fun to check it out.
1649560	1654240	It's too bad because I think it would have worked better as a console game, you know,
1654240	1658420	with an actual, it's just like something that should have been like a, as a Saints Row type
1658420	1660040	of thing or something like that.
1660040	1664360	You know, have the actual main storyline and everything and have like some really fleshed
1664360	1668800	out online mode where you can play, you know, either the cops or the enforcers and level
1668800	1673320	up and have a really cool, you know, character editor and stuff like that.
1673320	1676560	That's what I could have saw this being, but it wasn't.
1676560	1682960	However, all may not be lost cause apparently Epic Games is interesting, or is interested
1682960	1686120	in buying the rights to the game.
1686120	1690480	So maybe we'll see, you know, APB come back in some other form.
1690480	1693400	It'd be interesting.
1693400	1700480	I guess Eurogamer was reporting this saying that, according to the BBC, source close to
1700480	1706800	the development team, a few companies are showing interest in picking up APB's rights
1706800	1712540	and apparently one of those companies is Epic Games, of course the company behind the Gears
1712540	1715120	of War and Unreal Tournament series.
1715120	1719200	And also adding to the speculation, Eurogamer, they were saying citing Dundee development
1719200	1727160	source in real time, I guess was based in Dundee, Scotland, that Dave Jones, the real
1727160	1734720	time world's boss, and Epic were, is quite the talking, or is quite the talking point
1734720	1735720	in the town.
1735720	1739960	He says he and Mr. Rain are good chums and have worked together on many levels for years
1739960	1745200	and years and years, and he's not gonna raise much money and staff here in the near future,
1745200	1750160	so it's sounding like that maybe Epic will buy them.
1750160	1755560	I guess that's good, but still, I mean what type of precedence is this set for the future?
1755560	1761400	Like I'm still just picturing, you know, thousands, well at least hundreds of angry gamers that
1761400	1767600	bought this game, tens of angry gamers that bought this game that feel really screwed
1767600	1773120	about it closing, you know what I mean?
1773120	1777000	Okay this is the first time that's ever happened on The Sims that the shirt just disappears.
1777000	1781720	Dark Soccer doesn't prefer to actually listen to the show when it's going on.
1781720	1785680	She plays The Sims while the show's going on, and we all look over there, like at the
1785680	1788840	same time, don't know why, we just all kind of look over at her computer, she's dressing
1788840	1792400	some character right now, and it's a female character she's dressing, and we look over
1792400	1799160	there, and no top, no top on, just titties hanging out, what kind of game are you playing
1799160	1800160	over there?
1800160	1804340	Oh no, I tried to change her shirt and all of a sudden her boobs just pop out.
1804340	1807920	That's what happens.
1807920	1811320	Question in our chatroom at chat.orangeslaundry.com, or more of a statement from our buddy Segg,
1811320	1816980	I haven't seen him in chat in forever, hi Segg, watch it become like Uru missed online
1816980	1818560	and never die.
1818560	1822020	Missed online got resurrected about three or four times.
1822020	1823020	That's true.
1823020	1826880	It would be neat, it was alright, but once again, you know, doing 100 player instances
1826880	1834640	is not really an MMO, I mean, look at MAG, I mean, that's, I think, what, got 128 players
1834640	1835760	at a time?
1835760	1840560	And they all call it an MMO, they call it like an MMO, an action game I guess, or something
1840560	1841560	like that.
1841560	1845880	I think this is all an elaborate scheme to justify the online pass, because the people
1845880	1848800	who made this game didn't charge for the online pass, did they?
1848800	1853400	And so they're gonna say, because we weren't charging the $10 premium, we had to shut down
1853400	1854400	the servers.
1854400	1856360	But that doesn't make any sense, why would they charge for an online pass if they're
1856360	1858080	charging for online anyways?
1858080	1860920	Oh, I'm sorry, you have to, they don't have a used market for PC titles.
1860920	1862920	Well why not, what's stopping them these days?
1862920	1866400	I'm sorry, you gotta pay, you gotta pay another $10 for online access.
1866400	1869280	I can't play without online access.
1869280	1870280	That's too bad.
1870280	1875840	You know, every time we play these games, especially the online ones, we have to accept
1875840	1880840	like a, you know, terms of conditions, a user agreement basically, right?
1880840	1885680	When are we gonna make the company sign the company agreement when we buy their games?
1885680	1890000	You know, if I plop 60 bucks on this game, you need to keep the damn servers up for at
1890000	1893440	least a year, or you know, XYZ.
1893440	1899000	Unrealistic, yes, but this, I don't know, I just think this is a bad precedence if this
1899000	1904060	just kind of slips away and people are just like, oh well, it was a crappy game anyway.
1904060	1906400	You know, oh well.
1906400	1909100	I think they should get their money back, or people that bought it should get their
1909100	1915560	money back, but unfortunately the company has no money to give back, so, oh well, too
1915560	1916560	bad.
1916560	1917560	You do.
1917560	1918560	Live and learn.
1918560	1921760	Maybe if you have one of those like best buy replacement plans, you can go take the game
1921760	1927560	back, say hey don't work no more, I don't know, good luck, we'll see if that works.
1927560	1930980	Something that might have worked a little better had it come out would have been this
1930980	1933200	patent that was discovered by Sony last week.
1933200	1937240	It was a last gen console adapter.
1937240	1942920	Could explain why there was never PS2 backwards compatibility after of course the very, very
1942920	1945180	first PlayStation 3 console.
1945180	1948320	It was removed from the console pretty quickly to help cut down on cost.
1948320	1952240	Then there were rumors that it was going to come out on the download service, the PlayStation
1952240	1955720	network, we would see PlayStation 2 games, but that never seemed to happen either.
1955720	1961320	Well, apparently one of the tech sites over in Japan, Gigazine, discovered a patent that
1961320	1967720	was filed by Sony Japan back in February of 09, which described an adapter, and it would
1967720	1972760	serve as a bridge for older gen games to be played on a current gen console, and honestly
1972760	1978160	when I look at the picture it looks like you are attaching a PlayStation 2 to your PlayStation
1978160	1979160	3.
1979160	1982240	That is retarded.
1982240	1983240	Is it bad?
1983240	1984240	I still kind of want one.
1984240	1985240	Gigazine.
1985240	1986240	No, no, no, here's what they would do too.
1986240	1988760	They would charge like $150 for that, you know.
1988760	1990760	Even though the PS2 is $100.
1990760	1991760	Exactly.
1991760	1992760	Because they don't learn.
1992760	1996280	It's just like, you know, oh hey, we're going to release this system, we're going to call
1996280	2002600	it the PSP Go, and yeah, we know that the regular PSP is out right now for like $150
2002600	2006640	and that it can play UMD discs, but this new PSP that we're releasing, it's not going to
2006640	2007640	be able to play UMD discs.
2007640	2011160	You're going to have to download all your titles, oh, and we're going to charge $200
2011160	2012160	for it.
2012160	2014160	Oh, I'm sorry, no, $250 for it.
2014160	2015160	Smart.
2015160	2017160	Now something to keep in mind, just to be technical.
2017160	2018160	Oh, and a PS3.
2018160	2019160	That's only $299.
2019160	2023880	Pat doesn't specifically say it's for PlayStation 2 games.
2023880	2029400	It's just for older games, but if you think about it, okay, PlayStation 3 already plays
2029400	2031520	PlayStation 1 games, hmm, I wonder why this is left.
2031520	2034240	No, no, no, you need this additional adapter to play PlayStation 2.
2034240	2040040	No, it's going to play Dreamcast games and Sega CD games.
2040040	2042360	It plays HD DVD, who knew?
2042360	2044040	Wow, that's backwards compatible.
2044040	2048880	All right, so, yeah, it doesn't sound like this would be too incredibly popular if it
2048880	2049880	came out.
2049880	2050880	I don't know.
2050880	2053120	If it was the right price, I'd probably buy it.
2053120	2054120	You know why?
2054120	2056600	To save on the shelf space.
2056600	2057600	Because I don't...
2057600	2060120	How do you figure?
2060120	2064960	Because if I have to get a PlayStation 2 out to hook up, that's a whole nother AC adapter,
2064960	2067840	that's a whole nother set of RGB cords, that's a whole nother...
2067840	2070040	Girlfriend, you just lazy.
2070040	2071040	You lazy.
2071040	2072040	Yeah, pretty much.
2072040	2073040	Pretty much.
2073040	2074040	Actually, you're wrong.
2074040	2075120	It's not another set of RGB cords.
2075120	2078000	It's actually the exact same set.
2078000	2080280	But you have to move it from the PS3 to PS2.
2080280	2081280	You know what?
2081280	2082280	They probably just spray painted a PS2.
2082280	2083280	Well, that's definitely worth $150.
2083280	2084280	It is.
2084280	2088040	They're just like, oh, let's change this to an off gray.
2088040	2097720	Or you can spend, I don't know, $10 and get one of those stupid console switching devices.
2097720	2102280	What if this little bridge actually made the games better, too?
2102280	2103280	Like I don't...
2103280	2106560	Obviously, you can't change the games themselves.
2106560	2108160	Let's play Big Rigs now.
2108160	2112760	Keep in mind, Rob, Mythbusters did prove that you can polish a turd.
2112760	2113760	But it...
2113760	2114760	Ew.
2114760	2123680	This screeching hall was brought to you by Dark Sakura and her lovely insights.
2123680	2126920	What if it like, up-res the resolution of the game, and...
2126920	2128880	Yeah, that'd be so amazing.
2128880	2130880	If only a console did that already.
2130880	2133360	Oh, yeah, the PlayStation 3 does.
2133360	2134360	That's so crazy.
2134360	2136240	But not for PS2 games.
2136240	2139000	It did if you got one of the launch systems.
2139000	2142000	Well, too bad not a lot of people bought one of the launch systems.
2142000	2144000	Well, you should have done that.
2144000	2145000	Lower your standards.
2145000	2148000	Don't give me $700 or whatever the hell those things cost back then.
2148000	2149000	They were crazy.
2149000	2150000	$599 US dollars.
2150000	2151000	Well...
2151000	2152000	I don't know.
2152000	2153000	Alright, I'm over it.
2153000	2154000	You guys are mean.
2154000	2155000	It's stupid that you know it, Rob.
2155000	2156000	Everybody's picking on me.
2156000	2161720	The best part about that, though, is I have one of those systems that plays PlayStation
2161720	2165160	2 games, and I don't play any PlayStation 2 games in it at all.
2165160	2171360	I would play Final Fantasy XII,.hack, because I never did beat it, and Magic Pen Gel.
2171360	2173600	But don't you have a PS2 already?
2173600	2176240	In a box somewhere.
2176240	2179400	We've used ours to play PS2 games.
2179400	2181360	I don't want to actually look for my PS2.
2181360	2184520	I'm gonna go buy this thing for my PS3.
2184520	2185520	You don't understand.
2185520	2186520	No, I don't.
2186520	2190440	A, there's no guarantee the PS2 still works.
2190440	2194800	B, it's a whole other set of cords that you have to hook into the back of the TV.
2194800	2196600	God, you must be the laziest person.
2196600	2199840	There's no guarantee that it works, so I'm not even gonna try.
2199840	2203720	I'm just gonna drop this hundred-whatever-the-fuck dollars on this thing.
2203720	2208600	You were here the other week, when we had the 32X hooked up, and that's a whole bunch
2208600	2209600	of cables.
2209600	2211720	Yeah, but you guys are a special kind of crazy.
2211720	2212720	You know what?
2212720	2216440	We're the kind of crazy that likes to not be lazy.
2216440	2218800	How many inputs are on the back of your TV?
2218800	2221760	I mean, seriously, you don't even need to hook up anything.
2221760	2226280	You just plug them in to begin with, and oh, it's hooked up at the same time.
2226280	2229920	I hit input on my remote, and wow!
2229920	2233320	The power of PlayStation 2, brought to my TV!
2233320	2239000	I think that my TV has something like three HDMI things, and then a bunch of AV, and like
2239000	2245080	some S-video, and like the little one that you use the Switch for.
2245080	2246080	Well that's nice.
2246080	2248680	My TV's from Costco, so I don't think it probably has.
2248680	2250760	Our TV is from Costco.
2250760	2252340	That is not a valid excuse.
2252340	2254640	I've rendered your excuse invalid.
2254640	2257400	I swear my thing only has like two inputs, and an HDMI.
2257400	2258400	Well yours sucks.
2258400	2259400	You should return it.
2259400	2264720	I'm sorry that your thing only has two inputs, that's why.
2264720	2265720	Next story!
2265720	2266720	Next topic.
2266720	2271280	Well, how about, um, some more PS3 news.
2271280	2273640	There is going to be a new system update 3.42.
2273640	2278080	Why can't they just give them regular numbers instead of points, you know?
2278080	2280440	Why can't it be update number four?
2280440	2281440	Update number five?
2281440	2282440	No.
2282440	2284120	Because right now they'd be at update number 62.
2284120	2285120	They're bitches.
2285120	2290840	Because the whole number updates are for major, major, major updates, and this is just, hey,
2290840	2292800	we're adding Blu-ray, or, you know.
2292800	2297720	Well, the next one is 3.5, because we just got 3.42.
2297720	2305320	And this one is going to add 3D Blu-ray movie support, since it can already do 3D with games.
2305320	2315320	And that date is actually out for the Japanese market on September 21st, but I guess it's
2315320	2317320	going to be after?
2317320	2321840	And you'll be able to watch tens of movies with that.
2321840	2326000	Or like, literally I think there's less than 20 movies out there that have 3D Blu-ray.
2326000	2327800	Can I just say, fuck 3D.
2327800	2330800	Like, I'm so over it.
2330800	2336520	We actually have one of those 3D TVs and 3D Blu-rays at our work, because our Sony rep
2336520	2341320	came in and we had this really nice Samsung TV up on the wall, and he's like, that's not
2341320	2342320	a Sony TV.
2342320	2343320	I'm getting you a Sony TV.
2343320	2345320	And it's going to be a 3D TV.
2345320	2346960	Tell your Sony rep to get me a TV.
2346960	2348120	Do you watch Avatar?
2348120	2350180	No, well, we can't.
2350180	2351180	That's not 3D Blu-ray.
2351180	2353040	Like, seriously, the only 3D-
2353040	2357400	Because that will be in the super extended Uber James Cameron's cock Blu-ray edition.
2357400	2361840	Well, okay, well, until then, though, all we have is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
2361840	2365180	That's like seriously the only damn movie that's in 3D.
2365180	2369600	Which is also James Cameron's cock.
2369600	2370600	Just by the way, don't-
2370600	2371600	His meaty balls.
2371600	2374400	Cloudy with a Chance of Balls.
2374400	2375800	Cameron balls.
2375800	2381880	Don't watch Resident Evil Afterlife, and especially don't watch it in 3D.
2381880	2382880	It was awesome.
2382880	2383880	Why didn't you like that?
2383880	2384880	I want to see it.
2384880	2385880	You're kidding, right?
2385880	2387020	No, I liked it.
2387020	2388020	You're being facetious.
2388020	2389020	Tell me you're being facetious.
2389020	2390020	Tell me.
2390020	2391020	My head's gonna explode.
2391020	2392020	No.
2392020	2395960	But, no, that would be one of the only movies that I would actually want to go see in 3D,
2395960	2396960	because you know it's gonna be ridiculous.
2396960	2397960	You know?
2397960	2398960	Okay, did you go see it in 3D?
2398960	2400840	It's just like going to an amusement park.
2400840	2401840	Okay.
2401840	2402840	What did you not like about it?
2402840	2407200	Well, okay, the movie itself was fucking ridiculous and stupid.
2407200	2410280	The 3D was obviously the added on 3D.
2410280	2411280	It wasn't shot in 3D.
2411280	2412280	It was shot in 3D.
2412280	2413280	It was?
2413280	2414280	Yeah.
2414280	2416920	They actually, even when they were writing the script, they were writing with 3D in mind.
2416920	2420000	When they were writing the script of Dawn of the Dead.
2420000	2421960	They used the same cameras as Avatar did.
2421960	2422960	It was this big deal.
2422960	2423960	Wow.
2423960	2424960	No, but, okay.
2424960	2425960	That's cool.
2425960	2430900	We actually, we went and saw that, I went and saw that actually on, uh, last week, um,
2430900	2431900	with the D-Box seats.
2431900	2433240	I don't know if you've heard about those.
2433240	2435780	The motion seats that actually move and rumble and stuff.
2435780	2436780	It was cool.
2436780	2437780	Okay.
2437780	2438780	Well, that might have added to it.
2438780	2439780	And here's the thing, though.
2439780	2443880	I don't really play the Resident Evil games, so for me, this movie is kind of like, hey,
2443880	2445900	look, it's almost like The Matrix, but not, you know?
2445900	2450000	So I don't know if the storyline ruined it for you, because I could, I couldn't care,
2450000	2451000	you know?
2451000	2452000	Yes.
2452000	2453000	The storyline was stupid.
2453000	2457600	And, okay, the extent of the 3D stuff was just, oh, look at this blood flying in your
2457600	2458600	face.
2458600	2459600	Oh, look at this building.
2459600	2462420	It's crumbling, and some of the crumbles are falling in your face.
2462420	2464440	There was nothing, like, exciting about it.
2464440	2467960	Maybe I'm just an old crotchety woman that doesn't like 3D, which is entirely possible.
2467960	2471360	There was a lot of gimmicky stuff in there, like, a lot of, like, throwing stuff at the
2471360	2472360	camera.
2472360	2474600	Hey, I'm throwing my glasses at the camera.
2474600	2479360	No, but that's, like, one of the only movies that I would go, okay, that's in 3D.
2479360	2480360	That makes sense.
2480360	2481360	But, like, Eat, Pray, Love.
2481360	2483800	I mean, that doesn't need to be in 3D.
2483800	2484800	Was that really in 3D?
2484800	2488600	I'm gonna pray.
2488600	2491840	And I was extending my folded hands forward.
2491840	2494720	No, and just the movie itself was really stupid.
2494720	2499560	Like, literally, it was Dawn of the Dead, except with, like, Resident Evil people.
2499560	2500560	Oh, geez, spoilers.
2500560	2501560	Oh, my God.
2501560	2502560	You've seen it before.
2502560	2507320	Didn't we go through this whole 3D craze back in the 80s, with, like, Jaws 3D?
2507320	2508960	I don't know.
2508960	2510440	I was, like, five.
2510440	2517960	Well, I think, okay, right now, Sony, they were kind of bad for doing it.
2517960	2521000	Before with, like, the PlayStation 3, when it first came out, it was, like, $600, and
2521000	2522880	they're like, well, that's because that's Blu-ray in it.
2522880	2526080	Well, everyone complained, I don't give a fuck, it's $600.
2526080	2527680	I'm not buying it.
2527680	2531320	It's because they're kind of jumping, they're trying to push the technology too much.
2531320	2536680	Just like 3D TV, I'm glad you're supporting 3D with your games, and I'm glad you're supporting
2536680	2540760	3D Blu-ray, because probably you have a little bit of an investment in it since, I don't
2540760	2548000	know, you have a lot of Blu-ray stuff, you are your own movie company and whatnot.
2548000	2552440	So obviously, they're trying to invest some of that in there, but it's really not viable
2552440	2559880	now to buy a 3D TV or a 3D Blu-ray player, because there's hardly any content for it.
2559880	2564200	And if you just wait, it's going to get damn cheaper anyways, and there's probably something
2564200	2565200	better going to come out.
2565200	2569280	You know, they're going to come out with TVs that don't require stupid glasses on you.
2569280	2572640	Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
2572640	2576840	Salacious Pop is in chat and follows up the comment about Eat, Pray, Love, and 3D, saying
2576840	2580600	Julia Roberts' mouth in 3D would be a sin of technology.
2580600	2584480	Ah, see, 3D bad.
2584480	2587680	There's this picture I sometimes see on Oh No They Didn't, and somebody needs to link
2587680	2588680	it in chat.
2588680	2590080	I'm like, Alan, find this picture.
2590080	2594720	It's like, it's a picture of Julia Roberts, but it's been photoshopped to really exaggerate
2594720	2596080	her horse mouth.
2596080	2597080	And it's really scary.
2597080	2599200	Like, it makes her look like a zombie.
2599200	2601600	Surety has an exaggerated horse mouth.
2601600	2602600	I don't want to see the picture.
2602600	2603600	It's so scary.
2603600	2604600	No, don't do it, Alan.
2604600	2605600	No.
2605600	2606960	Somebody will find it for me.
2606960	2610040	SSJ100Matt says, Rob's still waiting for Showgirls 3D.
2610040	2611040	True story.
2611040	2612040	Oh my God.
2612040	2613960	Actually, you want to hear a true story?
2613960	2617240	I bought Showgirls on Blu-ray this week for $18.
2617240	2618240	It was on sale.
2618240	2619240	Wow.
2619240	2620240	That's awesome.
2620240	2621240	I want to go watch it.
2621240	2622240	We should have it.
2622240	2623240	I should come over.
2623240	2624240	We should have a Showgirls party.
2624240	2625240	Let's do it.
2625240	2626240	I want to watch the TV version.
2626240	2629240	And we'll have brown rice and vegetables, Rob.
2629240	2632680	We'll have a whole little Showgirls party.
2632680	2633680	It'll be fun.
2633680	2634680	Yay.
2634680	2635680	Ah.
2635680	2639200	That is seriously a movie that needs to be in 3D, though.
2639200	2640200	And...
2640200	2641200	Eat, Pray, Love.
2641200	2643200	No, not Eat, Pray, Love.
2643200	2644200	Showgirls.
2644200	2645200	Well, actually, not even.
2645200	2646200	Yeah, yeah.
2646200	2647200	Showgirls.
2647200	2648200	No one wants to see that movie.
2648200	2650320	I want Saved by the Bell 3D, then.
2650320	2654840	No, because they had, was it the Piranha 3D or whatever, and they had a whole bunch of
2654840	2658360	like, oh, it's a wet t-shirt contest, you know, type of stuff.
2658360	2660000	So we need more of that with less of the piranhas.
2660000	2664280	I mean, the piranhas are cool and all, but I mean, you don't need to mix them both together.
2664280	2665280	Yeah.
2665280	2667880	Like, Nomi's nipples are going to be coming out into your face.
2667880	2672100	But can you imagine, you know, the really weird thrash sex she was doing?
2672100	2673340	You know that in 3D?
2673340	2674340	That'd be some scary stuff.
2674340	2675480	That would be scary.
2675480	2676480	People would be like, ah.
2676480	2677480	What the fuck is that?
2677480	2678480	You gonna die?
2678480	2679480	Watch.
2679480	2682480	I know what's happening in this movie.
2682480	2683480	You gonna die.
2683480	2684480	Ah.
2684480	2685480	Rob, close it now.
2685480	2686480	I hate it.
2686480	2687480	Ah.
2687480	2688480	Ah.
2688480	2689480	Ah.
2689480	2690480	Times a million.
2690480	2691480	No.
2691480	2692480	I found the picture I was looking for.
2692480	2693480	Or one of them.
2693480	2694480	Oh, my God.
2694480	2695480	Hold on.
2695480	2696480	This is terrible radio.
2696480	2697960	Let me leave this nerd shack.
2697960	2699240	What is going on?
2699240	2702600	I don't know, but I lost the don't shit my pants game.
2702600	2705480	Why is that like, Enzite guy there?
2705480	2706480	No.
2706480	2707480	Okay.
2707480	2708480	I just.
2708480	2709480	Cover it up.
2709480	2710480	Cover it up with that window.
2710480	2711480	Move it, Rob.
2711480	2712480	Don't.
2712480	2713480	Ah.
2713480	2714480	Just Google.
2714480	2715480	Okay.
2715480	2716480	Or not Google.
2716480	2717480	Go to photo bucket.
2717480	2718480	Because they let you search your pictures and search for Julia Roberts.
2718480	2719480	Gif.
2719480	2720480	Gif.
2720480	2721480	Julia Roberts.
2721480	2722480	Gif.
2722480	2723480	And it will come right up.
2723480	2724480	It's like the first image.
2724480	2725480	It's hilarious.
2725480	2726480	Oh, my God.
2726480	2727480	Let's see.
2727480	2728480	Um.
2728480	2733320	Spazinator PSN says, I wouldn't mind seeing Angelina Jolie's boobs in 3D.
2733320	2734840	Just saying.
2734840	2738800	You know, wanted might have been kind of cool in 3D, because they tried to do some 3D ish
2738800	2739800	kind of things in that.
2739800	2741020	I could see that working.
2741020	2746640	You know, with a movie like that, that's just like this movie is like so hetero.
2746640	2748640	It's dick has a dick like type of thing.
2748640	2749640	Yeah.
2749640	2750640	That's weird.
2750640	2751640	That's not very hetero right there.
2751640	2753240	I would not fuck a dick that had a dick.
2753240	2755240	That would be awkward.
2755240	2760440	Yeah, I'm like, I gotta go now away from your dick.
2760440	2761860	You know what I mean, though?
2761860	2762860	I guess.
2762860	2767320	That would be weird if, like, the bullets went around your face in 3D.
2767320	2769720	I almost got shot.
2769720	2771240	Yeah.
2771240	2772240	You know what I'm going to do?
2772240	2777760	I'm going to post that Julia Roberts gift to our Twitter and just see what we're past.
2777760	2781160	I'm going to see who's not listening to the show right now by seeing the responses we
2781160	2782160	get.
2782160	2783160	Okay.
2783160	2787120	And in the meantime, did it work that at that?
2787120	2793120	So, back to the Doctor and the Princess Show.
2793120	2799120	Well, now that we're done with that topic, let's talk about Halo Reach and its shortcomings.
2799120	2803960	Halo Reach is an awesome game, but somebody didn't test it well enough, and that somebody
2803960	2810000	would be Microsoft, because Halo Reach has problems playing on the brand new 4GB Xbox
2810000	2813000	360 slimmer system.
2813000	2818760	It's funny, because apparently co-op requires a hard drive in order to work, which is dumb
2818760	2821120	to begin with.
2821120	2828000	The 4GB of storage that's on those new systems is kind of classified as a memory unit.
2828000	2832880	So therefore, despite the fact that you have adequate space to store whatever files they
2832880	2838080	want you to store, it still won't let you play co-op.
2838080	2840460	And same with USB memory sticks.
2840460	2841600	Those also don't count.
2841600	2846000	Those are still thumb drives or memory sticks or whatever.
2846000	2847040	That's not a hard drive.
2847040	2848040	Not close enough.
2848040	2853680	So you're still going to have to play solo or play online.
2853680	2855400	You have to play with yourself.
2855400	2859480	Apparently though, Microsoft has said that they're aware of the issue, and this is going
2859480	2860560	to be a temporary issue.
2860560	2862720	The company is working to resolve it.
2862720	2864720	But seriously, come on, man.
2864720	2866920	That should have been something that you should have tested first.
2866920	2871040	Let's try playing this on each of our SKUs, especially the ones that have just come out,
2871040	2874440	and let's see if it works correctly.
2874440	2880520	On one of the biggest games for our company, that might be important to do.
2880520	2882520	Just a little bit.
2882520	2888200	Or maybe they're just trying to upsell those bigger console bundles.
2888200	2893160	Let me buy your stupid 4GB system and then I have to buy your really expensive hard drive
2893160	2898900	to plug into it because normal hard drives won't work, despite the fact that it's a normal
2898900	2902960	hard drive, but formatted differently.
2902960	2903960	Fun.
2903960	2904960	Totally.
2904960	2911640	Why can't you just allow anybody to put their own hard drives in there?
2911640	2912640	Just like Sony.
2912640	2917400	At least they have that going for them.
2917400	2921520	Alright well I'm going to move on to another story here about a website called Good Old
2921520	2926080	Games and a lot of interesting developments that's going on today.
2926080	2928960	After hearing about the developments I kind of hesitate even bringing up this story on
2928960	2932960	the show in the first place, but it's kind of bold what's going on.
2932960	2937880	Well Good Old Games is a website located at GOG.com and we brought them up on the show
2937880	2938880	before.
2938880	2944280	It's a website where you can buy old games like the King's Quest series and just like
2944280	2950480	old PC games from back in the day for like 5 bucks or 10 bucks and it's all DRM free.
2950480	2953620	Like Fallout 2, just older PC games.
2953620	2956480	So it's kind of like legalized abandonware basically.
2956480	2958640	For companies that still want to sell their old games.
2958640	2964320	Well they shut down today and posted a notice on their website that says, we recently had
2964320	2968540	to give serious thought as to whether we could really keep GOG.com going the way it is.
2968540	2972380	We've debated on it for quite some time and unfortunately we've decided that GOG.com simply
2972380	2973800	cannot remain in its current form.
2973800	2979440	So the website, a lot of news sites kind of post about this, oh this is such a good idea,
2979440	2984000	made this thing legal and you know it was good karma to buy the games and stuff and
2984000	2985000	now they've shut down.
2985000	2987080	Oh it's a bummer to see them go.
2987080	2993880	But now it's coming out today, did they really shut down or is this all a marketing ploy?
2993880	2998360	And that is apparently the latest news that is coming out is that this is actually a marketing
2998360	3006240	ploy about their change from the beta version of GOG.com to the full version of GOG.com.
3006240	3012560	And in an article that Kotaku ran, they actually got an update from spokesman Tom Ohle, O-H-L-E,
3012560	3013560	Ohle?
3013560	3014560	Ohle?
3014560	3019560	Well he's kind of an a-hole if this whole thing turns out to be true, saying quote,
3019560	3024520	as the message on the site says, this doesn't mean that GOG is gone, we'll have more to
3024520	3026160	share in the coming days.
3026160	3030240	It's kind of bootsy, I don't like that.
3030240	3034580	It's just, here's the thing, and I even commented this on my Twitter when this whole thing was
3034580	3038920	going on, it was like, you know, more people are talking about GOG.com today than they
3038920	3042440	probably ever did during its run, and it's kind of one of those, well you know they had
3042440	3045760	a good idea, but if they weren't really selling the games, how are they going to really stay
3045760	3046760	in business?
3046760	3050320	You know it's kind of a bummer that people decided to start carrying today.
3050320	3053800	Well what's interesting is that now the whole thing might have actually been a media hoax.
3053800	3058280	So on one hand you got to kind of go, lol, that's funny, good job, you got the press.
3058280	3062280	But on the other hand, to your loyal customers who are kind of freaking out about, are the
3062280	3065840	games I bought still going to work, how am I going to re-download these games, you know
3065840	3069840	your core fan base is going to feel a little bit used after something like this.
3069840	3073480	So it's like, yes you get the exposure, but at what cost?
3073480	3075680	I felt very used on Rob's network.
3075680	3077800	Have you ever bought a game on GOG?
3077800	3080720	I didn't think so.
3080720	3088040	Yeah, Spassinator PSN in our chat room says, good ol' games, bad ol' decisions.
3088040	3093120	That could be accurate.
3093120	3094120	You alright?
3094120	3095120	Yes!
3095120	3096120	Nothing happened at all.
3096120	3097120	Yes, we're good over here.
3097120	3098120	Good, good to hear it.
3098120	3100120	The core definitely didn't fall out of the microphone.
3100120	3102120	Nope, nope, it stayed intact.
3102120	3103120	Wow.
3103120	3104960	Loki, what do you think?
3104960	3108400	I know you probably weren't a big advocate of this site in the first place, but what
3108400	3110200	do you think about this as a marketing trick?
3110200	3112880	As a marketing trick?
3112880	3115840	That's cool that we're all talking about you, and then when you come back you're like,
3115840	3119600	ah, no, we're not really going away, everyone's like, okay, no, we're not talking about you
3119600	3121840	anymore, no one cares.
3121840	3126320	I think it's, in terms of marketing, because keep in mind there is no such thing as bad
3126320	3130280	press really, it gets people talking.
3130280	3135760	Here's my suggestion, and I know there's a handful of sites out there that listen to
3135760	3140760	our show, for inspiration I'm sure, not to trash us on their blog every week, but here's
3140760	3146080	the thing, if you cover the story about them shutting down, and you want to really get
3146080	3150100	revenge on these guys and their little marketing tricks, and how they're using you basically
3150100	3154760	to get free advertising for their site, cover the story about them shutting down, and don't
3154760	3157120	cover the story about them reopening.
3157120	3162960	And then punch them in the dick, and the guy will be like, ole, my dick.
3162960	3164760	If you want.
3164760	3170280	But no, seriously, because if nobody covers the story about them reopening.
3170280	3174680	Then this little marketing thing kind of bit them in the ass, didn't it?
3174680	3176280	Food for thought.
3176280	3181640	I know if I ran a website such as the aforementioned Kotaku or Joystiq, I just wouldn't run, I
3181640	3188360	would say, you know, I'm not your little press release releasing bitch, so I'm not writing
3188360	3191620	the story about you guys reopening or launching the new site.
3191620	3193760	Good luck getting the press on that one.
3193760	3194760	P.S.
3194760	3196040	You suck.
3196040	3201760	And some quotes in our chat room, MXT says GOG has died, SEG says GOG had jumped the
3201760	3204520	shark, and Spazinator says more like fuck the shark.
3204520	3209800	I'm actually not sure exactly how one fucks the shark as opposed to jumping over it.
3209800	3212480	It's like, aye, aye.
3212480	3213640	Wow, Rob.
3213640	3215880	Bend over, shark.
3215880	3217840	That doesn't show your age.
3217840	3221000	Dark Sakura, please, won't you help us change the subject?
3221000	3223080	There are other subjects, definitely.
3223080	3228480	It was spoken, actually, it came up on Twitter.
3228480	3235480	Katsuhiro Harada, who is the Tekken director guy, he posted on Twitter, TGS September 18th
3235480	3243000	at Togeki booth, I'll announce something, colon D. Smile face.
3243000	3246200	And we actually don't know what it is yet.
3246200	3249880	It's Tekken Tag Tournament 2.
3249880	3253240	Sorry.
3253240	3255840	Yeah.
3255840	3257720	Are you not excited about Tekken Tag Tournament 2?
3257720	3260120	I wasn't excited about the first Tekken Tag Tournament.
3260120	3263400	No, I think that's what it ended up being, yeah, he's right.
3263400	3266800	You know I still have to play it, because it's Tekken.
3266800	3267800	Sorry.
3267800	3272960	Well, I mean, wasn't there like, in the 3D Street Fighter series, didn't you like, not
3272960	3275160	like the first game but the second one was okay?
3275160	3276160	Things like that?
3276160	3277160	In the EX ones?
3277160	3278160	Yeah.
3278160	3283320	They're alright, I'm just not a big fan of the Tekken Tag series, I mean, did they make
3283320	3284640	it better than the first one?
3284640	3288400	Whoa, your mic cut out, sorry, I didn't even realize we just had big dead air, sorry about
3288400	3289400	that.
3289400	3290400	LAH!
3290400	3291400	Okay.
3291400	3292400	So Tekken Tag.
3292400	3296400	Tekken Tag, if it's better than the first one, then yeah, I won't be disappointed, but
3296400	3300440	I don't know, the first one was really not all that great, except for Tekken Bowl.
3300440	3304480	Well, here's my thoughts on it, that it's probably just gonna be, since they're developing
3304480	3312160	a tag team tournament, you know, sort of engine for, you know, Tekken X Capcom, you know,
3312160	3316660	the Namco version of that, it'll probably just be based off that, except it's not gonna
3316660	3319200	have any Capcom characters in it.
3319200	3324360	Which, if you ask me, is kind of lame, because, you know, when you play Tekken X Capcom, you're
3324360	3328000	just, you're gonna want to play that game versus, you know, the other one anyways, so.
3328000	3330000	It's sort of like, what's the point?
3330000	3332000	Uh, yeah.
3332000	3333000	It is.
3333000	3342000	And apparently, that game will be hitting Japanese arcades in 2011, and it is an updated,
3342000	3347960	I guess, it is a follow-up, of course, to 1999's arcade original, updated with new roster,
3347960	3353360	and current gen graphics engine, doesn't say that the US version has been announced yet,
3353360	3356400	but they have a nice little teaser trailer that's up right now.
3356400	3358040	Well, you know they're gonna have a US version.
3358040	3361600	Well, I mean, if this is an arcade game, that's kind of good news, I guess.
3361600	3365400	We've had some, a few stories in the past few weeks about good news for arcade games,
3365400	3366400	you know?
3366400	3370040	Like, they're getting some things that the consoles actually don't have just yet, although,
3370040	3373480	it's probably inevitable this comes out for consoles as well, but.
3373480	3379960	Well, I hope it does, but I would really like to see, um, if it did get an arcade release
3379960	3381600	in the US, you know I'd play it.
3381600	3386980	Like I said, I don't think if it does come out console, or if it does come out, uh, yeah,
3386980	3390600	console-wise, it's not gonna take that long to port it over, because, like I said, they're
3390600	3398920	building an engine already for, uh, the, you know, Tekken Cross Capcom game, so, uh, or
3398920	3400320	Street Fighter, I guess.
3400320	3404080	It's, it's gonna be the same damn engine, I know it.
3404080	3407920	SSG-100 Matt in our chatroom says it actually looks like the same system as Tekken Cross
3407920	3408920	Capcom, so.
3408920	3412920	Yeah, and that, see, that's the sad thing, though, is since, you know, they have that
3412920	3417500	game coming out, it's like, uh, you know, I could play that game, but I'd rather play
3417500	3422120	the Capcom one, or the, not the Capcom, the Street Fighter one, because it's got, you
3422120	3425560	know, more variety of characters, you know, and now you have this one.
3425560	3429080	I just hope they don't put it, bring it out in console, just leave it in the arcade or
3429080	3430080	something.
3430080	3432520	But put all the characters, though, in, you know, the Street Fighter one, too, so that'd
3432520	3433520	be kinda cool.
3433520	3436240	Alright, let's travel around the world and talk about some games that are coming out
3436240	3438600	a whole lot sooner than Tekken Tag Tournament.
3438600	3442960	Uh, this week, not a whole lot coming out in the US, uh, it's actually pretty light,
3442960	3444480	but next week it'll be pretty nice.
3444480	3448800	Um, starting off, though, this week we have Swords on the Wii, it is a sword fighting
3448800	3449800	game.
3449800	3454560	Uh, looks like a re-release of a game called Chicken Blaster, with a stupid shotgun with
3454560	3455560	that.
3455560	3456560	Fun.
3456560	3457560	Uh.
3457560	3458560	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3458560	3459840	Is it a chicken fighting game?
3459840	3461440	One more time, please.
3461440	3464800	Chicken Blaster on the Wii, and it comes with a shotgun?
3464800	3467240	Yeah, a little shotgun attachment.
3467240	3468240	Yeah.
3468240	3469240	Okay, okay.
3469240	3472480	It's a really small shotgun, I, I know, I know, oh, okay.
3472480	3476520	The doctor dare says that Wii gaming is dead.
3476520	3477520	How could you?
3477520	3478520	You're wrong, sir.
3478520	3479520	How could you?
3479520	3480520	You are wrong.
3480520	3481520	You just need Chicken Shooter.
3481520	3482520	Chicken Blaster, okay.
3482520	3483520	Chicken Shoot was the first game.
3483520	3484520	Chicken Blaster with your small shotgun.
3484520	3485520	Get it right.
3485520	3490240	Um, Sid Meier's Civilization V coming out on PC.
3490240	3491240	Yay.
3491240	3502440	Uh, new carnival games on the DS and the Wii, uh, yay, um, looks like, what is it, um, World
3502440	3515080	Golf 2011, that's also on PC, um, Patrician, I think that's, Patrician IV on PC, I have
3515080	3520980	no idea what the hell that is, uh, Formula One 2010, coming from, well, what was formerly
3520980	3526560	Codemasters, now Warner Home Video Games, that's on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this
3526560	3532160	week, uh, let's see.
3532160	3536720	Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue on the DS, a tie-in with the new one coming out.
3536720	3537720	Yay.
3537720	3538720	Whoopty shit.
3538720	3539720	Uh.
3539720	3542520	Come on, OLR listeners, how many of you bought Fancy Nancy last week, that's what I want
3542520	3543520	to know.
3543520	3544520	Chirp, chirp.
3544520	3550680	Ah, Sony, once again, not quite getting it, but High Velocity Bowling for Playstation 3.
3550680	3555420	High Velocity Bowling, yes, you may remember this as the Playstation Network title that
3555420	3560760	came out originally at $10, probably now $5, but hey, guess what, you're gonna pay $40
3560760	3561760	for this one now.
3561760	3562760	This one has move support, right?
3562760	3566800	It does have move support, but I think the old one was getting patched for move support,
3566800	3567800	I think.
3567800	3571680	I could be wrong, but, uh, that would be ironic if that was the case.
3571680	3578320	Um, Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allen Poe conspiracy, for the DS.
3578320	3579320	What?
3579320	3580320	Farm Frenzy?
3580320	3583560	You know what, I was about to make the same joke I know I made on this show, like, four
3583560	3587160	weeks ago, so this game had to have gotten pushed back, because I was gonna say, I will
3587160	3589680	buy that game, quote the raven, nevermore.
3589680	3590680	No!
3590680	3594640	I know I made that joke four weeks ago, and you all groaned then, too.
3594640	3595640	I'm leaving.
3595640	3600800	Uh, Farm Frenzy Animal Country, yay, ah, that's for the DS.
3600800	3608320	Club Penguin Game Day for the Wii, um, Gormiti the Lords of Nature, thank you, Konami, for
3608320	3613160	this wonderful game on the DS and the Wii, and I'm being sarcastic, it's not wonderful
3613160	3617080	at all, uh, Jewels of the Tropical Lost Island.
3617080	3619920	God, this game list is shitty as fuck, man.
3619920	3623160	This is the great thing, is that, low-key, like, whenever we do the US release dates,
3623160	3627520	it'll be like, yeah, you know, Halo's coming out this week, and then we have on the DS,
3627520	3634360	Fancy Nancy, and, uh, looks like we've got Jewel Questathon, and Chicken Shoot's coming
3634360	3635360	out on the Wii!
3635360	3639040	No, but that's my point, though, I've been waiting for, like, two years for, like, good
3639040	3642080	games to start coming out on the Wii again, and I'm like, okay, Zelda's coming out next
3642080	3643080	year.
3643080	3646640	You know what, you can come over and play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom with me.
3646640	3648680	That's not, well, that's on the Wii, yeah, I played that.
3648680	3649680	That's a fun game.
3649680	3650680	That's about epic yarn.
3650680	3654240	Well, that's not out yet, see, that's what I mean, that's not out yet, and that looks
3654240	3656800	like a good game, shut up, that does not sound like Fancy Nancy.
3656800	3659520	But before that, Wii Party.
3659520	3665040	Did you see that they actually got the idea for the Kirby game from an old Kirby commercial
3665040	3666800	that Nintendo had made using yarn?
3666800	3670520	There is some decent stuff coming out this week, and we're also going to end with some
3670520	3677520	crappy stuff, um, as if we haven't already, um, was it, uh, Etrian Odyssey 3, the Drowned
3677520	3683160	City on DS, that's a pretty good RPG from, um, Atlus.
3683160	3687800	Final Fantasy XIV, the collector's edition, coming out on PC this week.
3687800	3691520	I think you get that earlier than the regular version, I guess that's special.
3691520	3696280	Wait, and how much, how much are you going to pay for Final Fantasy XIV to play it early?
3696280	3697280	Seventy-five dollars.
3697280	3702280	Good lord, that's a lot of money.
3702280	3712120	Also, uh, also this week, Darksiders, uh, on PC, and, um, and I believe that's it.
3712120	3717000	Alright, uh, before we go to Japan, let's go to the, and their release dates, let's
3717000	3721720	go to, uh, some of the comments in our chatroom at chat.orangeslauncerated.com, um, Spazinator
3721720	3725240	PSN says, wait, wait, wait, did Sky just say chicken shitter?
3725240	3726240	What the fuck?
3726240	3730320	Actually, that game would probably be a whole lot more interesting, um, yeah, chicken shitter.
3730320	3733440	Mark Toagak says, Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club.
3733440	3735300	Can I take a tangent for a minute?
3735300	3740080	Tangent train, absolutely, 100%, has nothing to do with video games whatsoever, but it
3740080	3741440	does have to do with strippers.
3741440	3743440	Okay, yes, you can.
3743440	3747820	So, I went out clubbing last night with Alan and we met, you know, some mutual friends
3747820	3753240	and met up for dinner and went to one of the bars downtown and we were sitting at a bar,
3753240	3758000	a table that is right by the window, so you can look out onto the street and see what's
3758000	3759000	going on.
3759000	3765520	And we watched this, there's a really popular gay bar across the street where all the little
3765520	3770980	like circuit boys and all their little, you know, the women that want to go see the horny
3770980	3771980	guys and stuff.
3771980	3774560	That's, that's the club they all go to that I outgrew many, many, many years ago.
3774560	3775560	I know what you're talking about.
3775560	3776560	Yes.
3776560	3777560	You know exactly which place I'm talking about.
3777560	3779240	Anyone who lives in Sacramento knows what club I'm talking about.
3779240	3784860	So we are sitting at the place across the street looking out the window and we see this
3784860	3792440	gigantic bus pull up in front of it and inside the bus is like all these disco lights and
3792440	3796520	like green neon lights going on and we look carefully in the bus.
3796520	3799360	There's a stripper pole inside the bus.
3799360	3800360	That's awesome.
3800360	3803040	And I'm like, what in the hell is that?
3803040	3806080	And my friend speaks up and I don't remember if it was Alan or my friend says, oh, it's
3806080	3807280	one of those stripper buses.
3807280	3810340	I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3810340	3811340	They have that now?
3811340	3817560	They have traveling, like put on your seatbelt, strap herself to the pole.
3817560	3818560	How does that rock?
3818560	3819560	What?
3819560	3820560	It's not a stripper bus.
3820560	3821560	It's a limo bus.
3821560	3828800	And the reason we, this is funny, uh, we last week, um, we did our game summit thing and
3828800	3833920	we, one of the days we went out, uh, they took us to a few wineries and they did wine
3833920	3834920	tasting.
3834920	3839240	Well, they had two different limo buses, they had a shorter one and then they had a larger
3839240	3840240	one.
3840240	3842160	And the other one had a stripper pole in the back.
3842160	3846600	So it's just, it's just a bus, but I mean, hold on, hold on.
3846600	3850640	We need, if we're going to talk about party bus, we need party bus music.
3850640	3851640	Brilliant.
3851640	3852640	I approve.
3852640	3857820	So yeah, so they do have a stripper pole in the back and I suppose if you were to rent
3857820	3862680	it, say for a bachelor party or something, you could have strippers performing.
3862680	3868880	Now granted, it might not be the safest thing for them to be doing, but, uh, sure, why not?
3868880	3875800	So finally the lights go on in this bus and there's like, I shit you not, like 50 drunk
3875800	3880400	chicks all piled in this bus and like, it's like, it's like the lights went onto the club
3880400	3883720	at 2am and they all just start pouring out the front of the bus and go on into a little
3883720	3887280	gay club.
3887280	3891920	And that's why I stopped going to that club also, Rob, because every Friday and Saturday
3891920	3893920	night it's like, let's let all the straights in.
3893920	3897320	And there was like two gay people there and I was like, what is going on?
3897320	3910360	I haven't been there in like six years now.
3910360	3912720	I'm sorry, but I would just, I was just fascinated.
3912720	3917200	Like what if that bus, I mean that bus was a big bus and it was taking up an entire lane
3917200	3919560	and surely it doesn't turn well.
3919560	3922560	And I'm just thinking like, what if that bus gets in an accident?
3922560	3928720	You're going to have just drunk chicks pouring out the windshield.
3928720	3930640	They won't know because they're drunk.
3930640	3932760	So it doesn't matter.
3932760	3934560	That is a, that is a terrible thing.
3934560	3938680	Having a bunch of drunk chicks inside of a bus with the stripper pole, geez, that would
3938680	3939680	suck.
3939680	3943000	Well, and then all the skanky slutty twink boys that you were nice enough to call the
3943000	3946520	circuit boys, all the skanky slutty snotty twink boys that are faces won't even know
3946520	3948400	because they'll just be like, whatever.
3948400	3952640	I like how I went out of my way to not give the clubs names and then you're just like,
3952640	3954240	uh, Oh, this is interesting.
3954240	3955240	Okay.
3955240	3958520	Tiger call linked us a picture here in chat of a stripper bus.
3958520	3960160	This must be in Nevada.
3960160	3962160	It's one of the advertisement.
3962160	3963160	Yeah.
3963160	3964160	Yeah.
3964160	3965600	That's, it was close to that though.
3965600	3969760	It was close to that, but it looked a little bit more like a regular stripper bus that
3969760	3975440	looks like a billboard, a regular stripper bus or a regular bus making distinctions between
3975440	3976440	types of buses.
3976440	3978440	Anyhow, interesting.
3978440	3980720	Okay.
3980720	3983520	We should go to Japanese release date stripper pole.
3983520	3986240	That's just a pole so that you don't fall over.
3986240	3992520	You hold onto it, you know, in lieu of a seatbelt, you know, let's go to the Japanese release
3992520	3996720	dates, but we're going to make them a little more interesting tonight.
3996720	3999720	That's going to read them in Korean.

4089280	4093880	I'm trying to look at the music or the, it looks like it's just showing you chords and
4093880	4096640	this looks really boring.
4096640	4101640	I think I'd fall asleep.
4101640	4102640	I get it.
4102640	4113080	If you Jacka Jacka before bed, you'll fall asleep easier.

4154360	4156000	They're not doing rah, rah, rah.
4156000	4157520	No, you're not done.
4157520	4158780	I closed it.
4158780	4159780	That's okay.

4214680	4217400	link on air cause it has to do with the stripper bus.
4217400	4218400	Okay.
4218400	4219800	So this is a video from the onion.com.
4219800	4224120	Oh God, I only know where this is going to go again.
4224120	4225440	This is coming from the onion.com.
4225440	4231200	Uh, let me, let me stop you real quick because you did miss once and she didn't want to talk
4231200	4232200	about it.
4232200	4233200	What I missed stuff.
4233200	4238720	Um, there is a Ryoga, uh, gotoku, uh, shin show.
4238720	4242960	Um, it's, it's the, uh, Oh, great.

4244840	4249840	Uh, the Yakuza on the PSP came out this week as well.
4249840	4251840	That's a little bit of a big title for Japan.
4251840	4255200	Can I talk about the stripper bus again?
4255200	4258040	Talk about the stripper bus.
4258040	4262280	If you're just joining us, we are covering a developing story.
4262280	4267240	We go back now to Southern California where a VH1 bus crashed just a short while ago,
4267240	4271800	revealing more than 2000 pounds of slot on the interstate five-year Palmdale.
4271800	4276240	The bus was transporting contestants for the new VH1 reality series, the road to Knoxville
4276240	4280880	in which 18 scantily clad young women vie for the heart of divorce stuntman Johnny Knoxville
4280880	4284640	officials there are struggling to control the spread of slot, which has already polluted
4284640	4289360	the roadway and is spreading now down a Hillside into residential areas.
4289360	4291120	Let's go live to onion news networks.
4291120	4294720	Brian Scott, who's live on the scene, Brian, what's exactly going on out there?
4294720	4295720	Well, it's just horrible.
4295720	4300160	Anna, the highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of
4300160	4301680	this orange skinned slot.
4301680	4302960	I've only been here an hour.
4302960	4308440	I've already seen four three way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings and downwind
4308440	4312240	the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.
4312240	4313400	It sounds like quite a scene.
4313400	4317320	Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington beach early
4317320	4318320	this morning.
4318320	4319320	Is that right?
4319320	4320320	That's where it began.
4320320	4321320	Yes.
4321320	4324560	The sluts were being transported from a negligee wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl
4324560	4327280	on girl paintball match when the crash occurred.
4327280	4328280	There's speculation.
4328280	4332280	In fact, the accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on
4332280	4336160	the vehicle and getting on the drive and see now the local fire department is just not
4336160	4338280	equipped to handle something this toxic.
4338280	4342640	The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel river and officials are concerned
4342640	4346640	that the sluts might go skinny dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in
4346640	4347640	it.
4347640	4349640	We should say to the crews, they're doing their best.
4349640	4354480	They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip offs and shooter contests
4354480	4355480	in the ditch.
4355480	4356480	Finally.
4356480	4358360	Now we've just gotten word that VH1 issued a statement.
4358360	4359440	It's on their website.
4359440	4364280	It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts, but the EPA has urged VH1
4364280	4368600	to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly concentrated slut they use
4368600	4369600	now.
4369600	4370600	Yeah.
4370600	4372280	Sounds, uh, sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1 is gonna ever go for that.
4372280	4374720	Brian, stay safe out there and don't fuck any of those sluts.
4374720	4375720	All right, thanks.
4375720	4376720	Moving on.
4376720	4381040	A new Apple laptop become preloaded with a half written coming of age knob.
4381040	4384480	I fucking love the onion.
4384480	4389480	Did you see the one they did about, you have to understand that was what we saw last night.
4389480	4392240	No, I just right here in Sacramento.
4392240	4393240	Okay.
4393240	4394240	Rob, we get it.
4394240	4395240	Just say it.
4395240	4396240	Okay.
4396240	4397240	I love the onion too.
4397240	4398240	Me too.
4398240	4400840	Do you see the one about the impending, uh, a flood from Folsom dam and then creating
4400840	4406520	the Memorial for it and talking to the first person who dies in the flood.
4406520	4411000	Actually, you know what's funny, Matt and I, the, the old apartment we lived at, I mean,
4411000	4413080	we can say this now cause we don't live there anymore.
4413080	4415200	We used to live in an apartment, the old studio.
4415200	4420800	This was the studio from about episodes, what about 50 to probably like 150 were taped at
4420800	4421800	the apartment.
4421800	4424140	We're looking, I used to live together, which was right next to Folsom dam.
4424140	4427160	We live in this little apartment complex was literally right next to it.
4427160	4430760	And you know, if that dam ever broke, we'd be looking down on all the people getting
4430760	4433160	flooded out cause we were on top of the Hill.
4433160	4435160	Ah, good one.
4435160	4436160	Rob.
4436160	4438840	You're so you have so much concern for other people.
4438840	4440840	Hey, video games.
4440840	4441840	Yeah.
4441840	4442840	Loki.
4442840	4443840	Yes.
4443840	4444840	Help.
4444840	4446840	Let's talk about games.
4446840	4454200	Um, Nielsen, uh, the wonderful agency that talks about, you know, different ads and you
4454200	4455840	know, entertainment trends.
4455840	4462680	Uh, they did a study of the six EA sports titles, um, including NHL 10 and be a live
4462680	4471040	or nine, um, that had in game ad advertisements in them and a guess, um, apparently they increased
4471040	4476280	household dollars, um, spent on, um, different things by 24%.
4476280	4481940	Uh, one of them that they looked at was Gatorade and that was, uh, I guess the case there.
4481940	4482940	It's interesting.
4482940	4485600	I don't, I don't know.
4485600	4490760	I don't buy that people, you know, they see Gatorade on a billboard in the background
4490760	4492560	that they're going to really go and buy Gatorade.
4492560	4499320	I think a lot of players that play sports games for a long period of time, maybe perhaps
4499320	4504640	like drinking, you know, Gatorade or soda or whatever, and it's just a coincidence if
4504640	4505640	you ask me.
4505640	4512160	But, um, apparently they have a press release out and, uh, summarizing the different things,
4512160	4518280	um, including, I don't know, like if they cover Axe body spray or something like that.
4518280	4519280	That'd be interesting.
4519280	4523200	Actually, um, Nielsen's been running, um, studies on our show here at orange lounge
4523200	4528360	radio and it's showing that, um, after tonight's episode, it looks like, uh, we had an increase
4528360	4532360	33% of our listeners decided to go to six flags after tonight's show.
4532360	4534360	It's something else.
4534360	4537480	All right, I'll stop.
4537480	4539280	All right.
4539280	4547680	But yeah, they said the out of, um, I guess the, the panel of, uh, 100,000 households,
4547680	4553240	uh, representing the U S population according to the, I guess their home scan panel or whatever
4553240	4557680	says scanned, uh, video game, uh, UPC barcodes.
4557680	4562600	The scan barcodes were then matched to a reference library, more than 14,000 video games.
4562600	4568160	Nielsen compared the households that purchased the least of one of the studied games before
4568160	4572060	and after the Gatorade branding was integrated into the games.
4572060	4577000	The test group, uh, with the households that didn't purchase one, um, one of the games,
4577000	4581820	the control group, it says the test and control groups are projected out abroad, blah, blah.
4581820	4589160	See here it says, um, well overall they noticed that there was a 24% increase in sales after
4589160	4590160	that.
4590160	4591340	So you know what you just did?
4591340	4596120	You just opened the flood gates for them to like, you know, put in all sorts of ridiculous
4596120	4598300	stuff and way to go Nielsen.
4598300	4604320	And trust me, it's going to get ridiculous as we will get to in part B. Oh, good.
4604320	4605320	Ridiculously cool though.
4605320	4611560	I have to say, so, uh, and honestly, I think when we do talk about this, this is how you
4611560	4616240	do the advertisement because it's fucking awesome.
4616240	4617440	Now you got me all curious.
4617440	4618440	All right.
4618440	4621160	We're, we're going to be talking about Sega game.
4621160	4622160	Ooh, goodie.
4622160	4623160	All right.
4623160	4627760	Uh, moving on to a story about a lawsuit, but this is the end of a lawsuit.
4627760	4628760	Hooray.
4628760	4634480	As most of them usually end up finishing, it's the end of a 2008 lawsuit that never
4634480	4635560	went to trial.
4635560	4636560	Yes.
4636560	4638280	That's how long these things take to settle.
4638280	4639280	Who is in the lawsuit?
4639280	4641480	It was Konami and harmonics.
4641480	4643600	It was a lawsuit launched by Konami.
4643600	4647640	Uh, there was a filing in a federal court in Texas this week and the two parties agreed
4647640	4650780	to dismiss all came claims and counterclaims.
4650780	4656440	It was a suit over harmonics is rock band infringing on patents that were owned by Konami
4656440	4660960	because of course, Konami had guitar freaks many years ago, et cetera, et cetera.
4660960	4662400	Rock bands, rock revolution.
4662400	4668360	Well, remember they said rock revolution failed because the, the rock band two stuff.
4668360	4675520	Well, among other things that was maybe like, like a little sliver, like half a percent
4675520	4677360	of the reasons why anyhow.
4677360	4682440	Uh, there was also a 2009 countersuit via com actually filed it on behalf of harmonics
4682440	4684920	that was dropped in a federal court in Boston.
4684920	4688720	So that means Konami and harmonics officially kissed and made up, but we will never know
4688720	4691600	the details of it because the terms are sealed.
4691600	4692600	Was there tongue?
4692600	4693600	Perhaps.
4693600	4696440	We will not know because it's sealed.
4696440	4698040	A slut bus was involved.
4698040	4704320	I'm told actually, and they were all playing dance masters and with a stripper pole strip
4704320	4705320	masters.
4705320	4711760	Anyhow, now's the part of the show where we're going to let dark Sakura take over and, uh,
4711760	4717160	delve into the classic video game vault and, uh, choose a game for us that she thinks,
4717160	4718160	you know what?
4718160	4721680	You little brats, you should be playing this game.
4721680	4732400	It's classic video game of the week, dark Sakura, which they'd be playing is super Mario
4732400	4739680	brothers two, sweet, which, um, I actually have to think, um, Tara for suggesting super
4739680	4742320	Mario brothers, but I wanted to do super Mario brothers too.
4742320	4743320	I was actually surprised.
4743320	4745400	You have never picked this before, but you haven't.
4745400	4746400	Yeah.
4746400	4747400	You've done three, but never two.
4747400	4751200	Super Mario brothers two wasn't actually a super Mario brothers game originally.
4751200	4757080	It was called Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic, which was also on the Famicom disc system and had
4757080	4759720	an intro and an ending.
4759720	4761680	But the intro music sounds very familiar.
4761680	4764080	It's so cute.
4764080	4770080	Oh no, the kids get sucked into a book.
4770080	4771080	Little monkey boys running away.
4771080	4773440	I don't know what the little monkey is about.
4773440	4774440	He just is there.
4774440	4778360	Oh no, we four people are randomly showing up in these children's bedroom.
4778360	4780080	Let's jump into the book.
4780080	4781600	Not creepy at all.
4781600	4782600	No.
4782600	4787480	Now let's flip the disc over because like I said, Famicom disc.
4787480	4788480	So anyway.
4788480	4789480	Um, what do you want to hear?
4789480	4790480	Doki Doki Panic music?
4790480	4791480	It's the same thing.
4791480	4792480	Yeah, pretty much.
4792480	4795960	Although it's funny, some of the sound effects are different and they did, uh, uh, other
4795960	4800960	sprite swaps like these weird looking head things were there, but they turned them into
4800960	4804280	mushrooms and yeah.
4804280	4805720	And this one, um.
4805720	4811120	So you pulled heads out of the grounds instead of like, you know, no different cause that'd
4811120	4812120	be really cool.
4812120	4816560	You pull the vegetables out of the ground instead of these masks are sitting there instead
4816560	4820500	of the mushroom blocks.
4820500	4825680	At any rate, um, the whole thought that Nintendo had was that the original Super Mario Brothers
4825680	4829560	2 that came out in 1986 was too hard.
4829560	4835320	Oh no, American players, which is stupid because Japanese RPGs are ridiculously easy to start
4835320	4836320	off.
4836320	4839040	Did you ever play Final Fantasy 7 in Japanese?
4839040	4840040	Uh, not gonna.
4840040	4841040	Freaking easy.
4841040	4842040	No.
4842040	4843040	It's like hit dead.
4843040	4844040	Hit dead.
4844040	4845040	So easy.
4845040	4846040	But it is very, very hard.
4846040	4847040	The original Super Mario 2.
4847040	4848040	Oh yeah.
4848040	4850600	The Mario, when it came out as lost levels here on the, on the Super Nintendo cartridge,
4850600	4853600	um, the All Stars or whatever, it was really hard.
4853600	4854600	Yeah.
4854600	4857880	Beat it eventually, but it was, it was a hard game.
4857880	4866440	Well, um, so what they did is, um, they took, uh, Doki Doki Panic and they, uh, I guess
4866440	4869360	resprided it with the main characters and changed a few things.
4869360	4874880	Like, they, because I guess there was more capacity to do stuff on the cartridge, they,
4874880	4880040	um, they actually just, uh, could put in some more graphical elements.
4880040	4884240	And of course, one thing that you'll notice listening to the two, um, different tracks
4884240	4888240	is because the sound processor is just a little bit different for the games on disc versus
4888240	4889240	the games.
4889240	4893280	Like, if you ever listen to Legend of Zelda on disc from the disc system, the music sounds
4893280	4894280	different.
4894280	4898680	I mean, it's the same music, but it's, it uses different instrumentation, but anyway.
4898680	4905120	And different sound effects, um, like, uh, like the bird thing squawks differently and
4905120	4908280	it doesn't have the bonus game, like that has a different looking bonus game.
4908280	4913280	Um, anyway, uh, so they did this because it was gonna, you know, they thought it would
4913280	4920400	be more popular and that it would be, be, uh, you know, fun and easy and, and since
4920400	4927040	then it actually came out in Japan in 1992 as Super Mario USA, um, which came out with
4927040	4928040	Super Mario All-Stars.
4928040	4930240	So, we each got something fun.
4930240	4937400	Um, but so yeah, you walk around and you throw potions down, which in the, uh, original,
4937400	4942720	in the Doki Doki Panic, it's, uh, magic lamps, because it has sort of this, I guess, of Arabian
4942720	4948720	Nights kind of theme in all these other levels, but you get your power-ups by going into these
4948720	4957480	little reverse universe things and in Super Mario, um, 2, the, of course, our US one,
4957480	4964840	you can play as Mario, who is like the all-around average dude, or Luigi, who is, uh, I always
4964840	4970000	called him crazy legs dude, because his legs spin, but he jumps higher than anybody else.
4970000	4973440	And you can play Toad, who, by the way, is not useless, you play Toad when you need to
4973440	4979400	dig a lot, because he digs faster, or when you're trying to get those extra power-ups.
4979400	4982100	Who was a chick in Doki Doki Panic, right?
4982100	4985080	The blue character was a girl, wasn't it?
4985080	4986540	That was, but that wasn't Toad.
4986540	4987540	That was Mario.
4987540	4988840	Oh, my bad.
4988840	4993320	Yeah, um, and then you've got Princess, who was the pink chick with the hair and pants
4993320	4995580	in the Doki Doki Panic.
4995580	4996880	But she can float, though.
4996880	4998520	Yes, she can float.
4998520	5001640	Um, but Toad can't jump for shit.
5001640	5006640	Anyway, you get POW blocks, which blow up things, and they're really fun.
5006640	5011640	And, um, it had a life meter, which was unique for Mario game, you know, instead of your
5011640	5012640	different sizes.
5012640	5019520	But it was really stupid, because, like, if you lose one of your little segments there,
5019520	5024160	then, um, you have to kill, like, a certain number of enemies so that you can get a heart
5024160	5029200	to come up, and then you, you know, whatever, you will refill it.
5029200	5031520	Um, also, to get your star.
5031520	5038160	And I have to thank the irate gamer for this analogy, because it was spot on.
5038160	5042680	You have to get, like, five cherries, and then your star will show up for your invincibility,
5042680	5045840	except it takes forever to get to where you are, unless you're at the very bottom of the
5045840	5047040	screen.
5047040	5050600	And the way he described it, you have time to take a shit before the star arrives, which
5050600	5051600	he proceeded to do.
5051600	5054480	And I have to thank him for demonstrating that.
5054480	5055480	Wow.
5055480	5056480	Yes.
5056480	5065600	Um, anyway, you, if you, uh, pull up the little, uh, plants in the little reverse universe,
5065600	5070680	then you get coins, which you can use for a bonus game, which is basically, like, slots.
5070680	5073960	And there, there's a pattern to it, and I used to always be able to get the pattern
5073960	5076320	where you'd always get them to match.
5076320	5077320	But it's-
5077320	5081040	It seemed like if you hit the button really fast, you could usually win it.
5081040	5087280	It was, it was like, for me, it was like, you hit one, and then you hit the next two
5087280	5089160	twice as fast.
5089160	5093600	It's, it is, it was like a duh-duh-duh was my rhythm.
5093600	5098800	And I always, and I always got it, so, I guess it depends.
5098800	5102560	Um, of course, if you also hit the button, like, really right away, like, after you've
5102560	5107200	gotten a cherry, then you'll always get a cherry on the next one, so.
5107200	5110280	So I would have, like, 50 million lives by, by the time I was done.
5110280	5115720	Um, you've also got little, uh, warp zones, where if you throw your little jar at the
5115720	5117720	right spot, it goes down.
5117720	5120200	Ooh, you got audio issues going on.
5120200	5122880	Um, were the warp zones in Doki Doki Panic?
5122880	5124360	Yes, they were.
5124360	5125360	Interesting.
5125360	5129240	In fact, if you watch the playthrough, um, cause I linked a playthrough for Doki Doki
5129240	5130240	Panic.
5130240	5131440	Which is all you need to see of Doki Doki Panic, really.
5131440	5132680	It really wasn't the better game.
5132680	5136560	Like, a lot of people are like, oh, you know, it was the original, duh-duh-duh, but they
5136560	5138760	made improvements when they brought it over here.
5138760	5143000	Yeah, well, keep in mind, they had more, if I'm right, they had more storage capacity.
5143000	5146720	The only thing that we're missing is the dinky little intro, which you had to flip the disk
5146720	5151040	anyway to start off with, and then flip to play the game, and then flip to go back, and
5151040	5153960	flip and flip and flip, and whatever, got tired of flipping off.
5153960	5157840	So, but yeah, all the, all the warps and everything were there, you just throw them where there's
5157840	5161520	a particular jar, you go down the jar, boom, you're somewhere else.
5161520	5163960	And I love this little trick for, what is it, 6-1?
5163960	5167440	Yeah, if you hear the sound, like, going crazy in the background, it's cause they're doing
5167440	5170720	this trick where they go under the quicksand, and then jump, jump through the wall type
5170720	5171720	of thing.
5171720	5172720	Yeah.
5172720	5175160	It, that was, that was always one of my favorite tricks.
5175160	5180360	And there's also one in the very last level, where if you climb up to one screen in the,
5180360	5185200	in the final castle, and then you let yourself fall and then jump, you will actually can
5185200	5187600	skip, like, a whole bunch of screens.
5187600	5190960	Although for me, I was, like, playing everything through.
5190960	5200480	So, yeah, uh, it was, uh, they actually were planning on, um, releasing, uh, Doki Doki
5200480	5206080	Panic in the US at some point, but they actually just didn't.
5206080	5212720	And so they, they, you know, one thing about this, though, is that the reason why it does
5212720	5217840	kind of fit in musically, and with sound effects, is cause the, um, the soundtrack was composed
5217840	5218840	by Koji Kondo.
5218840	5219840	Oh, okay.
5219840	5225840	So it's very interesting to me, like, how much this ended up kind of just becoming a
5225840	5228320	part of the Mario mythos, if you will.
5228320	5232280	Like, you know, later Mario games had some of these characters that first appeared in
5232280	5235960	really Doki Doki Panic kind of crossed over into the Mario universe, especially like some
5235960	5241220	of the, I want to say, like, uh, the second Yoshi game on Super Nintendo, like, a lot
5241220	5243880	of those monsters kind of were from this game.
5243880	5248480	Yeah, because it was so popular that they really just ended up incorporating it into
5248480	5251880	the whole Mario branding, I guess.
5251880	5256520	As much as you might want to think Nintendo was kind of rude for dumbing it down, it really
5256520	5257520	worked for them.
5257520	5258520	It did.
5258520	5260520	On multiple levels, in this case.
5260520	5263200	It was interesting to me, though, just real quick, sorry, I know you have more you want
5263200	5267840	to say, but, um, it was really interesting to me how this game really fit into the very
5267840	5272480	odd 8-bit sequels that were nothing like the originals, in many ways.
5272480	5276280	You know, you had this, you had Castlevania II Simon's Quest, which was a huge departure
5276280	5280120	from the original, Zelda II was a huge departure from the original, it was very interesting
5280120	5284400	how a lot of games, you know, were so different back then.
5284400	5288720	It was just how it was done, you know, I think it was more of a desire to innovate and keep
5288720	5293280	people interested, but one thing that, you know, and I think that's what they finally
5293280	5297720	end up realizing is that people usually like the original games for a reason, and kind
5297720	5302160	of want to keep them around, although, I remember playing this game, I rented it when I was
5302160	5306480	a kid, and was just like, see, that's where you can go over all the screens, and I was
5306480	5310400	just sort of like, what the crap, Nintendo, what'd you do this to me for, what's this
5310400	5315040	ostrich thing spitting eggs at me, and then I liked it.
5315040	5322280	Um, so, at any rate, um, we, uh, later on, there were the re-releases, there were Super
5322280	5330800	Mario All-Stars, which was really sweet, and then, um, there was, you remember the Satellaview,
5330800	5337120	Mario was a, uh, Gaiden version that was, um, Super Mario All-Stars on Satellaview,
5337120	5343120	and it, it was called BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge, and so it ran in weekly volumes
5343120	5345120	like all the other Satellaview games.
5345120	5354840	Um, then we got Super Mario Advance, which was, um, the Super Mario Brothers 2, which
5354840	5360680	actually was a lot harder, but it had some innovations that kept the game fresh, I think,
5360680	5361680	for a lot of people.
5361680	5363480	I, I really liked it.
5363480	5370560	And so it's, uh, Super Mario 2, or as the original was, because I, I think I'd have
5370560	5377960	to lump the games together, is that it was, uh, Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.
5377960	5384480	And actually, since I'm talking about that too, um, they did a Mario-style poster based
5384480	5389260	off of the original cover for Doki Doki Panic.
5389260	5391480	And the characters that were in there, um, was-
5391480	5394840	I just want to point out in the time you've been talking, someone beat Mario 2 here on
5394840	5395840	YouTube.
5395840	5396840	Yeah.
5396840	5397840	That's pretty amazing.
5397840	5398840	I gotta say, that's pretty amazing.
5398840	5399840	And by the way, I was-
5399840	5400840	You cut out again.
5400840	5401840	You cut out again.
5401840	5402840	You scared to us.
5402840	5403840	That mic is, is getting dated.
5403840	5406760	I, no, the mic is new, I need a new cord.
5406760	5407760	Yeah.
5407760	5412960	At any rate, um, Imogene was, um, the, one of the little Toad-looking characters.
5412960	5418160	And then there was Mama, who was the one in the blue, that was Luigi.
5418160	5424240	And then there was Lina, who was the pink princess harem girl.
5424240	5430120	And uh, Papa, who, who became Toad.
5430120	5437160	And he actually, um, I think became a, no, the, no, I'm wrong.
5437160	5438160	Forget I said anything.
5438160	5439160	Anyway.
5439160	5440160	Okay.
5440160	5444040	Um, oh, now here's the differences, um, different title screen.
5444040	5449240	And then, um, the story takes place in the storybook instead of in the dream world.
5449240	5455240	And um, you have a save feature, because it was on the disk system.
5455240	5457840	You cannot run with the B button.
5457840	5462620	There, like I said, different music changes, different graphical changes.
5462620	5467160	And you need fewer hits to hit wart in Doki Doki Panic than in Super Mario 2.
5467160	5469720	The waterfall is faster than in Super Mario 2.
5469720	5474720	And of course different sound effects because of the, uh, the number of pins between the
5474720	5479320	Famicom disk and the full-size NES cartridges.
5479320	5481060	And there you go.
5481060	5482220	So it's sort of a split one.
5482220	5488400	We have, it's Yumikojo, Doki Doki Panic, and, um, Super Mario Bros. 2.
5488400	5489600	All right.
5489600	5495800	There it is, your classic game of the week, Mario 2, here in the US, or Doki Doki Panic
5495800	5497000	overseas.
5497000	5498100	Good pick.
5498100	5499800	One that I'm sure a lot of people remember.
5499800	5500800	All right.
5500800	5503440	We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5503440	5504440	We're going to be right back.
5504440	5506360	There's plenty more to come tonight in part B of our show.
5506360	5508920	We're actually going to get into some more of the news that's coming out of Tokyo Game
5508920	5509920	Show.
5509920	5510920	We didn't do a lot this segment.
5510920	5511920	We've got plenty more to come.
5511920	5516160	Of course, your calls and tweets and emails, of which I'm sure there's plenty.
5516160	5517560	We're going to get to all those.
5517560	5519320	And more Rice Princess and the Doctor.
5519320	5520320	Yay.
5520320	5521320	Maybe.
5521320	5522320	If I don't kick them off the show.
5522320	5523320	Yes, it's going to happen.
5523320	5524320	All right.
5524320	5527080	No, they'll be here to tell more poop jokes when we return.
5527080	5535160	With more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5535160	5538720	And welcome back, everybody, to the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, live here at
5538720	5544080	All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock
5544080	5548160	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
5548160	5550920	Going back over to Dark Sakura for a minute here, because she was talking about something
5550920	5553300	during break that I thought was fascinating.
5553300	5556320	You mentioned you were telling Rice Princess about some documentary you've been watching
5556320	5557320	lately.
5557320	5558320	What is this?
5558320	5559320	It's not a documentary.
5559320	5562920	I'm watching a Japanese drama from 2006 called Gal Circle.
5562920	5568880	That's about these, like, these girls that, you know, are homeless and live in Shinjuku.
5568880	5571920	They quit school to go be Para Para dancers.
5571920	5575840	And they hang out in this warehouse and, you know, leech free food wherever they can find
5575840	5576840	it.
5576840	5582280	And it's a, it's a cute show, but like one of the characters is, um.
5582280	5583280	What the hell?
5583280	5588520	I'm listening to something, coming from the living room, that's like, Dan's watching the
5588520	5589760	Angry Nintendo Nerd.
5589760	5591200	Oh God.
5591200	5597080	Anyway, um, so, but like the whole thing starts off with these, uh, US troops dropping somebody
5597080	5599240	on, on, uh, Shinjuku.
5599240	5602120	And it's this guy dressed up as a cowboy named Shinosuke.
5602120	5605220	Cause you know, all Americans are cowboys.
5605220	5606320	From Arizona.
5606320	5612720	And he lives the Indian lifestyle and he's good friends with Geronimo, who is this Japanese
5612720	5615720	guy in Arizona dressed up like an Indian.
5615720	5618360	And he actually looks the part.
5618360	5619760	Sounds amazingly racist, I love it.
5619760	5624760	And this little girl named Momo, who, they're all like speaking random English.
5624760	5625760	It's hilarious.
5625760	5626760	So it's not a documentary.
5626760	5629800	It's just, it's just a dramedy.
5629800	5631800	It's a dorama.
5631800	5633680	Oh, okay.
5633680	5638640	And but it's like this guy completely knows nothing of Japanese life and he's teaching
5638640	5641180	the girls these lessons through his innocence and.
5641180	5644560	And they teach him the magic of dance.
5644560	5649760	I'm on, I'm on the fourth episode now out of 11 and it's, uh, it's pretty funny.
5649760	5652040	I don't know how I miss this.
5652040	5654040	Yeah, I think I'll watch more Hoarders.
5654040	5658040	All right, Rob, teach me the magic of dance.
5658040	5659040	Excuse me.
5659040	5660040	Sorry.
5660040	5661040	Not time for Twitter topics yet.
5661040	5662040	Be quiet.
5662040	5663040	All right.
5663040	5664040	Hey.
5664040	5665040	I was listening.
5665040	5668520	I was at the club the other night and I actually heard a song and the lyrics were, and the
5668520	5673840	song is called commander and the lyrics were tonight I'll be your commander and I command
5673840	5677400	you to dance.
5677400	5678400	That's where that came from.
5678400	5679400	Yeah.
5679400	5680400	That was my favorite.
5680400	5681400	A little bit homosexual.
5681400	5682400	Just a little.
5682400	5689040	Was it, was it commander or commander command like a Commodore 64 commander better?
5689040	5690480	It was no.
5690480	5694600	When I tell you who it was singing it, that's how you'll know how homosexual it was.
5694600	5695600	You ready?
5695600	5696600	Yes.
5696600	5697600	Kelly Rowland.
5697600	5698600	Wow.
5698600	5703680	Like the not Beyonce, but yeah, Beyonce, the other chick from Destiny's Child.
5703680	5704680	Yes.
5704680	5705680	Exactly.
5705680	5706680	I can't believe it's not Beyonce.
5706680	5707680	Hey, video game news.
5707680	5708680	Oh my God.
5708680	5709680	Who knew we did that on this show?
5709680	5711720	Uh, a lot of quick video game news tonight.
5711720	5712720	Holy hell.
5712720	5714120	There's a lot of quick news tonight.
5714120	5719080	And um, I believe Loki has a story starting off about fantasy star, but I want to say
5719080	5724640	this first because this somehow did not even make our show roll, which is a travesty.
5724640	5729240	Fantasy star online two teased in a trailer this week at Tokyo game show.
5729240	5730240	What in the world?
5730240	5731240	I know, right?
5731240	5734200	The, because it's the 10th anniversary of fantasy star online and they have announced
5734200	5738960	that next year they're going to put out fantasy star online two for PC.
5738960	5740080	I'll play it.
5740080	5741240	But it's not on console.
5741240	5742800	That's weird to me that it's not on console.
5742800	5744120	I'm wondering what they're going to do with it.
5744120	5746480	They're still getting to MMOs on consoles.
5746480	5751640	I mean, at least like the PlayStation three and Xbox 360 because so far this generation
5751640	5754960	there's been Final Fantasy 11.
5754960	5755960	Wasn't there another one on 360?
5755960	5757960	Oh, fantasy star universe.
5757960	5758960	Haha.
5758960	5759960	Yeah, sort of.
5759960	5762880	But that had a more of a single player component to it though.
5762880	5764360	It wasn't just an MMO.
5764360	5767320	This shut down.
5767320	5768320	The game would still be playable.
5768320	5769800	It's like a really bad anime.
5769800	5770800	All right, sorry.
5770800	5773240	I didn't mean to derail your story, Loki, but I had to throw that out there.
5773240	5778360	Before the break, we were talking about advertisement and games and you know how it's kind of terrible
5778360	5779360	sometimes.
5779360	5780360	Well, this is how you do it.
5780360	5786280	Damn it, because I couldn't think of a better way to possibly advertise in the game than
5786280	5789080	how it's done in fantasy star portable two.
5789080	5794760	What, may you ask, is actually the case with this?
5794760	5799720	You can play Colonel Sanders in fantasy star portable two.
5799720	5800720	That is awesome.
5800720	5801720	Wait, wait, wait.
5801720	5802720	Like a playable character?
5802720	5804280	Like a playable character.
5804280	5807840	Like the Colonel is there to kick ass.
5807840	5814840	Back from the dead with his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices.
5814840	5820920	I read some story that like most kids under 18 don't even know who Colonel Sanders is.
5820920	5826920	Like, oh, but he's going to come and bitch slap him in the face now.
5826920	5828480	Now you'll remember me forever.
5828480	5833540	No, but seriously, it's, um, they put him in the game and this isn't a big surprise
5833540	5837880	because actually, I believe it's in the upgraded version of fantasy star portable two.
5837880	5839760	It's infinity, I guess.
5839760	5844560	And the original fantasy star portable two actually had pizza hut stuff in there with
5844560	5846640	like a pizza hut box shield.
5846640	5853400	Oh hell, you know what that means coming in the next fantasy star game is Taco Bell.
5853400	5855260	Make a run for the PSP.
5855260	5857200	Or the noid comes back as a playable character.
5857200	5858800	Dude, the noid would be awesome.
5858800	5864320	I'm sorry, but if anyone's seen the anime project Aco, you don't mess with the Colonel.
5864320	5866320	It's the Colonel.
5866320	5870520	Oh, that's so ridiculous.
5870520	5872680	Lee awesome.
5872680	5873680	It is awesome.
5873680	5877760	So instead of casting like the typical like ice fire bolt spells, you'll be casting like,
5877760	5886520	you know, Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, heart attack, grease fire, KFC bowl, double
5886520	5893880	down the, the bowl that looks like poop, wait, wait, wait.
5893880	5894880	That's nasty.
5894880	5899000	And they have pictures of him attacking stuff.
5899000	5903740	So I'm trying to see what he, look, it almost looks like, and I kid you not, and I don't
5903740	5907200	understand this, but it almost looks like he has a magic wand.
5907200	5912040	Like he's fucking Harry Potter of the, you know, fast food world or something.
5912040	5917040	Um, he's like hitting some, yeah, seriously looking like he's bitch slapping someone right
5917040	5918040	there.
5918040	5919760	Uh, this is all on Famitsu of course.
5919760	5923720	I got it one more here cause it looks like he's throwing a fireball or something.
5923720	5925600	Uh, God, I love the Japanese.
5925600	5928800	Yeah, he's got like, seriously, he's got like a magical wand.
5928800	5937360	I mean Colonel Sanders, dude, you put your name in the Goblet of Fire, going to our chat
5937360	5944320	room and chat that orange lounge radio.com, um, SSG100 Matt says, gravy heel, please.
5944320	5949920	Uh, Vid, Vid Power says, when are they going to make a fighter featuring the Arby's oven
5949920	5950920	mitt?
5950920	5953360	Uh, DDR dollar bill says you're Juan Sanders.
5953360	5956840	Is it made from chicken feather?
5956840	5960960	I seriously think a great, cause you know how Burger King does their stupid, like, you
5960960	5966120	know, Burger King games, which I will, by the way, fucking rad, which is by the way,
5966120	5968840	when they do release their Kinect games, I'm buying all of them.
5968840	5972200	I don't care how terrible they are, because they're awesome.
5972200	5977240	Seriously, KFC needs to come up with like an original game where it's like, oh, kids
5977240	5981680	don't know who Colonel Sanders is, he's back to kick some fucking ass with his magical
5981680	5982680	wand.
5982680	5984000	He's a fucking ninja, that's what he is.
5984000	5985840	Ooh, I'm back from the dead, ooh.
5985840	5988600	He's gonna battle Voldemort as well.
5988600	5990840	Is it bad that your little thing is blinking red?
5990840	5992080	Does that mean it's gonna explode?
5992080	5993960	Nah, it just means the battery's low.
5993960	5994960	Okay.
5994960	5997160	This means I won't have internet after a while.
5997160	5998160	I'm so worried.
5998160	5999160	Alright.
5999160	6000160	It means the time bomb's going off.
6000160	6001160	Oh no.
6001160	6002160	I'm in my house.
6002160	6004080	This show will self-destruct in 30 seconds.
6004080	6005560	You brought Burger King into my house.
6005560	6006560	Hasn't it already?
6006560	6010640	Yeah, it's alright, anyways, I should finish my downloads when I get home, cause this is
6010640	6011640	so slow.
6011640	6012640	What are you downloading?
6012640	6013640	Apps.
6013640	6014640	Wow.
6014640	6016440	I'm downloading the two Monkey Island apps.
6016440	6017440	Oh.
6017440	6018440	Sweet.
6018440	6020840	But I thought those, that's not like a 4G router?
6020840	6023200	No, it's just 3G.
6023200	6024200	Oh.
6024200	6026640	I don't know anything about it, sorry.
6026640	6027640	Next story.
6027640	6028640	But yeah.
6028640	6032680	I'm sorry, it's just so awesome that we have to keep talking about the kernel.
6032680	6037620	So Halo Reach, of course, you know, one of the big things with Halo, and it's kinda become
6037620	6039600	infamous because of it.
6039600	6044160	The horrible people on Xbox Live, and it's a lot of little kids that really shouldn't
6044160	6045160	be playing-
6045160	6048960	I love when you start off the horrible people on Xbox Live.
6048960	6053740	It really, there's just a bunch of little kids that have no, should have no business
6053740	6055040	playing this game.
6055040	6057080	They're on there playing this game.
6057080	6063480	So if you run across some douchebags that are playing the game and being jerks online
6063480	6069360	and you mute them, if enough people mute them, they will just be auto-muted by everybody.
6069360	6074160	So you won't have to listen to them over a period of time, so.
6074160	6078360	But they just like to call people fun, amazing guys.
6078360	6079840	Yep.
6079840	6082480	Uh, yes.
6082480	6083800	Wow.
6083800	6087000	I praise your heterosexuality.
6087000	6090800	We are friends.
6090800	6093940	So that's available, of course, now.
6093940	6100960	And then, apparently, who would have thought, the PSP2 is in the works, and in fact, the
6100960	6105760	Mortal Kombat developers have a development unit of it right now.
6105760	6111960	They say it's a pretty powerful machine, and that they will be working on games for it,
6111960	6117760	and they said it's, they don't even have a 3DS yet, but apparently they have a PSP2.
6117760	6124000	Perhaps the PSP2 will be launching next year, soon, hmm, maybe?
6124000	6128400	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what they do to enhance stuff on that.
6128400	6131960	Wow, newsflash, a PSP2 is in development, shock and awe.
6131960	6136200	Yeah, but the news is that they- File that next to Duh, and of course.
6136200	6141240	But the news is that they have a unit, and that it would probably be close to be releasing.
6141240	6142840	Next year's E3.
6142840	6144280	I'm sure it will be next holiday.
6144280	6145280	For next holiday.
6145280	6150040	Alongside Shattered Memories 2, the next winner of the E3 game.
6150040	6153520	Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio, three games analysts.
6153520	6154520	Ah, yes.
6154520	6156160	Analists, sorry, analists.
6156160	6162880	And Red Faction Armageddon is coming May 2011 next year, and of course that'll be the next
6162880	6166840	big game from the Saints Row developers.
6166840	6172760	And speaking of Saints Row, they will be putting out a new Saints Row game next fall.
6172760	6173760	So sad.
6173760	6174760	So far away.
6174760	6175760	I love that game.
6175760	6178360	I know you do.
6178360	6179800	It's so terribly awesome.
6179800	6181520	It really is.
6181520	6185840	Well something maybe you could play in the meantime would be PopCap World, because PopCap
6185840	6191200	and NCSoft have teamed up to bring you PopCap World, oh boy, because you have NCSoft who
6191200	6194800	makes those highly addictive Korean MMOs, and then some of the ones over here too such
6194800	6197440	as Ion and Guild Wars.
6197440	6204440	And then PopCap, makers of virtual crack, like Pagle, Plants and Zombies, and Bejeweled.
6204440	6208460	PopCap and NCSoft have come together to bring PopCap World.
6208460	6210320	This platform will be launching later this year.
6210320	6214840	It's going to be operated by NCSoft, it's going to feature 13 PopCap titles at launch.
6214840	6219320	It's going to be free, with optional premium paid elements to be added later.
6219320	6223640	It's going to have Bejeweled, and Plants vs. Zombies, and an all new multiplayer game called
6223640	6225600	Super Zuma.
6225600	6230720	Here's the other thing you should know about this, it's only for Korea, so it's not coming
6230720	6231720	out here.
6231720	6233800	Why the fuck did you tell us, Rob?
6233800	6235920	Because I just want you to know what you're missing out on.
6235920	6240680	Super Zuma, by the way, was quote, built exclusively for Korean players.
6240680	6246160	So Super Zuma apparently uses Starcraft characters.
6246160	6248640	And the screen is very narrow for their eyes.
6248640	6249640	Stop it.
6249640	6252180	Hey, I can say it, I'm Asian.
6252180	6253180	You can say it.
6253180	6254180	Yes I can.
6254180	6255180	Alright.
6255180	6257760	So yeah, that's going to be interesting.
6257760	6261800	I'm surprised they won't release that here, but maybe Facebook games are doing well enough
6261800	6262800	for them here.
6262800	6265160	Did they ever release the Zuma game on Facebook?
6265160	6266160	I don't know.
6266160	6267160	I think they did zoom on Facebook.
6267160	6268160	I think they were going to.
6268160	6271920	They were going to do zoom on Facebook, and then of course there's Bejeweled.
6271920	6274960	And now it's all about just cross-promoting their iPhone apps, that's how they're making
6274960	6275960	money.
6275960	6277800	Loki, do you have Plants vs. Zombies on your new iPod Touch?
6277800	6279280	Yes I do, it's very fun.
6279280	6280280	Awesome!
6280280	6282560	Oh yeah, I played a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies this week.
6282560	6283560	For the first time.
6283560	6285920	Can you believe I've never played that game before, and I finally played it this week
6285920	6286920	on Xbox Live?
6286920	6288360	Crazy, I've never played it.
6288360	6289360	It's crack rock.
6289360	6292280	I mean, I've played a zillion and one tower defense games before, it's just, you know,
6292280	6293280	this is another one.
6293280	6294400	But it's cute.
6294400	6295400	It's pop-crack.
6295400	6296400	Mm-hmm.
6296400	6297400	Mm-hmm.
6297400	6298400	Hey!
6298400	6301040	Speaking of other crack games, some people really love these games.
6301040	6303680	Muramasa, the Demon Blade, and Odin Sphere.
6303680	6308600	Yeah, these games are being remade in HD if rumors are to be believed.
6308600	6310280	This is only rumor right now.
6310280	6315480	The re-releases are highly likely for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
6315480	6316480	Here's the giveaway.
6316480	6319480	They're being listed by the Australia ratings board as multi-platform.
6319480	6321480	Hmm.
6321480	6325160	Odin Sphere, of course, was originally on the PS2, Muramasa on the Wii.
6325160	6329460	That would be kind of awesome if those games were re-released.
6329460	6332880	The Last Guardian finally has a release date.
6332880	6333880	Holiday 2011.
6333880	6337600	You might remember, this was the game they showed, I think, in a trailer.
6337600	6340760	Didn't they show this for the first time, like, last year's E3?
6340760	6341760	I don't know.
6341760	6343640	But they finally showed it at Tokyo Game Show.
6343640	6344640	Another trailer.
6344640	6345640	Oh.
6345640	6346640	This is the Aiko show.
6346640	6347640	Yes.
6347640	6348640	The Colossus continuation.
6348640	6349640	Yes.
6349640	6350640	Holiday 2011.
6350640	6351640	It looks epic.
6351640	6352640	I mean, I gotta say.
6352640	6353640	I'd play it.
6353640	6354640	Yeah.
6354640	6355640	It has a big, cute sort of puppy thing.
6355640	6356640	Mm-hmm.
6356640	6357640	I'd play it.
6357640	6358640	Well, there's a whole little trailer here that was from Tokyo Game Show.
6358640	6359640	I'll play a little clip here.
6359640	6360640	I don't want to play the whole thing.
6360640	6361640	But you can see...
6361640	6362640	Excuse me.
6362640	6363640	Sorry.
6363640	6364640	I watched this the other day.
6364640	6365640	Look at that.
6365640	6366640	There's that giant puppy thing.
6366640	6368640	I don't know what the hell it is, but I'd play it.
6368640	6370640	It looks like it's gonna crap on that guy.
6370640	6371640	Probably because it is.
6371640	6373640	Silent Hill is the poopy game.
6373640	6374640	It's a dog, so...
6374640	6375640	All right.
6375640	6378600	Speaking of Aiko and Shadow of the Colossus, the collection that's been rumored for the
6378600	6381120	past couple weeks, it's true.
6381120	6385720	It's HD remakes coming exclusively to the PlayStation 3.
6385720	6387360	They're also in 3D.
6387360	6388360	Wow.
6388360	6389360	But whatever.
6389360	6391880	At least they're 2D as well.
6391880	6392880	Yeah.
6392880	6396080	They're coming to the PlayStation 3.
6396080	6397580	They won't name a release date.
6397580	6403720	They're just saying soon, but of course the retailers were rumoring April 2011.
6403720	6407680	Sony Computer Entertainment America actually confirmed later spring 2011.
6407680	6409240	So it's coming.
6409240	6412800	There's box art and everything, and there's a trailer for that as well.
6412800	6416640	The game looks sexy as hell, and I'm gonna admit, I didn't really play these games the
6416640	6417640	first time around.
6417640	6419200	I watched Loki play one of them.
6419200	6421520	I watched a certain unnamed person play them.
6421520	6422520	Really?
6422520	6423520	Yeah.
6423520	6424520	Are they hot?
6424520	6429400	Yeah, all that Aiko is is this girl making a stupid noise following you, and then Shadow
6429400	6432280	of the Colossus is like you're climbing a guy and killing him.
6432280	6433280	I don't know.
6433280	6434280	I mean, I'm sure it would be fun if you played it.
6434280	6437280	You make these sound so stupid, but they're like some of the highest critically acclaimed
6437280	6438280	games.
6438280	6439280	You know, when you watch it, it's like, I don't know.
6439280	6443080	It was boring to me, but I think if I played it, I'd probably like it better.
6443080	6445360	Comment from our chat room from Spazinator PSN.
6445360	6449120	Does that puppy thing remind you of the Luck Dragon from The Never Ending Story?
6449120	6450120	Falkor?
6450120	6451120	Fuck yeah.
6451120	6452120	Kinda.
6452120	6454120	Didn't he always sound like he was high?
6454120	6455120	Falkor?
6455120	6459720	He's like, oh yeah, scratch my ear.
6459720	6463960	Also, get me some munchies, could ya?
6463960	6466960	I've been laying here for like six hours really high.
6466960	6467960	Sorry.
6467960	6468960	Derailing.
6468960	6469960	No, that's okay.
6469960	6471000	It happens on the show as well.
6471000	6473600	So where is Frank West in Dead Rising 2?
6473600	6477320	He isn't showing up in the game and, you know, Frank West, of course, was the main character
6477320	6478760	in Dead Rising 1.
6478760	6479760	Well, he's been found.
6479760	6480760	He's covered wars, you know.
6480760	6481760	What?
6481760	6483440	I said he's covered wars, you know.
6483440	6484440	That's right.
6484440	6489200	He's coming to a new game called Dead Rising Case West.
6489200	6490200	That's right.
6490200	6492200	It's an epilogue to Dead Rising 2.
6492200	6493200	Aha!
6493200	6496280	So Dead Rising Case 0 was the prologue.
6496280	6499120	Case West will now be the epilogue.
6499120	6500120	Get it?
6500120	6501120	Cool.
6501120	6503200	That's why you've seen photos of the two characters standing next to each other.
6503200	6505120	Case West is gonna be a download title.
6505120	6507960	It's gonna be exclusive on the Xbox 360.
6507960	6513400	It will have co-op play where one of you is Chuck and one of you is Frank.
6513400	6514400	Cool.
6514400	6519880	Sorry to my gay friends, but no word about hot man-on-man action with the Chuck and Frank.
6519880	6521160	Boo!
6521160	6522160	Next topic.
6522160	6523160	Okay.
6523160	6525280	No gayness in this one.
6525280	6529640	On that topic, does Dark Star, you've heard of the Doctor Who game, right?
6529640	6530640	Yes.
6530640	6533240	And, you know, considering how the Russell T. Davies is like the head of Doctor Who,
6533240	6536680	do you think there'll be any man-on-man action in the game?
6536680	6537840	We need Captain Jack in it.
6537840	6541640	We need Captain Jack and the 50 million gay kisses he has on Torchwood.
6541640	6542640	Yes.
6542640	6543640	Yeah.
6543640	6545640	Oh, you've heard about the new season of Torchwood.
6545640	6546640	Hold on.
6546640	6547640	The gay alarm is going off.
6547640	6548640	The show got too gay.
6548640	6549640	What?
6549640	6550640	What?
6550640	6551640	Good job.
6551640	6552640	Sorry, John Barrowman.
6552640	6553640	We're in Rob Network.
6553640	6554640	We're going down the homosexual limit.
6554640	6555640	That's right.
6555640	6559920	We just got an order from the police department of Sacramento to turn down the gayness a little
6559920	6560920	bit, please.
6560920	6561920	All right.
6561920	6562920	Man up, guys.
6562920	6563920	Too late.
6563920	6564920	Too late.
6564920	6565920	Well, how about some other news, Rob?
6565920	6566920	Yes.
6566920	6572600	How about Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has characters that make me absolutely absolutely mad.
6572600	6573600	Absolutely.
6573600	6574600	Really, really happy.
6574600	6575600	Horny.
6575600	6576600	Wow.
6576600	6577600	I thought this was what she was going to say.
6577600	6580920	Wasn't going to go there, but all right.
6580920	6583640	I said happy.
6583640	6585040	X-23 is in the game.
6585040	6586920	That makes me happy.
6586920	6592200	As in the chick clone of Wolverine, who's actually kind of awesome.
6592200	6593200	And hot?
6593200	6595400	Dark Sakura hot?
6595400	6597480	I guess if you like.
6597480	6599200	So then you would be a little horny.
6599200	6600200	I'm just kidding.
6600200	6603000	I would bite my butt, Rob.
6603000	6607660	And of course, you know, we also have Tron Bon in there.
6607660	6613640	And also other characters announced for Street Fighter IV.
6613640	6616020	This is pretty cool, is Yun and Yang.
6616020	6618280	So pretty cool.
6618280	6619280	From Street Fighter III.
6619280	6621040	I think that's pretty cool.
6621040	6624480	They were fun to play.
6624480	6625480	And Chun-Li.
6625480	6627680	I do not like Chun-Li.
6627680	6631960	She's in every fucking Street Fighter game except the very first one.
6631960	6634400	Fighting Street.
6634400	6642280	And then IGN found a game breaking bug in a certain game that we like to complain about
6642280	6643280	sometimes.
6643280	6646240	Even though I don't think any of us in here have played it.
6646240	6650440	Metroid Other M. I just know it's crap.
6650440	6651440	3D Metroid.
6651440	6653400	I'm not passing judgment until I play it.
6653400	6657200	And Rice Princess doesn't like any of the 3D Metroid games.
6657200	6658200	So she's biased.
6658200	6661920	I also don't like horseless carriages and metal birds.
6661920	6664440	Who are you?
6664440	6671280	At any rate, the bug, if you are in Sector 3 and a certain door stays locked, you'll
6671280	6672720	be locked there forever.
6672720	6673720	You're just stuck.
6673720	6678420	You're kind of like there being no boss at level 30.
6678420	6683820	And Nintendo did confirm it and they said that right now the only solutions are to load
6683820	6687640	an earlier save or start over from the beginning.
6687640	6689120	What a solution.
6689120	6692120	They haven't said anything about fixing it.
6692120	6695480	They're like, duh stupid, just restart the game.
6695480	6696480	That also happened in the...
6696480	6699280	And the best part is they can't fix it because the Wii doesn't patch games.
6699280	6701600	No, but that also happened in...
6701600	6705600	There's a potential that they can patch it through a firmware update.
6705600	6706600	Oh, interesting.
6706600	6707600	They can't.
6707600	6708600	Poop.
6708600	6709600	Oh yeah.
6709600	6710600	Poop.
6710600	6711600	Well, and good news.
6711600	6712600	Good happy news.
6712600	6713600	Where's my...
6713600	6714600	What are you gonna do?
6714600	6715600	Rob.
6715600	6716600	What?
6716600	6717600	Hi.
6717600	6718600	Fanfare.
6718600	6719600	I don't have a fanfare.
6719600	6720600	Hold on.
6720600	6721600	Well then sing it.
6721600	6722600	Poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.
6722600	6723600	Thank you, Irene.
6723600	6724600	Okay.
6724600	6725600	You're welcome.
6725600	6726600	Why don't I?
6726600	6727600	I'm getting your fanfare music.
6727600	6728600	But we already did it, Rob.
6728600	6729600	We're done.
6729600	6730600	You don't need to do it anymore.
6730600	6731600	It has the stamp of Irene on it.
6731600	6732600	Yes.
6732600	6733600	Hold on.
6733600	6734600	Okay, here's your fanfare.
6734600	6740600	I knew it.
6740600	6743880	One of the best shooting games ever.
6743880	6744880	And it's Tres-Ar goodness.
6744880	6748680	And I have to say it's Tres-Ar, because it's treasure.
6748680	6757860	Iridion Silver Gun, yay, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, yay.
6757860	6762080	And it'll be out in 2011, exclusively on Xbox Live Arcade.
6762080	6766600	It will have updated graphics, online co-op, and an Ikaruga mode.
6766600	6767600	Ikaruga?
6767600	6768600	Oh my.
6768600	6773540	And then that means that I don't have to spend $400 to play it at home.
6773540	6775920	Just some Microsoft points.
6775920	6777340	That's always good.
6777340	6783800	The last time I played Ikaruga was on an arcade machine in Las Vegas.
6783800	6784800	Wow.
6784800	6786400	So that was a long time ago.
6786400	6790720	The last time I played Ikaruga was one of the boss fights in Tournament of the Champions.
6790720	6791720	Not Ikaruga.
6791720	6792720	Radiant Silver Gun.
6792720	6795000	Last time I played Radiant Silver Gun.
6795000	6796160	Oh, okay.
6796160	6799360	And I touched a Saturn copy at California Extreme.
6799360	6800360	It was pretty.
6800360	6801360	It was expensive.
6801360	6802480	They wanted like $600 for it.
6802480	6804360	No, that's California Extreme!
6804360	6805360	Extreme!
6805360	6807360	Thank you, Eddie.
6807360	6808360	Extremely nerdy.
6808360	6810360	It was awesome.
6810360	6815080	So Radiant Silver Gun, Dan, we're getting this!
6815080	6816080	He's so excited.
6816080	6817680	How about Twitter topics?
6817680	6818680	No.
6818680	6819680	Okay.
6819680	6825000	Uh, every week we read your tweets at Twitter.com slash OLR, and I forgot to ask for them tonight,
6825000	6828680	so we have very few from tweeters who remember that we do this every week.
6828680	6829680	Rob, fail.
6829680	6830680	That's all right, we'll do it with you.
6830680	6833640	Well, if you want, if you wanted to get in a tweet and you forgot, you could hurry up
6833640	6836520	and send an email, because I don't think Dark Saga's opened the mailbag yet, so you can
6836520	6837520	hurry.
6837520	6838520	Yes.
6838520	6839520	Dope.
6839520	6840520	All right, uh, let's see.
6840520	6842960	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6842960	6844440	Pot Culture sent a tweet.
6844440	6847560	It actually isn't really directly related to the show, but I thought it was interesting.
6847560	6850680	He says, sorry gang, not gonna make the live feed tonight, playing a bit of Phantasy Star
6850680	6852540	Portable 2 then calling it a night.
6852540	6855960	By the way, code required for online multiplayer in PSP 2.
6855960	6860200	Now it looks like Sega's jumped on board with that whole thing.
6860200	6861200	Yay.
6861200	6866560	Blue Swim sends us a tweet with a story about Microsoft believes that Kinect will blow away
6866560	6868000	iPad sales.
6868000	6869000	What?
6869000	6871680	Good luck with that.
6871680	6873760	Totally unrelated product comparison.
6873760	6875800	I know, right?
6875800	6876800	Seriously?
6876800	6878800	I don't see how that's gonna work.
6878800	6880040	Christmas gifts, maybe?
6880040	6881040	I don't know.
6881040	6888160	Well, I could see that because, you know, the Kinect is only 150 bucks.
6888160	6896520	The comments coming from Kudosunoda of Microsoft saying this, quote, the preorders have been
6896520	6897680	really strong.
6897680	6901000	As far as what we're looking at for holiday, this is going to be stuff that'll blow away
6901000	6903160	any of the sales you've seen with the iPad.
6903160	6905360	This is in a remarks to Gamasutra.
6905360	6909280	The Xbox 360 is already selling better than the Wii and Sony right now.
6909280	6912800	Kinect's really just going to boost that to a whole new level.
6912800	6916120	And my television will outsell my car.
6916120	6918240	I think that they're comparing numbers.
6918240	6921260	I think all they're doing is comparing numbers.
6921260	6926120	And then Aaron Greenberg joins in saying, quote, we believe this will be the biggest
6926120	6928360	launch in our history for Xbox.
6928360	6935040	We will sell more Kinect sensors than we did systems at Xbox 360 launch and like such as
6935040	6936920	in the maps and the Iraq.
6936920	6938400	Here's kind of a side related question.
6938400	6942520	Do you guys think that Xbox actually is not planning on another system in the next couple
6942520	6943520	of years?
6943520	6948440	Let me get to that a minute, but first, A, they're going to sell more Kinects than Xbox
6948440	6952760	360s at launch because there weren't any fucking Xbox 360s available at launch.
6952760	6953760	Remember?
6953760	6954760	Never forget.
6954760	6958200	There was like no 360s anywhere for like six months.
6958200	6960160	They were in very limited supplies.
6960160	6962280	I see what you're doing there, you little...
6962280	6963280	Liar.
6963280	6964280	Yep.
6964280	6965280	All right.
6965280	6966840	Now, what was the other question?
6966840	6967840	I'm sorry.
6967840	6971200	Well, they've kind of alluded to this is they're not coming out with a new system for a while.
6971200	6974280	I'm wondering if that's just a bunch of crap.
6974280	6975440	Actually, I believe it.
6975440	6979160	I think the gap is going to be a little longer than you've seen in years past.
6979160	6983160	I think though the seal is going to get broken probably in the next couple of years.
6983160	6986280	I think Nintendo will be the first to do it, but next year they're going to be riding the
6986280	6990360	wave of the 3DS, but I think maybe the year after that they're going to name the Wii successor
6990360	6993740	and I think that'll kind of be the first in a wave.
6993740	6996680	Probably Microsoft at about two years will announce their successor too.
6996680	7001160	I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of updates to current consoles going on is
7001160	7004960	because A, it's all about the digital distribution and upgrades.
7004960	7011360	B, it's because of the economy and people don't have $400, $500, $600 to jump on a brand
7011360	7012880	new system.
7012880	7014600	I know what they're going to release next.
7014600	7015600	Uh-oh.
7015600	7016600	What?
7016600	7021080	They're going to release the Xbox 360 that doesn't get the red ring of death.
7021080	7023280	That'll be their new console.
7023280	7028760	Technically, they did release that new Xbox 360, don't call it a slim, but the slimmer
7028760	7029760	360.
7029760	7030760	Uh-huh.
7030760	7031760	That's out now.
7031760	7032760	More breakable.
7032760	7033760	No, it can't red ring because it doesn't have rings.
7033760	7034760	Oh.
7034760	7035760	Clever.
7035760	7036760	Well played, Microsoft.
7036760	7037760	I'm onto you, though.
7037760	7046960	No, it also has its senses and if the internal parts are getting too hot, which causes that,
7046960	7049640	it actually shuts the system down before it will red ring.
7049640	7050640	Wait, wait.
7050640	7051640	Oh, wonderful.
7051640	7053520	That's the worst solution ever.
7053520	7056320	Oh, man.
7056320	7059320	Or as Frisbee in chat calls it, the Xbox 360.
7059320	7062360	Oh, guffaw, guffaw, guffaw.
7062360	7065800	Oh, good one.
7065800	7066960	Here's the thing, though.
7066960	7070520	Don't be too excited for the next consoles because I'm going to tell you, especially
7070520	7075560	probably from Sony's camp, the next series of consoles, one of them's going to get ballsy
7075560	7077560	and it'll probably be Sony.
7077560	7079120	Totally digital distribution.
7079120	7080120	Just wait.
7080120	7081120	Okay.
7081120	7082120	It's a digital distribution.
7082120	7084640	Then the games better be cheaper.
7084640	7087640	They won't.
7087640	7088640	I don't care.
7088640	7090360	Hey, we've got more tweets from Tiger Claw.
7090360	7091360	A what?
7091360	7096360	Hi, Tiger Claw.
7096360	7101160	I'm looking at Matt over here and he's got the mic rested on his chin and he's working
7101160	7104680	on his iPad touch, so it's multitasking over here.
7104680	7105680	Anyhow.
7105680	7110160	I'm playing Plants vs. Zombies.
7110160	7116160	Tiger Claw and Link, speaking of Apple and apps and stuff, they rejected the Onions shoot
7116160	7118800	people point blank in the face game.
7118800	7119800	What?
7119800	7120800	Why?
7120800	7121800	That's really too bad.
7121800	7124400	There's actually a little trailer here that you can watch.
7124400	7125400	Okay.
7125400	7126400	My fantasy.
7126400	7128400	Oh, this is a whole little, hold on, they're showing it at first.
7128400	7131120	We're about to have a photo of Loki playing.
7131120	7135880	But apparently the Onion wrote about a fictional first person shooter.
7135880	7140120	It's called Close Range and you just repeatedly shoot people and animals point blank in the
7140120	7141120	face.
7141120	7145720	Wait, that's a game?
7145720	7148880	You mean that's not every first person shooter?
7148880	7153000	Video game fans are lining up today to be the first to purchase Close Range.
7153000	7157180	The hotly anticipated video game in which players repeatedly shoot people point blank
7157180	7158180	in the face.
7158180	7162400	Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.
7162400	7163400	Thanks Bobby.
7163400	7167900	Close Range is already being hailed by critics as the most important game of the year.
7167900	7172320	The first person shooter creates an immersive richly detailed world where players shoot
7172320	7173960	people in the face with guns.
7173960	7176840	Reviewers say it brings a new level of depth to gaming.
7176840	7180600	Just like great literature film transports you to different worlds, Close Range transports
7180600	7183640	you to a world where you fire bullets into an endless stream of faces.
7183640	7189320	Fans say it's the game's well developed characters and storyline that make Close Range so compelling.
7189320	7192920	You just feel like you're inside this complex character who's thrust into a world where
7192920	7194320	he has to blow people's heads off.
7194320	7199440	The plot follows AJ, a man with a mysterious past who must explode hundreds of thousands
7199440	7203060	of human faces on a quest to save his kidnapped brother.
7203060	7204680	Who are you?
7204680	7206760	Someone who can help.
7206760	7208600	I know where your brother is.
7208600	7209600	Tell me.
7209600	7210600	Look out!
7210600	7214100	But Close Range's single player story is just the beginning.
7214100	7219340	Its outstanding multiplayer mode offers unparalleled interactivity by allowing players to blast
7219340	7220760	each other's faces off.
7220760	7221960	It's completely open-ended.
7221960	7225240	You can shoot someone in the ear, but you can also shoot them in the eye.
7225240	7228880	With hundreds of hidden extras like side missions where players can take a break from shooting
7228880	7233440	people in the face to shoot animals in the face, Close Range will keep players from floating
7233440	7234440	in the face.
7234440	7239520	And with the sequel, Close Range 2 Chainsaw Dawn continuing the epic story next fall,
7239520	7242800	Close Range fans have even more to look forward to.
7242800	7244960	For the Onion News Network, I'm Geoff Tate.
7244960	7245960	Thanks Geoff.
7245960	7246960	Wow.
7246960	7248400	That was pretty amazing.
7248400	7252800	And I know that probably made for horrible radio, but they really did show, they really
7252800	7258120	did show people like shooting at Close Range face, and then there was a horse and an ostrich.
7258120	7261840	I just, I don't see the difference, isn't that every first person shooter game?
7261840	7263280	Ga-faw, ga-faw, ga-faw.
7263280	7268920	Anyhow, the Onion actually made it a game and submitted Close Range to sell on the App
7268920	7270040	Store.
7270040	7273200	But Apple, I would have bought it, shit.
7273200	7275360	But you know Loki's looking it up right now.
7275360	7277600	No, I already saw that news report.
7277600	7279440	We'll check the jailbreak for us.
7279440	7282400	Apple rejected it due to violence.
7282400	7287960	However, they have, the Onion has revised the game and resubmitted it.
7287960	7289480	But good luck.
7289480	7295400	The iPad and iPhone App Stores prohibits apps portraying realistic images of people or animals
7295400	7298240	being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured or injured.
7298240	7300360	That didn't look really realistic.
7300360	7302920	That's awesome.
7302920	7307640	They must be on lots of crack to have that be their idea of realism.
7307640	7313420	Hey, also from Tiger Claw, I know he wants us to know that the SingStar Dance Track List
7313420	7314420	is out.
7314420	7318140	That's right, because now, with thanks to the PlayStation Move, not only do you get
7318140	7320920	to sing, but you get to dance in SingStar.
7320920	7321920	Yay.
7321920	7325040	Irene's really excited for my next SingStar party, aren't you?
7325040	7326040	Totally.
7326040	7327040	I can't wait.
7327040	7330440	Well, here's some of the hits you can do in this new game for SingStar Dance.
7330440	7336880	In Sync, Bye Bye Bye, Blondie, Heart of Glass, Cyndi Lauper, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Gwen
7336880	7341720	Stefani, Whatchu Waitin' For?, Casey and the Sunshine Band, That's the Way I Like It, La
7341720	7343600	Rue with Bulletproof.
7343600	7344600	That's a popular one.
7344600	7349920	Lady Gaga with Poker Face, New Kids on the Block with Hangin' Tough, Paula Abdul was
7349920	7357000	Straight Up, Real Too Real with I Like to Move It, The Backstreet Boys with Everybody
7357000	7363120	Backstreet's Back, and Irene's personal favorite, The Black Eyed Peas with Shut Up.
7363120	7364720	Shut Up!
7364720	7365720	Nuh-uh.
7365720	7366720	Great.
7366720	7369220	That's awesome.
7369220	7371720	I'm pre-ordering that game right?
7371720	7372720	Never.
7372720	7373720	Alright.
7373720	7375600	That's it for the Twitter topic.
7375600	7377880	Sorry to those folks that didn't get their tweets read.
7377880	7380880	You'll just have to tweet us a little faster next time, won't you?
7380880	7381880	Back to some gaming news.
7381880	7386440	Loki, I hate to tear you away from Plants vs. Zombies, but I'm thinking you might want
7386440	7387840	to read some stories for our listeners.
7387840	7388840	Sure, why not.
7388840	7390800	Or we can just watch more Onion videos all night.
7390800	7391800	Onion Lounge Radio, really.
7391800	7392800	You know, whatever.
7392800	7393800	It's better.
7393800	7399200	Uh, EA apparently has not received significant backlash to their online pass.
7399200	7404000	Remember, the online pass is part of their Project 10 dollars, which is the dumbest name
7404000	7410880	for a project ever, and it charges 10 dollars for access to online games, or online modes
7410880	7413640	in games, if you purchase the game used.
7413640	7418600	It says, people know that bandwidth isn't free, so the fact that we are diffusing online
7418600	7423880	costs isn't seen as unreasonable.
7423880	7427600	That makes no sense, I'll just say.
7427600	7429860	In other words, people aren't complaining enough.
7429860	7430860	So complain more.
7430860	7431860	That's a dumb excuse.
7431860	7434520	They're all, oh, bandwidth's not free.
7434520	7436360	Well, here's the thing.
7436360	7439600	They say it just like that, too, bandwidth's not free.
7439600	7443800	No, they say it more like this, bandwidth's not free!
7443800	7446560	Well, here's the problem, though.
7446560	7448400	People bought the game new to begin with.
7448400	7454920	So if, say, I bought a game for 60 dollars, and then sold it to Rob, or, you know, sold
7454920	7459400	it back to GameStop, and then Rob bought a used copy, okay, there's still the same amount
7459400	7461800	of people playing online, potentially.
7461800	7469040	But, you see, they were robbed of the 60 dollar new game that that person might have potentially
7469040	7470040	bought.
7470040	7471900	It's still the same amount of people playing online.
7471900	7475640	They wouldn't have bought because it's 60 dollars, they buy used games because they're
7475640	7479400	cheaper, and they probably would have just pirated it.
7479400	7484860	Do I have to go down to their fucking offices with a basket of apples and show them, okay,
7484860	7489720	if I give you an apple, or, okay, how many apples do you have?
7489720	7490720	You have one apple?
7490720	7491720	Okay.
7491720	7495640	Say you sell the apple used back to GameStop, you have now zero apples.
7495640	7498680	I don't think GameStop buys apples.
7498680	7499680	It doesn't matter, okay?
7499680	7501320	Although I'd like to see you try.
7501320	7502320	Okay, so.
7502320	7505320	Yes, I'd like to sell back this apple.
7505320	7509520	Um, sir, we don't buy apples.
7509520	7515720	So, EA, I purchased this apple from you, okay, for 60 dollars.
7515720	7518200	You have my 60 dollars, okay?
7518200	7522560	I take this apple and give it to my friend, Rob, okay?
7522560	7526700	Rob has not paid you 60 dollars, but he'll be using this apple to play online.
7526700	7531720	I will no longer be playing online with this apple because I don't have an apple anymore.
7531720	7533520	How many people are playing online with this apple?
7533520	7536760	Wait, wait, wait, but you said you brought a basket of apples, so you actually have like
7536760	7538760	20 more apples sitting in the basket.
7538760	7541680	Exactly, and I've paid for all those copies of the games, Brandon.
7541680	7543760	I want to see these amazing online apples.
7543760	7546720	I'm just gonna go online and download the apple for free.
7546720	7549200	That's what I'm gonna do.
7549200	7551680	It comes down to it, that's just a dumb excuse.
7551680	7560160	That would be like saying, um, oh, let's see here, Rob, um, you know, I went ahead and
7560160	7563760	made this nice dinner out of food that I purchased from the grocery store.
7563760	7567200	However, for you to eat that dinner, you're gonna have to pay that grocery store 10 dollars
7567200	7573760	because, you know, they lost out the sales of you purchasing food from the grocery store,
7573760	7579600	despite the fact that they still have the same amount of food in the grocery store,
7579600	7581600	you know, regardless.
7581600	7585120	They've lost no money.
7585120	7586480	I will not.
7586480	7588000	My voice must be heard.
7588000	7592720	The problem is they're not fighting, they're basically just, you know, saying, oh, well,
7592720	7597320	you know, bandwidth costs money, and gamers are like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
7597320	7603200	Instead of going, wait a second, I paid them for that bandwidth already.
7603200	7608900	Going to a chat room at chat.orangesontraday.com, Spassinator PSN says, that's like GM complaining
7608900	7611920	that a car dealership sells used cars.
7611920	7617320	Dark Tetsuya says, wow, I haven't heard Loki say Apple this much since his latest Mac rant.
7617320	7620800	Dark Tetsuya says, Apple Lounge Radio.
7620800	7631240	And lastly, Segg says, but I'm sure they sell lemons.
7631240	7636760	Here's my answer to why they haven't seen that much backlash yet as far as the online
7636760	7641600	passing goes, because not a lot of people buy EA Sports games used.
7641600	7645320	I'm guessing that most people buy them brand new when they first come out because they
7645320	7647520	have to have their EA Sports games.
7647520	7651200	And I'm sure that a lot of people that have bought EA Sports games are probably only buying
7651200	7658520	one or two EA Sports games, not everybody's buying Tiger, NCAA Football, Madden, NHL,
7658520	7662000	no one's buying everything.
7662000	7666040	So I'm going to guess that's probably why that no one's bitching about it, but I bet
7666040	7669720	you anything if this comes out a Medal of Honor or something like that and a bunch of
7669720	7675080	people are buying it used later on, there will be people bitching.
7675080	7680600	Xam in our chat room says, Apple's online, the latest fruit-based MMORPG following Fruit
7680600	7683720	Base Fantasy XI and Papaya Star Online.
7683720	7688360	But remember, see, if you don't speak up, then they're just going to assume that everything
7688360	7692320	is okay, so, you know, whatever.
7692320	7693320	We tried, we tried.
7693320	7696400	Of course, their sales aren't going to hurt at all because, you know, Madden's going to
7696400	7702080	be the top selling game, but like if you know EA, say, for example, puts out, I don't know,
7702080	7708800	an MMO version of, like, Littlest Pet Shop or something like that and charges $10 for
7708800	7712400	online, I'm sure a lot of people won't buy, well actually fuck that, no one's going to
7712400	7713400	buy that game anyways.
7713400	7715600	What am I talking about?
7715600	7717840	Little girls everywhere want that game.
7717840	7719680	No, they have Hello Kitty online.
7719680	7723000	Fine, you're right, EA, you should be charging more for online.
7723000	7725560	In fact, you should charge them $120.
7725560	7727000	Why stop at $10?
7727000	7728000	That's just ridiculous.
7728000	7729480	How about $10 a month?
7729480	7735280	In fact, I think you should charge them whatever year it is, so, you know, $2010, $2010 to
7735280	7737320	get online.
7737320	7738880	That sounds reasonable.
7738880	7744360	Hey, going over to the Kinect and Microsoft, some news about the whole camera scanning
7744360	7746120	feature that's going on there.
7746120	7751160	You remember when they first showed Kinect, in that whole little Milo demo, they showed
7751160	7755000	like, ooh, I'm going to draw Milo a picture and put it up on the camera and he's going
7755000	7756000	to, like, show me-
7756000	7759200	That's a wonderful penis you've drawn for me!
7759200	7761280	Pretty much was the demo they were showing, right?
7761280	7766280	But then when they actually showed the games you could play, it was all flail 2000 and
7766280	7768840	dance and wave my hands.
7768840	7773720	And there really was nothing about, oh, it reads paper or any of that stuff, right?
7773720	7774720	Well-
7774720	7779300	Have you, by the way, not the, this is still about Milo, have you seen the new Milo demo
7779300	7781200	video that they had out there?
7781200	7786120	It was, I forget what conference is being shown at, but it, and this isn't like a bad
7786120	7791240	joke or anything, they were actually showing it, apparently he's like moved to the US because
7791240	7794920	his family is having, they're conflicting or something like that.
7794920	7798520	But the thing is, is like you're outside, you're following him around and helping him
7798520	7802720	find snails and stuff like that and talking to this little kid and he has to like run
7802720	7804080	inside his house and stuff.
7804080	7808240	And to me it seems like kind of like a first person version of like some creepy pedophile
7808240	7811760	that's hiding in your yard, you know, talking to this little boy.
7811760	7812760	Pedobear of the game.
7812760	7815480	Seriously, it's Pedobear of the game.
7815480	7819240	Anyways, back to the scanning stuff.
7819240	7823080	Maybe now's not a good time to talk about Kinect Joyride, which is the game I was actually
7823080	7824080	going to talk about.
7824080	7827680	They were showing off a demo of this at Tokyo Game Show.
7827680	7832640	Big Park, the developers behind Joyride, which is a Microsoft owned studio, they actually
7832640	7835640	have worked in some of the camera capture into this game.
7835640	7840400	Here's the weird thing, what it does, when you do your vehicle customization options,
7840400	7842140	you can pick your car's color.
7842140	7846960	But if you don't like the colors in the game, Kinect will look at an item that you put in
7846960	7851560	front of the camera and put its color on the car.
7851560	7857640	So how long until a car that is colored the same color as someone's penis?
7857640	7859640	That's what I want to know.
7859640	7864800	That's really cool.
7864800	7867600	That's the wonders of modern technology.
7867600	7869600	It matches colors.
7869600	7871600	Good job.
7871600	7872600	Cocky.
7872600	7880880	By the way, you could also capture textures and that whole thing in LittleBigPlanet.
7880880	7885480	Also by the way, last year or two years ago, I would already read pictures in front of
7885480	7887000	the Playstation Eye.
7887000	7890280	This actually isn't anything new, just so you know.
7890280	7891280	Thanks Rob.
7891280	7892280	You're welcome.
7892280	7893280	Dark Sakura!
7893280	7895800	We have something that's a little bit more fun than that.
7895800	7899760	You can hack your shoes into Wiimotes.
7899760	7905000	Basically this guy named Nick Marsh hacked his Nike shoes, they specifically say Nike,
7905000	7911260	ooh, to make Wii controllers as part of the Nike 78 project, where they asked 78 artists
7911260	7914000	to be creative with their shoes.
7914000	7920040	So what it does is actually it changes the way a lot of these games are played.
7920040	7930040	I think that he's using Wii Sports or one of these balance board games and using a chair
7930040	7934080	so he's jumping up and down for doing the little dance thing.
7934080	7938960	And then, but it looks like he can actually do the running and play stuff.
7938960	7943280	It looks like he's having an epileptic seizure, like I'm sorry.
7943280	7947120	I'm just waiting for that dog in that one video to come out and push the chair before
7947120	7948120	he sits down.
7948120	7950520	When he falls on his ass, have you guys seen this video?
7950520	7951520	It's great.
7951520	7957440	But I mean, it looks like though it totally adds a lot more of a different dimension to
7957440	7958440	the game.
7958440	7959440	I mean, like it could be more active.
7959440	7961440	Oh, it's Wii Boxing.
7961440	7962920	Oh, is that what it is?
7962920	7964560	Well, no, he's doing Wii Aerobics or something.
7964560	7965560	No, he's doing the dancing, whatever.
7965560	7966560	The dancing one.
7966560	7967560	On stage.
7967560	7971480	It looks like somebody is like shooting bullets at his feet.
7971480	7972480	That's what it looks like.
7972480	7974240	I think it's neat though.
7974240	7975240	I think it's really cool.
7975240	7976240	I'm a maniac, maniac.
7976240	7978520	That's what it looks like.
7978520	7983120	Yeah, I guess if you want to look more ridiculous doing stuff on the Wii, yeah.
7983120	7987400	But I mean, when he wasn't using the chair, it did look like he was actually kind of dancing
7987400	7990960	along with the people on the screen instead of just using the balance board, you know?
7990960	7993080	It looked like it would be fun.
7993080	7996840	It was just weird that he had to keep sitting on that chair, but you know, whatever.
7996840	7998080	It's like using the bar in DDR.
7998080	8000320	Not going to judge, not going to judge.
8000320	8004000	Mailbag and the FUs of the Wii coming up after just a couple more stories.
8004000	8005000	Loki.
8005000	8006000	Yes.
8006000	8011600	And apparently there's a new game coming out called Shadows of the Damned.
8011600	8013800	You said a bad word.
8013800	8017160	Yes I did.
8017160	8025120	Apparently this is the long awaited collaboration of Suda51, Akami, and EA.
8025120	8031200	And of course this new game is going to be a psychological action thriller.
8031200	8032200	And he said-
8032200	8035160	There's some Shadows of the Damned going on in the next room, right?
8035160	8040600	According to Suda, he said he and Akami wanted to make this game for a long time.
8040600	8043360	He searched for the right publisher to bring it to the audience.
8043360	8046600	Finally, they said that they can reveal the game they've been working on together with
8046600	8047600	EA.
8047600	8050760	It's expected to release in 2011.
8050760	8053680	And yeah, it's pretty cool.
8053680	8057840	I know he was working on another game also, which is kind of cool.
8057840	8061080	And I believe Akira Yomoka is doing music for that one.
8061080	8062080	So that's pretty sweet.
8062080	8063080	What?
8063080	8068240	Yeah, well Akira Yomoka left Konami and he's supposedly partnering with EA now, so this
8068240	8069240	makes sense.
8069240	8070240	Bravo!
8070240	8071240	Akira Yomoka.
8071240	8073880	This is going to be a heck of a game, but we don't know anything but a title, right?
8073880	8075320	Nothing right now, yeah.
8075320	8076320	Not even a screenshot.
8076320	8077320	Nothing.
8077320	8078320	Nothing.
8078320	8081560	It's going to be all like stick figures and psychological action.
8081560	8084160	It'll probably be a big thing at E3 next year, I'm imagining.
8084160	8087100	Oh, like Shattered Memories was?
8087100	8089160	That was a psychological thriller.
8089160	8091400	But that also was a different developer.
8091400	8093120	It wasn't an EA game.
8093120	8094520	I know, it was shit.
8094520	8095520	I heard.
8095520	8097960	I heard your strong feelings about this earlier.
8097960	8102480	Speaking of things that Irene is a big fan of, it was officially announced this week
8102480	8107440	through Mila Jovovich that another Resident Evil movie is definitely coming.
8107440	8108440	What do you mean?
8108440	8110200	With that like open ending?
8110200	8111200	No!
8111200	8113640	Surely you just.
8113640	8118000	Quote Mila Jovovich in the New York magazine, quote, this new Resident Evil is the first
8118000	8120800	one to ever open at number one worldwide.
8120800	8122640	It's the biggest movie in the franchise.
8122640	8125400	So we're definitely going to make another one.
8125400	8131380	She's also asking fans to send suggestions for the next film to her Twitter page.
8131380	8137300	So if you want to tweet her and tell her some ideas, like make a movie that doesn't suck,
8137300	8142480	you could tweet her at M-I-L-L-A J-O-V-O-V-I-C-H.
8142480	8145200	Because you don't know how to spell it.
8145200	8146200	Alright.
8146200	8149840	Suggestion, do not make another movie.
8149840	8151800	Thank you.
8151800	8154640	You need to get a Twitter account just to tweet that to her.
8154640	8156320	I liked the last ones, honestly.
8156320	8158720	I haven't seen the very last one, but I want to.
8158720	8160840	Yeah, I didn't mind the first three movies.
8160840	8165440	The third one was kind of, but this one was just pretty horrible.
8165440	8170040	Speaking of Resident Evil movies, there's going to be another CG Resident Evil movie
8170040	8172720	called Damnation.
8172720	8179120	It's going to be released in Japan in 2012 and I guess it's 3D.
8179120	8184880	Z-Generation has shipped over 1.6 million copies for home viewing and it only had a
8184880	8189840	very limited release in Japan in the theaters and it grossed about $480,000 which is really
8189840	8190840	good.
8190840	8192400	40 million yen if you want to be technical.
8192400	8196900	So there you go, another CG Resident Evil movie coming called Damnation and that's probably
8196900	8201400	what Irene is going to say again if she has to see it in 3D.
8201400	8202400	Pretty much.
8202400	8204360	Are we ready to get to the mailbag?
8204360	8205560	Let's do it, Rob.
8205560	8210160	Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelauntraded.com is the place to send
8210160	8211160	them to.
8211160	8215760	We open up the mailbag and find a few of our favorites and read them live on air and Dark
8215760	8217760	Soccer will make fun of your grammar.
8217760	8219520	Yes I will.
8219520	8222480	Okay, this comes from Rini.
8222480	8224280	Hi Rini!
8224280	8225280	Greetings O.L.R.
8225280	8230260	On episode 8, I'm sorry 381, you lamented over Guitar Hero Warrior of Rock's ability
8230260	8232520	to post accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook.
8232520	8233520	We did?
8233520	8234520	Oh.
8234520	8238840	I didn't mention Rock Band 3 also has media integration features, but they have a bit
8238840	8239840	of use.
8239840	8243400	For example, you can make a setlist and post it for friends to see or try out.
8243400	8246120	Of course you can throttle the frequency of posts.
8246120	8250980	Another concern with Rock Band 3 is promo DLC, which is going to be separate from standard
8250980	8252080	DLC.
8252080	8255160	Just to clarify, this pro DLC is only for guitar and bass.
8255160	8258160	Pro keys and drums are included in the normal DLC.
8258160	8263240	There's a lot more interesting details I could just gloss over, but rather than tired poor
8263240	8267320	Dark Soccer's windpipes, I'll just link you guys to a few sources to skim over interesting
8267320	8272000	details if you want to bring up such as harmonics, making older DLC compatible with keys in pro
8272000	8273000	mode.
8273000	8274000	So yeah, different stuff.
8274000	8275520	All stuff coming out of packs.
8275520	8280760	I am really excited, I actually did not pick up on the fact that pro keys was going to
8280760	8281760	be just included.
8281760	8283760	That actually makes me really happy.
8283760	8285760	I'm smiling.
8285760	8290000	You just can't see it because it's radio, but I'm smiling.
8290000	8293840	Next email, Hey Orange Dones Radio, Haseo Sumi-Ragawa, here for the third time in this
8293840	8294840	Lovely Marathon episode.
8294840	8295840	So this was, yeah, last week.
8295840	8297360	This must be an old one.
8297360	8301520	Okay, in an earlier episode I asked about a problem with downloading Bleach Heat The
8301520	8302800	Soul 6.
8302800	8305720	And you guys said be more detailed, so here it is.
8305720	8308560	Okay, Bleach Heat The Soul 6 is a PSP game.
8308560	8311360	I downloaded it and it was a RAR file.
8311360	8316240	Oh, you downloaded a fake.
8316240	8321880	Can't help him with that unless he gets into something a little more legitimate.
8321880	8326480	I don't want to pay the extra cost of importing at $60, which is a bit ridiculous considering
8326480	8330640	the extra $20 for next day shipping so they can kiss my butt on that front.
8330640	8331640	Actually...
8331640	8335440	You can buy, by the way, import PSP games at Fry's.
8335440	8339520	I actually, I'm going to take shit for this, but I don't care.
8339520	8340520	I've said it on the show before.
8340520	8343880	I'm not opposed to pirating importing games, imported games actually.
8343880	8347760	Because I think if they are not going to take a chance and release it over here, then why
8347760	8352380	should we pay all this money in import fees to when they're not counting on us for their
8352380	8353380	success anyway?
8353380	8354380	You know what I mean?
8354380	8359960	Like, I know that's going to be frowned upon by some people, but I really don't pirate
8359960	8364080	games here in the US, but the import ones, yeah, I have.
8364080	8367560	Thanks for reading my email, loyal listener Samir Agala.
8367560	8372440	PS, people are wondering, I got the name from Haseo from.hack//G.U. series.
8372440	8376080	Samir Agala from the ReadOrDieTV anime, yes, I know it's a woman's last name, it doesn't
8376080	8379800	really matter whose last name it is, but F you to all who have a problem with that.
8379800	8380800	Thanks again.
8380800	8386520	Also, if you can't help me via the radio, please do send a reply.
8386520	8387520	Forward it to Loki.
8387520	8391520	Loki can trick the mailbox.
8391520	8398000	Okay, now, okay, this is from Robboy, from Robaba.
8398000	8401800	Now wait a minute, with all the halos and modern, no, more violence drops impossible.
8401800	8403600	Okay, that's what it's called.
8403600	8407200	Now wait a minute, with all the halos and modern warfares, crimes should be way up according
8407200	8409720	to the whack job anti-game protesters, right?
8409720	8412480	Not so in, and there's an article from Bennington Banner.
8412480	8416680	The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report Monday on crime statistics for 2009
8416680	8423880	that showed a 5.3% drop in violent crimes nationwide and a 4.6% drop in property crimes.
8423880	8428280	I'll be honest that they didn't define the drop context, whether it's per capita or total
8428280	8432840	crimes, but all of these violent games poisoning our minds should turn us into gun-toting cold-blooded
8432840	8433840	killers.
8433840	8437560	I personally believe that not just games, but media and software use in general may
8437560	8440760	be indirectly causing the drop.
8440760	8445600	Watching TV, playing games, browsing the intertubes, texting on our phones, and other sedentary
8445600	8448160	activities are keeping us inside.
8448160	8451760	Not just that, and here's where I get a little controversial, I believe that violence is
8451760	8455600	inversely correlated with average weight.
8455600	8459920	Think about it, the more you are overweight, the less mayhem you'll be willing to do.
8459920	8464880	Fat equals peace, maybe that's stretching it, or discrimination right there, or stretch
8464880	8469560	pantsing it.
8469560	8473720	Everyone slowly step away from Rob.
8473720	8478160	I'm trying to think if I've ever seen on the news, like somebody who committed a really
8478160	8483760	horrible crime and if they were fat, like I'm, I'm sure there's been a few fatties.
8483760	8486160	There's been.
8486160	8487160	You're the you in your plan.
8487160	8489360	The guy who shot John Lennon was pretty fat, if I remember right, so.
8489360	8490360	Oh yeah.
8490360	8492280	And that was a really recent story too, so.
8492280	8495400	And I was commenting on the fact that you're like seven pounds, Rob, I wasn't saying you're
8495400	8496400	fat, it was the opposite.
8496400	8497400	Slim Jim over here.
8497400	8498400	It's from Rob-a-ba.
8498400	8501160	Anyway, next email.
8501160	8504400	Okay, this is from somebody.
8504400	8509160	Hey guys, I've been listening to this show for a year now, my first episode being the
8509160	8510160	fuck show.
8510160	8513680	Anyways, I have something word to share with you.
8513680	8519480	The very day after you guys had Omen in the Cage match, DJ Hero posted a clip of it on
8519480	8520480	YouTube.
8520480	8521480	Coincidence?
8521480	8522880	I think not, XD.
8522880	8525880	But one more thing.
8525880	8530040	Is that song you use at the end of the show every weekend behind the but we're probably
8530040	8531040	right anyway message?
8531040	8532680	I can't find it anywhere, thanks.
8532680	8534200	That's just the closing time midi.
8534200	8536160	It's an 8-bit remix of closing time.
8536160	8539140	There was some website, I don't even know where it came from because it was actually
8539140	8542280	sent to me by a friend and I was like, hey, we'll make that the closing theme of our show.
8542280	8543760	And this is from Andy.
8543760	8548300	I believe some website did like a compilation of a bunch of 8-bit versions of songs.
8548300	8549960	You could probably find it on YouTube.
8549960	8553720	Just Google like YouTube 8-bit closing time, you'll find it.
8553720	8554720	But that's it.
8554720	8555720	And what was it?
8555720	8556720	There was another part of the question?
8556720	8557720	No.
8557720	8558720	Oh.
8558720	8559720	No.
8559720	8560720	Well, I made it through the whole marathon podcast.
8560720	8561720	Thanks for all the effort.
8561720	8564200	And as I think would be appropriate, here's the marathon email.
8564200	8567680	It's shorter than 11 hours though, so you can stop grimacing, you misspelled my name
8567680	8568680	dude.
8568680	8570420	I'm looking at you.
8570420	8573860	First of all, just to raise the bar, I thought I'd let you know that this week we're getting
8573860	8576580	a five, yes, five-day weekend in Mexico.
8576580	8581440	Since we're deep in bicentennial celebration, high five, act deaf, viva Mexico.
8581440	8586040	My best geek moment was definitely when both of my kids, six and eight, actually requested
8586040	8588320	I run a D&D campaign for them.
8588320	8591240	Now we're playing the Diceless Marvel RPG.
8591240	8595300	As for anger management moments, my one real fight with my mom was when I was growing up.
8595300	8599340	At 14, she came into my room and just turned off my SNES because she thought I had had
8599340	8600600	enough video games for the day.
8600600	8603780	Well, I thought differently and actually took her by the shoulders and proceeded to gently
8603780	8607840	but firmly explain as I took her out of my room, locked the door and turned my console
8607840	8608960	back on again.
8608960	8611280	She never bothered me with time limits after that.
8611280	8612280	Wow.
8612280	8613280	Wow.
8613280	8618320	Finally, I've done the math and considering my OLR cherry was popped somewhere in the
8618320	8619320	to-go era.
8619320	8621760	Is this guy skinny?
8621760	8622760	Let me finish.
8622760	8623760	All right.
8623760	8624760	Episode number now forgotten.
8624760	8628360	I'm not listed in the wiki, but it was the one where Rob came out of the closet for the
8628360	8629720	audience.
8629720	8638040	I've now listened to at least episode one.
8638040	8639360	Not the gaydar Rob.
8639360	8644420	Just actually saying it actually might have been a while because I think at the beginning
8644420	8649000	of the show, I actually purposely didn't want to say anything because not that I was ashamed
8649000	8650000	of it.
8650000	8653000	I'm certainly not, but it's just kind of one of those, like, I was like, it's not your
8653000	8654000	business.
8654000	8655000	It doesn't matter for a while.
8655000	8658440	I had a change of heart and well to finish this email.
8658440	8659440	Sorry.
8659440	8666600	I've now listened to at least 245 episodes or if you prefer 621.5 hours, 2.5 hours a
8666600	8668280	pop of OLR.
8668280	8670640	That's over 25 days of entertainment from you.
8670640	8674320	So I'll just go ahead and thank you for one of the best months of my life and call it
8674320	8676440	even for the next few episodes.
8676440	8677440	Okay.
8677440	8678440	Gracias.
8678440	8679440	Muchas gracias.
8679440	8683080	Sincerely, Dr. Noir, AKA the other Mexican recruit.
8683080	8687680	PS, this mail has been reviewed by two separate automated spelling and grammar sensors and
8687680	8691560	proofread by two young goats, which were then sacrificed to the bard in order to keep the
8691560	8692960	dark goddess appeased.
8692960	8697280	For the record, my name is spelled J-A-M-I-E, but thank you for trying.
8697280	8699320	You know, it's funny.
8699320	8701120	And people in other countries get a bye.
8701120	8702120	Yes.
8702120	8703120	Yes they do.
8703120	8704520	But I have to tell you this.
8704520	8711320	My name was never, my first name was never misspelled until I moved to California.
8711320	8712320	Interesting.
8712320	8716480	I'm just saying, people in Alabama can spell my name right.
8716480	8720120	Next email.
8720120	8722040	And this is another one from Rababa.
8722040	8724880	I got what I believe can only be a phishing scam.
8724880	8730860	I get an email from spoofed Blizzard inviting me to a beta of the next WoW expansion.
8730860	8734460	The link is probably to a fake WoW login server because it didn't actually start with a Blizzard
8734460	8736200	or WoW address.
8736200	8739160	Also I don't even have a WoW account which made it extra fishy.
8739160	8740680	PSA complete.
8740680	8747280	I also got to play Dark Sakura Sunday because I got nauseous playing TrackMania.
8747280	8748280	Later Rababa.
8748280	8750200	No, it sounds legit to me.
8750200	8751560	Yeah, you know what's funny?
8751560	8753920	I get emails all the time for Ion online.
8753920	8758560	Like, you know, log in and get free gold for Ion online and I'm like, I don't even play
8758560	8759560	dude.
8759560	8761960	It's like, I don't have an account but okay, I'm gonna go do it right now.
8761960	8765000	By the way, I have to tell you what Tiara said.
8765000	8767320	If you've got import problems, Rob Bill's bad for you son.
8767320	8769920	He's got 99 problems but a pirate ain't one.
8769920	8773560	Oh, a happy talk like a pirate day to you too.
8773560	8774560	Arr.
8774560	8775560	Arr.
8775560	8776560	Arr.
8776560	8777560	Arr.
8777560	8778560	Arr.
8778560	8779560	Arr.
8779560	8780560	Arr.
8780560	8781560	Uh, yeah.
8781560	8782560	Derailed.
8782560	8783560	Keelhaul.
8783560	8784560	Next email.
8784560	8785560	That's it.
8785560	8790680	Oh, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.
8790680	8792320	The futures!
8792320	8803720	But the present brings the angst and the FUs of the week.
8803720	8824480	Here is justice, here is punishment, here is the fog of the day.
8824480	8825480	Darkstalker.
8825480	8826480	Um, FU to, um, Algebra.
8826480	8827480	Loki.
8827480	8828480	Second back.
8828480	8829480	Um, I'd say FU to, um, well actually I've got quite a few this week.
8829480	8832680	Um, FU to Ford for making really shitty cars.
8832680	8839200	I've had to replace, um, the, uh, thermostat housing on my car about three times now because
8839200	8844800	it keeps breaking, because it's made of plastic, and because it gets cracks in it because it
8844800	8847760	oxidizes and that sucks.
8847760	8849720	And it's about $300 each time.
8849720	8855680	So FU to that, um, FU to people that, while they're grocery shopping, aren't paying attention
8855680	8860120	to where the hell they are and they're totally blocking the aisle, they have their cart on
8860120	8864160	one side and they're just browsing, totally oblivious to the world on the other side,
8864160	8869400	or they have, like, kids running around and stuff like that, you know, so FU to them.
8869400	8877160	And people that like to, um, I guess participate in idle chit-chat in the grocery lines.
8877160	8878160	Thank you.
8878160	8883760	Um, my FU of the week, I'm putting this in for Alan, goes to Del Taco.
8883760	8887920	Um, no, I have a good reason, because we actually went over to the drive-thru to get him a quick
8887920	8889600	lunch that he could take on the train with him.
8889600	8894120	Yeah, we sat in the drive-thru for 35 minutes, uh, before we finally got our food and, uh,
8894120	8896160	he missed his train as a result.
8896160	8900320	Now, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to have him here an extra day, but, you know,
8900320	8904880	he had things he wanted to do, so, kind of irritating when they take a very, very long
8904880	8905880	time.
8905880	8907040	What was their explanation?
8907040	8908040	They didn't really have one.
8908040	8909040	Huh.
8909040	8910040	They were just busy.
8910040	8911040	Ow.
8911040	8913040	I know, right?
8913040	8917040	So otherwise, FU to the fact that I have to get up at six in the morning tomorrow.
8917040	8918040	Ugh.
8918040	8919040	Wham.
8919040	8920040	Sad.
8920040	8921880	Do you have any FUs of the weak rice princess?
8921880	8927480	Yeah, FU to everything 3D, and, uh, FU to stinky farts.
8927480	8928480	Uh.
8928480	8929480	Excuse me.
8929480	8931480	That about covers it.
8931480	8932480	The doctor?
8932480	8937560	FU to 3D as well, because I hate 3D forever, pound it, explosion.
8937560	8941520	And also, FU to American TV for not having as many gay kisses as British TV.
8941520	8944760	Bring on the gay kisses, American TV.
8944760	8946480	I'll show you a gay kiss right now.
8946480	8949320	Whoa, oh my god, they really kissed.
8949320	8951840	They did it.
8951840	8954840	Alan, they totally kissed.
8954840	8955840	Alright.
8955840	8961360	Couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username
8961360	8962360	on Skype, orange launcher.
8962360	8963840	I should probably boot Skype, huh?
8963840	8965960	But not yet, because we still got two more stories to go.
8965960	8972280	Yes, who would have thought that D3 would announce that they're releasing Earth Defense
8972280	8975040	Force Insect Armageddon.
8975040	8976040	Really?
8976040	8978840	On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
8978840	8986400	Wow, that's wonderful news that I wish I knew earlier, but didn't know it until just now.
8986400	8989080	And they did release a little teaser, which is pretty awesome.
8989080	8994160	It's gonna be developed now by the people that did, and I don't know if this is a bad
8994160	9001600	thing or not, the people that did the EAT LED Return of Matt Hazard game.
9001600	9003360	But the way I look at it, like this, okay?
9003360	9008040	The original Earth Defense Force 2017 game was pretty crappy.
9008040	9013980	When you look at all the development side of it, I mean, the game had no physics.
9013980	9018120	The game was very laggy.
9018120	9019420	It was just fun, though.
9019420	9020460	And this game looks fun, too.
9020460	9023160	It's supposed to take place now in New Detroit.
9023160	9028420	The graphics are updated, and by the screenshot, looks like we get the jetpack from number
9028420	9030660	two, which is pretty awesome.
9030660	9035240	So I am very looking forward to this game, it's supposed to be coming out in February.
9035240	9037400	SSG100Matt says, the game is doomed!
9037400	9039520	And he actually says, doomed!
9039520	9041160	It's gonna be awesome.
9041160	9042360	I don't care.
9042360	9046000	Well, I had no idea this game was gonna be coming out.
9046000	9050680	And I'm really happy that no one seemed to care that Loki, you know...
9050680	9055240	Loki is saying this for the very first time, I mean, on this program.
9055240	9060280	One more news story for you guys, and it has to do with a new world record in video games!
9060280	9061280	Sweet!
9061280	9062280	Sweet!
9062280	9064000	And the winner is Mafia 2!
9064000	9065000	Yay!
9065000	9067520	And what did Mafia 2 get?
9067520	9074160	Well, Mafia 2 uses the word fuck more than any other video game!
9074160	9075160	Yay!
9075160	9076160	Yay!
9076160	9079840	They won the award for most swearing in a video game.
9079840	9080840	That's right.
9080840	9081840	Fuck yeah.
9081840	9082840	The fuck they did!
9082840	9088640	Um, uh, House of the Dead Overkill was the previous title that had 189 uses of the word
9088640	9089640	fuck.
9089640	9094000	Like, well, you know, fuck, or fucking, or motherfucker, all of that.
9094000	9107560	But now, apparently, um, Mafia 2 has more than 200 instances of fuck.
9107560	9108560	What the fuck did you say?
9108560	9109560	I couldn't hear.
9109560	9111560	I was talking.
9111560	9112640	Congratulations.
9112640	9118640	I mean, you guys, that's just really immature, to say fuck as many times as possible in a
9118640	9119640	short period.
9119640	9120640	That's really immature.
9120640	9121640	Because we've never had a fuck show.
9121640	9122640	No.
9122640	9123640	No.
9123640	9124640	No.
9124640	9125640	That we would never stoop so loud.
9125640	9126640	That would be fucking ridiculous.
9126640	9127640	That would be extremely fucking immature.
9127640	9131320	And we would never do anything like that because, you know, we're intelligent gamers.
9131320	9132320	We're classy.
9132320	9133320	We're classy.
9133320	9135680	Stop saying fuck.
9135680	9137360	Classy like the playboys that were in Mafia 2.
9137360	9140080	Why don't you give us a call and we'll talk?
9140080	9144440	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9144440	9146640	We'll let Rice Princess answer all the calls tonight.
9146640	9147640	Is that sounding fun?
9147640	9148640	Can I answer the calls tonight?
9148640	9149640	Yeah.
9149640	9150640	Sure.
9150640	9151640	I'm classy as fuck.
9151640	9152640	All right.
9152640	9154760	Rice Princess is going to answer all the calls for us tonight.
9154760	9161400	So call and talk to Rice Princess at 1-877-GAME-OLR and she will talk to our listeners.
9161400	9164080	And don't ask me anything stupid.
9164080	9166000	I'll jump in and help if you need it.
9166000	9167000	Okay.
9167000	9168000	I'll answer the stupid questions.
9168000	9169000	Okay.
9169000	9170000	Just say, Rob, this is a stupid question.
9170000	9171000	Help me out.
9171000	9172000	No, don't make the listeners feel bad.
9172000	9175600	Can I just give you a signal like, Rob, this is a stupid question.
9175600	9176600	Yeah, she can.
9176600	9177600	Okay.
9177600	9178600	Here we go.
9178600	9179600	We got a call coming in.
9179600	9180600	You ready?
9180600	9181600	Yeah.
9181600	9182600	Hi.
9182600	9183600	You're on.
9183600	9184600	OLR person.
9184600	9185600	Hi.
9185600	9186600	Select the Zaku right here.
9186600	9187600	Hi.
9187600	9188600	Yeah.
9188600	9189600	I know.
9189600	9190600	I thought Sky was going to be on, but.
9190600	9191600	Oh, sorry.
9191600	9192840	This is a stupid question, Rob.
9192840	9194320	I guess you should take over.
9194320	9195320	Zaku.
9195320	9201600	Well, I did IMU within the chat and I have good reason to be here tonight.
9201600	9202600	All right.
9202600	9203600	What's your good reason?
9203600	9208800	You know, I actually attended that Halo Reach launch party that Best Buy threw last week,
9208800	9209800	you know, in the city.
9209800	9211680	I actually got in as VIP.
9211680	9212680	Ooh.
9212680	9213680	Let's just say.
9213680	9216120	How did you get in as VIP, fancy pants?
9216120	9219760	Let's just say it's through the company I work for.
9219760	9221440	And they actually do business for Best Buy.
9221440	9224900	They actually build some of their apps for stuff like reward zones.
9224900	9226920	So you had to give a reach around for reach?
9226920	9228360	No, I actually got in.
9228360	9229360	Okay.
9229360	9230920	I actually got in through those connections.
9230920	9235440	But yeah, pretty much it was just typical fanfare launch party with a lot of people
9235440	9237400	trying to get in VIP.
9237400	9242240	But most of the folks, all it was is just like playing Halo Reach before midnight.
9242240	9243280	Wait, wait, wait.
9243280	9245000	What did the VIP people get?
9245000	9246000	What made you?
9246000	9250120	Well, I already know you're VIP because you listen to this show.
9250120	9255080	But what did VIP get that the little peons waiting in line did not get?
9255080	9256080	Did you get the strip bus?
9256080	9257580	A full service bar.
9257580	9258920	We had our own balcony section.
9258920	9259920	Stuff like that.
9259920	9260920	A full service bar.
9260920	9261920	A full service bar.
9261920	9262920	Yes, exactly.
9262920	9267320	Yeah, we had a full bar.
9267320	9268320	So how many people were there?
9268320	9271200	What did they do that was, did they have like a rock concert?
9271200	9272200	I don't know.
9272200	9273200	What did they do?
9273200	9277800	One person, I forgot his name, Kid Cutter or something, he was supposed to have played,
9277800	9281440	but he didn't play exactly, you know, before midnight.
9281440	9285360	But by the time, you know, we left after midnight, he actually got on stage.
9285360	9291120	There's something about him just like being, you know, the unprofessional artist that he
9291120	9294600	He opened for Lady Gaga once when I saw her and he's that guy.
9294600	9295600	He just, day and night.
9295600	9296600	That's him.
9296600	9297600	Yeah.
9297600	9298600	Something like that.
9298600	9299600	I don't care.
9299600	9300600	Okay.
9300600	9303600	He had the crack song in DJ Hero.
9303600	9304600	Day and night.
9304600	9305600	Okay.
9305600	9307600	We heard you the first time, Rob.
9307600	9310400	You sure you didn't do the song?
9310400	9315940	It was just like, it was basically free, you know, free swag, free liquor, free food, playing
9315940	9317200	Halo Reach.
9317200	9320480	One of my friends manages, you know, managed to like win a couple of rounds.
9320480	9324560	I still suck at, you know, at twitch shooters, on controllers.
9324560	9326160	I can't do the sticks.
9326160	9330720	So that's pretty much the highlight of that night and just getting drunk.
9330720	9331720	Were there strippers?
9331720	9332720	On a Monday night.
9332720	9334720	Were there strippers?
9334720	9339360	No, there weren't any strippers unless you count all the fanboys that were actually,
9339360	9347200	you know, donning Halo, Halo, you know, clothing, such as the plasma swords and whatnot.
9347200	9349840	How many women were in line for Halo Reach compared to men?
9349840	9351720	There was a lot of people outside, actually.
9351720	9353520	It was literally stretching around the block.
9353520	9354520	He's dodging the quest.
9354520	9357440	But they were, they were outside and not actually in the line waiting to buy the game, right?
9357440	9358440	They were still inside, though.
9358440	9360280	There was, there were people waiting to get in.
9360280	9361280	That's the thing.
9361280	9362280	Oh, okay.
9362280	9363280	It was like a, you know,
9363280	9366200	But you got to sit up on the balcony and just judge them all, right?
9366200	9367880	Of course, because you know what?
9367880	9369840	I had, you know, I was connected.
9369840	9374760	As I said, I work for the company, our company does business with Best Buy, so they hooked
9374760	9375920	us up.
9375920	9377920	So I thank them for that.
9377920	9378920	All right.
9378920	9384840	But yeah, I mean, aside from that little escapade that I had, I want to talk about, you know,
9384840	9391200	about the fact that, let me see, Konami basically, you know, started to think outside the box
9391200	9396720	for a change in terms of like taking arcade concepts that God knows will not succeed in
9396720	9400160	this nation and trying to take advantage of other platforms.
9400160	9402360	Let me guess, you're talking about U-Beat?
9402360	9408640	Yes, on the iPad, which makes a lot, a lot of sense, given the fact that it's touch-based
9408640	9410680	and the platform is there.
9410680	9415080	That means arcade owners, you know, as much as, you know, as much as I respect them, they
9415080	9419620	won't have to shell out, you know, tons of money for something that may or may not succeed
9419620	9420620	on that medium.
9420620	9427440	And it's a lot, in other words, you could catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
9427440	9428440	That's good.
9428440	9432480	I mean, it's a good, look, I'm more of an Android developer, but even though I have
9432480	9437320	an iPod touch, I do respect the platform, but I don't like the way they, you know, I
9437320	9438680	don't like Apple censoring.
9438680	9440400	How much do you think they'll charge for U-Beat?
9440400	9441400	99 cents?
9441400	9442400	$4.99?
9442400	9444440	I'm pretty certain it'll be $5 at most.
9444440	9445440	You know what they'll do?
9445440	9448520	I bet you it's like 99 cents and then like a dollar a song.
9448520	9449520	Yes, exactly.
9449520	9450800	They're doing DDRS.
9450800	9451800	Gross.
9451800	9456080	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but any other thoughts on
9456080	9457080	the Halo Reach party?
9457080	9461320	If you could sum up the Halo Reach launch party and your VIP access in one word, what
9461320	9462320	would it be?
9462320	9463320	Sausage.
9463320	9464320	Damn.
9464320	9468120	Damn good time for free.
9468120	9469360	That's too many words.
9469360	9470360	Have a good night.
9470360	9471360	Alright.
9471360	9472360	Night.
9472360	9473360	Alright.
9473360	9476680	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio if you'd like to give us
9476680	9480320	a call and tell us about your VIP treatment.
9480320	9481320	And full service.
9481320	9482320	Whoa.
9482320	9483320	I know, right?
9483320	9484320	Fancy schmancy.
9484320	9485320	Fancy schmancy.
9485320	9486320	Hi.
9486320	9487320	You're on Orangelaunchradio.
9487320	9488320	Who's this?
9488320	9489320	It's Con.
9489320	9490320	Hi, whatever you said.
9490320	9491320	What's your question?
9491320	9507840	I was wondering if you guys had heard about the Fable 3 book that's going to be published.
9507840	9508840	Cool.
9508840	9509840	Continue.
9509840	9511840	No, he asked a question, dummy.
9511840	9512840	Cool.
9512840	9513840	Continue.
9513840	9514840	The Fable 3 book.
9514840	9515840	What about it?
9515840	9518920	That's going to be, actually, I don't know much about this either.
9518920	9519920	Tell us about it.
9519920	9521640	Is it going to be a fantasy book?
9521640	9524480	Yeah, it's actually not Fable 3.
9524480	9529280	It's going to be taking place between Fable 2 and Fable 3.
9529280	9533800	And when you purchase the book, it'll have a download code for a special weapon in the
9533800	9534800	game.
9534800	9537920	What's to stop me from going into Barnes and Noble and just copying the code from the book
9537920	9540640	and running home and cashing it in before someone else can?
9540640	9541640	Rude.
9541640	9545120	Honestly, that was my thought as well.
9545120	9549120	Maybe they have it in plastic wrap or something and you, I don't know, set off alarms.
9549120	9551760	You'll set off an alarm if you break the seal.
9551760	9552760	Exactly.
9552760	9555280	The master chief comes down and blows your head off.
9555280	9556280	Close range.
9556280	9557280	Oh, God.
9557280	9558280	Oh.
9558280	9561040	Are you a big fan of Fable?
9561040	9562560	I'm curious about this new game.
9562560	9563560	I don't know.
9563560	9566800	It didn't seem that different from 2 from what I played, but I heard they really improved
9566800	9567800	co-op.
9567800	9571720	I am really jealous that you did get to play it.
9571720	9574560	Yeah, I am a pretty big Fable fan.
9574560	9581360	I'll tell you, when I played it kind, I ran around in a giant chicken suit for like 10
9581360	9585360	minutes and I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like I was playing Furries the
9585360	9586360	game.
9586360	9589040	It's because you were.
9589040	9592560	That actually would be, you know, you like, look, like don't even lie listeners.
9592560	9596560	You know, like if there were like a Furries the game, you'd have to check it out at least
9596560	9597560	once.
9597560	9598560	Like don't even judge.
9598560	9599560	Oh yeah.
9599560	9600560	Just the one time.
9600560	9601560	Just the one time.
9601560	9605600	Try to project onto our listeners, okay, just because you want to do it.
9605600	9607200	I think it would be funny.
9607200	9614280	Yeah, funny and arousing.
9614280	9618200	Do you think, do you think that there's enough Fable mythos out there and enough world that
9618200	9621880	they've constructed out of the games that will make for pretty decent fantasy novels?
9621880	9625040	Because, you know, it's not like novels for video games is anything too new.
9625040	9627480	I mean, Warcraft has a bunch of them.
9627480	9628800	Even Halo has novels.
9628800	9629800	Resident Evil.
9629800	9630800	Resident Evil.
9630800	9635040	There's a lot of games, the FX9 novels back in the day, Castlevania, Blaster Master, heck
9635040	9636040	yeah.
9636040	9638280	Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.
9638280	9642240	Is there enough substance in Fable to lend itself to books well, you think?
9642240	9645120	There should be.
9645120	9650640	And besides, they have someone from, I think it was Wizards of the Coast, writing the novel,
9650640	9653120	The Makers of Dungeons and Dragons.
9653120	9658160	Oh, and now Irene likes Dungeons and Dragons, so maybe you should get, why don't you play
9658160	9659160	Fable?
9659160	9660160	It's actually kind of neat.
9660160	9662120	Because I'm too busy playing D&D.
9662120	9663120	What a good answer.
9663120	9667120	Well, you put me on the spot, okay, you asshole?
9667120	9669120	That's what we do here on this show.
9669120	9673520	Because it's expensive and not a lot of people have the money to turn off on a $60 game.
9673520	9675200	Wait, what console is it for?
9675200	9677400	It's for the Xbox 360, your favorite.
9677400	9678400	There's your answer.
9678400	9679400	Ding, ding, ding.
9679400	9682160	It's not my fault you're poor.
9682160	9683160	All right.
9683160	9684160	It's not my fault you're an asshole.
9684160	9685160	All right.
9685160	9686160	And you smell.
9686160	9688520	Let's see what else I want to ask Kaim.
9688520	9689520	I don't know.
9689520	9692640	Kaim, quickly, anything else you're looking forward to this holiday season?
9692640	9697640	All right, Fallout, Grinch News Plus 5, Fable 3.
9697640	9705240	Besides that, I'm not looking forward to anything until next year when Tell of Your Rising comes
9705240	9706240	out.
9706240	9708320	Ah, that is going to be a very popular game.
9708320	9711080	So no interest in the motion control stuff.
9711080	9714440	No Kinect, no Move in your future?
9714440	9719280	When they come out with the Kinect feature in Fable 3, where I'm able to growth the other
9719280	9720280	player?
9720280	9721280	Sure.
9721280	9722280	All right.
9722280	9725320	We'll leave it at that.
9725320	9726320	Have a good one, Kaim.
9726320	9728040	Thanks so much for the call.
9728040	9729040	We'll see you around.
9729040	9730040	All right.
9730040	9731040	You guys take it easy.
9731040	9732040	Later.
9732040	9733040	You too.
9733040	9734040	Bye bye.
9734040	9735040	Bye.
9735040	9736040	What's this private message you're sending me, DarkSakura?
9736040	9737040	You have a microphone.
9737040	9738040	You can just tell me.
9738040	9739040	It's something that Tiara said.
9739040	9740040	It's funny.
9740040	9741040	You should read it.
9741040	9742040	Also, there is Furries the game.
9742040	9743680	It's called Worgen in the new WoW expansion.
9743680	9748960	Actually, I was reading a really funny story on WoW.com about how apparently Worgens may
9748960	9751960	not get a mount because Worgens will be the mount.
9751960	9752960	We'll just run.
9752960	9753960	Yeah.
9753960	9754960	That's actually it.
9754960	9755960	Worgens will be the mount.
9755960	9756960	Okay.
9756960	9762080	Which, WoW nerd, the Tauren actually had an ability called Planes Runner in the early
9762080	9763080	days of WoW.
9763080	9764080	I remember that.
9764080	9765080	That's right.
9765080	9768200	Where they could actually be the mounts themselves, but they were patched in with Kodos in a later
9768200	9769200	expansion.
9769200	9771400	Aren't Jeweds kind of like that too?
9771400	9773840	Like they can just have their own flying shit?
9773840	9774840	Yes.
9774840	9775840	Okay.
9775840	9776840	How about another call?
9776840	9777840	You ready, Irene?
9777840	9778840	Yes.
9778840	9779840	Okay.
9779840	9780840	Hi, Ryan.
9780840	9781840	Oh, damn.
9781840	9782840	What's up?
9782840	9783840	Fuck you.
9783840	9785080	I'm booting you from the guild.
9785080	9786080	Shut up.
9786080	9787080	Whatever.
9787080	9788080	Whatever.
9788080	9789080	I'll G kick you quicker than you could me.
9789080	9790080	Oh.
9790080	9791080	In fact, look.
9791080	9792080	I'm on the game right now.
9792080	9793080	Okay.
9793080	9794080	Hold on.
9794080	9795080	Hold on.
9795080	9796080	Hold on.
9796080	9797080	Radio 101.
9797080	9798080	Real quick, Irene.
9798080	9799080	Even though their name comes up on the screen, you're supposed to, for radio's sake, just
9799080	9801360	play stupid and say, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
9801360	9802360	Who is this?
9802360	9804080	Even though you can clearly see his name is Ryan B.
9804080	9805080	Whoa.
9805080	9806080	Whoa.
9806080	9807080	Whoa.
9807080	9808080	It sounds weird on the radio.
9808080	9809080	His name is Ryan B.
9809080	9810080	What?
9810080	9811080	Stop it.
9811080	9812080	What?
9812080	9813720	You have a two-way personal information there.
9813720	9815360	I'm not going to give away the whole thing.
9815360	9819600	I didn't say the whole thing, but take it off your Skype info.
9819600	9820600	Yeah.
9820600	9821600	Sure.
9821600	9825160	You can all see it in your studio.
9825160	9827400	Because otherwise, you sound like Miss Cleo.
9827400	9828400	Like-
9828400	9829400	Go to me now.
9829400	9830400	That's because I am Chad.
9830400	9831400	I already know your name, Chad.
9831400	9832400	How can I help you today, Ryan?
9832400	9836960	And you're going to get booted out of the guild.
9836960	9839840	Another reference that most of your listeners probably don't get, Rob.
9839840	9840840	It's true.
9840840	9841840	You're like, Miss Cleo, who?
9841840	9842840	I know, right?
9842840	9843840	Indeed.
9843840	9844840	Anyway.
9844840	9845840	Oh, sorry, Irene.
9845840	9846840	Oh, yeah.
9846840	9847840	What do you want, Ryan?
9847840	9848840	You.
9848840	9849840	Gasp.
9849840	9850840	Trauma.
9850840	9855200	Okay, so what do you really want, besides me, everyone?
9855200	9856200	Me.
9856200	9858720	Oh, that's the truth right there.
9858720	9859720	All right, come on.
9859720	9860720	No, really.
9860720	9861720	What do you want?
9861720	9862720	Oh, no.
9862720	9866680	I was just calling in to see how excited you are about Civ V coming out this coming Tuesday.
9866680	9873080	You know, I am not excited to spend $50 on a game I'll probably play twice, because the
9873080	9878600	stupid wow and all the stupid time sink I spent on that game.
9878600	9879600	But I love my guildies.
9879600	9883560	Yeah, I see how much you've been spending time on my gift for you.
9883560	9884560	Well, right?
9884560	9887600	Like, I don't- Do you know how much I played StarCraft II?
9887600	9888600	Not enough.
9888600	9889600	No, I understand that completely.
9889600	9890600	Not enough.
9890600	9893480	Very time consuming, especially with everything coming out now for it.
9893480	9901040	The bummer with starting a late raiding schedule, like our guild did, is that now we don't have
9901040	9905520	that little- Usually, raiding kind of comes in cycles, and the content first comes out,
9905520	9909040	you raid it a million times, and then it kind of dies off, and that's your time to go play
9909040	9910040	other games.
9910040	9911040	We haven't had that.
9911040	9912040	Yeah.
9912040	9915360	So, if I want to go play other games- Like, you know what the word late and raid
9915360	9916680	is all in the same sentence.
9916680	9921560	I mean, you guys, what, eight o'clock your time, by the time I get out of it, it's about
9921560	9923640	3.30 in the morning for me.
9923640	9925600	Not my fault you joined the West Coast Guild.
9925600	9926600	All right.
9926600	9927600	Mm-hmm.
9927600	9932320	Anyway, for the listeners that don't play WoW, is there anything else on your mind tonight?
9932320	9937520	No, the whole- The good old gaming GOG, that's a whole rouge.
9937520	9941360	We figured that out come by Wednesday when they announced that they're actually taking
9941360	9943400	their stuff out of beta and actually going live.
9943400	9948720	There has been reports now that's claiming that it has been all been one big rouge, and
9948720	9952240	now they're probably going to pay dearly for what they did to all their paying customers,
9952240	9953240	so- Are they dicks or are they dicks?
9953240	9956800	I hope they have something in store for them, because a lot of people are going to still
9956800	9959400	be upset by all that, so.
9959400	9960400	Are you going to be upset?
9960400	9963240	Are you going to boycott their website, and I'm never shopping here again.
9963240	9964240	No, not really.
9964240	9966320	I never bought anything from them in the first place.
9966320	9968320	I'm not even the least bit worried, so.
9968320	9970960	I bet you, like, half of- I mean, a lot of the games that they have,
9970960	9971960	I already have.
9971960	9976640	So, I mean, like, the Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, all the old games, I'll buy
9976640	9979800	Jerky anyway, so I'm not even the least bit worried, so.
9979800	9980800	Alright.
9980800	9982080	But, you know, people are going to.
9982080	9983080	People are going to be like that.
9983080	9984680	People are going to be like, why did you pull this on us?
9984680	9985680	We thought you were being real.
9985680	9991200	A lot of people didn't know what was really going on, and now you do this, and it's like,
9991200	9992200	well, you know, screw you.
9992200	9996960	I'll find another place to buy the game or torrent or whatever, so.
9996960	10002760	Tigerclaw in chat says, I'm, I'm, I think he, oh, I'm really curious to hear how Rob
10002760	10004920	sounds like while playing WoW.
10004920	10006000	I mean, how he acts.
10006000	10008680	I hope it's not like that, a Nixxie, a white guy.
10008680	10013280	How do I sound playing WoW, Ryan, since you've been on Ventrilo with me playing World of
10013280	10014280	Warcraft?
10014280	10015280	Day.
10015280	10016280	Alright.
10016280	10017280	No, I'm kidding.
10017280	10018280	I'm kidding.
10018280	10019280	No, you sound like you do now.
10019280	10020280	No.
10020280	10022280	It's, it's like we pretty much, you know, it's, it's normal.
10022280	10025160	I mean, nobody gets really too, you know, crazy in there.
10025160	10028280	And I like to do, I like to do my wacky DJ voice for, you know, the, the writers.
10028280	10030120	No, you do not do your wacky DJ voice.
10030120	10031120	Hey, everybody!
10031120	10033120	Let's go to the Summoning Stone!
10033120	10034120	Alright!
10034120	10039200	Let's go over to Tasslehop for the traffic.
10039200	10040200	Alright.
10040200	10044440	Which is the best name ever, because Dragonlance is awesome.
10044440	10045440	I didn't even do that.
10045440	10046920	I didn't even try, I didn't even pretend to come back from that.
10046920	10047920	I couldn't do that.
10047920	10048920	Watch.
10048920	10049920	I, but I couldn't.
10049920	10051280	Wednesday, I'm going to do that, you know?
10051280	10053320	Alright, you guys, it's eight o'clock.
10053320	10055120	Let's all get to the Stone.
10055120	10056920	We're going to get some Leap Purples tonight.
10056920	10059360	Tonight, we're going to get past the Blood Queen.
10059360	10060360	Right after this.
10060360	10061360	No, you're not.
10061360	10062360	Alright.
10062360	10063360	I'm hanging up on you.
10063360	10064360	Alright, you too.
10064360	10065360	Bye.
10065360	10066360	Bye.
10066360	10067360	Bye.
10067360	10068360	I love wow calls.
10068360	10069360	Me too.
10069360	10072320	Because there's not enough wow chat on this show that I want to start a whole other wow
10072320	10074480	show, because there's not enough of them.
10074480	10078880	SSJ, I hope, I hope there's people out there that would listen to a Robin X to her wow
10078880	10079880	show.
10079880	10080880	I might.
10080880	10081880	I don't know.
10081880	10082880	At least we'd have half a listener.
10082880	10083880	Aren't I confident?
10083880	10084880	Yes.
10084880	10085880	Alright, let's see.
10085880	10093400	SSJ 100 Matt says, you should celebrate this call by having a cupcake.
10093400	10096800	That's a total inside joke.
10096800	10097800	That's very rude.
10097800	10098800	That's brilliant.
10098800	10099800	That's very rude.
10099800	10100800	You ready for another call?
10100800	10101800	Yes.
10101800	10102800	Alright.
10102800	10105560	Hi, you've reached Orange Slut Radio.
10105560	10106560	Who is this?
10106560	10109560	Hi, this is Nancy Neater.
10109560	10110560	Hi.
10110560	10111560	What's up?
10111560	10120840	Hey, well, I just want to pass along a little tidbit, a bit of information to whatever listeners
10120840	10124720	there are out there that's not in chat.
10124720	10133160	Basically, there's an anime show that I just discovered called Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.
10133160	10134160	Just now?
10134160	10135160	It's a...
10135160	10140560	Hey, I just discovered Hoarders, and that's been on for like a year and a half, and I'm
10140560	10142600	just finding out about it, so you know what?
10142600	10143600	Back off.
10143600	10144600	Judging you.
10144600	10145600	Sorry, continue.
10145600	10146600	Sorry.
10146600	10155640	Basically, I just discovered Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood myself, and it's basically like
10155640	10165080	a remake of an earlier show with the same name, and it's pretty damn good.
10165080	10174760	In fact, I have no idea if it's on DVD or Blu-Ray or anything like that, but I happen
10174760	10181920	to know that it is available for digital download.
10181920	10189560	If you want to risk going that route, again, I was complaining about digital download before,
10189560	10203960	but at least right now, the first 13 episodes are actually on sale on PSN for 99 cents each.
10203960	10212840	It's cheap, but at the same time, if you guys have listened to my calls a few months ago,
10212840	10222600	it's kind of a risk with digital download, so if you want to take the risk, go for it,
10222600	10226280	or if you want to save some money, go ahead.
10226280	10232680	You don't think it's worth the risk, then look for a physical copy.
10232680	10237240	So all together to get the whole series, it's like 14 bucks basically, what, 13 episodes
10237240	10240280	99 cents a pop?
10240280	10247080	Really it's only the first half of the series that's on sale.
10247080	10248080	I think there's like 25-
10248080	10250000	Aha, that's how they get you.
10250000	10253280	They sucker you in to buy the first half, and then they're like, oh, but the second
10253280	10256960	half is double the price.
10256960	10257960	Exactly like that, Rob.
10257960	10262600	That's what they do at Sony headquarters.
10262600	10269240	The weird thing is though, I'm not totally sure how Microsoft does their video marketplace.
10269240	10275600	I really haven't used it yet, but I know at least over on PSN, a lot of times they'll
10275600	10283920	have weekly sales on certain things, whatever's half off for that week, and a lot of times
10283920	10293520	they even give away pilots to shows for free, and the whole thing, hey, this pilot that
10293520	10300320	I got for free is good, might as well buy the rest of the series.
10300320	10311680	But like I said, being here at risk if your system fucks up, there's a chance that unless
10311680	10316000	you play your cards right, you could lose out on the content that you bought.
10316000	10320760	And you have to demand to speak to a supervisor, correct, based on what I learned in your previous
10320760	10323800	calls about Sony trauma.
10323800	10334960	Yeah, luckily, at least in the situations I've been in, I managed to work it out, but
10334960	10340160	like I said earlier in the call, weigh out the pros and cons.
10340160	10343240	I have a solution to all of your Microsoft problems, by the way.
10343240	10344760	This is Sony problems, though.
10344760	10346760	Sony problems, whatever.
10346760	10348400	Hook up a computer to your TV.
10348400	10349400	Seriously.
10349400	10351200	No more problem.
10351200	10352200	It works for us.
10352200	10355560	Okay, can I ask you a question?
10355560	10357040	Not to completely derail what you were saying.
10357040	10359040	Where are you from?
10359040	10360040	Buffalo, New York.
10360040	10361040	Okay.
10361040	10364040	I was trying to place your accent.
10364040	10372360	Yeah, the weird thing is, my accent is not typical, though, because to get a little personal,
10372360	10374240	I'm half Canadian.
10374240	10378680	Everyone on my mother's side of the family is Canadian, and I spend a lot of time around
10378680	10379680	my Canadian relatives.
10379680	10382440	We don't like Canadians in these parts.
10382440	10390800	Yeah, so my accent is a blend of the bothalonian accent and the Canadian accent.
10390800	10396320	That's very cool, because I was actually thinking Great Lakes area, but that's actually kind
10396320	10397320	of close.
10397320	10400520	I don't want no damn Tim Hortons in my backyard.
10400520	10405760	I'm sorry to completely derail what you said, but I've been trying to place it for several
10405760	10406760	calls now.
10406760	10409720	I'm going to say goodbye to Spaznator for now, because we get to go wrap up.
10409720	10414320	But Spaznator, thank you for the deal alert, and let's hope your PlayStation doesn't break
10414320	10415320	again.
10415320	10416320	Sure.
10416320	10417320	Have a good one.
10417320	10418320	You too.
10418320	10419320	Thanks.
10419320	10420520	So you go into our chat room with some comments.
10420520	10424120	Derek H says, there's this anime called Robotech that I just found out about.
10424120	10426120	It's pretty good and deserves to be popular.
10426120	10427120	Aw, rude.
10427120	10428120	Aw.
10428120	10429120	That's awful.
10429120	10430120	Awfully funny.
10430120	10431120	Meanie.
10431120	10434640	No, he continues, whoa, did you guys know that they made a cartoon based on that Speed
10434640	10435640	Racer movie?
10435640	10436920	I just discovered it.
10436920	10437920	That one made me a little for real.
10437920	10443560	Did you know that there was this cartoon they made about a little boy called Adam Boy?
10443560	10448400	Did you know that there's actually an old Battlestar Galactica that they did back in
10448400	10449400	the 70s?
10449400	10450400	Uh-uh.
10450400	10451540	And Starbucks, a dude?
10451540	10452540	You know what?
10452540	10454360	I've never seen any of the new episodes, only the old ones.
10454360	10455800	Oh, the new ones are actually really good.
10455800	10456800	They're super good.
10456800	10457800	I ain't lying.
10457800	10458800	Starbucks cannot be a chick.
10458800	10459800	And I love this.
10459800	10460800	It's a coffee.
10460800	10466400	Wait, this was my favorite comment during that whole call when Irene answered the call.
10466400	10469360	Yzom says, orange slut radio discusses anime.
10469360	10471920	Are you sure this is an orange virgin radio?
10471920	10476600	No, it's orange anti-radio, orange tentacle rape radio.
10476600	10478600	No, trust me, it's not.
10478600	10480080	All right.
10480080	10483040	R stands for rape.
10483040	10485040	Wow.
10485040	10490440	What is wrong with you?
10490440	10491600	This show has just come to a switch call.
10491600	10493800	That's horribly inappropriate.
10493800	10495480	I was talking about tentacles.
10495480	10496480	All right.
10496480	10499560	I really apologize to those callers that didn't get through tonight, but we've got to go and
10499560	10500800	wrap things up.
10500800	10502280	And yeah, we're done.
10502280	10503280	We're out of here for the night.
10503280	10504280	It's nine o'clock.
10504280	10505280	I got homework to do.
10505280	10506280	That's right.
10506280	10509120	So thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to Orange Laundry Radio.
10509120	10510960	We really appreciate it, you guys.
10510960	10514520	Of course, if you're listening on the podcast and you want to join us live sometime, please
10514520	10515520	do.
10515520	10516520	Sunday nights at All Games Radio.
10516520	10519120	Just a heads up though, I'm going to be gone in two weeks.
10519120	10523480	And I don't know if you really guys are doing, we're going to have a special, a special co-host
10523480	10524480	via Skype.
10524480	10525480	Oh, okay.
10525480	10528480	I'm very curious to see how that show turns out.
10528480	10532840	So make sure next week we show you how to click the buttons to go live and all that.
10532840	10533840	Okay.
10533840	10534840	You know how to do that.
10534840	10535840	All right.
10535840	10536840	Okay.
10536840	10537840	I won't be here in two weeks.
10537840	10540200	Mr. I didn't send anybody the iTunes information, so we had to figure it out for ourselves.
10540200	10541200	Oh, I forgot.
10541200	10542200	You don't know how I figured it out.
10542200	10543200	It's okay.
10543200	10544200	We figured it out.
10544200	10545200	See, you're empowered women.
10545200	10546200	You don't need no man's help.
10546200	10547200	I didn't do it.
10547200	10548200	Someone else did it.
10548200	10551240	So, uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop for
10551240	10552240	the night.
10552240	10557520	Uh, first off rice princess, thank you very much for being here tonight and please come
10557520	10558520	back.
10558520	10559520	Okay.
10559520	10560520	The listeners.
10560520	10561520	Love you.
10561520	10562520	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
10562520	10563520	I hate you all.
10563520	10564520	Fuck you.
10564520	10565520	I'm just kidding.
10565520	10567520	No, I really like you guys.
10567520	10568520	You're cool.
10568520	10569520	All right.
10569520	10570520	Cool.
10570520	10571520	Ryan.
10571520	10572520	I'm kicking you from the Guild.
10572520	10573520	All right.
10573520	10578320	Ryan is here and give him the damn mic.
10578320	10579320	Race princess.
10579320	10580320	Oh, I'm the doctor.
10580320	10581320	How's it going?
10581320	10582320	Rob?
10582320	10583320	Will you give him the microphone?
10583320	10584320	This is the doctor.
10584320	10585320	What you talking about?
10585320	10593760	Did you see the latest advertisement about, you know, things and thank you so much for
10593760	10594760	being here tonight.
10594760	10596960	No, that's exactly how I sound.
10596960	10598960	She got it very good.
10598960	10599960	Indeed.
10599960	10600960	See, I told you.
10600960	10601960	Hey.
10601960	10610640	What's the matter Rob?
10610640	10611640	Dark Sakura.
10611640	10613120	You have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
10613120	10614840	I hate algebra.
10614840	10615840	Me too.
10615840	10616840	Loki.
10616840	10617840	Do you have a final thought tonight?
10617840	10618840	I have to charge my devices.
10618840	10620320	They're all dead now.
10620320	10621480	Jerks.
10621480	10625020	My final thought is I have to charge my life.
10625020	10626360	It's dead now.
10626360	10627360	That was deeper.
10627360	10628360	I know, right?
10628360	10629360	Okay.
10629360	10630360	Thank you guys so much for listening.
10630360	10631360	We really appreciate it.
10631360	10632360	Thank you for your support.
10632360	10635920	If you like what you heard, all we ask, tell two people about the show.
10635920	10637400	Help us spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.
10637400	10641060	If you don't have any friends, which I highly doubt, but you can always also leave us nice
10641060	10642060	reviews on iTunes.
10642060	10643240	We appreciate that.
10643240	10648400	Or any other, you know, place that discusses podcasts, you know, by what, podcast alley
10648400	10649400	or whatever.
10649400	10653280	Just any place where they're discussing podcasts, say a good word or two and help us spread
10653280	10655040	the word about Orange Launch Radio.
10655040	10659120	If you didn't like what you heard here, then fine, but support independent radio.
10659120	10662320	There's a lot of other great shows at All Games Radio that run throughout the week and
10662320	10663320	just, you know, go to iTunes.
10663320	10668320	There's like 50 billion podcasts out there, but try to download one that actually gets
10668320	10672560	updated once a week or at least once a month because, you know, iTunes has some things
10672560	10675240	that have been molding since 2007 still on the store.
10675240	10677120	So, you know, just good luck with that.
10677120	10678120	Yeah.
10678120	10679120	Anyhow, thanks again.
10679120	10680640	Have a wonderful night.
10680640	10681640	We'll see you next week.
10681640	10684640	We're going to do this all over again with more of Orange Launch Radio.
10684640	10691640	Until then, good night.
10714640	10716440	See you next week.
