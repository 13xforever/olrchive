14200	26427	Tonight, September 19th, 2010, a much-hyped MMO shuts down after only three months, Konami and Harmonix settle their Rock Band lawsuit, and the Nielsen Report rates the effectiveness of ads in video games.
31775	36516	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36596	39657	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
40117	48299	We meet live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
48340	51800	Except tonight, actually we didn't meet after the Bobby Blackwolf show because he's on vacation.
52641	53161	How dare he?
53581	56082	Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours.
56782	60923	Say hello to my awesome co-hosts, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61428	62168	Buh.
62509	63269	How are you, my friend?
63589	64190	Buh.
65250	65871	That good, huh?
65991	67412	I'm doing fantastic, Rob.
67532	68692	I'm glad to hear it.
68752	69673	And how are you today?
70133	70533	Super.
70593	71494	Thanks for asking.
71714	72074	Great.
73135	73415	All right.
73535	77277	Also joining us, as he does every week, say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.
77497	78858	That last fry didn't taste good.
79279	86563	I'm sorry to hear that, but I heard you exclaim, literally as the opening credits are rolling on our show, I hear Loki go, ooh, bonus onion ring.
87833	88253	Thanks for watching!
110041	112643	Pretty busy week in gaming thanks to the Tokyo Game Show.
112683	115485	There's a lot of news and stuff going on here in the States as well.
115545	117206	Just like so much to talk about tonight.
118146	123690	We supposedly have some guests coming, but I got a text that they're running late, of course, because these people always run late.
124030	124591	Shh, don't tell them.
125271	128953	But I'm assuming they'll be here any moment, so we'll introduce them whenever they show up.
129454	135958	They probably won't come into the studio quietly, so I apologize in advance for any derailment that is bound to happen on this lovely radio program.
137153	138053	It's okay, I dressed up.
138433	140754	Let's talk, yes you did, you went all out today.
141114	143794	Alright, she's wearing her pajamas just so you guys know.
144414	148995	Alright, let's start it off with how was your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week.
149035	154436	And I know DarkSakura finally jumped into something because I got a text message earlier this week that let me know she did.
154536	156156	So what's up DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
156176	162737	I started Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they transformed into special people.
164258	165958	So that's as far as I am right now.
167743	180012	And I'm playing The Sims 3 right now because Dan got me Ambitions And Dan's home from his trip and I'm so happy And that's it So Final Fantasy XIII, what do you think of the battle system?
180072	181874	It kind of takes forever to get going, doesn't it?
182514	195024	Yeah, I'm like, the game that plays itself I'm just going to sit back and eat some rice and watch a movie Which is basically how I've been treating it It's like, oh, it's a movie that I can push a button every so often
196104	196865	Thanks for watching!
214684	218447	I had a long day yesterday because it was Yom Kippur.
220208	226693	To sum it up in a nutshell, it's the Day of Atonement.
226713	229636	You apologize a lot and don't need anything.
229656	232638	That's putting a really simplistic view on it.
233759	236121	It's a very beautiful service.
236481	239183	I was very happy to have attended all day.
240164	242186	I was very happy to eat when the sun went down.
242938	246522	So, after 24 hours of fasting, Betty fucking Crocker sound pretty good, huh?
246682	249464	More like 20... 26 hours?
249985	249464	25?
250165	251206	Oh, but who's counting?
251246	252627	Before sundown and then post sundown.
253208	253368	Yeah.
253809	255150	Well, you end up counting.
255851	256731	Um, but, uh...
258493	259254	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
278290	300643	and three poster designs tomorrow speaking of other podcasts the Robin Extifer Warcraft show is supposed to start this week but sadly we ran into some technical difficulties we can't seem to do Skype on my computer I can't do Skype I'm frustrated no I can't do Skype on my home computer like I can on the one here in the studio so we weren't able to do our little thing so I don't know what we're gonna do we'll figure it out we're smart people
301914	302954	Just in time for Cataclysm.
302974	303955	Are you smart fellers?
304395	304595	Huh?
304655	306216	Are you smart fellers or fart smellers?
306776	307076	Shut up.
307816	310317	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
310677	310917	Hello.
310977	311657	How was your gaming week?
312918	313598	It was fine.
314158	317900	I got my iPod finally, so I downloaded a bunch of stuff on there.
319561	326830	and, uh, let's see, I'm, I tried a little bit of, uh, Plants vs. Zombies, because I have yet to jump into that, and it's pretty fun.
327550	330574	Uh, hopefully gonna play a little bit more of that, other than, like, two minutes worth.
331375	334279	And then, uh, what else did I play?
334299	334339	Um...
336775	340156	Played some of the Mirror's Edge game on the iPhone, which is kind of neat.
341857	345599	It's very simplistic, but it still has that kind of same look as the full game.
348000	352922	Fruit Ninja, because that's really easy and casual.
353202	357383	So I actually kind of downloaded that because it's actually one of the ones that is supported by Game Center.
357483	360084	So I thought it'd be neat to try out.
361585	369287	And of course I had to download Robot Unicorn Attack because, well, I don't think I need to explain myself there.
372107	376268	It's so surreal to me that you're coming in here and playing with your little iPod now.
376548	380469	This is after a good, I don't know, eight years of just Apple hatred.
380529	381829	No, I still hate Apple.
382129	383250	No, I still hate Apple.
383270	384790	But you're sitting there playing with your iPod.
384990	386330	Like, hey Rob, let me see what apps you have.
386810	387791	Oh, Jamie, let me see your phone.
388471	389671	It's just really funny to me.
390120	393823	Well, okay, it's very convenient for browsing the web.
393863	399428	For example, Nelly's mom came over and she's like, I need the 800 number for AAA.
400049	402331	And Nelly was like, okay, well, let me boot up my laptop.
402411	407155	I'm like, okay, hold on, let me real quickly just turn my iPod on, hit the web browser, done.
407375	408136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
425576	427197	So yeah, so it's neat.
427357	433179	And then the other thing that I got with that is I got a Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200, which is a 3G hotspot.
433419	437281	In fact, I'm actually using that right now to connect to the web.
437721	443184	It's literally, it is smaller than the iPod that I have right now, but it works pretty well.
443784	447806	And it's like 40 bucks a month flat, so I'm kind of digging that a little bit.
449646	452808	Console games, of course, Playmore Grand Theft Auto, because that's just...
454188	454669	A given.
456329	459651	Really ain't playing too much else other than that because I just haven't had time.
460371	465113	Wife's keeping me busy with keeping the baby out of her hair.
466513	467674	Freaking baby.
467834	471516	Unfortunately, that gives me no time to do anything.
471776	480459	I'm really sad because I wanted to work on stuff this weekend and instead I had to go shop for groceries for two hours and run a bunch of errands.
480519	482200	I come back home and she's like...
482640	486281	I've been sitting here with the baby for all this time and he won't stop crying.
486362	487182	Here, you take him.
487242	489583	It's like, oh yeah, I haven't been doing anything at all.
489603	492204	I've just been, you know, playing around.
492304	493764	That's what you get for making babies.
496803	502485	So, yeah, that's basically all I've done this week is mainly download a ton of apps.
502605	505566	I've spent way too much money on apps, so that's for sure.
505586	507046	I've got to cut back on that.
507226	510687	This little 3G router thingy-ma-bobber you have, what is this again?
510727	511888	A Virgin Mobile?
511928	513268	Well, it's called a MiFi 2200.
513308	514969	They have them through Virgin.
514989	518770	They have them through Sprint, AT&T, I think even.
519510	539135	and but the plan that's the cheapest is actually the virgin plan and it piggybacks on the Sprint Network and it's it's flat $40 and it's you know there's no plan so if you want to use it you pay 40 bucks and you get a full month worth of unlimited bandwidth unlimited data whatever
539454	540075	DarkSakura.com
557054	557574	Thanks for watching!
573806	577889	I have a program to send free text messages so I can do that.
578250	581952	And I have a number that's associated with that now so people can text me if they want to.
583534	587437	You should give out that number here on the show and see what kind of text messages you get during the week.
588137	590039	Hi Loki, I'm in the potty!
592060	593561	I think that would be quite foolish.
596904	602208	Yeah, so I have that, and then, I don't know, I've just, I've been downloading a bunch of junk.
602588	610714	Because that's what, I sit there, you know, I have the baby in my arm, and I'm sitting there just kind of browsing the internet, and I'm like, okay, hmm, what apps could I possibly need?
612575	613075	Oh, I know.
613115	615457	They just talked about Police Scanner app on TV.
615497	616497	I'm going to download that.
616517	617938	He's an appaholic.
618999	619719	Pretty much.
620800	623401	And then in two months, the novelty will wear off.
623962	630886	But hey, it doesn't matter, though, because I didn't really pay any money for this, although I did spend a lot of money on apps, so Apple still wins in this.
631186	635608	Going back to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com, they always make A-plus comments, such as this one.
636108	638970	Alf in chat says, Now Loki's butt will have cancer.
639811	641512	And I'm assuming that's from the router.
641532	641612	Yeah.
642492	648854	I don't always... Being in your butt or next to your butt or wherever it is in close proximity to your butt will somehow give you butt cancer.
648874	654257	Well, I can't really use it too much in my back pocket because if I sit down, it turns it off.
654877	656277	So, that's not good.
658238	660659	But, you know, that's where I store it for now.
661039	665203	I don't store it in my butt, but in my pocket, yes.
665424	669468	But if somebody did store it in their butt, they'd be like 3G everywhere they go.
669488	672531	But it's still cool though, because see, not only can I... You can name the network, Rob's butt.
672571	678077	Not only can I connect to that, but it can sort of port up the five devices at once.
679078	682261	I'd imagine it'd be very slow with five devices connected to it, but...
682898	684699	Hey, I'm connected to your butt right now.
685039	685720	All right.
686340	688661	Let's introduce the guests because they're dying to make a comment.
688821	692103	And it's been forever, really, since these two have been on the show.
692463	693524	But they're quite the duo.
693544	697726	And if you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, I'm sure you've heard these guys on the show.
697807	698987	They're loved by the masses.
699548	699908	Not really.
699928	701028	I just say that to talk about.
701429	703230	Say hello to Rice Princess.
703630	704070	How are you?
706031	706692	Wait, can we hear you?
706852	707292	Is that on?
708726	709848	Lalalala, Jerk
723786	724146	Oh, and hi.
724426	724666	All right.
724766	728148	Also say hello to the one and only The Doctor is back.
728228	728968	I'm The Doctor.
729168	729928	Hey, what's up?
729948	730308	Pretty good.
730328	730629	Pretty good.
730729	736051	And I just want you to say Rob's butt has been in network for years and years and years.
736511	738171	That's pretty much the only comment.
738672	739472	Oh, yeah.
739712	743113	I'm seeing the Sonic Screwdriver, which was also working Rob's butt.
743713	745334	So I'm going to play with the Sonic Screwdriver.
745394	745654	Here you go.
745694	749356	I'm not comfortable with how much of the discussion on this show is about my butt.
750336	751096	I'm not okay with that.
751116	751917	It's your own fault.
752177	752797	It really is.
752817	753017	Yeah.
753860	757501	Alright, well, what the hell have you been up to, Rice Princess?
758081	762662	You haven't been on the show in like a year, it seems like, because I don't think you've been since we've been here at Studio Sakura.
763102	771044	I haven't, and I'm kind of insulted that you didn't notice that the Doctor and I are wearing... You are wearing Masked in Castlevania shirts, because it's old school and new school.
771064	775906	Yeah, mine's better, but... Isn't today a special day in the relationship between you and the Doctor?
776126	778006	Yeah, it's the first time we had sex.
779607	780827	Because he's straight.
781906	782286	And me?
782406	782727	Really?
783047	786389	I thought it was... No, September 9th, 2000.
786929	788771	Oh my gosh.
788831	789731	Was the night we all met.
789971	790832	Oh my gosh.
790872	793574	I think for some reason... No, it was Irene I met in November.
794054	797196	Yeah, and then we all went back to your apartment and played Wheel of Fortune.
797496	797917	Good times.
797937	798557	In Roseville.
799198	799878	And butt sex.
799918	801619	Rob's Network was on that night.
803460	803781	Shut up.
805282	807223	And I've got a gift to regale you with.
807263	807863	You can open later.
807883	809284	You didn't have to bring gifts.
809304	809705	Well, that's right.
809725	810205	But I'll take it.
810305	810745	It's poop.
812847	813267	Yay.
813927	816149	So you're wearing matching Castle... Well, they're not matching Castlevania shirts.
816209	817590	It's old school Castlevania new school.
817790	820571	Mine's Symphony of the Night, so mine's automatically cooler.
820812	821612	Yeah, his is old school.
821632	822152	But his is great.
822212	823173	Yeah, I like his too.
823193	825975	That means we have to push the start key now.
826135	826335	Oh, yeah.
826355	826595	All right.
827075	828076	I'm not going to ask where that is.
828096	829977	But where is the start key is the question.
830057	831678	Finding is the game, actually.
831718	833399	That's the other game.
833639	834440	That's a scary game.
834600	834860	Yeah.
836301	838982	Since you guys haven't been on the show in a while, we actually have some new listeners.
839042	843224	Believe it or not, people actually subscribe to the show and stay subscribed.
843484	846425	Is it the same five people under different names?
846485	851687	No, we've got emails and people are like, hey, I just started listening and my first show was the fuck show.
851727	852427	And I'm like, really?
852467	854047	And you didn't unsubscribe after that?
854067	855468	I'm like, that's amazing.
855508	856388	You're weird.
856928	861070	So for those that maybe haven't heard you on the show before, what kind of video games are you into?
861090	861870	What do you like to play?
861970	864311	What types of stuff have you been playing right now, Rice Princess?
864891	868675	I don't play anything now except for WoW because I have a love-hate relationship with it.
869175	874921	But I like Super Nintendo games, Nintendo games, older stuff.
875321	875842	Retro stuff?
876082	878805	Yeah, I haven't really played much on the newer gen.
879125	881807	What would you say is a totally underrated retro game?
882448	883609	Clash at Demon Head.
883669	884490	I knew you were going to say that.
884510	885811	Of course you knew I was going to say that.
886392	887613	Why is that game underrated?
887633	889575	Because it's fucking awesome and no one's played it.
890430	895153	Did you get a little hot when you saw that the band in the Scott Pilgrim movie was called Clash of Demon Head?
895293	898815	Yes, because I was probably the only person in the theater who's actually played that game.
899916	900456	It was awesome.
900697	901997	Yes, I liked it a lot.
902057	902478	Good times.
902518	903118	What about you, Eddie?
903138	904079	How about The Doctor?
904339	906120	The Doctor, what types of games have you been playing lately?
906640	910802	You know, not much lately because like the Rice Princess, I own a Wii.
911463	915064	So I'm a very angry Wii player because there's no games for it.
915344	918566	I looked at my Wii history for the past six months and it's just Netflix.
918626	920267	There's no games being played.
920967	926190	But before that, I had downloaded Cave Story on the virtual console, which is a really fun 8-bit style game.
926750	927931	So yeah, I like a lot of old school stuff.
927991	931954	I like the new stuff, I just don't like Halo and Call of Duty and stuff.
932374	935576	So I like adventure type games, and there's not a lot of that on the Wii.
935736	937217	It's mostly a soccer mom console now.
937257	938658	What about Metroid Other M?
938698	940980	That was the big... I've heard terrible reviews on that though.
941120	943341	I want to play it, but I've heard terrible reviews.
943361	944442	I don't know what you guys think.
944822	951366	I'm a little worried, because it's supposed to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, and I've heard a lot of awful things about it, but I've heard some really good things about it, so I don't know.
951427	953708	I've heard play-wise, it's fantastic.
953848	955669	Story-wise, it's balls.
956870	958491	and not the good kind of balls.
958671	959632	Ray D.N.
959712	963614	Silvergun in our chat room says, I get it, says you should get Sin and Punishment 2.
966316	966856	I get it.
967837	968737	How about Sin and Punishment 2?
969057	970238	I don't know what the hell that is.
970338	971219	It's on the Wii.
971279	972980	Okay, I still don't know what it is.
973040	973800	Not you, him.
973920	974400	Oh, fine.
974460	975021	Screw you.
975221	975541	It's for him.
975561	975881	Shooter.
976642	980084	Yeah, it's another shooter, which, you know, I'd play that if I wanted to go to sleep, so.
980684	981645	All right, fine.
982245	988189	I don't trust the industry nowadays because remember how they said Shattered Memories was like the best game at E3?
988890	990571	Fucking worst game ever made.
991432	993593	Oh, I just want to punch Silent Hill.
993613	995074	What was wrong with Silent Hill Shattered Memories?
995295	996135	Everything.
996195	997296	It wasn't a game.
997436	999858	It was just like, here, I'm going to poop on your face.
999878	1001639	E3 game of the year.
1001659	1004461	I don't remember the poop on your face scene, actually.
1004541	1007563	I remember it because that's all that happened over and over.
1007583	1007603	I...
1008524	1011506	I don't... Like, oh my gosh, oh, Alessa, it's you.
1011546	1012767	Boop on your face.
1013628	1015729	It's like, you son of a bitch, you got me again.
1017251	1020293	I thought it was going to be different this time, but no.
1020393	1021794	Did you and I play the same game?
1021834	1024016	Because I just remember the snow and a lot of running.
1024116	1027958	I don't remember... Yeah, you didn't see the tracks of, like, shit everywhere?
1027978	1028979	No, I don't.
1029179	1030240	Okay, yeah.
1030560	1032582	Maybe I got, like, the director's cut or something.
1032682	1036024	I don't know, but I got the shit on your face version.
1036645	1038026	Okay, I'll stop cussing now.
1038326	1038626	All right.
1038806	1039326	No, it's all right.
1039727	1040387	It's a family show.
1041988	1042468	Let's see.
1043528	1044209	My gaming week.
1044229	1044669	Exposure.
1044769	1045389	Exposure.
1045809	1046570	Let's see.
1046710	1048670	What types of stuff did I play this week?
1048750	1049351	Who cares?
1049491	1049691	No.
1050551	1051231	Not a lot of new stuff.
1051251	1051532	Wow.
1051852	1052192	Wow.
1052592	1052932	Wow.
1053292	1054033	I did play WoW.
1054133	1059495	Actually, I played the WoW beta today because I finally got my character to copy over, so I was able to look at the new zones.
1059935	1062136	Have you done any of the sillies or the flirts?
1062776	1064617	They are raunchy!
1064797	1066098	For the new character?
1066158	1068339	Yeah, for goblins and... I haven't.
1068559	1081505	I played a worgen to like level 6, and I got all excited because female worgens showed up like this week, but you can't... You can make one and see what it looks like, but you can't actually click the button that says create the character.
1081525	1083025	Yeah, it says decline or whatever.
1083225	1083826	Yeah, invalid.
1083866	1084486	That's bootsy.
1084506	1084846	Yeah.
1085566	1089347	It's not a PG-13 thing anymore.
1089467	1091928	It's like getting into R-rated material.
1092488	1097430	One of the female goblins, I think it's a flirt, was like, yeah, and then he asked me to go up on him.
1098090	1100591	And I'm just like, what the hell?
1100651	1101631	That's pretty funny.
1101651	1102771	Maybe you're just getting too old.
1102872	1106093	No, but then there was another one where he's like, I've got something for you.
1106193	1108253	And then he just unzips his pants.
1108873	1111694	That's just straight up sexual.
1112514	1114115	That is not teenager stuff.
1114511	1116892	And then Rob was like, let's release the Sassy Squad.
1116973	1117773	He took his pants off.
1117873	1119874	Did I quit playing WoW at the wrong time?
1120615	1121916	I don't have the Sassy Squad anymore.
1121956	1123056	I'm paladin now.
1123076	1123396	I know.
1123617	1124377	Boo.
1124397	1125378	But you have the sassy hair.
1125738	1129480	No, but Alan plays the Boomkin now.
1129540	1130681	So he has a Sassy Squad.
1130701	1131501	That's not what they're called.
1131521	1132962	Not nearly as sassy as your squad.
1133002	1133142	No.
1134603	1136044	He actually is really good.
1136444	1138425	He really is a great Boomkin.
1138666	1139146	He's a big fucking geek.
1139166	1140727	I'm not just saying that because he's listening.
1141107	1143329	He knows what he's doing in that game.
1143470	1143850	I don't know.
1143890	1145171	I just push three buttons.
1145211	1149055	I'm a hunter, you know, but he's like, oh, you just do this to raise your hit cap and blah, blah, blah.
1149095	1149676	I'm like, what?
1151218	1151938	Speak English.
1154821	1161308	Here's the thing is that the beta, I started playing the beta today with my paladin and going into some of the new Love Lady areas.
1161328	1164011	So I went to Mount Hyjal, right, and started fighting some of the new monsters.
1164491	1165592	Wow got hard.
1165732	1166492	It did.
1166752	1171094	Like all of a sudden, like I went from having two heels to having like six.
1171355	1171575	Yeah.
1171615	1173356	And I don't know like which one to cast.
1173696	1178058	And then my rep palette is like all like, oh, now you got to have holy power to do all this shit.
1178258	1179699	And oh my God, they changed everything.
1179759	1180139	It hurts.
1180239	1189682	They did, and Extifer, our buddy Extifer, he tried to heal for one of the raids, and he's like, I couldn't keep anyone above 50% health, and blah, blah, blah.
1189742	1194023	I'm like, I don't really know what that means because I'm not a healer, but that sucks, I guess.
1194504	1194924	I don't know.
1195484	1197865	You make it sound like it's terrible, so I guess it is.
1198005	1200125	But yeah, he was saying it was really hard.
1200165	1201206	But you know what I have?
1201906	1202846	Photon torpedoes.
1204107	1204307	Nice.
1204327	1205667	Well, I've got quantum torpedoes.
1206427	1208048	Actually, I'm using transphasic torpedoes.
1210902	1212463	Why aren't you playing Star Trek Online?
1212523	1214864	Because he doesn't play MMOs.
1214925	1216045	He tried playing WoW for like a week.
1216065	1217306	You know what he did in WoW?
1217686	1224410	He would hide in the Moonwell ponds and do Shadowmeld and when someone would run by he'd go boo and come out of Shadowmeld.
1225011	1227752	That was the extent of his experience in WoW.
1230714	1232355	Why didn't he play on a roleplay server?
1232635	1233216	You know why?
1233236	1235957	Because his computer lagged so hard.
1236038	1238339	He would run in place like eight times and just
1238912	1244257	My computer had like 200 megabytes of RAM, and so it was like I couldn't play WoW, so it was terrible.
1244277	1245197	So that's what I did.
1245638	1249621	You know, I had to upgrade my graphics card and everything to run Star Trek Online decently.
1249881	1250742	Oh, really?
1250782	1251082	Yeah.
1251362	1255726	All right, the chat room's all bitching like, oh, I don't understand what you're talking about.
1255746	1256867	You lost me after Paladin.
1256927	1260550	I'm going to go play Shattered Memories and get shit on my face.
1260830	1261651	So let me move on.
1261671	1262692	Just kidding.
1262932	1266355	And then SSJ100Matt says, at least it's better than Final Fantasy XI.
1267062	1268323	That's totally true.
1268503	1269163	That's not saying much.
1269183	1270824	What about 14, huh?
1271164	1272025	Oh, that gem.
1272065	1272865	Let's not go there.
1273706	1276567	All right, and then I played some iPhone games.
1276627	1281230	Actually, speaking of MMOs, I played a new iPhone MMO that's so much better than the one I played last week.
1281650	1284332	This one is called, I forget the name.
1284392	1285592	It's called Legends.
1286753	1287073	Wow.
1287093	1288874	I think that's short for something else.
1288994	1290815	Player Legends or Play Legends or something.
1290855	1291276	It's free.
1291956	1292396	It's neat.
1292816	1293157	It's got 3D.
1294150	1296213	It sounds unique and not generic at all.
1314574	1316235	Oh my god, it's horrible.
1316795	1324940	Well, I watch Hoarders because A, Alan likes to joke about how that's going to be us in like 20 years, but B, it actually makes me feel better about myself.
1324960	1328782	Because if you'd asked me before I'd watched that show, like, Rob, are you a hoarder?
1328802	1331003	I probably would have said, yeah, I'm a little bit of a hoarder.
1331303	1333905	But after watching that show, I'm like, no, no, absolutely not.
1333925	1334945	Like, oh, hell no.
1335085	1336526	I'd never let it get that bad.
1336706	1339007	Yeah, it's pretty bad on that show.
1339228	1340788	I don't know, you're just getting a little...
1342210	1344053	I'm just saying, I've known you for a while.
1344734	1344994	You know.
1346326	1350368	Some of the things on that show are really, I would never let an animal die under all this stuff.
1350649	1351369	That you know of.
1351729	1352150	I know.
1352170	1352410	All right.
1353270	1353690	Anyhow.
1354551	1356692	This is why Rob doesn't have a kitty.
1357072	1358353	Yeah, or Zach and Kelly.
1358513	1359174	Remember them?
1359514	1360294	That was different.
1360735	1362816	That was different, huh?
1362896	1366598	They didn't die under the weight of crap around the house or anything.
1366658	1369960	They actually had their own little tank that they could swim around in.
1370000	1370660	It's not my fault.
1370961	1373202	One of them decided to swim right up the filter and die.
1373562	1374823	And what happened to the other one?
1375984	1377145	I flushed him down the toilet.
1377165	1377626	I don't remember.
1377906	1379047	Was it alive when you did?
1379308	1379848	No, no.
1379888	1381590	The other one died of sadness.
1383212	1385475	I didn't feed him for a week and he was so sad.
1385555	1386256	He died.
1386936	1392863	Well, I mean, if your little fish friend just decided to seppuku up the filter when you're just... I don't think you seppuku'd.
1392923	1394445	I think you bought the wrong one.
1394485	1395246	You murdered!
1395706	1397947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1425623	1429110	No, I like the Futurama spoof where it was like, here's a twit now.
1430733	1431234	It's true.
1431474	1432977	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1433397	1434219	That's where you can go.
1435521	1435802	Anyhow.
1436363	1438884	I do not have any cute shoes How about video game news?
1439244	1448627	Actual bonafide video game news Because the Tokyo Game Show happened this week So there's a lot of news out of there But we're not starting there tonight, actually What a horrible segue Where are we starting tonight, Loki?
1449567	1463372	Ah, yes, we're starting with This is funny because I could have been affected by this But thanks to procrastination I was not The MMO APB Or what I like to call Grand Theft Auto The MMO
1465013	1485631	It was a cops and robbers MMO game developed by Realtime Worlds who did the wonderful game Crackdown and it launched in the US on June 29th and basically had players playing both the Enforcers and Criminals and...
1487092	1487772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1510343	1521108	Real-time worlds faced massive layoffs last month and I guess before going into administration, which is I guess the UK equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
1523730	1524210	So yeah, the...
1526577	1527718	They weren't doing too well.
1529399	1536663	The quote on the official website is, APB had a fantastic journey, but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end.
1537083	1542626	Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service running, APB is coming to a close.
1543086	1549249	It has been a pleasure working on APB, and with all of its players together, we will be building an absolutely amazing game.
1549790	1553231	Or we were building an absolutely amazing game, and for that we thank you.
1553252	1554052	You guys are awesome.
1554412	1557534	And the thousands of you that paid for this game just got effed in the A, right?
1558795	1559335	Uh, yeah.
1559536	1561317	I'm not hearing a lot about the backlash.
1561337	1563698	I mean, is it just because literally no one bought this game?
1563999	1570183	Or, I mean, it seems so strange to me that an MMO could just get away with shutting down after three months.
1570223	1571604	It wasn't even really an MMO.
1571704	1575886	I mean, it's barely an MMO, especially by today's standards for multiplayer games.
1576427	1581410	I mean, it was 100 player instances, basically, that you got to play in.
1581770	1583351	Can you play it offline, though?
1583732	1583832	No.
1584613	1592642	Well, so if you dropped $60 on this game just three months ago, you paid $20 a month and then some for... Bleh.
1592942	1593183	Yeah.
1594184	1594885	That stinks.
1596873	1600155	I don't know if any of our listeners are the type that get...
1625092	1630376	Loki, you talked about this game an awful lot before it came out, and then you didn't.
1630556	1632077	I mean, did you even get into it?
1632237	1635179	I was in the beta, so I played it for a little bit.
1635879	1636460	It was okay.
1636520	1639782	It was one of those things I didn't want to buy because I didn't think I had time to play it.
1640763	1643404	And if I had, I definitely wouldn't have had time to play it.
1643504	1645926	So that's why I didn't buy it.
1646426	1647547	It was fun to check it out.
1649468	1653291	It's too bad because I think it would have worked better as a console game
1655372	1659455	It's just like something that should have been as a Saints Row type of thing or something like that.
1660276	1672484	Have the actual main storyline and everything and have some really fleshed out online mode where you can play either the cops or the enforcers and level up and have a really cool character editor and stuff like that.
1673204	1675406	That's what I could have saw this being, but it wasn't.
1677207	1684672	However, all may not be lost because apparently Epic Games is interested in buying the rights to the game.
1686093	1689835	So maybe we'll see APB come back in some other form.
1691095	1691676	Be interesting.
1693517	1706324	I guess Eurogamer was reporting this, saying that according to the BBC, sourced close to the development team, a few companies are showing interest in picking up APB's rights.
1707324	1710406	And apparently one of those companies is Epic Games.
1711406	1714228	Of course, the company behind the Gears of War and Unreal Tournament series.
1715028	1728973	And also adding to the speculation, Eurogamer, they were citing Dundee Development Source, in real time, I guess was based in Dundee, Scotland, that Dave Jones, the real time world's boss...
1729853	1735377	and Epic is quite the talking point in the town.
1735517	1745024	He says he and Mr. Rain are good chums and have worked together on many levels for years and years and years and he's not going to raise much money and staff here in the near future.
1747296	1749317	It's sounding like that maybe Epic will buy them.
1750297	1755458	I guess that's good, but still, I mean, what type of precedence is this set for the future?
1755498	1762360	Like, I'm still just picturing, you know, thousands, or well, at least hundreds of angry gamers that bought this game.
1762760	1763800	Tens of angry gamers.
1763840	1769402	Tens of angry gamers that bought this game that feel really screwed about it closing.
1770002	1770482	You know what I mean?
1773638	1776800	This is the first time this has ever happened on The Sims that the shirt just disappears.
1776880	1781582	DarkSakura doesn't prefer to actually listen to the show when it's going on.
1781702	1785644	She plays The Sims while the show's going on and we all look over there.
1785664	1788305	At the same time, don't know why, we just all kind of look over at her computer.
1788345	1795809	She's dressing some character right now and it's a female character she's dressing and we look over there and no top, no top on, just titties hanging out.
1797603	1799645	What kind of game are you playing over there?
1799705	1803048	Oh no, I tried to change her shirt and all of a sudden her boobs just pop out.
1804169	1805009	That's what happens.
1807691	1811495	Question in our chatroom at chat.orangelaundry.com or more of a statement from our buddy Seg.
1811515	1812676	I haven't seen him in chat in forever.
1812696	1814397	Hi Seg.
1814837	1818080	Watch it become like Uru missed online and never die.
1818460	1821243	Missed online got resurrected about three or four times.
1821923	1822384	That's true.
1823092	1823672	It would be neat.
1823692	1824193	It was alright.
1824253	1828195	But once again, you know, doing 100 player instances is not really an MMO.
1828215	1829675	I mean, look at MAG.
1829875	1835258	I mean, that's, I think, what, got 128 players at a time?
1835718	1836959	And they all call it an MMO.
1837099	1840861	They call it like an MMO action game, I guess, or something like that.
1841101	1848808	I think this is all an elaborate scheme to justify the online pass because the people who made this game didn't charge for the online pass, did they?
1849228	1853512	And so they're going to say, well, because we weren't charging the $10 premium, we had to shut down the servers.
1853532	1854473	But that doesn't make any sense.
1854573	1858096	Why would they charge for an online pass if they're charging for online anyways?
1858457	1859017	Oh, I'm sorry.
1859037	1860819	They don't have a used market for PC titles.
1860839	1861539	Well, why not?
1861599	1862881	What's stopping them these days?
1863161	1863521	I'm sorry.
1863561	1864882	You got to pay another $10 for online access.
1867004	1868866	I can't play without online access.
1869046	1869947	That's too bad.
1870127	1880194	You know, every time we play these games, especially the online ones, we have to accept terms of conditions, a user agreement, basically, right?
1880715	1885318	When are we going to make the company sign the company agreement when we buy their games?
1886179	1891663	If I plop $60 on this game, you need to keep the damn servers up for at least a year or X, Y, Z.
1894329	1903568	Unrealistic, yes, but I just think this is a bad precedence if this just kind of slips away and people are just like, oh, well, it was a crappy game anyway.
1905675	1905995	Oh well.
1906455	1913957	I think they should get their money back, or people that bought it should get their money back, but unfortunately the company has no money to give back, so... Oh well.
1915497	1915877	Too bad.
1917238	1917698	Live and learn.
1918138	1922799	Maybe if you have one of those Best Buy replacement plans, you can go take the game back and say it don't work no more.
1923779	1924159	I don't know.
1924239	1924579	Good luck.
1925360	1926060	We'll see if that works.
1927300	1933143	Something that might have worked a little better had it come out would have been this patent that was discovered by Sony last week.
1933184	1935725	It was a last-gen console adapter.
1937146	1944810	Could explain why there was never PS2 backwards compatibility after, of course, the very, very first PlayStation 3 console.
1945190	1947832	It was removed from the console pretty quickly to help cut down on cost.
1948192	1952594	Then there were rumors that it was going to come out on the download service, the PlayStation Network.
1952614	1955416	We would see PlayStation 2 games, but that never seemed to happen either.
1956056	1972031	Well, apparently one of the tech sites over in Japan, Gigazine, discovered a patent that was filed by Sony Japan back in February of 2009, which described an adapter, and it would serve as a bridge for older gen games to be played on a current gen console.
1972392	1978077	And honestly, when I look at the picture, it looks like you are attaching a PlayStation 2 to your PlayStation 3.
1978157	1980179	That is retarded.
1980720	1980980	Yep.
1982241	1983803	Is it bad I still kind of want one?
1984263	1984864	No, no, no.
1985264	1986145	Here's what they would do, too.
1986225	1987046	They would charge like $150 for that.
1987086	1989609	Even though the PS2 is $100.
1989649	1991110	Yeah, exactly.
1991671	1992592	Because they don't learn.
1992652	1995915	It's just like, you know, oh, hey, we're going to release this system.
1995955	1997297	We're going to call it the PSP Go.
1997937	2011363	and yeah we know that the regular PSP is out right now for like $150 and that it can play UMD discs but this new PSP that we're releasing it's not going to be able to play UMD discs you're going to have to download all your tiles oh and we're going to charge $200 for it oh I'm sorry no $250 for it
2014111	2014712	Smart.
2014932	2017254	Now, something to keep in mind, just to be technical.
2017294	2018015	Oh, and a PS3.
2018035	2018355	That's only $2.99.
2018395	2023159	The patent doesn't specifically say it's for PlayStation 2 games.
2023860	2026002	It's just for older games.
2026122	2030766	But if you think about it, okay, PlayStation 3 already plays PlayStation 1 games.
2031327	2031827	No, no, no.
2031887	2034289	You need this additional adapter to play.
2034309	2039154	No, it's going to play Dreamcast games and Sega CD games.
2039674	2041455	It plays HD DVD.
2041555	2041956	Who knew?
2042136	2042676	Wow.
2042736	2044177	That's backwards compatible.
2044557	2044878	All right.
2044918	2046299	So, yeah.
2046699	2049341	It doesn't sound like this would be too incredibly popular if it came out.
2049441	2049821	I don't know.
2050401	2053023	If it was the right price, I'd probably buy it.
2053143	2053703	You know why?
2053804	2055665	To save on the shelf space.
2056305	2059467	Because I don't... How do you figure?
2059747	2064911	Because if I have to get a PlayStation 2 out to hook up, that's a whole other AC adapter.
2064931	2066992	That's a whole other set of RGB cords.
2067012	2069054	That's a whole other... Girlfriend, you just lazy.
2069974	2071135	You... Yeah, pretty much.
2071155	2071515	Lazy.
2071595	2072216	Pretty much.
2072416	2072976	Actually, you're wrong.
2073016	2074978	It's not another set of RGB courts.
2075098	2077920	It's actually the exact same set.
2078000	2080141	But you have to move it from the PS3 to PS2.
2080321	2080662	You know what?
2080682	2082303	They probably just spypainted a PS2.
2082323	2083484	Well, that's definitely worth $150.
2083524	2083904	It is.
2084544	2087707	They're just like, oh, let's change this to an off-gray.
2088127	2090088	Or you can spend, I don't know, $10...
2092930	2093651	Thank you for watching!
2116455	2120238	This Screeching Hall was brought to you by DarkSakura and her lovely insights.
2123641	2126403	What if it like up-res the resolution of the game?
2126503	2129025	Yeah, that'd be so amazing.
2129325	2130786	If only a console did that already.
2130987	2133188	Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3 does.
2133228	2134770	That's so crazy.
2134790	2135630	But not for PS2 games.
2136271	2139013	It did if you got one of the launch systems.
2139033	2139794	Well, too bad...
2140274	2141895	Not a lot of people bought one of the launches.
2141915	2143937	Well, you should have done that.
2144257	2145638	Lower your standards.
2145658	2147960	Give me $700 or whatever the hell those things cost back then.
2147980	2148581	They were crazy.
2148601	2148921	$599 US dollars.
2148941	2149041	Well.
2154246	2154666	I don't know.
2155227	2156087	Alright, I'm over it.
2156107	2158628	You guys are mean.
2158648	2165012	The best part about that though is I have one of those systems that plays PlayStation 2 games and I don't play any PlayStation 2 games in it at all.
2165032	2171175	I would play Final Fantasy 12, .hack because I never did beat it, and Magic Pen Gel.
2171315	2173156	But don't you have a PS2 already?
2173616	2174737	In a box somewhere.
2174757	2177999	We've used ours to play PS2 games.
2179434	2181375	I don't want to actually look for my PS2.
2181395	2184517	I'm going to go buy this thing for my PS3.
2184537	2185498	You don't understand.
2185618	2186439	No, I don't.
2187900	2189901	A, there's no guarantee the PS2 still works.
2190401	2194724	B, it's a whole other set of cords that you have to hook into the back of the TV.
2194824	2196465	God, you must be the laziest person.
2196485	2199786	There's no guarantee that it works, so I'm not even going to try.
2199966	2203587	I'm just going to drop this hundred whatever the fuck dollars on this thing.
2203647	2209269	You were here the other week when we had the 32X hooked up, and that's a whole bunch of cables.
2209949	2210470	Thanks for watching!
2233431	2244719	I think that my TV has something like three HDMI things and then a bunch of AV and like some S-video and like the little one that you use the switch for.
2245019	2245660	Well, that's nice.
2245680	2247021	My TV is from Costco.
2247121	2248401	So is ours.
2248662	2250263	Our TV is from Costco.
2250603	2252284	That is not a valid excuse.
2252424	2254746	I rendered your excuse invalid.
2254786	2257368	I swear my thing only has like two inputs and an HDMI.
2257388	2258148	Well, yours sucks.
2258168	2258889	You should return it.
2259489	2261632	I'm sorry that your thing only has two inputs.
2264495	2265276	Next story!
2267358	2270762	Well, how about some more PS3 news?
2271143	2274006	There is going to be a new system update 3.42.
2274527	2277470	Why can't they just give them regular numbers instead of points?
2278331	2279952	Why can't it be update number 4?
2280212	2280693	Update number 5?
2281053	2281113	No.
2281133	2283154	Because right now they'd be at update number 62.
2283574	2284495	They're bitches.
2284515	2289558	Because the whole number updates are for major, major, major updates.
2289618	2291920	And this is just, hey, we're adding Blu-ray.
2292800	2294161	Well, the next one is 3.5.
2294701	2296102	Because we just got 3.42.
2297623	2303567	And this one is going to add 3D Blu-ray movie support since it can already do 3D with games.
2305048	2316356	And that date is actually out for the Japanese market on September 21st, but I guess it's going to be after?
2317236	2317816	Are you screw driving?
2317836	2318256	He's screwing me.
2318276	2318776	Are you screw driving?
2340922	2341903	That's not a Sony TV.
2342503	2343624	I'm getting you a Sony TV.
2344024	2345085	And it's going to be a 3D TV.
2345406	2347047	Tell your Sony rep to get me a TV.
2347067	2348228	Do you watch Avatar?
2348848	2349929	No, we can't.
2350029	2352191	That's not 3D Blu-ray.
2352211	2357815	Because that will be in the super extended Uber James Cameron's cock Blu-ray edition.
2357915	2358536	Well, okay.
2358636	2361698	Until then, though, all we have is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
2361718	2364980	That's seriously the only damn movie that's in 3D.
2365101	2366702	Which is also James Cameron's cock.
2369438	2371359	Just, by the way, don't watch... It's meaty balls.
2371379	2372720	Cloudy with a chance of balls.
2374141	2374702	Cameron balls.
2375662	2379565	Don't watch Resident Evil Afterlife, and especially don't watch it in 3D.
2381901	2382762	It was awesome.
2382822	2383903	Why didn't you like that?
2383923	2384663	I wanted to see it.
2384704	2385444	You're kidding, right?
2385484	2386365	No, I liked it.
2386985	2387866	You're being facetious.
2387906	2388927	Tell me you're being facetious.
2388947	2389567	I'm not being facetious.
2389587	2389868	Tell me.
2389908	2390928	My head's going to explode.
2390989	2391289	No.
2392430	2397314	That would be one of the only movies that I would actually want to go see in 3D because you know it's going to be ridiculous.
2397354	2400496	You know it's just like going to an amusement park.
2400656	2400916	Okay.
2401357	2402418	What did you not like about it?
2403530	2406834	Well, okay, the movie itself was fucking ridiculous and stupid.
2407334	2410057	The 3D was obviously the added-on 3D.
2410298	2411239	It wasn't shot in 3D.
2411279	2412160	It was shot in 3D.
2412320	2412740	It was?
2412821	2416885	Yeah, they actually, even when they were writing the script, they were writing with 3D in mind.
2416925	2419648	When they were writing the script of Dawn of the Dead.
2419989	2421931	They used the same cameras as Avatar did.
2421971	2422752	It was this big deal.
2422952	2423492	Wow.
2424112	2431934	No, but, okay, we actually, we went and saw that, I went and saw that actually on, uh, last week, um, with the D-Box seats.
2431954	2435335	I don't know if you've heard about those, the motion seats that actually move and rumble and stuff.
2435775	2436755	It was cool, okay?
2436795	2438515	Well, that might have added to it.
2438615	2450238	And here's the thing, though, I don't really play the Resident Evil games, so for me, this movie was kind of like, hey, look, it's almost like The Matrix, but not, you know, so I don't know if the storyline ruined it for you, because I couldn't care, you know?
2450298	2452138	Yes, the storyline was stupid, and
2452538	2458100	Okay, the extent of the 3D stuff was just, oh, look at this blood flying in your face.
2458320	2459320	Oh, look at this building.
2459380	2462061	It's crumbling and some of the crumbles are falling in your face.
2462361	2464242	There was nothing exciting about it.
2464282	2468403	Maybe I'm just an old crotchety woman that doesn't like 3D, which is entirely possible.
2468423	2469483	There was a lot of gimmicky stuff in there.
2469563	2470123	It was stupid shit, man.
2470143	2471984	A lot of throwing stuff at the camera.
2472084	2472184	Yeah.
2472364	2474625	Hey, I'm throwing my glasses at the camera.
2474665	2475965	I'm throwing my axe at the camera.
2476166	2479827	No, but that's like one of the only movies that I would go, okay, that's in 3D, that makes sense.
2479847	2482708	But like, Eat, Pray, Love, I mean, that doesn't need to be in 3D.
2483748	2484629	Was that really in 3D?
2484669	2487270	I'm gonna pray.
2488550	2491371	And I was extending my folded hands forward.
2492512	2494653	No, and just the movie itself was really stupid.
2494693	2499435	Like, literally, it was Dawn of the Dead, except with Resident Evil people.
2499455	2499935	Spoilers.
2500575	2501456	Oh my god.
2502296	2503397	You've seen it before.
2503477	2507319	Didn't we go through this whole 3D craze back in the 80s with like Jaws 3D?
2507440	2507840	I don't know.
2509081	2509881	I was like five.
2510341	2516305	Well, I think, okay, right now in Sony, they were kind of bad for doing it.
2518066	2522409	The PlayStation 3 when it first came out was like $600, and they're like, well, that's because it has Blu-ray in it.
2522789	2525331	Well, everyone complained, I don't give a fuck, it's $600.
2526191	2526891	I'm not buying it.
2527672	2531274	It's because they're kind of jumping, they're trying to push the technology too much.
2531494	2546483	Just like 3D TV, I'm glad you're supporting 3D with your games, and I'm glad you're supporting 3D Blu-ray, because probably you have a little bit of an investment in it, since, I don't know, you have a lot of Blu-ray stuff, you are your own movie company and whatnot.
2547223	2568910	um so obviously they're trying to invest some of that in there but it's really not viable now to buy a 3d tv or a 3d blu-ray player because there's hardly any content for it and if you just wait it's gonna get damn cheaper anyways and there's probably something better gonna come out you know they're gonna come out with tvs that don't require stupid glasses on you
2569170	2580223	Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop is in chat and follows up the comment about Eat, Pray, Love in 3D saying Julia Roberts' mouth in 3D would be a sin of technology.
2580243	2582385	See 3D birds.
2584347	2588530	There's this picture I sometimes see on Oh No They Didn't and somebody needs to link it in chat.
2588790	2590351	Alan, find this picture.
2590771	2597295	It's a picture of Julia Roberts but it's been photoshopped to really exaggerate her horse mouth and it's really scary.
2597335	2599196	It makes her look like a zombie in Resident Evil.
2599216	2601598	She already has an exaggerated horse mouth.
2601658	2602818	I don't want to see the picture.
2602838	2603359	It's so scary.
2603379	2604279	Don't do it, Alan.
2605760	2606521	Somebody will find it for me.
2607221	2609722	SSJ100Matt says Rob's still waiting for Showgirls 3D.
2610763	2611464	True story.
2611644	2613526	Actually, you want to hear a true story?
2614267	2616829	I bought Showgirls on Blu-ray this week for $18.
2616909	2617490	It was on sale.
2617510	2618110	That's awesome.
2619672	2621173	I want to go watch it.
2622255	2623896	I should come over and we should have a Showgirls party.
2624036	2624577	Let's do it.
2624957	2626459	I want to watch the TV version.
2626559	2628661	And we'll have brown rice and vegetables, Rob.
2631284	2632665	We'll have a whole little Showgirls party.
2632685	2633165	It'll be fun.
2633506	2633806	Yay.
2635083	2637264	That is seriously a movie that needs to be in 3D though.
2638044	2642327	No, not Eat, Pray, Love.
2642607	2643307	Showgirls.
2643707	2646208	Yeah, yeah, Showgirls.
2646689	2647349	Not striptease.
2647489	2648269	No one wants to see that.
2648309	2649890	I want Saved by the Bell 3D then.
2650491	2653792	No, because they had, was it the Piranha 3D or whatever?
2653812	2657734	And they had a whole bunch of like, oh, it's wet t-shirt contest type stuff.
2658314	2660275	So we need more of that with less of the piranhas.
2660315	2663697	I mean, the piranhas are cool and all, but you don't need to mix them both together.
2663965	2668550	Yeah, like Nomi's nipples are going to be coming out into your face.
2668650	2672033	But can you imagine, you know, the really weird thrash sex she was doing?
2672073	2673174	You know, that in 3D?
2673194	2674255	That'd be some scary stuff.
2674275	2675196	That would be scary.
2675276	2678219	People would be like, ah, what the fuck is that?
2678259	2679120	You gonna die?
2680381	2682324	Watch, I know what's happening in this movie.
2682344	2682945	You going down.
2683266	2685108	Ah, Rob, close it now.
2685188	2685789	I hate it.
2686971	2689354	Ah, times a million.
2689955	2692118	I found the picture I was looking for, or one of them.
2692219	2693220	Oh, my God.
2693761	2694462	Hold on.
2694782	2695822	This is terrible radio.
2696583	2697843	Let me leave this nerd chat room.
2697903	2698943	What is going on?
2699403	2702024	I don't know, but I lost the don't shit my pants game.
2702524	2704705	Why is that like Enzyte guy there?
2705325	2706106	No.
2707166	2707786	Cover it up.
2707866	2709627	Cover it up with that window.
2709727	2710507	Move it, Rob.
2710567	2710767	Don't.
2711567	2711867	Thank you.
2711887	2712407	Just Google.
2712828	2713628	Okay, or not Google.
2713648	2718489	Go to Photobucket because they let you search your pictures and search for Julia Roberts GIF.
2719090	2720030	Julia Roberts GIF.
2720470	2721990	And it will come right up.
2722050	2722851	It's like the first image.
2722931	2723611	It's hilarious.
2726354	2726794	Let's see.
2728856	2733139	Spazinator PSN says, I wouldn't mind seeing Angelina Jolie's boobs in 3D.
2733179	2733700	Just saying.
2734800	2739184	You know, Wanted might have been kind of cool in 3D because they tried to do some 3D-ish kind of things in that.
2739204	2740865	You know, I could see that working.
2740985	2748491	You know, and with a movie like that, that's just like, this movie is like so hetero, it's dick has a dick, like type of thing.
2748611	2749412	Yeah, that's weird.
2749432	2750692	That's not very hetero right there.
2751173	2753074	I would not fuck a dick that had a dick.
2753134	2754195	That would be awkward.
2754215	2755236	That's something right out of the...
2756756	2760177	Yeah, I'm like, I gotta go now away from your dick.
2760357	2761337	You know what I mean, though?
2761957	2762678	I guess.
2763038	2766358	That would be weird if the bullets went around your face in 3D.
2766698	2769339	Ah, I almost got shot.
2770759	2771039	Yeah.
2771199	2771879	You know what I'm gonna do?
2771899	2774200	I'm gonna post that Julia Roberts gift to our Twitter.
2774420	2776340	Oh my god.
2776380	2777781	Move past it, Rob.
2777841	2781381	I'm gonna see who's not listening to the show right now by seeing the responses we get.
2781841	2782242	Okay.
2783222	2784222	And in the meantime...
2785134	2785634	Did it work?
2787316	2792099	So, back to the Doctor and Vice Princess show.
2792239	2792979	Sorry.
2794000	2798423	Well, now that we're done with that topic, let's talk about Halo Reach and its shortcomings.
2798983	2804967	Halo Reach is an awesome game, but somebody didn't test it well enough, and that somebody would be Microsoft.
2805828	2811670	Halo Reach has problems playing on the brand new 4GB Xbox 360 Slimmer system.
2812950	2819392	It's funny because apparently co-op requires a hard drive in order to work, which is dumb to begin with.
2821113	2827535	The 4GB of storage that's on those new systems is kind of classified as a memory unit.
2827975	2833857	So therefore, despite the fact that you have adequate space to store whatever files they want you to store...
2834517	2834957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2853615	2854896	You have to play with yourself.
2855057	2860583	Apparently, though, Microsoft has said that they're aware of the issue and this is going to be a temporary issue.
2860603	2862144	The company is working to resolve it.
2862685	2864607	But seriously, come on, man.
2864647	2866709	That should have been something that you should have tested first.
2866769	2872616	Let's try playing this on each of our SKUs, especially the ones that have just come out, and let's see if it works correctly.
2874415	2877337	One of the biggest games for our company.
2877357	2878957	That might be important to do.
2880458	2880978	Just a little bit.
2882539	2886021	Or maybe they're just trying to upsell those bigger console bundles.
2886081	2896767	Yeah, let me buy your stupid 4GB system and then I have to buy a really expensive hard drive to plug into it because normal hard drives won't work.
2897787	2899448	Despite the fact that it's a normal hard drive.
2901089	2902391	but formatted differently.
2903773	2903993	Fun.
2904934	2905234	Totally.
2905295	2911042	Why can't you just allow anybody to put their own hard drives in there?
2911543	2912524	Just like Sony.
2913325	2914647	At least they have that going for them.
2917378	2925302	Alright, well I'm going to move on to another story here about a website called Good Old Games and a lot of interesting developments that's going on today.
2925602	2932245	And you know, after hearing about the developments, I kind of hesitate even bringing up this story on the show in the first place, but it's kind of bold what's going on.
2933385	2938227	Good Old Games is a website located at GOG.com, and we brought them up on the show before.
2938648	2950032	It's a website where you can buy old games, like the King's Quest series, and just old PC games from back in the day for $5 or $10, and it's all DRM-free.
2950433	2953214	Like Fallout 2, just older PC games.
2953574	2955955	So it's kind of like legalized abandonware, basically.
2956215	2983176	You know, for companies that still want to sell their old games Well, they shut down today and posted a notice on their website that says We recently had to give serious thought as to whether we could really keep GOG.com going the way it is We've debated on it for quite some time and unfortunately we've decided that GOG.com simply cannot remain in its current form So the website, you know, a lot of news sites kind of post about this Oh, this is such a good idea, you know, it made this thing legal and, you know, it was good karma to buy the games and stuff
2983916	3005188	and now they've shut down oh it's a bummer to see them go but now it's coming out today did they really shut down or is this all a marketing ploy and that is apparently the latest news that is coming out is that this is actually a marketing ploy about their change from the beta version of GOG.com to the full version of GOG.com
3006188	3025883	And in an article that Kotaku ran, they actually got an update from spokesman Tom Ole Well, he's kind of an a-hole if this whole thing turns out to be true Saying, quote, as the message on the site says, this doesn't mean that GOG is gone We'll have more to share in the coming days
3026724	3027565	Hmm.
3027965	3028746	It's kind of bootsy.
3028926	3029586	I don't like that.
3050262	3079317	well what's interesting is that now the whole thing might have actually been a media hoax so on one hand you gotta kinda go lol that's funny good job you got the press but on the other hand to your loyal customers who are kinda freaking out about are the games I bought still gonna work how am I gonna re-download these games you know your core fanbase is gonna feel a little bit used after something like this so it's like yes you get the exposure but at what cost I felt very used on Rob's network have you ever bought a game on good old games I didn't think so
3081658	3086623	Yeah, SpazinatorPSN in our chatroom says, good old games, bad old decisions.
3087884	3089305	And that could be accurate.
3090686	3093429	So... You alright?
3093999	3095380	Yes, nothing happened at all.
3095981	3096922	Yes, we're good over here.
3096982	3097662	Good, good to hear it.
3097942	3099784	The cord definitely didn't fall out of the microphone.
3099824	3101365	Nope, nope, it stayed intact.
3101445	3101806	Wow.
3103367	3104688	Loki, what do you think?
3104768	3110072	I mean, I know you probably weren't a big advocate of this site in the first place, but what do you think about this as a marketing trick?
3110173	3111113	As a marketing trick?
3112775	3117238	That's cool that we're all talking about you, and then when you come back, you're like, ah, no, we're not really going away.
3117258	3119881	Everyone's like, okay, no, we're not talking about you anymore.
3119901	3120301	No one cares.
3121172	3141111	I'm I think it's in terms of marketing because keep in mind there is no such thing as bad press really yeah it gets people talking here's my suggestion and I know there's a handful of sites out there that listen to our show for inspiration I'm sure not to trash us on their blog every week but here's the thing
3142312	3156661	If you cover the story about them shutting down and you want to really get revenge on these guys and their little marketing tricks and how they're using you basically to get free advertising for their site, cover the story about them shutting down and don't cover the story about them reopening.
3157041	3158442	And then punch them in the dick.
3159882	3161303	And the guy will be like, Olay!
3162464	3162864	My dick.
3162944	3163465	If you want.
3164685	3165506	But no, seriously.
3166046	3169128	Because if nobody covers the story about them reopening...
3170996	3173698	This little marketing thing kind of bit him in the ass, didn't it?
3174738	3175399	Food for thought.
3176379	3183623	I know if I ran a website such as the aforementioned Kotaku or Joystick, I just wouldn't run... I would say, you know, I'm not your little...
3185416	3188357	I'm not to be toyed with I'm not to be toyed with
3210171	3211271	Hey!
3211351	3211772	Hey!
3213612	3214352	Wow, Rob.
3214392	3215353	Bend over, shark.
3215813	3216933	That doesn't show your age.
3217693	3219934	DarkSakura, please, won't you help us change the subject?
3220134	3222435	Well, there are other subjects, definitely.
3223075	3226776	It was spoken, actually, it came up on Twitter.
3228417	3237639	Katsuhiro Harada, who is the Tekken director guy, he posted on Twitter, TGS September 18th at Togeki booth, I'll announce something.
3238880	3239240	Colon D.
3241036	3241616	Smileface.
3242817	3245758	And we actually don't know what it is yet.
3246438	3247939	It's second tag tournament two.
3249959	3250199	Sorry.
3253721	3253941	Yuck.
3255836	3257598	Are you not excited about Tekken Tag Tournament 2?
3257778	3260200	I wasn't excited about the first Tekken Tag Tournament.
3260440	3261801	No, I think that's what it ended up being.
3262442	3263262	Yeah, he's right.
3263403	3264624	You know, I still have to play it.
3265084	3265925	Because it's Tekken.
3266365	3266705	Sorry.
3268147	3274612	Well, I mean, wasn't there like in the 3D Street Fighter series, didn't you not like the first game but the second one was okay?
3275093	3275493	Things like that.
3275513	3276354	And the EX ones?
3276394	3276634	Yeah.
3278515	3279236	They're alright.
3280097	3282519	I'm just not a big fan of the Tekken Tag Series.
3284693	3285614	Whoa, your mic cut out.
3285674	3287275	Sorry, I didn't even realize we just had big dead air.
3287355	3288215	Sorry about that.
3289216	3289476	Okay.
3289796	3290357	So Tekken Tag.
3290717	3291217	Tekken Tag.
3291357	3296260	If it's better than the first one, then yeah, I won't be disappointed.
3296320	3296780	But I don't know.
3296800	3298822	The first one was really not all that great.
3299322	3300223	Except for Tekken Bowl.
3300663	3302044	Well, here's my thoughts on it.
3302264	3313531	It's probably just going to be, since they're developing a tag team tournament sort of engine for Tekken X Capcom, the Namco version of that,
3314031	3315192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3331099	3332200	Yeah, it is.
3333120	3336563	And apparently that game will be hitting Japanese arcades in 2011.
3337003	3350013	And it is an updated, I guess it is a follow-up, of course, to 1999's arcade original, updated with new roster and current-gen graphics engine.
3350553	3352315	Doesn't say the U.S.
3352395	3356378	version has been announced yet, but they have a nice little teaser trailer that's up right now.
3356618	3358139	What do you know they're going to have a US version?
3358199	3361480	Well, and if this is an arcade game, that's kind of good news, I guess.
3361540	3365641	We've had a few stories in the past few weeks about good news for arcade games, you know?
3366362	3372404	Like they're getting some things that the consoles actually don't have just yet, although it's probably inevitable this comes out for consoles as well.
3373564	3377245	Well, I hope it does, but I would really like to see.
3378366	3381347	If it did get an arcade release in the US, you know I'd play it.
3382216	3389720	Like I said, I don't think if it does come out console-wise, it's not going to take that long to port it over.
3389760	3396524	Because, like I said, they're building an engine already for the Tekken X Capcom game.
3396784	3400026	Or Street Fighter, I guess.
3402037	3403799	It's going to be the same damn engine, I know it.
3404119	3408844	SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom, says it actually looks like the same system as Tekken across Capcom.
3409304	3425300	Yeah, see, that's the sad thing, though, is since they have that game coming out, it's like, you know, I could play that game, but I'd rather play the Capcom one, or not the Capcom, the Street Fighter one, because it's got more variety of characters, and now you have this one.
3425620	3427723	I just hope they don't bring it out on console.
3427763	3429485	Just leave it in the arcade or something.
3429505	3432029	But put all the characters though in the Street Fighter one too.
3432169	3432770	So that would be kind of cool.
3433720	3439202	All right, let's travel around the world and talk about some games that are coming out a whole lot sooner than Tekken Tag Tournament.
3439323	3441764	This week, not a whole lot coming out in the U.S.
3442064	3444165	It's actually pretty light, but next week will be pretty nice.
3444965	3447166	Starting off, though, this week we have Swords on the Wii.
3447646	3448847	It is a sword fighting game.
3450227	3454589	Looks like a re-release of a game called Chicken Blaster with a stupid shotgun with that.
3455170	3455430	Fun.
3455450	3456750	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3458431	3459752	Is it a chicken fighting game?
3476502	3477103	How could you?
3477263	3478244	You're wrong, sir.
3478464	3478784	You are wrong.
3478804	3479865	You just need Chicken Shooter.
3480566	3481887	Chicken Blaster, okay.
3481967	3482948	Chicken Shoot was the first game.
3483009	3484330	Chicken Blaster with your small shotgun.
3484350	3485971	Get it right.
3486592	3489795	Sid Meier's Civilization V coming out on PC.
3489955	3490316	Yay.
3491677	3496061	New Carnival games on the DS and the Wii.
3496222	3497523	Yay.
3498324	3498984	Looks like, what was it?
3502253	3530578	WorldGolf2011, that's also on PC, um, Patrician, I think that's, um, Patrician4 on PC, I have no idea what the hell that is, uh, Formula 1 2010, coming from, well, what was formerly Codemasters, now Warner Home Video Games, that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week, uh, let's see,
3532118	3549679	Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue on the DS a tie in with the new movie coming out whoopty shit come on OLR listeners how many of you bought Fancy Nancy last week that's what I want to know ah Sony once again not quite getting it but high velocity bowling for Playstation 3
3550700	3551700	High Velocity Bullying.
3551760	3557883	Yes, you may remember this as the PlayStation Network title that came out originally at $10, probably now $5.
3558843	3559503	But hey, guess what?
3559523	3561544	You're going to pay $40 for this one now.
3561604	3562944	But this one has move support, right?
3563004	3564305	It does have move support.
3564465	3567366	But I think the old one was getting patched for move support, I think.
3567766	3571307	I could be wrong, but that would be ironic if that was the case.
3572228	3577309	Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allan Poe conspiracy for the DS.
3577349	3577569	What?
3579190	3579991	Farm Frenzy.
3580071	3580572	You know what?
3580672	3584216	I was about to make the same joke I know I made on this show like four weeks ago.
3584276	3589761	So this game had to have gotten pushed back because I was going to say, I will buy that game, Quoth the Raven, nevermore.
3590182	3590602	No.
3590783	3594406	I know I made that joke four weeks ago and you all groaned then too.
3594767	3595488	I'm leaving.
3596629	3608681	Farm Frenzy, Animal Country Club Penguin, Game Day for the Wii Gormiti, The Lords of Nature Jewels of the Tropical Lost Island
3617310	3619912	God, this game list is shitty as fuck, man.
3619932	3625675	This is the great thing, is that Loki, like whenever we do the US release dates, he'll be like, yeah, you know, Halo's coming out this week.
3625715	3628597	And then we have on the DS, Fancy Nancy.
3630118	3635121	And it looks like we've got Jewel Questathon and Chicken Shoots coming out on the Wii.
3635381	3636782	No, but that's my point, though.
3636842	3640544	I've been waiting for like two years for like good games to start coming out on the Wii again.
3640584	3642525	And I'm like, okay, Zelda's coming out next year.
3642765	3643265	You know what?
3643365	3645847	You can come over and play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom with me.
3646850	3647490	Well, that's on the Wii.
3647510	3648510	Yeah, I played that.
3648610	3649190	That's a fun game.
3649310	3651031	What about Epic Yarn?
3651671	3652511	Well, that's not out yet.
3652571	3653151	See, that's what I mean.
3653171	3654971	That's not out yet, and that looks like a good game.
3655012	3655272	Shut up.
3655312	3656852	That does not sound like Fancy Nancy.
3656912	3658972	But before that, Wii Party.
3659412	3666674	Did you see that they actually got the idea for the Kirby game from an old Kirby commercial that Nintendo had made using Yarn?
3666714	3673815	There is some decent stuff coming out this week, and we're also going to end with some crappy stuff, as if we haven't already.
3675475	3695525	Etrian Odyssey 3 The Drowned City on DS Final Fantasy 14 The Collector's Edition coming out on PC this week I think you get that earlier than the regular version I guess that's special Wait, and how much are you going to pay for Final Fantasy 14 to play it early?
3695545	3697666	$75 Good lord!
3699907	3701008	That's a lot of money
3702569	3706254	Also this week, Darksiders on PC.
3710333	3711214	And I believe that's it.
3733385	3734746	Can I take a tangent for a minute?
3735046	3739248	Tangent train, this actually absolutely 100% has nothing to do with video games whatsoever.
3739988	3741028	But it does have to do with strippers.
3741269	3742369	Okay, yes, you can.
3742409	3750413	So, I went out clubbing last night with Alan and we met some mutual friends and met up for dinner and went to one of the bars downtown.
3750793	3755395	And we were sitting at a table that is right by the window.
3756195	3758498	So you can look out onto the street and see what's going on.
3759138	3759799	And we watched this.
3760179	3771551	There's a really popular gay bar across the street where all the little circuit boys and all their little women that want to go see the horny guys and stuff.
3771671	3774654	That's the club they all go to that I outgrew many, many, many years ago.
3774674	3775635	I know what you're talking about.
3775655	3776957	Yes, you know exactly which place I'm talking about.
3776997	3778759	Anyone who lives in Sacramento knows what club I'm talking about.
3779179	3800789	so we are sitting at the place across the street looking out the window and we see this gigantic bus pull up in front of it and inside the bus is like all these disco lights and like green neon lights going on and we look carefully in the bus there's a stripper pole inside the bus that's awesome and I'm like
3801329	3802551	What in the hell is that?
3802691	3807177	And my friend speaks up, I don't remember if it was Alan or my friend, says, oh, it's one of those stripper buses.
3807338	3809280	I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3810322	3811283	They have that now?
3811343	3815266	They have traveling... Put on your seatbelt!
3815646	3817468	Or just strap yourself to the pole.
3817548	3818669	How does that work?
3818709	3820130	Rob, it's not a stripper bus.
3820250	3821050	It's a limo bus.
3821291	3824073	This is funny.
3824473	3828636	Last week, we did our Game Summit thing.
3828656	3834401	One of the days we went out, they took us to a few wineries and they did wine tasting.
3834921	3837124	Well, they had two different limo buses.
3837164	3839326	They had a shorter one, and then they had a larger one.
3839447	3841669	Well, the larger one had a stripper pole in the back.
3842150	3844032	So it's just a bus.
3844553	3846895	But, I mean... Hold on, hold on.
3846975	3849779	If we're going to talk about party bus, we need party bus music.
3850520	3852021	Brilliant, I approve.
3854013	3861962	So yeah, so they do have a stripper pool in the back, and I suppose if you were to rent it, say for a bachelor party or something, you could have strippers performing.
3862643	3868009	Now granted, it might not be the safest thing for them to be doing, but sure, why not?
3868846	3884231	So, finally the lights go on in this bus and there's like, I shit you not, like 50 drunk chicks all piled in this bus and it's like the lights went on at the club at 2am and they all just start pouring out the front of the bus and go on in the little gay club.
3884591	3885131	Okay.
3887232	3897135	And that's why I stopped going to that club also, Rob, because every Friday and Saturday night it's like, let's let all the straights in and there was like two gay people there and I was like, what is going on?
3897195	3897415	Like...
3906107	3910389	I haven't been there in like six years now.
3910429	3912590	I'm sorry, but I was just fascinated.
3912630	3919114	Like what if that bus, I mean that bus was a big bus and it was taking up an entire lane and surely it doesn't turn well.
3919494	3922196	And I'm just thinking like what if that bus gets in an accident?
3922476	3926038	You're going to have just drunk chicks pouring out the windshield.
3926338	3926898	Possibly.
3926918	3928539	You know what?
3928699	3931461	They won't know because they're drunk so it doesn't matter.
3932641	3937545	That is a terrible thing, having a bunch of drunk chicks inside of a bus with a stripper pole.
3937846	3939267	Jeez, that would suck.
3939887	3943551	Well, and then all the skanky, slutty twink boys that you were nice enough to call the stripper boys.
3943871	3947934	All the skanky, slutty, snotty twink boys that are faces won't even know because they'll just be like, whatever.
3948495	3954260	I like how I went out of my way to not give the clubs names and then you're just like... Oh, this is interesting.
3954340	3957342	Okay, Tiger Call linked us a picture here in chat of a stripper bus.
3958423	3959964	This must be in Nevada.
3960104	3962845	That's an advertisement, yeah.
3963505	3964926	It was close to that, though.
3965626	3966447	It was close to that.
3967087	3969648	But it looked a little bit more like a regular stripper bus.
3969688	3970649	That looks like a billboard.
3970829	3972289	A regular stripper bus.
3973050	3977032	Rob's making distinctions between types of buses.
3977872	3978132	Anyhow.
3978272	3978872	Interesting.
3979713	3980013	Okay.
3980673	3982454	We should go to Japanese release dates, shouldn't we?
3982474	4006546	That's not a stripper pole, that's just a pole so that you don't fall over Yeah, you hold on to it, you know In lieu of a seatbelt, you know Alright, let's go to the Japanese release dates We're gonna make them a little more interesting tonight God's gonna read them in Korean Beep beep, here come your Japanese release dates

4087308	4089249	I don't know, but I'm going to go jack-a-jack all night long.
4089269	4090750	I'm trying to look at the music.
4091090	4093652	It looks like it's just showing you chords.
4095553	4097314	This looks really boring, actually.
4097394	4099175	I think I'd fall asleep playing jack-a-jack music.
4099215	4101597	False advertising, man.
4101657	4102317	Oh, I get it.
4102818	4105639	If you jack-a-jack-a before bed, you'll fall asleep easier.
4105659	4109021	That's true.
4110802	4112303	You're a pervert, Rob.
4113084	4114805	And then on the Sony PSP this week...
4123482	4126787	I shit you not, that's the name of the game.
4127468	4128829	Three-way standoff.
4129130	4130331	Whoa, three-way, eh?

4151868	4154250	There's other PSP games coming out, but I'm done.
4154270	4154670	They're not.
4154810	4155771	Do-ra-ra-ra.
4155831	4156271	No, no, no.
4156291	4158433	You're not done until we... No, I closed it.

4163176	4164977	Death Spank Thongs of Virtue.
4164997	4166858	That looks like an awesome game.

4206472	4206833	All right.
4207153	4208614	Are we ready to get back into some gaming news?
4208874	4209334	Why not?
4209634	4216978	Well, first I'm going to derail the show again because Alan said I have to play this link on air because it has to do with the stripper bus.
4218019	4220140	So this is a video from TheOnion.com.
4221581	4222222	Oh, God.
4222262	4223442	I only know where this is going to go.
4223882	4225263	Again, this is coming from TheOnion.com.
4227064	4231687	Let me stop you real quick, because you did miss one since you didn't want to talk about it.
4231787	4232688	What did I miss?
4233468	4239732	There's Ryuga Gotoku Shinshou.
4240692	4244555	It's the... Oh, great, and now I can't remember the damn title.
4245855	4249577	The Yakuza on the PSP came out this week as well.
4249658	4252019	That's a little bit of a big title for Japan.
4253680	4255021	Can I talk about the stripper bus again?
4255061	4256782	Yeah, talk about the stripper bus.
4259964	4262205	If you're just joining us, we are covering a developing story.
4262245	4271451	We go back now to Southern California where a VH1 bus crashed just a short while ago, spilling more than 2,000 pounds of slut onto interstate five-year Palmdale.
4271771	4280636	The bus was transporting contestants for the new VH1 reality series, The Road to Knoxville, in which 18 scantily clad young women vie for the heart of divorced stuntman Johnny Knoxville.
4280976	4288921	Officials there are struggling to control the spread of slut, which has already polluted the roadway and is spreading now down a hillside into residential areas.
4289241	4292783	Let's go live to Onion News Network's Brian Scott, who's live on the scene.
4292803	4294644	Brian, what's exactly going on out there?
4294684	4296125	Well, it's just horrible, Anna.
4296165	4301709	The highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of this orange-skinned slut.
4301769	4302789	I've only been here an hour.
4303009	4307112	I've already seen four three-way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings.
4307532	4312154	and Downwind, the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.
4312375	4313335	Sounds like quite a scene.
4313475	4318338	Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington Beach early this morning, is that right?
4318378	4319498	That's where it began, yes.
4319538	4326862	The sluts were being transported from a negligee-wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl-on-girl paintball match when the crash occurred.
4327242	4334308	In speculation, in fact, the accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on the vehicle and getting on the driver.
4334348	4338411	Now, the local fire department is just not equipped to handle something this toxic.
4338671	4346898	The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel River and officials are concerned that the sluts might go skinny dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in it.
4346918	4349500	But we should say, too, that the crews, they're doing their best.
4349580	4355745	They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip-offs and shooter contests in the ditch behind me.
4355845	4358286	Now, we've just gotten word that VH1 has issued a statement.
4358306	4359086	It's on their website.
4359386	4362108	It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts.
4362208	4368790	Yes, but the EPA has urged VH1 to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly concentrated slut they use now.
4368910	4372032	Yeah, sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1's going to ever go for that.
4372292	4374573	Ryan, stay safe out there, and don't fuck any of those sluts.
4374653	4375433	All right, thanks, Iowa.
4375473	4379575	Moving on, a new Apple laptop has become preloaded with a half-written coming-of-age novel.
4381095	4382396	I fucking love The Onion.
4384376	4389218	Did you see the one they did about... You have to understand, that was what we saw last night.
4389538	4392239	Right here in Sacramento.
4392279	4393059	Okay, Rob, we get it.
4393540	4393940	Just saying.
4394780	4395660	I love The Onion, too.
4396060	4396361	Me, too.
4396381	4401742	Did you see the one about the impending flood from Folsom Dam and then creating the memorial for it?
4402043	4402283	No.
4403583	4406224	and talking to the first person who dies in the flood.
4407685	4408626	Actually, you know what's funny?
4408706	4412708	Matt and I, the old apartment we lived at, I mean, we can say this now because we don't live there anymore.
4413068	4415149	We used to live in an apartment, the old studio.
4415189	4418750	This was the studio from about episodes, what, about 50 to probably like 150?
4419751	4423753	We're taped at the apartment where Loki and I used to live together, which was right next to Folsom Dam.
4424133	4425153	We lived in this little apartment complex.
4425173	4426534	It was literally right next to it.
4427094	4432277	And, you know, if that dam ever broke, we'd be looking down on all the people getting flooded out because we were on top of the hill.
4432657	4434138	Aw, poor people.
4434218	4436160	Good one, Rob.
4436320	4438361	Rob, you have so much concern for other people.
4439622	4440743	Hey, video games!
4440863	4441264	News!
4441324	4441984	What?
4442004	4442965	What are those?
4443045	4443746	Video games.
4444686	4445067	Loki?
4445167	4445407	Yes.
4446107	4447268	Let's talk about games.
4448529	4455655	Nielsen, the wonderful agency that talks about different ads and entertainment trends...
4456535	4467663	They did a study of the six EA Sports titles, including NHL 10, NBA Live 09, that had in-game advertisements in them.
4468003	4475608	And I guess, apparently, they increased household dollars spent on different things by 24%.
4477109	4480651	One of them that they looked at was Gatorade, and that was, I guess, the case there.
4481872	4482653	It's interesting.
4482813	4483033	I don't...
4485255	4485615	I don't know.
4485635	4492580	I don't buy that people, you know, if they see Gatorade on a billboard in the background, that they're going to really go and buy Gatorade.
4492600	4505271	I think a lot of players that play sports games for a long period of time, maybe perhaps like drinking, you know, Gatorade or soda or whatever, and it's just a coincidence, if you ask me.
4506331	4511996	But apparently they have a press release out and summarizing the different things, but...
4513862	4517787	I don't know, like, if they cover Axe Body Spray or something like that.
4518087	4518868	That'd be interesting.
4519168	4528919	Actually, Nielsen's been running studies on our show here at Orange Lounge Radio, and it's showing that after tonight's episode, it looks like we had an increase.
4529219	4532242	33% of our listeners decided to go to Six Flags after tonight's show.
4532323	4533444	It's something else.
4533464	4534165	It's something else.
4538267	4539708	Alright, I'll stop.
4541409	4549173	But yeah, they said out of, I guess, the panel of 100,000 households representing the U.S.
4549253	4553295	population according to their home scan panel or whatever,
4553775	4557497	It says scanned video game UPC barcodes.
4557657	4561780	The scanned barcodes were then matched to a reference library of more than 14,000 video games.
4562260	4577669	Nielsen compared the households that purchased the least of one of the studied games before and after the Gatorade branding was integrated into the games, the test group, with the households that didn't purchase one of the games, the control group.
4577709	4580311	It says the test and control groups are projected out abroad
4580891	4606549	Blah blah, see here it says, well overall they noticed that there was a 24% increase in sales after that So, you know what you just did, you just opened the floodgates for them to like, you know, put in all sorts of ridiculous stuff Way to go Nielsen And trust me, it's gonna get ridiculous as we will get to in part B Oh goody Ridiculously cool though I have to say, so uh
4607009	4607350	All right.
4608411	4614859	And honestly, I think when we do talk about this, this is how you do the advertisement because it's fucking awesome.
4616281	4617482	Now you got me all curious.
4618043	4618383	All right.
4619305	4620806	We're going to be talking about Sega game.
4621347	4621808	Ooh, goody.
4622298	4623099	KONAMI & HARMONIX
4641519	4643440	It was a lawsuit launched by Konami.
4644180	4650342	There was a filing in a federal court in Texas this week, and the two parties agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims.
4650822	4660766	It was a suit over Harmonix's Rock Band infringing on patents that were owned by Konami because, of course, Konami had Guitar Freaks many years ago, etc., etc.
4660906	4663486	Rock Band supposedly had copies of that.
4663606	4667848	Remember they said Rock Revolution failed because of the Rock Band 2 stuff?
4667908	4669829	Well, among other things.
4669869	4670809	That was maybe like...
4672307	4672767	Was there tongue?
4694296	4696617	We will not know because it's sealed, okay?
4720163	4721464	You should be playing this game.
4722125	4724826	When I was your age, I was playing this.
4726588	4728869	It's the classic video game of the week, DarkSakura, what should they be playing?
4729429	4733052	It's Super Mario Bros.
4733072	4733052	2.
4733672	4733933	Sweet.
4734673	4742258	Which, I actually have to thank Tiara for suggesting Super Mario Bros., but I wanted to do Super Mario Bros.
4742278	4742258	2.
4742378	4745561	I was actually surprised you have never picked this before, but you haven't.
4745821	4747022	You've done three, but never two.
4748002	4748663	Super Mario Bros.
4748883	4750385	2 wasn't actually a Super Mario Bros.
4750405	4751025	game originally.
4751726	4759053	It was called You May Call Joe Doki Doki Panic, which was also on the Famicom Disk System and had an intro and an ending.
4759654	4761335	But the intro music sounds very familiar.
4761355	4762316	Yeah.
4764302	4766425	It's so cute.
4767406	4768968	Oh no, the kids get sucked into a book.
4769929	4771230	Little monkey boy is running away.
4772151	4773373	Yeah, I don't know what the little monkey is about.
4773413	4774053	He just is there.
4774494	4777537	Oh no, we four people are randomly showing up in these children's bedroom.
4778178	4779480	Let's jump into the book.
4779960	4781102	Not creepy at all.
4781122	4781162	No.
4782703	4784005	Now let's flip the disc over.
4784946	4786767	Because, like I said, Famicom disc.
4787448	4788950	So anyway, um... What do you want to hear?
4788990	4790011	Doki Doki Panic music?
4790311	4791292	It's the same thing.
4791332	4791812	Yeah, pretty much.
4791872	4801522	Although, it's funny, some of the sound effects are different, and they did other sprite swaps, like these weird-looking head things were there, but they turned them into mushrooms.
4802964	4810254	and, yeah, this one, um... So you pulled heads out of the grounds instead of, like, you know... No.
4810294	4811957	Because that'd be really cool.
4812017	4812698	You pulled the vegetables out.
4812718	4814681	You pulled severed heads out of the ground instead of vegetables.
4814701	4818767	It's like these masks are sitting there instead of the mushroom blocks.
4820490	4825536	At any rate, the whole thought that Nintendo had was that the original Super Mario Bros.
4825556	4829241	2 that came out in 1986 was too hard.
4829761	4831243	Oh no, American players!
4831884	4835608	Which is stupid because Japanese RPGs are ridiculously easy to start off.
4836550	4838292	Did you ever play Final Fantasy 7 in Japanese?
4839393	4840054	Freaking easy!
4841075	4842797	It's like, hit dead, hit dead.
4843578	4846963	But it is very, very hard, the original Super Mario game.
4847023	4853491	The Mario, when it came out as lost levels here on the Super Nintendo cartridge, the All-Stars or whatever, it was really hard.
4854232	4856495	Beat it eventually, but it was a hard game.
4857757	4869308	Well, um, so what they did is, um, they took, uh, Doki Doki Panic and they, uh, I guess re-sprited it with the main characters and changed a few things.
4869348	4877536	Like, they, because I guess there was more capacity to do stuff on the cartridge, they, um, they actually just, uh,
4878743	4880163	Could put in some more graphical elements.
4880283	4888686	Of course, one thing that you'll notice listening to the two different tracks is because the sound processor is just a little bit different for the games on disc versus the games.
4889026	4893387	Like, if you ever listen to Legend of Zelda on disc from the disc system, the music sounds different.
4894367	4897788	I mean, it's the same music, but it uses different instrumentation.
4897808	4898168	But anyway.
4898668	4899769	And different sound effects.
4901529	4905070	Like the bird thing squawks differently.
4905130	4906511	And it doesn't have the bonus game.
4906531	4907851	That has a different looking bonus game.
4908651	4918882	Anyway, so they did this because they thought it would be more popular and that it would be fun and easy.
4919322	4928071	And since then, it actually came out in Japan in 1992 as Super Mario USA, which came out with Super Mario All-Stars.
4928332	4929833	So we each got something fun.
4930994	4939700	Um, but so yeah, you walk around and you throw potions down, which in the original, in the Doki Doki Panic, it's magic lamps.
4940160	4945083	Because it has sort of this, I guess, Arabian Nights kind of theme in all these other levels.
4946104	4952008	But you get your power-ups by going into these little reverse universe things and...
4952808	4969294	In Super Mario 2, of course our US one, you can play as Mario, who is the all-around average dude, or Luigi, who is... I always called him Crazy Legs Dude, because his legs spin, but he jumps higher than anybody else.
4969995	4972195	And you can play Toad, who, by the way, is not useless.
4972215	4976537	You play Toad when you need to dig a lot, because he digs faster.
4977397	4979058	Or when you're trying to get those extra power-ups.
4979434	4981254	Who was a chick in Doki Doki Panic, right?
4981274	4981315	No.
4982115	4985416	The blue character was a girl, wasn't it?
4985436	4986136	But that wasn't Toad.
4986516	4987056	That was Mario.
4987436	4988396	Oh, my bad.
4988796	4989637	Yeah.
4989677	4994778	And then you've got Princess, who is the pink chick with the hair and pants in the Doki Doki Panic.
4995538	4996679	But she can float, though.
4996979	4998019	Yes, she can float.
4999779	5000860	But Toad can't jump for shit.
5001100	5005461	Anyway, you get POW blocks, which blow up things, and they're really fun.
5006441	5026606	and it had a life meter which was unique for Mario game you know instead of your different sizes but it was really stupid because like if you lose one of your your little segments there then you have to kill like a certain number of enemies so that you can get a heart to come up and then you you know whatever
5027966	5028747	You will refill it.
5029587	5030888	Also, to get your star.
5031468	5036471	And I have to thank the irate gamer for this analogy because it was spot on.
5038112	5042235	You have to get like five cherries and then your star will show up for your invincibility.
5042655	5046257	Except it takes forever to get to where you are unless you're at the very bottom of the screen.
5046938	5051440	And the way he described it, you have time to take a shit before the star arrives, which he proceeded to do.
5051820	5053581	I have to thank him for demonstrating that.
5054902	5055302	Wow.
5055843	5056023	Yes.
5058335	5069546	Anyway, if you pull up the little plants in the little reversed universe, then you get coins, which you can use for a bonus game, which is basically like slots.
5070527	5075252	And there's a pattern to it, and I used to always be able to get the pattern where you'd always get them to match.
5076293	5080377	It seemed like if you hit the button really fast, you could usually win it.
5081038	5082039	It was like...
5084577	5088119	For me, it was like you hit one and then you hit the next two twice as fast.
5089460	5092862	It was like a da-da-da was my rhythm.
5093542	5095783	And I always got it.
5096504	5099225	So, I guess it depends.
5100186	5104749	Of course, if you also hit the button really right away, like after you've gotten a cherry, then you'll always get a cherry on the next one.
5107153	5109614	So I would have like 50 million lives by the time I was done.
5110875	5117218	You've also got little warp zones where if you throw your little jar at the right spot, it goes down.
5118159	5119639	Ooh, you got audio issues going on.
5120880	5122121	Were the warp zones in Doki Doki Panic?
5123101	5123821	Yes, they were.
5124041	5124341	Interesting.
5125422	5129543	In fact, if you watch the playthrough, because I linked a playthrough for Doki Doki Panic.
5129563	5131404	Which is all you need to see of Doki Doki Panic, really.
5131444	5132664	It really wasn't the better game.
5132764	5138666	Like, a lot of people are like, oh, you know, it was the original, but they made improvements when they brought it over here.
5138866	5142667	Yeah, well, keep in mind, they had more, if I'm right, they had more storage capacity.
5142987	5152409	The only thing that we're missing is the dinky little intro, which you had to flip the disc anyway to start off with, and then flip to play the game, and then flip to go back, and flip and flip and flip, and whatever.
5152429	5153269	I got tired of flipping off.
5153910	5156970	So, but yeah, all the warps and everything were there.
5156990	5160871	You just throw them where there's a particular jar, you go down the jar, boom, you're somewhere else.
5161471	5163332	And I loved this little trick for, was it 6-1?
5163352	5163372	6-1.
5164651	5165111	Um, so yeah, uh,
5194514	5201444	It was... They actually were planning on releasing Doki Doki Panic in the U.S.
5201484	5204148	at some point, but they actually just didn't.
5205870	5207553	And so they, you know...
5209714	5218559	One thing about this though is that the reason why it does kind of fit in musically and with sound effects is because the soundtrack was composed by Koji Kondo.
5219340	5220160	Oh, okay.
5221141	5228265	It's very interesting to me like how much this ended up kind of just becoming a part of the Mario mythos, if you will.
5228305	5236230	Like, you know, later Mario games had some of these characters that first appeared in really Doki Doki Panic kind of crossed over into the Mario universe, especially like some of the
5236650	5237271	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5252788	5266822	as much as you might want to think Nintendo was kind of rude for dumbing it down it really worked for them it did on multiple levels in this case it was interesting to me though just real quick sorry I know you have more you want to say but it was really interesting to me how this game really fit into the
5267422	5272466	Very odd 8-bit sequels that were nothing like the originals in many ways.
5272766	5276909	You had this, you had Castlevania II Simon's Quest, which was a huge departure from the original.
5277270	5279471	Zelda II was a huge departure from the original.
5279491	5284075	It was very interesting how a lot of games were so different back then.
5284535	5286157	What's this ostrich thing spitting eggs at me?
5286177	5286757	And then I liked it.
5315812	5321899	Um, so at any rate, um, we, uh, later on there were the re-releases.
5321919	5324703	There was Super Mario All-Stars, which was really sweet.
5325544	5330329	And then, um, there was, uh, you remember the Satellaview?
5330750	5335255	There was a Gaiden version that was, um, Super Mario All-Stars on Satellaview.
5337049	5345081	and it was called BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge and so it ran in weekly volumes like all the other Satellaview games.
5346103	5349708	Then we got Super Mario Advance which was...
5352099	5353541	The Super Mario Bros.
5353761	5361188	2, which actually was a lot harder, but it had some innovations that kept the game fresh, I think, for a lot of people.
5361509	5362229	I really liked it.
5363230	5374162	And so it's Super Mario 2, or as the original was, because I think I'd have to lump the games together, is that it was...
5376058	5377618	and Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.
5377898	5386940	And actually, since I'm talking about that too, they did a Mario-style poster based off of the original cover for Doki Doki Panic.
5389181	5396523	And the characters that were in there was... I just want to point out, in the time you've been talking, someone beat Mario 2 here on YouTube.
5396803	5397563	That's pretty amazing.
5397763	5398483	And by the way, I was...
5400342	5401383	You cut out again.
5401403	5403464	That mic is getting dated.
5404265	5405266	No, the mic is new.
5405326	5406207	I need a new cord.
5407107	5412271	At any rate, Imogene was one of the little toad-looking characters.
5412912	5416094	And then there was Mama, who was the one in the blue.
5416394	5417075	That was Luigi.
5418116	5422899	And then there was Lena, who was the pink princess harem girl.
5424040	5427363	And Papa, who became Toad.
5430074	5436839	And he actually, um... I think became a... No, I'm wrong.
5437159	5437839	Forget I said anything.
5437979	5438180	Anyway.
5439140	5439480	Okay.
5440521	5442182	Oh, now here's the differences.
5442222	5443163	Different title screen.
5443984	5447966	And then the story takes place in a storybook instead of in the dream world.
5449127	5453810	And you have a save feature because it was on the disk system.
5455251	5457093	You cannot run with the B button.
5458533	5466578	There are, like I said, different music changes, different graphical changes, and you need fewer hits to hit wart in Doki Doki Panic than in Super Mario 2.
5467178	5478105	The waterfall is faster than in Super Mario 2, and of course different sound effects because of the number of pins between the Famicom disc and the full-size NES cartridges.
5479265	5479906	And there you go.
5481046	5482207	So it's sort of a split one.
5482247	5486750	We have Yumi Kojo, Doki Doki Panic, and Super Mario Bros. 2.
5488442	5488942	All right.
5489523	5494986	There it is, your classic game of the week, Mario 2, here in the U.S.
5495046	5496347	or Doki Doki Panic overseas.
5496948	5497368	Good pick.
5498088	5499409	One that I'm sure a lot of people remember.
5500130	5500370	All right.
5500730	5503452	We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5503472	5504312	We're going to be right back.
5504332	5506374	There's plenty more to come tonight in Part B of our show.
5506394	5509035	We're actually going to get into some more of the news that's coming out of Tokyo Game Show.
5509055	5510336	We didn't do a lot this segment.
5510636	5511517	We've got plenty more to come.
5511557	5512578	Of course, your calls.
5513158	5516262	and tweets and emails of which I'm sure there's plenty.
5516482	5519185	We're going to get to all those and more Rice Princess and the Doctor.
5519766	5520126	Yay.
5520206	5520627	Maybe.
5520987	5522329	If I don't kick them off the show.
5522349	5522950	Yes, it's going to happen.
5523030	5526053	All right, now they'll be here to tell more poop jokes when we return.
5527034	5529037	With more of Orange Lodge Radio right after this.
5535123	5562092	And welcome back everybody to the second half of Orange Lounge Radio Live here at All Games Radio www.allgames.com where we do tape live every Sunday night 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show Going back over to DarkSakura for a minute here because she was talking about something during break that I thought was fascinating You mentioned you were telling Rice Princess about some documentary you've been watching lately It's not a documentary I'm watching a Japanese drama from 2006 called Gal Circle Uh-huh
5562632	5568837	That's about these girls that are homeless and live in Shinjuku.
5568877	5570959	They quit school to go be Parapara dancers.
5571819	5575882	And they hang out in this warehouse and leech free food wherever they can find it.
5577504	5579945	It's a cute show, but one of the characters is...
5582182	5582783	What the hell?
5582823	5589410	I know, I'm listening to something coming from the living room that's like... Dan's watching the Angry Nintendo Nerd.
5589750	5590190	Oh, God.
5590931	5595856	Anyway, so... But, like, the whole thing starts off with these U.S.
5595936	5598779	troops dropping somebody on Shinjuku.
5599180	5602283	And it's this guy dressed up as a cowboy named Shinosuke.
5603086	5603306	Outro Music
5617694	5618054	The part.
5618134	5619055	Sounds amazingly racist.
5619115	5619675	I love it.
5619695	5620876	And this little girl named Momo.
5623097	5624638	They're all like speaking random English.
5624698	5625338	It's hilarious.
5625398	5627059	So it's not a documentary.
5627200	5628740	It's just a drama-dy?
5629721	5631442	It's a dorama.
5632122	5632683	Oh, okay.
5633956	5640538	But it's like this guy completely knows nothing of Japanese life and he's teaching the girls these lessons through his innocence.
5640698	5642859	And they teach him the magic of dance.
5645180	5649601	I'm on the fourth episode now out of 11 and it's pretty funny.
5650241	5651662	I don't know how I missed this.
5652482	5653662	Yeah, I think I'll watch more Hoarders.
5654103	5654383	All right.
5655943	5658104	Rob, teach me the magic of dance.
5658244	5658844	Excuse me.
5658924	5660184	Sorry, not time for Twitter topics yet.
5660244	5660605	Be quiet.
5660805	5661065	All right.
5661585	5661845	Hey.
5663895	5674543	I was at the club the other night and I actually heard a song and the lyrics were and the song is called Commander and the lyrics were tonight I'll be your commander and I command you to dance
5677217	5678417	That's where that came from.
5678477	5679998	Yeah, that was my Facebook update the other night.
5680018	5681438	Just a little bit homosexual.
5681478	5682519	Just a little.
5682639	5685240	Was it Commander or Commander?
5685260	5685720	No, Commander.
5685740	5687080	Like a Commodore 64.
5687680	5689301	I like it Commander better.
5689741	5694422	No, when I tell you who it was singing it, that's how you'll know how homosexual it was.
5694962	5695323	You ready?
5695663	5695983	Yes.
5696103	5696683	Kelly Rowland.
5697691	5698292	Wow.
5698672	5700253	Like the not Beyonce.
5700774	5701374	But yeah.
5701835	5702155	Beyonce.
5702195	5703616	The other chick from Destiny's Child.
5703757	5703997	Yes.
5704277	5704617	Exactly.
5704777	5706079	I can't believe it's not Beyonce.
5706139	5707160	Hey, video game news.
5707220	5707720	Oh my God.
5707760	5708941	Who knew we did that on this show?
5709582	5711644	A lot of quick video game news tonight.
5711684	5712244	Holy hell.
5712264	5713525	There's a lot of quick news tonight.
5714006	5718390	And I believe Loki has a story starting off about Phantasy Star.
5718630	5723614	But I want to say this first because this somehow did not even make our show roll, which is a travesty.
5724355	5728658	Phantasy Star Online 2 teased in a trailer this week at Tokyo Game Show.
5729098	5730038	What in the world?
5730178	5730739	I know, right?
5731619	5738243	Because it's the 10th anniversary of Phantasy Star Online and they have announced that next year they're going to put out Phantasy Star Online 2 for PC.
5739024	5739584	I'll play it.
5740024	5741105	But it's not on console.
5741125	5742946	That's weird to me that it's not on console.
5742986	5744046	I wonder what they're going to do with it.
5744066	5746488	They're still getting to MMOs on consoles.
5746528	5753352	I mean, at least like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 because so far this generation there's been Final Fantasy XI.
5754896	5755557	Wasn't there another one on 360?
5755597	5757778	Oh, Fancy Star Universe.
5759879	5762661	But that had more of a single-player component to it, though.
5763241	5764262	It wasn't just an MMO.
5764362	5768304	If those servers shut down, the game would still be playable.
5768605	5770005	It's like a really bad anime.
5770566	5773007	Sorry, I didn't mean to derail your story, Loki, but I had to throw that out there.
5773267	5778811	Before the break, we were talking about advertisement in games and how it's kind of terrible sometimes.
5779171	5780732	Well, this is how you do it, dammit.
5780872	5781573	Because, uh...
5782693	5788375	I couldn't think of a better way to possibly advertise in a game than how it's done in Phantasy Star Portable 2.
5789235	5793917	What, may you ask, is actually the case with this?
5794717	5798038	You can play Colonel Sanders in Phantasy Star Portable 2.
5799519	5800299	That is awesome.
5800379	5801059	Wait, wait, wait.
5801219	5802580	Like a playable character?
5802600	5803840	Like a playable character.
5804220	5806441	Like the Colonel is there to kick ass.
5807681	5828361	Back from the dead, with his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices I read some story that like, most kids under 18 don't even know who Colonel Sanders is Oh, but he's gonna come and bitch slap him in the face now Now you'll remember me forever
5829304	5837629	No, but seriously, they put them in the game, and this isn't a big surprise because actually, I believe it's in the upgraded version of Phantasy Star Portable 2.
5837849	5839049	It's Infinity, I guess.
5839670	5846513	And the original Phantasy Star Portable 2 actually had Pizza Hut stuff in there with like a Pizza Hut box shield.
5846794	5848254	Oh, hell, you know what that means?
5848415	5851056	Coming in the next Phantasy Star game is Taco Bell.
5853057	5853297	Wow.
5853317	5854398	Make or run for the PSP.
5855248	5857248	or the Noid comes back as a playable character.
5857268	5858949	Dude, the Noid would be awesome.
5858969	5863170	I'm sorry, but if anyone's seen the anime Project Echo, you don't mess with the Colonel.
5864230	5865850	It's the Colonel.
5868211	5869311	Oh, that's so ridiculous.
5870511	5871152	Lee Awesome.
5872652	5873232	It is awesome.
5873292	5881554	So instead of casting the typical ice firebolt spells, you'll be casting mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.
5882298	5888780	Heart Attack, Grease Fire, KFC Bowl, Double Down, the bowl that looks like poop.
5891501	5891701	Ew.
5892601	5893681	Wait, wait, wait.
5893721	5895302	That's nasty and appropriate.
5895342	5896582	And now it can't be unseen.
5896622	5899843	No, they have pictures of him attacking stuff, so I'm trying to see what he...
5900743	5907088	It almost looks like, and I kid you not, and I don't understand this, but it almost looks like he has a magic wand.
5907128	5911410	Like he's fucking Harry Potter of the, you know, fast food world or something.
5911430	5914913	Yeah, he's like hitting something.
5914953	5917354	Yeah, seriously looking like he's bitch slapping someone right there.
5918155	5919476	This is all on Famitsu, of course.
5919836	5923458	I got one more here because it looks like he's throwing a fireball or something.
5924439	5925640	God, I love the Japanese.
5925920	5928501	Yeah, he's got like, seriously, he's got like a magical wand.
5928942	5929242	I mean...
5930526	5938772	Colonel Sanders, did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
5941535	5950261	SSJ100Matt says, gravy heel, please VidPower says, when are they going to make a fighter featuring the Arby's oven mitt?
5951182	5954645	DDRDollarBill says, your wand, Sanders, is it made from chicken feather?
5957012	5983711	I seriously think you know how Burger King does their stupid Burger King games Sneak King was fucking rad which by the way when they do release their Kinect games I'm buying all of them I don't care how terrible they are because they're awesome seriously KFC needs to come up with an original game where it's like oh kids don't know who Colonel Sanders is he's back to kick some fucking ass with his magical wand he's a fucking ninja that's what he is
5984091	5985712	Ooh, I'm back from the dead!
5985852	5986172	Ooh!
5986332	5988353	He's gonna battle Voldemort as well.
5988633	5990755	Is it bad that your little thing is blinking red?
5991095	5992295	Does that mean it's gonna explode?
5992355	5993876	Nah, it just means the battery's low.
5993936	5994417	Okay.
5995117	5996778	This means I won't have internet after a while.
5996798	5997418	I'm just a little worried.
5997438	5998459	Alright.
5998519	5999899	It means the time bomb's going off.
5999919	6001720	Oh no.
6001940	6003982	This show will self-destruct in 30 seconds.
6004062	6005342	You brought Burger King into my house.
6008223	6008703	Yeah, it's alright.
6008743	6012045	Anyways, I should finish my downloads when I get home because this is so slow.
6012185	6013006	What are you downloading?
6013426	6013686	Apps.
6014306	6016007	I'm downloading the two Monkey Island apps.
6017108	6017368	Sweet.
6018189	6020390	But I thought that's not like a 4G router?
6021330	6021771	No, it's just 3G.
6024452	6026314	Oh, I don't know anything about it.
6026334	6026994	Next story!
6027995	6031298	But yeah, I'm sorry, it's just so awesome that we have to keep talking about the girl.
6032659	6038784	So, Halo Reach, of course, you know, one of the big things with Halo, and it's kind of become infamous because of it.
6039565	6047271	The horrible people on Xbox Live, and it's a lot of little kids that really shouldn't be playing... I love when you start off, the horrible people on Xbox Live.
6048932	6049393	It really...
6050816	6054457	There's just a bunch of little kids that should have no business playing this game.
6054937	6056398	They're on there playing this game.
6057058	6068862	So if you run across some douchebags that are playing the game and being jerks online and you mute them, if enough people mute them, they will just be auto-muted by everybody.
6069322	6073503	So you won't have to listen to them over a period of time.
6074103	6076904	But they just like to call people fun, amazing guys.
6078525	6078725	Yep.
6082791	6083291	Wow.
6083872	6085853	I praise your heterosexuality.
6086954	6087755	We are friends.
6090757	6092658	So that's available, of course, now.
6093859	6098943	And then, apparently, who would have thought, the PSP 2 is in the works.
6099643	6105568	And, in fact, the Mortal Kombat developers have a development unit of it right now.
6105928	6111912	They say it's a pretty powerful machine and that they will be working on games for it.
6112012	6117616	They don't even have a 3DS yet, but apparently they have a PSP2.
6117756	6121859	Perhaps the PSP2 will be launching next year soon?
6122459	6122719	Maybe?
6123960	6128203	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what they do to enhance stuff on that.
6128363	6130664	Wow, newsflash of PSP2s in development.
6130705	6131285	Shocking, huh?
6133150	6149085	File that next to duh and of course But the news is that they have a unit and that it would probably be close to be releasing Next year's E3 I'm sure it will be next holiday Alongside Shattered Memories 2 The next winner of the E3 game
6150006	6153249	Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio, three games analysts.
6154130	6154610	Ah, yes.
6154810	6155931	Analysts, sorry, analysts.
6156051	6165880	And Red Faction Armageddon is coming May 2011 next year, and of course that'll be the next big game from the Saints Row developers.
6166700	6171404	And speaking of Saints Row, they will be putting out a new Saints Row game next fall.
6172685	6174527	So sad, it's so far away.
6175967	6176667	I love that game.
6177348	6177728	I know you do.
6178269	6180170	It's so terribly awesome.
6180570	6181191	It really is.
6181351	6188956	Well, something maybe you could play in the meantime would be PopCap World because PopCap and NCSoft have teamed up to bring you PopCap World.
6189456	6203706	Oh boy, because you have NCSoft who makes those highly addictive Korean MMOs and then some of the ones over here too such as ION and Guild Wars and then PopCap, makers of virtual crack like Peggle, Plants and Zombies and Bejeweled.
6204406	6208210	PopCap and NCSoft have come together to bring PopCap World.
6208350	6210211	This platform will be launching later this year.
6210251	6211833	It's going to be operated by NCSoft.
6211873	6214375	It's going to feature 13 PopCap titles at launch.
6214735	6218819	It's going to be free with optional premium paid elements to be added later.
6219220	6224564	It's going to have Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies and an all-new multiplayer game called Super Zuma.
6225345	6227205	But here's the other thing you should know about this.
6227746	6228846	It's only for Korea.
6229946	6231166	So it's not coming out here.
6231586	6233547	Why the fuck did you tell us, Rob?
6233587	6235687	Because I just want you to know what you're missing out on.
6235987	6240108	Super Zuma, by the way, was, quote, built exclusively for Korean players.
6240588	6244729	So Super Zuma apparently uses StarCraft characters.
6246049	6248130	And the screen is very narrow for their eyes.
6248470	6249050	Stop it.
6249790	6250590	Hey, I can say it.
6250670	6251331	I'm Asian.
6252111	6252711	You can say it.
6252891	6253572	Yes, I can.
6253652	6254012	Alright.
6254832	6257153	So, yeah, that's going to be interesting.
6257874	6262356	I'm surprised they won't release that here, but maybe Facebook games are doing well enough for them here.
6262416	6264237	Did they ever release the Zuma game on Facebook?
6265237	6265558	I don't know.
6265578	6267019	I think they did Zoom on Facebook.
6267199	6268060	I think they were going to.
6268360	6271304	They were going to do Zoom on Facebook and then of course there's Bejeweled.
6271884	6274247	And now it's all about just cross-promoting their iPhone apps.
6274267	6275108	That's how they're making money.
6275268	6277810	Loki, do you have Plants vs. Zombies on your new iPod Touch?
6277971	6278311	Yes, I do.
6278431	6278932	It's very fun.
6279112	6279572	Awesome!
6280593	6283356	Oh yeah, I played a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies this week for the first time.
6283436	6286660	Can you believe I've never played that game before and I finally played it this week on Xbox Live?
6287020	6287280	Crazy.
6287321	6288082	I've never played it.
6288322	6289043	It's crack rock.
6289063	6291686	I mean, I've played a zillion and one tower defense games before.
6291707	6293048	It's just, you know, this is another one.
6293068	6293789	But it's cute.
6294390	6295071	It's pop crack.
6295492	6295852	Mm-hmm.
6295952	6296273	Mm-hmm.
6297014	6297414	Hey!
6297514	6300937	Speaking of other crack games, some people really love these games.
6301037	6303519	Muramasa, The Demon Blade, and Odin Sphere.
6304040	6308523	Yeah, these games are being remade in HD, if rumors are to be believed.
6308583	6309684	This is only rumor right now.
6310305	6315029	The re-releases are highly likely for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
6315369	6316210	Here's the giveaway.
6316250	6319993	They're being listed by the Australia Ratings Board as multi-platform.
6320433	6320993	Hmm.
6321594	6324636	Odin Sphere, of course, was originally on the PS2, Muramasa on the Wii.
6325076	6327657	That would be kind of awesome if those games were re-released.
6329439	6332821	The Last Guardian finally has a release date.
6332941	6333901	Holiday 2011.
6334602	6336963	You might remember this was the game they showed, I think, in a trailer.
6337463	6339525	Didn't they show this for the first time, like, last year's E3?
6340839	6343101	I don't know, but they finally showed it at Tokyo Game Show.
6343301	6344241	Another trailer.
6345002	6347624	Oh, this is the Ico Shadow of the Colossus.
6347824	6348444	Yes, yes.
6348624	6348964	Holiday 2011.
6349425	6350125	It looks epic.
6350185	6350766	I mean, I gotta say.
6350826	6351266	I'd play it.
6351326	6354128	Yeah, it has a big, cute, sort of puppy thing.
6354688	6355189	I'd play it.
6355309	6357550	Well, there's a whole little trailer here that was from Tokyo Game Show.
6357570	6358451	I'll play a little clip here.
6358471	6360012	I don't want to play the whole thing.
6360032	6361853	But you can see it's loud.
6361993	6362694	Excuse me.
6362854	6363894	I watched this the other day.
6363914	6364255	Look at that.
6364275	6365475	There's that giant puppy thing.
6365696	6368738	Yeah, I don't know what the hell it is, but I'd play the game.
6368758	6370499	It looks like it's going to crap on that guy.
6371259	6380144	All right, speaking of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, the collection that's been rumored for the past couple weeks, it's true.
6381044	6384386	It's HD remakes coming exclusively to the PlayStation 3.
6385607	6386727	They're also in 3D.
6389710	6419052	but whatever at least they're 2D as well yeah they're coming to the PlayStation 3 they won't name a release date they're just saying soon but of course the retailers were rumoring April 2011 Sony Computer Entertainment America actually confirmed later spring 2011 so it's coming there's box art and everything and there's a trailer for that as well the game looks sexy as hell and I'm going to admit I didn't really play these games the first time around I watched Loki play one of them
6419252	6421353	I watched a certain unnamed person play them.
6421573	6421913	Really?
6421993	6422273	Yeah.
6422313	6423593	Are they hot?
6423753	6428575	Well, all that Ico is, is this girl making a stupid noise following you.
6429015	6432316	And then Shadow of the Colossus is like, you're climbing a guy and killing him.
6432376	6432656	I don't know.
6432676	6434177	I mean, I'm sure it would be fun.
6434197	6437878	You make these sound so stupid, but they're like some of the highest critically acclaimed games.
6437898	6438958	It's like, I don't know.
6438978	6441779	It was boring to me, but I think if I played it, I'd probably like it better.
6442898	6445241	Comment from our chat room from Spazinator PSN.
6445301	6448646	Does that puppy thing remind you of the Luck Dragon from The NeverEnding Story?
6448927	6449587	Falkor?
6450208	6452171	Fuck yeah!
6452231	6452732	Kinda.
6452832	6454374	Didn't he always sound like he was high?
6454615	6455135	Falkor?
6455456	6457038	He's like, oh yeah.
6457178	6458540	Scratch my ear.
6461059	6463540	Also, get me some munchies, could ya?
6463980	6466541	I've been laying here for like six hours, really high.
6466861	6468201	Sorry, derailing.
6468401	6470602	So where, no, it's okay, it happens on this show as well.
6470942	6473142	So where is Frank West in Dead Rising 2?
6473582	6477963	He isn't showing up in the game, and you know, Frank West, of course, was the main character in Dead Rising 1.
6478003	6478244	Of course.
6478644	6479564	Well, he's been found.
6479584	6480424	He's covered wars, you know.
6480744	6480944	What?
6481684	6483185	I said he's covered wars, you know.
6483245	6483765	That's right.
6484345	6488687	He's coming to a new game called Dead Rising Case West.
6489068	6491629	That's right, it's an epilogue to Dead Rising 2.
6492349	6495751	Aha, so Dead Rising Case 0 was the prologue.
6496091	6498592	Case West will now be the epilogue.
6499033	6499333	Get it?
6500113	6503014	That's why you've seen photos of the two characters standing next to each other.
6503075	6504875	Case West is going to be a download title.
6505136	6507497	It's going to be exclusive on the Xbox 360.
6507997	6511899	It will have co-op play where one of you is Chuck and one of you is Frank.
6513729	6519192	Sorry to my gay friends, but no word about hot man-on-man action with the Chuck and Frank.
6519552	6520633	Boo!
6520893	6521794	Next topic.
6522434	6523675	No gayness in this one.
6525295	6529078	On that topic, DarkSakura, you've heard of the Doctor Who game, right?
6529718	6529938	Yes.
6530118	6535241	And considering now that Russell T. Davies is the head of Doctor Who, do you think there'll be any man-on-man action in the game?
6536641	6537742	We need Captain Jack in it.
6537762	6541285	We need Captain Jack and the 50 million gay kisses he has on Torchwood.
6541886	6542126	Yes.
6542486	6543587	Oh yeah.
6543607	6546329	Oh, you've heard about the new season of Torchwood.
6546369	6547690	The gay alarm is going off.
6548331	6549652	This show got too gay.
6549672	6550353	Good job.
6551073	6551754	Sorry, John Barrowman.
6551794	6552455	We're in Rob Network.
6553555	6554796	That's right.
6555276	6560517	We just got an order from the police department of Sacramento to turn down the gayness a little bit, please.
6561318	6563298	Too late.
6564459	6565819	How about some other news, Rob?
6567980	6574582	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has characters that make me absolutely, absolutely, really, really happy.
6575262	6575542	Horny?
6577521	6577981	Wow.
6578061	6579021	I thought that's what she was going to say.
6579081	6580982	Wasn't going to go there, but all right.
6581042	6581742	I said happy.
6583623	6584943	X23 is in the game.
6584983	6586163	That makes me happy.
6586904	6592505	As in the chick clone of Wolverine, who's actually kind of awesome.
6593065	6593405	Hot?
6593725	6594606	DarkSakura, hot?
6595626	6599227	I guess if you like... So then you would be a little horny.
6599447	6600347	Just kidding.
6600367	6601668	I would bite my butt, Rob.
6602968	6606189	And of course, you know, we also have Tron Bon in there.
6607530	6625093	and also other characters announced for Street Fighter 4 this is pretty cool is Yun and Yang so pretty cool from Street Fighter 3 I think that's pretty cool they were fun to play and Chun-Li
6626205	6626886	Do not like Chun-Li.
6627526	6630769	She's in every fucking Street Fighter game except the very first one.
6631770	6632571	Fighting Street.
6634272	6645081	And then IGN found a game-breaking bug in a certain game that we like to complain about sometimes, even though I don't think any of us in here have played it.
6646242	6648844	Metroid Other M. I just know it's crap.
6648864	6649164	Yeah.
6650565	6651086	3D Metroid.
6651166	6652887	I'm not passing judgment until I play it.
6654088	6657831	And Rice Princess doesn't like any of the 3D Metroid games, so she's biased.
6658151	6661153	I also don't like horseless carriages and metal birds.
6663215	6663976	Who are you?
6664436	6672442	At any rate, the bug, if you are in Sector 3 and a certain door stays locked, you'll be locked there forever.
6672622	6673243	You're just stuck.
6674424	6675905	Kind of like there being no boss at level 30.
6678340	6686683	and Nintendo did confirm it and they said that right now the only solutions are to load an earlier save or start over from the beginning.
6687204	6688404	What a solution!
6689084	6691886	They haven't said anything about fixing it.
6692346	6694787	They're like, duh, stupid, just restart the game.
6695447	6700829	And the best part is they can't fix it because the Wii doesn't patch games.
6701469	6705431	There's a potential that they can patch it through a firmware update.
6706611	6707052	They can't.
6707592	6707832	Poop.
6709382	6710263	Well, and good news.
6710423	6711303	Good happy news.
6712063	6712524	Stop it.
6712604	6714144	I know what you're going to do.
6714384	6714584	What?
6714624	6714825	Hi.
6714905	6715285	Fanfare.
6715865	6717566	I don't have a fanfare.
6717626	6717926	Hold on.
6718026	6720487	Well, then sing it.
6721767	6722427	Thank you, Irene.
6722628	6722868	Okay.
6722908	6723248	You're welcome.
6723488	6723808	No, no, no.
6723828	6724788	I'm getting your fanfare music.
6725309	6726369	But we already did it, Rob.
6726509	6726909	We're done.
6727790	6728770	You don't need to do it anymore.
6728830	6730291	It had the stamp of Irene on it.
6730391	6730611	Yes.
6731531	6731811	Hold on.
6731891	6732751	Okay, here's your fanfare.
6734832	6735192	I knew it.
6740598	6743239	One of the best shooting games ever.
6743859	6745200	And it's Treshar goodness.
6745240	6747300	And I have to say it's Treshar because it's treasure.
6748801	6749741	Radiant Silvergun.
6750141	6752482	Yay.
6753142	6755423	Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
6755843	6756904	Yay.
6757764	6761625	And it'll be out in 2011 exclusively on Xbox Live Arcade.
6762106	6765867	It will have updated graphics, online co-op, and an Ikaruga mode.
6767105	6767765	Icaruga?
6768206	6768586	Oh my.
6768626	6769226	That's always good.
6784296	6784616	Wow.
6784656	6786278	So that was a long time ago.
6786398	6790561	The last time I played Ikaruga was one of the boss fights in Tournament of the Champions.
6790601	6791461	Not Ikaruga.
6792042	6792922	Radiant Silvergun.
6793182	6794443	Last time I played Radiant Silvergun.
6794804	6795064	Oh, okay.
6796104	6799167	And I touched a Saturn copy at California Extreme.
6799387	6799967	It was pretty.
6800327	6801088	It was expensive.
6801168	6802449	They wanted like 600 bucks for it.
6802489	6804690	No, that's California Extreme!
6805331	6806372	Extreme!
6806652	6806852	Thank you.
6806872	6807252	Thank you, Eddie.
6807292	6808213	Extremely nerdy.
6808874	6809575	It was awesome.
6810275	6811596	So, Radiant Silvergun!
6812057	6813358	Dan, we're getting this!
6815040	6815840	He's so excited.
6816381	6817362	How about Twitter topics?
6817682	6817922	No.
6818042	6818383	Okay.
6820055	6838006	every week we read your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and I forgot to ask for them tonight so we have very few from tweeters who remember that we do this every week Rob fail that's alright we'll do a few well if you want if you wanted to get in a tweet and you forgot you could hurry up and send an email because I don't think DarkSakura has opened the mail bag yet so you can hurry yes don't
6839006	6840306	Alright, let's see.
6840426	6842187	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6842887	6844387	PodCulture sent a tweet.
6844447	6847207	It actually isn't really directly related to the show, but I thought it was interesting.
6847527	6849668	He says, Sorry gang, not going to make the live feed tonight.
6849728	6852148	Playing a bit of Phantasy Star Portable 2, then calling it a night.
6852508	6855709	By the way, code required for online multiplayer and PSP 2.
6855769	6858529	Now it looks like Sega has jumped on board with that whole thing.
6858929	6859369	Yay.
6861070	6867731	Blue Swim sends us a tweet with a story about Microsoft believes that Kinect will blow away iPad sales.
6870761	6871242	Good luck with that.
6871302	6873343	In a totally unrelated product comparison.
6874344	6875145	Seriously.
6876886	6878667	I don't see how that's going to work.
6878747	6879888	Christmas gifts, maybe?
6880109	6880789	I don't know.
6881970	6885453	I could see that because the Kinect is only $150.
6885513	6890557	The comments coming from Kudo Shunoda.
6890577	6892078	And the iPad is way more expensive.
6892615	6896356	The Xbox 360 is already selling better than the Wii and Sony right now.
6896396	6898497	Kinect's really just going to boost that to a whole new level.
6916363	6916763	Xbox 360 Launch
6936821	6938342	Here's kind of a side-related question.
6938362	6942663	Do you guys think that Xbox actually is not planning on another system in the next couple years?
6943603	6952806	Let me get to that in a minute, but first, A, they're going to sell more Kinects than Xbox 360s at launch, because there weren't any fucking Xbox 360s available at launch, remember?
6953286	6957868	Never forget, there was like no 360s anywhere for like six months.
6958188	6959748	They were in very limited supplies.
6960249	6961629	I see what you're doing there, you little...
6963895	6964195	Liar.
6964355	6964535	Yep.
6988988	6992909	They're going to name the Wii successor and I think that'll kind of be the first in a wave.
6993309	6996370	Probably Microsoft in about two years will announce their successor too.
6996790	7003931	I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of updates to current consoles going on is because A, it's all about the digital distribution and upgrades.
7004371	7009652	B, it's because of the economy and people don't have $400, $500, $600 to jump on a brand new system.
7012992	7014072	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7033857	7033957	Oh.
7035898	7036599	Clever!
7037619	7039540	Well played, Microsoft.
7040401	7041321	I'm on to you, though.
7041341	7049466	No, it also has its senses, and if the internal parts are getting too hot, which causes that, it actually shuts the system down before it will red-ring.
7050046	7050667	Oh, wonderful.
7051247	7052448	That is the worst solution ever.
7054816	7055416	Oh man.
7056316	7058477	Or as Frisbee in chat calls it, the Xbox 360.
7058577	7062438	Oh, guffaw, guffaw, guffaw.
7063778	7064718	Oh, good one.
7065718	7066538	Here's the thing though.
7066839	7076821	Don't be too excited for the next consoles because I'm going to tell you, especially probably from Sony's camp, the next series of consoles, one of them's going to get ballsy and it'll probably be Sony.
7077261	7078521	Totally digital distribution.
7079041	7079441	Just wait.
7080381	7081382	All digital distribution.
7081922	7083282	Then the games better be cheaper.
7084602	7084942	They won't.
7110182	7111802	Tiger Claws, send a link.
7111842	7118626	Speaking of Apple and apps and stuff, they rejected the onions shoot people point blank in the face game.
7118646	7119487	What?
7119607	7119967	Why?
7120007	7121348	That's really too bad.
7121368	7123729	There's actually a little trailer here that you can watch.
7125450	7126410	Am I vanishing?
7126891	7130673	Oh, this is a whole little... We're about to have a photo of Loki playing.
7130933	7131993	But apparently...
7133374	7135796	The Onion wrote about a fictional first-person shooter.
7135836	7140519	It's called Close Range, and you just repeatedly shoot people and animals point-blank in the face.
7140900	7142641	Wait, that's a game?
7142681	7145663	That's awesome.
7145703	7147584	You mean that's not every first-person shooter?
7148645	7157772	Video game fans are lining up today to be the first to purchase Close Range, the hotly anticipated video game in which players repeatedly shoot people point-blank in the face.
7158192	7160914	Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.
7162438	7162998	Thanks, Bobby.
7163058	7167420	Close Range is already being hailed by critics as the most important game of the year.
7167880	7173622	The first person shooter creates an immersive, richly detailed world where players shoot people in the face with guns.
7173942	7176543	Reviewers say it brings a new level of depth to gaming.
7176723	7183526	Just like great literature and film transports you to different worlds, Close Range transports you to a world where you fire bullets into an endless stream of faces.
7183826	7189208	Fans say it's the game's well-developed characters and storyline that make close range so compelling.
7189288	7194210	You just feel like you're inside this complex character who's thrust into a world where he has to blow people's heads off.
7194310	7202693	The plot follows AJ, a man with a mysterious past who must explode hundreds of thousands of human faces on a quest to save his kidnapped brother.
7203053	7204074	Who are you?
7204554	7205514	Someone who can help.
7206895	7208195	I know where your brother is.
7208475	7209136	Tell me.
7209376	7209876	Look out!
7210563	7213585	But Closed Range's single-player story is just the beginning.
7214005	7220489	Its outstanding multiplayer mode offers unparalleled interactivity by allowing players to blast each other's faces off.
7220609	7221889	It's completely open-ended.
7221929	7224971	You can shoot someone in the ear, but you can also shoot them in the eye.
7225171	7229574	With hundreds of hidden extras like side missions where players can take a break from shooting people in the face...
7230314	7232515	That is horrible.
7233816	7242060	And with the sequel, Close Range 2, Chainsaw Dawn, continuing the epic story next fall, Close Range fans have even more to look forward to.
7242761	7244762	For the Onion News Network, I'm Jeff Tate.
7245422	7248284	Wow, that was pretty amazing.
7248344	7251145	And I know that probably made for horrible radio, but they really did show...
7252466	7255708	They really did show people shooting at close range.
7256209	7258510	And then there was a horse and an ostrich.
7258730	7259851	I don't see the difference.
7259911	7262453	Isn't that every first person shooter game?
7263354	7270098	Anyhow, The Onion actually made it a game and submitted close range to sell on the App Store.
7271119	7273241	I would have bought it.
7273621	7275362	You know Loki's looking it up right now.
7275923	7277344	I already saw that news report.
7277364	7279285	We'll check the jailbreak for us.
7279385	7281627	Apple rejected it due to violence.
7282367	7306532	However, The Onion has revised the game and resubmitted it But good luck The iPad and iPhone app stores prohibits apps portraying realistic images of people or animals being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured, or injured That didn't look really realistic That's awesome They must be on lots of crack to have that be their idea of realism
7307847	7313815	Hey, also from Tiger Claw, I know he wants us to know that the SingStar dance track list is out.
7313855	7320685	That's right, because now, thanks to the PlayStation Move, not only do you get to sing, but you get to dance in SingStar.
7321146	7321486	Yay.
7321546	7324550	Irene's really excited for my next SingStar party, aren't you?
7324671	7324991	Totally.
7326152	7329974	Well, here's some of the hits you can do in this new game for Sing Star Dance.
7330475	7353790	NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye, Blondie, Heart of Glass, Cyndi Lauper, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For, KC and the Sunshine Band, That's the Way I Like It, LaRue with Bulletproof, Lady Gaga with Poker Face, New Kids on the Block with Hangin' Tough, Paula Abdul with Straight Up, Real to Real with I Like to Move It,
7355351	7364740	The Backstreet Boys with Everybody Backstreet's Back and Irene's personal favorite The Black Eyed Peas with Shut Up Shut Up!
7364921	7368264	Great, that's awesome
7369301	7370922	I'm pre-ordering that game, right?
7371302	7371603	Never.
7372903	7373324	Alright.
7374364	7375625	That's it for the Twitter topic.
7375645	7377807	Sorry to those folks that didn't get their tweets read.
7377827	7380368	You'll just have to tweet us a little faster next time, won't ya?
7380789	7381789	Back to some gaming news.
7381909	7387633	Loki, I hate to tear you away from Plants vs. Zombies, but I'm thinking you might want to read some stories for our listeners.
7387773	7388854	Sure, why not?
7389094	7390755	Or we can just watch more Onion videos all night.
7390835	7391816	Onion Lounge Radio, really.
7391876	7393037	You know, whatever.
7394297	7422467	EA apparently has not received significant backlash to their online pass remember the online pass is part of their project $10 which is the dumbest name for a project ever and it charges $10 for access to online games or online modes in games if you purchase the game used it says people know that bandwidth isn't free so the fact that we are diffusing online costs isn't seen as unreasonable
7423667	7426348	That makes no sense, I'll just say.
7427588	7429569	In other words, people aren't complaining enough.
7430129	7431369	That is a dumb excuse.
7431389	7434170	They're all, oh, well, bandwidth's not free.
7434970	7436151	Well, here's the thing.
7436751	7437651	They say it just like that too.
7438291	7439932	Bandwidth's not free.
7440452	7441212	They say it more like this.
7441552	7443153	Bandwidth is not free.
7444980	7445400	Thanks for watching!
7461488	7468778	But, you see, they were robbed of the $60 new game that that person might have potentially bought.
7468798	7471742	It doesn't matter, it's still the same amount of people playing online.
7471882	7478851	They wouldn't have bought because it's $60, they buy used games because they're cheaper, and they probably would have just pirated it.
7479383	7489631	Do I have to go down to their fucking offices with a basket of apples and show them, okay, if I give you an apple, okay, how many apples do you have?
7489651	7490291	You have one apple?
7490371	7495716	Okay, say you sell that apple used back to GameStop, you have now zero apples.
7495736	7497057	I don't think GameStop buys apples.
7498698	7499358	It doesn't matter.
7499518	7500739	Although I'd like to see you try.
7502321	7505023	Yes, I'd like to sell back this apple.
7505043	7505423	Okay.
7507982	7510523	We don't buy apples.
7510723	7514246	So EA, I purchased this apple from you for $60.
7515666	7516407	You have my $60.
7518328	7520810	I take this apple and give it to my friend Rob.
7522410	7526453	Rob has not paid you $60, but he'll be using this apple to play online.
7526913	7531256	I will no longer be playing online with this apple because I don't have an apple anymore.
7531676	7533236	How many people are playing online with this apple?
7533256	7533736	Wait, wait, wait.
7533796	7535557	But you said you brought a basket of apples.
7535777	7538337	So you actually have like 20 more apples sitting in the basket.
7538417	7538977	Exactly.
7539238	7541278	And I've paid for all those copies of the games.
7541738	7543698	I want to see these amazing online apples.
7543818	7546539	I'm just going to go online and download the apple for free.
7546979	7548199	That's what I'm going to do.
7549200	7550040	It comes down to it.
7550080	7551240	That's just a dumb excuse.
7551560	7556301	That would be like saying... Let's see here.
7557870	7582465	Rob, I went ahead and made this nice dinner out of food that I purchased from the grocery store However, for you to eat that dinner, you're going to have to pay that grocery store $10 Because they lost out the sales of you purchasing food from the grocery store Despite the fact that they still have the same amount of food in the grocery store Regardless, they've lost no money
7585194	7585654	I will not.
7586475	7587415	My voice must be heard.
7587836	7589617	The problem is they're not fighting.
7590037	7594099	They're basically just saying, oh, well, bandwidth costs money.
7594420	7596021	And gamers are like, oh, okay.
7596281	7596921	That makes sense.
7597862	7601964	Instead of going, wait a second, I paid them for that bandwidth already.
7603025	7610990	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeontradio.com, SpazinatorPSN says, that's like a GM complaining that a car dealership sells used cars.
7611930	7616033	DarkTetsuya says, wow, I haven't heard Loki say Apple this much since his latest Mac rant.
7617314	7619296	DarkTetsuya says, Apple Lounge Radio.
7620677	7625060	And lastly, Seg says, but I'm sure they sell lemons.
7631124	7637449	Here's my answer to why they haven't seen that much backlash yet as far as the online passing goes.
7637849	7641351	Because not a lot of people buy EA Sports games used.
7641712	7646855	I'm guessing that most people buy them brand new when they first come out because they have to have their EA Sports games.
7647416	7652740	And I'm sure that a lot of people that have bought EA Sports games are probably only buying one or two EA Sports games.
7653040	7657643	Not everybody's buying Tiger, NCAA Football, Madden, NHL.
7658504	7659444	No one's buying everything.
7661937	7665600	So I'm going to guess that's probably why that no one's bitching about it.
7665660	7672825	But I bet you anything if this comes out a Medal of Honor or something like that and a bunch of people are buying it used later on, there will be people bitching.
7675207	7683574	Xam in our chatroom says, Apple's online, the latest fruit-based MMORPG following Fruit Base Fantasy 11 and Papaya Star Online.
7684314	7689078	But remember, see, if you don't speak up, then they're just going to assume that everything is okay.
7689218	7691540	So, you know, whatever.
7692287	7693128	We tried, we tried.
7693168	7697472	Of course, their sales aren't going to hurt at all because, you know, Madden's going to be the top-selling game.
7697832	7711225	But, like, if, you know, EA, say, for example, puts out, I don't know, an MMO version of, like, Lilla's Pet Shop or something like that and charges $10 for online, I'm sure a lot of people won't buy it.
7711285	7711926	Actually, fuck that.
7711966	7713387	No one's going to buy that game anyways.
7713888	7714868	What am I talking about?
7714888	7715449	Terrible example.
7715489	7717391	Little girls everywhere want that game.
7718684	7719484	Hello Kitty Online
7739537	7741958	Hey, going over to the Kinect in Microsoft.
7741998	7745800	Some news about the whole camera scanning feature that's going on there.
7746080	7750582	You remember when they first showed Kinect in that whole little Milo demo?
7750602	7758025	They showed like, ooh, I'm going to draw Milo a picture and put it up on the camera and he's going to show me... That's a wonderful penis you've drawn for me!
7759085	7760948	Pretty much was the demo they were showing, right?
7761229	7768440	But then when they actually showed the games you could play, it was all flail 2000 and dance and wave my hands.
7768780	7772907	And there really was nothing about, oh, it reads paper or any of that stuff, right?
7773528	7773888	Well...
7775069	7780513	By the way, this is still about Milo, have you seen the new Milo demo video that they had out there?
7781253	7787397	I forget what conference it was being shown at, and this isn't a bad joke or anything.
7787717	7794321	They were actually showing it, apparently he's moved to the US because his family is conflicting or something like that.
7794721	7795061	DarkSakura.com
7813015	7814756	Seriously, it's Pedobear the game.
7815616	7819178	Anyways, back to the scanning stuff.
7819198	7823860	Maybe now's not a good time to talk about Connect Joyride, which is the game I was actually going to talk about.
7824620	7826861	They were showing off a demo of this at Tokyo Game Show.
7827641	7835184	Big Park, the developers behind Joyride, which is a Microsoft-owned studio, they actually have worked in some of the camera capture into this game.
7835604	7836525	Here's the weird thing.
7837285	7841787	What it does, when you do your vehicle customization options, you can pick your car's color.
7842147	7850431	But if you don't like the colors in the game, Kinect will look at an item that you put in front of the camera and put its color on the car.
7851812	7852832	Oh my god.
7852912	7857455	How long until a car that is colored the same color as someone's penis?
7857515	7858375	That's what I want to know.
7860436	7861076	Won't take that long.
7861096	7862157	That's really cool.
7864656	7867257	That's the wonders of modern technology.
7867337	7868657	It matches colors.
7869637	7870078	Good job.
7870878	7871458	Cocky.
7875099	7880620	By the way, you could also, by the way, capture textures and that whole thing in LittleBigPlanet.
7880740	7886422	Also, by the way, like, you know, last year or two years ago would already read pictures in front of the PlayStation Eye.
7886962	7888263	This actually isn't anything new.
7889083	7889563	Just so you know.
7890339	7890960	DarkSakura
7905416	7932546	To make Wii controllers as part of the Nike 78 project Where they asked 78 artists to be creative with their shoes And so what it does is actually it changes the way a lot of these games are played And I think that he's using Wii Sports Or one of these balance board games And using a chair So he's jumping up and down for doing the little dance thing
7933966	7938528	And then, but it looks like he can actually do the running in place stuff.
7938928	7940828	It looks like he's having an epileptic seizure.
7940868	7942429	Like, I'm sorry.
7943429	7948031	I'm just waiting for that dog in that one video to come out and push the chair before he sits down.
7948691	7949631	He falls on his ass.
7949651	7950451	Have you guys seen this video?
7950471	7950812	It's great.
7951052	7957974	I mean, it looks like, though, it totally adds a lot more of a different dimension to the game.
7958034	7959414	I mean, like, it could be more active.
7960355	7960935	Oh, it's Wii Boxing.
7961817	7963159	I'm a maniac, maniac That's what it looks like
7979395	7983097	I guess if you want to look more ridiculous doing stuff on the Wii, yeah.
7983677	7990740	But I mean, when he wasn't using the chair, it did look like he was actually kind of dancing along with the people on the screen instead of just using the balance board, you know?
7991240	7992160	It looked like it would be fun.
7993081	7996162	It was just weird that he had to keep sitting on that chair, but you know, whatever.
7996762	7998103	It's like using the bar in DDR.
7998703	8000184	Not gonna judge, not gonna judge.
8000324	8003525	Mailbag and the FUs of the Week coming up after just a couple more stories.
8003979	8004319	Loki?
8005440	8010744	Yes, apparently there's a new game coming out called Shadows of the Damned.
8011725	8012805	You said a bad word.
8013946	8014887	Yes, I did.
8016788	8024173	Apparently this is the long-awaited collaboration of Suda51, Akami, and EA.
8024974	8030158	And, of course, this new game is going to be a psychological action thriller.
8031038	8031198	And...
8032219	8035081	There's some Shadows of the Damned going on in the next room, right?
8035121	8040564	According to Suda, he and Mikami wanted to make this game for a long time.
8040604	8043026	He searched for the right publisher to bring it to the audience.
8043486	8047108	Finally, they said that they can reveal the game they've been working on together with EA.
8047348	8049149	It's expected to release in 2011.
8049329	8053712	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
8053752	8057875	I know he was working on another game also, which is kind of cool.
8058135	8061857	I believe Akira Yamaoka is doing music for that one, so that's pretty sweet.
8062901	8063321	What?
8064022	8069285	Yeah, well, Akira Yamaoka, you know, left Konami, so, and he's supposedly partnering with EA now, so this- Bravo!
8069385	8070405	Akira Yamaoka.
8071426	8073887	This is gonna be a heck of a game, but we don't know anything but a title, right?
8073927	8074448	And a little logo.
8074468	8075188	Nothing right now, yeah.
8075248	8076669	Not even a screenshot, nothing.
8076689	8077149	Nothing.
8077489	8081492	It's gonna be all, like, stick figures and psychological action.
8081552	8083813	It'll probably be a big thing at E3 next year, I'm imagining.
8084233	8086055	Oh, like Shattered Memories was?
8086995	8088817	That was a psychological thriller.
8089077	8091379	But that was also a different developer.
8091399	8093500	I know, it was shit.
8094601	8097123	I heard your strong feelings about this earlier.
8097964	8106190	Speaking of things that Irene is a big fan of, it was officially announced this week through Mila Jovovich that another Resident Evil movie is definitely coming.
8107352	8109813	What do you mean with that, like, open ending?
8109933	8110393	No!
8111174	8112274	Surely you jest.
8113414	8120677	Quote Mila Jovovich in the New York Magazine, quote, this new Resident Evil is the first one to ever open at number one worldwide.
8120737	8124539	It's the biggest movie in the franchise, so we're definitely going to make another one.
8125299	8130503	She's also asking fans to send suggestions for the next film to her Twitter page.
8131344	8143793	So if you want to tweet her and tell her some ideas, like make a movie that doesn't suck, you could tweet her at M-I-L-L-A J-O-V-O-V-I-C-H because you don't know how to spell it.
8144753	8145074	Alright.
8146894	8148995	Suggestion, do not make another movie.
8150515	8151075	Thank you.
8151776	8154636	You need to get a Twitter account just to tweet that to her.
8154697	8156617	I liked the last ones, honestly.
8156677	8158538	I haven't seen the very last one, but I want to.
8158878	8160798	Yeah, I didn't mind the first three movies.
8160838	8165200	The third one was kind of... But this one was just pretty horrible.
8165660	8166700	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
8192367	8192607	DarkSakura
8217881	8218444	Yes, I will.
8219689	8222020	Okay, this comes from Rini.
8224264	8225065	Greetings, OLR.
8225145	8232589	On episode 381, you lamented over Guitar Hero Warrior of Rock's ability to post accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook.
8232709	8239373	I should mention, Rock Band 3 also has media integration features, but they have a bit of use.
8239433	8243035	For example, you can make a setlist and post it for friends to see or try out.
8243435	8245456	Of course, you can throttle the frequency of posts.
8245957	8251300	Another concern with Rock Band 3 is promo DLC, which is going to be separate from standard DLC.
8251980	8254982	Just to clarify, this pro DLC is only for guitar and bass.
8255062	8257303	Pro keys and drums are included in the normal DLC.
8258003	8259124	There's... Sweet!
8259504	8272350	There's a lot more interesting details I could just gloss over, but rather than tire poor DarkSakura's windpipes, I'll just link you guys to a few sources to skim over interesting details if you want to bring up such as harmonics, making older DLC compatible with keys in pro mode.
8272771	8273771	So yeah, different stuff.
8274011	8275052	All stuff coming out of packs.
8275712	8276994	I am really excited.
8277154	8281639	I actually did not pick up on the fact that Pro Keys was gonna be just included.
8281679	8282981	That actually makes me really happy.
8284803	8285364	I'm smiling.
8286946	8288828	You just can't see it because it's radio, but I'm smiling.
8289821	8294963	Next email, hey Orange Lounge Radio, Haseo Sumirogawa here for the third time in this lovely marathon episode.
8295043	8295883	So this was, yeah, last week.
8295903	8296563	This must be an old one.
8297463	8301885	Okay, in an earlier episode I asked about a problem with downloading Bleach Heat The Soul 6.
8302765	8305386	And you guys said be more detailed, so here it is.
8305526	8308127	Okay, Bleach Heat The Soul 6 is a PSP game.
8308667	8310568	I downloaded it and it was a RAR file.
8312288	8314849	Oh, you downloaded a fake.
8315629	8321391	I can't help him with that unless he gets into something a little more legitimate.
8321931	8330373	I don't want to pay the extra cost of importing at $60 which is a bit ridiculous considering the extra $20 for next day shipping so they can kiss my butt on that front.
8330733	8333914	Actually... You can buy, by the way, import PSP games at Fry's.
8334794	8334814	I...
8337055	8339536	I actually, I'm going to take shit for this, but I don't care.
8339576	8340416	I've said it on the show before.
8340516	8343377	I'm not opposed to pirating imported games, actually.
8343737	8353219	Because I think if they are not going to take a chance and release it over here, then why should we pay all this money in import fees to when they're not counting on us for their success anyway?
8353279	8353779	You know what I mean?
8354219	8363682	Like, I know that's going to be frowned upon by some people, but I really don't pirate games here in the US, but the import ones, yeah, I have.
8365223	8366123	Thanks for reading my email.
8366143	8367464	Loyal listeners, Sumira Gala.
8367504	8367784	P.S.
8367864	8371506	People are wondering, I got the name from Haseo from .hack//G.U.
8371546	8371907	series.
8372367	8374268	Sumira Gala from the Reader Die TV anime.
8374288	8375629	Yes, I know it's a woman's last name.
8375789	8377110	It doesn't really matter whose last name it is.
8377490	8379431	But F you to all who have a problem with that.
8379611	8380212	Thanks again.
8381112	8384674	Also, if you can't help me via the radio, please do send a reply.
8386415	8387116	Forward it to Loki.
8388797	8389777	Loki can check the mailbox.
8394497	8402443	The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report Monday on crime statistics for 2009 that showed a 5.3% drop in violent crimes nationwide and a 4.6% drop in property crimes.
8423920	8433106	I'll be honest that they didn't define the drop context, whether it's per capita or total crimes, but all of these violent games poisoning our minds should turn us into gun-toting, cold-blooded killers.
8433747	8440051	I personally believe that not just games, but media and software use in general may be indirectly causing the drop.
8440551	8447576	Watching TV, playing games, browsing the intertubes, texting on our phones, and other sedentary activities are keeping us inside.
8448076	8453660	Not just that, and here's where I get a little controversial, I believe that violence is inversely correlated with average weight.
8455481	8456021	Think about it.
8456481	8459343	The more you are overweight, the less mayhem you'll be willing to do.
8459743	8460744	Fat equals peace.
8460904	8462104	Maybe that's stretching it.
8462485	8464385	That's discrimination right there.
8464466	8465706	Or stretch pantsing it.
8469168	8472009	Everyone slowly step away from Rob.
8473870	8479793	I'm trying to think if I've ever seen on the news somebody who committed a really horrible crime and if they were fat.
8479974	8480414	Like, I'm...
8481781	8486266	I'm sure there's been a few fatties busted.
8486286	8489028	The guy who shot John Lennon was pretty fat, if I remember right.
8489949	8491531	And that was a really recent story, too.
8492272	8494934	And I was commenting on the fact that you're like seven pounds, Rob.
8494974	8496255	I wasn't saying you're fat, it was the opposite.
8496396	8497096	Slim Jim over here.
8497236	8498117	This is from Robaba.
8498578	8499459	Anyway, next email.
8502261	8504664	Okay, this is from somebody.
8506041	8509904	Hey guys, I've been listening to the show for a year now, my first episode being the fuck show.
8511265	8513347	Anyways, I have something weird to share with you.
8514108	8519793	The very day after you guys had Omen in the cage match, DJ Hero posted a clip of it on YouTube.
8520153	8520653	Coincidence?
8520834	8522135	I think not, XD.
8522815	8524397	But one more thing.
8525882	8530986	Is that song you use at the end of the show every weekend behind the But We're Probably Right Anyway message?
8531066	8532246	I can't find it anywhere, thanks.
8532387	8534068	Oh, that's just the Closing Time MIDI.
8534128	8536069	It's an 8-bit remix of Closing Time.
8536109	8541973	There was some website, I don't even know where it came from, because it was actually sent to me by a friend, and I was like, hey, we'll make that the closing theme of our show.
8542614	8543594	And this is from Andy.
8543934	8547897	I believe some website did a compilation of a bunch of 8-bit versions of songs.
8548277	8549818	You could probably find it on YouTube.
8549858	8553061	Just Google YouTube 8-bit Closing Time, you'll find it.
8553801	8554622	High five, Actdeft, Viva Mexico
8581417	8587702	My best geek moment was definitely when both of my kids, 6 and 8, actually requested I run a D&D campaign for them.
8588282	8590124	Now we're playing the Diceless Marvel RPG.
8591225	8595148	As for anger management moments, my one real fight with my mom was when I was growing up.
8595268	8600492	At 14, she came into my room and just turned off my SNES because she thought I had had enough video games for the day.
8600832	8608538	Well, I thought differently and actually took her by the shoulders and proceeded to gently but firmly explain as I took her out of my room, locked the door, and turned my console back on again.
8608938	8610800	She never bothered me with time limits after that.
8611801	8612061	Wow.
8612501	8612822	Wow.
8613722	8619848	Finally, I've done the math, and considering my OLR cherry was popped somewhere in the to-go era... Is this guy skinny?
8621730	8622331	Let me finish.
8622451	8622671	All right.
8623071	8624292	Episode number now forgotten.
8624332	8628877	I'm not listed in the wiki, but it was the one where Rob came out of the closet for the audience.
8629758	8632460	I've now listened to at least 200... Episode one?
8632861	8633361	I know.
8634282	8634402	I've...
8637876	8641160	Not the gaydar Rob, just actually saying it.
8642161	8655938	It actually might have been a while, because I think at the beginning of the show, I actually purposely didn't want to say anything, because not that I was ashamed of it, I'm certainly not, but it's just kind of one of those like, I was like, it's not your business, it doesn't matter, for a while, and then I had to change my heart.
8656796	8658618	Well, to finish this email, sorry.
8659539	8667568	I've now listened to at least 245 episodes, or if you prefer, 621.5 hours, 2.5 hours a pop of OLR.
8668208	8675997	That's over 25 days of entertainment from you, so I'll just go ahead and thank you for one of the best months of my life and call it even for the next few episodes, okay?
8677757	8679438	Gracias, muchas, muchas gracias.
8679479	8681500	Sincerely, Dr. Noir, a.k.a.
8681520	8682561	the other Mexican recruit.
8683122	8683482	P.S.
8683802	8692669	This mail has been reviewed by two separate automated spelling and grammar censors and proofread by two young goats which were then sacrificed to the bard in order to keep the dark goddess appeased.
8694161	8697043	For the record, my name is spelled J-A-M-I-E, but thank you for trying.
8698244	8698824	You know what's funny?
8699264	8700766	And people in other countries get a bye.
8701406	8701586	Yes.
8701966	8702347	Yes, they do.
8702707	8703768	But I have to tell you this.
8704508	8708471	My first name was never misspelled until I moved to California.
8711253	8711893	Interesting.
8712393	8714575	I'm just saying, people in Alabama can spell my name right.
8716657	8717998	Next email.
8720038	8721359	And this is another one from Rababa.
8722139	8724700	I got what I believe can only be a phishing scam.
8725080	8730382	I get an email from Spoofed Blizzard inviting me to a beta of the next WoW expansion.
8730802	8735444	The link is probably to a fake WoW login server because it didn't actually start with a Blizzard or WoW address.
8736044	8738685	Also, I don't even have a WoW account which made it extra fishy.
8739065	8740006	PSA complete.
8740746	8747167	I also got to play DarkSakura Sunday because I got nauseous playing Trackmania.
8747367	8748088	Later, Robbaba.
8748808	8750168	No, sounds legit to me.
8750188	8751548	Yeah, you know what's funny?
8751588	8753909	I get emails all the time for Ion Online.
8754229	8757470	Like, you know, log in and get free gold for Ion Online.
8757510	8758750	And I'm like, I don't even play, dude.
8758770	8761950	It's like, I don't have an account, but okay, I'm gonna go do it right now.
8761970	8763771	By the way, I have to tell you what Tiara said.
8764991	8767212	If you've got import problems, Robbabil's bad for you, son.
8767252	8769172	He's got 99 problems, but a pirate ain't one.
8770976	8772697	Oh, happy talk like a pirate day to you too.
8773478	8780063	R. R. R. R. Derailed.
8780883	8781464	Kiel Hall.
8782864	8783305	Next email.
8784926	8788869	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.
8790710	8791451	The futures!
8792311	8796034	But the present brings the angst and the FUs of the week.
8813715	8814195	DarkSakura.
8816936	8820178	FU to Algebra.
8821919	8824520	Loki.
8824640	8828362	I'd say FU to actually I've got quite a few this week.
8829542	8832664	FU to Ford for making really shitty cars.
8832704	8841628	I've had to replace the thermostat housing on my car about three times now because it keeps breaking because it's made of plastic.
8842208	8871373	and because it gets cracks in it because it oxidizes and that sucks and it's about $300 each time so F you to that F you people that while they're grocery shopping aren't paying attention to where the hell they are and they're totally blocking the aisle they have their card on one side and they're just browsing totally oblivious to the world on the other side or they have like kids running around stuff like that you know so F you to them and people that like to um
8873402	8876943	I guess participating in idle chit chat in the grocery lines.
8877043	8877383	Thank you.
8879664	8883606	My FU of the week, I'm putting this in for Alan, goes to Del Taco.
8884806	8889448	No, I have a good reason because we actually went over to the drive-thru to get him a quick lunch that he could take on the train with him.
8889788	8895650	Yeah, we sat in the drive-thru for 35 minutes before we finally got our food and he missed his train as a result.
8896090	8901416	Now, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to have him here an extra day, but, you know, he had things he wanted to do.
8901616	8905240	So, kind of irritating when they take a very, very long time.
8905340	8906682	What was their explanation?
8907022	8907863	They didn't really have one.
8908484	8908584	Oh.
8908964	8909725	They were just busy.
8910786	8910907	Ow.
8911888	8912408	I know, right?
8912989	8916393	So, otherwise, F you to the fact I have to get up at 6 in the morning tomorrow.
8917093	8917193	Ugh.
8918334	8918654	When?
8919374	8919654	Sad.
8920174	8921715	Do you have any FUs of the week, Rice Princess?
8922575	8927236	Yeah, FU to Everything 3D and FU to Stinky Farts.
8928997	8929457	Excuse me.
8929497	8930257	That about covers it.
8931477	8931957	The Doctor.
8932557	8934978	FU to 3D as well because I hate 3D forever.
8935338	8935778	Found it.
8936558	8937159	Explosion.
8937559	8941280	And also FU to American TV for not having as many gay kisses as British TV.
8941440	8942880	Bring on the gay kisses, American TV.
8944830	8946451	I'll show you a gay kiss right now.
8946471	8949693	Oh my god, they really kissed.
8950553	8951173	They did it.
8952594	8954035	Alan, they totally kissed.
8954515	8954915	Alright.
8956436	8962259	Couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Laundry.
8962279	8963600	I should probably boot Skype, huh?
8963780	8965401	But not yet because we still got two more stories to go.
8966297	8977821	Yes, who would have thought that D3 would announce that they're releasing Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
8979122	8982163	Wow, that's wonderful news that I wish I knew earlier.
8983223	8983664	and DarkSakura.com
9001482	9002043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9018098	9018859	It was just fun, though.
9019320	9020341	And this game looks fun, too.
9020381	9022664	It's supposed to take place now in New Detroit.
9023124	9024285	The graphics are updated.
9024666	9030533	And by the screenshot, it looks like we get the jetpack from number two, which is pretty awesome.
9030613	9032635	So I am very looking forward to this game.
9032655	9033837	It's supposed to be coming out in February.
9035298	9053796	SSJ100 Matt says the game is doomed and he actually says doomed it's gonna be awesome I don't care well I had no idea this game was gonna be coming out and I'm really happy that no one seemed to care that Loki you know Loki is saying this for the very first time I mean on this program
9055230	9061195	One more news story for you guys, and it has to do with a new world record in video games.
9061635	9063216	And the winner is Mafia 2.
9064537	9065017	Yay.
9065278	9066859	And what did Mafia 2 get?
9067279	9073544	Well, Mafia 2 uses the word fuck more than any other video game.
9073904	9074064	Yay.
9074724	9075645	Yay!
9075985	9079986	They won the award for most swearing in a video game.
9080247	9080827	That's right.
9080887	9081747	The fuck they did.
9083228	9089110	House of the Dead Overkill was the previous title that had 189 uses of the word fuck.
9089270	9089610	What?
9090011	9092452	Well, you know, fuck or fucking or motherfucker.
9092812	9093692	House of the Dead?
9093912	9097794	But now, apparently... It's the new Wii game.
9098094	9099735	The Wii game that came out a couple years ago.
9099855	9100015	What?
9100655	9105381	Mafia 2 has more than 200 instances of... Let me interrupt you again, robot.
9105641	9105922	Fuck.
9107484	9108204	What the fuck did you say?
9108224	9110027	I couldn't hear, I was talking.
9111448	9112608	Congratulations.
9112708	9119470	I mean, you guys, that's just really immature to say fuck as many times as possible in a short period.
9119510	9120670	That's really immature.
9120730	9124211	Because we've never had a fuck show.
9124291	9124571	No, no.
9124611	9131873	That would be extremely fucking immature and we would never do anything like that because we're intelligent gamers.
9132293	9132953	We're classy.
9133053	9133833	Stop saying fuck.
9135455	9137196	Classy like the Playboys that were in Mafia 2.
9137577	9139518	Why don't you give us a call and we'll talk.
9139538	9143901	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9144361	9146743	We'll let Rice Princess answer all the calls tonight.
9146763	9147443	Does that sound like fun?
9147463	9148444	You want to answer the calls tonight?
9148624	9149025	Yeah.
9149085	9149425	Sure.
9149505	9150886	I'm classy as fuck.
9150906	9151386	All right.
9151947	9154268	Rice Princess is going to answer all the calls for us tonight.
9154549	9154809	Okay.
9154829	9160633	So call and talk to Rice Princess at 1-877-GAME-OLR and she will talk to our listeners.
9161335	9163476	and don't ask me anything stupid.
9164196	9165456	I'll jump in and help if you need it.
9165596	9165896	Okay.
9166096	9167336	I'll answer the stupid questions.
9167517	9167797	Okay.
9167837	9169277	Just say, Rob, this is a stupid question.
9169577	9171277	No, don't make the listeners feel bad.
9171437	9175138	Can I just give you a signal like, Rob, this is a stupid question?
9176019	9176639	Yes, you can.
9176819	9177079	Okay.
9177199	9177719	All right, here we go.
9177739	9178499	We got a call coming in.
9178519	9178779	You ready?
9179179	9179479	Yeah.
9180520	9180980	Hi.
9181380	9182980	You're on OLR person.
9183240	9183520	Hi.
9183740	9185021	Select the Zaku right here.
9185401	9185881	Hi.
9185901	9185941	Hi.
9187082	9188163	Yeah, I know.
9188303	9191006	I thought Sky was going to be on, but... Oh, sorry.
9191386	9192847	This is a stupid question, Rob.
9192867	9193888	I guess you should take over.
9193908	9201655	Well, I did IMU within the chat, and I have good reason to be here tonight.
9201895	9203477	Alright, what's your good reason?
9204157	9209442	You know, I actually attended that Halo Reach launch party that Best Buy threw last week, you know, in the city.
9209943	9211124	I actually got in as VIP.
9212898	9215740	Ooh, how did you get in as VIP, Fancy Pants?
9215940	9218862	Let's just say it's through the company I work for.
9219683	9221424	And they actually do business for Best Buy.
9221444	9224827	They actually build some of their apps for stuff like Reward Zone.
9224867	9226508	So you had to give a reach around for reach?
9227341	9228442	No, I actually got in.
9229223	9231024	I actually got in through those connections.
9231064	9236729	But yeah, pretty much it was just typical fanfare launch party with a lot of people trying to get in VIP.
9237349	9242574	But most of the folks, all it was is just like playing Halo Reach before midnight.
9242634	9244816	Wait, what did the VIP people get?
9244916	9245316	What made you...
9246477	9247998	Well, I already know.
9248038	9250020	You're VIP because you listen to this show.
9250080	9255003	But what did VIP get that the little peons waiting in line did not get?
9255063	9256364	Did you get the strip bus?
9256424	9257505	A full-service bar.
9257565	9259146	We had our own balcony section.
9259867	9262509	A full-service bar.
9262909	9263790	Yes, exactly.
9265663	9266544	Yeah, we had a full bar.
9267264	9268305	So how many people were there?
9268645	9271186	What did they do that was... Did they have, like, a rock concert?
9271206	9271466	I don't know.
9271486	9271907	What did they do?
9271967	9272907	A rock concert?
9272947	9280852	There was one person, I forgot his name, Kid Cudi or something, who was supposed to have played, but he didn't play exactly, you know, before midnight.
9281232	9285354	But by the time, you know, we left after midnight, he actually got on stage.
9285374	9294820	There's something about him just, like, being, you know, the unprofessional artist that he... He opened for Lady Gaga once when I saw her, and he's that guy, he just...
9295160	9296061	Day and Night.
9296562	9297383	That's him, right?
9297403	9299025	Yeah, something like that.
9299045	9299666	I don't care.
9299706	9301068	Okay, he had the crap song in DJ Hero.
9303601	9304602	Day and Night
9331801	9332521	on a Monday night.
9333102	9333762	Were there strippers?
9335023	9346892	No, there weren't any strippers, unless you count all the fanboys that were actually donning Halo clothing, such as the plasma swords and whatnot.
9347212	9349974	How many women were in line for Halo Reach compared to men?
9349994	9351696	There was a lot of people outside, actually.
9351796	9353517	It was literally stretching around the block.
9353537	9353617	He's
9354397	9357618	But they were outside and not actually in the line waiting to buy the game, right?
9357638	9358338	No, they were still inside, though.
9358358	9360379	There were people waiting to get in.
9360419	9362599	That's the thing.
9362639	9365860	But you got to sit up on the balcony and just judge them all, right?
9365880	9367681	Of course, because you know what?
9368081	9369921	I was connected.
9370321	9371982	Like I said, I work for the company.
9372122	9375183	Our company does business with Best Buy, and so they hooked us up.
9375903	9376703	So I thank them for that.
9377637	9379759	Let me guess, you're talking about U-Beat.
9402523	9410011	Yes, on the iPad, which makes a lot of sense given the fact that it's touch-based and the platform is there.
9410612	9421704	That means arcade owners, as much as I respect them, they won't have to shell out tons of money for something that may or may not succeed on that medium.
9422164	9424667	In other words, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
9427310	9427750	That's good.
9427770	9434553	I mean, it's a good... Look, I'm more of an Android developer, but even though I have an iPod Touch, I do respect the platform.
9435454	9438515	But I don't like the way they... You know, I don't like Apple's censoring.
9438655	9441076	How much do you think they'll charge for Ubeat?
9441256	9441677	99 cents?
9441697	9441677	$4.99?
9442217	9444398	I'm pretty certain it'll be $5 at most.
9444418	9444998	You know what they'll do?
9445018	9448199	I bet you it's like 99 cents and then like a dollar a song.
9448560	9449360	Yes, exactly.
9449380	9450560	Like they're doing with DDRS.
9450881	9451221	Gross.
9451974	9456939	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but any other thoughts on the Halo Reach party?
9456959	9461743	If you could sum up the Halo Reach launch party in your VIP access in one word, what would it be?
9462043	9462423	Sausage.
9465967	9467948	Damn good time for free.
9468109	9468789	That's too many words!
9469390	9469890	Have a good night.
9470511	9471011	Alright, night.
9473142	9481046	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and tell us about your VIP treatment and full service.
9481286	9481846	Whoa.
9482066	9484607	I know, right?
9489029	9491770	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9492130	9492810	Who's this?
9494291	9494871	It's Con.
9495651	9497292	Hi, whatever you said.
9498892	9499973	What's your question?
9501701	9516533	I was wondering if you guys had heard about the Fable 3 book that's going to be published Cool, continue No, he asked a question, dummy Cool, continue The Fable 3 book What about it?
9517293	9520956	I don't know much about this either, tell us about it It's like a fantasy book?
9522557	9527822	Yeah, it's actually not Fable 3 It's going to be taking place between Fable 2 and Fable 3
9534272	9540314	What's to stop me from going into Barnes & Noble and just copying the code from the book and running home and cashing it in before someone else can?
9541074	9543835	Rude.
9544955	9548516	Maybe they have it in plastic wrap or something and you, I don't know, set off alarms.
9549017	9551357	He'll set off an alarm if you break the seal.
9551437	9552217	Exactly.
9552758	9554638	The Master Chief comes down and blows your head off.
9555298	9555999	Close range.
9556659	9557339	Oh, God.
9559266	9560346	Are you a big fan of Fable?
9561206	9562747	I'm curious about this new game.
9562807	9567168	I don't know, it didn't seem that different from 2, from what I played, but I heard they really improved co-op.
9568708	9570848	I am really jealous that you did get to play it.
9572189	9574089	Yeah, I am a pretty big Fable fan.
9574649	9585772	I'll tell you, when I played it, Kine, I ran around in a giant chicken suit for like 10 minutes, and I had no idea what I was doing, and I felt like I was playing Furries the game.
9587012	9587312	Awesome.
9588939	9591642	Oh yeah, just the one time, just the one time I think it would be funny
9607543	9609704	Yeah, funny and arousing.
9614247	9621852	Do you think that there's enough fable mythos out there and enough world that they've constructed out of the games that will make for pretty decent fantasy novels?
9622052	9625014	Because, you know, it's not like novels for video games is anything too new.
9625094	9627055	I mean, Warcraft has a bunch of them.
9627355	9628876	Even Halo has novels.
9629056	9629676	Resident Evil.
9629716	9630397	Resident Evil.
9630417	9635160	You know, a lot of games, the FX9 novels back in the day, Castlevania, Blaster Master, heck yeah.
9635760	9637621	Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.
9637721	9640703	Is there enough substance in Fable to lend itself to books?
9640884	9641444	Well, you think?
9643065	9643825	There should be.
9645006	9650570	And besides, they have someone from, I think it was Wizards of the Coast, writing the novel.
9650610	9653572	The makers of, like, Dungeons and Dragons, I think.
9654850	9658691	Oh, and now Irene likes Dungeons & Dragons, so maybe you should get... Why don't you play Fable?
9658751	9659571	It's actually kind of neat.
9659591	9660071	I don't know.
9660732	9662312	Because I'm too busy playing D&D.
9662332	9663712	What a good answer!
9664853	9666793	Well, you put me on the spot, okay, you asshole?
9667293	9668414	That's what we do here on the show.
9668434	9672795	Because it's expensive and not a lot of people have the money to turn off on a $60 game.
9672955	9674555	Wait, what console is it for?
9674595	9676916	It's for the... It's for the Xbox 360, your favorite.
9677202	9678403	There's your answer.
9679944	9680625	Ding, ding, ding.
9680665	9681706	It's not my fault you're poor.
9682126	9682426	All right.
9682446	9683647	It's not my fault you're an asshole.
9683867	9684368	All right.
9684708	9685388	And you smell.
9687230	9688511	Let's see what else I want to ask Kaim.
9688551	9688891	I don't know.
9689552	9692134	Quickly, anything else you're looking forward to this holiday season?
9699860	9705264	I'm not looking forward to anything until next year when Metal Gear Rising comes out.
9706166	9708207	Ah, that is going to be a very popular game.
9708247	9710948	So no interest in the motion control stuff.
9711028	9712588	No Kinect, no Move in your future?
9714329	9720871	When they come out with the Kinect feature in Fable 3 where I'm able to growth the other player, sure.
9723312	9723692	All right.
9724352	9725153	We'll leave it at that.
9725253	9726173	Have a good one, Kine.
9726213	9727353	Thanks so much for the call.
9728014	9728594	We'll see you around.
9728614	9729334	All right, you guys.
9730137	9730777	Later, you too.
9730837	9731137	Bye-bye.
9731717	9732057	Bye.
9755442	9755762	Okay.
9755822	9762924	Which, wow nerd, the Tauren actually had an ability called Planes Runner in the early days of WoW.
9763104	9763865	I remember that.
9763885	9769506	That's right, where they could actually be the mounts themselves, but they were patched in with Kodos in a later expansion.
9769726	9771247	Aren't druids kind of like that too?
9771367	9773728	Like they can just have their own flying shit?
9774468	9774648	Yes.
9774908	9775088	Okay.
9775108	9776928	How about another call?
9776968	9777469	You ready, Irene?
9777669	9778009	Yes.
9779264	9779944	Hi, Ryan!
9781365	9782005	Oh, damn.
9782706	9783466	Fuck you.
9783846	9785087	I'm booting you from the guild.
9785947	9786467	Whatever.
9786867	9788848	I'll GK you quicker than you could me.
9789568	9791289	Oh, in fact, look, I'm on the game right now.
9791549	9792490	Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
9792890	9794411	Radio 101, real quick, Irene.
9794771	9801294	Even though their name comes up on the screen, you're supposed to, for radio's sake, just play stupid and say, Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9801334	9801734	Who is this?
9801834	9804055	Even though you can clearly see his name is Ryan B.,
9805427	9806290	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
9806311	9807736	It sounds weird on the radio.
9807756	9809302	Oh, his name is Ryan B?
9809322	9810085	What?
9810105	9810587	Stop it.
9811129	9811329	What?
9812045	9813746	You're giving away personal information there.
9813786	9815087	I'm not going to give away the whole thing.
9815447	9816148	I didn't say the whole thing.
9816848	9819470	But take it off your Skype info.
9819490	9824594	You can all see it in our studio.
9824974	9826775	Because otherwise you sound like Miss Cleo.
9827296	9829897	That's because I am Chad.
9829938	9832860	I already know your name, Chad.
9832880	9835621	How can I help you today, Ryan?
9836742	9839044	Another reference that most of your listeners probably don't get, Rob.
9839762	9840162	It's true.
9840182	9841343	You're like, Miss Cleo, who?
9841603	9842224	I know, right?
9842764	9843004	Indeed.
9843024	9843344	Anyway.
9843644	9844305	Oh, sorry, Irene.
9844425	9844645	Oh, yeah.
9845025	9845846	What do you want, Ryan?
9846886	9847127	You.
9849808	9850228	Gasp.
9851109	9851589	Drama.
9852390	9854971	Okay, so what do you really want besides me, everyone?
9855191	9855412	Me.
9857473	9858674	Oh, that's the truth right there.
9858894	9859354	All right, come on.
9859394	9859694	No, really.
9859714	9860955	What do you want?
9861135	9861615	Oh, no.
9861635	9865818	I was just calling in to see how excited you are about Civ V coming out this coming Tuesday.
9866656	9871779	You know, I am not excited to spend $50 on a game I'll probably play twice.
9872560	9877683	Because of the stupid WoW and all the stupid time sink I spent on that game.
9878544	9879484	But I love my guildies.
9880105	9883127	Yeah, I see how much you've been spending time on my gift for you.
9883827	9884567	Well, right?
9884968	9886889	Do you know how much I've played StarCraft 2?
9886949	9887749	Not enough.
9887789	9889090	No, I understand that completely.
9889571	9890071	Not enough.
9890231	9892953	Very time consuming, especially with everything coming out now for it.
9892993	9893213	Yeah.
9893473	9910436	the bummer with starting a late raiding schedule like our guild did is that like now we don't have that little like usually raiding kind of comes in cycles and the content first comes out you raid it a million times and then it kind of dies off and that's your time to go play other games we haven't had that
9911456	9932081	so if I want to go play like you know what the word late and raid is all in the same sentence I mean you guys what 8 o'clock your time by the time I get out of it it's about 3.30 in the morning for me not my fault you joined the West Coast Guild alright anyway for the listeners that don't play WoW is there anything else on your mind tonight?
9932682	9937225	No, the whole, the good old gaming, GOG, that's a whole ruse.
9937385	9943269	We'll figure that out, come by Wednesday when they announce that they're actually taking their stuff out of beta and actually going live.
9943309	9948372	There has been reports now that it's claiming that it has been all been one big ruse.
9948492	9952154	And now they're probably going to pay dearly for what they did to all their paying customers.
9952294	9953075	Are they dicks or are they dicks?
9953095	9957878	I hope they have something in store for them because a lot of people are going to still be upset by all that.
9959389	9960270	Are you going to be upset?
9960290	9961851	Are you going to boycott their website?
9961871	9963253	And I'm never shopping here again.
9963793	9964634	No, not really.
9964654	9966276	I never bought anything from them in the first place.
9966296	9967697	I'm not even the least bit worried, so.
9968458	9972081	I bet you, like, half of the games that they have, I already have.
9972201	9979388	So, I mean, like the Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, all the old games, I'll buy Dirt Keep anyway, so I'm not even the least bit worried, so.
9980339	9980679	Alright.
9980739	9981820	But you know, people are going to.
9981900	9982781	People are going to be like that.
9982821	9984482	People are going to be like, why did you pull this on us?
9984682	9986163	We thought you were being for real.
9986183	9990145	A lot of people didn't know what was really going on and now you do this.
9990245	9992247	And it's like, well, you know, screw you.
9992307	9995929	I'll find another place to buy the game or torrent or whatever, so.
9996913	10005004	Tiger Claw in chat says, I'm really curious to hear how Rob sounds like while playing WoW.
10005044	10005965	I mean, how he acts.
10006045	10008068	I hope it's not like that Onyxia wipe guy.
10008669	10013194	How do I sound playing WoW, Ryan, since you've been on Ventrilo with me playing World of Warcraft?
10015464	10016584	No, I'm kidding.
10016604	10017785	No, you sound like you do now.
10019826	10022427	It's like we pretty much, you know, it's normal.
10022607	10025449	I mean, nobody gets really too crazy in there.
10025469	10027349	And I like to do my wacky DJ voice.
10027490	10030071	No, you do not do your wacky DJ voice.
10030091	10032612	Hey, everybody, let's go to the summoning stone.
10032692	10033492	All right.
10034833	10062930	GK Let's go over to Tassel Ha for the traffic Alright Which is the best name ever because Dragonlance is awesome I couldn't do that Watch Wednesday I'm gonna do that Alright you guys, it's 8 o'clock Let's all get to the stone We're gonna get some Leap Purples tonight Tonight we're gonna get past the Blood Queen No you're not I'm hanging up on you, take care Bye
10066198	10066878	I love WoW calls.
10067639	10068099	Me too.
10068639	10075103	Because there's not enough WoW chat on this show that I want to start a whole other WoW show because there's not enough of them.
10075443	10079065	I hope there's people out there that would listen to a Robin Extra for a WoW show.
10079545	10080346	I might.
10080626	10081186	I don't know.
10081226	10082147	At least we'd have half a listener.
10082207	10083187	Aren't I confident?
10083327	10083648	Yes.
10084508	10085268	All right.
10087550	10088910	Let's see.
10088930	10091532	SSJ100Matt says, you should celebrate this call by having a cupcake.
10094429	10095750	That's a total inside joke.
10095790	10096390	That's very rude.
10096670	10097851	That's brilliant.
10097951	10098772	That's very rude.
10099012	10099832	You ready for another call?
10099933	10100173	Yes.
10102014	10104916	Hi, you've reached Orange Slut Radio.
10105556	10106237	Who is this?
10107257	10108878	Hi, this is Dazzy Neater.
10109519	10111300	Hi, what's up?
10113221	10122707	Well, I just want to pass along a little tidbit, a bit of information to whatever listeners there are out there that's not in chat.
10124179	10132503	Basically, there's an anime show that I just discovered called Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.
10132963	10133603	Just now?
10135344	10141607	I just discovered Hoarders, and that's been on for like a year and a half, and I'm just finding out about it.
10141667	10142467	So, you know what?
10142507	10142988	Back off.
10143108	10143848	Judging you.
10144788	10145649	Sorry, continue.
10145909	10146129	Sorry.
10147309	10152052	Basically, I just discovered Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood myself.
10153533	10164661	and it's basically like a remake of an earlier show with the same name and it's pretty damn good.
10166222	10180071	In fact, I have no idea if it's on DVD or Blu-ray or anything like that but I happen to know that it is available for digital download.
10181892	10182613	If you want to
10183496	10185978	Kind of like risk going that route.
10186479	10201612	Again, as I complained about digital download before, but at least right now, the first 13 episodes are actually on sale on PSN for like 99 cents each.
10203874	10210120	It's cheap, but at the same time, if you guys have listened to my
10211164	10216466	Calls a few months ago, there's kind of a risk with digital downloads.
10218567	10220828	So if you want to take the risk, go for it.
10222569	10225350	Or if you want to save some money, go ahead.
10225490	10230953	If you don't think it's worth the risk, then look for a physical copy.
10232653	10236395	So all together to get the whole series, it's like 14 bucks basically?
10236415	10238116	What, 13 episodes, 99 cents a pop?
10240012	10246237	Actually, it's only the first half of the series that's on sale.
10247157	10248658	I think there's like 25.
10248718	10249679	That's how they get you.
10249979	10254782	They sucker you in to buy the first half, and then they're like, oh, but the second half is double the price.
10256604	10257664	Exactly like that, Rob.
10258705	10260226	That's what they do at Sony headquarters.
10262395	10269237	Yeah, the weird thing is, though, you know, I'm not totally sure how Microsoft does their video marketplace.
10269277	10270618	I really haven't used it yet.
10271398	10281601	But I know at least over on PSN, you know, a lot of times they'll have, like, weekly sales on certain things, you know, wherever it's half off for that week.
10282582	10288984	And a lot of times they even give away, like, pilots to shows, you know,
10289787	10308426	for free, and the whole thing, you know, hey, you know, this pilot that I got for free is good, you know, might as well buy the rest of the series, you know, but, you know, like I said, there's, you know, you know, the inherent risk of your system fucks up, you know, uh,
10309909	10315894	There's a chance that unless you play your cards right, you could lose out on the content that you bought.
10315954	10318356	And you have to demand to speak to a supervisor, correct?
10318457	10322860	Based on what I learned in your previous calls about Sony Trauma.
10324101	10332728	Yeah, luckily, at least in the situations I've been in, I may have to work it out.
10334570	10336431	So, like I said earlier in the call, it's
10338247	10339548	Way out the pros and cons.
10340229	10342831	I have a solution to all of your Microsoft problems, by the way.
10343171	10344332	This is Sony problems, though.
10344572	10345513	Sony problems, whatever.
10346714	10347975	Hook up a computer to your TV.
10349095	10349736	Seriously.
10349876	10350537	No more problem.
10351197	10351838	It works for us.
10352518	10354079	Can I ask you a question?
10355480	10356921	Not to completely derail what you were saying.
