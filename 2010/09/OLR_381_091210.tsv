55000	57000	Orange Lounge Foodio going on over there
57000	59000	I slept most of the day
59000	61000	Awesome, Orange Lounge Nappio
63000	66000	I took an awesome nap yesterday actually
66000	68000	And that's how I was able to stay up late
68000	71000	Because I went clubbing and I was able to stay up until like 2am
71000	72000	It was fun
72000	73000	It sounds like you had a good time
73000	74000	I had a great time
74000	78000	I'm just very proud of myself because I used the cucumber that I grew myself
78000	82000	And I made myself some salad and it's fantastic
82000	84000	Soon you're going to be moving into a commune
84000	86000	And starting your own
86000	87000	Okay
87000	89000	I have five plants that I'm growing in the backyard
89000	92000	And three of them are like stuff to season with
92000	94000	Remember the fort?
94000	95000	The fort?
95000	96000	The fort
96000	98000	It was, oh this was years ago in OLR history
98000	99000	This was probably around like
99000	101000	When DDR Angel first started coming to the show
101000	104000	Probably around like episode like 30-ish right
104000	106000	And she had a friend
106000	109000	And I can't remember the dude's name
109000	111000	I'm a horrible, well I remember his real name
111000	112000	I don't want to say it on the show
112000	114000	It was D-U
114000	115000	Yeah
115000	116000	Yeah okay
116000	117000	I think I remember because
117000	118000	Right?
118000	120000	But he lived out in the middle of nowhere right
120000	121000	And to get to his house
121000	124000	He had to go by this place in the middle of nowhere
124000	126000	With all these signs that were like keep out
126000	128000	And trespassers will be shot on sight
128000	130000	And it just looked like some dude
130000	132000	Has had himself holed up in there since the 60s
132000	134000	And we decided to call that the OLR fort
134000	135000	Oh yeah
135000	136000	And that's who we're all going to move into remember
136000	137000	I remember
137000	138000	The fort
138000	139000	Oh
139000	140000	I can't remember all this stuff
140000	141000	Oh good times
141000	143000	Your brain works better than mine does today
143000	144000	That's alright
144000	147000	Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki
147000	148000	Hello
148000	149000	How are you?
149000	150000	Hi
150000	151000	Happy birthday Loki
151000	152000	Thank you
152000	153000	Is your mic on?
153000	154000	I don't know if we're even hearing you
154000	155000	It is on
155000	159000	It is on but for some reason we are not hearing you at all
159000	160000	I screwed with the volume
160000	161000	I don't think we screwed with it at all
161000	162000	Are you guys hearing Loki?
162000	163000	I have the crappy mic
163000	165000	I don't know what's going on here
165000	167000	Live radio and I'm not sure
167000	168000	I guess we are hearing Loki
168000	169000	He's just not as loud as the others
169000	171000	No I'm not even sure
171000	173000	No you're not on at all
173000	175000	That's oh you know what
175000	176000	Good ol'
176000	177000	Ah they plugged me in the wrong hole
177000	178000	There you go
178000	179000	Hi Loki
179000	181000	See this is what happens when you put it in the wrong hole okay
181000	183000	Let's try that again
183000	185000	And the one and only tech master Loki
185000	186000	Hello
186000	187000	Hi how are you doing?
187000	188000	I'm tired
188000	189000	I plugged it in the out hole
189000	190000	Oops
190000	191000	That's what happens
191000	193000	Well happy birthday a little late
193000	194000	Thank you
194000	195000	That's right
195000	197000	Never forget September 11th Loki's birthday
197000	199000	No I'm being a little bit silly
199000	202000	You don't have any tragedies on your birthday do you?
202000	204000	Ah no but I do have a victory
204000	205000	My birthday
205000	208000	There's two reasons my birthday rocks
208000	211000	One it's the day that Strom Thurmond died
211000	215000	And B it's the day that sodomy laws were overturned in Texas
215000	216000	That's what I get on my birthday
216000	218000	See my birthday was the Waco thing
218000	219000	Oh was it?
219000	220000	Yeah
220000	222000	Oh no no tragedies on my birthday yet
222000	223000	Just victories
223000	224000	Bitch
224000	229000	So talking about something funny made out of tragedy I guess
229000	233000	There's this pet and feed store that's near my house or whatever
233000	237000	And they have this horse statue that's out in front of
237000	240000	Like a full size horse statue that's out in front of their building
240000	242000	And they dress it up you know to
242000	245000	For like Halloween or you know St. Paddy's Day
245000	249000	All the different stuff they dress it up themed like that
249000	253000	So they decided hey we're gonna dress it up for 9-11
253000	260000	And so this horse has a replica of the twin towers on its back
260000	261000	And it's like
261000	263000	That almost sounds tacky
263000	265000	It is extremely tacky
265000	266000	I get wanting to be patriotic
266000	271000	And I do think they kind of should make a day out of 9-11 as a remembrance
271000	273000	And a day to kind of celebrate all things American
273000	276000	Although I realize it's also like the 4th of July as it is
276000	277000	But you know what I mean
277000	282000	Like it's too bad that that had to happen on your birthday
282000	285000	But it's just you know some people are born on Christmas
285000	289000	Some people are born on you know the day sodomy laws are repealed
289000	292000	Some people are born on 9-11
292000	295000	And you know it's just a birthday
295000	296000	Yeah what can you do
296000	300000	At least if you're born on Easter you don't always have to have it again on Easter
300000	304000	True or if you're born February 29th you get to stay young for a very long time
304000	306000	Even though you look really old for your age
306000	307000	Yes
307000	308000	Alright anyhow
308000	311000	Let's start I guess with a little bit of How's Your Gaming Week
311000	312000	Oh I should say about the marathon
312000	313000	I want to thank the listeners first off
313000	314000	The marathon was awesome
314000	317000	And if you haven't heard it all it's all up on the feed now
317000	319000	We went for 10 and a half hours live
319000	324000	But when you take out the music it was about 9 hours 30-40 minutes worth of podcast
324000	325000	In good times
325000	328000	And we didn't end up playing any games live on air like we thought we were going to
328000	331000	So just really good times
331000	332000	We did match games
332000	333000	No no no I meant video games
333000	334000	Oh
334000	336000	On air not the OLR games
336000	338000	But yeah I mean and big thanks to Alan and Bradley too
338000	339000	Dan sure did
339000	340000	Without their help
340000	341000	Dan
341000	342000	He played the game that shall not be named
342000	343000	For a very long time
343000	344000	Yet
344000	347000	Yes he was playing the Reach Around game for some time
347000	348000	He and his friend
348000	349000	That's what they finished
349000	351000	Yes he and Alex were playing Reach Around
351000	352000	For a while
352000	353000	Has he finished the game yet
353000	358000	I have no idea Dan left for Washington State to go spend like 8 days with his family and
358000	360000	Leave me here by my you
360000	364000	Oh whatever you're going to run around the house naked and play Star Trek online
364000	365000	That's what I do anyway
365000	369000	Well not during the show thankfully
369000	371000	I was playing it when you came in the house
371000	372000	With her clothes on thankfully
372000	373000	Yes
373000	375000	I'm wearing my stylish X-Men t-shirt
375000	377000	But it's why she probably had the door locked
377000	379000	So when I banged on the door she was like oh shit where's my bra
379000	380000	Alright anyway
380000	383000	Oh bored fat fat fat
383000	385000	Alright uh ew
385000	388000	How was your gaming week Dark Soccer besides naked Star Trek
388000	389000	I wasn't naked
389000	392000	I was playing Star Trek online when Rob came in
392000	395000	And I actually stopped in the middle of the part that I was on
395000	397000	Because when I start the game I'll just start right back from where I am
397000	400000	Which is a very good thing about Star Trek online
400000	402000	Unless you're like right at the beginning of it
402000	404000	And you're almost done with the first part and then you die
404000	406000	Anyway um
406000	408000	I played Peggle
408000	410000	You know I haven't touched Epic Citadel since I downloaded it
410000	412000	Except to upgrade it
412000	416000	And I really haven't done much else in the way of gaming
416000	419000	Well Dan got uh
419000	421000	Not
421000	423000	Dead Rising 2
423000	425000	I always want to say Left 4 Dead but
425000	427000	It's Dead Rising 2 the Mission Zero
427000	429000	K-Zero
429000	431000	And he's gotten all of the endings except
431000	434000	Man the bad ending where the little girl turns into a zombie
434000	436000	OMG spoilers
436000	438000	Don't care
438000	441000	If you haven't downloaded it yet and if you haven't got there by now
441000	443000	Then I don't want to hear it
443000	445000	Plus it's kind of obvious
445000	447000	It doesn't even show her turning into a zombie
447000	449000	Well I mean she's a child
449000	451000	I don't care I wanted to see a zombie five year old
451000	453000	I'm sorry you were disappointed
453000	455000	I mean it's like when you watch zombie movies
455000	457000	Okay okay
457000	459000	When you watch zombie movies right
459000	461000	Shouldn't there be like zombie dogs and children
461000	463000	And zombie old people
463000	465000	And
465000	467000	You know and like zombies in wheelchairs
467000	469000	Well actually there wasn't Shaun of the Dead
469000	471000	I suppose it depends on how graphic you want to get
473000	475000	Like and all the people in hospitals turning into zombies and stuff
475000	477000	It's
477000	479000	It just doesn't make sense to me
479000	481000	But yeah
481000	483000	I also have that problem with zombie video games
483000	485000	It was pretty cool though
485000	487000	Especially my favorite weapon that you can make in that game
487000	489000	Is you can get a pitchfork
489000	491000	And attach it to a rifle
491000	493000	And then you can stab them with a pitchfork
493000	495000	Pull them up in the air and shoot them with a shotgun
495000	497000	And they'll explode
497000	499000	That's awesome
499000	501000	And you can also go to this place and get a broadsword
501000	503000	And slice zombies down the middle
503000	505000	And like you can make like the nail bat and everything
505000	507000	But man the pitchfork bayonet
507000	509000	That's innovation
509000	511000	I haven't figured out any weapon combinations
511000	513000	Outside of the nails and bat
513000	515000	Only because I was specifically shown that at E3
515000	517000	How to do that
517000	519000	Pitchfork, rifle
519000	521000	Well you try to figure stuff out
521000	523000	And then also you get cards
523000	525000	And you can take all that stuff into the main game later on
525000	527000	And it even has a dude throwing up
527000	529000	Hooray
529000	531000	Yes
531000	533000	And then you can tape him to a cat
533000	535000	And he becomes a weapon right
535000	537000	But I do love that idea
537000	539000	It certainly seems one step past
539000	541000	The Fable 2 pub games
541000	543000	Which was a neat little innovation in itself
543000	545000	But this is kind of like taking it to the next level
545000	547000	Where like now a games demo
547000	549000	Is actually a whole different game
549000	551000	And yeah you pay for it
551000	553000	But it's kind of a standalone experience
553000	555000	And you know you get to take what you've earned into the main game
555000	557000	It's kind of neat
557000	559000	And it's got three different endings
559000	561000	It's reverse DLC
561000	563000	It's not download content to expand the game
563000	565000	It's very strange
565000	567000	But I like it
567000	569000	It was really cool
569000	571000	When Dan did one of the bad endings
571000	573000	He had the dude with the mohawk wearing a waitress dress
573000	575000	And I was like
575000	577000	Okay that's pretty funny
577000	579000	Because you see this burly guy walking in
579000	581000	Wearing this dress
581000	583000	And then falling to his knees
583000	585000	I can't wait to see some of the hideous costumes you can put the main character in
585000	587000	Because I'll tell you what
587000	589000	Some of the best parts of the first one
589000	591000	Were some of the really skanky costumes
591000	593000	And the random and children's clothing
593000	595000	And the Mega Man outfit
595000	597000	This one's set in Las Vegas isn't it?
597000	599000	Yes
599000	601000	So we need to have the whole showgirls
601000	603000	You know big fantail
603000	605000	And we have to go find Tiara Zombie
605000	607000	Because she lives in Vegas
607000	609000	And undoubtedly be a zombie in the game
609000	611000	We won't aim for the head on the Tiara Zombie
611000	613000	I'll refrain from using the pitchfork bayonetta
613000	615000	On Tiara
615000	617000	What I'll do I'll put a cardboard box on her head
617000	619000	And just watch her run around
619000	621000	In the garden playing PS2 games
621000	623000	Like in Shaun of the Dead
623000	625000	I can't wait to see what kind of comment we get from her
625000	627000	Because she's on AOL during the show right?
627000	629000	Yeah I don't know I have to ask her if she's listening
629000	631000	Let's see going to our chatroom
631000	633000	At chat.orangelaunchradio.com
633000	635000	Let's see a hitstun suggests a cat gun
635000	637000	To which actdeft is saying laser cat gun
637000	639000	That would be a great weapon
639000	641000	I could see using a laser cat
641000	643000	That would be amazing
643000	645000	Loki how was your gaming week?
645000	647000	Pretty eventful actually
647000	649000	Because we did our game summit thing
649000	651000	At our work where we invite publishers
651000	653000	And some of our customers out
653000	655000	And we did it this year kind of
655000	657000	Expo style I guess
657000	659000	Each publisher had a different booth
659000	661000	For the ones that showed up
661000	663000	Not that many bright games though
663000	665000	Even though I offered them like
665000	667000	Hey if you need to borrow a 360 or something
667000	669000	I can help you out with that
669000	671000	So I only played really
671000	673000	Like a few different things
673000	675000	The first one
675000	677000	And there is a video out there
677000	679000	Of it somewhere I don't want to know
679000	681000	Where though
681000	683000	The first game I played this week was
683000	685000	Just Dance 2
685000	687000	And only because
687000	689000	The Ubisoft rep wanted
689000	691000	To demonstrate it and no one would play it
691000	693000	So I was like okay fine
693000	695000	I'll do this and be a good sport about it
695000	697000	So I did that
697000	699000	And she kicked my ass in every single song
699000	701000	Even though she says she didn't play it before
701000	703000	I don't believe her
703000	705000	It was actually kind of fun
705000	707000	It's kind of neat because the game itself
709000	711000	If you haven't played it yet
711000	713000	It's going to be very similar to what Dance Central
713000	715000	I guess is going to be
715000	717000	It pretty much just plays like that
717000	719000	And all you do is you hold the remote
719000	721000	And you just kind of mimic what's on the screen
721000	723000	And it will just kind of
723000	725000	It'll only detect what you're doing with the remote
725000	727000	But it's still pretty close
727000	729000	And it's fun
729000	731000	And it's got some decent songs in there
731000	735000	Did you jam to TikTok?
735000	737000	Did you get your Kesha on?
737000	739000	Yes we did actually
739000	741000	Why?
741000	743000	Why is this not on YouTube?
743000	745000	Why is there not video of Loki playing Just Dance 2?
745000	747000	I am so upset
747000	749000	We mean why is this on YouTube?
749000	751000	It is on YouTube
751000	753000	Oh my god where?
753000	755000	I don't know
755000	757000	There is video of you on YouTube playing Just Dance 2
757000	759000	I don't see it
759000	761000	Tiger Claw
761000	765000	He's the best web scavenger I know
765000	767000	Tiger Claw needs to find this somehow
767000	769000	Use your Google Fu Ninja abilities
769000	771000	I don't know if my boss has uploaded it yet
771000	773000	Because they were taking video
777000	779000	Oh man as soon as this is up you've got to tell me
779000	781000	Yeah I do I guess
781000	783000	Anyways
783000	785000	Try not to sound too excited
785000	787000	Yeah
787000	789000	I'm going to see if I can find
789000	793000	I'm sorry you can find it later
793000	795000	I don't want to cause too much dead air while you search
795000	797000	Yeah no problem
797000	799000	Anyways
799000	801000	So other than Just Dance 2 I got to play around with some of the move demo stuff
801000	807000	I played actually the full version of Sports Champions
807000	809000	Which is kind of fun
809000	811000	I kind of like the archery that's in the game
811000	813000	And that was pretty cool
813000	815000	It sucks though because at the time though
815000	817000	They had this kit that they had
817000	819000	Or it was actually one of the retail
819000	821000	Not 4
821000	823000	250GB systems that they're going to be selling
823000	825000	With Sports Champions bundled in there and stuff
825000	827000	So they have
827000	829000	You can play a lot of these games
829000	831000	Like the archery stuff
831000	833000	Either with two of the move controllers
833000	835000	Or one controller
835000	837000	So the one controller has it
837000	839000	You take the move and you kind of
839000	841000	Put it over your shoulder like you're pulling an arrow out of a quiver
841000	843000	And then you kind of point it at the screen
843000	845000	That way
845000	847000	And it actually worked really well
847000	849000	And then I also played some of the frisbee golf
849000	851000	Which was kind of fun
851000	853000	But I'm horrible at frisbee golf
853000	855000	I tried a little bit of the table tennis
855000	857000	I don't care for the table tennis too much
857000	859000	But
859000	861000	How did archery in the PlayStation Move sports game
861000	863000	Compare to archery in Wii sport resort
863000	865000	Or whatever
865000	867000	I haven't played Wii sports resort yet
867000	869000	But I think it would be way more accurate
869000	871000	Than it is
871000	873000	It's just
873000	875000	I don't know, it just felt right
875000	877000	I guess
877000	879000	I haven't played it with two of the
879000	881000	Two of the controllers yet
881000	883000	I do have my own kit now
883000	885000	I have two of the move controllers
885000	887000	Which Rob was
887000	889000	Sticking on his chest earlier
889000	891000	And I'm sure there's pictures online
891000	893000	I would not say that those pictures exist on Twitter
893000	895000	He wouldn't say that
895000	897000	No
897000	899000	So I got to play that
899000	901000	Well it makes sense to me
901000	903000	Sony decided to release
903000	905000	Some of the move required games
905000	907000	On the 7th
907000	909000	Of September
909000	911000	And while that may be the case
911000	913000	You're not going to find them in stores
913000	915000	Because
915000	917000	Like most smart stores
917000	919000	They're not going to overnight some product
919000	921000	To their stores
921000	923000	So that it can't be played for a week
923000	925000	Thus frustrating people
925000	927000	So actually
927000	929000	I got to play this by today
929000	931000	And no one had any of the stuff that's already out
931000	933000	For the move
933000	935000	Which is disappointing because I have just the demos to play right now
935000	937000	Which is fine, they're still fun
937000	939000	Another demo I checked out was
939000	941000	Ipet
941000	943000	And I got to say Ipet is retarded
943000	945000	And it really does not work
945000	947000	It seems like a neat idea at first
947000	949000	But you mean
949000	951000	To actually get it so that it looks right
951000	953000	You have to get the camera at
953000	955000	The perfect angle
955000	957000	For a crappy
957000	959000	Itoy game
959000	961000	Way back in the Playstation 2
961000	963000	And stuff
963000	965000	It's not good at all
965000	967000	It doesn't lend well to the argument that
967000	969000	This is just the itoy all over again
969000	971000	It does not
971000	973000	Thankfully that's the only game that's the case
973000	975000	With
975000	977000	They have you
977000	979000	Do a few different things
979000	981000	For example they have you
981000	983000	Play with
983000	985000	Him I guess you move your fingers
985000	987000	And he's supposed to roll over
987000	989000	And stuff
989000	991000	And it just did not detect that
991000	993000	It was just having trouble figuring out what I was trying to do
993000	995000	And then it had me
995000	997000	Draw an airplane
997000	999000	And he'd fly around in it
999000	1001000	And I don't know what the
1001000	1003000	Problem was with this but for some reason
1003000	1005000	I'm pretty good at tracing
1005000	1007000	Outlines and stuff
1007000	1009000	Like on the Wii and the DS
1009000	1011000	And that kind of thing
1011000	1013000	When you see outline for the plane
1013000	1015000	Using the Playstation move controller
1015000	1017000	It looked like crap
1017000	1019000	It just was not working too well
1019000	1021000	But you know hey whatever
1021000	1023000	It's a crappy game to begin with
1023000	1025000	And then also they have you trying to wash him
1025000	1027000	And the problem is I couldn't tell
1027000	1029000	Like I had trouble figuring out
1029000	1031000	You know whether my move controller
1031000	1033000	Was in front or behind him
1033000	1035000	And stuff like that so I had to kind of try to figure out
1035000	1037000	Where to turn it in perspective
1037000	1039000	It's just very awkward
1039000	1041000	But I mean most people will figure out
1041000	1043000	That it's a waste of time anyways
1043000	1045000	Then what else did I try
1045000	1047000	I tried the Tiger Woods demo
1047000	1049000	And that worked alright
1049000	1051000	It's just very difficult to get it set up
1051000	1053000	So that
1053000	1055000	It you know
1055000	1057000	So you can use the move controller
1057000	1059000	At least I found that it was kind of difficult to get it set up
1059000	1061000	Oh and calibrating it's actually pretty easy
1061000	1063000	As far as
1063000	1065000	Because I was reading some reviews
1065000	1067000	You know for different things
1067000	1069000	They had to constantly calibrate the controller
1069000	1071000	I didn't find that to be the case actually
1071000	1073000	With sports champions you calibrate it once
1073000	1075000	And you're good to go
1075000	1077000	So that was kind of cool
1077000	1079000	And I'm trying to think of what else I played
1079000	1081000	That was kind of fun
1081000	1083000	I tried the
1083000	1085000	It's like that
1085000	1087000	Some kung fu game
1087000	1089000	Where you actually
1089000	1091000	Roll down the street on like office chairs
1091000	1093000	And that was crap
1093000	1095000	It did not control well
1095000	1097000	Sports champions is fun
1097000	1099000	Wasn't there a mini game in
1099000	1101000	Incredible Crisis where you go down the street
1101000	1103000	In a chair no it's on a
1103000	1105000	Gurney
1105000	1107000	Yes it's on the hospital bed yeah
1107000	1109000	Looking at our chat room chat
1109000	1111000	BlackWolf is in our chat
1111000	1113000	The good pal of ours that does the show before us
1113000	1115000	Live at All Games Radio
1115000	1117000	When we tape live on Sunday nights
1117000	1119000	He says oh cool I didn't realize that move was coming out on Friday
1119000	1121000	And not Sunday originally it was coming out on Sunday
1121000	1123000	Yeah they kept moving it around
1123000	1125000	In fact the Sony reps had trouble remembering
1125000	1127000	What day it was supposed to be coming out on
1127000	1129000	But yeah it's Friday now not Sunday
1129000	1131000	Although there are some games coming out on Sunday
1131000	1133000	But you don't really need to mess with those
1133000	1135000	It's just the Brunswick bowling game
1135000	1137000	So would you be paying money for this?
1137000	1139000	Would I be paying money for it?
1139000	1141000	If you didn't already have it in your hot little hands
1141000	1143000	Would you pay money for it?
1143000	1145000	I might but the problem is I don't know how much
1145000	1147000	I'm going to play with this
1147000	1149000	But it's pretty fun
1149000	1151000	It's definitely
1151000	1153000	If you like the Wii stuff you're going to probably like this
1153000	1155000	But it is a lot more sensitive
1155000	1157000	I think so they kind of took
1157000	1159000	What they did on the Wii and improved
1159000	1161000	Upon it which is good so
1161000	1163000	As long as they come out with
1163000	1165000	Good games for it then I don't think it's
1165000	1167000	A bad investment at all
1167000	1169000	And the best part about it
1169000	1171000	This is like a lot of the stuff
1171000	1173000	You probably don't need to get the navigation controller
1173000	1175000	For because most of the games don't use it
1175000	1177000	Oh wow
1177000	1179000	Really you're only going to use the navigation controller
1179000	1181000	You're going to be playing like SoCom or Killzone 3
1181000	1183000	I think
1183000	1185000	I got to admit I'm not sure it's the greatest idea
1185000	1187000	That they do this whole
1187000	1189000	Separate skews
1189000	1191000	For like a camera
1191000	1193000	A camera and
1193000	1195000	One controller, a controller
1195000	1197000	And the navigation
1197000	1199000	It kind of seems like it's too complicated to figure out
1199000	1201000	What you need and with all these different
1201000	1203000	Peripherals out there
1203000	1205000	It's tough for the designer
1205000	1207000	I like that they did that though because I own a camera
1207000	1209000	Now that I've got the kit
1209000	1211000	I've got two cameras for no reason
1211000	1213000	But the whole optional navigation controller
1213000	1215000	Which I guess is true on the Wii to an extent
1215000	1217000	But every Wii comes with one at least
1217000	1219000	So the designers know they can do at least one
1219000	1221000	Well technically it still comes with one
1221000	1223000	Because it comes with a regular DualShock controller
1223000	1225000	Which can double as the navigation controller
1225000	1227000	If you want it to
1227000	1229000	So if you really
1229000	1231000	It's kind of awkward to hold it
1231000	1233000	Because you have to hold it with one hand
1233000	1235000	But I mean
1235000	1237000	If you really care then you can use that
1237000	1239000	As a navigation controller
1239000	1241000	If for example
1241000	1243000	Like you're playing Killzone 3
1243000	1245000	Or something like that and you want to try out the move
1245000	1247000	Controls and you have a move controller
1247000	1249000	But you don't have the navigation controller
1249000	1251000	You can get by with that
1251000	1253000	But you may want to get an actual navigation controller
1253000	1255000	Later on
1255000	1257000	Looking at our chat room live on this Sunday night
1257000	1259000	At chat.orangeloungeradio.com
1259000	1261000	Tigerclaw is saying, speaking of move
1261000	1263000	Sony launched an anti-connect site about the buttons
1263000	1265000	YayButtons.com
1265000	1267000	I'd heard about this but I didn't
1267000	1269000	It wasn't on our list for tonight
1269000	1271000	Have you looked at this site at all?
1271000	1273000	Yeah I mean that's great that they have a campaign
1273000	1275000	About yay buttons and stuff like that
1275000	1277000	I do love that website name
1277000	1279000	I gotta say
1279000	1281000	Yay Buttons is a good name for a site
1281000	1283000	That's a stupid argument to make right now
1283000	1285000	Because
1285000	1287000	Even Microsoft came out and said
1287000	1289000	Well we never said that we can't have a game
1289000	1291000	That uses both the connect camera
1291000	1293000	And the controller
1293000	1295000	So you know
1295000	1297000	Hooray with your campaign and everything
1297000	1299000	And really all these games
1299000	1301000	That they have out there right now
1301000	1303000	Just use either the trigger
1303000	1305000	Or the top move button
1305000	1307000	Or basically the A and B button
1307000	1309000	On a Wii remote
1309000	1311000	Because a lot of these games play just like Wii games
1311000	1313000	I mean it's
1313000	1315000	What a shock
1315000	1317000	I know, what a shock that they play like Wii games
1317000	1319000	I don't know
1319000	1321000	It's kind of fun
1321000	1323000	I mean if you
1323000	1325000	If you're looking for something that's gonna be
1325000	1327000	Way better than the Wii
1327000	1329000	You're probably not gonna find it with this
1329000	1331000	Alright so what games
1331000	1333000	Do we have to look forward to on the move
1333000	1335000	That you're gonna be checking out for us?
1335000	1337000	Well the
1337000	1339000	You know
1339000	1341000	Sports Champions
1341000	1343000	That's pretty good
1343000	1345000	I actually haven't played it yet
1345000	1347000	But there's that
1347000	1349000	Time Crisis Raising Storm
1349000	1351000	That looked kind of fun
1351000	1353000	I like the Toy Story 3 game but
1353000	1355000	If it's too much money I wouldn't bother
1355000	1357000	It was cute though
1357000	1359000	It reminded me of Midway Mania
1359000	1361000	I might check out
1361000	1363000	I'm trying to think what else
1363000	1365000	I would probably pick up for that
1365000	1367000	I don't know
1367000	1369000	It's hard to say right now
1369000	1371000	I'm not gonna pick up
1371000	1373000	SOCOM
1373000	1375000	Maybe some of the PlayStation Network games
1375000	1377000	I'll just see whatever they throw my way
1377000	1379000	Cause I don't want to spend a lot of money
1379000	1381000	Alright
1381000	1383000	Well let's talk about My Gaming Week
1383000	1385000	Actually before we get to My Gaming Week though
1385000	1387000	I want to make a special phone call here a little bit
1387000	1389000	I'm gonna actually call
1389000	1391000	He was here last week on the show
1391000	1393000	He's Alan AKA Salacious Pop
1393000	1395000	AKA my boyfriend
1395000	1397000	Is sitting there at his computer
1397000	1399000	And he knows we're calling him cause I want to talk about something here tonight
1399000	1401000	Hey Alan are you there?
1401000	1403000	Yep
1403000	1405000	So Alan
1405000	1407000	You live in the Bay Area
1407000	1409000	In California right?
1409000	1411000	Yes
1411000	1413000	And you don't live that far away from where there was actually
1413000	1415000	A really bad tragedy this week right?
1415000	1417000	Yep
1417000	1419000	Tell us a little bit about what happened
1419000	1421000	Thursday evening at about 615
1421000	1423000	A giant gas main
1423000	1425000	Several feet across
1425000	1427000	Blew up underneath some houses
1427000	1429000	And kind of destroyed an entire neighborhood
1429000	1431000	Very sad
1431000	1433000	And a lot of trouble
1433000	1435000	When they sort through all that mess
1435000	1437000	But very very sad tragedy
1437000	1439000	So I mean was it scary?
1439000	1441000	Did you have to evacuate?
1441000	1443000	Did you have to get out of the house?
1443000	1445000	What happened?
1445000	1447000	Well it happened
1447000	1449000	The neighborhood affected is maybe two miles away from me
1449000	1451000	Which is very close
1451000	1453000	But when it comes to horrible things happening
1453000	1455000	Is actually a safe amount of distance
1455000	1457000	I actually did not know
1457000	1459000	What was going on
1459000	1461000	Until about 30 minutes later
1461000	1463000	When my roommate knocked on the door and said
1463000	1465000	Hey do you know what's going on outside the window right now?
1465000	1469000	But I may as well have been in another city
1469000	1471000	This block that I'm on was totally unaffected
1471000	1473000	All of the wind blew all the smoke
1473000	1475000	And everything south
1475000	1477000	Well I'm happy to hear you're okay
1477000	1479000	And that you're out of it fine
1479000	1481000	But I remember last year it was around Christmas
1481000	1483000	Or whatever
1483000	1485000	A very similar thing happened where I was living at the time
1485000	1487000	In a suburb called Rancho Cordova
1487000	1489000	And a house literally blew up
1489000	1491000	Because of a gas leak
1491000	1493000	And I remember distinctly
1493000	1495000	Even though I was about a mile away
1495000	1497000	I heard this giant boom noise
1497000	1499000	And things actually shook for a minute
1499000	1501000	And my car had ash on it
1501000	1503000	It was crazy
1503000	1505000	It was really sad
1505000	1507000	But you didn't hear a giant boom
1507000	1509000	You didn't feel the shake
1509000	1511000	Or was it just oh another earthquake
1511000	1513000	I don't get it. What happened?
1513000	1515000	So only being two miles away
1515000	1517000	And it being as large as it was
1517000	1519000	It did actually shake the building that I'm in
1519000	1521000	Apparently it rattled windows for miles
1521000	1523000	In every direction
1523000	1525000	I was completely oblivious though
1525000	1527000	Because at the time I was raiding
1527000	1529000	In WOW
1529000	1531000	Which is really the punchline
1531000	1533000	That you were trying desperately to get me to
1533000	1535000	So yes, I was raiding in WOW
1535000	1537000	While 53 homes were completely razzed
1537000	1539000	And my housemate had to tell me
1539000	1541000	To look out the window
1541000	1543000	To see what was going on
1543000	1545000	And he had to tell me to look out the window
1545000	1547000	To see all the black smoke
1547000	1549000	Yes, there's the punchline I was looking for
1549000	1551000	And why I brought you on to tell this horrible
1551000	1553000	Tragedy story on the video game radio show
1553000	1555000	Is that you missed
1555000	1557000	Total chaos and tragedy
1557000	1559000	Going on mere miles away
1559000	1561000	Because you were trying to get Fester got down
1561000	1563000	Yeah
1563000	1565000	Everyone's judging me right now
1565000	1567000	Did you get any loot?
1567000	1569000	No
1569000	1571000	I got no good drops
1571000	1573000	But what must have been your reaction though
1573000	1575000	When you opened up the window
1575000	1577000	And just saw all the smoke
1577000	1579000	Were you just like, oh damn
1579000	1581000	Well yeah, I was like
1581000	1583000	That's not good
1583000	1585000	And then I went to KCBS
1585000	1587000	And SF Gate and I started looking at the feeds
1587000	1591000	Because there was a huge boom
1591000	1593000	That set off the gas explosion
1593000	1595000	And people didn't know what it was
1595000	1597000	So they thought that maybe a plane had crashed
1597000	1599000	Into a house and that set off
1599000	1601000	The gas main, which wasn't the case
1601000	1603000	So I was reading all the speculation on
1603000	1605000	If an airplane went down
1605000	1607000	Which there wasn't, just something sparked
1607000	1609000	And set off the crack in the pipe
1609000	1611000	But yeah, so once
1611000	1613000	I realized what was going on
1613000	1615000	I took time to check it out
1615000	1617000	And after the sunset I could see the orange
1617000	1619000	Glow over the hill
1619000	1621000	Because the fire burned for
1621000	1623000	A couple hours because they couldn't turn
1623000	1625000	The gas main off, so it was like a big blowtorch
1625000	1627000	Oh my gosh, so sad
1627000	1629000	Yeah, I can't even imagine
1629000	1631000	Just being at home, watching Oprah
1631000	1633000	Or being like Dark Sakura, sitting around naked
1633000	1635000	Playing Star Trek online
1635000	1637000	And then suddenly, kaboom
1637000	1639000	Oops
1639000	1641000	PG and E didn't notice the crack in the pipe
1641000	1643000	Uh oh, you know what's actually kind of sad
1643000	1645000	Though, you know, and again
1645000	1647000	I seriously don't mean to make light of a tragedy
1647000	1649000	It's just kind of interesting that
1649000	1651000	Sometimes we get so
1651000	1653000	In the zone of gaming that we miss these things
1653000	1655000	But it's kind of funny, I have a similar story
1655000	1657000	It's not really gaming related, but it was a couple years ago
1657000	1659000	Um, 07 maybe
1659000	1661000	I had just moved into the house
1661000	1663000	I was at, where we had the OLR studio before
1663000	1665000	I don't know if I ever brought this up on the show
1665000	1667000	But the house across the street
1667000	1669000	From us burned down, like it caught fire
1669000	1671000	And burned down one night
1671000	1673000	And I totally missed it going on
1673000	1675000	I was at home, and totally didn't even
1675000	1677000	See it happening, you know why?
1677000	1679000	I was asleep, I was taking a nap
1679000	1681000	After work, and my roommate comes home
1681000	1683000	And is like, Rob, Rob, are you here?
1683000	1685000	Rob, Rob, where's Rob?
1685000	1687000	Practically barking, and I'm like, what's going on?
1687000	1689000	He's like, do you not hear the fire trucks
1689000	1691000	Outside right now?
1691000	1693000	Do you not see the news media?
1693000	1695000	And I kind of do that thing where like
1695000	1697000	I'm kind of groggy and I'm peeking out the window
1697000	1699000	And it's just like, oh shit
1699000	1701000	The house burned down across the street
1701000	1703000	I'm pretty sure it was a meth lab
1703000	1705000	But, you know
1705000	1707000	It's a good thing it didn't spread
1707000	1709000	Thank you fire department
1709000	1711000	When I was in grade school
1711000	1713000	I'm living in Martinez
1713000	1715000	Martinez has a huge
1715000	1717000	Ugly shell oil refinery
1717000	1719000	Behind it, for anyone that's ever been in Martinez
1719000	1721000	It looks very
1721000	1723000	Blade runner
1723000	1725000	It's very gross and huge
1725000	1727000	And that had an explosion
1727000	1729000	And I think like
1729000	1731000	Two or three workers unfortunately died
1731000	1733000	At the time, I was like 10 or 11 years old
1733000	1735000	When this happened
1735000	1737000	And again, the refinery is maybe
1737000	1739000	Four or five miles
1739000	1741000	And you can see the smokestacks of it
1741000	1743000	From out our kitchen window
1743000	1745000	And that actually shook the house
1745000	1747000	And I was very much aware of what was happening then
1747000	1749000	So, yeah
1749000	1751000	And I was probably playing my nest at the time
1751000	1753000	So
1753000	1755000	Yeah, I felt that one
1755000	1757000	But this one, two miles away
1757000	1759000	I was like
1759000	1761000	Wrath, wrath, wrath eclipse
1761000	1763000	Starfire, starfire, starfire
1763000	1765000	I didn't, I don't know
1765000	1767000	Alright, well look
1767000	1769000	We do want to make a donation to the victims of
1769000	1771000	San Bruno, which you know, we don't
1771000	1773000	Again, we don't mean to make fun of it
1773000	1775000	We're making fun of Alan and the fact that he missed it
1775000	1777000	And not making fun of what happened
1777000	1779000	Because it really is a tragedy
1779000	1781000	We do definitely want you to consider
1781000	1783000	Maybe making a donation to the Red Cross
1783000	1785000	To help the victims of the San Bruno fire
1785000	1787000	They can be reached at 1-800-RED-CROSS
1787000	1789000	Simply on the phone
1789000	1791000	And if you specify that you want to donate to the San Bruno fire
1791000	1793000	They will pass those donations along
1793000	1795000	You can also visit them on the web
1795000	1797000	There's also a specific website
1797000	1799000	www.redcrossbayarea.org
1799000	1801000	But Alan would appreciate it
1801000	1803000	If you sent him all your leet purples
1803000	1805000	And wow gold, correct?
1805000	1807000	And for those OLR listeners
1807000	1809000	Living in the Bay Area that have donated blood
1809000	1811000	That don't have ridiculous restrictions
1811000	1813000	Against them, that prevents them from donating blood
1813000	1815000	Which, archaic, archaic things
1815000	1817000	That need to be changed
1817000	1819000	But, you know
1819000	1821000	Unfortunately, we don't want to hold
1821000	1823000	Those silly restrictions against the victims
1823000	1825000	So we'll donate cash I guess
1825000	1827000	But definitely
1827000	1829000	Well thanks for calling
1829000	1831000	Hey, no problem, thanks for being on the show
1831000	1833000	Thank you for letting me make fun of you
1833000	1835000	See, this is why you rock
1835000	1837000	Thank you Alan
1837000	1839000	For letting me make fun of you a little bit on the show
1839000	1841000	I actually don't have a whole lot to add to that
1841000	1843000	My gaming week was kind of uninteresting outside of wow myself
1843000	1845000	If my neighborhood had exploded
1845000	1847000	I would have probably not noticed it either
1847000	1849000	Because I would have been doing the same thing
1849000	1851000	I did check out one new game though
1851000	1853000	The iPhone now has the Game Center
1853000	1855000	Right, just launched this week
1855000	1857000	Now Game Center is available on the iPhone
1857000	1859000	What a pointless thing
1859000	1861000	It doesn't do anything
1861000	1863000	And these are like two half-assed things
1863000	1865000	That Apple has launched lately between PING
1865000	1867000	Which is like, I think it's like Twitter
1867000	1869000	But it's not
1869000	1871000	Because all it really shows is the music
1871000	1873000	Game Room, you just have a friends list
1873000	1875000	And you can see what games they own
1875000	1877000	And what achievements they have
1877000	1879000	But I have yet to see how that whole
1879000	1881000	multiplayer integration works
1881000	1883000	Or anything like that
1883000	1885000	I don't get it
1885000	1887000	I haven't tried any of those
1887000	1889000	But because I'm a sucker and because I had credit
1889000	1891000	Still from gift cards I got for my birthday a few months ago
1891000	1893000	I downloaded one of the Game Center compatible games
1893000	1895000	It's a game called
1895000	1897000	Graal Classic Plus
1897000	1899000	And I was drawn to check out this game
1899000	1901000	Because the artwork kind of makes it look like
1901000	1903000	This little Legend of Zelda-y
1903000	1905000	Chibi type of game
1905000	1907000	And it said it was an MMO
1907000	1909000	I have a neat idea, like an MMO on the iPhone
1909000	1911000	That kind of looks like a Super Nintendo game, right?
1911000	1913000	Awesome? Oh my god
1913000	1915000	It's the worst thing I've ever played in my life
1915000	1917000	It is so stupid
1917000	1919000	Did you spend money on that?
1919000	1921000	Well, I spent someone else's money
1921000	1923000	Because it was gift cards
1923000	1925000	I spent $1.99 on that
1925000	1927000	And it is so stupid
1927000	1929000	It's one of those
1929000	1931000	It's the equivalent of one of those MMOs
1931000	1933000	That you would see the cards for at the grocery store
1933000	1935000	That you just kind of laugh out
1935000	1937000	By those, right?
1937000	1939000	It's worse than Farmville
1939000	1941000	Farmville's pretty awful
1941000	1943000	I don't understand
1943000	1945000	There's no quests
1945000	1947000	There's no leveling
1947000	1949000	It's just make a character and run around
1949000	1951000	Stabbing bushes, hoping you find
1951000	1953000	Little green gems in them
1953000	1955000	I think there's guilds
1955000	1957000	But the chat is all screwed up
1957000	1959000	It's just overcome with idiocy
1959000	1961000	And just people
1961000	1963000	Yelling weird things
1963000	1965000	On the road and trying to trick people
1965000	1967000	Into giving honor points
1967000	1969000	I don't get it
1969000	1971000	Why would anyone waste their time with this garbage
1971000	1973000	Well, I did, I guess
1973000	1975000	Boy, did I pick a stinker to test out Game Center with
1975000	1977000	So now I've decided Game Center is completely stupid
1977000	1979000	And a waste of time
1979000	1981000	Based on this one game that I played
1981000	1983000	So, yeah
1983000	1985000	That would be the one new game
1985000	1987000	That I checked out this week
1987000	1989000	Again, that's Brawl Classic Plus
1989000	1991000	Look, if you want to burn $2
1991000	1993000	It's one of those, I'm almost thinking it's so bad
1993000	1995000	You have to see it
1995000	1997000	If anybody can figure out the point of this game
1997000	1999000	I would love to hear from you
1999000	2001000	I would love to hear from the developers of this game
2001000	2003000	Of what it is they were trying to do with this game
2003000	2005000	Because I don't get it
2005000	2007000	Pull you into paying for it
2007000	2009000	Help
2009000	2011000	So there you go
2011000	2013000	Game Center, fail
2013000	2015000	Ping, fail
2015000	2017000	Brawl, whatever, plus plus, mega fail
2017000	2019000	Otherwise, it's just been more Warcraft
2019000	2021000	Oh, I did play Dead Rising
2021000	2023000	Case Zero myself
2023000	2025000	And it was fun
2025000	2027000	But I got eaten by a lot of zombies
2027000	2029000	Because I'm not very good at Dead Rising
2029000	2031000	Did the military kill you?
2031000	2033000	Did you find all the bike parts easily?
2033000	2035000	No, I was trying to get to the van with the Zombrex
2035000	2037000	And I got chewed up, I didn't get very far at all
2037000	2039000	But I liked that there were so many cut scenes
2039000	2041000	And everything in an arcade game
2041000	2043000	I thought that was kind of cool
2043000	2045000	That was pretty neat, I thought it was fun
2045000	2047000	Pitchfork, rifle, win
2047000	2049000	Alright
2049000	2051000	Let's see, going to
2051000	2053000	You know what, it just occurred to me what a cool weapon would be
2053000	2055000	Take like three broadswords and a pogo stick
2055000	2057000	And you'd have pogo stab
2057000	2059000	That would be awesome
2059000	2061000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangesolentrader.com
2061000	2063000	Marissa Congusto, we love Marissa
2063000	2065000	I love her
2065000	2067000	Marissa, I love you
2067000	2069000	Alright, I'm going to poop on ping
2069000	2071000	She's pooping, get it?
2071000	2073000	She's going to poop on ping
2073000	2075000	Pooping
2075000	2077000	Because it censors tweets from artists
2077000	2079000	Such as Gaga's pro gay marriage tweets
2079000	2081000	Eye roll, it's useless
2081000	2083000	I didn't even know they did that
2083000	2085000	That would be a great name for a website though
2085000	2087000	Pooping
2087000	2089000	That's great
2089000	2091000	Somebody needs to register that
2091000	2093000	Oh yeah, it's like a copy of Twitter
2093000	2099000	Can somebody please explain to me the point of ping and game center
2099000	2103000	And the sad thing is they both sounded really good
2103000	2105000	Just like ping pals? Did that sound good too?
2105000	2109000	I'm thinking the word ping is just death for your service
2109000	2111000	I remember when ping
2111000	2113000	Coming next week, Orange Ping Radio
2113000	2117000	Was just, you know, on the other IRC screen where it just went ping, ping, ping
2117000	2121000	There was also an app for the iPhone for a limited time called ping
2121000	2123000	And it was like free SMS basically, to put it lightly
2123000	2125000	They changed their name a few months ago to ping chat
2125000	2127000	And they never said why, now I know
2127000	2129000	Because Apple probably said
2129000	2131000	You better change your name or we're going to pooping on you
2131000	2133000	So there you go
2133000	2137000	Maybe we can release an app called pooping
2137000	2143000	You know what, we should get someone who can program like that and do an app to make fun of it called pooping
2143000	2145000	Or cropping
2145000	2147000	It probably would not get approved by the app store
2147000	2149000	Maybe you could put it on Android
2149000	2151000	Like a social network called pooping
2151000	2153000	And it could be all about
2153000	2155000	Like, you know, because that's what Twitter is for
2155000	2157000	It's all for talking shit about people
2157000	2159000	Well no, you know how you make tweets when you go to the bathroom
2159000	2161000	I'm pooping right now
2161000	2165000	Or actually, well I noticed that the lovely Jessica Harper is in our chat right now
2165000	2167000	She's from Under Station Live
2167000	2169000	Which is live here at All Games this Saturday night
2169000	2173000	And I know she uses Foursquare to check in from her toilet
2173000	2176000	Because she actually has a location called sitting on the toilet
2176000	2179000	So I could see that being a use of like, pooping
2179000	2182000	Would be like, you know, sitting on the toilet
2182000	2185000	Or it could be like, it could be reviews of stalls around the nation
2185000	2187000	I ate lots of fiber today
2187000	2189000	This is really painful
2189000	2191000	Like, you know, Burger King bathroom, well cleaned
2191000	2193000	Smells like bleach
2197000	2201000	Anyhow, chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to join
2201000	2203000	And join in the madness
2203000	2207000	Marissa said that Steve Jobs said himself no more fart apps
2207000	2209000	Really?
2209000	2211000	That's a good thing, I think
2211000	2213000	We don't need any more fart apps
2213000	2217000	Alright, LightAmiga777 in chat says, OLR poop
2217000	2219000	Where there's smoke, they ping back
2219000	2221000	I think I get that
2221000	2224000	Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into some gaming news tonight
2224000	2226000	Oh, quick housekeeping
2226000	2229000	Add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio
2229000	2232000	We also have a Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR
2232000	2234000	And you should add us on those sites
2234000	2236000	And yeah, otherwise
2236000	2239000	I don't think there's a whole lot of news going on here
2239000	2241000	I'm gonna be out the first week of October
2241000	2243000	October 2nd, 3rd, somewhere in there
2243000	2245000	I'm gonna be gone that week
2245000	2246000	So I don't know if there'll be a show
2246000	2247000	Bring me pins
2247000	2248000	There can be
2248000	2250000	But I'm going to Gay Days at Disneyland
2250000	2251000	Bring me pins
2251000	2252000	Lots of them
2252000	2254000	I'm taking Alan for the first time since he was 18
2254000	2255000	I know
2255000	2257000	Don't worry, we're going back for Tron, remember?
2257000	2259000	December 17th is a big day
2259000	2260000	Yes, we are, but you still must bring me pins
2260000	2261000	I will
2261000	2262000	Maybe they'll have a Tron pin
2262000	2264000	If you find Tron pins, you better
2264000	2265000	I will
2265000	2267000	I will give you monies
2267000	2269000	For pins, for Tron
2269000	2272000	Alright, let's get into some actual bonafide gaming news
2272000	2274000	We're only like 40 minutes in this show
2274000	2276000	And haven't talked a lot about gaming news
2276000	2278000	Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?
2278000	2280000	Well, lots of stuff
2280000	2283000	Especially when it comes to PS3 and firmware
2283000	2285000	And all that fun stuff
2285000	2287000	Well, starting things off
2287000	2289000	You knew what was gonna happen
2289000	2291000	The Playstation 3 got a mandatory firmware
2291000	2293000	Bringing it up to 3.42
2293000	2295000	This firmware update does nothing
2295000	2297000	Other than break the PS
2297000	2299000	Jailbreak and the PS Groove hacks
2299000	2301000	And since this was
2301000	2303000	An overall security
2303000	2305000	Related issue
2305000	2307000	It says we will provide no further
2307000	2309000	Commentary to this case
2309000	2311000	Well, that's a
2311000	2313000	Wonderful thing to say
2313000	2315000	Fucking dick of a Sony rep
2315000	2317000	Well, to be fair
2317000	2319000	Well, why didn't they just say
2319000	2321000	We're not providing commentary
2321000	2323000	In this case, nah
2323000	2325000	They could just say, we don't like people hacking our consoles
2325000	2327000	Devil's advocate
2327000	2329000	A, they don't owe you shit for an explanation
2329000	2331000	B, maybe they plan to litigate against these people
2331000	2333000	So they don't want to say anything publicly
2333000	2335000	Because there's gonna be litigation in the future
2335000	2337000	I don't know if they can, because
2337000	2339000	I don't know, because the
2339000	2341000	Oh, come on, this is America, they can sue anyone
2341000	2343000	They can try, I guess
2345000	2347000	Shrine's important for them
2347000	2351000	Yay buttons, I don't know
2351000	2355000	Yaylawsuit.com
2357000	2359000	No new features, though
2359000	2361000	In this latest firmware, right?
2361000	2363000	The only feature is disabling this
2363000	2365000	If you are interested still in running
2365000	2367000	Homebrew stuff, and we will get to why
2367000	2369000	The homebrew is not all bad
2369000	2371000	Remember, it's just that backup device
2371000	2373000	That's the bad thing
2373000	2375000	Homebrew, not so bad
2375000	2377000	Of course, Sony just sees the backup device
2377000	2379000	And that's all they care about
2379000	2381000	So if you don't want to update to 3.41
2381000	2383000	Stay off the PlayStation Network
2383000	2385000	It's interesting, though
2385000	2387000	Because one of the things that actually
2387000	2389000	Did come around because of this
2389000	2391000	Is a way to enable
2391000	2393000	Any PlayStation 3 game
2393000	2395000	To be played as
2395000	2397000	A remote play game
2397000	2399000	On your PSP
2399000	2401000	Why they aren't like that in the first place
2401000	2403000	Is beyond me, but apparently
2403000	2405000	It's a really simple edit to
2405000	2407000	One of the files that's on there
2407000	2409000	That you basically
2409000	2411000	You can actually run this program called
2411000	2413000	A PS3 SFO editor
2413000	2415000	Once you have your game dumped
2415000	2417000	To the hard drive
2417000	2419000	And you just click a button that says
2419000	2421000	PSP Remote Play Available
2421000	2423000	And then click it and it will allow you to play
2423000	2425000	It over your PSP
2425000	2427000	Including games that don't allow it
2427000	2429000	Like, for example, Infamous
2429000	2431000	They actually have video of that
2431000	2433000	That's kind of neat
2433000	2435000	And a feature I don't see why they don't have
2435000	2437000	Maybe because it's buggy
2437000	2439000	In some games, I don't know, but
2439000	2441000	If it can be done
2441000	2443000	I don't know why they don't
2443000	2445000	Well, you kind of answered your own question
2445000	2447000	If it bugs in some games, that's gonna be enough
2447000	2449000	I think
2449000	2451000	It has to work consistently or they're not gonna implement it
2451000	2453000	I would think
2453000	2455000	Well, I don't know about that, but
2455000	2457000	Has it ever stopped developers from
2457000	2459000	Rushing out games?
2459000	2461000	Point taken
2461000	2463000	So, yeah, I don't know
2463000	2465000	And then, let's see
2465000	2467000	Other fun stuff
2467000	2469000	Of course, the PlayStation
2469000	2471000	Freedom
2471000	2473000	It is the port of the
2473000	2475000	PS Groove, I guess
2475000	2477000	It's basically the open source
2477000	2479000	Device or
2479000	2481000	Code that you can throw on
2481000	2483000	A USB stick
2483000	2485000	Well, the PS Freedom
2485000	2487000	Which was the one that's actually being ported
2487000	2489000	To the PSP
2489000	2491000	And everything else
2491000	2493000	Is actually available on quite a few different things
2493000	2495000	Including
2495000	2497000	The iPhone and iPod
2497000	2499000	That is, of course, if you have
2499000	2501000	Your phone or iPod
2501000	2503000	Jailbroken
2503000	2505000	And basically what this does is
2505000	2507000	It runs a modified
2507000	2509000	Program on the
2509000	2511000	Android operating system
2511000	2513000	There's all the different things that do it
2513000	2515000	That way
2515000	2517000	Which is kind of interesting
2517000	2519000	They actually have it ported
2519000	2521000	Funny enough
2521000	2523000	To the TI-84
2523000	2525000	Man, those calculators can do anything
2525000	2527000	Including
2527000	2529000	Wow, they still make those
2529000	2531000	That was the graphing calculator back in my day
2531000	2533000	Yeah
2533000	2535000	Or maybe it was the 82, I don't know, but still
2535000	2537000	Well, they had the 84s back in my day
2537000	2539000	But I think they're a little bit newer now
2539000	2541000	But yeah, they actually
2541000	2543000	You're officially 30 now, you're old
2543000	2545000	I'm sorry to interrupt, I've been told to make a small noise
2545000	2547000	Okay
2547000	2549000	What?
2549000	2551000	You can continue
2551000	2553000	Okay, other devices that the
2553000	2555000	PS Freedom has been ported to
2555000	2557000	The HTC Droid Incredible
2557000	2559000	The HTC Wildfire
2559000	2561000	The HTC Magic 32A
2561000	2563000	The Dream G1
2563000	2565000	Magic 32B
2565000	2567000	These are all HTC Foams
2567000	2569000	The Palm Pre
2569000	2571000	The Dingu
2571000	2573000	I actually have a Dingu
2573000	2575000	I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet
2575000	2577000	But I may try that
2577000	2579000	The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1
2579000	2581000	The Nokia N900
2581000	2583000	Or N800 or N810
2583000	2585000	The Droid
2585000	2587000	The Droid
2587000	2589000	Aris
2589000	2591000	Of course, the original
2591000	2593000	Oh, and the Palm Pre
2593000	2595000	Yeah, so basically
2595000	2597000	Everything
2597000	2599000	And if it's not out for your device
2599000	2601000	It will probably be ported to it
2601000	2603000	You know
2603000	2605000	I guess it's not such a bad thing if
2605000	2607000	You know, you're really interested
2607000	2609000	In actually putting this
2609000	2611000	You know, exploit on your console
2611000	2613000	It should be readily available
2613000	2615000	To do so
2615000	2617000	And if it's not for stuff that you may have
2617000	2619000	At home right now, it will be probably soon
2619000	2621000	I'm sure, you know
2621000	2623000	A piece of French toast will eventually be able to be
2623000	2625000	Used in hacking your
2625000	2627000	PS3, so
2627000	2629000	Just have to give it some time
2629000	2631000	I did forget to mention
2631000	2633000	Earlier in the show that because
2633000	2635000	You know, you're now officially 30, right Loki?
2635000	2637000	Yes I am
2637000	2639000	So now it's officially the gaming show for
2639000	2641000	30-somethings is Orange Lounge
2641000	2643000	Radio, that's right
2643000	2645000	The old crotchety video gaming show
2645000	2647000	We actually have a new theme song
2647000	2649000	For the new Orange Lounge Radio, we're gonna be debuting
2649000	2651000	Do we? Yeah, we should have done it tonight
2651000	2653000	But we'll do it next week
2653000	2655000	Since we're so old, here's our new theme song you guys
2655000	2657000	Thank you for being a friend
2657000	2659000	That old
2659000	2661000	Rob your dork
2661000	2663000	Back in my day
2663000	2665000	Oregon and
2665000	2667000	Trail was in green, and only green
2667000	2669000	And we liked it
2669000	2671000	Hey
2671000	2673000	On the DSI
2673000	2675000	There's a new firmware update as well
2675000	2677000	The 1.4.1U
2677000	2679000	It's a new update on the DSI firmware
2679000	2681000	Guess what it does?
2681000	2683000	Ah yes, it blocks piracy
2683000	2685000	And certain flash carts and all that stuff
2685000	2687000	Try to block piracy
2687000	2689000	Copying games is bad
2689000	2691000	I get that, but these types of things also block out
2691000	2693000	The homebrew, which is the really fun stuff
2693000	2695000	So anyway the new firmware update
2695000	2697000	On the DSI, it's the first update they've done
2697000	2699000	In about a year, no new functionality
2699000	2701000	It just does quote
2701000	2703000	Behind the scenes improvements to system
2703000	2705000	Performance, which means
2705000	2707000	Some of the flash cartridges that allowed
2707000	2709000	The lead hack source, no longer work
2709000	2711000	Some of the affected carts are
2711000	2713000	The ace card 2i, the super card
2713000	2715000	The DS2, the M3i0
2715000	2717000	The iPlayer, and the DSTTI
2717000	2719000	I didn't even know all these things existed
2719000	2721000	Did you know about the existence of
2721000	2723000	All these carts? I've never heard of half of these
2723000	2725000	Yeah
2725000	2727000	There's a lot of them out there, most people just
2727000	2729000	Know the R4
2729000	2731000	Some carts did manage to
2731000	2733000	Escape the patch
2733000	2735000	The iSmart DS, the EZ Flash
2735000	2737000	And the Hyper R4
2737000	2739000	Ah yes, the R4
2739000	2741000	So there you go
2741000	2743000	It's possible
2743000	2745000	That they will have like you know
2745000	2747000	Firmware updates to the actual cards themselves
2747000	2749000	That may re-enable them
2749000	2751000	It's a back and forth game
2751000	2753000	You know
2753000	2755000	I get it, I mean they
2755000	2757000	Have, they owe it to their developers
2757000	2759000	And they owe it to themselves to try and
2759000	2761000	Stop piracy
2761000	2763000	But it does kind of stink that there isn't at least
2763000	2765000	Some type of open channel for homebrew
2765000	2767000	I mean I feel like the only group
2767000	2769000	Whatsoever that has somewhat
2769000	2771000	Embraced homebrew
2771000	2773000	Granted in an ultimately controlled environment
2773000	2775000	Is Microsoft and the indie games
2775000	2777000	But even then that's really controlled
2777000	2779000	Or even Apple with their app store
2779000	2781000	Yeah even though apps have to go through
2781000	2783000	Scores and scores of approvals
2783000	2785000	But you know what? There's fart apps galore
2785000	2787000	And all this stupid shit
2787000	2789000	Can you imagine if these people were able to
2789000	2791000	Program apps for like say
2791000	2793000	The Nintendo DSi
2793000	2795000	I mean it may be a little bit more difficult
2795000	2797000	But
2797000	2799000	It would be really interesting
2799000	2801000	I'm surprised Nintendo's DSi doesn't try to
2801000	2803000	Cash in on the app craze
2803000	2805000	And I thought it was to some extent
2805000	2807000	They have the DSi store and so forth
2807000	2809000	They're so behind though
2809000	2811000	Open it up to let people make their own things
2811000	2813000	Make them charge 99 cents for it
2813000	2815000	And take half
2815000	2817000	Well how long did it take them to finally come out with WiiWare
2817000	2819000	I mean seriously
2819000	2821000	They're so behind
2821000	2823000	So I'm not surprised
2823000	2825000	But yeah
2825000	2827000	I'm bummed for the homebrew
2827000	2829000	It's a little harder to feel sympathy
2829000	2831000	For pirates
2831000	2833000	The jig is up kids
2833000	2835000	But for homebrew you're kinda like oh
2835000	2837000	Bummer
2837000	2839000	There's also another update to the Wii
2839000	2841000	System firmware as well
2841000	2843000	It's actually still marked as the current firmware
2843000	2845000	But it will remove all the
2845000	2847000	Homebrew that you have installed on your system
2847000	2849000	So
2849000	2851000	But does the exploit still work?
2851000	2853000	Or did they patch that too?
2853000	2855000	It goes in and takes out all the homebrew
2855000	2857000	They keep patching it and they keep finding ways
2857000	2859000	Around it so
2859000	2861000	Yes and no I don't know at this point
2861000	2863000	Interesting
2863000	2865000	It's not done with Legend of Zelda anymore
2865000	2867000	They can do it easier so
2867000	2869000	Well we'll see what firmware is released on a system
2869000	2871000	Next week that takes something away
2871000	2873000	Without adding anything
2873000	2875000	Dark Sakura in the meantime
2875000	2877000	What do you got for us in Other Worlds of Gaming?
2877000	2879000	We're actually having a discussion about food in the chatroom
2879000	2881000	What kind of food? Jewish food
2881000	2883000	Rollie pollie fish heads from Jessica Harper
2883000	2885000	That's not food I don't eat fish heads
2885000	2887000	Although I did eat something very unique
2887000	2889000	I had herring in sour cream
2889000	2891000	Was it good?
2891000	2893000	Yeah it actually was
2893000	2895000	But it was
2895000	2897000	Very interesting because they expected me to not like it
2897000	2899000	Or to make a face at it and I was like
2899000	2901000	This is pretty good I haven't
2901000	2903000	Eaten a whole lot of interesting food lately
2903000	2905000	We eat squirrel in Alabama Although
2905000	2907000	Alan cooked last night
2907000	2909000	It was really good
2909000	2911000	He did the chicken and his own little breadcrumb thing
2911000	2913000	It was really cute
2913000	2915000	I know
2915000	2917000	Now read the story
2917000	2919000	Read the damn story
2919000	2921000	That's so cute and gay
2921000	2923000	Well
2923000	2925000	For LittleBigPlanet 2
2925000	2927000	There is good news
2927000	2929000	That is if you played a lot of LittleBigPlanet
2929000	2931000	The first
2931000	2933000	And that is
2933000	2935000	The beta invites
2935000	2937000	Are going out but it's just for people
2937000	2939000	Who are super active in LittleBigPlanet
2939000	2941000	So I guess that they're
2941000	2943000	Checking
2943000	2945000	People who create upload
2945000	2947000	Who play regularly
2947000	2949000	So here's the major points
2949000	2951000	And also
2951000	2953000	They're not actually out recruiting
2953000	2955000	Beta testers
2955000	2957000	They're just sending the invites to people who play the game a lot
2957000	2959000	But some of those points are
2959000	2961000	You have to be 18 years or older
2961000	2963000	And be a resident
2963000	2965000	In a country which we operate
2965000	2967000	If you're reading the direct thing
2967000	2969000	Operate the Playstation store
2969000	2971000	The beta will be in English
2971000	2973000	So you have to provide feedback in English
2973000	2975000	And the beta test community
2975000	2977000	And the existing LittleBigPlanet
2977000	2979000	Beta testers will automatically
2979000	2981000	Be included in the beta trial
2981000	2983000	And it says
2983000	2985000	Please note that being selected for this beta
2985000	2987000	Does not give you access to other beta
2987000	2989000	Trials we may operate
2989000	2991000	The last thing is that participation
2991000	2993000	In the beta trials is subject to their beta
2993000	2995000	Trial agreement
2995000	2997000	Which I pretty much think means
2997000	2999000	Don't go spilling
2999000	3001000	All this crap to other people
3001000	3003000	Which is going to happen
3005000	3007000	I think that's a good way to do it
3007000	3009000	Because then they'll be
3009000	3011000	Giving it to people who understand the mechanics of the game
3011000	3013000	The more that you play something
3013000	3015000	Clearly the more you understand it
3015000	3017000	What Rob?
3017000	3019000	You looked funny
3019000	3021000	No I'm reading chat and having fun with them
3021000	3023000	But as far as
3023000	3025000	The way they're doing the beta invites
3025000	3027000	It makes sense, it's cute
3027000	3029000	It's a good way to do it
3029000	3031000	I didn't really get that much into LittleBigPlanet
3031000	3033000	I know I'm not getting invited
3033000	3035000	But why not
3035000	3037000	Get your hardcore community in there
3037000	3039000	Because they're the ones that are
3039000	3041000	A. Gonna most be shocked by the changes
3041000	3043000	And B. Probably test it the most
3043000	3045000	It makes sense
3045000	3047000	I'm surprised they don't do the same thing with World of Warcraft
3047000	3049000	Well maybe that is how they send out the invites
3049000	3051000	There's other ways you can get one
3051000	3053000	I got one, I probably shouldn't have it
3053000	3055000	But I do
3055000	3057000	Touch you
3057000	3059000	I actually haven't played it a whole lot
3059000	3061000	A lot is still borked in the World of Warcraft beta
3061000	3063000	What I really want in right now
3063000	3065000	Is the DC Universe beta
3065000	3067000	That's what I really want to play right now
3067000	3069000	You're not going to play Star Trek Online
3069000	3071000	You need to give that card to someone who will
3071000	3073000	I'll give it back if you really want it
3073000	3075000	I'll check it out someday
3075000	3077000	You have to play with me
3077000	3079000	In ten days
3079000	3081000	We'll go kill some Borg and smack some Klingons around
3081000	3083000	It'll be fun
3083000	3085000	Good times
3085000	3087000	There's got to be at least one other OLR listener that plays Star Trek Online
3087000	3089000	We'll have to hunt down Travis
3089000	3091000	Does he?
3091000	3093000	I would play just to attack his ship in the middle of the night
3093000	3095000	You'd have to play a Klingon
3095000	3097000	Rob!
3097000	3099000	I think you'd have to play a Klingon
3099000	3101000	Really?
3101000	3103000	And that means you'd actually have to level up a character
3103000	3105000	To I think Lieutenant Commander
3105000	3107000	The half Klingon, half human
3107000	3109000	You can sort of make one
3109000	3111000	You get this selection
3111000	3113000	I don't know how we got from Little Big Planet
3113000	3115000	Oh, we just broke the show with too much nerdiness
3115000	3117000	Oh, that's too bad
3117000	3119000	You get an option to choose
3119000	3121000	Alien
3121000	3123000	And then you can customize them however you want them to look
3123000	3125000	I see
3125000	3127000	Alright, let's move on Loki
3127000	3129000	Well, digital distribution seems to be
3129000	3131000	Catching on everywhere else
3131000	3133000	So why not the arcade?
3133000	3135000	I'm just going to at least try it
3135000	3137000	And they've introduced a new digital distribution system
3137000	3139000	Called Nesica X Live
3139000	3141000	And this was being shown off
3141000	3143000	At the 48th amusement machine show
3143000	3145000	In Chiba
3145000	3147000	And apparently
3147000	3149000	It will allow arcade operators
3149000	3151000	To purchase cabinets
3151000	3153000	And then download games to the cabinets
3153000	3155000	Including a bunch of older titles
3155000	3157000	As well as brand new releases
3157000	3159000	They said that 9 arcade game makers
3159000	3161000	Are supporting the platform
3161000	3163000	Including SNK
3163000	3165000	And CAVE
3165000	3167000	And the first title release for the system
3167000	3169000	Will be none other than Taito's
3169000	3171000	BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2
3171000	3173000	And
3173000	3175000	That's kind of interesting
3175000	3177000	I don't know if they'll ever make it out over here like that
3177000	3179000	I don't see why not
3179000	3181000	I don't know
3181000	3183000	It kind of makes me wonder though
3183000	3185000	I assume this is going to be very similar to
3185000	3187000	How they have the CPS2
3187000	3189000	And 3 systems and stuff like that
3189000	3191000	Where it's just a cartridge based
3191000	3193000	System but instead of a cartridge
3193000	3195000	It's going to be a hard drive with
3195000	3197000	A programmer
3197000	3199000	Or I guess actually the new Taito system
3199000	3201000	Is actually run off of a Windows XP system
3201000	3203000	I just have a feeling
3203000	3205000	These will be easily dumped
3205000	3207000	And stolen because
3207000	3209000	Well no seriously if you think about it
3209000	3211000	Because it's going to have
3211000	3213000	The same front end
3213000	3215000	That's going to be running all these games
3215000	3217000	And all you're going to be doing is exchanging out
3217000	3219000	The actual
3219000	3221000	Game data
3221000	3223000	So if you
3223000	3225000	Put out that
3225000	3227000	Program
3227000	3229000	Then people are going to be able to
3229000	3231000	Just dump the game data and all these
3231000	3233000	Arcade games will leak
3233000	3235000	Despite all this back alley stuff that you're talking about
3235000	3237000	When it comes to this system
3237000	3239000	What do you think of this system as a way to possibly
3239000	3241000	Revitalize arcades? I think it's a neat idea
3241000	3243000	It's kind of like taking something from the home
3243000	3245000	Consoles that's working well and putting it in arcades
3245000	3247000	Haven't we seen this happen to some extent already
3247000	3249000	Like a little bit
3249000	3251000	Like I know some of the later Bamani games do this
3251000	3253000	With the whole emusment and so forth
3253000	3255000	And I think Technica does the same thing
3255000	3257000	And I even think some of the fighting games are doing this now
3257000	3259000	With some type of digital delivery right?
3259000	3261000	I think it's a good idea in the sense that it will
3261000	3263000	Save arcade operators at least
3263000	3265000	If they were to implement this in the states
3265000	3267000	A whole lot of
3267000	3269000	Shipping costs because shipping
3269000	3271000	Arcade games is not cheap
3271000	3273000	At all and
3273000	3275000	Is that first hand?
3275000	3277000	Yes somewhat
3277000	3279000	I know that too because I priced
3279000	3281000	Trying to get a baby pacman machine
3281000	3283000	Because that's how bad I wanted one
3283000	3285000	And honestly the machine itself I could afford
3285000	3287000	It was the shipping that was going to kill me
3287000	3289000	To get one of those machines
3289000	3291000	That's how bad I want that stupid machine
3291000	3293000	A baby pacman?
3293000	3295000	I know
3295000	3297000	I'll track one down for you
3297000	3299000	Finding one locally maybe
3299000	3301000	That would be cool
3301000	3303000	Shipping is expensive
3303000	3305000	So um
3305000	3307000	I mean granted that they wouldn't be shipping
3307000	3309000	A new cabinet each time
3309000	3311000	They would just be doing a cartridge
3311000	3313000	Or something like that
3313000	3315000	If it were any other system
3315000	3317000	But even still
3317000	3319000	That's one less expense
3319000	3321000	They have to deal with
3321000	3323000	Although then they have to have internet
3323000	3325000	So maybe it evens itself out
3325000	3327000	But at least when a game is released
3327000	3329000	They can have it there relatively quick
3329000	3331000	Because you know if you were overnight
3331000	3333000	A cabinet from you know
3333000	3335000	Japan or something like that
3335000	3337000	That would cost millions of dollars
3337000	3339000	That boat would have to go very fast
3339000	3341000	To get the machine over here
3341000	3343000	Speed boat
3343000	3345000	You'd have to get Johnny Quest
3345000	3347000	To get that machine out here that fast
3347000	3349000	Alright
3349000	3351000	Well I think it's a really interesting
3351000	3353000	Idea and I could see arcades going that way
3353000	3355000	But is it going to be enough to save them?
3355000	3357000	I don't know
3357000	3359000	No one gives a crap how the games get to the arcade
3359000	3361000	It's just what games are at the arcade
3361000	3363000	What do you think they could do
3363000	3365000	And we have this conversation once in a while
3365000	3367000	On the show and I'll open this up to the chat too
3367000	3369000	What do you think they could do to an arcade
3369000	3371000	To make people come back?
3371000	3373000	Give them something that they can't get at home
3373000	3375000	With consoles
3375000	3377000	That's really it
3377000	3379000	Right now it's very difficult
3379000	3381000	To come up with that kind of stuff
3381000	3383000	Because
3383000	3385000	Lately it's community
3385000	3387000	For the past ten years or so
3387000	3389000	It's the DDR community obviously
3389000	3391000	What this show owes its roots to
3391000	3393000	Or fighting game communities
3393000	3395000	You can't readily get that stuff at home
3395000	3397000	You can buy some homemade
3397000	3399000	Or really expensive dance pads
3399000	3401000	And stuff
3401000	3403000	But it's still not the same as the arcade
3403000	3405000	But now
3405000	3407000	With Guitar Hero and stuff
3407000	3409000	Guitar Freaks is kind of
3409000	3411000	A done deal
3411000	3413000	And the Guitar Hero arcade game
3413000	3415000	Is just dumb
3415000	3417000	S2-100 Matt in chat says free blowjobs
3417000	3419000	Insert quarter, insert wiener
3419000	3421000	That's not an arcade game
3421000	3423000	Okay, that's a peep show
3423000	3425000	Free spankings
3425000	3427000	Or like an Asian massage parlor
3427000	3429000	That is not an arcade
3429000	3431000	Now they put an arcade in
3433000	3435000	Was that during the part of the marathon
3435000	3437000	You were here for?
3437000	3439000	I don't think I was here for any part of the marathon
3439000	3441000	I don't remember if it was in the first three hours
3441000	3443000	I think that you were gone
3443000	3445000	But Rob played this funny YouTube video
3445000	3447000	It was Allen
3447000	3449000	The happy ending
3449000	3451000	I'll find it, keep talking
3451000	3453000	Get ready to wreck
3453000	3455000	So
3455000	3457000	I don't know if there's a lot they can do to revitalize
3457000	3459000	It's just basically bringing out games that are
3459000	3461000	Going to be
3461000	3463000	Able to do stuff that you can't
3463000	3465000	Really do at home
3465000	3467000	You know the big old gun games
3467000	3469000	Just giving people a reason to come to the arcade
3469000	3471000	Kind of
3471000	3473000	This is from Mediocre Films on YouTube
3473000	3475000	They get full credit for this
3475000	3477000	Mediocre Films is the name of the YouTube here
3477000	3479000	This is called
3479000	3481000	Happy ending
3481000	3483000	Here you go, Loki
3483000	3485000	Link it in the chatroom too
3489000	3491000	You like?
3491000	3501000	Ohh
3501000	3503000	She's sitting on his butt
3503000	3505000	I love the generic Asian restaurant music
3505000	3507000	They play in the background
3507000	3523000	Don't overplay
3523000	3525000	She just took her dress off
3525000	3527000	You liking this, Loki?
3527000	3529000	Good movie, huh?
3529000	3531000	His head is totally not laying on that right
3531000	3533000	You're not supposed to lay on the little
3533000	3535000	Happy ending
3535000	3537000	Okay
3537000	3539000	Okay
3539000	3541000	Happy ending
3545000	3547000	There's like clowns and a juggler
3547000	3549000	And puppets
3549000	3551000	And balloons
3551000	3553000	This is what they need at arcades
3557000	3559000	And they all leave
3559000	3561000	She's clapping
3561000	3563000	Are you happy now?
3563000	3565000	It wasn't what I was hoping for
3565000	3567000	Oh no
3567000	3569000	Maybe you want a hand jive
3569000	3571000	$50
3571000	3573000	For a
3573000	3575000	Hand jive, right?
3575000	3577000	Yeah, hand jive
3577000	3579000	Yeah, okay
3579000	3581000	Okay
3581000	3583000	Hand jive
3583000	3587000	Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
3587000	3589000	Get into hand jive
3589000	3591000	Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
3591000	3593000	Like grease
3599000	3601000	See, wasn't that worth derailing the entire show to watch?
3601000	3603000	Yes it was
3603000	3605000	Wasn't that awesome radio making the listeners
3605000	3607000	Listen to a movie?
3607000	3609000	It's hilarious
3609000	3611000	Please show that to Nelly when you get home
3611000	3613000	I will
3613000	3615000	Tell her we send it with love
3615000	3617000	Speaking of things that don't make sense
3617000	3619000	Just like us playing a video
3619000	3621000	On a radio show
3621000	3623000	The PSP Go
3623000	3625000	Did you like that segue?
3625000	3627000	That was an excellent segue
3627000	3629000	Kazurai, the PS boss
3629000	3631000	Of course
3631000	3633000	This week has admitted
3633000	3635000	In an interview with
3635000	3637000	MCVUK.com
3637000	3639000	That the $250
3639000	3641000	Pricing could perhaps
3641000	3643000	Have been the problem
3643000	3645000	Behind the sale
3645000	3647000	Matter of fact it was a poor design
3647000	3649000	In the first place
3649000	3651000	Let me give you the quote here
3651000	3653000	Which Darkcoagackenchat calls the PSP No
3653000	3655000	Quote
3655000	3657000	I think we need to make sure we have as many titles
3657000	3659000	Available to download as possible
3659000	3661000	To make the experience as easy as possible
3661000	3663000	But also pricing
3663000	3665000	Is perhaps an issue
3665000	3667000	Because of the cost reductions
3667000	3669000	We've been able to do over the years
3669000	3671000	The traditional PSP has benefited
3671000	3673000	But the PSP Go is a completely different design
3673000	3675000	So the cost trend is different
3675000	3677000	So
3677000	3679000	There you go
3679000	3681000	No I don't
3681000	3687000	Was maybe pricing the problem with the PSP Go
3687000	3689000	You think possibly
3689000	3691000	Perhaps that you put out a skew with
3691000	3693000	Less features
3693000	3695000	And then
3695000	3697000	I don't know, offered it for a more
3697000	3699000	Expensive price
3699000	3701000	And then I don't know
3701000	3703000	Just utterly stopped supporting it
3703000	3705000	Because you know you haven't really
3705000	3707000	Released any sort of bundles
3707000	3709000	Oh that's because you can't bundle anything with it
3709000	3711000	Because it doesn't have a UMD drive
3711000	3713000	To play the games that would be bundled with it
3713000	3715000	Ah fun
3715000	3717000	You could give a card for a free download
3717000	3719000	Yeah everybody likes cards
3719000	3721000	Dungeon buster in our chat room says
3721000	3723000	Thank you for giving me work to do
3723000	3725000	And I have to go online and download the title
3725000	3727000	Dungeon buster in our chat room
3727000	3729000	At chat.orangeslawnsherd.com says
3729000	3731000	I love how Sony spins failure
3731000	3733000	That was a good spin of failure don't you think
3733000	3735000	Perhaps, perhaps
3735000	3737000	Just maybe
3737000	3739000	It was possibly the fact
3739000	3741000	That the pricing
3741000	3743000	Is what ruined it
3743000	3745000	Perhaps
3745000	3747000	I'm not sure
3747000	3749000	We have some analysts we're paying money to look into right now
3749000	3751000	But perhaps
3751000	3753000	Let me tell you for free
3753000	3755000	Yes that was the issue
3755000	3757000	It was definitely the pricing
3757000	3759000	Was the issue
3759000	3761000	The pricing for flimsy piece of crap
3761000	3765000	I saw a PSP go in one of those fancy vending machines the other day
3765000	3767000	It kind of made me laugh a little bit
3767000	3771000	Well there was somebody in one of my history classes that had it for class
3771000	3773000	And I said okay you gotta let me see that
3773000	3775000	So I tried playing a little bit
3775000	3777000	That mic is not your friend right now
3777000	3779000	What? I'm holding it together
3779000	3781000	I'm just saying it's cutting in and out
3781000	3783000	I don't write the rules of electronics
3783000	3785000	I just tell you what it is
3785000	3787000	Rob
3787000	3789000	Rob
3789000	3791000	Yes person in your electronics class
3791000	3793000	At any rate
3793000	3795000	I got to play one because a guy in my
3795000	3797000	One of my history classes
3797000	3799000	Was playing one and I said you gotta let me
3799000	3801000	Try it and I was like yeah
3801000	3803000	Piece of crap
3803000	3805000	I'm sorry you're not going to appreciate this but I know we're talking about
3805000	3807000	The PSP go right now and it really smells like
3807000	3809000	Shermie took a caca like is it just me
3809000	3811000	That smells that
3811000	3813000	She went go
3813000	3815000	I want to see if she really did take
3815000	3817000	She did
3817000	3819000	Shermie does not like the
3819000	3821000	PSP go
3821000	3823000	Your cat has
3823000	3825000	Impeccable comic timing
3825000	3827000	I just want to say
3827000	3829000	I don't think dark soccer appreciates that
3829000	3831000	Shermie
3831000	3833000	Bad kitty
3833000	3835000	I don't think we're allowed to talk about the PSP go anymore
3835000	3837000	Shermie
3837000	3839000	has therefore ended the conversation by
3839000	3841000	Taking a dump
3841000	3843000	In the middle of the floor
3843000	3845000	It stinks that dark soccer
3845000	3847000	Has the next story so we'll just
3847000	3849000	We'll just sit here and think about that for a moment
3851000	3853000	Hi
3853000	3855000	Poopy butt
3855000	3857000	Okay and you want to know
3857000	3859000	I have to say this
3859000	3861000	For the amount of stink that comes out of that cat's ass
3861000	3863000	Her poop
3863000	3865000	Her little poop
3865000	3867000	Was about the size of an Ikea meatball
3869000	3871000	Thank you for that comparison
3871000	3873000	Sweetest meatballs will never be the same
3873000	3875000	That means that she couldn't even give
3875000	3877000	A full sized cat crap
3877000	3879000	About the PSP go
3879000	3881000	I love my cat
3881000	3883000	And she's sitting under the pinball table like
3883000	3885000	I did it
3885000	3887000	Her little sassy fat butt
3893000	3895000	So need for speed MMO
3895000	3897000	Have you played it?
3897000	3899000	I haven't
3899000	3901000	He actually really likes it but you can only get up to level 10
3901000	3903000	Before you have to actually pay for it
3903000	3905000	But not anymore
3905000	3907000	Because need for speed world
3907000	3909000	Once it hit 1 million registered users
3909000	3911000	It actually is now free to play
3911000	3913000	No more charge
3913000	3915000	But
3915000	3917000	You still have to buy boosts
3917000	3919000	And double XP bonuses and that type of thing
3919000	3921000	So
3921000	3923000	I hate the word
3923000	3925000	The combination microtransaction
3925000	3927000	I just think it's stupid
3927000	3929000	A transaction
3929000	3931000	Is a transaction
3931000	3933000	I'm just saying all those media sites use it
3933000	3935000	It's just kind of one of those things
3935000	3937000	And they're all stupid
3937000	3939000	A transaction is a transaction
3939000	3941000	Oh and it's like the gods above
3941000	3943000	Just pulled the cord on your mic
3943000	3945000	Ugh
3945000	3947000	Sony dislikes your comments about their transaction
3947000	3949000	A transaction is a transaction
3949000	3951000	They should just call it
3951000	3953000	Payment
3953000	3955000	You have to pay for this stuff
3955000	3957000	Money is money
3957000	3959000	A little money is still money
3959000	3961000	Damn you people
3961000	3963000	So is the game fun? I'm interested in it
3963000	3965000	Dan likes it
3965000	3967000	And he likes doing the
3967000	3969000	Getting the bonuses where you run through
3969000	3971000	Police barriers and that type of thing
3971000	3973000	You know
3973000	3975000	It gives you points for
3975000	3977000	How many cops get injured I guess
3977000	3979000	Which is kind of wrong
3979000	3981000	But you know
3981000	3983000	It's actually pretty cool
3983000	3985000	I think they have just a couple of
3985000	3987000	Cars that you can pick from right now
3987000	3989000	At least at the level that he's at
3989000	3991000	But it's like playing Need for Speed on the system
3991000	3993000	Except you just
3993000	3995000	Truck all over the town on your computer
3995000	3997000	He likes it
3997000	3999000	He says that he would rather play it with a wheel
3999000	4001000	Than use the
4001000	4003000	Keyboard like he's been doing
4003000	4005000	The keys gotta stink
4005000	4007000	Maybe a 360 controller would work better though
4007000	4009000	Maybe a little better than the keys
4009000	4011000	Zebun Artarum says you guys gotta get a new mic
4011000	4013000	I think, I hope it's not the mic
4013000	4015000	That's the newest mic in the studio
4015000	4017000	It's probably the cord, not the mic
4017000	4019000	Something maybe happened where the mic fell
4019000	4021000	Or something and shorted
4021000	4023000	One of the wires, I don't know
4023000	4025000	It slides out just a little bit
4025000	4027000	I think that I just need to get a new mic cable
4027000	4029000	Yeah, hopefully that's it
4029000	4031000	Or we could take the mic cable from a working mic
4031000	4033000	That might be the solution
4033000	4035000	That one's not detachable
4035000	4037000	Yeah it is, at the bottom
4037000	4039000	Maybe we could try that during the break and see if that works
4039000	4041000	I can hold it
4041000	4043000	I can hold it, I'm a big girl
4043000	4045000	Let's travel around the world
4045000	4047000	And look at some release dates
4047000	4049000	And what's coming to a console near you
4049000	4051000	We'll start in the USA

4081000	4083000	What's special about it?
4083000	4085000	Well they updated some of the games so it's more like the TV show is now
4085000	4087000	Other than that it's not that special
4087000	4089000	That will be out on the Wii this week as well

4137000	4139000	Or a synopsis
4139000	4141000	But if I want to remember I believe that you have to

4189000	4191000	Extravagant

4195000	4197000	And posh

4199000	4201000	Confident

4289000	4291000	Frisbee says Fancy Nancy
4291000	4293000	In the meth lab

4321000	4323000	Spooky Swamp out on the Wii
4323000	4325000	And the DS

4327000	4329000	Maybe the Playstation 2
4329000	4331000	Who cares, it sucks
4331000	4333000	Frisbee's suggesting Fancy Nancy in the meth lab
4333000	4335000	That's what I said
4335000	4337000	That's what she's really gathering the supplies for
4337000	4339000	I thought you said Dark Tattoo, sorry
4339000	4341000	Truth or Lies
4341000	4343000	It's a game
4343000	4345000	On the PS3, Xbox 360
4345000	4347000	And the Wii
4347000	4349000	You
4349000	4351000	Are challenged to
4351000	4353000	Lie to your friends I guess
4353000	4355000	I don't really know what the hell the point of this is
4355000	4357000	Bring the party into your living room
4357000	4359000	Inspire hilarious discussions and learn about your friends
4359000	4361000	As deep dark
4361000	4363000	Secrets are revealed
4363000	4365000	It's time to uncover who is telling the truth
4365000	4367000	And who is flat out lying
4367000	4369000	I'm guessing that it has some sort of way to tell
4369000	4371000	If you're a liar or not
4371000	4373000	Maybe, otherwise this game is lame
4373000	4377000	AkumaJP suggests Fancy Nancy's happy ending
4379000	4381000	Fancy Nancy's hand job
4381000	4383000	Or Fancy Hand Job I guess
4385000	4387000	Legends of the Guardian
4387000	4389000	Owls of Gahool coming out on

4397000	4399000	Right again on the DS
4399000	4401000	If you like that cartoon series I guess

4403000	4405000	What?
4405000	4407000	I freaking love Phineas and Ferb
4407000	4409000	That show is crack
4409000	4411000	I would play a game
4411000	4413000	And she has
4413000	4415000	Sipped the
4415000	4417000	Disney Kool-Aid
4417000	4419000	Racket Sports coming out on
4419000	4421000	Playstation 3 this week
4421000	4423000	This is very similar to the game
4423000	4425000	That was out on the Wii
4425000	4427000	It's like Wii Sports
4427000	4429000	Lord of the Rings
4429000	4431000	Aragorn's quest on the
4431000	4433000	Playstation 2, the PS3
4433000	4435000	The Wii, the DS and the
4435000	4437000	PSP, of course the PS3 version
4437000	4439000	Works with the Playstation Move
4439000	4441000	And is equally lame
4441000	4443000	Gladiator begins
4443000	4445000	Not a prequel to the
4445000	4447000	Gladiator movie but it is
4447000	4449000	A gladiator combat game
4449000	4451000	There are a lot of games I don't care about
4451000	4453000	Coming out this week
4453000	4455000	Me too and I'm covering all of them
4455000	4457000	Alpha and Omega

4515000	4517000	Wonder what you do in that
4517000	4519000	That's a

4563000	4565000	The Fantasy Star Portable on the PSP
4565000	4567000	And finally, it's not really a game
4567000	4569000	But it's coming out this week, the PlayStation Move

4571000	4573000	And

4579000	4581000	Sports champions
4581000	4583000	Or whatever game
4583000	4585000	Is out, despite the douchebag
4585000	4587000	And the GameStop saying
4587000	4589000	Well it doesn't come out until the 17th
4589000	4591000	Yeah the bundle doesn't come out until the 17th
4591000	4593000	You idiot

4615000	4617000	See I don't know, is
4617000	4619000	Halo Reach as big of a deal overseas as it is here
4619000	4621000	I would think
4621000	4623000	It's still like
4623000	4625000	It's like a B game
4625000	4627000	It's up there but not like way up there
4627000	4629000	PlayStation 3, front mission evolved
4629000	4631000	Is there as well
4631000	4633000	As well as Mobile Suit Gundam Senkai
4633000	4635000	Record UC 0081
4635000	4637000	That's just a price reduction though
4637000	4639000	That game's actually already been out
4639000	4641000	Moving over to the Nintendo Wii and seeing what
4641000	4643000	Glorious games they're getting over there in Japan
4643000	4645000	Let's see
4645000	4647000	Deca Sports 3 is this week
4647000	4649000	Wii to Sports 10
4649000	4651000	Shimoku comes out this week in the pretty popular
4651000	4653000	Deca Sports series, that series does pretty well for Hudson
4653000	4655000	Doesn't it?
4655000	4657000	It's like Wii Sports never dies
4657000	4659000	Nothing really notable on the PlayStation 2
4659000	4661000	But I do have the Nintendo DS
4661000	4663000	Jinsai Game QDS
4663000	4665000	Heisei no Dekigoto
4665000	4667000	That is also a price reduction that's moving into the best
4667000	4669000	Otherwise not a lot of new games this week
4669000	4671000	Although on the 18th, there's all these
4671000	4673000	Like new covers coming out
4673000	4675000	If you want to get covers for your
4675000	4677000	DSI in different colors, you have that to look forward to
4677000	4679000	Ooh, this ought to be good though
4679000	4681000	On the Sony PSP, here's a big week
4681000	4683000	Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5
4683000	4685000	Cause I know there's some Closet Yu-Gi-Oh! fans out there
4685000	4691000	Dissida Final Fantasy Universal Tuning is ultimate hits
4691000	4693000	So Square sometimes does this with their games
4693000	4695000	They put out kind of like an international version later on
4695000	4697000	I'm assuming it's kind of this version of this
4697000	4699000	Also a game called Blue Roses
4699000	4707000	Yosai to Aoi Hitomi no Senshi Tashi comes out this week
4707000	4709000	Oh, I think that's uh, hold on
4709000	4711000	It's Blue Roses
4711000	4713000	It's a strategy game
4713000	4715000	I was looking at the title
4715000	4717000	Oh sorry, it's an RPG pretty much
4717000	4721000	This game's from Nippon Ichi Entertainment
4721000	4723000	Who makes a lot of the games
4723000	4725000	Just looks like your typical Japanese RPG honestly
4725000	4727000	With your little anime cutscenes
4727000	4729000	It looks cute, looks cute
4729000	4731000	I'm sure there'll be some people that want to import that
4731000	4733000	That's it for Japanese releases
4733000	4735000	How about The Old Kingdom?
4735000	4737000	Oh, we have a number of things over there
4737000	4739000	Taylor Reach, and then Legend of the Guardians
4739000	4741000	The Owls of Gahool
4741000	4743000	Oh, that's not from that book
4743000	4745000	That was that movie, right?
4745000	4747000	A book and a movie, yeah
4747000	4749000	There's Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Swamp
4749000	4751000	Final Fantasy Tactics
4751000	4753000	The War of the Lions on iPhone
4753000	4755000	Sounds fun
4755000	4757000	Flight Control, Kung Fu Rider
4757000	4759000	and PlayStation Move on the 15th
4759000	4761000	As well as also on the 15th
4761000	4763000	Sonic Adventure for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
4763000	4765000	And Sports Champions
4765000	4767000	And Start the Party
4767000	4769000	And closing up the week
4769000	4771000	On the 17th we have Lionheart
4771000	4773000	King's Crusade on PC
4773000	4775000	R.U.S.E
4775000	4777000	And Two Worlds 2
4777000	4779000	Of course, there's a game coming out next week
4779000	4781000	That totally makes me laugh by the name Deathspank
4781000	4783000	That's funny
4783000	4785000	Nice
4785000	4787000	Quick question from your chatroom
4787000	4789000	Spyro's asking, what about Final Fantasy 14?
4789000	4793000	I believe it's out in two weeks on the PC
4793000	4795000	At the end of the month
4795000	4797000	Yeah, and my list for Japanese releases doesn't cover the PC
4797000	4799000	So I'm not sure when it's coming out of there
4799000	4801000	PlayStation 3 is not until next year
4801000	4803000	And I think that's the same
4803000	4805000	Be it Japan or the U.S.
4805000	4807000	I think PC is getting the first crack at that
4807000	4809000	And Collector's Edition is what, the 22nd?
4809000	4811000	I think regular people get in on the 30th
4811000	4815000	I'm a little skeptical about Final Fantasy 14
4815000	4817000	I don't know, I'm weird though
4817000	4819000	I feel like I need to buy it
4819000	4823000	I need to give the retail game a good old fashioned college try
4823000	4825000	I need to try it
4825000	4827000	And see what I really think of it
4827000	4831000	But then again, I'm like, oh wow, but that beta was so bad
4831000	4833000	But I don't know
4833000	4835000	I'm really torn, that's where I'm at
4835000	4837000	We'll see, to be continued
4837000	4841000	It really depends, probably like, do I have money to spend on Final Fantasy 14 or not
4841000	4843000	That's really what it's going to come down to, probably
4843000	4847000	Alright, let's move on with some other news
4847000	4849000	We're going to talk to Game of the Week here in just a little bit
4849000	4851000	Here on the show, Loki
4851000	4853000	Ah yes, so
4853000	4855000	It's kind of interesting
4855000	4857000	For the longest time I remember
4857000	4859000	Apple was so
4859000	4861000	Adamant about not
4861000	4863000	Supporting Flash in
4863000	4865000	Their applications, well
4865000	4867000	That may change soon actually
4867000	4869000	They're going to relax some of the
4869000	4871000	IOS
4871000	4873000	Development restrictions
4873000	4875000	Including the
4875000	4877000	Use now of third party
4877000	4879000	Tools like Flash CS5
4879000	4881000	So apparently
4881000	4883000	New apps now can be developed with that in mind
4883000	4885000	That's kind of cool
4885000	4887000	So maybe
4887000	4889000	I don't know, we'll get some more apps that way
4889000	4891000	Maybe a better web browser
4891000	4893000	Does that mean it's easier to make apps now
4893000	4895000	Because people have been asking for an
4895000	4897000	OLR app for forever
4897000	4899000	I'm kind of like, I don't know
4899000	4901000	Flash I guess
4901000	4903000	I don't know what to put in an OLR app
4903000	4905000	Did it ever get put back in the store though?
4905000	4907000	I heard that it was gone from the store
4907000	4909000	For a little while, I don't know if it ever came back
4909000	4911000	I don't know. What else would be on an OLR app
4911000	4913000	That's not already on the all games app
4913000	4915000	I don't know. I can think of a few things
4915000	4917000	I know one of the other shows I've seen
4917000	4919000	Out there does like special shows
4919000	4921000	That you get if you buy the app
4921000	4923000	But I don't know
4923000	4925000	I don't know how I feel about that. We're too lazy for that
4925000	4927000	Yeah, and it's always kind of been like, you know, we've always put
4927000	4929000	Everything out there for free, I would feel bad to suddenly
4929000	4931000	Make, like if we're going to make people pay for things
4931000	4933000	We need to get those stupid shirts done
4933000	4935000	Or something like, you know, something really really extra
4935000	4937000	Beyond audio and video content
4937000	4939000	Which we've always done for free, you know
4939000	4941000	Not dogging on other shows
4941000	4943000	I, you know, everybody's got to
4943000	4945000	Pay the bills somehow, it's just, you know
4945000	4947000	We've never really made money off this show
4947000	4949000	And I don't think we're ever going to
4949000	4951000	And that's fine. It is what it is
4951000	4953000	Darktide Studio suggesting an
4953000	4955000	OLR and a USL combined soundboard
4955000	4957000	Now, okay, now that
4957000	4959000	I could, that's something a little extra
4959000	4961000	Perhaps, perhaps, we'll see
4963000	4965000	Alright, moving on
4965000	4967000	Let's see, oh, I like this
4967000	4969000	Oh, and Tigerclaw confirms the All Games app
4969000	4971000	Is still not back on the App Store
4971000	4973000	Well, maybe we need to put an app up there
4973000	4975000	Just so that there's something to tune into the radio show
4975000	4977000	On the go, I don't know, although I think Video Game
4977000	4979000	Outsiders have one
4979000	4981000	And that show's plenty fine, I like what they do over there
4981000	4983000	Mario
4983000	4985000	It's a hacky Mario game
4985000	4987000	Not really, more like a homebrew Mario game
4987000	4989000	It's created by Ben Weber
4989000	4991000	He's a candidate for his PhD in computer science
4991000	4993000	He goes to UC Santa Cruz
4993000	4995000	He's programmed a game
4995000	4997000	And it uses sprites from Super Mario World
4997000	4999000	So you could say it's homebrew
4999000	5001000	But what this game does is it's called
5001000	5003000	Infinite Adaptive Mario
5003000	5005000	And the level starts with
5005000	5007000	Moderate difficulty
5007000	5009000	But once you beat that, the next level gets harder
5009000	5011000	And gets harder and harder
5011000	5013000	Until you die three times in a row
5013000	5015000	Without completing a level
5015000	5017000	When it gets easier
5017000	5019000	And by the way, harder means yes, it gets
5019000	5021000	A lot harder
5021000	5023000	According to Weber, Infinite Adaptive Mario
5023000	5025000	Scales up difficulty by increasing
5025000	5027000	The frequency of gaps
5027000	5029000	Average size of gaps, variation of ground height
5029000	5031000	And a number of enemies
5031000	5033000	So in other words, as you get
5033000	5035000	Smarter, so does the game
5035000	5037000	And in some cases
5037000	5039000	If you look at some of these screenshots
5039000	5041000	There's like 16 monsters on the screen at once
5041000	5043000	Including piranha plants
5043000	5045000	That just fly in mid-air
5045000	5047000	That seems really hard
5047000	5049000	That looks crazy, I was looking at it
5049000	5051000	The author put Infinite Adaptive Mario
5051000	5053000	Up against an AI program
5053000	5055000	That completes randomly generated Mario levels
5055000	5057000	And there's this whole YouTube
5057000	5059000	On how that goes
5059000	5061000	That sounds kind of interesting actually
5061000	5063000	You can download it on
5063000	5065000	The website for UC Santa Cruz
5065000	5067000	But it is a little bit buggy
5067000	5069000	But that's kind of interesting
5069000	5071000	Although, I kind of think
5071000	5073000	Hasn't Nintendo gone that direction
5073000	5075000	A little bit, like games don't get
5075000	5077000	Harder necessarily, but didn't they put in
5077000	5079000	That controversial quote unquote system
5079000	5081000	A little while back where the levels get
5081000	5083000	Easier, or I guess the tutorials
5083000	5085000	Luigi tutorials come up if you're
5085000	5087000	Screwing up, like wasn't that in the Mario
5087000	5089000	Versus game, the new Super Mario Brothers
5089000	5091000	Wii, if you die like 8 times
5091000	5093000	In a level then you get the Luigi tutorial
5093000	5095000	Kind of interesting huh?
5095000	5097000	That's the, you suck
5097000	5099000	So we're going to teach you not to suck
5099000	5101000	Exactly
5101000	5103000	Uh, Loki you're playing that right now
5103000	5105000	I see you, I see you over there
5105000	5107000	You're playing it right now aren't you
5107000	5109000	I think he is, I was going to yeah
5109000	5111000	Except they don't tell you what the buttons are
5111000	5113000	Which makes it difficult, oh that might be kind of difficult
5113000	5115000	Alright hey uh
5115000	5117000	Let's get to the classic
5117000	5119000	Game of the week, it's a segment here on the show
5119000	5121000	Where we take a trip down memory lane
5123000	5125000	With the help of Dark Sakura and her gaming vault
5125000	5127000	To say hey
5127000	5129000	Here's a video game you little brats
5129000	5131000	Should be playing this week
5131000	5133000	And it's not Mario this week unfortunately
5133000	5135000	It's not related to this, but it is pretty cool right
5135000	5137000	Dark Sakura, Ice Cream Man
5137000	5139000	Oh yeah the Ice Cream Man
5139000	5141000	The Ice Cream Man's outside, I can't do the segment bye
5141000	5143000	No I'm kidding
5143000	5145000	Okay
5145000	5147000	Yes the classic game of the week is
5147000	5149000	Moonwalker
5149000	5151000	Specifically Michael Jackson's Moonwalker
5151000	5153000	Cause you know not to be confused with
5153000	5155000	Paula Abdul's Moonwalker
5155000	5157000	I'm going to start off on the arcade version
5159000	5161000	Cause the arcade version is
5161000	5163000	It's been hard to find lately
5163000	5165000	And it's different of course than the one we all remember on the Genesis
5165000	5167000	Which I think is pretty cool
5167000	5169000	Um
5169000	5171000	At any rate going with the arcade version
5171000	5173000	Um
5173000	5175000	You start off on sort of uh
5175000	5177000	It's technically side scrolling
5177000	5179000	But it goes
5179000	5181000	Diagonally
5181000	5183000	And you uh
5183000	5185000	It is a beat em up, you have magic powers
5185000	5187000	To attack with instead of actually just punching them
5187000	5189000	And you can shoot magic at them
5189000	5191000	And uh
5191000	5193000	You can also turn into the big robot
5193000	5195000	From uh
5195000	5197000	Which is the best thing ever
5197000	5199000	Yeah
5199000	5201000	And um
5201000	5203000	The player one is Michael in the white suit and hat
5203000	5205000	And then with the blue shirt
5205000	5207000	And then second player is
5207000	5209000	Red with white
5209000	5211000	And the third one is black with red
5211000	5213000	And they have those armands
5213000	5215000	You know that Michael Jackson is going to be really fond of
5215000	5217000	Um
5217000	5219000	Did you hear Michael's little scream there in between stages?
5219000	5221000	Wow
5221000	5223000	Hold on one more time
5223000	5225000	He saves the kid, he goes in the door
5225000	5227000	And then there's a cut scene
5227000	5229000	Round 2
5229000	5231000	Amusement quarter
5231000	5233000	Here we go, here we go
5233000	5235000	Wow
5235000	5237000	Although I love this little version of Smooth Criminal
5237000	5239000	That plays in the background
5239000	5241000	Let's listen to a little bit of it
5251000	5253000	Anyway
5253000	5255000	Um, of course he's got the uh
5255000	5257000	The dance magic
5257000	5259000	Which um, is sort of I guess
5259000	5261000	The smart bomb for the game
5261000	5263000	And uh
5263000	5265000	Basically um
5265000	5267000	You all get this sort of on screen
5267000	5269000	Logo
5269000	5271000	That you can activate it and then a spotlight lands
5271000	5273000	On you and you start to dance
5273000	5275000	Like regular
5275000	5277000	Michael Jackson moves
5277000	5279000	And then all the enemies on the screen start dancing
5279000	5281000	With you
5281000	5283000	And then they pass out because they
5283000	5285000	Can't keep up with Michael Jackson's
5285000	5287000	Smooth moves
5287000	5289000	Um, but it doesn't um
5289000	5291000	The bosses don't dance
5291000	5293000	They just take a lot of damage
5293000	5295000	And on screen children are not harmed of course
5295000	5297000	Michael has to rescue the kids
5297000	5299000	And then um
5299000	5301000	One of his power ups is Bubbles the Champion Z
5301000	5303000	And Bubbles
5303000	5305000	Is in each level and every time
5305000	5307000	You rescue
5307000	5309000	Rescue him he turns you into the giant robot
5309000	5311000	And then you can shoot lasers
5311000	5313000	Now
5313000	5315000	For the console
5315000	5317000	Of course this is what I'm sure people remember a lot
5317000	5319000	More of is uh
5319000	5321000	The one that came out on the Genesis
5321000	5323000	And
5323000	5325000	I like this one
5325000	5327000	Because when you go and do the dance magic thing
5327000	5329000	When you're standing on the piano everyone does the whole
5329000	5331000	Smooth criminal dance and that was just sweet
5331000	5333000	But that one was
5333000	5335000	Pretty cool and to go back to the
5335000	5337000	The uh songs that were in the game
5337000	5339000	For the arcade version the cavern one was bad
5339000	5341000	And the amusement quarter is smooth criminal
5341000	5343000	The night street is beat it
5343000	5345000	Graveyard is another part of me
5345000	5347000	And the evil fortress is uh
5347000	5349000	Another version of bad and then Billy Jean
5349000	5351000	Plays in the credits
5351000	5353000	And then on the Sega Genesis one
5353000	5355000	Which is more standard side scroller
5355000	5357000	Uh the stage one
5357000	5359000	Is smooth criminal
5359000	5361000	Stage two is beat it, stage three is another
5361000	5363000	Part of me, stage four is Billy Jean
5363000	5365000	And then you can perform like part of bad
5365000	5367000	And then stage five is bad with your special
5367000	5369000	Performance being smooth criminal beat it
5369000	5371000	Thriller if you have the REV-00
5371000	5373000	Version
5373000	5375000	Or another part of me which is the
5375000	5377000	REV-01
5377000	5379000	And uh he shouts
5379000	5381000	Woo
5381000	5383000	And in some of the cut scenes he says
5383000	5385000	Who's bad?
5385000	5387000	But he says his usual
5387000	5389000	Little catch phrases
5389000	5391000	And then um
5391000	5393000	But for the ad for the
5393000	5395000	Sega Genesis version it
5395000	5397000	Said that thriller was supposed to be
5397000	5399000	In the game but
5399000	5401000	It wasn't it's just the dance
5401000	5403000	Attack that's in
5403000	5405000	That one version in the
5405000	5407000	Last stage
5407000	5409000	Of course this isn't the only
5409000	5411000	Game that Michael Jackson has made appearances in
5411000	5413000	Uh there there was you know
5413000	5415000	Space channel five and space channel five part two
5415000	5417000	And he was a secret character and ready
5417000	5419000	To rumble boxing round two
5419000	5421000	So uh
5421000	5423000	That's pretty cool
5423000	5425000	But there was um
5425000	5427000	Also uh
5427000	5429000	Did you know that they were
5429000	5431000	Working on Michael Jackson
5431000	5433000	The experience game to be out on
5433000	5435000	Xbox 360? Yes it's um
5435000	5437000	Coming out it was gonna be out later this year
5437000	5439000	But I think it got pushed back next year now
5439000	5441000	It better be just like Moonwalker
5441000	5443000	I think it's supposed to be just like
5443000	5445000	Just dance
5445000	5447000	And singing in it
5447000	5449000	The game actually has
5449000	5451000	A rating on for
5451000	5453000	The PEGI has a rating for Wii's
5453000	5455000	Virtual console so
5455000	5457000	There's a talk that it should be out um
5457000	5459000	In Europe
5459000	5461000	So that's pretty cool
5461000	5463000	Cool game
5463000	5465000	Alright I don't care if people say it sucks
5465000	5467000	I completely disagree
5467000	5469000	No it was a cool arcade game
5469000	5471000	On the Genesis it was a little wonky but it was
5471000	5473000	You know it was Michael Jackson
5473000	5475000	It's all about the dance
5475000	5477000	But the best Michael Jackson game is space channel five part two
5477000	5479000	Oh yeah
5479000	5481000	Especially when you break out into the whole thriller dance
5481000	5483000	Oh that was awesome
5483000	5485000	Alright there it is your classic game of the week
5485000	5487000	Michael Jackson's Moonwalker for the arcade
5487000	5489000	Although Dark Soccer did reference the Genesis version as well
5489000	5491000	So that's gonna do it for part A of our
5491000	5493000	Program but it's not over yet guys
5493000	5495000	We got plenty more show to come
5495000	5497000	Your phone calls, your emails, rapid fire news
5497000	5499000	And the tweets on Twitter
5499000	5501000	Talk of Guitar Hero invading the Twitters
5501000	5503000	And Rock Band 3 information
5503000	5505000	And a new character confirmed for Marvel vs
5505000	5507000	Capcom 3 this week
5507000	5509000	We're gonna talk about all of that when we come right back with more
5509000	5511000	Of Orange Lounge Radio

5523000	5525000	September the 12th of 2010
5525000	5527000	We are live of course at All Games Radio
5527000	5529000	Where we do tape our show live every Sunday night
5529000	5531000	At 6 o'clock Pacific
5531000	5533000	9 o'clock Eastern right after
5533000	5535000	The Bobby Black Wolf show
5535000	5537000	Although next week he's not gonna be here
5537000	5539000	Sad
5539000	5541000	So it'll just be us next Sunday holding down the fort
5541000	5543000	But you know what that means
5543000	5545000	We can take over the stream early if we want
5545000	5547000	We can take over the stream early
5547000	5549000	And then go to bed early
5549000	5551000	Bobby assured me that there's no best of
5551000	5553000	Or anything next week so
5553000	5555000	And the chatters are requesting another marathon
5555000	5557000	Okay
5557000	5559000	No, are you crazy?
5559000	5561000	We're not doing another marathon
5561000	5563000	I'll go live early though
5563000	5565000	I'll go live early
5565000	5567000	You can do a marathon, you can broadcast all day long
5567000	5569000	And then I'll come in at 6 o'clock
5569000	5571000	As will Loki
5571000	5573000	Alan may be here next week I'm not sure
5573000	5575000	Okay
5575000	5577000	Coming in right in the middle of the rebirth
5577000	5579000	Of Pump Up the Volume
5581000	5583000	Good times
5583000	5585000	Maybe
5585000	5587000	On our Twitter
5587000	5589000	Run my dear
5589000	5591000	They're already asking for an OLR-thon too
5591000	5593000	Too much
5593000	5595000	If you do it too much then it loses its effect
5595000	5597000	It needs to stay like a once a year type of thing
5597000	5599000	Of course then again this show as it is
5599000	5601000	Has already been going what 8 and a half years
5601000	5603000	So if we even make it another year that in itself
5603000	5605000	Is something to celebrate so that'll be good
5605000	5607000	Think we'll make it to 10 years? That's a long time
5607000	5609000	That'll be good Why not?
5609000	5611000	It's only 2 more years
5611000	5613000	Not even 2 more whole years
5613000	5615000	We might make it to 10 years
5615000	5617000	You have coffee?
5617000	5619000	Nescafe do you want some? Is it decaf?
5619000	5621000	Yes
5621000	5623000	It's good Alright I'll try some
5623000	5625000	Fine I don't have any creamer to put in
5625000	5627000	Except for rice milk
5627000	5629000	I don't know if I have any left
5629000	5631000	Sure why not if you're offering
5631000	5633000	Woot I'm getting coffee
5633000	5635000	And you're getting rapid fire news
5635000	5637000	Quick stories that uh
5637000	5639000	We didn't fit anywhere else in the show
5639000	5641000	Loki
5641000	5643000	Walmart has a listing for an eco
5643000	5645000	Shadow of the Colossus
5645000	5647000	Kind of a
5647000	5649000	Classic I don't know if you call it
5649000	5651000	Rema HD compilation
5651000	5653000	That's gonna be on the Playstation 3
5653000	5655000	Um
5655000	5657000	I could see that happening
5657000	5659000	And I doubt that they would make up stuff so
5659000	5661000	It's possible
5661000	5663000	I bet we'd see it come out around the same time
5663000	5665000	As The Last Guardian so um
5665000	5667000	They may be jumping the gun
5667000	5669000	A little bit though
5669000	5671000	But at least that's on there right now
5671000	5673000	Other news
5673000	5675000	There is rumors that Frank
5675000	5677000	West may be in
5677000	5679000	Dead Rising 2 as well
5679000	5681000	And this is coming from the
5681000	5683000	Kind of a teaser site
5683000	5685000	I guess it's a little bit viral
5685000	5687000	Called tape it or die
5687000	5689000	Um
5689000	5691000	Where apparently they have uh
5691000	5693000	Some fictional characters Johnny Pipes
5693000	5695000	Uh recounts seeing someone
5695000	5697000	else fighting by green side
5697000	5699000	So I go after him he says
5699000	5701000	Um but then I see some other dude
5701000	5703000	Uh vaguely recognized him
5703000	5705000	Maybe saw him at a party a few years back
5705000	5707000	Maybe a celebrity can't remember his name though
5707000	5709000	Phil Floyd regardless
5709000	5711000	He was fighting zombies
5711000	5713000	Um too it was like Oktoberfest
5713000	5715000	But replaced the beer with zombies
5715000	5717000	And drinking with slaughter
5717000	5719000	It was like I died and gone to heaven
5719000	5721000	Um
5721000	5723000	And of course I believe in one of the
5723000	5725000	Screenshots where they have these like
5725000	5727000	Photos or whatever um
5727000	5729000	I thought I saw Frank West actually in there
5729000	5731000	Yes he is actually in that
5731000	5733000	Photo so
5733000	5735000	I think it's inevitable he has to make a cameo
5735000	5737000	Somewhere in the game you know what I mean
5737000	5739000	Like he's gotta be in it or people are just gonna be
5739000	5741000	Pissed
5741000	5743000	And also there's two player co-op
5743000	5745000	Oh they haven't said what the second player is?
5745000	5747000	Nope
5747000	5749000	In the demos it's been just you played another
5749000	5751000	Chuck Green but
5751000	5753000	Perhaps Frank West
5753000	5755000	Perhaps they'll charge you 500 points as DLC
5755000	5757000	Perhaps they will have like a second
5757000	5759000	The second quest
5759000	5761000	As you like to put it
5761000	5763000	Where you can play as Frank West
5765000	5767000	I think more games need
5767000	5769000	Second quests
5769000	5771000	Like the original Legend of Zelda
5771000	5773000	Wow that's a hot cup
5773000	5775000	Um
5775000	5777000	Console modder Ben Heck
5777000	5779000	Is getting his own show starting
5779000	5781000	September 13th
5781000	5783000	You may remember him from
5783000	5785000	Such wonderful console mods
5785000	5787000	As the Atari 2600
5787000	5789000	Portable
5789000	5791000	And all the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3
5791000	5793000	Laptops he's made
5793000	5795000	He does a lot of modding for different
5795000	5797000	Game controllers and what not
5797000	5799000	But he will have his own show
5799000	5801000	Appear on apparently
5801000	5803000	An internet TV channel called
5803000	5805000	Revision 3
5805000	5807000	And I guess
5807000	5809000	The one that does all the dig shows
5809000	5811000	Maybe and it's also
5811000	5813000	Gonna be hosted on Element 14
5813000	5815000	So
5815000	5817000	It's interesting
5817000	5819000	Will it be on actual television?
5819000	5821000	Don't know, should though
5821000	5823000	It'll be on Apple TV
5823000	5825000	That's where it'll be
5825000	5829000	Did the cat poop again?
5831000	5833000	DarkSakura just found a surprise
5835000	5837000	Aw poor thing
5837000	5839000	Any other quick stories
5839000	5841000	Loki, or should I move on here
5841000	5843000	Ah that's all I have
5843000	5845000	How about something about Final Fantasy
5845000	5847000	Dissida, you know a lot of you guys are really big fans of this game
5847000	5849000	It was pretty cool little
5849000	5851000	Final Fantasy fighting game
5851000	5853000	Well they've just announced
5853000	5855000	Dissida Duodecim
5855000	5857000	I guess is how you pronounce this
5857000	5859000	It's all Latiney words
5859000	5861000	Yes it is in the issue of Shonen Jump
5861000	5863000	Which is one of those magazines overseas
5863000	5865000	It's a sequel to Dissida Final Fantasy
5865000	5867000	It'll be coming out on Japanese PSPs
5867000	5869000	In 2011
5869000	5871000	Dissida Duodecim Final Fantasy
5871000	5873000	We don't know any new characters yet
5873000	5875000	Except for Final Fantasy 4's
5875000	5877000	Kane and Final Fantasy 13's
5877000	5879000	Lightning
5879000	5881000	That'll be cool, no other players have been confirmed
5881000	5883000	Yet, but I imagine most of the roster
5883000	5885000	From the first Dissida game
5885000	5887000	I know a lot of my friends are big fans of this game
5887000	5889000	So I'm sure they're going to be excited about that
5889000	5891000	More news on that when we know it
5891000	5893000	Meanwhile, for you Mac gamers
5893000	5895000	And I know there are some of you
5895000	5897000	You missed out on Grand Theft Auto 3
5897000	5899000	When it was the shit

5901000	5903000	Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas
5903000	5905000	A big pack of games is coming out later this year
5905000	5907000	That is confirmed from Rockstar's
5907000	5909000	Facebook for the Mac
5909000	5911000	I don't have a date yet or anything like that
5911000	5913000	But for you Mac gamers who missed out on that
5913000	5915000	I'm sure you're excited
5915000	5917000	And I know Dark Soccer is going to be first in line
5917000	5919000	For one of these on September 21st
5919000	5921000	For the low low price of $54.99
5921000	5923000	A pink
5923000	5925000	DualShock 3
5925000	5927000	Yay!
5927000	5929000	How do you like that?
5929000	5931000	I think I like cleaning up Shermie's poop better
5931000	5933000	Actually, I'll tell you something really cool
5933000	5935000	Let's listen to another podcast
5935000	5937000	I'm terrible because I forgot the name
5937000	5939000	And the gamer Edie's on, I like her
5939000	5941000	She's a friend of the show
5941000	5943000	GameHounds, that's what it's called
5943000	5945000	I was listening to her show and she was interviewing the guys that made the Tron game
5945000	5947000	At PAX because she was up at Penny Arcade Expo
5947000	5949000	Where all the cool kids were except for us
5949000	5951000	There is a Tron Playstation 3 controller coming out
5951000	5953000	That glows blue
5953000	5955000	And the minute I heard that I'm like, want
5955000	5957000	Need, must have
5957000	5959000	There's something other than that coming out
5959000	5961000	Something I covered for Geek Life, plug plug plug
5961000	5963000	Geek-Life.com
5963000	5965000	The collector's edition with the bike?
5965000	5967000	There's a keyboard and mouse coming out
5967000	5969000	That has the blue lighting on it
5969000	5971000	And the mouse is like one of those super nice
5971000	5973000	Cushioned, ergonomic
5973000	5975000	Really happy mice
5975000	5977000	I am such a consumer whore because I want all of it
5977000	5979000	I really do, I want the little PS3 controller
5979000	5981000	I want the keyboard, I want the mouse
5981000	5983000	I want the collector's edition of the game
5983000	5985000	I'm sad
5985000	5987000	If anyone wants to read about it you can go to
5987000	5989000	Geek-Life.com and look up my Geek Cube article
5989000	5991000	From a couple weeks ago
5991000	5993000	The shameless plug alarm
5993000	5995000	Is going off
5995000	5997000	It's all good
5997000	5999000	I will have to go read about that right now
5999000	6001000	While Dark Soccer
6001000	6003000	Does some other stories
6003000	6005000	Ruining my fun, Rob
6005000	6007000	Well
6007000	6009000	And this is actually really cool
6009000	6011000	We were talking about this not too long ago
6011000	6013000	Borderlands
6013000	6015000	Is getting a free update that will raise
6015000	6017000	The level cap and rebalance the game
6017000	6019000	Oooh
6019000	6021000	And it's of course across all the platforms
6021000	6023000	Xbox 360, PS3, PC
6023000	6025000	And this was announced
6025000	6027000	At PAX by the way
6027000	6029000	And the download content pack is called
6029000	6031000	Claptrap's New Robot Revolution
6031000	6033000	And
6033000	6035000	It's
6035000	6037000	It's going to be, I think, pretty good
6037000	6039000	There were some issues
6039000	6041000	With, you know, the way the game played
6041000	6043000	I thought, I mean otherwise it was still really fun
6043000	6045000	And also
6047000	6049000	They just said it was
6049000	6051000	Going to be the level cap at
6053000	6055000	69
6055000	6057000	That's funny
6057000	6059000	It's going to be out
6059000	6061000	It'll be released around October 12th
6061000	6063000	When the Game of the Year edition comes out
6063000	6065000	Kuma JP in chat just said the Xbox
6065000	6067000	Is getting one of those Tron controllers too
6067000	6069000	Damn it! That's another thing I'm going to have to buy now
6069000	6071000	Shit
6071000	6073000	And then
6073000	6075000	For next week's Rock Band download content
6075000	6077000	We've got some new stuff
6077000	6079000	We have Holy Diver by Dio
6079000	6081000	We have Stand Up and Shout by Dio
6081000	6083000	We have Nirvana
6083000	6085000	Juliana Hatfield
6085000	6087000	I haven't heard any of her stuff in a long time
6087000	6089000	Wow, she's still around making music?
6089000	6091000	I haven't heard her since like college
6091000	6093000	I think this is an older one
6093000	6095000	Irish Blood English Heart by Morrissey
6095000	6097000	I love Morrissey too
6097000	6099000	This is totally like my
6099000	6101000	College music
6101000	6103000	This is music snob week, like it really is
6103000	6105000	These are all the like, my music is better than yours
6105000	6107000	Artists
6107000	6109000	Straight Lines by Silverchair
6109000	6111000	That's another group I listened to when I was like first going to college
6111000	6113000	This Charming Man
6113000	6115000	That was like the one male anorexic that we've ever heard of
6115000	6117000	Was the guy in Silverchair
6117000	6119000	This Charming Man by the Smiths
6119000	6121000	It's also like Morrissey week
6121000	6123000	And Writing on the Walls
6123000	6125000	Under Oath
6125000	6127000	Okay, I might have to get some points
6127000	6129000	The list looks pretty awesome to me
6129000	6131000	Which of course
6131000	6133000	They're going to be
6133000	6135000	Now, the dollar amount is really all the same for them
6135000	6137000	But the Morrissey
6137000	6139000	The one that's
6139000	6141000	Irish Heart English Blood
6141000	6143000	This Charming Man and Writing on Walls are going to be
6143000	6145000	160 Microsoft points each
6145000	6147000	While the others are 200
6147000	6149000	Wii points
6149000	6151000	They're all going to be on
6151000	6153000	All the platforms, so
6153000	6155000	And then, last but not least
6155000	6157000	This is kind of funny, I think
6157000	6159000	Is that they're putting out
6159000	6161000	A
6161000	6163000	Wiimote
6163000	6165000	That's going to be coinciding
6165000	6167000	With the Wii title
6167000	6169000	Doctor Who Return to Earth
6169000	6171000	It's getting a Sonic Screwdriver
6171000	6173000	Wii controller, and I think that's awesome
6173000	6175000	It's of course based after
6175000	6177000	The current 11th Doctor's
6177000	6179000	Sonic Screwdriver
6179000	6181000	Which, honestly, I still think
6181000	6183000	That the best Sonic Screwdriver was
6183000	6185000	10th, but that's me
6185000	6187000	But it's also going to
6187000	6189000	Have the voices of Matt Smith
6189000	6191000	Who's currently playing the Doctor
6191000	6193000	And his lovely Redhead companion
6193000	6195000	It's going to be pretty cool
6195000	6197000	I might have to
6197000	6199000	To get that, I hope it comes out over here
6199000	6201000	It better
6201000	6203000	It very well might
6203000	6205000	You never know
6205000	6207000	By the way, just
6207000	6209000	Completely random before we get into the Twitter topic
6209000	6211000	Since DarkSakura brought up Rockband
6211000	6213000	I know a friend of mine would be very upset
6213000	6215000	If I did not mention UmLoud
6215000	6217000	Is officially announced for this year
6217000	6219000	This is the Rockband charity night
6219000	6221000	You play Rockband on stage
6221000	6223000	You pay money to do it, but it's this whole charity thing
6223000	6225000	It's pretty awesome
6225000	6227000	December 9th, the date has officially been announced this year
6227000	6229000	They switched days, if I'm not mistaken
6229000	6231000	It's not on the same night of the week
6231000	6233000	I think last year it was on a Monday
6233000	6235000	And this year it's going to be on a Thursday
6235000	6237000	So it's moving up
6237000	6239000	And apparently one of the big things they're doing this year
6239000	6241000	There's going to be a headliner band
6241000	6243000	That they're going to auction away
6243000	6245000	That's pretty cool
6245000	6247000	They're just going to sing Lady Gaga
6247000	6249000	And we'll call ourselves Victoria and the Gays
6249000	6251000	I'm really excited about that
6251000	6253000	So you might have to come out and watch us rock it
6253000	6255000	At UmLoud, but they do an internet stream too
6255000	6257000	Which I want to say was very well trafficked last year
6257000	6259000	And you can donate to a good cause
6259000	6261000	It's all for child's play, etc, etc
6261000	6263000	I will make sure Se gets on the show to talk about this
6263000	6265000	At some point
6265000	6267000	If he doesn't come on I will be sad
6267000	6269000	Moving on, let's get to some Twitter topics
6269000	6271000	Some tweets
6271000	6273000	The Twitters
6273000	6275000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
6275000	6277000	If you want to send us some tweets
6277000	6279000	Oops, I just closed them
6279000	6281000	Because I'm a genius
6281000	6283000	I was on the Twitter page
6283000	6285000	And my fat finger clicked the button
6285000	6287000	And I moved to a new page
6287000	6289000	And now Twitter is giving me the fail whale
6289000	6291000	That's great
6291000	6293000	Oh, here we go
6293000	6295000	Sbhail is asking
6295000	6297000	Was going to ask what you guys thought about the Sony move
6297000	6299000	But Rob's Twit pic already answered my question
6299000	6301000	I didn't post a picture of me holding the
6301000	6303000	Move controllers in a productive manner
6303000	6305000	Or anything
6305000	6307000	Well let me rephrase the question for Loki
6307000	6309000	Because he already talked about the Sony move earlier in the show
6309000	6311000	If you could sum up the Sony move in three words
6311000	6313000	Loki, what would they be?
6313000	6315000	Just like Nintendo
6315000	6317000	Nice
6317000	6319000	Let's see
6319000	6321000	Tigerclaw is giving us some links tonight
6321000	6323000	Steam is launching
6323000	6325000	A beta for the Steam wallet
6325000	6327000	Payment option
6327000	6329000	Apparently this is something they're beta testing
6329000	6331000	Instead of using a debit
6331000	6333000	Or credit card
6333000	6335000	You can actually use money out of your card
6335000	6337000	And put it in a Steam wallet
6337000	6339000	And then use the money to buy the game
6339000	6341000	Not sure how this works
6341000	6343000	Or why this is practical
6343000	6345000	I'm assuming it's some type of middle thing
6345000	6347000	Where your parents, when you're good
6347000	6349000	Will put $25 in your Steam wallet
6349000	6351000	And then you as the child
6351000	6353000	Can spend that on whatever
6353000	6355000	I'm thinking that's what this is
6355000	6357000	It's kind of like a fancy gift certificate
6357000	6359000	I guess very soon
6359000	6361000	It's being beta tested right now
6361000	6363000	Also from Tigerclaw
6363000	6365000	Because I'm nice and allowing two tweets tonight
6365000	6367000	The Xbox Live murderer
6367000	6369000	Was sentenced to two life sentences
6369000	6371000	Oh the sad thing is
6371000	6373000	I look at this and I go
6373000	6375000	Which Xbox Live murderer?
6375000	6377000	Because unfortunately there's been a lot of them
6377000	6379000	Well a jury convicted
6379000	6381000	Let's see, what's the name of the asshole in this case?
6381000	6383000	23 year old
6383000	6385000	Derek Lee Hernandez
6385000	6387000	Two mandatory life sentences
6387000	6389000	Congratulations, no parole
6389000	6391000	He killed 22 year old
6391000	6393000	Jason Holly
6393000	6395000	And it was a jury of six men and six women
6395000	6397000	Who deliberated over two days
6397000	6399000	Found him guilty
6399000	6401000	Oh man
6401000	6403000	I'm not even going to go into the gritty details
6403000	6405000	About this
6405000	6407000	Oh this was the guy, he was mentally challenged
6407000	6409000	And the guy
6409000	6411000	Kind of took advantage of him
6411000	6413000	Remember this? This was the judge
6413000	6415000	He wanted to be your friend Mr. Hernandez
6415000	6417000	He would have done whatever you asked him
6417000	6419000	And you took advantage of that
6419000	6421000	You tricked him into coming up to the mountains
6421000	6423000	And there was no other reason than to take his life
6423000	6425000	And yeah it was all this whole like
6425000	6427000	That he
6427000	6429000	Took the 360
6429000	6431000	From the poor guy
6431000	6433000	It's messed up
6433000	6435000	But it really has nothing to do with games
6435000	6437000	Again I hate these senseless murder things
6437000	6439000	Alright
6439000	6441000	Moving on, moving on, moving on
6441000	6443000	Blue Swim
6443000	6445000	Sending us a tweet
6445000	6447000	What are your biggest gaming surprises
6447000	6449000	And disappointments of the current console
6449000	6451000	Generation? Great job on the marathon show
6451000	6453000	Loved it
6453000	6455000	Biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation
6455000	6457000	From Blue Swim
6457000	6459000	Anyone?
6459000	6461000	I would say biggest surprise would be
6461000	6463000	LittleBigPlanet in a way
6463000	6465000	I didn't think I'd like that as much as I did
6465000	6467000	Biggest disappointment
6467000	6469000	Is probably
6469000	6471000	The Xbox Live game shows
6471000	6473000	1 vs 100
6473000	6475000	Going away so quickly
6475000	6477000	And without replacement
6477000	6479000	Anyone?
6479000	6481000	Uh
6481000	6483000	Hmm
6483000	6485000	I don't really
6485000	6487000	Have any major surprises
6487000	6489000	Or anything I mean really I mean LittleBigPlanet
6489000	6491000	I kind of expected it to do big
6491000	6493000	Um
6493000	6495000	I guess I'm kind of surprised about Final Fantasy 14
6495000	6497000	Sucking so bad
6497000	6499000	So I guess that's a disappointment
6499000	6501000	Loki anything?
6501000	6503000	Um
6503000	6505000	Let's see I would say
6505000	6507000	Disappointing would be
6507000	6509000	Nintendo and them grasping
6509000	6511000	Online because
6511000	6513000	They really haven't and I know that they have
6513000	6515000	They have stuff in their store in fact
6515000	6517000	I think the question is
6517000	6519000	We should be posing is
6519000	6521000	When's the last time that we've actually had a
6521000	6523000	Virtual console release from them?
6523000	6525000	Oh oh
6525000	6527000	No disappointment I know the biggest disappointment
6527000	6529000	PlayStation Home
6529000	6531000	So much potential just down the toilet
6531000	6533000	And to bounce off of that
6533000	6535000	Um
6535000	6537000	I would have to say probably
6537000	6539000	Um
6539000	6541000	Was it Microsoft's wonderful
6541000	6543000	Arcade thing
6543000	6545000	Game room Game room yeah
6545000	6547000	Uh
6547000	6549000	ActDeft in chat says
6549000	6551000	The greatest surprise was Earth Defense
6551000	6553000	Force
6553000	6555000	Which funny enough leads into Blue Swim's
6555000	6557000	Other tweets
6557000	6559000	Loki might recognize where Blue Swim's from in a minute here
6559000	6561000	And he says also
6561000	6563000	If I got Loki or OLR in hot water with
6563000	6565000	D3 publisher for the EDF story on CheapAssGamer
6565000	6567000	I apologize
6567000	6569000	Just wanted to share the EDF news and hopefully
6569000	6571000	Send some new listeners OLR's way in the process
6571000	6573000	Nah I know you didn't hear anything and you didn't
6573000	6575000	Send any listeners our way because no one realized
6575000	6577000	That you know it was from Orange Island
6577000	6579000	But your blog got a lot of hits
6579000	6581000	It was CheapAssGamer was the source of that story
6581000	6583000	Yeah because clearly they talked about it
6583000	6585000	On their show
6587000	6589000	No we don't blame you Blue Swim
6589000	6591000	Oh I know you're just excited
6591000	6593000	Like Loki is about the game
6593000	6595000	Remember I did add
6595000	6597000	A little something though
6597000	6599000	Remember it's not just 360
6599000	6601000	This time
6603000	6605000	Uh let's see
6605000	6607000	DarkKisuke sends us a tweet saying
6607000	6609000	You guys should play Dead Space for a show
6609000	6611000	Maybe the next marathon show
6611000	6613000	We don't usually play a lot of games on air while we're trying to do the show
6613000	6615000	It's a little bit distracting
6615000	6617000	For entertainment
6617000	6619000	This question might be inappropriate
6619000	6621000	So ready the inappropriate alarm
6621000	6623000	DarkSakura could you ready the inappropriate alarm?
6623000	6625000	Alright
6625000	6627000	Cause this question's for you for entertainment
6627000	6629000	Does DarkSakura have a vibrator
6629000	6631000	To compare the PS3 dildo sticks to?
6631000	6633000	Dildo sticks too
6639000	6641000	No
6641000	6643000	I had to think about it
6643000	6645000	I had to think about it I don't think anything I have
6645000	6647000	Her vibrators are uncomparable
6649000	6651000	No mine aren't USB
6651000	6653000	Spazinator PSN
6653000	6655000	Oh this is a good question
6655000	6657000	I totally forgot about this one
6657000	6659000	Senses tweet feel like touching on the whole
6659000	6661000	contemporary banning from Xbox Live
6661000	6663000	Because some guy lived in Fort Gay
6663000	6665000	West Virginia
6665000	6667000	Please tell me you guys heard about this
6667000	6669000	The guy put in his bio that he lived in Fort Gay
6669000	6671000	West Virginia
6671000	6673000	He got banned from Xbox Live
6673000	6675000	I thought though that they were stopping
6675000	6677000	They weren't banning people from that stuff nowadays
6677000	6679000	I think
6679000	6681000	When it was looked at
6681000	6683000	Some people thought
6683000	6685000	That he was calling West Virginia
6685000	6687000	Gay or something
6687000	6689000	It's not gay it's Fort Gay
6689000	6691000	There is
6691000	6693000	It is a maximum security
6693000	6695000	Gay facility
6695000	6697000	Coincidentally is going to be the name of the OLR Fort
6697000	6699000	That DarkSakura is going to take over someday
6699000	6701000	Fort Gay
6701000	6703000	Fort Gay?
6703000	6705000	Because it means happy
6705000	6707000	And we'll paint it rainbow
6707000	6709000	Because everyone loves a rainbow
6709000	6711000	Especially a double rainbow
6711000	6713000	What does it mean?
6713000	6715000	I thought the fortress of sodomy
6715000	6717000	That's next door
6717000	6719000	Alright
6719000	6721000	Obviously they're wearing egg
6721000	6723000	On their face over the whole thing
6723000	6725000	It's an excellent
6725000	6727000	Case of the corporate
6727000	6729000	Web and how the corporate
6729000	6731000	Web allowed that thing to spiral
6731000	6733000	Way out of control because you know
6733000	6735000	There were rules that were set and this guy
6735000	6737000	Is saying hey I
6737000	6739000	Live there, google it
6739000	6741000	It's a real place
6741000	6743000	For you and me that's where it should have ended
6743000	6745000	But unfortunately thanks to corporate
6745000	6747000	Webs it didn't end there and caused
6747000	6749000	A nightmare so now Microsoft
6749000	6751000	Is going to have to look at their
6751000	6753000	Corporate policy
6753000	6755000	To make sure this kind of dumb shit doesn't happen
6755000	6757000	Again
6757000	6759000	And Tigerclaw is saying
6759000	6761000	That Microsoft better be careful because
6761000	6763000	There is actually someone who lives in fucking
6763000	6765000	Australia
6765000	6767000	Isn't there a
6767000	6769000	France or something
6769000	6771000	I think there is another town called fucking
6771000	6773000	Fucking Australia
6773000	6775000	Oh no it's Austria not Australia
6775000	6777000	That's what I get when I read too fast
6777000	6779000	Fucking Austria
6779000	6781000	Sorry Australia
6781000	6783000	Readest town ever
6783000	6785000	That's what I say when I realize
6785000	6787000	Arnold Schwarzenegger really is the governor
6787000	6789000	Fucking Austria, alright no just kidding
6789000	6791000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding
6791000	6793000	AlphaCananagram is sending us a tweet
6793000	6795000	ChooChooRocket is coming back
6795000	6797000	That's kind of cool
6797000	6799000	ChooChooRocket is on its way out on the iPhone
6799000	6801000	It's going to be out in October
6801000	6803000	It might be coming to
6803000	6805000	Xbox Live and Playstation Network
6805000	6807000	We don't know but it might be
6807000	6809000	Apparently it needs enough support on
6809000	6811000	Facebook, it's a big Facebook
6811000	6813000	Trend thing
6813000	6815000	Let's see DJ Rama S appeals court
6815000	6817000	Ruling threatens used
6817000	6819000	Software sales, uh oh
6819000	6821000	That can't be good
6821000	6823000	He sends us a link here to this news
6823000	6825000	Let's see
6825000	6827000	A federal appeals court has sided with the computer software
6827000	6829000	In its effort to squelch sales of second hand programs
6829000	6831000	Covered by widely used licensing
6831000	6833000	Agreements
6833000	6835000	Let's see I'm looking here
6835000	6837000	A doctrine refers to a 102 year old decision
6837000	6839000	By the US Supreme Court that determined copyright holders
6839000	6841000	Can't prevent a buyer from
6841000	6843000	Reselling or renting a product after an initial
6843000	6845000	Sale as long as additional copies
6845000	6847000	Aren't made
6847000	6849000	A three judge panel in the 9th district
6849000	6851000	Concluded that first
6851000	6853000	Sale doctrine didn't apply to used
6853000	6855000	Software programs that online merchant
6855000	6857000	Timothy Verner peddled in his
6857000	6859000	Store on Ebay
6859000	6861000	Oh this might not be good
6861000	6863000	I have to read up more on this later
6863000	6865000	I haven't seen this covered on a lot of sites
6865000	6867000	Well
6867000	6869000	We'll see what the legal mumbo jumbo
6869000	6871000	Is as it comes to this
6871000	6873000	This is just like the first of many
6873000	6875000	Things
6875000	6877000	Alright
6877000	6879000	And SSJ100Matt on twitter is saying
6879000	6881000	Comedy site zug.com pulled a real life
6881000	6883000	Lemmings prank in downtown
6883000	6885000	Boston oh this has got to be interesting
6885000	6887000	Is this like a little video or something
6887000	6889000	Wow they actually dressed up in what looks
6889000	6891000	Like blue snuggies and green wigs
6893000	6895000	This is like one of those like stupid flash mob
6895000	6897000	Things I'm looking at the thing on youtube
6897000	6899000	Yep so there they go
6899000	6901000	They're walking into the water and falling in
6903000	6905000	This is the dumbest thing I've ever
6905000	6907000	Seen in my life
6909000	6911000	I love how there's all these college kids in the back
6911000	6913000	That like don't even care
6916000	6918000	Some people have too much time on their hands
6918000	6920000	But I love the look I love the snuggies as outfits
6920000	6922000	And lastly
6922000	6924000	Marin Marvel on twitter is saying
6924000	6926000	I'm totally guest hosting on OLR on October 1st
6926000	6928000	When Sky is out of town
6928000	6930000	You should it'll be fun
6930000	6932000	Actually you shouldn't you should come to Disneyland
6932000	6934000	With me you know Disneyland is better than this show
6934000	6936000	Sorry just saying
6936000	6938000	Just saying
6938000	6940000	That's it for the tweeters tonight
6940000	6942000	OLR
6942000	6944000	Back to gaming news Loki
6944000	6946000	Ah yes so speaking
6946000	6948000	Of tweets
6948000	6950000	This is retarded but
6950000	6952000	I guess the natural progression of
6952000	6954000	Stuff
6954000	6956000	Guitar Hero Warriors
6956000	6958000	Rock will be the first
6958000	6960000	Guitar Hero game
6960000	6962000	I can't see this with any less
6962000	6964000	Enthusiasm to integrate
6964000	6966000	Twitter and Facebook
6966000	6968000	Hurrah
6968000	6970000	Everybody can know when you do
6970000	6972000	Stuff in this game
6972000	6974000	Like I give a shit
6974000	6976000	But yes
6976000	6978000	It will be coming is confirmed on the Wii
6978000	6980000	I can tell you right now
6980000	6982000	Based off the presentation that was given to me
6982000	6984000	By the Activision reps
6984000	6986000	It is also coming to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
6986000	6988000	Which is not a big surprise
6988000	6990000	Um
6990000	6992000	Yes and apparently they've also
6992000	6994000	Incorporated a Wii award system
6994000	6996000	So when you do specific challenges in the game
6996000	6998000	You get credited for an award
6998000	7000000	And then you can share those online
7000000	7002000	With your friends
7002000	7004000	And if you share those online with your friends
7004000	7006000	They're gonna block you
7006000	7008000	That's right
7008000	7010000	Now my steam is working
7010000	7012000	So
7012000	7014000	Hurrah
7014000	7016000	And guess what though at least you know
7016000	7018000	Well you already know this but I mean if you
7018000	7020000	Buy guitar hero early you get a CD
7020000	7022000	Of like
7022000	7024000	Actual songs that are included in the game
7024000	7026000	Soundgarden's new album
7026000	7028000	Interesting tactic
7028000	7030000	If you like Soundgarden I guess
7030000	7032000	Yeah I'll be blocking that on Facebook
7032000	7034000	Pretty quickly no offense
7034000	7036000	Not really my thing
7036000	7038000	Hey but there's more details on Rock Band 3
7038000	7040000	I'm excited about this
7040000	7042000	No Twitter or Facebook integration here
7042000	7044000	Actually they are confirming that you will be
7044000	7046000	Able to export Rock Band 2 tracks
7046000	7048000	For a fee
7048000	7050000	The export feature will work on all three
7050000	7052000	Consoles of course there's always a couple
7052000	7054000	Of songs that get a little weird
7054000	7056000	So you can imagine that a couple songs
7056000	7058000	Are gonna fall off the list unfortunately
7058000	7060000	But most of them should come over for a small fee
7060000	7062000	That's really cool
7062000	7064000	Regular download content will remain the regular
7064000	7066000	Price that's $2 per song but
7066000	7068000	They are saying that for Rock Band 3's
7068000	7070000	Pro mode
7070000	7072000	The songs will probably be more expensive
7072000	7074000	Because there's more work that has to be done on
7074000	7076000	These tracks and they don't want to increase
7076000	7078000	The cost of regular download content
7078000	7080000	To subsidize the pro download content
7080000	7082000	That's aimed at a smaller group of players
7082000	7084000	Usually I'd be a little worried about this
7084000	7086000	But I go you know what I feel like
7086000	7088000	Harmonix kind of does the download content
7088000	7090000	Better than almost anyone right now so I'm like
7090000	7092000	Okay I trust them
7092000	7094000	Like I don't know how you guys feel but I'm just kind of like okay
7094000	7096000	If that's what they say I trust them
7096000	7098000	They get it
7098000	7100000	They've proved that they understand download content for a very long time
7100000	7102000	This export feature is great
7102000	7104000	You know yeah it's a fee but
7104000	7106000	I understand it's out of their hands and it's licensing
7106000	7108000	At least they bother to do it at all
7108000	7110000	I kind of go okay they know what they're doing
7110000	7112000	If that's what they say then I agree
7114000	7116000	Plus it also makes sense that the Rock Band
7116000	7118000	Stuff would cost a little more
7118000	7120000	In the pro mode because there's probably less people
7120000	7122000	Buying them too you know
7122000	7124000	Yeah I mean you have to have the pro mode instruments
7124000	7126000	And stuff like that which are really expensive
7126000	7128000	Well at least on the guitar
7128000	7130000	It's really expensive but
7130000	7132000	You know the keyboard's not so much
7132000	7134000	I don't know
7134000	7136000	I wouldn't want to pay extra for that stuff
7136000	7138000	But if you really want to
7138000	7140000	There's a market for it
7140000	7142000	I'm interested in the pro mode stuff
7142000	7144000	Especially for keyboards
7144000	7146000	Because once you learn how to like play the song
7146000	7148000	On a keyboard you could actually go to like a piano
7148000	7150000	Or whatever and play it I think that's awesome
7150000	7152000	If you can memorize it so
7152000	7154000	I'm looking forward to trying that out
7154000	7156000	That's going to be very cool
7156000	7158000	So we're going to go over to Dark Sakura
7158000	7160000	Who's got another story for us here
7160000	7162000	I sure do
7162000	7164000	Coming up very soon the mailbag
7164000	7166000	From Marvel versus Capcom the FUs of the week
7166000	7168000	And your calls
7168000	7170000	Well we've got a new challenger in
7170000	7172000	For Marvel versus Capcom 3
7172000	7174000	And this is
7174000	7176000	Pretty pretty sweet
7176000	7178000	But we're getting Tron Bonn
7178000	7180000	That's so cool
7180000	7182000	She's kind of on crack
7182000	7184000	She's kind of been in like
7184000	7186000	A lot of the fighting games right
7186000	7188000	Give us the new Mega Man Legends already
7188000	7190000	I hate you
7190000	7192000	Servbots have been in the background
7192000	7194000	In Capcom, they're so cute
7194000	7196000	They look like Lego Men
7196000	7198000	Yeah I agree though, where's Mega Man Legends
7198000	7200000	There is coming but it's
7200000	7202000	It's just going to take forever
7202000	7204000	I would buy that on PS1 Classics if I could
7204000	7206000	Is that available? I don't think it is
7206000	7208000	For PS1 Classics
7208000	7210000	Damn you Capcom
7210000	7212000	Just when you're doing so many things right
7212000	7214000	There's that one thing
7214000	7216000	One thing
7216000	7218000	You know with
7218000	7220000	Let's say that the
7220000	7222000	Homebrew scene or pirating scene
7222000	7224000	However you want to call it
7224000	7226000	Gets to where it is on the PSP
7226000	7228000	They have ways to convert
7228000	7230000	PS1 ISO files into
7230000	7232000	A playable format on the
7232000	7234000	PlayStation emulator that's on the
7234000	7236000	PSP so you can port
7236000	7238000	Mega Man Legends or something like that
7238000	7240000	If they can do it for the PSP
7240000	7242000	They may be able to do it for the PS3
7242000	7244000	Very nice
7244000	7246000	Or I could just find the PS1 disc somewhere and play it
7246000	7248000	My PS3
7248000	7250000	Is that hard to find?
7250000	7252000	No they're not
7252000	7254000	I don't remember the game being particularly rare
7254000	7256000	I could be wrong but
7256000	7258000	Yeah
7258000	7260000	Anyhow speaking of Mega Man Loki right?
7260000	7262000	Yes speaking of Mega Man
7262000	7264000	There's some new details coming out
7264000	7266000	About Mega Man Universe
7266000	7268000	And it's kind of cool
7268000	7270000	The game itself looks a little bit like
7270000	7272000	It could be similar to the Mega Man
7272000	7274000	Powered up Mega Man
7274000	7276000	Which was on the PSP
7276000	7278000	It showed a level editor
7278000	7280000	That's awesome
7280000	7282000	That you'll be able to share of course
7282000	7284000	With your friends
7284000	7286000	Different levels that you've made
7286000	7288000	It's Little Big Mega Man
7288000	7290000	Isn't that what this game is turning into?
7290000	7292000	It seriously is getting pretty awesome
7292000	7294000	And they had some other screenshots
7294000	7296000	That showed
7296000	7298000	Different playable characters
7298000	7300000	They had a screenshot that actually showed
7300000	7302000	The box art Mega Man plane
7302000	7304000	Also you can create
7304000	7306000	New Mega Man characters by
7306000	7308000	Mixing and matching different parts
7308000	7310000	Like different heads and what not
7312000	7314000	Really cool stuff and also I guess
7314000	7316000	They're saying that
7316000	7318000	Of course there's going to be the
7318000	7320000	Ryu Mega Man that's in there
7320000	7322000	Probably the ghosts and goblins Mega Man
7324000	7326000	Mega Men
7326000	7328000	Mega Men yes
7328000	7330000	In fact here's the screenshot there of
7330000	7332000	The box art one which
7332000	7334000	Is so ugly
7334000	7336000	Well you know this isn't the first time that Mega Man's had
7336000	7338000	Street Fighter moves
7338000	7340000	Because remember in X2
7340000	7342000	He could get the Hadoken and Shoryuken
7342000	7344000	If you did the special
7344000	7346000	Level thing
7346000	7348000	Which I could do
7348000	7350000	But the game itself though
7350000	7352000	I'm kind of rusty when it comes to
7352000	7354000	Identifying my Mega Man stages
7354000	7356000	But I'm wondering if it's going to have
7356000	7358000	More than just
7358000	7360000	It looks like Mega Man
7360000	7362000	2 characters
7362000	7364000	It looks very Mega Man 2 inspired
7364000	7366000	Doesn't it? I'm wondering if it's going to have more than that
7366000	7368000	That might be cool. Alpha Cananagram
7368000	7370000	In the chat is quick to correct me on things
7370000	7372000	He says Mega Man powered up with
7372000	7374000	The level editor came out 2 years before
7374000	7376000	Little Big Planet
7376000	7378000	True enough I suppose but I don't know
7378000	7380000	I kind of feel like Little Big Planet's
7380000	7382000	Really made the splash you know what I mean I don't know
7382000	7384000	Yeah
7384000	7386000	But ok sure so this idea is
7386000	7388000	Not entirely new for the Mega Man series
7388000	7392000	Well I know I'm interested in the game
7392000	7394000	I'm going to buy it. Is it arcade or is it retail?
7394000	7396000	Have they said? Arcade
7396000	7398000	Oh man that's going to be a heck of an arcade game
7398000	7400000	Hopefully it's not more than
7400000	7402000	20 bucks but watch them be charging like 30
7402000	7406000	If there's going to be a game that's going to break the price barrier
7406000	7408000	Yet again it'll be this. Watch
7408000	7410000	We'll see though
7410000	7412000	Hopefully not
7412000	7414000	If they do try to break the barrier
7414000	7416000	It might leave Valve to talk even more smack
7416000	7418000	About Xbox Live. Oh you haven't heard
7418000	7420000	Valve has apparently talked some smack
7420000	7422000	About Xbox Live
7422000	7424000	This is kind of interesting because I seem to recall
7424000	7426000	Some time ago it was just the reverse
7426000	7428000	They used to dog on Playstation 3
7428000	7430000	And they were supporting Xbox Live
7430000	7432000	With exclusives such as Portal still alive
7432000	7434000	Well times have changed a little bit
7434000	7436000	Haven't they?
7436000	7438000	Gabe Newell has referred to Xbox Live as a
7438000	7440000	Train Wreck
7440000	7442000	Quote, we thought that there would be something that would emerge
7442000	7444000	Because we figured it was sort of untenable
7444000	7446000	Oh yeah we understand that these are the rules now
7446000	7448000	But it's such a train wreck that something
7448000	7450000	Will have to change
7450000	7452000	That's why we're really happy with the current situation with the Playstation 3
7452000	7454000	We're solving it now in a way that is going to work
7454000	7456000	For our customers rather than assuming
7456000	7458000	Something is going to emerge later
7458000	7460000	That will allow us to fix this
7460000	7462000	Yikes
7462000	7464000	They're saying that Microsoft has got to change the
7464000	7466000	Online policies if they want to compete
7466000	7468000	You know I want to say though not the first person
7468000	7470000	To dog a little bit on Xbox Live
7470000	7472000	This kind of reminds me of Square Enix
7472000	7474000	Coming out a little bit ago saying that
7474000	7476000	Final Fantasy 14 is not coming out on the
7476000	7478000	Xbox 360 because Xbox Live
7478000	7480000	Just ain't going to work
7482000	7484000	That's what they're saying
7484000	7486000	Very interesting
7486000	7488000	Yeah
7488000	7490000	It's interesting to me
7490000	7492000	Kind of how Valve has come full circle
7492000	7494000	I mean and I can see the reasons
7494000	7496000	Why to an extent
7496000	7498000	And certainly again not the first developer
7498000	7500000	To say bad things about
7500000	7502000	Xbox Live but it's just very interesting
7502000	7504000	How much things have changed in a few years
7504000	7506000	There you go
7506000	7508000	Let's get to the mail bag
7508000	7510000	Shall we? Dark Soccer you ready to rip open the email
7510000	7512000	Bag and read some emails for us here?
7512000	7514000	I'm ready to rip something
7520000	7522000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
7522000	7524000	If you want to send us any emails to be read on the
7524000	7526000	Air. Did we get some emails? The mailbag was pretty
7526000	7528000	Thin going into tonight's show. Did we get some?
7528000	7530000	We got a few
7530000	7532000	The first one's from awesomedude slash troy
7536000	7538000	Now this is the philosophical question I gave us some
7538000	7540000	Warning
7540000	7542000	Even though my emails might be getting monotonous
7542000	7544000	From the consistency of pointless ones
7544000	7546000	This question actually has meaning
7546000	7548000	Now I have had this brewing
7548000	7550000	In my head for a couple of days
7550000	7552000	And I'm afraid I might not be able to do it
7552000	7554000	Either before well I leave this
7554000	7556000	Dying ball of life we call Earth
7556000	7558000	Yeah I just tried to make that sound cool
7558000	7560000	If you had to choose changing
7560000	7562000	The world and leaving your mark on it or
7562000	7564000	Living your life with a loved one which one would you choose?
7564000	7566000	You know what I would choose?
7566000	7568000	I don't see why you can't do both
7568000	7570000	Jeez
7570000	7572000	I know it's tricky because what's going to
7572000	7574000	Prevent me from doing one over the other it's
7574000	7576000	Strange um
7576000	7578000	What if by being with somebody you leave your mark
7578000	7580000	On the world? I kind of feel like
7580000	7582000	Okay this is going to sound really cheesy but I feel
7582000	7584000	Like in a way this show has left the mark
7584000	7586000	On the world a little bit
7586000	7588000	Like maybe not in a totally like
7588000	7590000	Amazing humanitarian
7590000	7592000	Mother Teresa kind of way
7592000	7594000	But just some of the really nice
7594000	7596000	Emails that I've got over the years
7596000	7598000	Especially from like you know other
7598000	7600000	Guys who sometimes struggle
7600000	7602000	With oops not the FU music yet
7602000	7604000	Um sometimes other guys who've like struggled
7604000	7606000	With coming out and stuff and saying that like
7606000	7608000	Hearing me on the show has helped with that like the power
7608000	7610000	Of an email like that is like
7610000	7612000	Really hard to put into words
7612000	7614000	And just like in how that makes you feel
7614000	7616000	Like you've really had an impact and I know
7616000	7618000	You know there's there's quote unquote fans
7618000	7620000	Of all of us out there which is such a strange
7620000	7622000	Feeling because we're pretty normal
7622000	7624000	People we just like video games and
7624000	7626000	Figured out how to do this radio thing pretty
7626000	7628000	Quickly and have stayed pretty dedicated to it
7628000	7630000	Um that those kind of words have been amazing
7630000	7632000	So I kind of feel like in some ways
7632000	7634000	I've already picked the first option
7634000	7636000	Because I'm not living with a loved
7636000	7638000	One right now the dark soccer is
7638000	7640000	Doing both yeah so
7640000	7642000	It's tough because you're asking me to backtrack
7642000	7644000	I don't know I don't see
7644000	7646000	Why you can't do both I mean what's the
7646000	7648000	They're not mutually exclusive
7648000	7650000	Plus if you live with a loved
7650000	7652000	One aren't you leaving your mark
7652000	7654000	On the world
7654000	7656000	With that relationship I know that sounds
7656000	7658000	So weird but a little bit my philosophy
7658000	7660000	Is that the best way to change the world
7660000	7662000	And leave your mark is to be an active
7662000	7664000	Part of making it better
7664000	7666000	To
7666000	7668000	Not be a dick to people
7668000	7670000	You know
7670000	7672000	To
7672000	7674000	You know if you've got the extra time
7674000	7676000	And you're just sitting on your butt
7676000	7678000	You know go volunteer or something
7678000	7680000	There's nothing to say that you can't do
7680000	7682000	Both just love people
7682000	7684000	And it doesn't mean I don't mean like sex
7684000	7686000	I don't mean like love like kissy
7686000	7688000	Kissy I just mean like there's all different types
7688000	7690000	Of love there's platonic love there's
7690000	7692000	Family love brotherly love
7692000	7694000	You know there is romantic love there's
7694000	7696000	Love for earth I don't mean
7696000	7698000	To sound like a hippie or whatever but
7698000	7700000	I think that's kind of what a lot of it's about
7700000	7702000	Isn't it? You've nailed it on the head
7702000	7704000	Just
7704000	7706000	Don't love people
7706000	7708000	People get all butt hurt over their own political
7708000	7710000	You know points of view being
7710000	7712000	Hey everyone's gotta believe what I do
7712000	7714000	Man
7714000	7716000	But you know if everyone was exactly the same
7716000	7718000	It would be boring
7718000	7720000	And we would stagnate
7720000	7722000	It's those differences that put a challenge
7722000	7724000	We would be the Borg
7724000	7726000	I am a firm believer that people don't
7726000	7728000	Grow without a challenge
7728000	7730000	That you have to have that challenge for people to overcome
7730000	7732000	And if they don't overcome those are the people who don't
7732000	7734000	Get to do anything in the world
7734000	7736000	You know they're just gonna
7738000	7740000	I have a hard time putting this
7740000	7742000	Because some people are content to live their life
7742000	7744000	Just being themselves
7744000	7746000	You know not doing anything
7746000	7748000	But I think that the best
7748000	7750000	Way to grow and challenge
7750000	7752000	Yourself is to
7752000	7754000	Move outside your comfort zone
7754000	7756000	To do something that's gonna make it better
7756000	7758000	Because nothing changes until you make a change
7758000	7760000	Well
7760000	7762000	That has nothing to do with games
7762000	7764000	That was a very deep email for this program
7764000	7766000	But hey sorry to dodge your question
7766000	7768000	But hope you got out of it
7768000	7770000	Loki didn't say anything
7770000	7772000	Eh
7772000	7774000	There I said something
7774000	7776000	Oh Loki
7776000	7778000	Next email
7778000	7780000	Hi OLR crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act
7780000	7782000	I wanted to tell you that you did a pretty damn
7782000	7784000	Good job with the marathon on Sunday
7784000	7786000	Slash Monday I wish I could have been
7786000	7788000	There while this was live but I
7788000	7790000	Did catch the podcast
7790000	7792000	Is this
7792000	7794000	You about many interesting topics
7794000	7796000	Like favorite game and soundtracks
7796000	7798000	I guess it's you spoke about many interesting
7798000	7800000	Topics like favorite game and soundtracks
7800000	7802000	And other stuff since I wasn't there to participate in
7802000	7804000	The chat room I would like to participate to
7804000	7806000	That with this email
7806000	7808000	My favorite game and probably my favorite
7808000	7810000	Soundtrack of all time is Kirby Superstar
7810000	7812000	So many different games to choose
7812000	7814000	From and they're pretty detailed with puzzles
7814000	7816000	And pretty good platforming
7816000	7818000	Actdeft likes Kirby you don't say
7818000	7820000	I didn't know I hadn't heard
7820000	7822000	Hey No it's funny that's cool
7822000	7824000	And the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing
7824000	7826000	And probably since then
7826000	7828000	It has made me so interested in video music
7828000	7830000	Like I am now
7830000	7832000	Video game music sorry
7832000	7834000	I would really recommend people getting
7834000	7836000	Kirby Superstar Ultra on the DS
7836000	7838000	Make it worthy
7838000	7840000	Make it worthy of any DS game library
7840000	7842000	But not as all
7842000	7844000	Happy game wise
7844000	7846000	Excuse me
7846000	7848000	You also talked about disappointment
7848000	7850000	Mine was Final Fantasy 8
7850000	7852000	Got it for cheap but I still think I got robbed
7852000	7854000	Hey let me finish
7854000	7856000	Well I don't like Final Fantasy 7 either
7856000	7858000	At least in
7858000	7860000	At least decent in lots of things
7860000	7862000	Final Fantasy 8 really takes all the good things
7862000	7864000	Of the series and burns them to the ground
7864000	7866000	The card game is damn awful
7866000	7868000	I never played the card game for the record
7868000	7870000	And it doesn't give you a real good incentive
7870000	7872000	To play it kind of like Blitzball and Final Fantasy 10
7872000	7874000	Which I didn't really do either
7874000	7876000	But the thing I hate the most
7876000	7878000	About the whole damn game is the story
7878000	7880000	It sucks bad it's terra bad
7880000	7882000	I don't even like Final Fantasy 10
7882000	7884000	Pretty much for the same things
7884000	7886000	But I didn't buy it and even though the battle system
7886000	7888000	And grid system is kind of cool
7888000	7890000	Final Fantasy 8 really I don't give a crap about that game
7890000	7892000	See he doesn't like it for the wrong reasons
7892000	7894000	Cause I think the story was actually
7894000	7896000	It's strongest part it's the battles
7896000	7898000	That really did it in for me
7898000	7900000	But from what I play to the beta
7900000	7902000	14 very well might be worse than 8
7902000	7904000	Like I don't know yet
7904000	7906000	I guess I will have to play the retail version
7906000	7908000	At some point to give you my final thoughts
7908000	7910000	But there may be a new challenger
7910000	7912000	For the worst Final Fantasy game ever
7912000	7914000	Oh no the new challenger has appeared
7914000	7916000	I'll let you know
7916000	7918000	Oh well that's all for now I will talk about other stuff
7918000	7920000	You talked about next week
7920000	7922000	I don't want to send a big ass email
7922000	7924000	Too late no I'm kidding
7924000	7926000	Until next time
7926000	7928000	P.S. I still don't believe that Duke Nukem Forever will get released
7928000	7930000	We'll see
7932000	7934000	And I wonder if this one
7934000	7936000	I think it will now that it's with the new developer
7936000	7938000	I think that's what had to happen
7938000	7940000	It just needed to be taken by somebody else
7940000	7942000	It'll come out now
7942000	7944000	Next email
7944000	7946000	When you guys were young did you ever play a game
7946000	7948000	That was so horrible but there was something about it
7948000	7950000	That always kept you playing
7950000	7952000	One bad game that comes to mind is Banjo-Kazooie
7952000	7954000	I spent countless hours sitting in front of my parents TV screen
7954000	7956000	Trying to collect all those little
7956000	7958000	Glowing puzzle pieces
7958000	7960000	I wanted to punch the TV screen every time the crazy
7960000	7962000	Bear and bird spoke
7962000	7964000	However for some unknown reason I kept playing till I beat it
7964000	7966000	Today I cringe when I hear any song from that game
7966000	7968000	What about you guys?
7968000	7970000	Your fellow girl gamer Ziba
7970000	7972000	Clash at Demonhead
7972000	7974000	Totally
7974000	7976000	It's not that great a game really
7976000	7978000	It's definitely a guilty pleasure game
7978000	7980000	I used to love that game and I don't know why
7980000	7982000	As far as old school 8-bit NES games go
7984000	7986000	I really can't remember any
7986000	7988000	There's games that pissed me off that I'd keep playing
7988000	7990000	Like Puzzle and Desu
7990000	7992000	I'm sorry, you remember I covered that on Classic Game?
7992000	7994000	That game pisses me off so much
7994000	7998000	And it's really not even the best game ever
7998000	8000000	But the challenge is so hard to it
8000000	8002000	Ugh, that game pisses me off
8002000	8004000	What about you, Loki?
8008000	8010000	Earth Defense Force
8010000	8012000	It gets really challenging
8012000	8014000	Especially when you get on those inferno levels
8014000	8016000	Sometimes it makes me want to hurt somebody
8016000	8018000	And I just play more of it
8018000	8020000	Good call
8020000	8022000	Last email
8022000	8024000	No!
8024000	8026000	Hey, OLR, emailing in on a few things
8026000	8028000	That I wouldn't recommend
8028000	8032000	But I know I would forget, so here it goes
8032000	8034000	I know this news is two weeks late
8034000	8036000	But Sony not only has their dreaded online pass
8036000	8038000	On some sports games
8038000	8040000	But it's on an awesome PSP FPS
8040000	8042000	Called SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3
8042000	8044000	Also, this may be old news
8044000	8046000	But I've never heard this on the radio
8046000	8048000	Any radio which makes me laugh
8048000	8050000	Any of you heard of a game
8050000	8052000	Called Minecraft?
8052000	8054000	I've never heard of it
8054000	8056000	I've never heard of it
8056000	8058000	Any of you heard of a game called Minecraft?
8058000	8060000	Don't judge on graphics
8060000	8062000	Although you guys probably wouldn't
8062000	8064000	My way of describing it would be
8064000	8066000	Awesomesauce imagination orgasm
8066000	8068000	Okay
8068000	8070000	You have unlimited boundaries
8070000	8072000	North, south, east, and west
8072000	8074000	And you can go really far up and down
8074000	8076000	And it's only in alpha
8076000	8078000	Give it a try and decide whether or not to buy it
8078000	8080000	It's only 10 euros or about 13 bucks
8080000	8082000	And it entitles you to play future releases of the game
8082000	8084000	And he put the address
8084000	8086000	C-R-A-F-T dot net
8086000	8088000	Is he a co-producer or writer?
8088000	8090000	I don't know. I don't think so
8090000	8092000	Currently it has only one developer
8092000	8094000	But he's awesome
8094000	8096000	Here's the bullshit part
8096000	8098000	He's been making so much money from people paying for it
8098000	8100000	PayPal fucking froze his account
8100000	8102000	Due to a suspicious withdrawal or deposit
8102000	8104000	That's pretty funny
8104000	8106000	Um
8106000	8108000	I'm actually gonna look at this real quick
8108000	8110000	Cause I wouldn't
8110000	8112000	Hitstun in our chatroom says there's a lot of Minecraft
8112000	8114000	On Justin TV
8114000	8116000	It doesn't look that bad
8116000	8118000	It looks really, um
8118000	8120000	Super Nintendo-ish 3D
8120000	8122000	But yeah
8122000	8124000	Apparently he
8124000	8126000	It was over 600,000 euros
8126000	8128000	And then
8130000	8132000	PayPal is like trying to keep the money or something
8132000	8134000	That's weird
8134000	8136000	That's kinda screwed up
8136000	8138000	Anyway, gonna continue
8138000	8140000	Minecraft may seem odd
8140000	8142000	But it's great and freaking addictive
8142000	8144000	When you realize all the possible things you can do
8144000	8146000	Slash make
8146000	8148000	Um, well, I think that's enough for one email
8148000	8150000	But I'll chat slash call in if I have anything else of interest
8150000	8152000	That comes up
8152000	8154000	May the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless your souls
8154000	8156000	DarkCuseK AKA Butcher
8156000	8158000	Raw man
8158000	8160000	P.S. Gonna be super sad to not hear your voices next week
8160000	8162000	I guess he's not gonna be listening next week
8162000	8164000	Oh, oh
8164000	8166000	I forgot
8166000	8168000	He sent us a tweet that said disregard is P.S.
8168000	8170000	Oopsie
8170000	8172000	Whoops
8172000	8174000	Screwed up on that one
8174000	8176000	I think he might have us mixed up with Bobby Black Wolf
8176000	8178000	Cause Bobby's not live next week
8178000	8180000	Oh, YouTube
8180000	8182000	Alan sent me this YouTube
8182000	8184000	And if Alan sent it to me I have to look at it
8184000	8186000	He told me a little bit about what it is
8186000	8188000	And I'd heard of this
8188000	8190000	And it sounds kinda cool
8190000	8192000	Oh, it's like, uh, stop motion
8192000	8194000	All these people in colored shirts
8194000	8196000	Sitting in chairs
8196000	8198000	Doing Pac-Man
8198000	8200000	They do these in a movie theater
8200000	8202000	That's kind of rad
8204000	8206000	Can Alan link that in chat?
8206000	8208000	Please? Thank you
8208000	8210000	I like the little noise in the background
8210000	8212000	Let me turn that up a little bit
8212000	8214000	Doo doo doo doo doo
8224000	8226000	I love the noises more than anything
8226000	8228000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
8228000	8230000	Okay, anyway, this makes for terrible radio
8230000	8232000	People did a Space Invaders one
8232000	8234000	That takes a lot of work
8234000	8236000	Like, that took all day
8238000	8240000	God
8240000	8242000	College kids
8242000	8244000	Y'all had too much free time
8244000	8246000	It's a lot of its editing though
8246000	8248000	Because all they had to do was get one scene
8248000	8250000	Where everybody was sitting in the grid
8250000	8252000	In the beginning
8252000	8254000	And then just take one shot of that and keep superimposing
8254000	8256000	Where he's at
8256000	8258000	It does take a lot of effort
8258000	8260000	But it's not as much as
8260000	8262000	They used magic and witchcraft
8262000	8264000	Or they took one shot
8264000	8266000	Where he wasn't in each spot and just kept playing
8266000	8268000	Stop motion
8268000	8270000	They had to hold that camera
8270000	8272000	Real steady
8272000	8274000	Real steady
8274000	8276000	Hey, it's that time of the show where we get mad
8276000	8278000	The FUs of the Week
8294000	8296000	Um
8296000	8298000	My FU of the Week goes to, uh, Dan not being here
8298000	8300000	Well, I mean
8300000	8302000	And I understand it was important to go to see his family
8302000	8304000	But still
8304000	8306000	It doesn't really stop me from being very lonely
8306000	8308000	Because he's been
8308000	8310000	You know, while he's not working and I wasn't working
8310000	8312000	I was used to having him here all day
8312000	8314000	And it was really nice
8314000	8316000	And now he's not there
8316000	8318000	And also I have to go back into the office tomorrow
8318000	8320000	Because bitches didn't send me my, um
8320000	8322000	My letter about getting laid off
8322000	8324000	And I haven't been paid in two weeks
8324000	8326000	So you know what this means
8326000	8328000	If they don't fix it
8328000	8330000	I can collect interest
8330000	8332000	On my pay
8332000	8334000	And if they don't get anything to me
8334000	8336000	I'm going to the labor board
8336000	8338000	Alert the media
8338000	8340000	Well, I could talk to the media too
8340000	8342000	I don't know how far I want to get into this
8342000	8344000	But I was looking at work at the news
8344000	8346000	And the latest things
8346000	8348000	I saw your work on the
8348000	8350000	Local news media site
8350000	8352000	About the closure
8352000	8354000	And see, I never got any memo that says
8354000	8356000	Don't talk about it
8356000	8358000	I'm not under NDA
8358000	8360000	Oh
8360000	8362000	Uh, Loki
8362000	8364000	I had some that I was
8364000	8366000	Really pissed off about earlier
8366000	8368000	And I don't remember what it was
8368000	8370000	I'm going to go with my second
8370000	8372000	Thing that I'm pissed off at
8372000	8374000	And that would be Apple
8374000	8376000	And I'm pissed off at their customer service
8376000	8378000	It's good and terrible at the same time
8378000	8380000	The reps are nice
8380000	8382000	The just simple
8382000	8384000	Logic stuff just doesn't seem to
8384000	8386000	Apply to them. For example
8386000	8388000	I purchased two iPod Touches
8388000	8390000	From them using an Apple gift card
8390000	8392000	That I got from Sony
8392000	8394000	From my work for some sort of sales
8394000	8396000	Incentive thing
8396000	8398000	I purchased it on the third
8398000	8400000	And they
8400000	8402000	According to the site
8402000	8404000	When I ordered it, it said it was going to be shipped
8404000	8406000	This week
8406000	8408000	Instead this week, they changed it
8408000	8410000	And it's shipping next week
8410000	8412000	And you know
8412000	8414000	Meanwhile, the Apple store has tons of these
8414000	8416000	They have just a pile of them
8416000	8418000	Just sitting there
8418000	8420000	So I called them up multiple times going
8420000	8422000	I need to cancel my order
8422000	8424000	So that I can go purchase
8424000	8426000	Oh I'm sorry, even though we took off
8426000	8428000	The funds immediately out of your card
8428000	8430000	It's going to take us five to seven business days
8430000	8432000	To put it back on the card
8432000	8434000	Even though it's their own Apple card
8434000	8436000	I'm like, well okay fine, I don't really want to cancel
8436000	8438000	I just want to pick it up at the local store
8438000	8440000	Because they have them in stock
8440000	8442000	Oh no, I'm sorry you can't do that
8442000	8444000	Because our systems are separate
8444000	8446000	So that's retarded
8446000	8448000	It finally shipped though on Friday
8448000	8450000	FROM CANADA
8450000	8452000	Why the fuck are you shipping something
8452000	8454000	From Canada to the United States
8454000	8456000	I'm sure you have a fucking plant
8456000	8458000	In the US that you can ship these from
8458000	8460000	But no, let's pick a really far away
8460000	8462000	Place to ship it from
8462000	8464000	Just to piss me off even more
8464000	8466000	I wouldn't have these, that fucking gift card
8466000	8468000	I wouldn't be buying your stupid iPods
8468000	8470000	But I am
8470000	8472000	Like I'm fucking going to buy an ITV
8472000	8474000	Or an iMac, no way
8474000	8476000	We're part of Canada
8476000	8478000	I don't know
8478000	8480000	I'm not familiar with Canada
8480000	8482000	I can look that up real quick while you do your FUs
8482000	8484000	I will, my FU
8484000	8486000	Goes to myself
8486000	8488000	Because I've managed to put a scratch on my brand new car
8488000	8490000	After having it for only about
8490000	8492000	Two and a half months
8492000	8494000	I'm going to park
8494000	8496000	Don't worry, I didn't hit another car
8496000	8498000	Refrain from making fun of me
8498000	8500000	Because I will destroy you
8500000	8502000	I scratched the car parking in Alan's garage
8502000	8504000	Because
8504000	8506000	It's big city garages
8506000	8508000	And they're very tight fits
8508000	8510000	In the big cities
8510000	8512000	As opposed to what I'm used to dealing with in Sacramento
8512000	8514000	Where it's like giant four car garages
8514000	8516000	Yeah, I got a big old scratch in the car now
8516000	8518000	And I'm kind of upset about it
8518000	8520000	My mistake, it's not Canada
8520000	8522000	Even further away
8522000	8524000	Because there's no Shanghai, Canada
8524000	8526000	It's China
8526000	8528000	They're shipping it from China
8528000	8530000	Yeah, let's pick the furthest place
8530000	8532000	From my location to ship this from
8532000	8534000	That's probably where the damn thing's made
8534000	8536000	I like that, that's awesome
8536000	8538000	And by the way, because Apple's so wonderful
8538000	8540000	And you know, in saving their costs
8540000	8542000	They ship them separate
8542000	8544000	The two items are actually separate
8544000	8546000	Thank you
8546000	8548000	Thank you for doing all that wonderful stuff for me
8548000	8550000	Why are you mad though?
8553000	8555000	Hey, more news, happy happy
8555000	8557000	And then the Skype line's coming at you
8557000	8559000	1877 Game OLR, not just yet
8559000	8561000	I'll let you know when
8561000	8563000	Yes, um
8563000	8565000	So there's a brand new
8565000	8567000	Overclock remix album
8567000	8569000	That's coming out, you may remember the last one
8569000	8571000	Was a remix album from Final Fantasy 7
8571000	8573000	This time it's going to be
8573000	8576000	A five part Final Fantasy 5 compilation
8576000	8578000	Oh I get it
8578000	8580000	Five parts, because it's five
8580000	8582000	Ha
8582000	8584000	It's called the Final Fantasy 5
8584000	8586000	The Fabled Warriors
8586000	8588000	An overclocked remix five part album series
8588000	8590000	And um
8590000	8592000	It is free
8592000	8594000	Which is the best price
8594000	8596000	And the first part of the five
8596000	8598000	Is actually out now
8598000	8600000	So you can go check it out
8600000	8602000	And if you want to download that
8602000	8604000	Go to
8604000	8606000	wcremix.org
8608000	8610000	Alright
8612000	8614000	One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the
8614000	8616000	Skype line at 877 Game OLR
8616000	8618000	Our username on Skype
8618000	8620000	OrangeLoungeRadio
8620000	8622000	Being asked in chat from floppy discourse
8622000	8624000	What about Google Talk? Doesn't Google Talk let you call
8624000	8626000	877 numbers now?
8626000	8628000	Like you can call numbers in the US and Canada?
8628000	8630000	You can actually call numbers?
8630000	8632000	That's what I heard, yeah
8632000	8634000	I'll keep my phone with Google
8634000	8636000	Talk once I get
8636000	8638000	I was going to get a prepaid phone
8638000	8640000	Through like AT&T or something
8640000	8642000	Like that
8642000	8644000	But I don't like AT&T
8644000	8646000	Because they're like, oh by the way there's all these fees
8646000	8648000	We add on top of that
8648000	8650000	Because I only would use like 12 minutes a month
8650000	8652000	And I'd use their 25 cent
8652000	8654000	Per minute plan or something like that
8654000	8656000	But then they're like, oh we're going to add another dollar fee
8656000	8658000	On there, oh and there's taxes, oh and there's this
8658000	8662000	Oh and there's a convenience fee
8662000	8664000	So I'll just go through Virgin
8664000	8666000	Alright, one more story
8666000	8668000	For you guys, do you know the name
8668000	8670000	Chiaki Kuriyama?
8670000	8672000	I hope you do
8672000	8674000	Yeah I know the name
8674000	8676000	She was in Kill Bill
8676000	8678000	And she was in Battle Royale
8678000	8680000	Correct
8680000	8682000	She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill
8682000	8684000	And then she was
8684000	8686000	I don't remember the character's name
8686000	8688000	She was in Battle Royale
8688000	8690000	She was in both of those movies
8690000	8692000	She was
8692000	8694000	Not cock puncher
8694000	8696000	She will soon be taking the role of
8696000	8698000	Misuzu Asaki
8698000	8700000	It's going to be the heroine of the new
8700000	8702000	Yakuza game
8702000	8706000	That's right, it's Yakuza Ryugagotoku of the End
8706000	8708000	That's right, Sega revealed this week
8708000	8710000	To IGN the fact that she is in the game
8710000	8712000	There's going to be some images
8712000	8714000	Compared here where you can actually
8714000	8716000	See that the character in the game
8716000	8718000	Looks like her too, which is kind of freaky
8718000	8720000	She's a very pretty girl
8720000	8722000	And the character looks like her
8722000	8724000	Characters in other movies, very reminiscent
8724000	8726000	Of Gogo Yubari
8726000	8728000	So there it is, very cool
8728000	8730000	There's some other characters in the game as well
8730000	8732000	But no worry about who the voice actors are
8732000	8734000	There will be lots and lots and lots of more
8734000	8736000	Information at the Tokyo Game Show
8736000	8738000	This actress does not
8738000	8740000	Really act or speak in English
8740000	8742000	As far as I know
8742000	8744000	She doesn't play Japanese exclusive roles
8744000	8746000	So don't expect this voice acting to come over to the US
8746000	8748000	But for those of you guys that are really into
8748000	8750000	The Yakuza series, like I know
8750000	8752000	Deakman, who does our website, loves these games
8752000	8754000	Probably will import it on Playstation 3
8754000	8756000	Thanks to the region free stuff
8756000	8758000	Can look forward to hearing her lovely voice
8758000	8760000	As the heroine in that game
8760000	8762000	Very cool
8762000	8764000	Skypline is now open 1877 Game OLR
8764000	8766000	Or our username on Skype
8766000	8768000	Is OrangeLoungeRadio
8768000	8770000	We're already getting calls, you ready for this?
8770000	8772000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
8772000	8774000	Who's this?
8774000	8776000	Hey, this is DJ Blaziken
8776000	8778000	DJ Blaziken, what's on your mind?
8778000	8780000	Not much
8780000	8782000	Other than I got a little bit
8782000	8784000	Of a similar situation
8784000	8786000	That Loki kind of discussed
8786000	8788000	A while back
8788000	8790000	On an episode how he's
8790000	8792000	Trying to stray away from the three-fret
8792000	8794000	Formation
8794000	8796000	Because he was a converger
8796000	8798000	From guitar freaks to guitar hero
8798000	8800000	Well, let's just say here
8800000	8802000	I had the same excuse
8802000	8804000	When I started playing guitar hero
8804000	8806000	I'm like
8806000	8808000	I cannot play medium, there's four notes
8808000	8810000	There should only be three
8810000	8812000	Aw, it wasn't that hard
8812000	8814000	It wasn't that hard
8814000	8816000	All it takes is
8816000	8818000	Loki, one word
8818000	8820000	Practice
8820000	8822000	That's right, practice
8822000	8824000	Yeah, but that also takes time
8824000	8826000	And time I'm not willing to spend on that
8826000	8828000	Okay
8828000	8830000	I will say though, I recently
8830000	8832000	Downloaded and played the
8832000	8834000	DJ Hero 2 demo
8834000	8836000	Oh, I forgot that's out
8836000	8838000	I did half that
8838000	8840000	You know what, those bastards didn't put it on PlayStation Network
8840000	8842000	And my controller and gamer
8842000	8844000	For PlayStation Network
8844000	8846000	It's exclusive to Xbox 360
8846000	8848000	Because we're Activision
8848000	8850000	And we suck
8850000	8852000	Well, okay
8852000	8854000	I will say though, it is pretty cool
8854000	8856000	On the factor
8856000	8858000	Now they have the DJ battle mode
8858000	8860000	Which is basically
8860000	8862000	Okay, if you remember just
8862000	8864000	Normal space off in Guitar Hero
8864000	8866000	It's basically what this is for DJ Hero
8866000	8868000	It's cool it is
8868000	8870000	So, like, you do one part
8870000	8872000	And then your player does another part
8872000	8874000	And he goes back and forth
8874000	8876000	I'm still wondering though if they're gonna do
8876000	8878000	And I forgot to ask him when he was there
8878000	8880000	If they're gonna do the guitar here
8880000	8882000	Or the guitar DJ stuff again
8882000	8884000	I remember how they had that
8884000	8886000	By what I was seeing on the demo
8886000	8888000	There wasn't anything for guitar and DJ
8888000	8890000	It was mostly the vocals
8890000	8892000	And DJ stuff
8892000	8894000	And my father kind of found
8894000	8896000	It kind of weird that I was singing
8896000	8898000	The song, Don'tcha
8898000	8900000	The Doncha remix
8900000	8902000	And then the Lady Gaga remix
8902000	8904000	It would have been cool though
8904000	8906000	If they did that because they could have had vocals
8906000	8908000	And they could have had guitars
8908000	8910000	And then a DJ or something
8910000	8912000	Man, that would be great
8912000	8914000	For Loki to get that on YouTube
8914000	8916000	Doing a Doncha
8916000	8918000	You know what they really should have done
8918000	8920000	But I'm sure they don't want to affect their
8920000	8922000	DJ Hero sales
8922000	8924000	You know how Rock Band 3
8924000	8926000	Added keyboards have the next
8926000	8928000	Guitar Hero game add turntables
8928000	8930000	To the actual rock stuff
8932000	8934000	How many songs really support that though?
8934000	8936000	Not many, but it would be kind of neat though
8936000	8938000	As in a little added download content
8938000	8940000	How many songs support a guitar in DJ Hero?
8940000	8942000	Not a lot, but it was pretty cool
8942000	8944000	The ones that did
8944000	8946000	And actually, do you know what
8946000	8948000	Of all the weird things
8948000	8950000	You know how you guys were talking about
8950000	8952000	Learning the actual dance moves
8952000	8954000	From Dance Central and whatnot
8954000	8956000	Well, of all the weird things
8956000	8958000	One of my
8958000	8960000	One of my friends
8960000	8962000	Went to a Macy's store and actually
8962000	8964000	Went and tried out
8964000	8966000	A thing with Dance Central
8966000	8968000	And he showed me some of the moves
8968000	8970000	To Lady Gaga's Poker Face
8970000	8972000	And let's just say
8972000	8974000	Here
8974000	8976000	I think it was that or Just Dance that came on
8976000	8978000	At Homecoming
8978000	8980000	And we were actually pulling off
8980000	8982000	The actual dance moves from the music video
8982000	8984000	And
8984000	8986000	Let's just say here, we were
8986000	8988000	Getting questions asked, like
8988000	8990000	How do you know the moves from the video?
8990000	8992000	And you both got laid, right?
8992000	8994000	Huh?
8994000	8996000	Nothing
8996000	8998000	Basically, our answer was
8998000	9000000	We learned them from a video game
9000000	9002000	And people just gave us a weird eye
9002000	9004000	And it was the same thing
9004000	9006000	It was the same thing we were doing
9006000	9008000	Next time you need to say
9008000	9010000	Private lessons
9010000	9012000	Private lessons is your answer next time
9012000	9014000	You know, it's not
9014000	9016000	I mean, cause see a game like
9016000	9018000	Even Just Dance, actually
9018000	9020000	It's not, you know
9020000	9022000	It shows you dance moves
9022000	9024000	I would go repeating
9024000	9026000	What was in there. Okay, let me play this way, Rob
9026000	9028000	And this is just gonna make you want YouTube videos
9028000	9030000	Of this even more
9030000	9032000	I had, I picked some songs
9032000	9034000	To play, you know, like I did
9034000	9036000	Junior Seniors
9036000	9038000	Move Your Feet, that was fun
9038000	9040000	Um
9040000	9042000	Wait, in Dance Central? No, not Dance Central
9042000	9044000	In Just Dance 2
9044000	9046000	I know that song
9046000	9048000	From DDR Extreme back on the Playstation 2
9048000	9050000	Which, that was the last
9050000	9052000	Good one
9052000	9054000	That was one of our first songs retired from the
9054000	9056000	Cage match because the video was so awesome
9056000	9058000	It is awesome
9058000	9060000	Um, there's a song on there, I don't remember which
9060000	9062000	Artist it is, but they have like a Tron guy
9062000	9064000	Dancing in the background of
9064000	9066000	Just Dance 2, but anyways
9066000	9068000	As I was gonna say, I got to pick some songs
9068000	9070000	And then the Ubisoft ref, she got to pick
9070000	9072000	Some songs, and unfortunately she picked
9072000	9074000	It's Raining Men
9074000	9076000	So there is a video out there of me
9076000	9078000	Trying to beat her
9078000	9080000	At, you know, I was
9080000	9082000	Trying to be more fabulous than she was
9082000	9084000	I guess, at that
9084000	9086000	But I got close, I did not beat
9086000	9088000	Her though at that song, and thank god
9088000	9090000	Because that would have been the only song that I actually beat her in
9090000	9092000	And that would not be good either
9092000	9094000	Sorry, I just need to hear a little bit of this song here
9104000	9106000	This song is pretty amazing
9106000	9108000	Too bad this band never really went anywhere
9108000	9110000	But this song
9110000	9112000	Hey, um, by the way
9112000	9114000	Uh, on the factor, okay
9114000	9116000	I figured out a way to sort of
9116000	9118000	Try to play Guitar Hero Rock Band
9118000	9120000	And, um, what else
9120000	9122000	Rock Revolution
9122000	9124000	To make the guitar point like guitar freaks
9124000	9126000	In other words, all I've had to do
9126000	9128000	Is flip my miniature
9128000	9130000	Monitor like it's a 9 incher monitor
9130000	9132000	Upside down
9132000	9134000	Flip it to lefty mode
9134000	9136000	And
9136000	9138000	That's how I've been able to make it play like guitar freaks almost
9138000	9140000	That is a lot of effort
9140000	9142000	For such a little reward
9142000	9144000	But hey, whatever makes you happy, dude
9144000	9146000	Alright
9146000	9148000	We gotta let you go to get some more calls, dude
9148000	9150000	I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off
9150000	9152000	Because we gotta get some more calls
9152000	9154000	But thank you so much
9154000	9156000	Hurry it up
9156000	9158000	We actually did some DDR moves
9158000	9160000	To, I think it was, um
9160000	9162000	My Sharona
9162000	9164000	Let's just say here, one or two
9164000	9166000	Guys who said they might have heard your show
9166000	9168000	Back in the day
9168000	9170000	We should have been on Step Squad years ago
9170000	9172000	Since you've been at DDR tournaments
9174000	9176000	We've been watching a bunch of Mel B dance
9176000	9178000	Videos from tournaments
9178000	9180000	Ah, alright
9180000	9182000	Well, next time take an orange bat
9182000	9184000	To prom, that's all I'm saying
9184000	9186000	If you really want to represent the show
9186000	9188000	Later
9188000	9190000	1-877-GAME-OL-R
9190000	9192000	If you wanna give us a call
9192000	9194000	Or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype
9194000	9196000	If you wanna give us a call that way, like this person is
9196000	9198000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
9198000	9200000	Hey, it's Ronma, what's up everyone
9200000	9202000	Hey, Ronma, what's up?
9202000	9204000	Not much, um
9204000	9206000	To answer what you said about the Texas Instrument calculators
9206000	9208000	Yeah, they're still making them
9208000	9210000	And multiple models and flavors
9210000	9212000	I just would have thought that, like
9212000	9214000	They were on, like, model, like
9214000	9216000	90-100 by now, you know what I mean?
9216000	9218000	Like, instead of 82
9218000	9220000	Well, my roommate has a TI-85
9220000	9222000	But they don't make that one anymore
9222000	9224000	From what I remember
9224000	9226000	This is from, like, a few months ago
9226000	9228000	They still make the 83, the 84
9228000	9230000	84 Plus
9230000	9232000	84 Plus Silver, the 89
9232000	9234000	And one called the Nspire
9234000	9236000	One size a scientific calculator
9236000	9238000	You pull the keyboard out and you flip it over
9238000	9240000	It's like a mini computer
9240000	9242000	That sounds like a sidekick or something, that's crazy
9242000	9244000	And yeah, that thing's like
9244000	9246000	200 bucks, and around this time
9246000	9248000	In the year, the parents come in
9248000	9250000	With the, um, with the list of
9250000	9252000	Stuff that the kids need, and if they're taking
9252000	9254000	Entry-level algebra math
9254000	9256000	They're told that they need a
9256000	9258000	TI calculator
9258000	9260000	Now, who remembers the TI-99-4A?
9260000	9262000	Anyone remember that?
9262000	9264000	I had that
9264000	9266000	That was a computer in the 1980s, the TI-99
9266000	9268000	I had that
9268000	9270000	With the big cartridge thing on the side
9270000	9272000	Oh yeah, the big ol' cartridge slot that went on the side
9272000	9274000	I have played so many games on that
9274000	9276000	There's something that I need to find
9276000	9278000	You want to get a TI-99
9278000	9280000	Just for the heck of it?
9280000	9282000	Just so you can play, like, Texas Invaders
9282000	9284000	Wow
9284000	9286000	Would that be Mexicans?
9286000	9288000	No, it's a
9288000	9290000	Space Invaders rip-off
9290000	9292000	You dingbat
9292000	9294000	Alright, I'm sorry, that'd be Arizona Invaders
9294000	9296000	Stop it
9296000	9298000	Alright
9298000	9300000	Well, thank you for the
9300000	9302000	Update on calculators
9302000	9304000	Glory to tell
9304000	9306000	Alright, make it quick
9306000	9308000	I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
9308000	9310000	A couple of weeks ago
9310000	9312000	And I was checking my scores on the leaderboards
9312000	9314000	And I'm going to post a link in the chatroom
9314000	9316000	Of a Twitpig, because this makes for great radio
9316000	9318000	Now, the funny thing is
9318000	9320000	If you look at it, I'm ranked
9320000	9322000	Above someone called
9322000	9324000	I'm a greedy Jew
9324000	9326000	And I found it
9326000	9328000	Slightly offensive
9328000	9330000	So someone's game tag is I'm a greedy Jew
9330000	9332000	Just to be fair, though, you're two slots
9332000	9334000	Above I'm a greedy Jew, actually
9334000	9336000	Two slots, yeah
9336000	9338000	You're under
9338000	9340000	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you're five slots
9340000	9342000	Under Yapathy
9344000	9346000	I just find it
9346000	9348000	Funny that when I first got Rock Band
9348000	9350000	I went and I created my band
9350000	9352000	Which was my roommate's idea, which was called
9352000	9354000	Rhythm in Jews
9354000	9356000	When I put it in, it said
9356000	9358000	And I quote
9358000	9360000	Jews are banned on Xbox Live
9360000	9362000	I think that was
9362000	9364000	A programming issue
9364000	9366000	I had to go and change the
9366000	9368000	E to a 3
9368000	9370000	Way so I can get on and play
9370000	9372000	Well
9372000	9374000	Did you report the name for being offensive?
9374000	9376000	Because I'm thinking, you know, call
9376000	9378000	Me crazy, but if Mount
9378000	9380000	Gay or whatever, no, Fort Gay
9380000	9382000	West Virginia is going to get banned
9382000	9384000	I have a feeling I'm a greedy
9384000	9386000	Jew might be
9386000	9388000	Slightly offensive, and I don't think that's
9388000	9390000	A town in, like, South Carolina or
9390000	9392000	Anything, I'm pretty sure that guy's just
9392000	9394000	A douchebag
9394000	9396000	And I've seen a couple more names like that, so I popped
9396000	9398000	In Rock Band 2, flipped the
9398000	9400000	3 back to an E, and I had
9400000	9402000	No problem going on live
9404000	9406000	Whatever makes you happy
9406000	9408000	I'm just amused by it, that's all
9408000	9410000	It just amuses
9410000	9412000	Me, that's all it is
9412000	9414000	Alright, well I have to
9414000	9416000	Now that we have one sitting in studio
9416000	9418000	I have to ask the official Jew of Orange Lawn
9418000	9420000	Radio Dark Sakura, are you offended by the
9420000	9422000	Name I'm a Greedy Jew
9422000	9424000	On Xbox Live?
9424000	9426000	I don't really
9426000	9428000	Get offended, I think, by other people, really
9428000	9430000	Because they're the ones who are stupid and
9430000	9432000	Ignorant, and I'm not
9432000	9434000	However, he could very likely
9434000	9436000	Just admit all the, you know
9436000	9438000	Perhaps he
9438000	9440000	Admits that he's Jewish
9440000	9442000	And happens to be a bit greedy
9442000	9444000	That could be
9444000	9446000	Maybe it's really SSJ-100 Matt
9446000	9448000	However
9448000	9450000	You called him into the show just to make that
9450000	9452000	Joke, didn't you?
9452000	9454000	Kinda, sorta
9454000	9456000	However
9460000	9462000	I mean
9464000	9466000	I just have a hard time
9466000	9468000	About being offended by other people's
9468000	9470000	Ignorance
9470000	9472000	They're just, they're poop
9472000	9474000	They're being poopy
9474000	9476000	Why is that person worth my time?
9476000	9478000	You know
9478000	9480000	I think
9480000	9482000	It's a symptom
9482000	9484000	Of society
9484000	9486000	And it's not, I don't think
9486000	9488000	It's funny
9488000	9490000	I don't think it's funny at all
9490000	9492000	And I'm sure it is intended to be
9492000	9494000	Offensive
9494000	9496000	But I would rather just not give them
9496000	9498000	The satisfaction of being offended
9498000	9500000	That's me
9500000	9502000	Alright
9502000	9504000	Well, Rama, any other offensive things you wanna
9504000	9506000	Bring to the attention of our little program?
9506000	9508000	Baba Booey, Baba Booey
9508000	9510000	Howard Stern
9510000	9512000	Bye, Rama
9512000	9516000	1877 Game OLR
9516000	9518000	Or our username on Skype is
9518000	9520000	OrangeLoungeRadio if you care to venture that way
9520000	9522000	We're taking your calls
9522000	9524000	Live as we tape our show on this
9524000	9526000	Lovely Sunday evening
9526000	9528000	Hot and ready to go
9528000	9530000	What? No
9530000	9532000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
9532000	9534000	Clearly, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
9534000	9536000	Who's this?
9536000	9538000	Hey, can you guys hear me?
9538000	9540000	Yes we can, hi
9540000	9542000	Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill
9542000	9544000	DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?
9544000	9546000	Not that much
9546000	9548000	Two things, just real quick
9548000	9550000	That shows that hell is freezing over
9550000	9552000	First, I'm actually getting Halo Reach
9552000	9554000	Oh my gosh, Halo Reach around
9554000	9556000	For it?
9556000	9558000	Somewhat, only because it's the last game
9558000	9560000	In the series apparently
9560000	9562000	And I'm getting a $20 gift card from Best Buy
9562000	9564000	So why not?
9564000	9566000	Nice
9566000	9568000	Yeah, just pretty much all the reasons
9568000	9570000	I mean, I gotta multiplayer and end up cursing everybody out
9570000	9572000	As usual
9572000	9574000	But that's just the first sign
9574000	9576000	And the second sign which is very
9576000	9578000	I'm gonna ask everybody here for help is
9578000	9580000	I'm also getting a Playstation 3
9580000	9582000	By Christmas this year
9582000	9584000	And the thing is
9584000	9586000	The only really big condition is
9586000	9588000	I need to get more games that are not
9588000	9590000	That everybody can play
9590000	9592000	Not just myself
9592000	9594000	Like party games
9594000	9596000	You could say that
9596000	9598000	Games are not like
9598000	9600000	What about the Playstation move?
9600000	9602000	I mean, it's just gonna be a bunch of wee party
9602000	9604000	games on the move, any interest in that?
9604000	9606000	Well, actually that
9606000	9608000	Is the reason I'm getting it, first off
9608000	9610000	For the move
9610000	9612000	There you go right there
9612000	9614000	Yeah
9614000	9616000	I was just thinking
9616000	9618000	I was just thinking more games
9618000	9620000	Than just the move games
9620000	9622000	You know, something else
9622000	9624000	The SingStar franchise is always a good
9624000	9626000	Party starter, that's really popular at parties
9626000	9628000	Because it's like karaoke, one of the
9628000	9630000	Karaoke games, it's a little different from
9630000	9632000	Rock Band in those games because A, it's exclusively
9632000	9634000	Singing and lets you do duets and stuff
9634000	9636000	And B, it actually shows the actual music videos
9636000	9638000	In the background, which I think is kind of a nice
9638000	9640000	Touch, especially for people that aren't as familiar
9640000	9642000	With video games, it's like, suddenly you have a
9642000	9644000	Karaoke bar in your house, so that's all
9644000	9646000	Interesting, you know, in that regard, those are
9646000	9648000	Always fun games, what else?
9648000	9650000	Fun party games on the
9650000	9652000	Playstation 3 or multiplayer
9652000	9654000	Events, Little Big Planet
9654000	9656000	Absolutely, is a Playstation 3
9656000	9658000	Exclusive, up to four people can play that game
9658000	9660000	At once, online or in the same house
9660000	9662000	Modulation Racers, oh that's a good one too
9662000	9664000	That's a good one for multiplayer, can you
9664000	9666000	Do, does it have split screens, you can do that all?
9666000	9668000	I believe it does
9668000	9670000	Nice, very nice
9670000	9672000	What are the fun little party games?
9672000	9674000	Blur, I don't know
9674000	9676000	I'm trying to think of things that are exclusive
9676000	9678000	Because you said you had a 360, right?
9678000	9680000	There is Buzz
9680000	9682000	Oh, Buzz is
9682000	9684000	Very popular for parties, that's the game
9684000	9686000	Showy game, when it comes to the special
9686000	9688000	Controllers that are just like the A, B, C and D
9688000	9690000	Answers, and people who write their own
9690000	9692000	Questions and everything, that is a big
9692000	9694000	Big party game, for multiplayer
9694000	9696000	You can write in your own questions?
9696000	9698000	Yes you can, that's what I hear
9698000	9700000	Yeah, I know right
9700000	9702000	Apparently they, I don't
9702000	9704000	Know if you can straight up
9704000	9706000	Do your, I don't have the game personally, I don't know
9706000	9708000	If you can straight up do your own questions and play
9708000	9710000	A game locally with those questions you wrote
9710000	9712000	But I know like people are able to submit
9712000	9714000	Questions to like official question packs
9714000	9716000	And things, I've heard of this, I don't
9716000	9718000	Know, again I don't own the game myself
9718000	9720000	So I'm not sure of all the details and how it works
9720000	9722000	All my own questions? That'd be great
9722000	9724000	Like an OLR trivia pack
9724000	9726000	Would anyone play that? I don't know
9726000	9728000	Alright, so I guess those are our
9728000	9730000	Suggestions, so let us know what you end
9730000	9732000	Up buying and if you have fun with it
9732000	9734000	I definitely will guys
9734000	9736000	Alright, well have fun with PlayStation 3
9736000	9738000	Keep on gaming
9738000	9740000	And we'll talk to you later, okay?
9740000	9742000	Alright, be good guys
9742000	9744000	Later, we'll try
9744000	9746000	That's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
9746000	9748000	Sorry for those guys that didn't get through, but be sure to
9748000	9750000	Always leave us an email
9750000	9752000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com or
9752000	9754000	Our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR
9754000	9756000	And so forth
9756000	9758000	Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to tonight?
9758000	9760000	It's not a lot tonight
9760000	9762000	One is that there's a rumor
9762000	9764000	That the Nintendo DS, or not the DS
9764000	9766000	The 3DS will be out
9766000	9768000	In Japan in November
9768000	9770000	This is coming from a company called
9770000	9772000	Keys Factory
9772000	9774000	Yeah, Keys Factory, they design
9774000	9776000	A bunch of DS,
9776000	9778000	DSi, DSi, XL
9778000	9780000	Peripherals
9780000	9782000	And apparently this is coming from
9782000	9784000	Their Twitter
9784000	9786000	And it was saying that
9788000	9790000	Let's see here
9790000	9792000	It was saying November 20th is when they're expecting
9792000	9794000	The system out
9794000	9796000	So
9796000	9798000	That's interesting, it says on November 20th
9798000	9800000	11 3DS
9800000	9802000	Products that we designed to go on sale
9802000	9804000	All at once, people who are buying 3DS
9804000	9806000	Buy it at the same time
9806000	9808000	There'll be more details on our homepage
9808000	9810000	So
9810000	9812000	It's interesting, maybe they'll announce that
9812000	9814000	At Tokyo Game Show, since it's right around the corner
9814000	9816000	Actually no, I don't think
9816000	9818000	They actually are at Tokyo Game Show
9818000	9820000	Well, maybe around the same time
9820000	9822000	They usually do their own Nintendo thing
9822000	9824000	So that's that
9824000	9826000	And then Knights in the Nightmare
9826000	9828000	A game that was originally out on the Nintendo DS
9828000	9830000	From Atlus
9830000	9832000	It's coming to the PSP
9832000	9834000	And kind of as an added bonus
9834000	9836000	They are going to be giving you
9836000	9838000	A copy, a digital copy that is
9838000	9840000	Of, and I cannot
9840000	9842000	Pronounce this, but we're going to try
9842000	9844000	Looks like
9844000	9846000	Yggdras
9846000	9848000	Union, I guess
9848000	9850000	Y-G-G-D-R-A
9850000	9852000	And
9852000	9854000	That's going to be in every
9854000	9856000	Copy, every launch copy of
9856000	9858000	Knights in the Nightmare, but knowing
9858000	9860000	Atlus, that will be all the copies of
9860000	9862000	Knights in the Nightmare on PSP
9862000	9864000	They're scheduled to come out
9864000	9866000	November 9th
9866000	9868000	So that's kind of cool
9868000	9870000	And
9870000	9872000	That'd be it
9872000	9874000	Wow, this is kind of slow on the last minute
9874000	9876000	Yeah, it's pretty, pretty dead
9876000	9878000	Alright
9878000	9880000	Well, that's going to do it for this week's episode
9880000	9882000	Of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we get around
9882000	9884000	And get everybody's final thought
9884000	9886000	Uh, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?
9886000	9888000	Suebooks!
9888000	9890000	Can we please make that the fortune cookie message tonight?
9890000	9892000	I don't know what you had picked, but
9892000	9894000	Okay, okay, okay
9894000	9896000	Alright, thank you
9896000	9898000	Let me pick one once in a while
9898000	9900000	I had Lewis Black, so
9900000	9902000	We'll roll him over to next week, you won't mind
9902000	9904000	Alright
9904000	9906000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9906000	9908000	I don't catch that reference
9908000	9910000	You will soon
9910000	9912000	Is that it for your final
9912000	9914000	I don't get it
9914000	9916000	Hopefully I'll have a connect in
9916000	9918000	Two weeks
9918000	9920000	Alright
9920000	9922000	Cross my fingers
9922000	9924000	My final thought is
9924000	9926000	I don't know
9926000	9928000	Hi, that's my final thought
9928000	9930000	I don't know
