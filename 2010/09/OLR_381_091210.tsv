14282	19184	Tonight, September 12, 2010, the Need for Speed MMO is set to go free.
19524	21985	Could digital distribution soon come to arcades?
22405	25266	And the next Guitar Hero game is set to invade your Twitter.
31792	36415	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36495	42239	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, all of it.
42279	44540	We're the place where every gamer has a voice.
44981	51705	And leading the charge over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52045	52886	Om nom noms.
52966	53566	Om nom nom.
53606	53967	How are you?
54607	55247	Om nom nom.
55448	57229	Orange Lounge Foodio going on over there.
57809	58870	I slept most of the day.
59290	59530	Awesome.
59610	60711	Orange Lounge Nappio.
63953	66074	I took an awesome nap yesterday, actually.
66174	67555	And that's how I was able to stay up late.
67595	68776	Because I went clubbing.
69196	70817	And I was able to stay up until like 2 a.m.
70837	71277	It was fun.
71417	72558	It sounds like you had a good time.
72858	73699	I had a great time.
73779	77741	I'm just very proud of myself because I used the cucumber that I grew myself.
79002	81063	And I made myself some salad.
81263	82524	And it's fantastic.
82624	86026	Soon you're going to be moving into a commune and starting your own...
86346	92852	Okay, I have five plants that I'm growing in the backyard and three of them are like stuff to season with.
92953	93733	Remember the fort?
94714	95135	The fort?
95255	95775	The fort.
95935	98478	It was, oh, this was years ago in OLR history.
98498	101541	This was probably around like when DDR Angel first started coming to the show.
101581	103943	Probably around like episode like 30-ish, right?
103963	104204	Yeah.
104564	106526	And she had a friend and...
107935	109256	I can't remember the dude's name.
109316	110977	I'm a horrible... Well, I remember his real name.
110997	112178	I don't want to say it on the show.
112238	119942	It was D-U... Yeah, I think I remember because I think... But he lived out in the middle of nowhere, right?
120062	128267	And to get to his house, you had to go by this place in the middle of nowhere with all these signs that were like, keep out and trespassers will be shot on sight.
128307	132270	And it just looked like some dude has had himself holed up in there since the 60s.
132290	134031	And we decided to call that the OLR Fort.
134171	134311	Oh, yeah.
134331	136052	And that's who we're all going to move into, remember?
136072	136152	Yeah.
136152	137813	I don't think we screwed with it at all.
137973	138814	Are we guys hearing Loki?
163846	164026	I'm tired.
188081	189302	I plugged it in the out hole.
189562	190222	Oops.
190922	191483	That's what happens.
191643	192543	Well, happy birthday.
192603	193124	A little late.
193344	193684	Thank you.
193804	194324	That's right.
194644	195385	Never forget.
195465	197065	September 11th, Loki's birthday.
197706	199787	No, I'm being a little bit silly.
199827	202068	You don't have any tragedies on your birthday, do you?
203389	204709	No, but I do have a victory.
204909	207851	My birthday, there's two reasons my birthday rocks.
208811	210672	One, it's the day that Strom Thurmond died.
211993	214794	And B, it's the day that sodomy laws were overturned in Texas.
215354	216535	That's what I get on my birthday.
216855	218717	See, my birthday was the Waco thing.
219117	219578	Oh, was it?
219718	219998	Yeah.
220339	220459	Oh.
220839	223162	No, no tragedies on my birthday yet, just victories.
223562	223862	Bitch.
224103	228507	So, talking about something funny made out of tragedy, I guess.
229648	239919	There's this pet and feed store that's near my house or whatever, and they have this horse statue that's out in front of, like a full-size horse statue that's out in front of their building.
240259	245082	And they dress it up for Halloween or St.
245142	247143	Paddy's Day, all the different stuff.
247163	248424	They dress it up themed like that.
249304	252666	So they decided, hey, we're going to dress it up for 9-11.
253307	259431	And so this horse has a replica of the Twin Towers on its back.
260271	260851	And it's like...
262072	263312	That almost sounds tacky.
263852	265353	It is extremely tacky.
265413	266733	I get wanting to be patriotic.
266773	273855	And I do think they kind of should make a day out of 9-11 as a remembrance and a day to kind of celebrate all things American.
273895	276636	Although I realize it's also like the 4th of July as it is.
276656	277196	But you know what I mean?
277556	282177	Like, it's too bad that that had to happen on your birthday.
282217	284818	But it's just, you know, some people are born on Christmas.
285298	289199	Some people are born on, you know, the day sodomy laws are repealed.
289539	290619	Some people are born...
291019	305974	on 9-11 and you know it's just a birthday yeah what can you do at least if you're born on Easter you don't always have to have it again on Easter true or if you're born February 29th you get to stay young for a very long time even though you look really old for your age yes
306843	307443	Alright, anyhow.
308764	310946	Let's start, I guess, with a little bit of How's Your Gaming Week.
310966	312106	Oh, I should say about the marathon.
312146	313287	I want to thank the listeners for stuff.
313307	314308	The marathon was awesome.
314788	317330	And if you haven't heard it all, it's all up on the feed now.
317870	319711	We went for 10 and a half hours live.
319731	323854	When you take out the music, it was about 9 hours, 30, 40 minutes worth of podcast.
324294	324995	And good times.
325055	328297	And we didn't end up playing any games live on air like we thought we were going to.
328697	331078	So, just really good times.
331359	332039	We did match games.
332219	333660	No, no, no, I meant video games.
333940	334441	Oh, oh.
334521	335582	Not the OLR games.
335922	337943	But yeah, I mean, and big thanks to Alan and Bradley too.
337963	338604	Dan sure did.
338624	339204	Without their help.
339744	339985	Yeah, Dan.
340005	341506	He played the game that shall not be named.
341566	342607	For a very long time.
343207	345829	Yes, he was playing the Reach Around game for some time.
347000	347761	He and his friend.
349622	350963	He and Alex were playing Reach Around.
351323	352604	Has he finished the game yet?
352724	353585	I have no idea.
353665	360229	Dan left for Washington State to go spend like eight days with his family and leave me here by my heel.
360469	360930	Oh, whatever.
360950	363872	You're going to run around the house naked and play Star Trek online.
363992	364973	That's what I do anyway.
366994	367755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
388428	389249	I wasn't naked.
390069	397233	I was playing Star Trek Online when Rob came in, and I actually stopped in the middle of the part that I was on, because when I start the game, I'll just start right back from where I am.
397553	399714	Which is a very good thing about Star Trek Online.
400455	403536	Unless you're right at the beginning of it, and you're almost done with the first part, and then you die.
403636	404757	Anyway.
406438	408119	I played Peggle.
408159	411501	You know, I haven't touched Epic Citadel since I downloaded it, except to upgrade it.
413043	416231	And I really haven't done much else in the way of gaming.
417193	418155	Well, Dan got...
422436	422936	Dead Rising 2.
423597	427178	I always want to say Left 4 Dead, but it's Dead Rising 2, the Mission Zero.
427198	427599	Case Zero.
427799	429079	Oh, yeah, yeah, Case Zero.
429380	433902	And he's gotten all of the endings, except, man, the bad ending where the little girl turns into a zombie.
434702	435823	OMG, spoilers.
435963	436463	Don't care.
437624	443087	If you haven't downloaded it yet, and if you haven't got there by now, then I don't want to hear it.
443487	444627	Plus, it's kind of obvious.
444767	446728	It doesn't even show her turning into a zombie.
446988	448528	Well, I mean, she's a child.
448809	449289	I don't care.
449389	450889	I wanted to see a zombie five-year-old.
453410	454550	I'm sorry you were disappointed.
454950	456691	I mean, it's like when you watch zombie movies.
456851	457571	Okay, okay.
458091	459511	When you watch zombie movies, right?
459952	469674	Shouldn't there be, like, zombie dogs and children and zombie old people and, you know, and, like, zombies in wheelchairs and... Well, actually, there was in Shaun of the Dead.
470194	472115	I suppose it depends on how graphic you want to get.
474405	476568	and all the people in hospitals turning into zombies and stuff.
477530	479874	It just doesn't make sense to me.
482496	484578	I also have that problem with zombie video games.
484698	485419	It was pretty cool though.
485779	497808	Especially my favorite weapon that you can make in that game is you can get a pitchfork and attach it to a rifle and then you can stab them with the pitchfork, pull them up in the air and shoot them with the shotgun and they'll explode.
498008	498608	That's awesome.
498789	502271	And you can also go to this place and get a broadsword and slice zombies down the middle.
502772	504353	And you can make the nail bat and everything.
504413	506675	But man, the pitchfork bayonet
507675	508455	That's innovation.
508696	515398	I haven't figured out any weapon combinations outside of the nails and bat only because I was specifically shown that at E3.
516179	516899	How to do that.
517139	518219	Pitchfork, rifle.
519040	522041	You try to figure stuff out and then also you get cards.
522921	525382	And you can take all that stuff into the main game later on.
525683	527063	And it even has a dude throwing up.
528684	528984	Hooray?
530034	533995	And then you can tape him to a cat, and he becomes a weapon, right?
535256	536816	But I do love that idea.
537136	554181	It certainly seems one step past the Fable 2 pub games, which was a neat little innovation in itself, but this is kind of like taking it to the next level, where now a game's demo is actually a whole different game, and yeah, you pay for it, but it's kind of a standalone experience, and you get to take what you've earned into the main game.
554221	554761	It's kind of neat.
554901	556142	And it's got three different endings.
556402	557903	It's reverse DLC.
558584	561406	It's not download content to expand the game.
561546	563628	It's download content to begin the game.
563688	565570	It's very strange, but I like it.
565970	566971	It was really cool.
568652	573356	When Dan did one of the bad endings, he had the dude with a mohawk wearing a waitress dress.
574317	575638	And I was like, okay, that's pretty funny.
575658	579741	Because you see this burly guy walking in wearing this dress.
579781	580161	And I'm like...
580922	582323	And then falling to his knees.
582563	585225	I can't wait to see some of the hideous costumes you can put the main character in.
585245	591110	Because I'll tell you what, some of the best parts of the first one were some of the really skanky costumes you could put Frank West into.
591170	592231	Like putting them in children's clothing?
592351	592611	Yes.
593392	594312	In the Mega Man outfit.
594572	596414	This one's set in Las Vegas, isn't it?
596654	596854	Yes.
597254	601758	So we need to have the whole showgirls, you know, big fan tale.
601878	603359	And we have to go find Tiara Zombie.
603599	603719	Yeah.
603739	607082	Because she lives in Vegas and will undoubtedly be a zombie in the game.
607562	610024	We won't aim for the head on the tiara zombie.
610064	613447	Yes, I'll refrain from using the pitchfork bayonetta on tiara.
613787	616909	What I'll do, I'll put a cardboard box on her head and just watch her run around.
618438	621941	We'll keep her in the garden playing PS2 games like in Shaun of the Dead.
622161	624103	I can't wait to see what kind of comment we get from her.
624123	625884	Because she's on AOL during the show, right?
626185	626705	Yeah, I don't know.
626905	628006	I have to ask her.
628026	628487	She's listening.
628847	629047	All right.
629688	629908	Let's see.
629948	632230	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
632970	633211	Let's see.
633231	637474	A hit stun suggests a cat gun to which Actdeft is saying laser cat gun.
638034	639035	That would be a great weapon.
639215	640757	I could see using a laser cat.
640797	641858	That would be amazing.
641998	642378	Perhaps.
643899	645340	Loki, how was your gaming week?
646341	657370	I'm pretty eventful actually because we did our game summit thing at our work where we invite publishers and some of our customers out and we did it this year kind of expo style I guess.
657930	661533	Each publisher had a different booth for the ones that showed up.
661933	667878	Not that many brought games though even though I offered them like hey if you need to borrow a 360 or something I can help you out with that.
669139	674263	So I only played really like a few different things and
674503	677766	The first one, and there is a video out there of it somewhere.
678286	679447	I don't want to know where though.
680508	683811	The first game I played this week was Just Dance 2.
684812	691177	And only because the Ubisoft rep wanted to demonstrate it and no one would play it.
691457	692378	So I was like, okay, fine.
693339	695060	I'll do this and be a good sport about it.
696261	698723	So I did that and she kicked my ass in every single song.
699284	701105	Even though she says she didn't play it before.
701345	701986	I don't believe her.
702006	702046	Um...
704386	705187	It was actually kind of fun.
705507	714014	It's kind of neat, because the game itself, if you haven't played it yet, it's going to be very similar to what Dance Central, I guess, is going to be.
715295	730368	It pretty much just plays like that, and all you do is you hold the remote, and you just kind of mimic what's on the screen, and it will just kind of... It'll only detect what you're doing with the remote, but it's still pretty close, and it's fun, and it's got some decent songs in there, so...
733450	734930	Did you jam to TikTok?
736050	737251	Did you get your Kesha on?
737411	738611	Yes, we did, actually.
739151	740752	God, why?
741112	742152	Why is this not on YouTube?
742172	742933	I didn't pick that song.
743013	745693	Why is there not video of Loki playing Just Dance 2?
745954	746914	I am so upset.
746934	747534	This is a tragedy.
747574	748914	What do you mean, why isn't this on YouTube?
749055	750375	It is on YouTube, I think.
750395	751615	Oh, my God, where?
751875	752596	I don't know.
752756	756477	I need to... My boss took... Wait, there is video of you on YouTube playing Just Dance 2.
756517	758498	I... Oh, my God.
758578	759238	Let's see here.
760218	765120	TigerClaw, he's the best web scavenger I know.
765180	766861	TigerClaw needs to find this somehow.
767041	768822	Use your Google Foo Ninja abilities.
769802	773264	I don't know if my boss has uploaded it yet because they were taking video.
776905	778886	Oh man, as soon as this is up, you've got to tell me.
779767	781447	Yeah, I do, I guess.
782408	784969	Anyways, try not to sound too excited.
787390	789331	I'm going to see if I can find...
792714	793694	I'm sorry, you can find it later.
793854	795595	I don't want to cause too much dead air while you search.
795835	796395	Yeah, no problem.
796975	802137	Anyways, so other than Just Dance 2, I got to play around with some of the move demo stuff.
803397	808118	I played actually the full version of Sports Champions, which is kind of fun.
808498	811999	I kind of like the archery that's in the game, and that was pretty cool.
812439	814660	It sucks, though, because at the time, though, the demo...
815020	815680	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
833328	834349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
851729	853090	I'm horrible at frisbee golf.
853830	855190	I tried a little bit of the table tennis.
855270	857131	I don't care for the table tennis too much.
857991	864233	How did archery in the PlayStation Move sports game compare to archery in Wii Sport Resort or whatever it was?
864253	869674	I haven't played Wii Sports Resort yet, but I think it would be way more accurate than it is.
870134	872395	Because it's just...
873482	875744	I don't know, it just felt right, I guess.
875904	880348	I haven't played it with two of the controllers yet.
880448	881589	I do have my own kit now.
881969	889035	I have two of the Move controllers, which Rob was sticking on his chest earlier, and I'm sure there's pictures online.
889235	892058	I would not say that those pictures exist on Twitter.
893737	895498	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
919694	923320	so that it can't be played for a week, thus frustrating people.
924441	934475	So actually, I went to GameStop and Best Buy today, and no one had any of the stuff that's already out for the move, which is disappointing because I have just the demos to play right now, which is fine.
934535	935116	They're still fun.
935897	940882	Um, another demo I checked out was Eyepet, and I gotta say, Eyepet is retarded.
941222	942944	And it really does not work.
944225	952273	It seems like a neat idea at first, but, you mean, to actually get it so that it looks right, you have to get the camera at, like, the perfect angle.
953094	956077	And really, it just works like a really crappy, um...
958115	961638	iToy game, you know, like way back in the PlayStation 2 and stuff.
961778	964401	And it's just, it's not good at all.
964621	968805	It doesn't lend well to the argument that this is just the iToy all over again, right?
969225	969786	It does not.
970509	973151	Thankfully, though, that's the only game that that's the case with.
976294	978456	They have you do a few different things.
978696	983261	For example, they have you play with him.
983421	987284	I guess you move your fingers or whatever, and he's supposed to roll over and stuff.
987925	989787	And it just did not detect that.
989807	992129	It just was having trouble figuring out what I was trying to do.
992709	1009217	and then it had me draw an airplane and he'd fly around in it and I don't know what the problem was with this but for some reason I mean I'm pretty good at tracing outlines and stuff you know like on the Wii and the DS and that kind of thing
1009697	1016340	But when I tried to trace the outline for the plane using the PlayStation Move Controller, it looked like crap.
1016900	1019021	It just was not working too well.
1019121	1020422	But, you know, hey, whatever.
1020762	1022103	It's a crappy game to begin with.
1022383	1025124	And then also they have you trying to wash him.
1025764	1027105	And the problem is I couldn't tell.
1027765	1033448	Like, I had trouble figuring out whether my Move Controller was in front or behind him and stuff like that.
1033568	1036289	So I had to kind of try to figure out where to turn it in perspective.
1036349	1037350	It's just very awkward.
1038050	1039111	So, I don't recommend that game.
1039151	1042473	But, I mean, most people figure out it's a waste of time anyways.
1043753	1045154	Then, what else did I try?
1045815	1046995	I tried the Tiger Woods demo.
1047516	1048156	That worked alright.
1048696	1050878	It's just very difficult to get it set up so that...
1053666	1055948	So you can use the move controller.
1056288	1058509	At least I found that it was kind of difficult to get it set up.
1059530	1069075	Oh, and calibrating it's actually pretty easy as far as... Because I was reading some reviews for different things and they were saying that they had to constantly calibrate the controller.
1069536	1070877	I didn't find that to be the case actually.
1070897	1073318	With Sports Champions, you calibrate it once and you're good to go.
1074839	1075679	So that was kind of cool.
1076980	1079342	And I'm trying to think what else I played that was kind of fun.
1080222	1080882	I tried the...
1084238	1092482	It's like some kung fu game where you actually roll down the street on office chairs and that was crap.
1093243	1094263	It did not control well.
1094583	1095824	But Sports Champions is fun.
1097091	1101815	Wasn't there a minigame in Incredible Crisis where you go down the street in a chair?
1101895	1104397	No, it's on a gurney.
1104617	1106218	Yes, it's on the hospital bed, yeah.
1106319	1107239	Yeah.
1107259	1116147	Looking at our chatroom, chat.orangeonstrater.com, Blackwolf is in our chat, the good pal of ours that does the show before us, live at All Games Radio when we tape live on Sunday nights.
1116387	1117368	He says, Oh, cool.
1117408	1120111	I didn't realize that Move was coming out on Friday and not Sunday.
1120171	1121492	Originally, it was coming out on Sunday.
1121512	1121612	Okay.
1121812	1122833	Yeah, they kept moving it around.
1122873	1126297	In fact, the Sony reps had trouble remembering what day it was supposed to be coming out on.
1126377	1128459	But yeah, it's Friday now, not Sunday.
1129140	1133124	Although there are some games coming out on Sunday, but you don't really need to mess with those.
1133184	1134606	It's just the Brunswick bowling game.
1136108	1137189	So would you be paying money for this?
1138089	1158236	would i be paying money for it if you didn't already have it in your hot little hands would you pay money for it um i might but the problem is like i don't know how much i'm gonna play with this but it's it's pretty fun um you know it's definitely if if you like the wii stuff you're gonna probably like this but it is a lot more sensitive i think so they kind of took what they did on the wii and
1158894	1160294	Improved upon it, which is good.
1160675	1166116	So, you know, as long as they come out with good games for it, then I don't think it's a bad investment at all.
1167397	1167737	All right.
1167897	1174879	And the best part about it, this is like, you know, a lot of the stuff you probably don't need to get the navigation controller for because most of the games don't use it.
1175479	1175879	Oh, wow.
1176179	1181361	And, you know, really, you're only going to use the navigation controller if you're playing like SOCOM or Killzone 3, I think.
1181641	1195818	I gotta admit, I'm not sure it's the greatest idea that they do this whole separate skews for like a, you know, camera, a camera and one controller, a controller and the navigation.
1196098	1200503	You know, it kind of seems like it's too complicated to figure out what you need and with all these different...
1201424	1206167	I like that they did that, though, because I own a camera.
1206487	1209688	So, like, now that I've got the kit, I've got two cameras.
1209849	1216952	But the whole optional navigation controller, which I guess is true on the Wii to an extent, but every Wii comes with one, at least.
1217092	1219333	So, you know, the designers know they can do at least one.
1219353	1225857	Well, technically, it still comes with one because it comes with a regular DualShock controller, which can double as a navigation controller if you want it to.
1226137	1226217	Oh.
1227278	1253458	so if you really I mean it's kind of awkward to hold it because you have to hold it with one hand but I mean if you don't really care then you can use that as a navigation controller if for example you're playing Killzone 3 or something like that and you want to try out the move controls and you have a move controller but you don't have the navigation controller you can get by with that but you may want to get an actual navigation controller later on
1253932	1264178	Looking at our chat room live on this Sunday night at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw is saying, speaking of move, Sony launched an anti-connect site about the buttons called yaybuttons.com.
1264458	1267720	I'd heard about this, but it wasn't on our list for tonight.
1267760	1268900	Have you looked at this site at all?
1270061	1274264	Yeah, I mean, that's great that they have a campaign about yay buttons and stuff like that.
1275445	1277386	I do love that website name, I gotta say.
1277807	1279788	Yay buttons is a good name for a site.
1279868	1281930	That's a stupid argument to make right now.
1281970	1291477	I mean, because even Microsoft came out and said, well, we never said that we can't have a game that uses both the Kinect camera and a controller.
1292377	1296180	So, you know, hooray with your campaign and everything.
1296560	1310310	and really all these games that they have out there right now just use either the trigger or the top move button or basically the A and B button on a Wii Remote because a lot of these games play just like Wii games.
1310931	1312372	I mean, it's... What a shock.
1312832	1315194	I know, what a shock that they play like Wii games.
1316875	1317215	I don't know.
1319176	1319817	It's kind of fun.
1321932	1328296	I mean, if you're looking for something that's going to be way better than the Wii, you're probably not going to find it with this.
1329117	1329517	All right.
1329697	1334400	So what games do we have to look forward to on the move that you're going to be checking out for us?
1336041	1340544	Well, the, you know, Sports Champions.
1341125	1341905	That's pretty good.
1344087	1348790	I actually haven't played it yet, but there's that Time Crisis Raising Storm.
1349350	1350091	That looked kind of fun.
1350831	1353812	I like the Toy Story 3 game, but if it's too much money, I wouldn't bother.
1354753	1355313	It was cute, though.
1355533	1358214	You reminded me of Midway Mania, which is what I liked.
1358734	1364516	I might check out... I'm trying to think what else I would probably pick up for that.
1365837	1366197	I don't know.
1366497	1371559	It's hard to say right now, because I'm not going to pick up SOCOM.
1371579	1373200	I don't know.
1373260	1375140	Maybe some of the PlayStation Network games.
1375881	1378802	I'll just see whatever they throw my way, because I don't want to spend a lot of money.
1380347	1380707	All right.
1381268	1382869	Well, let's talk about MyGamingWeek.
1382949	1386772	Actually, before we get to MyGamingWeek, though, I want to make a special phone call here a little bit.
1386892	1390135	I'm going to actually call... He was here last week on the show.
1390195	1391937	He's Alan, a.k.a.
1391977	1393618	SalaciousPop, a.k.a.
1393678	1399223	my boyfriend, is sitting there at his computer, and he knows we're calling him because I want to talk about something here tonight.
1399683	1400343	Hey, Alan, are you there?
1401865	1403566	Hey, hi, coming to us via Skype.
1403906	1408969	So, Alan, you live in the Bay Area in California, right?
1409909	1410130	Yes.
1410290	1414892	And you don't live that far away from where there was actually a really bad tragedy this week, right?
1416253	1416493	Yep.
1416633	1418014	Tell us a little bit about what happened.
1418394	1424377	Thursday evening at about 6.15, a giant gas main several feet across blew up.
1425187	1428188	underneath some houses and kind of destroyed an entire neighborhood.
1429228	1429869	Very sad.
1429929	1434030	And somebody's going to be in a lot of trouble when they sort through all that mess.
1434050	1435830	But very, very sad tragedy.
1436171	1437831	So, I mean, was it scary?
1437871	1438991	Did you have to evacuate?
1439031	1440072	Did you have to get out of the house?
1440172	1440712	What happened?
1441972	1443653	Well, it happened.
1444693	1447394	The neighborhood affected is maybe two miles
1447904	1448844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1469173	1471555	This block that I'm on was totally unaffected.
1471695	1474537	All of the wind blew all the smoke and everything south.
1495410	1500472	Boom noise and things actually shook for a minute and my car had ash on it.
1500832	1501592	It was crazy.
1501912	1502832	It was really sad.
1503193	1506754	But you didn't hear a giant boom?
1506814	1507954	You didn't feel the shake?
1508074	1509535	Or was it just, oh, another earthquake?
1509975	1510475	I don't get it.
1510615	1512376	What happened?
1512516	1519098	Only being two miles away and the explosion being as large as it was did actually shake the building that I'm in.
1519738	1522519	Apparently it rattled windows for miles in every direction.
1523380	1528442	I was completely oblivious though because at the time I was raiding in WoW.
1532424	1535645	Which is really the punchline that you were trying desperately to get me to.
1535905	1545849	So yes, I was raiding in WoW while 53 homes were completely razed and my housemate had to tell me to look out the window to see all the black smoke.
1546590	1561543	Yes, there's the punchline I was looking for and why I brought you on to tell this horrible tragedy story on the Video Game Radio show is that you missed total chaos and tragedy going on mere miles away because you were trying to get Festergat down.
1562624	1563245	Yeah.
1564406	1565727	Everyone's judging me right now.
1565887	1566868	Did you get any loot?
1569470	1571011	No, I got no good drops.
1571552	1571672	Oh.
1572926	1576628	What must have been your reaction, though, when you opened up the window and just saw all the smoke?
1576668	1579089	Were you just like, oh, damn.
1580289	1582830	Well, yeah, I was like, that's not good.
1582870	1587312	And then I went to KCBS and SFGate and I started looking at the feeds.
1587913	1593335	Because there was a huge boom that set off the gas explosion and people...
1593959	1595000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1619744	1623810	The fire burned for a couple hours because they couldn't turn the gas main off.
1623870	1624992	That was like a big blowtorch.
1625072	1626094	Oh my gosh, so sad.
1628097	1634000	I can't even imagine just being at home watching Oprah or being like DarkSakura sitting around naked playing Star Trek online.
1635441	1641444	And then suddenly, kaboom, oops, PG&E didn't notice the crack in the pipe.
1641604	1641905	Uh-oh.
1642245	1643625	You know what's actually kind of sad, though?
1643946	1646787	And again, I seriously don't mean to make light of a tragedy.
1646847	1653071	It's just kind of interesting that sometimes we get so in the zone of gaming that we miss these things.
1653351	1653931	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1683471	1684412	Thank you, fire department.
1710226	1717713	When I was in grade school and living in Martinez, Martinez has a huge, ugly shell oil refinery behind it.
1717793	1722737	For anyone that's ever been in Martinez, it looks very Blade Runner.
1722797	1724199	It's very gross and huge.
1724279	1725580	And that had an explosion.
1725860	1726581	Oh, no.
1727682	1731385	And I think like two or three workers, unfortunately, died at the time.
1731505	1732266	I was like 10 or 11 years old.
1733979	1735320	Starfire, Starfire, Starfire, I don't know.
1764680	1771408	All right, well, look, if you want to make a donation to the victims of San Bruno, which, you know, again, we don't mean to make fun of it.
1771428	1775653	We're making fun of Alan and the fact that he missed it and not making fun of what happened because it really is a tragedy.
1775993	1781700	We do definitely want you to consider maybe making a donation to the Red Cross to help the victims of the San Bruno fire.
1782060	1782621	Thank you for watching!
1805281	1834488	and for those OLR listeners living in the Bay Area that have donated blood that don't have ridiculous restrictions against them that prevents them from donating blood which archaic archaic things that need to be changed but you know unfortunately we don't want to hold those silly restrictions against the victims you know so we'll donate cash I guess yeah but definitely well thanks for calling hey no problem thanks for being on the show thank you for letting me make fun of you see this is why you rock yeah you rock goodnight night hon alright
1836124	1836864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1858716	1860598	It doesn't do anything.
1861439	1870346	And these are like two half-assed things that Apple has launched lately between Ping, which is like, I think it's like Twitter, but it's not because all it really shows is the music.
1871047	1877153	Game Room, you just have a friends list and you can see what games they own and what achievements they have.
1877293	1881596	But I have yet to see how that whole multiplayer integration works or anything like that.
1881697	1883038	I don't get it.
1883658	1884819	I haven't tried any of those.
1885140	1885440	I don't know.
1885760	1910829	But because I'm a sucker and because I had credit still from gift cards I got for like my birthday a few months ago I downloaded one of the Game Center compatible games It's a game called Grawl Classic Plus And I was drawn to check out this game because the artwork kind of makes it look like this little like Legend of Zelda-y, chibi type of game And it said it was an MMO So I was like, oh, that's kind of a neat idea Like an MMO on the iPhone that kind of looks like a Super Nintendo game, right?
1911249	1911549	Awesome
1912525	1915586	Oh my god, it's the worst thing I've ever played in my life.
1915766	1917646	It is so stupid.
1917806	1919347	Did you spend money on that?
1919607	1921867	Well, I spent someone else's money because it was gift cards.
1921907	1923728	I spent $1.99 on that.
1924208	1927188	And it is so stupid.
1927449	1934170	It's the equivalent of one of those MMOs that you would see the cards for at the grocery store that you just kind of laugh at.
1934210	1935690	Like, I'm never going to buy those, right?
1936371	1937571	It's worse than Farmville.
1938811	1939772	Farmville's pretty awful.
1939872	1940872	I don't understand.
1941052	1942293	I don't even understand the point.
1942553	1943834	There's no quest.
1943934	1945995	There's no leveling.
1946075	1952098	It's just make a character and run around stabbing bushes hoping you find little green gems in them.
1952498	1956200	I think there's guilds, but the chat is all screwed up.
1956400	1959322	It's just overcome with idiocy.
1960422	1966045	People yelling weird things in the road and trying to trick people into giving honor points and just...
1966505	1967546	I don't get it.
1967626	1969508	Why would anyone waste their time with this garbage?
1969528	1971049	Well, I did, I guess.
1971089	1973571	Boy, did I pick a stinker to test out Game Center with.
1974012	1979376	So now I've decided Game Center is completely stupid and a waste of time based on this one game that I played.
1980837	1981418	So, yeah.
1981980	1985202	That would be the one new game that I checked out this week.
1985242	1986803	Again, that's Grawl Classic Plus.
1986823	1994969	Look, if you want to burn $2 and look at how terrible this game is, it's one of those, I'm almost thinking it's so bad, you have to see it.
1995009	1998271	If anybody can figure out the point of this game, I would love to hear from you.
1998571	2003955	I would love to hear from the developers of this game of what it is they were trying to do with this game, because I don't get it.
2004675	2006536	Pull you into paying for it.
2008177	2008477	Help.
2010099	2010579	So there you go.
2011226	2012247	GameCenter, fail.
2012407	2013248	Ping, fail.
2014449	2016752	Grawl, whatever, plus plus, mega fail.
2018354	2020156	Otherwise it's just been more Warcraft.
2020216	2023759	Oh, I did play Dead Rising Case Zero myself and it was fun.
2024160	2027644	But I got eaten by a lot of zombies because I'm not very good at Dead Rising.
2028525	2029726	Did the military kill you?
2030453	2032235	Did you find all the bike parts?
2032295	2034837	No, I was trying to get to the van with the Zombrex and I got chewed up.
2034877	2035897	I didn't get very far at all.
2037158	2039821	But I liked that there were so many cutscenes and everything in an arcade game.
2039841	2040641	I thought that was kind of cool.
2040801	2041582	That was pretty neat.
2042363	2043203	I thought it was fun.
2044004	2044544	Pitchfork.
2045205	2045565	Rifle.
2046266	2046566	Win.
2046726	2049789	I'll take a look.
2049929	2050349	You know what?
2050649	2052371	It just occurred to me what a cool weapon would be.
2053291	2057034	Take like three broadswords and a pogo stick and you'd have pogo stab.
2057995	2058656	That would be awesome.
2059463	2070735	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeonstrater.com Marissa Congusto We love Marissa I love her Marissa, I love you Alright I'm gonna poop on Ping She's pooping Get it?
2071215	2082447	She's She's going to poop on Ping Pooping Because it censors tweets from artists Such as Gaga's pro-gay marriage tweets Eye roll It's useless anyway I didn't even know they did that
2083869	2084049	PooPing
2109969	2117873	I remember when Ping was just on the other IRC screen where it just went ping, ping, ping.
2118153	2123295	There was also an app for the iPhone for a limited time called Ping and it was like free SMS basically to put it lightly.
2123615	2126837	They changed their name a few months ago to Ping Chat and they never said why.
2126957	2127417	Now I know.
2127877	2131359	Because Apple probably said you better change your name or we're going to pooping on you.
2132039	2132579	So there you go.
2132599	2135741	Maybe we can release an app called Pooping.
2137935	2138395	You know what?
2138435	2143496	We should get someone who can program like that and do an app, you know, to make fun of it called Pooping.
2143636	2144597	Or Cropping.
2144657	2146957	It probably would not get approved by the App Store.
2146997	2148177	Maybe you could put it on Android.
2148757	2150098	Like a social network called Pooping.
2151138	2154559	And it could be all about, like, you know, because that's what Twitter's for.
2154639	2156499	Essentially all for talking shit about people.
2157539	2159760	Well, no, you know how you make tweets when you go to the bathroom.
2160140	2161120	I'm pooping right now!
2189132	2192193	Burger King Bathroom, well cleaned, smells like bleach.
2196975	2202297	Anyhow, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you'd like to join and join in the madness.
2204078	2207219	Marissa said that Steve Jobs said himself, no more fart apps.
2207480	2207780	Really?
2208080	2208720	Yeah.
2209660	2210861	That's a good thing, I think.
2211081	2212322	We don't need any more fart apps.
2213162	2218344	Alright, LightAmiga777 in chat says, OLRPoop, where there's smoke, they ping back.
2219909	2220549	I think I get that.
2220669	2220910	All right.
2221390	2224412	Let's go ahead and actually get into some gaming news tonight.
2224532	2225592	Oh, it's quick housekeeping.
2225872	2227493	Add us on Facebook.
2227533	2229114	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2229134	2229895	We also have a Twitter.
2229935	2231556	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2232136	2233537	And you should add us on those sites.
2234497	2235398	And yeah.
2235538	2238500	Otherwise, I don't think there's a whole lot of news going on here.
2239040	2241061	I'm going to be out the first week of October.
2241421	2243503	October 2nd, 3rd, somewhere in there.
2243783	2244923	I'm going to be gone that week.
2244983	2245864	So I don't know if there'll be a show.
2246224	2247045	Bring me pins.
2247065	2247766	I mean, there can be.
2248186	2249728	But I'm going to Gay Days at Disneyland.
2249748	2250489	Bring me pins.
2250669	2250849	Yes.
2251410	2251930	Lots of them.
2252070	2253592	I'm taking Alan for the first time since he was 18.
2253632	2254993	I know.
2255654	2257256	Don't worry, we're going back for Tron, remember?
2257456	2259718	Yes, we are, but you still must bring me pins.
2259859	2260119	I will.
2260639	2261821	Maybe they'll have a Tron pin.
2262241	2263723	If you find Tron pins, you better.
2263923	2264163	I will.
2264563	2266606	I will give you monies for pins for Tron.
2269150	2272291	All right, let's get into some actual bonafide gaming news.
2272311	2275293	We're only like 40 minutes in this show and haven't talked a lot about gaming news.
2275513	2277734	Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?
2278174	2284277	Well, lots of stuff, especially when it comes to PS3 and firmware and all that fun stuff.
2284617	2287858	Well, starting things off, you knew what was going to happen.
2287878	2292300	The PlayStation 3 got a mandatory firmware bringing it up to 3.42.
2292720	2299442	This firmware update does nothing other than break the PS jailbreak and the PS Groove hacks.
2300282	2308585	And since this was an overall security-related issue, it says we will provide no further commentary to this case.
2309545	2314887	Well, that's a wonderful thing to say, fucking dick of a Sony rep.
2316227	2321609	Well, to be fair, they don't... Well, why didn't they just say, you know... They don't really... We're not providing any commentary in this case.
2321709	2322049	Nah.
2322289	2325330	They don't... They can just say, we don't like people hacking our consoles, so we patched it.
2325470	2326390	Devil's advocate.
2326770	2328691	A, they don't owe you shit for an explanation.
2328851	2334493	B, maybe they plan to litigate against these people so they don't want to say anything publicly because there's going to be litigation in the future.
2335026	2341256	I don't know if they can because, I don't know, because the... Oh, come on, this is America, they can sue anyone.
2342418	2343339	They can try, I guess.
2345462	2347005	Trying's important for them.
2348465	2351707	Yay buttons, I don't know.
2353068	2360593	YayLawSuit.com No new features though in this latest firmware, right?
2360613	2362714	The only feature is disabling this hack.
2362734	2369178	If you are interested still in running homebrew stuff, and we will get to why the homebrew is not all bad.
2369418	2372660	Remember, it's just that backup device, that's a bad thing.
2372720	2373661	Homebrew, not so bad.
2374301	2377863	Of course, Sony just seized the backup device, and that's all they care about.
2378303	2383665	So, yeah, they patched it out, so if you don't want to update to 3.41, stay off the PlayStation Network.
2384926	2398052	It's interesting, though, because one of the things that actually did come around because of this is a way to enable any PlayStation 3 game to be played as a remote play game on your PSP.
2398633	2398833	Why...
2399913	2412637	They aren't like that in the first place is beyond me, but apparently it's a really simple edit to one of the files that's on there that you basically, you can actually run this program called a PS3 SFO editor.
2414057	2425200	Once you have your game dumped to the hard drive and you just click a button that says PSP remote play available and then click it and it will allow you to play it over your PSP.
2425800	2427861	including, you know, games that don't allow it.
2427921	2429202	Like, for example, Infamous.
2429242	2430363	They actually have video of that.
2430543	2432464	So, that's kind of neat.
2432884	2435246	And a feature I don't see why they don't have.
2435846	2438067	Maybe because it's buggy in some games.
2438207	2438607	I don't know.
2438688	2442390	But if it can be done, I don't know why they don't.
2443030	2445111	Well, you kind of answered your own question.
2445151	2447573	If it bugs in some games, that's going to be enough, I think.
2448393	2451015	It has to work consistently or they're not going to implement it, I would think.
2452375	2454297	Well, I don't know about that, but...
2455290	2457531	Has it ever stopped developers from rushing out games?
2459752	2460333	Point taken.
2463694	2464455	So, yeah, I don't know.
2466076	2468357	And then, let's see, other fun stuff.
2469938	2472859	Of course, the PlayStation Freedom.
2473539	2477642	It is the port of the PlayStation, or PS Groove, I guess.
2477982	2479382	It's basically the open source...
2481584	2482424	and many more.
2503036	2511201	and basically what this does is it runs a modified program on the Android operating system.
2511961	2516283	There's all the different things to do it that way, which is kind of interesting.
2516663	2521626	They actually have it ported, funny enough, to the TI-84.
2522226	2525708	Man, those calculators can do anything.
2526008	2526369	Wow.
2526669	2527469	They still make those?
2527829	2530391	That was a graphing calculator back in my day.
2530411	2530491	Yeah.
2530951	2534755	Yeah, or maybe it was the 82, I don't know, but still.
2534895	2538178	Well, they had the 84s back in my day, but I think they're a little bit newer now.
2539019	2541702	But yeah, they actually... You're officially 30 now, you're old.
2541942	2544965	I'm sorry to interrupt, I've been told to make a small noise to show I care.
2545426	2545706	Okay.
2547768	2547968	What?
2549890	2550551	You can continue.
2551904	2566878	Other devices that the PS Freedom has been ported to, the HTC Droid Incredible, the HTC Wildfire, the HTC Magic 32A, the Dream G1, Magic 32B, these are all HTC Foams, the Palm Pre...
2570441	2571122	The Dingu!
2571642	2572683	I actually have a Dingu.
2572723	2575545	I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet, but I may try that.
2575846	2592240	The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1, the Nokia N900 or N800 or N810, the Droid, the Droid Eris, of course, the original, oh, and the Palm Pre...
2594045	2595827	Yeah, so basically everything.
2597028	2600392	And if it's not out for your device, it will probably be ported to it.
2602952	2629055	I guess it's not such a bad thing if you're really interested in actually putting this exploit on your console it should be readily available to do so and if it's not for stuff that you may have at home right now it will be probably soon I'm sure a piece of french toast will eventually be able to be used in hacking your PS3 just have to give it some time
2630410	2635231	I did forget to mention earlier in the show that because, you know, you're now officially 30, right, Loki?
2635431	2635831	Yes, I am.
2635891	2641593	So now it's officially the gaming show for 30-somethings is Orange Lounge Radio.
2641653	2642153	That's right.
2642593	2644713	The old crotchety video gaming show.
2645254	2648814	We actually have a new theme song for the new Orange Lounge Radio we're going to be debuting.
2649055	2649375	Do we?
2649775	2652055	Yeah, we should have done it tonight, but we'll do it next week.
2652615	2654636	Since we're so old, here's our new theme song, you guys.
2654756	2655076	Here we go.
2658894	2661416	Hey, on the DSi, there's a new firmware update as well.
2661717	2661957	The 1.4.1U.
2661997	2665180	It's a new update on the DSi firmware.
2665220	2666141	Guess what it does?
2680439	2683701	Ah yes, it blocks piracy and certain flashcards and all that stuff.
2683741	2684561	Which, you know, I understand.
2684581	2686322	They have a right to block piracy.
2686762	2688023	Copying games is bad.
2688783	2689223	I get that.
2689263	2691784	But these types of things also block out the homebrew.
2692105	2693245	Which is the really fun stuff.
2693825	2695846	So anyway, the new firmware update on the DSi.
2695886	2697667	It's the first update they've done in about a year.
2698127	2699228	No new functionality.
2699288	2703650	It just does, quote, behind-the-scenes improvements to system performance.
2704210	2709053	Which means some of the flash cartridges that allowed the Leetaxors no longer work.
2709893	2717316	Some of the affected cards are the Ace Card 2i, the Super Card DS2, the M3i0, the iPlayer, and the DSTTI.
2717396	2719257	I didn't even know all these things existed.
2719857	2721898	Did you know about the existence of all these cards, Loki?
2721918	2722879	I've never heard of half of these.
2722919	2723179	Yeah.
2723199	2723599	Wow.
2725370	2726291	There's a lot of them out there.
2726331	2727892	Most people just know the R4.
2728772	2731895	Some cards did manage to escape the patch.
2732355	2736918	The iSmart DS, the Easy Flash VI, and the Hyper R4.
2737279	2738099	Ah, yes, the R4.
2738840	2739400	So there you go.
2739981	2748427	And a lot of these, too, it's possible that they will have firmware updates to the actual cards themselves that may re-enable them.
2750228	2751489	It's a back-and-forth game.
2752188	2753948	You know, I get it.
2754069	2759910	I mean, they owe it to their developers and they owe it to themselves to try and stop piracy.
2760750	2764971	But it does kind of stink that there isn't at least some type of open channel for homebrew.
2765071	2774374	I mean, I feel like the only group whatsoever that has somewhat embraced homebrew, granted in an ultimately controlled environment, is Microsoft and the indie games.
2774514	2776554	But even then, that's really controlled.
2776574	2779135	Or even Apple with their App Store.
2779155	2779235	Yeah.
2779375	2782418	Yeah, even though apps have to go through scores and scores of approvals.
2782438	2783138	But you know what?
2783339	2785781	There's fart apps galore and all this stupid shit.
2785801	2786982	But see, that's the thing, though.
2787002	2792607	Can you imagine if these people were able to program apps for, like, say, the Nintendo DSi?
2793547	2795589	I mean, it may be a little bit more difficult, but...
2797250	2798431	It would be really interesting.
2798511	2802013	I'm surprised Nintendo's DSi doesn't try to cash in on the app craze.
2802253	2803594	I thought it was to some extent.
2803874	2805495	They have the DSi store and so forth.
2805515	2806936	They're so behind though.
2807036	2811259	Open it up to let people make their own things.
2811319	2813640	Make them charge 99 cents for it and take half.
2814040	2816662	How long did it take them to finally come out with WiiWare?
2816742	2818243	Seriously.
2818343	2819564	They're so behind.
2821084	2821865	I'm not surprised.
2825351	2851319	I'm bummed for the homebrew it's a little harder to feel sympathy for pirates the jig is up kids but for homebrew you're kind of like oh bummer there's also another update to the Wii system firmware as well it's actually still marked as the current firmware but it will remove all the homebrew that you have installed on your system but does the exploit still work or did they patch that too?
2852452	2852852	DarkSakura
2875489	2877591	We're actually having a discussion about food in the chat room.
2877991	2878592	What kind of food?
2879152	2879793	Jewish food.
2880193	2883016	All I see, I see roly poly fish heads from Jessica Harper.
2883056	2883617	That's not food.
2884057	2884898	I don't eat fish heads.
2885238	2886719	Although I did eat something very unique.
2887380	2889302	I had herring in sour cream.
2890486	2891626	Thanks for watching!
2908713	2910253	He made his own little... He did the chicken.
2910273	2911954	He did his own little breadcrumb thing.
2912014	2912774	It was really cute.
2913634	2913974	I know.
2915575	2916315	Read the story.
2916775	2917795	Read the damn story.
2917875	2920656	That's so cute and gay.
2922456	2927177	Well, for LittleBigPlanet 2, there is good news.
2927217	2930458	That is, if you played a lot of LittleBigPlanet the first...
2931878	2938922	And that is the beta invites are going out, but it's just for people who are super active in LittleBigPlanet.
2939482	2945886	So I guess that they're checking people who create, upload, who play regularly.
2947046	2949188	So here's the major points.
2949648	2954270	And also, they're not actually out recruiting beta testers.
2954290	2956952	They're just sending the invites to people who play the game a lot.
2957772	2967674	Some of those points are you have to be 18 years or older and be a resident in a country which we operate the PlayStation Store.
2969174	2974296	The beta will be in English, so you have to provide feedback in English.
2974336	2980677	The beta test community and the existing LittleBigPlanet beta testers will automatically be included in the beta trial.
2982498	3001575	and it says please note that being selected for this beta does not give you access to other beta trials we may operate that's a big duh the last thing is that participation in the beta trials is subject to their beta trial agreement you have to agree which I pretty much think means you know don't go spilling all this crap to other people which you know is going to happen
3005083	3006446	I think that's a good way to do it.
3007408	3011075	Because then they'll be giving it to people who understand the mechanics of the game.
3011716	3014602	I mean, the more that you play something clearly, the more you understand it, right?
3014843	3015264	What, Rob?
3017092	3017712	You looked funny.
3018072	3020633	No, I'm reading chat and having fun with them.
3021473	3024934	But no, as far as the way they're doing the beta invites, it makes sense.
3025114	3025554	It's cute.
3026114	3026834	It's a good way to do it.
3027154	3027834	Yeah, I think so.
3028614	3031795	I mean, I didn't really get that much into LittleBigPlanet, honestly.
3031815	3036356	Yeah, I know I'm not getting invited, but I think that's a... Why not get your hardcore community in there?
3036376	3041877	Because they're the ones that are A, going to most be shocked by the changes and B, probably test it the most.
3041917	3042957	You know, it makes sense.
3043377	3045597	I'm surprised they don't do the same thing with World of Warcraft.
3045877	3047538	Well, maybe that is how they send out the invites.
3047578	3048758	I don't know.
3048798	3050538	There's other ways you can get one.
3050618	3051138	I got one.
3051579	3053019	I probably shouldn't have it, but I do.
3054439	3055859	Touch you.
3056419	3057760	I actually haven't played it a whole lot.
3058680	3061340	A lot is still borked in the World of Warcraft beta.
3061640	3063941	What I really want in right now is the DC Universe beta.
3064681	3066241	That's what I really want to play right now.
3066621	3068782	You're not going to play Star Trek Online.
3068802	3070442	You need to give that card to someone who will.
3071082	3072823	I'll give it back if you really want it.
3072883	3074063	I'll check it out someday.
3074083	3075144	You have to play with me.
3075964	3076524	For ten days?
3076865	3077485	For ten days.
3078565	3081386	We'll go kill some Borg and then smack some Klingons around.
3081406	3081867	It'll be fun.
3082467	3082827	Good times.
3083287	3087249	There's got to be at least one other OLR listener that plays Star Trek Online.
3087329	3089450	We'll have to hunt down Travis because he plays.
3089650	3089950	Does he?
3090150	3090370	Yes.
3091170	3093612	I would play just to attack his ship in the middle of the night.
3093852	3095172	You'd have to play a Klingon.
3095272	3095792	Rob!
3096153	3097073	I think you'd have to play a Klingon.
3098277	3098537	Really?
3098817	3103218	And that means that you'd actually have to level up a character to, like, I think, Lieutenant Commander before you could actually play a Klingon?
3103238	3103758	Could I be like B'Elanna?
3103798	3104579	She was pretty fierce.
3104659	3107319	Could I be like B'Elanna, the half Klingon, half human?
3107499	3113101	You can sort of make one in... You get this selection... I don't know how we got from LittleBigPlanet... Wait, wait, wait.
3113281	3115461	Oh, we just broke the show with too much nerdiness.
3116081	3116982	Oh, that's too bad.
3118282	3122483	You get an option to choose Alien, and then you can customize him however you want him to look.
3122723	3122943	I see.
3124054	3131680	Digital Distribution seems to be catching on everywhere else, so why not the arcade?
3132560	3139325	Taito is going to at least try it, and they've introduced a new digital distribution system called Nessica X Live.
3140666	3145590	This was being shown off at the 48th Amusement Machine Show in Chiba.
3146650	3157574	and apparently it will allow arcade operators to purchase cabinets and then download games to the cabinets including a bunch of older titles as well as brand new releases.
3158454	3170558	They said that nine arcade game makers are supporting the platform including SNK and Cave and the first title release for the system will be none other than Taito's BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2.
3171939	3178836	and um that's kind of interesting I don't know if I'll ever make it out over here like that I mean I don't see why not but um
3180208	3180648	Thanks for watching!
3202506	3206430	I just have a feeling these will be easily dumped and stolen.
3206450	3207571	Of course, that's the first thing you think about.
3207591	3221646	Well, no, seriously, if you think about it, because it's going to have basically the same front end that's going to be running all these games, and all you're going to be doing is exchanging out the actual game data.
3221786	3224869	So if you put out that...
3226230	3227231	Arcade Games Elite
3245530	3247191	Have we seen this happen to some extent already?
3247272	3248092	Like a little bit?
3248372	3252276	Like I know some of the later Bomani games do this with the whole emusement and so forth.
3252356	3254037	And I think Technica does the same thing.
3254317	3257660	And I even think some of the fighting games are doing this now with some type of digital delivery, right?
3258040	3271751	I think it's a good idea in the sense that it will save arcade operators, at least if they were to implement this in the States, a whole lot of shipping costs because shipping arcade games is not cheap at all.
3272492	3273413	You know that firsthand.
3274854	3275975	Yes, somewhat.
3277696	3281679	I know that, too, because I priced trying to get a baby Pac-Man machine because that's how bad I wanted one.
3282100	3284502	And honestly, the machine itself, I could afford it.
3284522	3287184	It was the shipping that was going to kill me to get one of those machines.
3287944	3289806	That's how bad I want that stupid machine.
3290246	3291107	A baby Pac-Man?
3291127	3291948	A baby Pac-Man.
3292988	3293389	All right.
3293749	3294129	I know.
3294530	3297792	I'll track one down for you.
3297812	3298873	Finding one locally, maybe.
3298893	3299434	That would be cool.
3300635	3302356	But yeah, shipping is expensive.
3302576	3302816	So...
3305745	3309388	I mean, granted that they wouldn't be shipping out a new cabinet each time.
3309469	3315373	They would just be doing a cartridge or something like that if it were any other system.
3315493	3322739	But even still, I mean, that's one less expense they have to deal with, although then they have to have internet.
3322779	3324321	So maybe it evens itself out.
3324761	3328584	But at least when a game is released, they can have it there relatively quick.
3329385	3331847	Because if you were overnight a cabinet from...
3333368	3334268	Japan or something like that.
3334289	3335829	That would cost millions of dollars.
3336069	3339771	That boat would have to go very fast to get the machine over here.
3339791	3340231	Speedboat.
3341392	3342232	I'm dragging it behind.
3343233	3346334	You'd have to get Johnny Quest to get that machine out here that fast.
3348075	3348536	All right.
3348636	3354419	Well, I think it's a really interesting idea and I could see arcades going that way, but is it going to be enough to save them?
3354719	3355119	I don't know.
3356039	3357240	No, that all comes down to the games.
3357660	3359661	No one gives a crap how the games get to the arcade.
3359681	3361282	It's just what games are at the arcade.
3362768	3363569	What do you think they could do?
3363609	3366911	And we have this conversation once in a while on the show, and I'll open this up to the chat, too.
3367252	3369533	What do you think they could do to an arcade to make people come back?
3370194	3372976	Give them something that they can't get at home with consoles.
3373977	3374658	That's really it.
3375198	3381823	And right now, it's very difficult to come up with that kind of stuff because...
3383558	3386119	Lately it's community for the past 10 years or so.
3386719	3391281	DDR community, obviously, with this show owes its roots to.
3391421	3392302	Or fighting game community.
3392322	3394523	You can't readily get that stuff at home.
3395163	3404727	You can buy some homemade or really expensive dance pads and stuff, but it's still not the same as the arcade.
3405087	3409369	But now, though, with Guitar Hero and stuff, Guitar Freaks is kind of...
3411430	3435588	SSJ100 Matt in chat says free blowjobs, insert quarter, insert wiener That's not an arcade game, that's a peep show Free spankings Or like an Asian massage parlor, that is not an arcade Was that during the part of the marathon you were here for?
3436259	3438682	I don't think I was here for any part of the marathon.
3439162	3440483	I don't remember if it was in the first three hours.
3440563	3443946	No, I think that you were gone, but Rob played this funny YouTube video.
3443966	3444467	It was Alan.
3444707	3445488	Oh, Alan played it.
3445528	3446188	What was it?
3447029	3447770	The happy ending.
3448430	3448911	Oh, great.
3449551	3450092	I'll find it.
3450132	3450672	Keep talking.
3450732	3451213	Keep talking.
3451973	3452674	Get ready to wreck.
3453174	3457056	So, yeah, I don't know if there's a lot that they can do to revitalize.
3457096	3463899	It's just basically bringing out games that are going to be able to do stuff that you can't really do at home.
3463939	3465980	You know, the big old gun games.
3467200	3469822	Just giving people a reason to come to the arcade, kind of.
3471022	3473303	This is from Mediocre Films on YouTube.
3473343	3474284	They get full credit for this.
3474364	3476625	Mediocre Films is the name of the YouTube here.
3476685	3480146	This is called... Happy Ending.
3480687	3481507	Here you go, Loki.
3482187	3483068	Link it in the chatroom, too.
3483088	3488911	You like?
3489811	3490391	Oh, that's nice.
3492352	3492492	Oh.
3494133	3494353	Oh.
3496134	3496234	Oh.
3501416	3505747	She's sitting on his butt I love the generic Asian restaurant music they play in the background
3523784	3524705	She just took her dress off.
3524745	3525565	You liking this, Loki?
3526006	3526686	Good movie, huh?
3527527	3529348	His head is totally not laying on there right.
3530068	3532290	You're not supposed to lay on the little... You want a happy ending?
3532950	3533831	Fifty dollars.
3543717	3553421	There's like clowns and a juggler and puppets and balloons and a... This is what they need in arcades!
3556963	3557523	And they all leave.
3558363	3558983	She's clapping.
3559264	3560264	Are you happy now?
3562185	3564506	Well, it really wasn't what I was hoping for.
3565206	3566066	Oh, no.
3567147	3569368	Maybe you want a handjob.
3570048	3570768	Fifty dollars.
3571909	3572189	For a
3573396	3579618	Handjob, right?
3581878	3584659	Yeah, handjob.
3584819	3585519	Yeah, okay.
3585859	3586379	Okay.
3586619	3587439	Handjob!
3587459	3587639	Get it?
3587659	3588720	It's a hand jive.
3588740	3589800	Like grease.
3590040	3592881	See, wasn't that worth derailing the entire show to watch?
3592901	3593801	Yes, it was.
3603163	3604284	PSP Go Did you like that segue?
3624928	3627311	Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
3641966	3647008	I think we need to make sure we have as many titles available to download as possible to make the experience as easy as possible.
3661673	3680803	but also pricing is perhaps an issue because of the cost reductions we've been able to do over the years the traditional PSP has benefited but the PSP Go is a completely different design so the cost trend is different so there you go no I don't
3684642	3687764	was maybe pricing the problem with the PSP Go.
3687784	3697869	Maybe, or perhaps that you put out SKU with less features and then, I don't know, offered it for a more expensive price.
3698129	3699550	It's more expensive, yeah.
3700071	3705974	And then, I don't know, just utterly stopped supporting it because you haven't really released any sort of bundles.
3706374	3711097	Oh, it's because you can't bundle anything with it because it doesn't have a UMD drive to play the games that would be bundled with it.
3712157	3712758	Ah, fun.
3712778	3715460	You could give a card for a free download.
3715860	3716521	Yeah.
3716761	3717982	Everybody likes cards.
3718422	3722125	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, Thank you for giving me work to do.
3722185	3724047	Now I have to go online and download the title.
3724487	3729671	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, I love how Sony spins failure.
3730852	3732935	That was a good spin of failure, don't you think?
3732995	3742107	Perhaps, perhaps, just maybe it was possibly the fact that the pricing is what ruined it.
3742167	3743148	Just perhaps.
3744568	3760553	I'm not sure we have some analysts we're paying money to look into right now but perhaps let me tell you for free yes that was the issue it was definitely the pricing was the issue pricing for flimsy piece of crap
3761813	3764615	I saw a PSP go on one of those fancy vending machines the other day.
3764635	3765796	It kind of made me laugh a little bit.
3766236	3772840	Well, there was somebody in one of my history classes that had it before class, and I said, okay, you've got to let me see that.
3773741	3776723	I tried playing it a little bit, and I was like... That mic is not your friend right now.
3777023	3777243	What?
3777644	3778905	I'm holding it together.
3779085	3780706	I'm just saying, it's cutting in and out.
3781466	3783808	I don't write the rules of electronics.
3783888	3785469	I just tell you what it is.
3787273	3787513	Rob.
3787973	3788193	Yes?
3789534	3790895	Person in your electronics class.
3792236	3799639	At any rate, I got to play one because a guy in one of my history classes was playing one and I said, you gotta let me try it.
3800039	3801600	I was like, yeah, piece of crap.
3802100	3808163	I'm sorry, you're not going to appreciate this, but I know we're talking about the PSP Go right now and it really smells like Shermie took a caca.
3808203	3809944	Like, is it just me that smells that?
3810765	3811885	She went go.
3813586	3815107	I want to see if she really did take a caca.
3822136	3825997	Your cat has impeccable comic timing, I just want to say.
3827377	3829077	I don't think DarkSakura appreciates that.
3832478	3835159	I don't think we're allowed to talk about the PSP Go anymore.
3842748	3849112	And what stinks is that DarkSakura has the next story, so we'll just sit here and think about that for a moment.
3851633	3851914	Hi.
3853775	3854415	Poopy butt.
3855796	3857017	Is that right, Mike?
3857077	3858438	I have to say this.
3858738	3866322	For the amount of stink that comes out of that cat's ass, her poop, her little poop, was about the size of an Ikea meatball.
3869093	3870714	Thank you for that comparison.
3870994	3873116	Swedish meatballs will never be the same.
3873216	3878340	That means that she couldn't even give a full-sized cat crap about the PSP Go.
3879260	3880061	I love my cat.
3880902	3883644	And she's sitting under the pinball table like, mm-hmm, I did it.
3885705	3887086	A little sassy fat butt.
3892896	3895498	So, Need for Speed MMO, have you played it?
3896639	3897179	I haven't.
3897699	3898340	Dan plays it.
3898560	3898840	Yeah?
3899140	3902583	He actually really likes it, but you can only get up to level 10 before you have to actually pay for it.
3902703	3903863	Duh.
3903944	3911769	But not anymore, because Need for Speed World, once it hit 1 million registered users, it actually is now free to play.
3912149	3912649	No more charge.
3913690	3919414	But, you still have to buy boosts and double XP bonuses and that type of thing.
3921084	3925911	So, I hate the word, the combination microtransaction.
3925931	3926993	I just think it's stupid.
3927554	3930278	A transaction is a transaction.
3930658	3933082	I'm just saying all those media sites use it.
3933102	3933282	I know.
3933302	3934424	It's just kind of one of those things.
3934684	3935405	And they're all stupid.
3936226	3936427	Okay.
3939534	3942595	Oh, and it's like the gods above just pulled the cord on your mic.
3944516	3947077	Sony dislikes your comments about their transactions.
3947137	3949738	A transaction is a transaction.
3950118	3952199	They should just call it payment.
3953440	3954880	You have to pay for this stuff.
3955501	3956481	Money is money.
3957161	3958582	A little money is still money.
3960057	3961238	and I'll see you next time.
3973727	3977090	It gives you points for how many cops get injured, I guess.
3977771	3977831	Wow.
3977851	3982535	Which is kind of wrong, but, you know, it's actually pretty cool.
3982936	3988601	I think they have just a couple of cars that you can pick from right now, at least at the level that he's at.
3988681	3994667	But it's like playing Need for Speed on the system, except you just truck all over the town on your computer.
3995543	3996003	He likes it.
3996724	4002148	He says that he would rather play it with a wheel than use the keyboard like he's been doing.
4002168	4002829	I can't imagine.
4002849	4003929	The keys are going to stink.
4003970	4005991	Maybe a 360 controller would work better, though.
4006331	4006612	Maybe.
4006672	4007492	A little better than the keys.
4008333	4010975	Zbun, our chatroom, says, You guys got to get a new mic for DarkSakura.
4011215	4012916	I hope it's not the mic.
4012956	4014538	That's the newest mic in the studio.
4015018	4017060	It's probably the cord, not the mic.
4017160	4021743	Something maybe happened where the mic fell or something and shorted one of the wires.
4021803	4022464	I don't know, but it's...
4023044	4023945	It's something to do with that connection.
4023965	4025006	It slides out just a little bit.
4025147	4027209	I think that I just need to get a new mic cable.
4027789	4028790	Yeah, hopefully that's it.
4028871	4031694	Or we could take the mic cable from a working mic.
4032214	4032935	That might be the solution.
4032955	4034457	That one's not detachable.
4034577	4035037	No, yeah, it is.
4035678	4036078	At the bottom.
4036659	4038381	Maybe we could try that during the break and see if that works.
4038401	4038881	That's fine.
4038921	4039402	I can hold it.
4040223	4041224	I can hold it!
4041304	4042445	I'm a big girl!
4044349	4045911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4061665	4062265	Oh yeah!
4062405	4063106	Halo Reach.
4063166	4063566	That's right.
4063586	4066066	That's out this week on the Xbox 360.
4066646	4069187	And now here's everything else that doesn't really matter.
4069667	4072688	Professor Layton and the Unwound Future comes out today.
4073688	4074608	That's on the DS.
4074768	4078269	Dawn of Heroes coming out on the DS as well this week.
4078749	4080289	Deal or No Deal Special Edition.
4080349	4081209	What's special about it?
4081269	4084170	Well, they updated some of the games so it's more like the TV show is now.
4084450	4085810	Other than that, it's not that special.
4086270	4088331	That will be out on the Wii this week as well.
4089511	4091413	Deer Drive on the Nintendo DS.
4091513	4093534	Now you can hunt deer on your DS.
4093694	4094715	That's exciting, I guess.
4096496	4097096	Damn deer.
4097376	4098217	Damn you, deer.
4099458	4103620	Painkiller Pandemonium on PC out this week.
4104661	4105422	Fancy Nancy.
4105442	4110245	Is that like Rush Limbaugh and other pill-addicted celebrities?
4110525	4111846	It's a Doom clone.
4112706	4117031	Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time on the DS Really?
4117411	4119374	Really Can you say that one more time?
4119614	4129725	Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time Fancy Nancy Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time What the hell do you do in Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time?
4129745	4131407	Well, I'm glad you asked
4133553	4134093	Well, let's see.
4134153	4141636	Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time is so awesome that it doesn't deserve either a high-res box shot or a synopsis.
4141716	4146418	But if you want to remember, I believe that you have to... Oh, they're about books.
4146518	4147138	Hold on, hold on.
4147158	4148138	There's a trailer here.
4148299	4148639	Let's see.
4148779	4150479	Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time.
4150519	4151620	Let's look here at a trailer.
4152400	4154661	Again, watching videos with the radio listeners.
4154761	4155421	Always a good time.
4156261	4156842	Let's see here.
4159338	4160379	She is pretty Nancy.
4160899	4167063	In five short years, Fancy Nancy has enchanted the hearts and wardrobes of girls all over the world.
4168383	4176768	With over 25 books and more than 10 million copies sold, Nancy adorns the New York Times bestseller list for over 200 weeks.
4177209	4179430	So far, no mention of a video game, just saying.
4179690	4181071	I wouldn't let my girl read that.
4181551	4183793	And the party is just getting started.
4184273	4185674	Would you let your girl read Twilight?
4186488	4186889	Hell no!
4187389	4192536	But she could be glamorous, extravagant, and posh.
4196846	4205088	I would rather her be intelligent, confident, and not having to conform to anything like that.
4222332	4223095	I found a tea set, I bet it's terrific
4229144	4231105	Well, if you're going to throw a tea party, you need a tea sack.
4231125	4232767	It better damn be terrific.
4233928	4234768	You're fired.
4235309	4244375	Travel the neighborhood and put the party pieces together for the most fabulous, most marvelous, most spectacular soiree you can create.
4244815	4247798	It is fabulous decor and accessories.
4248258	4249639	A plethora of puzzles.
4249679	4250920	This trailer goes on way too long.
4250940	4251721	Wait, cheese is a big word.
4251781	4252261	This game is.
4252521	4253963	I know, she said Plethora.
4254023	4254383	She did.
4254503	4256785	Okay, I'm a little more impressed, but other than that, no.
4257686	4259248	An abundance of fun.
4259448	4260469	Fancy Nancy.
4260729	4263552	Now on your Nintendo DS and DSi.
4264033	4265074	RSVP today.
4266755	4268998	Will you be attending Fancy Nancy's tea party?
4269778	4271500	We should send out an invite on Facebook.
4272561	4274183	No, I will not.
4275800	4276221	Uh, yeah.
4276702	4277764	So that's on DS.
4277865	4281112	Gamer Girl in chat says, the tea is laced with marijuana.
4281853	4282795	That's a game I'd play.
4287288	4289389	Maui Waui's Tea Party.
4289429	4292130	Frisbee says Fancy Nancy in the Meth Lab.
4293050	4304494	If you feel like killing something after hearing that trailer, Cabela's North American Adventure will be out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and PSP, maybe the DS.
4305634	4306015	I don't know.
4307115	4308415	It's out on a lot of systems.
4308455	4309216	You hunt stuff.
4309516	4310136	Everybody loves it.
4310413	4315455	Salacious Pop wants to know if Fancy Nancy Fucked Your Man is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.
4316436	4318397	Dark Tetsuya says Harold and Kumar's Tea Party.
4320218	4323899	Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Swamp out on the Wii and the DS.
4324439	4328081	And I believe the PSP, maybe the PlayStation 2.
4328681	4329062	Who cares?
4329122	4329562	It sucks.
4329762	4332203	Frisbee's suggesting Fancy Nancy and the Meth Lab.
4332223	4333944	That's what I said.
4333964	4336125	That's what she's really gathering the supplies for.
4336285	4336845	I said that one.
4337045	4338106	I thought you said Dark Tetsuya.
4338126	4338346	Sorry.
4339771	4340751	Truth or Lies.
4340831	4351915	It's a game on the PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii where apparently you are challenged to lie to your friends, I guess.
4352015	4353816	I don't really know what the hell the point of this is.
4354956	4356277	Bring the party into your living room.
4356297	4362339	Inspire hilarious discussions and learn about your friends as deep, dark secrets are revealed.
4362399	4365580	It's time to uncover who's telling the truth and who is flat out lying.
4366740	4370142	I'm guessing that it has some sort of way to tell if you're a liar or not.
4370923	4371243	Maybe.
4371563	4372764	Otherwise, this game is lame.
4375846	4378447	AkumaJP suggests Fancy Nancy's happy ending.
4381749	4383170	Fancy Nancy's handjob?
4384211	4385692	Or fancy handjob, I guess.
4388234	4394840	Legends of the Guardian, Owls of Gahool coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this week.
4395301	4397563	The tie-in with the brand new animated movie.
4398123	4402788	Phineas and Ferb, right again on the DS if you like that cartoon series, I guess.
4405230	4406811	DarkSakura's like yelling from the other room.
4407532	4407732	What?
4408793	4410094	I freaking love Phineas and Ferb.
4410435	4411556	That show is crack.
4412396	4412997	I would play a game.
4415661	4419624	and she has sipped the Disney Kool-Aid.
4421325	4424046	Rocket Sports coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.
4424066	4427128	This is very similar to the game that was out on the Wii.
4428485	4429565	It's like Wii Sports.
4430265	4437827	Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest on the PlayStation 2, the PS3, the Wii, the DS, and the PSP.
4437887	4442188	Of course, the PS3 version works with the PlayStation Move and is equally lame.
4444209	4446149	Gladiator Begins.
4446609	4451871	Not a prequel to the Gladiator movie, but it is a Gladiator combat game.
4451891	4454531	There are a lot of games I don't care about coming out this week.
4454571	4456392	Me too, and I'm covering all of them.
4457092	4459954	Alpha and Omega, it's a DS game based on a new animated movie.
4459974	4462536	Whatever end, Jesus, this US release has been going on for like an hour.
4462836	4464697	Halo Reach comes out this week.
4465798	4468960	Hey, Halo Reach is a mature game.
4469000	4472282	There are a lot of immature games out there.
4472543	4476225	Chat room, quick poll, Halo Reach or Fancy Nancy?
4477226	4478046	Please let me know.
4478166	4481769	I will have you know that this is the second time that a Halo game has come out against Cabela's.
4482069	4483650	Maybe this year Cabela's will take it.
4484330	4484931	You never know.
4487768	4488491	Anyways.
4490417	4492524	Oh, and the Cabela's did have a version with a gun for the Wii.
4493999	4495380	Alright, I'm almost done.
4496200	4499502	Gormady, the Lords of Nature coming from Konami on the Wii and the DS.
4499542	4500923	I don't even know what that is, nor do I care.
4502804	4503485	Yu-Gi-Oh!
4504005	4506547	50's Duel Transfer on the Wii.
4507527	4507868	Yay.
4508908	4512611	Of course, the Halo Reach will be out in the Legendary and Limited Editions as well.
4513171	4514572	A Game Called Swords on the Wii.
4514592	4516593	I wonder what you do in that.
4517373	4519795	That's a tough one there.
4524940	4548789	Fancy Nancy or Halo Reach Fancy Nancy Milfhouse Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club Halo Reach Fancy Nancy Reach Fancy Nancy Reach This is sad, it's split 50-50 Fancy Halo Reach Fancy Nancy Reach Around I'd much rather have Fancy Nancy Reach Fancy Nancy download content for Halo Reach I almost said Hello Reach Fancy Nancy Reach
4549409	4555934	Fancy Nancy's Pap Smear, Fancy Nancy Please, more like Halo Reach Around, etc.
4556034	4556834	It's half and half.
4557515	4558716	I don't know what to think about that.
4560737	4561658	Well, I don't know.
4561958	4562839	And two last things.
4563239	4565020	The Phantasy Star Portable on the PSP.
4565521	4571145	And finally, it's not really a game, but it's coming out this week, the PlayStation Move and all the wonderful components for that.
4572180	4588669	and a goddamn thing on this website says that their stupid sports champions or whatever game is out despite the douchebag in the GameStop saying, well, it doesn't come out until the 17th.
4588709	4591270	Yeah, the bundle doesn't come out until the 17th, you idiot.
4592851	4593131	That's it.
4593171	4593511	Are you done?
4593792	4594252	Are you finished?
4594432	4594772	I'm done.
4594832	4595312	Are you finished?
4595472	4595833	Are you sure?
4595853	4595953	Okay.
4597759	4598340	XBOX 360 PlayStation 3
4614597	4618800	See, I don't know, is Halo Reach as big of a deal overseas as it is here?
4619100	4622522	I would think it's still like... Depends on the territory.
4622722	4625564	It's like a B game, but not like an A game, you know?
4625664	4627365	It's still, it's up there, but not like way up there.
4627965	4635030	PlayStation 3, Front Mission Evolved is there as well, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam Senkei Record UC0081.
4635090	4636451	That's just a price reduction, though.
4636591	4638032	That game's actually already been out.
4638912	4643254	Moving over to the Nintendo Wii and seeing what glorious games they're getting over there in Japan.
4644214	4646795	Let's see, DECA Sports 3 is this week.
4646875	4648015	Wii to Sports 10.
4648355	4651856	Shumoku comes out this week in the pretty popular DECA Sports series.
4651896	4653537	That series does pretty well for Hudson, doesn't it?
4654137	4655598	It's like Wii Sports never dies.
4657659	4660621	Nothing really notable on the PlayStation 2, but I do have the Nintendo DS.
4660761	4662602	Jinsai Game QDS.
4662622	4664943	Heisei no Dekigoto.
4665004	4667545	That is also a price reduction that's moving into the best.
4667986	4669426	Otherwise, not a lot of new games this week.
4669487	4672969	Although on the 18th, there's all these new covers coming out.
4673089	4677392	If you want to get covers for your DSi in different colors, you have that to look forward to.
4677412	4678893	Ooh, this ought to be good, though.
4678933	4680754	On the Sony PSP, here's a big week.
4681274	4682275	Yu-Gi-Oh!
4682335	4685377	5D's Tag Force 5, because I know there's some closet Yu-Gi-Oh!
4685417	4686018	fans out there.
4686858	4716450	Dissida Final Fantasy Universal Tuning is ultimate hits so Square sometimes does this with their games they put out like kind of like an international version later on I'm assuming it's kind of this version of this also a game called Blue Roses Yosai To Aoi Hitomi no Senshitashi comes out this week and I think I think that's a hold on it's Blue Roses it's a strategy game I was looking at the title oh sorry it's it's an RPG pretty much
4719344	4722246	This game's from Nipponichi Entertainment, who makes a lot of the games.
4722286	4725847	Just looks like your typical Japanese RPG, honestly, with your little anime cutscenes.
4726028	4726548	It looks cute.
4726608	4727048	Looks cute.
4727068	4728929	I'm sure there'll be some people who want to import that.
4729409	4730630	That's it for Japanese releases.
4730710	4731831	How about the Old Kingdom?
4732411	4734392	Oh, we have a number of things over there.
4735813	4741416	Starting on the 14th, Halo Reach, and then Legend of the Guardians, The Owls of Gahool.
4742316	4744837	That's not from that book that was that movie, right?
4745258	4746018	A book and a movie, yeah.
4747057	4759991	Scooby-Doo in the Spooky Swamp, Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions, Flight Control, Kung Fu Rider, PlayStation Move, Sonic Adventure, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Sports Champions, and Start the Party.
4767999	4776314	And closing up the week on the 17th, we have Lionheart King's Crusade on PC, R.U.S.E., and Two Worlds 2.
4777196	4781203	Of course, there's a game coming out next week that totally makes me laugh by the name Deathspank.
4782736	4783237	That's funny.
4783857	4784057	Nice.
4785758	4787099	Quick question from your chat room.
4787139	4789601	Spyro's asking, what about Final Fantasy XIV?
4791042	4793404	I believe it's out in two weeks on the PC.
4793484	4794264	The end of the month.
4794404	4799127	Yeah, and my list for Japanese releases doesn't cover the PC, so I'm not sure when it's coming out of there.
4799187	4804231	PlayStation 3 is not until next year, and I think that's the same, be it Japan or the US.
4804291	4806172	I think PC's getting the first crack at that.
4806792	4808954	And Collector's Edition is, what, the 22nd?
4809734	4811195	I think regular people get in on the 30th.
4812817	4814759	I'm a little skeptical about Final Fantasy XIV.
4814879	4815200	I don't know.
4815680	4816441	I'm weird though.
4817202	4818523	I feel like I need to buy it.
4819511	4842804	I need to give the retail game a good old fashioned college try I need to try it and see what I really think of it but then again I'm like oh wow but that beta was so bad but I don't know I'm really torn that's where I'm at we'll see to be continued it really depends probably like do I have money to spend on Final Fantasy 14 or not that's really what it's going to come down to probably
4844522	4849174	Alright, let's move on with some other news and we'll get to the classic game of the week here in just a little bit here on the show.
4849255	4849515	Loki.
4850698	4851160	Ah, yes.
4851641	4852242	Um, so...
4853723	4854864	It's kind of interesting.
4855845	4864210	For the longest time, I remember Apple was so adamant about not supporting Flash in their applications.
4864391	4866832	Well, that may change soon, actually.
4866872	4878380	They're going to relax some of the iOS development restrictions, including the use now of third-party tools like Flash CS5.
4879581	4883303	So, apparently, you know, new apps now can be developed with that in mind.
4884743	4885544	That's kind of cool.
4885804	4889906	So, maybe, I don't know, we'll get some more apps that way.
4889986	4891366	Maybe a better web browser.
4892187	4893787	Does that mean it's easier to make apps now?
4893807	4899610	Because, you know, people have been asking for an OLR app for forever and I just... Yeah, if you know Flash, I guess it could...
4899930	4900890	I can think of a few things
4915356	4916017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4940151	4941972	DarkTouchStudio is suggesting an OLR and USL combined soundboard.
4963104	4964064	Alright, moving on.
4964785	4965145	Let's see.
4965345	4965985	Oh, I like this.
4967226	4970767	Oh, and TigerClock confirms the All Games app is still not back on the App Store.
4971227	4975489	Well, maybe we need to put an app up there just so that there's something to tune into the radio show on the go.
4975529	4975849	I don't know.
4976209	4977890	Although I think Video Game Outsiders have one.
4978810	4979750	And that show's plenty fine.
4979790	4980611	I like what they do over there.
4982251	4982831	Mario.
4983211	4984972	It's a hacky Mario game.
4985012	4985312	Not really.
4985332	4986712	More like a homebrew Mario game.
4987492	4988733	It's created by Ben Weber.
4988813	4991413	He's a candidate for his PhD in computer science.
4991453	4992653	He goes to UC Santa Cruz.
4993114	4997054	He's programmed a game, and it uses sprites from Super Mario World.
4997074	4998115	So you could say it's homebrew.
4998695	5003236	But what this game does is it's called Infinite Adaptive Mario.
5003816	5006436	And the level starts with moderate difficulty.
5006916	5009277	But once you beat that, the next level gets harder.
5009817	5011818	And by the way, harder means yes, it gets a lot harder.
5011838	5014479	According to Weber, quote, So in other words, as you get smarter, so does the game.
5036764	5044504	And in some cases, if you look at some of these screenshots, there's like 16 monsters on the screen at once, including piranha plants that just fly in midair.
5044945	5046108	That seems really hard.
5046613	5047453	That looks crazy.
5047493	5048294	I was looking at it.
5048474	5055477	The author put Infinite Adaptive Mario up against an AI program that completes randomly generated Mario levels.
5056797	5058698	And there's this whole YouTube on how that goes.
5058718	5060199	That sounds kind of interesting, actually.
5060839	5067422	You can download it on the website for UC Santa Cruz, but it is a little bit buggy.
5068642	5094505	but that's kind of interesting although I kind of think has a Nintendo gone that direction a little bit like games don't get harder necessarily but didn't they put in that controversial quote-unquote system a little while back where the levels get easier or I guess the tutorials Luigi tutorials come up if you're screwing up like wasn't that in it was in the Mario versus game the new Super Mario Brothers Wii if you die like eight times in a level then you get the Luigi tutorial kind of interesting huh
5096324	5098185	You suck, so we're going to teach you not to suck.
5098305	5099727	Yes, exactly.
5101688	5102769	Loki, you're playing that right now?
5104030	5104791	I see you over there.
5104831	5105892	You're playing it right now, aren't you?
5107053	5107574	I think he is.
5107774	5111537	I was going to, yeah, except they don't tell you what the buttons are, which makes it difficult.
5111777	5112798	That might be kind of difficult.
5113899	5118003	All right, hey, let's get to the classic game of the week.
5118063	5121446	It's a segment here on the show where we take a trip down memory lane...
5123422	5130068	with the help of DarkSakura and her gaming vault to say, hey, here's a video game you little brats should be playing this week.
5130748	5132790	And it's not Mario this week, unfortunately.
5132830	5133731	It's not related to this.
5133751	5135672	But it is pretty cool, right, DarkSakura?
5135752	5136393	Ice Cream Man?
5138094	5138855	Oh, yeah, the Ice Cream Man.
5138875	5139756	The Ice Cream Man's outside.
5139776	5140697	I can't do the segment.
5140717	5140957	Bye.
5141357	5141737	No, I'm kidding.
5143639	5143879	Okay.
5145180	5146461	Yes, the classic game of the week is?
5147062	5147662	Moonwalker.
5148703	5150705	Specifically, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.
5151067	5154511	Because, you know, not to be confused with Paula Abdul's Moonwalker.
5154611	5156392	But I wanted to start off on the arcade version.
5159356	5165222	Because the arcade version is... It's been hard to find lately, and it's different, of course, than the one we all remember on Genesis.
5165922	5168465	Which I think is pretty cool.
5169986	5171648	At any rate, going with the arcade version...
5173843	5180027	You start off on sort of a... It's technically side-scrolling, but it goes diagonally.
5180947	5183929	And you... It is a beat-em-up.
5184009	5187451	You have magic powers to attack with instead of actually just punching them.
5187591	5189132	And you can shoot magic at them.
5190112	5195295	And you can also turn into the big robot from... Which is the best thing ever.
5196136	5196396	Yeah.
5197737	5198077	Just saying.
5198738	5204202	And the player one is Michael in the white suit and hat with the blue shirt.
5204282	5207785	And then second player is red with white.
5208065	5209806	And the third one is black with red.
5210307	5214510	And they all have those armands that Michael Jackson is going to be really fond of.
5216391	5218853	Did you hear Michael's little scream there in between stages?
5219534	5220074	Wow!
5220554	5221295	Hold on one more time.
5221515	5222676	Wait, let me run this back a little bit.
5223737	5239803	he saves the kid, he goes in the door and then there's a cutscene round two, amusement quarter here we go although I love this little version of Smooth Criminal that plays in the background let's listen to a little bit of it
5252075	5252416	Anyway.
5254057	5260541	Of course, he's got the dance magic, which is sort of, I guess, the smart bomb for the game.
5261542	5276031	And basically, you all get this sort of on-screen logo that you can activate, and then a spotlight lands on you, and you start to dance like regular Michael Jackson moves.
5276572	5279274	And then all the enemies on the screen start dancing with you.
5280974	5282515	One of his power-ups is Bubbles the Chimpanzee.
5302897	5309163	Bubbles is in each level and every time you rescue him, he turns you into the giant robot.
5309883	5311324	And then you can shoot lasers.
5313246	5321113	Now for the console, of course this is what I'm sure people remember a lot more of, is the one that came out on the Genesis.
5322822	5349630	and I like this one because when you go and do the dance magic thing when you're standing on the piano everyone does the whole smooth criminal dance and that was just sweet but that one was pretty cool and to go back to the songs that were in the game for the arcade version the cavern one was bad and the amusement quarter is smooth criminal the night street is beat it graveyard is another part of me and the evil fortress is another version of bad and then Billie Jean plays in the credits
5350830	5355072	and then on the Sega Genesis one, which is more standard side-scroller.
5356492	5375240	Stage one is Smooth Criminal, stage two is Beat It, stage three is Another Part of Me, stage four is Billie Jean, and then you can perform part of Bad, and then stage five is Bad with your special performance being Smooth Criminal, Beat It, Thriller, if you have the REV00 version, or Another Part of Me, which is the REV01.
5376620	5382382	and he shouts woo and in some of the cutscenes he says who's bad?
5384683	5405292	but he says his usual little catchphrases but for the ad for the Sega Genesis version it said that Thriller was supposed to be in the game but it wasn't it's just the dance attack that's in that one version in the last stage
5406821	5411124	And of course, this isn't the only game that Michael Jackson has made appearances in.
5412124	5414906	There was Space Channel 5 and Space Channel 5 Part 2.
5415686	5418108	And he was a secret character in Ready to Rumble Boxing Round 2.
5419529	5422050	So, uh... That's pretty cool.
5424111	5425012	But there was, um...
5427049	5433713	Also, did you know that they were working on a Michael Jackson The Experience game to be out on Xbox 360?
5433973	5435935	Yes, it's coming out.
5435995	5438096	It was going to be out later this year, but I think it got pushed back.
5438336	5439157	Next year, yeah.
5439217	5441178	It better be just like Moonwalker.
5442023	5444045	I think it's supposed to be just like, just dance.
5444685	5445486	It's singing in it.
5446547	5447028	Not bad.
5447828	5457757	The game actually has a rating on, the PEGI has a rating for Wii's Virtual Console, so there's a talk that it should be out in Europe.
5458858	5459499	So that's pretty cool.
5461380	5461861	Cool game.
5461881	5463042	Alright.
5463062	5463242	Alright.
5463607	5466709	I don't care if people say it sucks, I completely disagree, it's fun.
5466729	5467609	No, it was a cool arcade game.
5467629	5467950	Yeah.
5468030	5468490	It was cool.
5468610	5471232	On the Genesis it was a little wonky, but it was, you know, it was Michael Jackson.
5472232	5472953	Didn't have to be that good.
5472973	5474153	It's all about the dance.
5474273	5476715	But the best Michael Jackson game is Space Channel 5 Part 2.
5477455	5479877	Oh yeah, especially when you break out into the whole thriller dance.
5480337	5481217	Oh, that was awesome.
5481278	5481658	Absolutely.
5481678	5488642	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker for the arcade, although Dark Sakura did reference the Genesis version as well.
5489443	5492784	So that's going to do it for part A of our program, but it's not over yet, guys.
5492804	5494005	We've got plenty more show to come.
5494065	5497846	Your phone calls, your emails, rapid-fire news, and the tweets on Twitter.
5498306	5506409	Talk of Guitar Hero invading the Twitters, and Rock Band 3 information, and a new character confirmed for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 this week.
5506709	5510590	We're going to talk about all of that when we come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5517182	5519784	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5519824	5524989	It is episode number 381, live on this Sunday evening, September the 12th of 2010.
5526450	5534897	We are live, of course, at All Games Radio, where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
5534957	5536919	Although, next week, he's not going to be here.
5537299	5538160	Sad.
5538720	5541503	So, it'll just be us next Sunday holding down the fort.
5541783	5542583	But you know what that means?
5543244	5545346	We can take over the stream early if we want.
5545366	5545426	Woo!
5546436	5548997	We could take over the stream early and then go to bed early.
5549057	5551838	Bobby assured me that there's no best of or anything next week.
5551958	5555099	And the chatters are requesting another marathon.
5555339	5555619	Okay.
5556139	5557499	No, are you crazy?
5558040	5558360	Yeah.
5559520	5560720	We're not doing another marathon.
5561201	5562101	I'll go live early though.
5562181	5564081	I'll go live early.
5564141	5564962	You can do a marathon.
5565022	5569243	You can broadcast all day long and then I'll come in at 6 o'clock as will Loki.
5570798	5571800	Alan may be here next week.
5571820	5572281	I'm not sure.
5572681	5572941	Okay.
5573182	5573482	All right.
5574424	5578209	You'll be coming in right in the middle of the rebirth of Pump Up the Volume.
5581035	5581575	Good times.
5582176	5582656	All right, we'll see.
5582876	5583317	Maybe.
5584257	5586579	On our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
5587059	5587519	Ranma Deer?
5588100	5588340	Hush.
5588520	5590361	They're already asking for an OLR-thon too.
5590381	5590782	No, no, no.
5591302	5591822	Too much.
5592483	5594444	If you do it too much, then it loses its effect.
5594504	5596545	It needs to stay like a once a year type of thing.
5597246	5600528	Of course, then again, the show as it is has already been going, what, eight and a half years?
5600588	5603890	So if we even make it another year, that in itself is something to celebrate.
5603950	5604671	So that'll be good.
5605011	5606072	Think we'll make it to 10 years?
5606292	5606952	That's a long time.
5607493	5607913	That'll be good.
5607973	5608313	Why not?
5608333	5609254	It's only two more years.
5610037	5611578	Not even two more whole years.
5611718	5612118	I know.
5612258	5613399	We might make it to ten years.
5613419	5614439	Ooh, coffee.
5615040	5615620	You have coffee?
5616961	5617861	Nescafe, do you want some?
5618061	5618662	Is it decaf?
5618702	5618882	Yes.
5620363	5620763	It's good.
5620983	5622304	Alright, I'll try some.
5622424	5622884	Fine!
5622924	5623564	Freaking decaf.
5623584	5625565	I don't have any creamer to put in it except for rice milk.
5626286	5627086	I don't know if I have any left.
5627146	5627426	That's okay.
5629255	5629976	Woot, I'm getting coffee
5653876	5660839	Um, I could see that happening, and I doubt that they would make up stuff, so, um, it's possible.
5661159	5664721	I bet we'd see it come out around the same time as The Last Guardian, so, um.
5666417	5667097	Frank West Johnny Pipes
5694063	5696825	recount seeing someone else fighting by green side.
5696925	5698586	So I go after him, he says.
5699627	5700928	But then I see some other dude.
5701548	5702769	Vaguely recognized him.
5702809	5704870	Maybe saw him at a party a few years back.
5704910	5705711	Maybe a celebrity.
5705731	5706912	Can't remember his name, though.
5707552	5708353	Phil Floyd.
5708393	5711735	Regardless, he was fighting zombies, too.
5711855	5716218	It was like Oktoberfest, but replaced a beer with zombies and drinking with slaughter.
5716578	5718679	It was like I died and gone to heaven.
5719780	5719880	Um...
5721301	5742485	and of course I believe in one of the screenshots or they have these like photos or whatever um I thought I saw Frank West actually in there yes he is actually in that photo so I think it's inevitable he has to make a cameo somewhere in the game you know what I mean like he's got to be in it or people are just gonna be pissed you know and also there's two-player co-op
5743827	5745308	Oh, they haven't said what the second player is?
5745588	5746629	Nope.
5746809	5752173	In the demos it's been just you played another Chuck Green, but perhaps Frank West.
5752273	5754734	Perhaps they'll charge you 500 points as DLC.
5754894	5762939	Perhaps they will have like a second, you know, the second quest as you like to put it, where you can play as Frank West.
5765301	5767783	I think more games need second quests.
5768523	5769944	Like the original Legend of Zelda.
5769964	5771925	Ooh, that's a hot, hot, hot, ow, that's a hot cup.
5772726	5772806	Um,
5774437	5779979	Console modder Ben Heck is getting his own show starting September 13th.
5780419	5792044	You may remember him from such wonderful console mods as the Atari 2600 Portable and all the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 laptops he's made.
5792784	5796445	He does a lot of modding for different game controllers and whatnot.
5797145	5798526	But he will have his own show.
5798586	5803228	It's going to appear on apparently an internet TV channel called Revision3.
5805598	5809081	and I guess... Isn't that the one that does all the dig shows, I think?
5809802	5812644	Maybe, and it's also going to be hosted on Element 14.
5812744	5816607	So, it's interesting.
5816768	5818149	Will it be on actual television?
5818709	5819110	Don't know.
5819470	5819910	Should, though.
5820411	5820991	I think it should.
5821752	5822853	It'll be on Apple TV.
5822893	5823613	That's where it'll be.
5826176	5827236	Did the cat poop again?
5827256	5831940	No, I found where she really pooped.
5831960	5833522	DarkSakura just found a surprise.
5836075	5837737	Dissida Dissida Dissida
5854096	5855457	and Duodecim.
5855817	5856958	I guess that's how you pronounce it.
5857018	5857978	It's all Latin-y words.
5858439	5863001	Yes, it is in the issue of Shonen Jump, which is one of those magazines overseas.
5863402	5865203	It's a sequel to Dissida Final Fantasy.
5865223	5867564	It will be coming out on Japanese PSPs in 2011.
5868225	5870986	Dissida Duodecim Final Fantasy.
5871827	5878391	We don't know any new characters yet except for Final Fantasy IV's Kain and Final Fantasy XIII's Lightning.
5878911	5879511	That'll be cool.
5879851	5884013	No other players have been confirmed yet, but I imagine most of the roster from the first disc of the game.
5884554	5888035	I know a lot of my friends were big fans of this game, so I'm sure they're going to be excited about that.
5888115	5889576	More news on that when we know it.
5890136	5897259	Meanwhile, for you Mac gamers, and I know there are some of you, you missed out on Grand Theft Auto 3 when it was the shit.
5897419	5899160	Well, miss out on this no more.
5899220	5904382	Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas, a big pack of games is coming out later this year.
5904822	5908244	That is confirmed from Rockstar's Facebook for the Mac.
5908784	5913808	No date yet or anything like that, but for you Mac gamers who missed out on that, I'm sure you're excited.
5914569	5920333	And I know DarkSakura is going to be first in line for one of these on September 21st for the low, low price of $54.99, a pink DualShock 3.
5920373	5920433	Yay!
5928790	5930712	I think I like cleaning up Shermie's poop better.
5955569	5955990	Need.
5956250	5956530	Rob.
5956590	5957130	Must have.
5957211	5958531	There's something other than that coming out.
5958692	5959952	Something I covered for Geek Life.
5960012	5960853	Plug, plug, plug.
5961173	5962134	Geek-life.com.
5962214	5963635	Oh, the collector's edition with the bike?
5964195	5964455	No.
5964876	5968738	There's a keyboard and mouse coming out that has the blue lighting on it.
5969379	5973462	And the mouse is like one of those super nice cushioned ergonomic really happy mice.
5973482	5975643	I am such a consumer whore because I want all of it.
5976184	5976764	I really do.
5976864	5978885	I want the little PS3 controller.
5978905	5979366	I want the keyboard.
5979386	5979826	I want the mouse.
5979846	5981587	I want the collector's edition of the game.
5982008	5982528	I'm sad.
5982548	5982688	I'm sad.
5982848	5989533	If anyone wants to read about it, you can go to geek-life.com and look up my Geek Cube article from a couple weeks ago.
5989554	5994157	Oh, the shameless plug alarm is going off.
5995318	5995939	No, it's all good.
5996919	5998621	I will have to go read about that right now.
6000462	6001923	While DarkSakura does some other stories.
6002824	6003665	Ruining my fun, Rob.
6005487	6008789	Well, for a... And this is actually really cool.
6008949	6011069	We were talking about this not too long ago.
6011950	6017212	Borderlands is getting a free update that will raise the level cap and rebalance the game.
6017752	6018253	Ooh.
6018833	6021034	And it's, of course, across all the platforms.
6021514	6023175	Xbox 360, PS3, PC.
6024055	6026336	And this was announced at PAX, by the way.
6027437	6031118	And the download content pack is called Claptrap's New Robot Revolution.
6032099	6032239	And...
6034193	6036874	It's going to be, I think, pretty good.
6037094	6041154	There were some issues with the way the game played.
6041314	6042975	I mean, otherwise it was still really fun.
6043695	6053477	And also, they just said it was going to be the level cap at 69.
6054837	6055257	That's funny.
6055797	6061458	It's going to be out on... It'll be released around October 12th when the Game of the Year edition comes out.
6062578	6066022	KumaJP in chat just said the Xbox is getting one of those Tron controllers too.
6066322	6066723	Damn it!
6067243	6068785	That's another thing I'm going to have to buy now.
6071824	6076948	And then for next week's Rock Band download content, we've got some new stuff.
6077448	6079550	We have Holy Diver by Dio.
6079690	6081591	We have Stand Up and Shout by Dio.
6081991	6084393	We have Nirvana, Juliana Hatfield.
6084933	6086654	I haven't heard any of her stuff in a long time.
6087135	6088196	Wow, she's still around?
6088396	6088976	Making music?
6089536	6091118	I haven't heard her since like college.
6091198	6092879	I think this is an older one.
6093359	6094880	Irish Blood, English Heart by Morrissey.
6096381	6097222	I love Morrissey too.
6097242	6100284	This is totally like my college music.
6100424	6100784	DarkSakura.com
6117718	6120261	This Charming Man by the Smiths.
6120341	6121663	It's also like Morrissey Week.
6122404	6124186	And Writing on the Walls Under Oath.
6124726	6126488	Okay, I might have to get some points.
6127389	6129572	The list looks pretty awesome to me.
6130913	6132115	Which, of course, are going to be...
6133536	6148769	Now, the dollar amount is really all the same for them, but the Morrissey, the one that's Irish Heart, English Blood, This Charming Man, and Writing on Walls are going to be 160 Microsoft points each, while the others are 200 Wii points.
6148789	6152192	They're all going to be on all the platforms, so.
6153880	6168610	And then, last but not least, this is kind of funny, I think, is that they're putting out a Wiimote that's going to be coinciding with the Wii title, Doctor Who Returned to Earth.
6169811	6173033	It's getting a Sonic Screwdriver Wii controller, and I think that's awesome.
6173293	6177436	It's, of course, based after the current 11th Doctor's...
6179097	6183820	Sonic Screwdriver, which honestly I still think that the best Sonic Screwdriver was 10th, but that's me.
6185261	6193646	But it's also going to have the voices of Matt Smith, who's currently playing the Doctor, and his lovely redhead companion.
6193966	6194786	It's going to be pretty cool.
6196447	6197928	I might have to get that.
6197948	6198889	I hope it comes out over here.
6200610	6200930	It better.
6202851	6203532	It very well might.
6203732	6204152	You never know.
6206229	6216393	By the way, just completely random before we get into the Twitter topic, since DarkSakura brought up Rock Band, I know a friend of mine would be very upset if I did not mention Umlaut is officially announced for this year.
6216433	6216853	Remember this?
6216893	6218434	This is the Rock Band charity night.
6218474	6222355	You play Rock Band on stage, and you pay money to do it, but it's this whole charity thing.
6222375	6222996	It's pretty awesome.
6223436	6225937	December 9th, the date has officially been announced this year.
6225977	6227897	They switched days, if I'm not mistaking.
6227937	6229338	It's not on the same night of the week.
6229358	6233820	I think last year it was on a Monday, and this year it's going to be on a Thursday, so it's moving up.
6234780	6239702	And apparently one of the big things they're doing this year, there's going to be a headliner band that they're going to auction away.
6240122	6240783	That's pretty cool.
6240803	6247725	I'm trying to convince my pal Victoria to do a band where she's going to sing Lady Gaga and we'll call ourselves Victoria and the Gays.
6248346	6249786	I'm really excited about that.
6249826	6252908	So you might have to come out and watch us rock it at Umlaut.
6252928	6256529	But they do an internet stream too, which I want to say was very well trafficked last year.
6256549	6257830	And you can donate to a good cause.
6257870	6260091	It's all for child's play, etc., etc.
6260151	6262812	I will make sure Say gets on the show to talk about this at some point.
6264092	6265533	If he doesn't come on, I will be sad.
6266494	6268275	Moving on, let's get to some Twitter topics.
6268976	6269596	Some tweets.
6270336	6270917	The Twitters.
6272858	6274159	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6274179	6276901	If you want to send us some tweets.
6278622	6280543	Oops, and I just closed them because I'm a genius.
6281724	6282885	I was on the Twitter page.
6283789	6288151	and my fat finger clicked the button and I moved to a new page and now Twitter is giving me the fail whale.
6288171	6288772	That's great.
6289352	6290272	No more Twitter topics.
6290312	6290793	Oh, here we go.
6291473	6298897	SBHale is asking, was going to ask what you guys thought about the Sony Move, but Rob's TwitPic already answered my question.
6299137	6303579	I didn't post a picture of me holding the Move controllers in a provocative manner or anything.
6303899	6307901	Well, let me rephrase the question then for Loki because he already talked about the Sony Move earlier in the show.
6308361	6311503	If you could sum up the Sony Move in three words, Loki, what would they be?
6313911	6314971	Just like Nintendo.
6316732	6316972	Nice.
6319052	6319412	Let's see.
6319492	6321293	Tiger Claw is giving us some links tonight.
6322113	6326114	Steam is launching a beta for the Steam Wallet payment option.
6327374	6329615	Apparently, this is something they're beta testing right now.
6329855	6333296	Instead of using a debit or credit card, you can actually...
6334116	6338919	Use money out of your card and put it in a Steam wallet and then use the money to buy the game.
6339620	6342882	Not sure how this works or why this is practical.
6343202	6352187	I'm assuming it's some type of like middle thing where your parents, like when you're good, will put like $25 in your Steam wallet and then you as the child can spend that on whatever.
6352487	6353608	I'm thinking that's what this is.
6353668	6355349	It's kind of like a fancy gift certificate, eh?
6355930	6358431	That's coming out to Steam, I guess very soon.
6358471	6359712	It's being beta tested right now.
6362179	6365660	Also from Tiger Claw, because I'm nice and allowing two tweets tonight.
6366640	6370721	The Xbox Live murderer was sentenced to two life sentences.
6370901	6374081	Oh, the sad thing is I look at this and I go, which Xbox Live murderer?
6374121	6375762	Because unfortunately there's been a lot of them.
6377122	6381003	Well, a jury convicted, let's see, what's the name of the asshole in this case?
6381023	6384523	23-year-old Derek Lee Hernandez.
6384963	6386604	Two mandatory life sentences.
6386684	6388164	Congratulations, no parole.
6390361	6398567	He killed 22-year-old Jason Hawley, and it was a jury of six men and six women who deliberated over two days, found him guilty.
6399007	6401009	Oh, man.
6401309	6403570	I'm not even going to go into the gritty details about this.
6404291	6407293	Oh, this was the guy he was mentally challenged.
6408153	6436771	and uh the guy kind of took advantage of him remember this this was the judge the judge had said during the trial he wanted to be your friend Mr. Hernandez he would have done whatever you asked him and you took advantage of that you tricked him into coming up to the mountains and there was no other reason than to take his life and yeah it was all this whole like uh that he uh took the 360 from the poor guy it's messed up but it really has nothing to do with games again I hate these like senseless murder things
6437355	6440437	Alright, moving on, moving on, moving on.
6441158	6443760	Blue Swim sending us a tweet.
6445321	6449804	What are your biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation?
6449864	6451345	Great job on the marathon show.
6451546	6451886	Loved it.
6452366	6456009	Biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation from Blue Swim.
6457429	6457729	Anyone?
6458249	6462131	I would say biggest surprise would be LittleBigPlanet in a way.
6462311	6464052	I didn't think I'd like that as much as I did.
6465132	6475537	Biggest disappointment is probably the Xbox Live game shows, 1 versus 100, going away so quickly and without replacement.
6477297	6477577	Anyone?
6477597	6479198	Yeah.
6484304	6487465	I don't really have any major surprises or anything.
6487505	6490306	I mean, LittleBigPlanet, I kind of expected it to do big.
6491347	6495908	I guess I'm kind of surprised about Final Fantasy XIV sucking so bad.
6496949	6498289	So I guess that's a disappointment.
6499510	6500090	Loki, anything?
6501108	6502909	Um, let's see.
6503329	6511373	I would say disappointing would be Nintendo and them grasping online because they really haven't.
6511473	6513774	And I know that they have stuff in their store.
6513794	6522278	In fact, I think the question is we should be posing is when's the last time that we've actually had a virtual console release from them?
6523943	6525684	Oh, oh, I know disappointment.
6525904	6526845	I know the biggest disappointment.
6526885	6527845	PlayStation Home.
6528786	6529786	So much potential.
6530347	6531307	Just down the toilet.
6531767	6542793	And to bounce off of that, I would have to say probably, was it Microsoft's wonderful arcade thing?
6542893	6543293	Game Room.
6543454	6548136	Game Room, yeah.
6548336	6551458	Actdeft in chat says the greatest surprise was Earth Defense Force.
6552870	6555511	which, funny enough, leads into Blue Swim's other tweets.
6556211	6558732	Loki might recognize where Blue Swim's from in a minute here.
6559032	6565654	He says, also, if I got Loki or OLR in hot water with D3 Publisher for the EDF story on CheapAssGamer, I apologize.
6567014	6570795	Just wanted to share the EDF news and hopefully send some new listeners OLR's way in the process.
6570855	6571015	Nah.
6571215	6572337	I know you didn't hear anything.
6572497	6577123	And you didn't send any listeners our way because no one realized that, you know, it was from Orange on the Red.
6577143	6578846	But your blog got a lot of hits.
6578926	6581189	It was CheapAssGamer was the source of that story.
6581209	6583833	Yeah, because clearly they talked about it on their show.
6587190	6589592	No, we don't blame you, Blue Swim.
6589692	6590152	Oh, I know.
6590192	6593195	You're just excited like Loki is about the game.
6594096	6597198	I did add a little something, though.
6598119	6599140	It's not just 360 this time.
6599900	6600160	Oh!
6601161	6603723	Okay.
6603803	6604404	Let's see.
6605044	6609168	DarkKisuke sends us a tweet saying you guys should play Dead Space for a show.
6609308	6610469	Maybe the next marathon show.
6610509	6613191	We don't usually play a lot of games on air while we're trying to do the show.
6613251	6614192	It's a little bit distracting.
6615232	6615733	Ha ha ha!
6616528	6617248	Redertainment.
6617488	6620589	This question might be inappropriate, so ready the inappropriate alarm.
6620829	6622949	DarkSakura, could you ready the inappropriate alarm?
6623730	6623990	Alright.
6624430	6625630	Because this question's for you.
6625830	6627050	There's the inappropriate alarm.
6627791	6631791	Does DarkSakura have a vibrator to compare the PS3 dildo sticks to?
6638653	6638813	No.
6638833	6638873	No.
6640735	6643698	I had to think about it.
6643758	6645420	Her vibrators are uncomparable.
6648840	6649900	No, mine aren't USB.
6650361	6651601	Oh, okay.
6651661	6653142	Spazinator PSN.
6653922	6655003	Oh, this is a good question.
6655083	6656023	I totally forgot about this one.
6656063	6656643	Sends us a tweet.
6657043	6663806	Feel like touching on the whole temporary banning from Xbox Live because some guy lived in Fort Gay, West Virginia.
6664346	6665747	Please tell me you guys heard about this.
6665827	6669128	The guy put in his bio that he lived in Fort Gay, West Virginia.
6669509	6671870	He got banned from Xbox Live.
6672030	6676832	I thought, though, that they were stopping... They weren't banning people from that stuff nowadays.
6678192	6685858	I think when it was looked at, some people thought that he was calling West Virginia gay or something.
6685998	6686558	I don't know.
6686758	6690061	It's not gay, it's Fort Gay, okay?
6690421	6693563	It is a maximum security gay facility.
6693583	6699607	Which coincidentally is going to be the name of the OLR fort that DarkSakura is going to take over someday will be Fort Gay.
6699708	6700308	Fort Gay!
6702470	6702650	No.
6702671	6703572	Because it means happy.
6703873	6704413	Yes, it does.
6704433	6704854	It does.
6704934	6705756	And we'll paint it rainbow.
6706417	6707559	Because everyone loves a rainbow.
6707639	6708059	That's right.
6708080	6709402	Especially a double rainbow.
6710023	6710864	What does it mean?
6710884	6714210	I thought like the fortress of sodomy would...
6716185	6716826	No, that's next door.
6717326	6718467	All right.
6718507	6722731	Look, obviously they're wearing egg on their face over the whole thing.
6723812	6737824	It's an excellent case of the corporate web and how the corporate web allowed that thing to spiral way out of control because there were rules that were set and this guy is saying, hey, I live there.
6738044	6738644	Google it.
6738785	6739865	It's a real place.
6740919	6763950	for you and me that's where it should have ended but unfortunately thanks to corporate webs it didn't end there and caused a nightmare so now Microsoft is going to have to look at their corporate policy to make sure this kind of dumb shit doesn't happen again and Tiger Claw is saying that Microsoft better be careful because there's actually someone who lives in fucking Australia
6764983	6769386	I thought there was a fucking France or something too.
6769426	6771087	I think there's another town called fucking.
6772347	6773188	Fucking Australia.
6773268	6774909	Oh no, it's Austria, not Australia.
6774929	6776210	That's what I get when I read too fast.
6776910	6777911	Fucking Austria.
6779311	6780132	Sorry, Australia.
6780152	6781293	Greatest town ever.
6782673	6785995	That's what I say when I realize Arnold Schwarzenegger really is the governor.
6786135	6786936	Fucking Austria.
6787156	6788497	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6790178	6791659	Alpha Cananogram is sending us a tweet.
6791719	6793540	Choo Choo Rocket is coming back.
6794380	6795101	That's kind of cool.
6795901	6798724	Choo Choo Rocket is on its way out on the iPhone.
6798904	6800286	It's going to be out in October.
6800446	6803969	It might be coming to Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
6804910	6805891	We don't know, but it might be.
6806812	6809174	Apparently it needs enough support on Facebook.
6809814	6811316	It's a big Facebook trend thing.
6812136	6812757	Uh, let's see.
6812897	6817759	DJ Ranma S, Appeals Court ruling threatens used software sales.
6817959	6818279	Uh-oh.
6818880	6819620	I can't be good.
6820180	6822462	He sends us a link here to this news.
6822542	6822982	Let's see.
6823882	6831646	Uh, a federal appeals court has sided with the computer software industry in its effort to squelch sales of second-hand programs covered by widely used licensing agreements.
6832487	6832587	Um...
6834065	6834866	Let's see, I'm looking here.
6835046	6837368	A doctrine refers to a 102-year-old decision by the U.S.
6837388	6845894	Supreme Court that determined copyright holders can't prevent a buyer from reselling or renting a product after an initial sale as long as additional copies aren't made.
6847475	6857863	A three-judge panel in the 9th District concluded that first sale doctrine didn't apply to used software programs that online merchant Timothy Verner peddled in his store on eBay.
6857963	6859564	Oh, this might not be good.
6861687	6863007	I have to read up more on this later.
6863027	6864528	I haven't seen this covered on a lot of sites.
6864628	6867969	We deal with the first sale doctrine all the time.
6867989	6870510	We'll see what the legal mumbo jumbo is that comes of this.
6870530	6873711	This is just like the first of many things.
6874571	6874831	All right.
6876431	6883714	And SSJ100Man on Twitter is saying, Comedy site Zug.com pulled a real-life Lemmings prank in downtown Boston.
6883794	6885014	Oh, this has got to be interesting.
6885074	6886354	Is this like a little video or something?
6887335	6891256	Wow, they actually dressed up in what looks like blue snuggies and green wigs.
6893086	6895368	This is like one of those stupid flash mob things.
6895408	6896509	I'm looking at the thing on YouTube.
6897489	6898530	Yep, so there they go.
6899411	6901252	They're walking into the water and falling in.
6903914	6905816	This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.
6905836	6906897	People are dumb.
6909199	6912001	I love how there's all these college kids in the back that don't even care.
6916405	6917726	Some people have too much time on their hands.
6917766	6918506	But I love the look.
6918546	6920247	I love the Snuggies' outfits.
6920808	6927291	And lastly, Maren Marvel on Twitter is saying, I'm totally guest hosting on OLR on October 1st when Sky is out of town.
6928192	6928572	You should.
6928592	6929412	It'd be fun.
6929512	6931013	Actually, you shouldn't.
6931033	6932274	You should come to Disneyland with me.
6932334	6933755	You know Disneyland is better than this show.
6933855	6934135	Sorry.
6934235	6935256	Just saying.
6935736	6936116	Just saying.
6937057	6938397	That's it for the tweeters tonight.
6938437	6941439	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6941979	6942740	Back to gaming news.
6942800	6943000	Loki.
6944431	6954138	Yes, so speaking of tweets, this is retarded, but I guess the natural progression of stuff.
6955479	6965265	Guitar Hero Warriors Rock will be the first Guitar Hero game, and I can't say this with any less enthusiasm, to integrate Twitter and Facebook.
6965505	6966406	Hurrah!
6967247	6971109	Now everybody can know when you do stuff in this game.
6971970	6973711	Like I give a shit.
6974792	6977034	But, yes, it will be coming.
6977054	6978135	It is confirmed on the Wii.
6978295	6985461	I can tell you right now, based off the presentation that was given to me by the Activision reps, it is also coming to the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
6985762	6987203	It's not a big surprise.
6990333	6991113	Now my Steam is working.
6991133	6991173	So.
7012472	7012872	Hooray!
7013213	7014073	And guess what, though?
7014093	7020018	At least, you know, well, you already know this, but I mean, if you buy a guitar early, you get a CD.
7022000	7023962	Of, like, actual songs that are included in the game?
7023982	7024923	Soundgarden's new album.
7025343	7027264	Oh, interesting tactic.
7027625	7029146	Yeah, if you like Soundgarden, I guess.
7030587	7033149	Yeah, I'll be blocking that on Facebook pretty quickly, no offense.
7033410	7034751	Just, you know, not really my thing.
7035731	7053619	Hey, but there's more details on Rock Band 3 I'm excited about this No Twitter or Facebook integration here Actually, they are confirming that you will be able to export Rock Band 2 tracks for a fee The export feature will work on all three consoles Of course, there's always a couple songs that get a little weird
7054059	7082094	so you can imagine that a couple songs are going to fall off the list unfortunately but most of them should come over for a small fee that's really cool regular download content will remain the regular price that's $2 per song but they are saying that for Rock Band 3's pro mode the songs will probably be more expensive because there's more work that has to be done on these tracks and they don't want to increase the cost of regular download content to subsidize the pro download content that's aimed at a smaller group of players
7082954	7111421	usually I'd be a little worried about this but I go you know what I feel like Harmonix kind of does the download content better than almost anyone right now so I'm like okay I trust them like I don't know how you guys feel but I'm just kind of like okay if that's what they say I trust them they get it I'm like they get it they've proved that they understand download content for a very long time this export feature's great you know yeah it's a fee but it's I understand it's out of their hands and it's licensing at least they bothered to do it at all I kind of go okay they know what they're doing if that's what they say then I agree
7114332	7140183	plus it also makes sense that the rock band stuff would cost a little more in the pro mode because there's probably less people buying them too you know yeah I mean you have to have the pro mode instruments and stuff like that which are really expensive well at least on the guitar it's really expensive but the keyboard's not so much I don't know I wouldn't want to pay extra for that stuff but if you really want to there's a market for it
7141744	7149511	I'm interested in the promo stuff, especially for keyboards, because once you learn how to play the song on the keyboard, you could actually go to a piano or whatever and play it.
7149551	7151392	I think that's awesome, if you can memorize it.
7151873	7154235	So I'm looking forward to trying that out.
7154255	7155116	That's going to be very cool.
7155996	7159580	So we're going to go over to DarkSakura, who's got another story for us here.
7160460	7161001	I sure do.
7161141	7165525	Coming up very soon, the mailbag at mailbag at orangeonline.com, the FU's of the week, and your calls.
7167040	7170981	Well, we've got a new challenger in for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
7172302	7175783	And this is pretty, pretty sweet.
7175823	7176983	But we're getting Tron Bon.
7177203	7178083	That's so cool.
7179264	7181324	She's kind of on crack.
7182124	7184785	She's kind of been in a lot of the fighting games, right?
7184805	7186606	Give us a new Mega Man Legends already!
7186986	7187626	I hate you!
7187646	7192447	The little Servbots have been in the background on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
7192848	7193588	They're so cute.
7193648	7194428	They look like Lego men.
7195874	7196675	Yeah, I agree, though.
7196695	7197836	Where's Mega Man Legends?
7198056	7201859	There is coming, but it's just going to take forever.
7202160	7204201	I would buy that on PS1 Classics if I could.
7204261	7204922	Is that available?
7204962	7205543	I don't think it is.
7206003	7206163	No.
7206183	7207064	For PS1 Classics?
7208891	7209972	Damn you, Capcom.
7210733	7213235	Just when you're doing so many things right, there's that one thing.
7213515	7213995	You know, though.
7214075	7214476	One thing.
7214556	7214796	Rob.
7215016	7215977	What?
7216838	7225385	You know, with if let's say that the homebrew scene or pirating scene, however you want to call it, gets to where it is on the PSP.
7225965	7234487	They have ways to convert PS1 ISO files into a playable format on the PlayStation emulator that's on the PSP.
7235048	7237688	So you can port Mega Man Legends or something like that.
7237808	7241189	So if they can do it for the PSP, they may be able to do it for the PS3.
7242190	7242670	Very nice.
7242950	7243170	Yes.
7243430	7246411	Or I could just find the PS1 disc somewhere and play it in my PS3.
7246531	7248771	I imagine it's not that hard to find.
7250232	7250912	No, they're not.
7252614	7256515	I don't remember the game being particularly rare, I could be wrong, but yeah.
7258076	7259796	Anyhow, speaking of Mega Man, Loki, right?
7260996	7266638	Yes, speaking of Mega Man, there's some new details coming out about Mega Man Universe, and it's kind of cool.
7267258	7275100	The game itself looks a little bit like it could be similar to the Mega Man Powered Up Mega Man, which was on the PSP.
7275440	7277181	It does include a level editor...
7277901	7279482	Oh, that's awesome.
7279863	7285306	That you'll be able to share, of course, with your friends, different levels that you've made.
7285666	7286907	It's LittleBigMegaMan.
7288468	7290309	Isn't that what this game is turning into, LittleBigMegaMan?
7290409	7292170	It seriously is getting pretty awesome.
7292430	7296893	And they had some other screenshots that showed different playable characters.
7296933	7300775	They had a screenshot that actually showed the box art Mega Man playing...
7302336	7310218	Also, you can create new Mega Man characters by mixing and matching different parts, like different heads and whatnot.
7311999	7312899	Really cool stuff.
7313059	7321382	And also, I guess they're saying that, of course, there's going to be the Ryu Mega Man that's in there, probably the Ghosts and Goblins Mega Man.
7321402	7321482	Yeah.
7324695	7325195	Mega Man.
7325615	7326376	Mega Man, yes.
7327176	7332737	Yes, in fact, here's the screenshot there of the box art one, which looks so ugly.
7332977	7336218	Well, you know this isn't the first time that Mega Man's had Street Fighter moves.
7337018	7342040	Because remember in X and X2, he could get the Hadouken and Shoryuken.
7342600	7345100	That's right, I vaguely recall that right.
7345601	7346301	Yeah, which I could do.
7346721	7347061	That's cool.
7348636	7359412	The game itself, though, I'm kind of rusty when it comes to identifying my Mega Man stages, but I'm wondering if it's going to have more than just it looks like Mega Man
7360633	7361694	2 characters.
7362214	7364456	It looks very Mega Man 2 inspired, doesn't it?
7364756	7366237	I'm wondering if it's going to have more than that.
7366317	7367058	That might be cool.
7367398	7370260	Alpha Cananagram in the chat is quick to correct me on things.
7370340	7375003	He says, Mega Man powered up with the level editor came out two years before Little Big Planet.
7375844	7377725	True enough, I suppose, but I don't know.
7377765	7381027	I kind of feel like Little Big Planet is what really made the splash.
7381067	7381568	You know what I mean?
7381608	7381968	I don't know.
7382528	7382729	Yeah.
7383469	7384370	But, okay, sure.
7384430	7387652	So this idea is, you know, not entirely new for the Mega Man series.
7387692	7388092	That's fine.
7388733	7388933	Mm-hmm.
7390706	7392167	Well, I know I'm interested in the game.
7392227	7392747	I'm going to buy it.
7392807	7394348	Is it arcade or is it retail?
7394388	7394908	Have they said?
7395268	7395588	Arcade.
7396048	7396489	Oh, man.
7396509	7397969	That's going to be a heck of an arcade game.
7399170	7401571	Hopefully it's not more than $20, but watch them be charging like $30.
7404092	7407173	If there's going to be a game that's going to break the price barrier yet again, it'll be this.
7407513	7407814	Watch.
7409774	7410255	We'll see, though.
7410295	7410855	Hopefully not.
7412483	7417085	If they do try to break the barrier, it might leave Valve to talk even more smack about Xbox Live.
7417165	7417806	Oh, you haven't heard.
7417866	7421267	Valve has apparently talked some smack about Xbox Live.
7421648	7426010	This is kind of interesting because I seem to recall some time ago it was just the reverse.
7426050	7432153	They used to dog on PlayStation 3 and they were supporting Xbox Live with exclusives such as Portal Still Alive.
7432553	7434694	Well, times have changed a little bit, haven't they?
7435354	7438576	Gabe Newell has referred to Xbox Live as a train wreck.
7440080	7444063	We thought that there would be something that would emerge because we figured it was sort of untenable.
7444743	7449126	Oh yeah, we understand that these are the rules now, but it's such a train wreck that something will have to change.
7449606	7452067	That's why we're really happy with the current situation with the PlayStation 3.
7452768	7459652	We're solving it now in a way that is going to work for our customers rather than assuming something is going to emerge later that will allow us to fix this.
7460572	7460892	Yikes.
7461513	7465735	They're saying that Microsoft has got to change the online policies if they want to compete.
7466075	7469698	You know, I want to say though, not the first person to dog a little bit on Xbox Live.
7470558	7479023	This kind of reminds me of Square Enix coming out a little bit ago saying that Final Fantasy XIV is not coming out on the Xbox 360 because Xbox Live just ain't going to work.
7481885	7482665	That's what they're saying.
7483266	7485147	So, very interesting.
7487420	7488040	Uh, yeah.
7489681	7492401	It's interesting to me kind of how Valve has come full circle.
7492761	7504064	I mean, and I can see the reasons why to an extent, and certainly again, not the first developer to say bad things about Xbox Live, but it's just very interesting how much things have changed in a few years.
7505364	7505784	There you go.
7506965	7508365	Let's get to the mailbag, shall we?
7508525	7511646	DarkSakura, you ready to rip open the email bag and read some emails for us here?
7511766	7512746	I'm ready to rip something.
7513066	7513526	Alright. ...
7519844	7524328	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some emails to be read on the air.
7524348	7525088	Did we get some emails?
7525188	7527230	The mailbag was pretty thin going into tonight's show.
7527250	7527830	Did we get some?
7527930	7528471	We got a few.
7528731	7529131	Hooray!
7529812	7532154	The first one's from AwesomeDude slash Troy.
7535957	7537378	Now this is the philosophical question.
7537398	7538178	I gave us some warning.
7539199	7541020	I don't see why you can't do both.
7541060	7541140	Jeez.
7570137	7573458	I know, it's tricky because what's going to prevent me from doing one over the other?
7573779	7574299	It's strange.
7575579	7578661	What if by being with somebody you leave your mark on the world?
7579101	7585064	I kind of feel like, okay, this is going to sound really cheesy, but I feel like in a way this show has left the mark on the world a little bit.
7585544	7591526	Like maybe not in a totally like amazing humanitarian Mother Teresa kind of way.
7592967	7601929	But just some of the really nice emails that I've got over the years, especially from other guys who sometimes struggle with... Oops, not the FU music yet.
7602749	7607470	Sometimes other guys who've struggled with coming out and stuff and saying that hearing me on the show has helped with that.
7607510	7615352	The power of an email like that is really hard to put into words and how that makes you feel like you've really had an impact.
7615392	7619973	And I know there's quote-unquote fans of all of us out there, which is such a strange...
7620473	7622535	Feeling because we're pretty normal people.
7622575	7627799	We just like video games and figured out how to do this radio thing pretty quickly and have stayed pretty dedicated to it.
7628719	7630000	That those kind of words have been amazing.
7630060	7636925	So I kind of feel like in some ways I've already picked the first option because I'm not living with a loved one right now.
7637326	7638607	The Dark Sakura is doing both.
7639047	7639327	Yeah.
7639808	7641629	So it's tough because you're asking me to backtrack.
7642410	7642790	I don't know.
7643709	7645010	I don't see why you can't do both.
7645770	7648131	They're not mutually exclusive.
7648511	7655374	Plus, if you live with a loved one, aren't you leaving your mark on the world with that relationship?
7655634	7657555	I know that sounds weird, but a little bit?
7657635	7663057	My philosophy is that the best way to change the world and leave your mark is to be an active part of making it better.
7663878	7664118	Huh.
7665578	7666919	DarkSakura.com
7682052	7683894	and it doesn't mean... I don't mean like sex.
7684094	7686157	I don't mean like love, like kissy kissy.
7686277	7688199	I just mean like there's all different types of love.
7688239	7689260	There's platonic love.
7689300	7691723	There's family love, brotherly love.
7692063	7693485	You know, there is romantic love.
7693525	7695507	There's love for Earth.
7695587	7700292	I don't mean to sound like a hippie or whatever, but I think that's kind of what a lot of it's about, isn't it?
7700472	7701794	You've nailed it on the head.
7701834	7702034	I mean...
7703235	7712040	and, you know, people get all butthurt over their own political, you know, points of view being, hey, everyone's got to believe what I do.
7713060	7718883	But, you know, if everyone was exactly the same, it would be boring and we would stagnate.
7719063	7721785	It's those differences that put a challenge...
7722885	7726911	Yes, but I am a firm believer that people don't grow without a challenge.
7727973	7730196	That you have to have that challenge for people to overcome.
7730476	7733280	And if they don't overcome, those are the people who don't get to do anything in the world.
7733961	7734863	You know, they're just going to
7737858	7745504	I have a hard time putting this because some people are content to live their life just being themselves, you know, not doing anything.
7746244	7755370	But I think that the best way to grow and challenge yourself is to move outside your comfort zone to do something that's going to make it better.
7756271	7757912	Because nothing changes until you make it change.
7759813	7761573	Well, that has nothing to do with games.
7761634	7763474	That was a very deep email for this program.
7763494	7766575	But hey, sorry to dodge your question, but hope you got out of it.
7766595	7767435	Loki didn't say anything.
7768735	7768855	Eh.
7771576	7772376	There, I said something.
7775017	7775697	Next email.
7776097	7777158	Hi, OLR crew.
7777218	7779498	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
7780139	7784680	I wanted to tell you that you did a pretty damn good job with the marathon on Sunday slash Monday.
7785040	7788961	I wish I could have been there while this was live, but I did catch the podcast.
7792181	7795904	You about many interesting topics like favorite game and soundtracks.
7796305	7798407	I guess it's you spoke about many interesting topics.
7798927	7800708	Like favorite game and soundtracks and other stuff.
7800748	7805432	Since I wasn't there to participate in the chatroom, I would like to participate to that with this email.
7806093	7809916	My favorite game and probably my favorite soundtrack of all time is Kirby Superstar.
7810737	7815841	So many different games to choose from and they're pretty detailed with puzzles and pretty good platforming.
7816181	7817422	Actdeft likes Kirby?
7817462	7818022	You don't say.
7818102	7818783	I didn't know.
7819023	7819704	I hadn't heard.
7819904	7820144	Hey.
7820324	7820864	No, it's funny.
7820944	7821205	It's cool.
7821225	7822986	And the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing.
7823086	7828910	And probably since then, it has made me so interested in video music like I am now.
7829691	7830591	Video game music, sorry.
7831172	7835134	I would really recommend people getting Kirby Superstar Ultra on the DS.
7835435	7840038	The extra additions to it make it worthy of any DS game library.
7841319	7842920	But not as all-happy game-wise.
7844127	7844487	Excuse me.
7845347	7846668	You also talked about disappointments.
7846728	7847848	Mine was Final Fantasy VIII.
7848668	7851109	Got it for cheap, but I still think I got robbed.
7852249	7853170	Hey, let me finish.
7854110	7863853	While I don't like Final Fantasy VII either, at least decent in lots of things, Final Fantasy VIII really takes all the good things of the series and burns them to the ground.
7864253	7865553	The card game is damn awful.
7865874	7867214	I never played the card game, for the record.
7867734	7873476	And it doesn't give you a real good incentive to play it, kind of like Blitzball and Final Fantasy X, which I didn't really do either.
7874176	7877561	Um, but the thing I hate the most about the whole damn game is the story.
7877702	7878162	It sucks.
7878323	7878643	Bad.
7878743	7879464	It's terror bad.
7880486	7884432	I don't even like Final Fantasy X pretty much for the same things, but I didn't buy it.
7884812	7889920	And even though the battle system and grid system is kind of cool, Final Fantasy VIII, really, I don't give a crap about that game.
7890620	7895284	See, he doesn't like it for the wrong reasons, because I think the story was actually its strongest part.
7895444	7897445	It's the battles that really did it in for me.
7897806	7902129	But from what I played of the beta, 14 very well might be worse than 8.
7903010	7904291	Like, I don't know yet.
7904831	7911757	I guess I will have to play the retail version at some point to give you my final thoughts, but there may be a new challenger for the worst Final Fantasy game ever.
7912077	7913397	Oh no, a new challenger has appeared.
7913557	7913838	I know.
7914718	7915218	I'll let you know.
7915938	7917059	Oh well, that's all for now.
7917219	7921460	I will talk about other stuff you talked about next week, but I don't want to send a big ass email.
7921500	7921860	Too late!
7922060	7922400	No kidding.
7923220	7923941	Until next time.
7924421	7924741	P.S.
7924921	7927402	I still don't believe that Duke Nukem Forever will get released.
7928982	7929442	We'll see.
7932983	7936124	I think it will now that it's with the new developer.
7936845	7938025	I think that's what had to happen.
7938065	7940326	It just needed to be taken by somebody else.
7940966	7941586	It'll come out now.
7942153	7943154	Okay, next email.
7944114	7948897	When you guys were young, did you ever play a game that was so horrible but there was something about it that always kept you playing?
7949437	7951738	One bad game that comes to mind is Banjo-Kazooie.
7951858	7957141	I spent countless hours sitting in front of my parents' TV screen trying to collect all those little glowing puzzle pieces.
7957522	7960824	I wanted to punch the TV screen every time the crazy bear and bird spoke.
7961204	7964045	However, for some unknown reason, I kept playing until I beat it.
7964345	7966467	Today, I cringe when I hear any song from that game.
7966527	7967267	What about you guys?
7967507	7968688	Your fellow girl gamer, Ziba.
7970785	7982531	Clash at Demon Head totally like it's not that great a game really but totally a guilty pleasure game like I used to love that game and I don't know why as far as like old school 8-bit NES games go
7984170	7987911	I really can't remember any that I just... There's games that pissed me off that I'd keep playing.
7988611	7989772	Like Puzzle and Desu.
7989872	7990332	I'm sorry.
7990632	7992253	You remember I covered that on Classic Game?
7993113	7994653	That game pisses me off so much.
7995714	8001395	And it's really not even the best game ever, but the challenge is so hard to it.
8002856	8003956	Oh, that game pisses me off.
8005077	8006117	What about you, Loki?
8008698	8008858	Um...
8010876	8011837	Earth Defense Force.
8013519	8017943	It gets really challenging, especially when you get on those Inferno levels, man.
8019564	8021706	Sometimes it makes me want to hurt somebody.
8022207	8023067	I just play more of it.
8024168	8024749	Good call.
8025791	8026771	Last email.
8027171	8028552	No.
8029372	8030052	Hey, OLR.
8030172	8035194	Emailing in on a few things that I wouldn't otherwise contribute via chat, but I know I would forget.
8035254	8035914	So here it goes.
8036694	8047158	I know this news is two weeks late, but Sony not only has their dreaded online pass on some sports games, but it's on an awesome PSP FPS called SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3.
8048778	8055106	Also, this may be old news, but I've never heard this on the radio.
8055227	8058451	Any of you heard of a game called Minecraft?
8059292	8061435	Don't judge on graphics, although you guys probably wouldn't.
8061895	8066201	My way of describing it would be Awesome Sauce Imagination Orgasm.
8067302	8074187	You have unlimited boundaries north, south, east, and west and you can go really far up and down and it's only in alpha.
8074227	8076168	Give it a try and decide whether or not to buy it.
8076508	8080791	It's only 10 euros or about 13 bucks and it entitles you to play future releases of the game.
8081151	8085814	And he put the address, it's Minecraft, M-I-N-E-C-R-A-F-T dot net.
8085834	8087435	Is he a co-producer or writer?
8087776	8088116	I don't know.
8088896	8089337	I don't think so.
8089997	8092359	Currently, it has only one developer but he's awesome.
8093479	8094479	Here's the bullshit part.
8094879	8101781	He's been making so much money from people paying for it, PayPal fucking froze his account due to a suspicious withdrawal or deposit.
8103021	8103641	That's pretty funny.
8106802	8109443	I'm actually going to look at this real quick.
8109463	8112883	Hitstun in our chatroom says there's a lot of Minecraft on Justin.tv.
8113604	8114484	It doesn't look that bad.
8114544	8119125	It looks really Super Nintendo-ish 3D.
8120834	8125505	But yeah, apparently he... It was over 600,000 euros and then...
8130012	8132193	PayPal is like trying to keep the money or something.
8132353	8132833	That's weird.
8133294	8134134	That's kind of screwed up.
8134254	8135254	Yeah, that is messed up.
8135695	8136875	Anyway, I'm going to continue.
8137696	8144299	Minecraft may seem odd at first, but it's great and freaking addictive when you realize all the possible things you can do slash make.
8145339	8150862	Well, I think that's enough for one email, but I'll chat slash call in if I have anything else of interest that comes up.
8151502	8153623	May the flying spaghetti monster bless your souls.
8153783	8154904	Dark Yusuke, a.k.a.
8154984	8155264	Butcher.
8155484	8155864	Ramen.
8157219	8157579	P.S.
8157759	8160462	Going to be super sad to not hear your voices next week.
8161803	8163384	I guess he's not going to be listening next week.
8164024	8165065	Oh, I forgot.
8165125	8167087	He sent us a tweet that said disregard is P.S.
8167647	8167967	Oops.
8168488	8168908	Oopsie.
8169408	8169829	Whoops.
8172251	8173051	Screwed up on that one.
8173612	8179016	I think he might have us mixed up with Bobby Blackwolf because Bobby's not live next week.
8179156	8180037	Oh, YouTube.
8180297	8181257	Alan sent me this YouTube.
8181278	8182739	And if Alan sent it to me, I have to look at it.
8182799	8184060	He told me a little bit about what it is.
8184080	8185160	And I had heard of this.
8185821	8186802	And it sounds kind of cool.
8189029	8191130	Oh, it's like stop motion.
8191690	8197012	All these people in colored shirts sitting in chairs doing Pac-Man.
8197673	8198753	They do these in a movie theater.
8199193	8199813	That's kind of rad.
8199893	8202194	Can Alan link that in chat, please?
8202254	8202574	Thank you.
8209352	8210733	I like the little noise in the background.
8210753	8211653	Let me turn that up a little bit.
8211914	8213715	I love the noises more than anything.
8213835	8218257	Okay, anyway, this makes for terrible radio, but... People did a Space Invaders one.
8219158	8220839	That takes a lot of work.
8220859	8222380	Like, that took all day.
8238988	8240930	God, college kids.
8241830	8244232	Y'all have too much free time.
8244712	8254860	It's a lot of it's editing though because all they had to do was get one scene where everybody was sitting in the grid in the beginning and then just take one shot of that and then keep superimposing where he's at.
8257222	8261886	It does take a lot of effort but it's not as much as magic and witchcraft.
8262166	8267710	Or they took one shot where he was in each spot and just kept playing stop motion.
8267730	8268130	Makes sense.
8268411	8268551	Yeah.
8269131	8271093	They had to hold that camera real steady.
8271953	8272654	Real steady.
8274275	8276657	Hey, it's that time of the show where we get mad.
8276957	8277758	The FUs of the Week.
8294268	8298629	My FU of the week goes to Dan not being here.
8299689	8302390	Well, I mean, and I understand it was important to go to see his family.
8303130	8313113	But still, it doesn't really stop me from being very lonely because he's been... You know, while he's not working and I wasn't working, I was used to having him here all day and it was really nice.
8313273	8315733	And now he's not there.
8315873	8321374	And also, I have to go back into the office tomorrow because bitches didn't send me my letter about getting laid off.
8321735	8323255	And I haven't been paid in two weeks.
8324376	8325396	So you know what this means.
8326077	8326437	War.
8326577	8336285	If they don't fix it, I can collect interest on my pay, and if they don't get anything to me, I'm going to the labor board.
8336365	8337106	Alert the media.
8338624	8352391	Well, I could talk to the media, too, because... I don't know how far I want to get into this, but I was looking at work at the news and the latest things, and I saw your work on the local news media site, so... about the closure, because I guess it was a big deal.
8352471	8354592	And see, I never got any memo that says don't talk about it.
8355733	8355953	Oh!
8356253	8356773	I'm not under a DA.
8356793	8356833	Oh.
8356873	8357113	Uh, Loki.
8363188	8366612	I had some that I was really pissed off about earlier, and I don't remember what it was.
8366912	8373399	I'm going to go with my second thing that I'm pissed off at, and that would be Apple.
8373560	8375261	I'm pissed off at their customer service.
8375762	8377584	It's good and terrible at the same time.
8378285	8384532	The reps are nice, but the simple logic stuff just doesn't seem to apply to them.
8385012	8394696	For example, I purchased two iPod Touches from them using an Apple gift card that I got from Sony from my work for some sort of sales incentive thing.
8395956	8404600	I purchased it on the 3rd, and according to the site when I ordered it, it said it was going to be shipped this week.
8405580	8408922	Instead, this week, they changed it so that it's shipping next week.
8409782	8413544	and, you know, in the meanwhile, you know, the Apple Store has tons of these.
8413604	8416505	They have just like a pile of them just sitting there.
8416945	8423288	So I called them up multiple times going, um, I need to cancel my order so that, you know, I can go purchase.
8423428	8424188	Oh, I'm sorry.
8424408	8431031	Even though we took off the funds immediately out of your card, it's going to take us five to seven business days to put it back on the card.
8431051	8431331	What?
8431551	8433272	Even though it's their own Apple card.
8433352	8433472	What?
8433752	8434634	I'm like, well, okay, fine.
8434654	8435715	I don't really want to cancel it.
8435776	8439261	I just want to pick it up at the local store because they have them in stock.
8439782	8440423	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
8440443	8442747	You can't do that because our systems are separate.
8444076	8444957	So that's retarded.
8445137	8447379	It finally shipped, though, on Friday.
8447759	8448840	FROM CANADA!
8449460	8453683	Why the fuck are you shipping something from Canada to the United States?
8453883	8456926	I'm sure you have a fucking plant in the U.S.
8457006	8458387	that you could ship these from.
8458707	8461689	But no, let's pick a really far away place to ship it from.
8461930	8463291	Just to piss me off even more.
8463571	8469295	If I didn't have that fucking gift card, I wouldn't be buying your stupid iPods.
8470136	8472758	Like I'm fucking going to buy an ITV or an iMac.
8473326	8474088	No way!
8475170	8475972	We're part of Canada.
8477235	8477816	I don't know.
8478337	8479700	I'm not familiar with Canada.
8480101	8482406	I can look that up real quick while you do your FGs, though.
8483050	8483370	I will.
8483450	8492153	My FU goes to myself because I've managed to put a scratch on my brand new car after having it for only about two and a half months because I don't know how to park.
8493254	8494354	Don't worry, I didn't hit another car.
8494374	8498375	I refrain from making fun of me because I will destroy you.
8499396	8502297	I scratched the car parking in Alan's garage.
8503357	8505440	Thanks for watching!
8522523	8525544	Because there's no Shanghai, Canada It's China!
8525884	8548713	They're shipping it from China Yeah, let's pick the furthest place from my location to ship this from That's probably where the damn thing's made I like that, that's awesome Oh, and by the way, because Apple's so wonderful in saving their costs They ship them separate The two items are actually separate Thank you Thank you for doing all that wonderful stuff for me Why are you mad, though?
8553137	8554058	Hey, more news.
8554118	8554718	Happy, happy.
8554798	8557379	And then the Skype line's coming at you.

8562522	8567625	So there's a brand new Overclock remix album that's coming out.

8571787	8576189	This time it's going to be a five-part Final Fantasy V compilation.
8577170	8577690	Oh, I get it.

8619478	8623160	And being asked in chat from Floppy Discourse, what about Google Talk?
8623220	8625741	Doesn't Google Talk let you call 877 numbers now?
8625822	8627422	Like you can call numbers in the US and Canada?
8627683	8628763	You can actually call numbers?
8629443	8630284	That's what I heard, yeah.
8631107	8658950	I'm actually going to link my phone with Google Talk once I get I was going to get a prepaid phone through like AT&T or something like that but I don't like AT&T because they're like oh by the way there's all these fees we add on top of that because I only would use like 12 minutes a month and I'd use their 25 cent per minute plan or something like that but then they're like oh we're going to add another dollar fee on there oh and there's taxes oh and there's this oh and there's convenience fee
8662546	8663828	So I'll just go through Virgin.

8666752	8669076	Do you know the name Chiaki Kuriyama?
8669737	8670378	I hope you do.

8771286	8772647	hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
8774164	8775745	Hey, this is DJ Blaziken.
8775885	8777686	DJ Blaziken, what's on your mind?
8779707	8798216	Not much, other than I got a little bit of a similar situation that Loki kind of discussed a while back on an episode how he's trying to stray away from the three fret formation because he was a converger from guitar freaks to guitar hero.
8798276	8799377	Well, let's just say here,
8800114	8803998	I had the same excuse when I started playing Guitar Hero.
8804618	8806620	I'm like, I cannot play medium.
8806860	8807801	There's four notes.
8808141	8809643	There should only be three.
8809663	8811404	Oh, it wasn't that hard.
8811945	8812786	It wasn't that hard.
8813026	8818371	And all it takes is Loki, one word, practice.
8818771	8820072	That's right, practice.
8820833	8822394	Yeah, but that also takes time.
8822955	8824716	And time I'm not willing to spend on that.
8825237	8826418	I'll mod grant that instead.
8828149	8833693	I will say, though, I recently downloaded and played the DJ Hero 2 demo.
8835234	8836115	Oh, I forgot that's out.
8836235	8836935	I did half that.
8837216	8837716	You know what?
8837756	8842919	Those bastards didn't put it on PlayStation Network, though, and my controller and gamer for PlayStation Network.
8843000	8849144	It's exclusive to Xbox 360 because we're Activision and we suck.
8850925	8851865	Well, okay.
8852066	8853887	I will say, though, it is pretty cool.
8854677	8866048	Um, on the Factor, now they have, uh, the DJ battle mode, which is basically, okay, if you remember just normal space off in Guitar Hero, it's basically what this is for DJ Hero.
8866349	8867169	It's all it is.
8867490	8867710	Hmm.
8868206	8872849	So, like, you do one part, and then the other player does another part, and it goes back and forth.
8873370	8881396	I'm still wondering, though, if they're going to do... And I forgot to ask him when he was there, if they're going to do the guitar here, or the guitar DJ stuff again.
8881876	8882777	Oh, that was kind of cool.
8882817	8884137	Yeah, yeah.
8884398	8888080	By what I was seeing on the demo, there wasn't anything for guitar and DJ.
8888140	8891223	It was mostly the vocals and DJ stuff.
8891243	8891663	Yeah.
8892103	8901591	and my father kind of found it kind of weird that I was singing the song Don't Ya, the Don't Ya remix and then the Lady Gaga remix.
8902712	8909138	It would have been cool though if they did that because they could have had vocals and they could have had guitars and then a DJ or something.
8910783	8915629	Man, that would be great for Loki to get that on YouTube too, doing a Doncha.
8915729	8930627	You know what they really should have done, but I'm sure they don't want to affect their DJ Hero sales, is you know how Rock Band 3 added keyboards, have the next Guitar Hero game add turntables to the actual rock stuff.
8931932	8933473	How many songs really support that though?
8933493	8937156	Not many, but it'd be kind of neat though, like as a little added download content.
8937196	8940359	Well, I mean, it's just like how many songs support a guitar in DJ Hero?
8940919	8943101	Not a lot, but it was pretty cool, the ones that did.
8943581	8944962	And actually, do you know what?
8945303	8954050	Of all the weird things, okay, you know how you guys were talking about how, you know, learning the actual dance moves from Dance Central and whatnot?
8954750	8957973	Well, of all the weird things, one of my...
8960100	8969869	One of my friends went to a Macy's store and actually went and tried out, I think it was Dance Central, and he showed me some of the moves to Lady Gaga's Poker Face.
8971030	8982641	And let's just say here, I think it was that or Just Dance that came on at Homecoming, and we were actually pulling off the actual dance moves from the music video.
8983704	8991512	and let's just say here we were getting questions asked like how do you know the moves from the video and you both got laid, right?
8993174	8993454	huh?
8993835	8994115	nothing
8996274	9021835	basically our answer was we learned them from a video game people just give us a weird eye and it was the same thing it was the same thing we were doing next time next time next time you need to say private lessons private lessons is your answer next time you know it's not I mean because see a game like you know even even just dance actually it's not you know just it shows you dance moves but I don't know if
9022615	9023936	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9049406	9051048	That was the last good one.
9051168	9056012	That was one of our first songs retired from the cage match because the video was so awesome.
9056372	9057894	It is awesome.
9057994	9058975	There's a song on there.
9059035	9064579	I don't remember which artist it is, but they have like a Tron guy dancing in the background of Just Dance 2.
9064720	9072847	But anyways, as I was going to say, I got to pick some songs and then the Ubisoft ref, she got to pick some songs and unfortunately she picked It's Raining Men.
9073367	9076030	So there is a video out there of me
9076810	9083793	Trying to beat her at, you know, I was trying to be more fabulous than she was, I guess, at that.
9083973	9085354	But I got close.
9085474	9086934	I did not beat her, though, at that song.
9087054	9091376	And thank God, because that would have been the only song that I actually beat her in, and that would not be good either.
9091576	9093737	Sorry, I just need to hear a little bit of this song here.
9105117	9106177	This song's pretty amazing.
9106897	9109038	Too bad this band never really went anywhere but this song.
9110258	9120580	Hey, um, by the way, uh, on the fact that, okay, I figured out a way to sort of try to play Guitar Hero Rock Band and, um, what else?
9120780	9124100	Rock Revolution to make the guitar point like Guitar Freaks.
9124620	9133682	Apparently all I've had to do is flip my miniature miter like it's a nine-incher miter upside down, flip it to lefty mode,
9135158	9139001	and that's how I've been able to make it play like Guitar Freaks almost.
9139841	9142983	That is a lot of effort for such a little reward.
9143443	9144684	But hey, whatever makes you happy, dude.
9145144	9145384	Alright.
9146125	9148546	We gotta let you go to get some more calls, dude.
9148907	9150968	I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off because we gotta get some more calls.
9151268	9152008	But thank you so much.
9153409	9154190	One last thing.
9154290	9160574	We actually did some DDR moves to, I think it was My Sharona.
9160914	9161034	And?
9161597	9172304	And let's just say here, one or two guys who said they might have heard your show back in the day think we should have been on Step Squad years ago and should have been at DDR Tournaments.
9173945	9176387	We've been watching a bunch of Mel B dance videos from the tournaments.
9176407	9177928	People remember the show from years ago.
9179453	9196426	Alright, well next time take an orange bat to prom, that's all I'm saying If you really want to represent the show, later Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call Or Orange Launch Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call that way like this person is Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9197126	9198848	Hey, it's Ranma, what's up everyone?
9198868	9200049	Hey, Ranma, what's up?
9200973	9201393	Not much.
9202294	9208437	To answer what you said about the Texas Instrument Calculators, they're still making them in multiple models and flavors.
9208797	9215840	I just would have thought that they were on model 90-100 by now, you know what I mean?
9215880	9217641	Instead of 82, because that was years ago.
9218413	9222535	Well, my roommate has a TI-85, but they don't make that one anymore.
9222715	9233979	From what I remember, this is from like a few months ago, they still make the 83, the 84, 84+, 84+, Silver, the 89, and one called the Inspire.
9234339	9235980	One side is a scientific calculator.
9236200	9237880	You pull the keyboard out and you flip it over.
9237920	9239101	It's like a mini computer.
9239301	9241221	That sounds like a sidekick or something.
9241261	9241882	That's crazy.
9243271	9256827	and yet that thing is like 200 bucks and around this time of the year the parents come in with the list of stuff that the kids need and if they're taking entry level algebra math they're told that they need a TI calculator.
9256987	9258488	Now who remembers the TI-99-4A?
9260771	9261551	And we remember that?
9262352	9262972	I had that.
9263032	9265893	That was a computer in the 1980s, the TI-99.
9266074	9266574	I had that.
9266714	9267734	I had that.
9267854	9269155	With the big cartridge thing on the side?
9269415	9271436	Oh, yeah, the big old cartridge slot that went on the side.
9271456	9272697	I've played so many games on that.
9272937	9273477	Oh, yeah.
9273677	9274878	That's one thing that I need to find.
9274958	9275678	Oh, I'm in Chickie Bay.
9276539	9278680	You want to get a TI-99 just for the heck of it?
9278920	9279320	Shit, yeah.
9279860	9281681	Just so you can play, like, Texas Invaders?
9283742	9284042	Wow.
9285703	9286643	Would that be Mexicans?
9286963	9289985	No, it's a Space Invaders ripoff, you...
9291397	9291877	Dingbat.
9291977	9292277	Alright.
9292538	9294178	I'm sorry, that'd be Arizona Invaders.
9294438	9295119	Stop it.
9296279	9296619	Alright.
9299641	9301081	Well, thank you for the update on Calculus.
9301101	9302982	I actually have a story to tell.
9303202	9303943	Alright, make it quick.
9304623	9304963	Okay.
9306384	9315888	I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World a couple of weeks ago, and I was checking my scores on the leaderboards, and I'm going to post a link in the chatroom off of TwitPick because it makes for great radio.
9316208	9319650	Now, the funny thing is, if you look at it, I'm ranked...
9320470	9321650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9344818	9352561	I just find it funny that when I first got Rock Band, I went in and I created my band, which was my roommate's idea, which was called Rhythm and Jews.
9353022	9359825	When I put it in, it said, and I quote, Jews are banned on Xbox Live.
9361345	9363206	I think that was a programming issue.
9365007	9369749	I had to go and change the E to a 3 so I can get on and play.
9371542	9374004	Well, did you report the name for being offensive?
9374024	9390417	Because I'm thinking, you know, call me crazy, but if Mount Gay or whatever, no, Fort Gay, West Virginia is going to get banned, I have a feeling I'm a greedy Jew might be slightly offensive, and I don't think that's a town in like South Carolina or anything.
9390477	9392618	I'm pretty sure that guy's just a douchebag.
9393439	9394999	and I've seen a couple more names like that.
9395220	9401441	So I popped in Rock Band 2, flipped the 3 back to an E and I had no problem going on live.
9404482	9405442	Whatever makes you happy.
9406303	9408223	I'm just amused by it, that's all.
9409363	9410844	It just amuses me.
9410884	9411524	That's all it is.
9412644	9412984	Alright.
9414125	9422827	Now that we have one sitting in studio, I have to ask the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura, are you offended by the name I'm a Greedy Jew on Xbox Live?
9425677	9430743	I don't really get offended, I think, by other people, really, because they're the ones who are stupid and ignorant, and I'm not.
9431864	9441755	However, he could very likely just admit all the, you know, perhaps he admits that he's Maybe perhaps he is Jewish and happens to be a bit greedy.
9442636	9443056	That could be.
9443076	9443917	Maybe it's really SSJ100 Matt.
9448201	9450763	You called him in the show just to make that joke, didn't you?
9451483	9452204	You little shit.
9452224	9453545	Kind of, sorta.
9453585	9454866	However.
9455447	9455927	However.
9464934	9469898	I just have a hard time about being offended by other people's ignorance.
9470279	9471540	They're just, they're poop.
9472801	9473722	They're being poopy.
9473802	9475383	Why is that person worth my time?
9478270	9483271	I think it's a symptom of society.
9485752	9486652	I don't think it's funny.
9487552	9488452	I don't think it's funny at all.
9489832	9497414	And I'm sure it is intended to be offensive, but I would rather just not give them the satisfaction of being offended.
9498614	9498914	That's me.
9500374	9500754	Alright.
9501694	9505135	Well, Ranma, any other offensive things you want to bring to the attention of our little program?
9507315	9528849	Bababooey, Bababooey, Howard Stern Alright, bye Ranma 1877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you care to venture that way We're taking your calls live as we tape our show on this lovely Sunday evening Live, our women here are hot and ready to go What?
9529049	9530010	No What?
9530971	9534213	Sorry, confusing job Clearly, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9535566	9536327	Hey, can you guys hear me?
9536767	9537508	Yes, we can.
9537568	9537788	Hi.
9537808	9540530	Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
9540690	9542492	DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?
9542512	9544473	Hey, not much.
9545214	9548276	Two things, just real quick, that shows how hell is freezing over.
9549557	9551279	First, I'm actually getting Halo Reach.
9551899	9553361	Oh my gosh, Halo Reach around.
9553381	9554201	Are you excited for it?
9556303	9562428	Somewhat, only because it's the last game in the series, apparently, and I'm getting a $20 gift card from Best Buy, so why not?
9563943	9567586	I need to get more games that everybody can play, not just myself.
9592386	9593386	Like party games.
9594647	9595507	You could say that.
9595587	9600208	Like games are not like... What about the PlayStation Move?
9600328	9603029	I mean, it's just going to be a bunch of Wii party games on the Move.
9603269	9604049	Any interest in that?
9605270	9608570	Actually, that is the reason I'm getting it, first off, for the Move.
9609771	9610491	Aha.
9610631	9611331	There you go right there.
9611391	9615632	I'm just thinking... Oh, sorry.
9615672	9615933	Go ahead.
9617213	9620054	I was just thinking more games than just the Move games.
9620074	9620954	You know, something else...
9622214	9624755	The SingStar franchise is always a good party starter.
9624875	9628656	That's really popular at parties because it's like karaoke, one of the karaoke games.
9629117	9633638	It's a little different from Rock Band and those games because A, it's exclusively singing and lets you do duets and stuff.
9633978	9640681	And B, it actually shows the actual music videos in the background, which I think is kind of a nice touch, especially for people that aren't as familiar with video games.
9640741	9642981	It's like suddenly you have a karaoke bar in your house.
9643342	9645542	So that's all interesting in that regard.
9645602	9647063	Those are always fun games.
9647583	9647983	What else?
9648944	9652487	Fun party games on the PlayStation 3 or multiplayer events.
9652887	9656449	LittleBigPlanet, absolutely, is a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
9656750	9659672	Up to four people can play that game at once, online or in the same house.
9659992	9660972	Moderation Racers.
9661393	9662233	Oh, that's a good one, too.
9662634	9664155	That's a good one for multiplayer.
9664175	9665275	Does it have split screens?
9665295	9665816	You can do that all?
9665836	9666596	I believe it does.
9666817	9667177	Nice.
9667857	9668378	Very nice.
9669478	9671019	What are the fun little party games?
9671660	9671980	Blur.
9673041	9673921	Perhaps.
9674021	9675482	I'm trying to think of things that are exclusive.
9675863	9678084	Because you said you had a 360, right?
9678204	9679985	There is Buzz.
9681166	9683488	Oh, Buzz is very popular for parties.
9683508	9684688	That's the game showy game.
9685029	9688551	When it comes to the special controllers that are just like the A, B, C, and D answers.
9689111	9690973	And people can write their own questions and everything.
9691073	9692634	That is a big, big party game.
9693454	9696036	Wait, you can write in your own questions?
9723735	9724475	when anyone play that?
9724535	9739210	I don't know so I guess those are our suggestions so let us know what you end up buying and if you have fun with it I definitely will guys alright, well have fun with Playstation 3 keep on gaming and we'll talk to you later, okay?
9740452	9743615	alright, be good guys later, we'll try alright
9744172	9745494	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9745534	9755226	Sorry for those guys that didn't get through, but be sure to always leave us an email, mailbag at orangeloundradio.com or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and so forth.
9755746	9757849	Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to tonight?
9758305	9759906	It's not a lot tonight.
9761027	9767672	One is that there's a rumor that the Nintendo DS, or not the DS, the 3DS will be out in Japan in November.
9768113	9772897	This is coming from a company called Keys Factory.
9773357	9779021	They design a bunch of DS, DSi, DSi XL peripherals.
9779782	9783025	And apparently this is coming from their Twitter.
9783765	9784886	And it was saying that...
9788422	9789082	Let's see here.
9789223	9793225	It was saying November 20th is when they're expecting the system out.
9795046	9796567	So that's interesting.
9796587	9802450	It says on November 20th, 11 3DS products that we designed go on sale all at once.
9802570	9805332	People who are buying the 3DS buy it at the same time.
9806644	9807445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9821964	9823385	Um, so that's that.
9823566	9831231	And then, uh, Nights in the Nightmare, a game that was originally out on the Nintendo DS from Atlus, uh, is coming to the PSP.
9831932	9842300	And kind of as an added bonus, um, they are going to be giving you a copy, a digital copy that is, of, um, and I cannot pronounce this, but we're going to try.
9843120	9844361	Um, looks like, uh...
9845462	9847363	Yggdra Union, I guess.
9847964	9856609	Y-G-G-D-R-A And that's going to be in every launch copy of Knights of the Nightmare.
9856929	9861291	But knowing Atlas, that will be all the copies of Knights of the Nightmare on PSP.
9861571	9865534	And that's scheduled to come out November 9th.
9867495	9868055	So that's kind of cool.
9870597	9871257	And that'd be it.
9872443	9873984	Wow, that's kind of slow on the last minute news.
9874004	9875345	Yeah, it's pretty dead.
9876185	9876505	Alright.
9877946	9883789	Well, that's going to do it for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we get around and get everybody's final thought.
9885010	9886411	DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?
9886991	9887631	Sue books!
9891081	9893262	Can we please make that the fortune cookie message tonight?
9893642	9897124	I don't know what you had picked, but... Okay, okay, okay.
9897264	9898025	All right, thank you.
9898665	9899005	Thank you.
9899085	9900206	Let me pick one once in a while.
9900226	9903648	I had Louis Black, so... We'll roll him over to next week.
9903688	9904128	You won't mind.
9904208	9904488	All right.
9905769	9907089	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9907269	9908410	I don't catch that reference.
9908590	9909170	You will soon.
9909931	9911912	All right.
9911972	9914293	Is that it for your final... I don't get it.
9914733	9917695	Hopefully I'll have a connect in two weeks.
