00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,240
Tonight, September 19th, 2010, a much-hyped MMO shuts down after only three months.

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,440
Konami and Harmonix settle their rock band lawsuit, and the Nielsen Report rates the

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,800
effectiveness of ads and video games.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Radio.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,180
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,360
We meet live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,560
Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, except tonight actually we didn't

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,680
meet after the Bobby Black Wolf show because he's on vacation.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
How dare he?

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,840
Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours.

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,560
Say hello to my awesome co-hosts, the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,400
How are you my friend?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
That good, huh?

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
I'm doing fantastic, Rob.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm glad to hear it.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,120
And how are you today?

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,760
Super, thanks for asking.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
Great.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Alright, also joining us, as he does every week, say hello to the one and only Techmaster

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Loki.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,240
That last fry didn't taste good.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm sorry to hear that, but I heard you exclaim literally as the opening credits are rolling

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,200
on our show, I hear Loki go, ooh, bonus onion ring.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Yeah, because they mixed, they contaminated my fries with an onion ring in there.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
You don't like onion rings?

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Onion rings are the best.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
No, I do.

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,400
I just wasn't expecting an onion ring, because I'm expecting their bland fries.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
That onion ring was a nice add to both.

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,000
Now I could get just onion rings, but I do like their fries still, even though they are

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
bland.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,160
Another episode of Orange Lounge Foodio here as we tape live.

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,820
Pretty busy weekend gaming, thanks to the Tokyo Game Show.

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,440
There's a lot of news and stuff going on here in the States as well, just like so much to

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
talk about tonight.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,960
We supposedly have some guests coming, but I got a text that they're running late, of

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,940
course, because these people always run late, shh, don't tell them, but I'm assuming they'll

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,480
be here any moment, so we'll introduce them whenever they show up.

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,500
They probably won't come into the studio quietly, so I apologize in advance for any derailment

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,280
that is bound to happen on this lovely radio program.

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,540
It's okay, I dressed up.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,160
Let's talk, yes you did, you went all out today.

44
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,440
Alright, she's wearing her pajamas just so you guys know.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,200
Alright, let's start it off with how was your gaming week and the types of video games you've

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,180
been playing this week, and I know DarkSakura finally jumped into something because I got

47
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,560
a text message earlier this week that let me know she did.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
So what's up DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,280
I started Final Fantasy 13, and I got to the part where they transformed into special people,

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,880
so that's as far as I am right now.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,840
And I'm playing The Sims 3 right now because Dan got me ambitions, and Dan's home from

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
his trip and I'm so happy.

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,560
And that's it.

54
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,920
So Final Fantasy 13, what do you think of the battle system, it kind of takes forever

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,400
to get going doesn't it?

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Yeah, I'm like, the game that plays itself, I'm just going to sit back and eat some rice

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,320
and watch a movie.

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,960
Which is basically how I've been treating it, it's like oh it's a movie that I can push

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,240
a button every so often.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,600
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, you know it's you guys that really make the

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,400
show every Sunday night as we do Tape Live.

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,000
And go to lovely comments such as the following from Spazinator PSN in chat, if Jamie's doing

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,440
fantastic then I'm Betty fucking Crocker, she sounds like frustrated as all hell.

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:42,040
No, I had a long day yesterday because it was Yom Kippur, and so it's basically, to

65
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,760
sum it up in a nutshell, it's the day of atonement, so basically you apologize a lot and don't

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,440
need anything.

67
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,840
That's putting a really simplistic view on it.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,080
It's really, it's very beautiful service, I was very happy to have attended all day,

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,000
and I was very happy to eat when the sun went down.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,800
So after 24 hours of fasting, Betty fucking Crocker sounds pretty good, huh?

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,960
More like 20, 26 hours?

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
25?

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,420
Oh, but who's counting?

74
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
More sundown than post-sundown.

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,440
Yeah, well, you end up counting.

76
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,680
But it was a really nice experience, it was good, but I had to get up early this morning

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,120
and record the other podcast.

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
And then I had-

79
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
That other show.

80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
Oh, bite my butt.

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:34,280
And then I had to, I had to talk with my client for a little while, and then I just said like,

82
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,120
forget the world, I'm taking a nap.

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,380
And then I've got to do algebra homework tonight.

84
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,400
And three poster designs tomorrow.

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
Speaking of other podcasts, the Rob and Extefer Warcraft show is supposed to start this week,

86
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,020
but sadly we ran into some technical difficulties.

87
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
We can't seem to do Skype on my computer.

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Don't break my pen.

89
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,080
I can't, I can't do Skype, I'm frustrated, no.

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,400
I can't do Skype on my home computer like I can on the one here in the studio.

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,560
So we weren't able to do our little thing, so I don't know what we're going to do.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,080
We'll figure it out, we're smart people.

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Just in time for Cataclysm, how appropriate.

94
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Are you smart fellers?

95
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Huh?

96
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,640
Are you smart fellers or fart smellers?

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,860
Shut up.

98
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,900
Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki, and how was your gaming week?

99
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
It was fine.

100
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,720
I got my iPod finally, so I downloaded a bunch of stuff on there.

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,080
And let's see, I tried a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies, because I have yet to jump into

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
that.

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
It's pretty fun.

104
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,480
Hopefully going to play a little bit more than that, other than like two minutes worth.

105
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,920
And then, what else did I play?

106
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,000
I played some of the Mirror's Edge game on the iPhone, which is kind of neat, very simplistic,

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,040
but it still has that kind of same look as the full game.

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,200
Fruit Ninja, because that's really easy and casual.

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,480
So I actually kind of downloaded that, because it's actually one of the ones that is supported

110
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,640
by Game Center, so I thought it'd be neat to try out.

111
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:08,020
And of course I had to download Robot Unicorn Attack, because, well, I don't think I need

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,080
to explain myself there.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,600
It's so surreal to me that you're coming in here and playing with your little iPod now.

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,360
This is after like a good, I don't know, eight years of just Apple hatred that you see on

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
this show.

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
No, I still hate Apple.

117
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,960
But you're sitting there playing with your iPod, like, hey Rob, let me see what apps

118
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,520
you have, because I'm going to say, oh, Jamie, let me see your phone.

119
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,080
It's just really funny to me.

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,880
Well, okay, it's very convenient for browsing the web.

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,140
For example, Nellie's mom came over, and she's like, I need the 800 number for AAA.

122
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,400
And Nellie was like, okay, well let me boot up my laptop, and I'm like, okay, hold on,

123
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,480
let me real quickly just turn my iPod on, hit the web browser, done.

124
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,680
There's a AAA app that will actually put your little ID card in there and everything, and

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
you can actually file a request over the application.

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Well, it wasn't, she didn't need, it was kind of weird because it was someone hit her that

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,640
had AAA, so she needed a number to call them, got it.

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,720
So yeah, so it's neat, and then the other thing that I got with that is I got a Virgin

129
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,120
Mobile MiFi 2200, which is a 3G hotspot.

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,800
In fact, I'm actually using that right now to connect to the web.

131
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,000
It's literally, it is smaller than the iPod that I have right now, but it works pretty

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,680
well, and it's like 40 bucks a month flat, so I'm kind of digging that a little bit.

133
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,500
Console Games, of course, played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's just a given.

134
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Really ain't playing too much else other than that, because I just haven't had time.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Wife's keeping me busy with keeping the baby, you know, out of her hair, and unfortunately

136
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,720
that gives me like no time to do anything, so it's just, I'm really sad because I wanted

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
to work on stuff this weekend, and instead I had to go shop for groceries for like two

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,800
hours and run a bunch of errands, and then I come back home and she's like, I've been

139
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,240
sitting here with the baby for all this time and he won't stop crying, here you take him.

140
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,640
It's like, oh yeah, I haven't been doing anything at all, I've just been, you know, playing

141
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
around.

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,760
That's what you get for making babies.

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Breeders.

144
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,480
So, yeah, so that's basically all I've done this week is mainly download a ton of apps.

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,320
I've spent way too much money on apps, so that's for sure, I gotta cut back on that.

146
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,800
This little 3G router thingy-ma-bobber you have, what is this again, a Virgin mobile?

147
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,600
Well, it's called a MiFi 2200, they have them through Virgin, they have them through Sprint,

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,840
AT&T I think even, and, but the plan that's the cheapest is actually the Virgin plan,

149
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:51,840
and it piggybacks on the Sprint network, and it's flat $40, and it's, you know, there's

150
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,000
no plan, so if you wanna use it, you pay 40 bucks and you get a full month worth of unlimited

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,480
bandwidth, unlimited data, whatever.

152
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,200
Now what surprised me about that is when I was looking at those things online, I thought

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,120
they were the size of like a normal router, was my impression, but that thing is smaller

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,320
than your phone, or not the phone, well, than an iPhone.

155
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Yeah.

156
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
It's crazy.

157
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,040
And, you know, literally I slip that into my back pocket and I just play around with

158
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
it.

159
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Jamie's gonna take a picture of it for the website.

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,620
Put your thing next to it to compare sizes, because I was really impressed at how tiny

161
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,960
that stinkin' thing is, it's crazy.

162
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,560
Yeah, so, um, yeah, it's, it's really small, um, and it's kinda cool about it though is

163
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,920
SeeSense, you know, I have like almost like a ghetto iPhone with this, because I have

164
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,120
a program to, uh, send free text messages, so I can do that, and I have like a number

165
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,520
that's associated with that now, so people can text me if they want to, um, and...

166
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,480
You should give out that number here on the show and see what kind of text messages you

167
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,720
get during the week.

168
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,880
I really don't use it.

169
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,720
Hi, Loki, I'm in the potty!

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,440
I think that would be quite foolish.

171
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:01,400
Uh, yeah, so I have that, and then, um, I don't know, I've just, I've been downloading

172
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,100
a bunch of junk, because that's what I, I sit there, you know, I have the baby in my

173
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,240
arm, and I'm sitting there just kinda browsing the internet, and I'm like, okay, hmm, what

174
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,680
apps could I possibly need, um, oh, I know, they just talked about a police scanner app

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,120
on TV, I'm gonna download that, okay, uh...

176
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
He's an alcoholic.

177
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,840
Pretty much, it's...

178
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,080
And then in two months the novelty will wear off, and I'll be like, ugh.

179
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,320
But hey, it doesn't matter though, because I didn't really pay any money for this, although

180
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,300
I did spend a lot of money on apps, so Apple still wins in this.

181
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,540
Going back to our chatroom and chat.orangelandrader.com, they always make A-plus comments such as this

182
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
one.

183
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,400
Alf in chat says, now Loki's butt will have cancer, and I'm assuming that's from the router.

184
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I don't always...

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,760
Being in your butt, or next to your butt, or wherever it is, in close proximity to your

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
butt, will somehow give you butt cancer.

187
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,800
Well, I can't really use it too much, you know, in my back pocket, because, um, if I

188
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,040
sit down it turns it off, so, uh, that's not good, um, but you know, that's where I store

189
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
it for now.

190
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,440
I don't store it in my butt, but my, but my pocket, yes.

191
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,480
But if somebody did store it in their butt, they'd be like 3G everywhere they go.

192
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
But it's so cool though, because see, like, not only can I...

193
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,640
You can name the network Rob's butt.

194
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,560
Not only can I connect to that, um, but other peop- it can sort of port up to five devices

195
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
at once.

196
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,600
Um, I'd imagine it'd be very slow with five devices connected to it, but...

197
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,040
Hey, I'm connected to your butt right now!

198
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
Alright, um, let's introduce the guests, because they're dying to make a comment, and, uh,

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,240
it's been forever, really, since these two have been on the show, but they're quite the

200
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,740
duo, and if you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, I'm sure you've heard

201
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,600
these guys on the show, they're loved by the masses.

202
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Not really, I just say that to talk about...

203
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,640
Say hello to Rice Princess!

204
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
How are you?

205
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm good.

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
So if you put it up...

207
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Wait, can we hear you?

208
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Oh, it's muted.

209
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Hi.

210
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
La la la.

211
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Jerk.

212
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Hi, how are you?

213
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I'm good.

214
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,600
So if you put the router up your butt, what if you accidentally poop it out, and it goes

215
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
in the water?

216
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
That...

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Wouldn't that break it?

218
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Maybe it might.

219
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Have to change the network to big dump.

220
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
It might.

221
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Oh, and hi.

222
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Alright.

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,880
Also, say hello to the one and only...

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
The doctor is back!

225
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm the doctor!

226
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
How are you?

227
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Pretty good, pretty good.

228
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,960
And I just wanted you to say, Rob, there's- Rob's butt has been a network for years and

229
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
years and years.

230
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,680
That's pretty much the only com- Only, uh, yeah, I'm seeing the Sonic Screwdriver, which

231
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,760
would also work in Rob's butt, so...

232
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
So I'm gonna play with the Sonic Screwdriver.

233
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Here you go, Rice Princess.

234
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,280
You know, I am not comfortable with how much of the discussion on this show is about my

235
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
butt.

236
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
I, uh...

237
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm not okay with that.

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
It's your own fault.

239
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
It really is.

240
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Yeah.

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Alright.

242
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Well, what have you- what the hell have you been up to, Rice Princess?

243
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,040
Were you- you have been on the show in like a year, it seems like, because I don't think

244
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,000
you've been since we've been here at Studio Sakura.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,920
I haven't, and I'm kind of insulted that you didn't notice that the doctor and I are wearing-

246
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,240
You are wearing Madison Castlevania shirts, because it's old school and new school.

247
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,480
Yeah, mine's better, but- Isn't today a special day in the, uh, relationship between you and

248
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
the doctor?

249
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, it's the first time we had sex, because he's straight.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And me?

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Really?

252
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I thought it was- Yes.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,860
No, September- September 9th, 2000- Oh my gosh.

254
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
Was the night we all met.

255
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Oh my gosh.

256
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Yeah.

257
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,640
I thought it was Irene I met in like November.

258
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Yeah, and then we all- we all went back to your apartment and played Wheel of Fortune.

259
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Good times.

260
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
In Roseville.

261
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
And butt sex.

262
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,320
Rob's network was on that night.

263
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Shut up.

264
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,160
And I've got a- I've got a gift to regale you with.

265
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
You can open later.

266
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
You didn't have to bring gifts.

267
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Well, that's alright.

268
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
But I'll take it.

269
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
It's poop.

270
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Yay.

271
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,600
So you're wearing matching castle- well, they're not matching Castlevania shirts, it's old school

272
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,920
Castlevania new school.

273
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,520
Mine's Symphony of the Night, so mine's automatically cooler.

274
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Yeah, his is old school.

275
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
But his is great.

276
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Yeah, no.

277
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
I like his too.

278
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,000
That means we have to push the start key now.

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh yeah.

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Alright.

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Where is the start key?

282
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm not gonna ask where that is.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But where is the start key is the question.

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Finding is the game, actually.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,320
That's- that's the other game.

286
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
That's a scary game.

287
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah.

288
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,200
Since you guys haven't been on the show in a while, we actually have some new listeners.

289
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,520
Believe it or not, like people actually like subscribe to the show and stay subscribed.

290
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,200
Is it the same five people under different names?

291
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,660
No, we've got emails and like people are like, hey, I just started listening and my first

292
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,360
show was the fuck show and I'm like, really?

293
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,280
And you didn't unsubscribe after that?

294
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Yeah.

295
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
That's amazing.

296
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
You're weird.

297
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,800
So for those that maybe haven't heard you on the show before, what kind of video games

298
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
are you into?

299
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
What do you like to play?

300
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,760
What- what- what types of stuff you've been playing right now, Rice Princess?

301
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,480
I don't play anything now except for WoW because, you know, I have a love-hate relationship

302
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
with it.

303
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,360
But I like, um, like Super Nintendo games, Nintendo games, like stuff- older stuff.

304
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Retro stuff.

305
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,200
Yeah, I don't- I haven't really played much on the newer gen.

306
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,640
What would you say is a totally underrated retro game?

307
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Clash at Demonhead.

308
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I knew you were going to say that.

309
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Of course you knew I was going to say that.

310
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Duh.

311
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Why is that game underrated?

312
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,520
Because it's fucking awesome and no one's played it.

313
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,960
Did you- did you get a little hot when you saw that the band in the Scott Pilgrim movie

314
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,320
was called Clash at Demonhead?

315
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,720
Yes, because I was probably the only person in the theater who's actually played that

316
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
game.

317
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
It was awesome.

318
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Yes.

319
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I liked it a lot.

320
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Yes.

321
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Good times.

322
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
What about you, Eddie?

323
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
How about The Doctor?

324
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
The Doctor, what types of games have you been playing lately?

325
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,480
Not much lately, because like The Rice Princess, I own a Wii, so I'm a very angry Wii player

326
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,120
because there's no games for it.

327
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,680
I looked at my Wii history for the past six months and it's just Netflix.

328
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,360
There's no games being played, but before that I had downloaded Cave Story in the virtual

329
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,760
console which is a really fun 8-bit style game.

330
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,880
So yeah, I like a lot of old school stuff.

331
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,000
I like the new stuff, I just don't like Halo and Call of Duty and stuff, so I like adventure

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,760
type games and there's not a lot of that on the Wii.

333
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,280
It's mostly a soccer mom console now.

334
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,720
What about Metroid Other M?

335
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
That was the big thing.

336
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,880
I've heard terrible reviews on that though, like I want to play it, but I've heard terrible

337
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
reviews.

338
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
I don't know what you guys think.

339
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm a little worried because it's supposed to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid and

340
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,320
I've heard a lot of awful things about it, but I've heard some really good things about

341
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
it, so I don't know.

342
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,880
I've heard play-wise, it's fantastic, story-wise, it's balls.

343
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,680
And not the good kind of balls.

344
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Ray D.N.

345
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,080
Silver Gun in our chat room says, I get it, says you should get Sin and Punishment 2.

346
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
I get it.

347
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
How about Sin and Punishment 2?

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,240
I don't know what the hell that is.

349
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
It's on the Wii!

350
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
It's Sin and Punishment.

351
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Okay, I still don't know what it is.

352
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Not you, him!

353
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Oh, fine.

354
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Screw you, it's for him.

355
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
It's a shooter.

356
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,920
Yeah, it's another shooter, which, you know, I'd play that if I wanted to go to sleep,

357
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
so.

358
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Alright, fine.

359
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,480
I don't trust the industry nowadays, because remember how they said Shattered Memories was

360
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
like the best game at E3?

361
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,840
Fucking worst game ever made.

362
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,600
Oh, I just want to punch Silent Hill.

363
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,640
What was wrong with Silent Hill Shattered Memories?

364
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Everything.

365
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
It wasn't a game.

366
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,360
It was just like, here, I'm going to poop on your face.

367
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,480
I don't remember the poop on your face scene, actually.

368
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,720
I remember it, because that's all that happened over and over.

369
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I don't.

370
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,520
Like, oh my gosh, oh, Alessa, it's you, poop on your face!

371
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,200
It's like, you son of a bitch, you got me again!

372
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,440
I thought it was going to be different this time, but no.

373
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
Did you and I play the same game?

374
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,040
Because I just remembered the snow and a lot of running.

375
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't remember.

376
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,760
You didn't see the tracks of shit everywhere?

377
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
No?

378
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
I don't.

379
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Okay.

380
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Yeah.

381
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,680
Maybe I got the director's cut or something, I don't know, but I got the shit on your face

382
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
version.

383
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Okay.

384
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I'll stop cussing now.

385
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Alright.

386
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
No, that's alright.

387
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
It's a family show.

388
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,520
Let's see.

389
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
My gaming week.

390
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Exposure!

391
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Exposure!

392
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Let's see.

393
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,760
What types of stuff did I play this week?

394
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Who cares?

395
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
No.

396
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Not a lot of news.

397
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Wow.

398
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Wow.

399
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Wow.

400
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,560
I played the WoW beta today because I finally got my character to copy over, so I was able

401
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,960
to look at the new zones.

402
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,800
Have you done any of the sillies or the flirts?

403
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
They are raunchy!

404
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
For the new?

405
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,880
Yeah, for goblins and wargons.

406
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I haven't.

407
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
I played a wargon at like level six, and I got all excited because female wargons showed

408
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,800
up this week, but you can make one and see what it looks like, but you can't actually

409
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
click the button that says create character.

410
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,240
Yeah, it says decline or whatever.

411
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
Yeah, invalid.

412
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,560
But it's not a PG-13 thing anymore.

413
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,520
It's like getting into R-rated material.

414
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,600
One of the female goblin, I think it's a flirt, was like, yeah, and then he asked me to go

415
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,840
up on him, and I'm just like, what the hell?

416
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
That's pretty funny.

417
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Maybe you're just getting too old.

418
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,400
No, but then there was another one where he's like, I've got something for you, and then

419
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
he just unzips his pants.

420
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
That's just straight up sexual.

421
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,600
That is not teenager stuff.

422
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,120
And then Rob was like, let's release the sassy squad, and he took his pants off.

423
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,520
Did I quit playing well at the wrong time?

424
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,960
I don't have the sassy squad anymore.

425
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm a paladin.

426
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I know.

427
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Boo.

428
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
But you have the sassy hair.

429
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,480
No, but Alan plays the boomkin now, so he has a sassy squad, but that's not what they're

430
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
called.

431
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,600
Not nearly as sassy as you're- No.

432
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,440
He actually is really good.

433
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,720
He really is a great boomkin.

434
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
He's a big fucking geek.

435
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm not just saying that because he's listening.

436
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,360
He knows what he's doing in that game.

437
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I don't know.

438
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
I just push three buttons.

439
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm a hunter, you know?

440
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,360
But he's like, oh, you just do this to raise your hit cap, and blah, blah, blah.

441
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm just like, what?

442
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,920
Speak English.

443
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,440
No, but here's the thing is that the beta, I started playing the beta today with my paladin

444
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,320
and going into some of the new Love Lady areas.

445
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,560
So I went to Mount Hijal, right, and started fighting some of the new monsters.

446
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
Wow got hard.

447
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
It did.

448
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,480
But all of a sudden, I went from having two heals to having six, and I don't know which

449
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,960
one to cast, and then my rep paladin is all like, oh, now you got to have holy power to

450
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
do all this shit, and oh my God, they changed everything.

451
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
It hurts.

452
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,200
They did, and Extifer, our buddy Extifer, he tried to heal for one of the raids, and

453
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,440
he's like, I couldn't keep anyone above 50% health, and blah, blah, blah.

454
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm like, I don't really know what that means because I'm not a healer, but that sucks,

455
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I guess.

456
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I don't know.

457
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,720
You make it sound like it's terrible, so I guess it is, but yeah, he was saying it was

458
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
really hard.

459
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
But you know what I have?

460
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Photon torpedoes.

461
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Nice.

462
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Whatever.

463
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Well, I've got quarantined torpedoes.

464
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Whoa.

465
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Actually, I'm using transphasic torpedoes.

466
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Ah, I hate you.

467
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
All right, I didn't...

468
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Star Trek Online?

469
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Why aren't you playing Star Trek Online?

470
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Maybe you're bigger.

471
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Yeah, yeah.

472
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Because he doesn't play MMOs.

473
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Oh, he doesn't play MMOs.

474
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
He tried playing WoW for like a week.

475
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
You know what he did in WoW?

476
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,400
He would hide in the Moonwell ponds and do shadow meld, and when someone would run by,

477
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
he'd go, boo, and come out of shadow meld.

478
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,720
That was the extent of his experience in WoW.

479
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
Why didn't he play on a roleplay server?

480
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
You know why?

481
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,560
Because his computer lagged so hard, he would run in place like eight times.

482
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,400
I had my computer at like 200 megabytes of RAM, and so it was like, I couldn't play WoW,

483
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
so it was terrible.

484
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
So that's what I did.

485
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,720
You know, I had to upgrade my graphics card and everything to run Star Trek Online decently.

486
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Oh, really?

487
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Yeah.

488
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,800
And the chat room's all bitching, like, oh, I don't understand what you're talking about.

489
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
You lost me after Pally.

490
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,840
I'm going to go play Shattered Memories and get shit on on my face.

491
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
So let me move on.

492
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Just kidding.

493
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,300
Oh, and then SSG100Matt says, at least it's better than Final Fantasy XI.

494
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,640
That's totally true.

495
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
That's not saying much.

496
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
What about XIV, huh?

497
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Oh, that gem.

498
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Let's not go there.

499
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,560
All right, and then I played some iPhone games.

500
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,160
Actually, speaking of MMOs, I played a new iPhone MMO that's so much better than the

501
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,400
one I played last week.

502
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,460
This one is called I forget the name.

503
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
It's called Legends.

504
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
Wow.

505
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,240
I think that's short for something else.

506
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,880
Player Legends or Play Legends or something.

507
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,000
It's free.

508
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's neat.

509
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,160
It's got 3D.

510
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,400
It sounds unique and not generic at all.

511
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Not at all.

512
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
But you know what?

513
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
It was free.

514
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
So I'm not going to complain.

515
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
And then I played Netflix.

516
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
You played Netflix?

517
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Yes.

518
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Alan and I started watching Hoarders.

519
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Oh, my God.

520
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,960
Isn't that a terribly addictive show?

521
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,520
It's like you feel bad, but it's like you can't.

522
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
The chocolate chips, Alan.

523
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
They're chocolate chips.

524
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Oh, my God.

525
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
It's horrible.

526
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,800
Well, I watch Hoarders because A, Alan likes to joke about how that's going to be us in

527
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
like 20 years.

528
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,080
But B, like it actually makes me feel better about myself because if you'd asked me before

529
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,480
I'd watch that show, like Rob, are you a hoarder, I probably would have said, yeah, I'm a little

530
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
bit of a hoarder.

531
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,960
But after watching that show, I'm like, no, no, absolutely not.

532
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Oh, hell no.

533
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,080
I'd never let it get that bad.

534
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Yeah.

535
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
It's pretty bad on that show.

536
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
I don't know.

537
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,440
You're just getting a little, I'm going to say I've known you for a while, you know.

538
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,920
Some of the things on that show are really, I would never let an animal die under all

539
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
the stuff.

540
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
That you know of.

541
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
I know.

542
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Yeah.

543
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
All right.

544
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Anyhow.

545
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
This is why Rob doesn't have a kitty.

546
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Yeah.

547
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Or Zach and Kelly.

548
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Remember them?

549
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
That was different.

550
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,360
That was different, huh?

551
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,640
They had, they didn't die under the weight of crap around the house or anything.

552
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,920
They actually had their own little tank that they could swim around in.

553
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,000
It's not my fault.

554
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,600
One of them decided to swim right up the filter and die.

555
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,160
And what happened to the other one?

556
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I flushed it down the toilet.

557
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I don't remember.

558
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Was it alive when you did?

559
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
No.

560
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
No.

561
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
The other one died of sadness.

562
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,560
I didn't feed him for a week and he was so sad.

563
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
He died.

564
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,960
Well, I mean, if your little fish friend just decided to seppuku up the filter when you're

565
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
just...

566
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I don't think he's seppuku'd.

567
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,520
I think you bought the wrong one.

568
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
You murderer!

569
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,240
I bought the tank at Walmart.

570
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,360
That was a death wish right there.

571
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,000
We can't talk about this anymore.

572
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm getting so sad.

573
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Good.

574
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm detecting trauma in this room.

575
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Uh oh.

576
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
So housekeeping.

577
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Hi.

578
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,080
If you like our show, you should join our Facebook club at facebook.com slash orange

579
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
lounge radio.

580
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,960
We also have a Twitter because that's all the cool kids do these days is tweet.

581
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,040
And we have a Twitter at, not a Twitter fan, the doctor.

582
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
I see you over there.

583
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,240
I said Twitter and you were like, no, I like the, uh, the Futurama spooper was like, here's

584
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,800
a twit now.

585
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
It's true.

586
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Twitter.com slash olr.

587
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,560
That's where you can go.

588
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Anyhow.

589
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I do not have any cute shows on this game.

590
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,920
How about video game news, actual bonafide video game news, cause the Tokyo game show

591
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
happened this week.

592
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
So there's a lot of news out of there.

593
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,520
But we're not starting there tonight actually.

594
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
What a horrible segue.

595
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,080
Where are we starting tonight, Loki?

596
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,000
Ah, yes, we're starting with, this is funny cause I could have been affected by this,

597
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,440
but thanks to procrastination, uh, I was not.

598
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,720
The MMO APB, or what I like to call it, Grand Theft Auto the MMO.

599
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,720
More like Saintsboro the MMO, but you know, whatever.

600
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,240
It was a cops and robbers MMO game developed by Realtime Worlds who did the wonderful game

601
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:43,040
Crackdown and it launched in the US on June 29th and basically had players playing both

602
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,280
the enforcers and criminals and you know, you'd go around creating crime or stopping

603
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,760
crime and leveled up and so on and it was one of the big features about it was the wonderful

604
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
character editor.

605
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,880
I mean you could literally create all sorts of stuff with it.

606
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:10,440
But unfortunately, I guess it didn't do too well cause it's closed down already.

607
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,040
Realtime Worlds faced massive layoffs last month and I guess before going into administration,

608
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,720
which is I guess the UK equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy.

609
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:32,800
So yeah, they weren't doing too well and the quote on the official website is, APB had

610
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,200
a fantastic journey but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end.

611
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,920
Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service

612
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,840
running, APB is coming to a close.

613
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,280
It has been a pleasure working on APB and with all of its players together we will be

614
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,080
building an absolutely amazing game, or we were building an absolutely amazing game and

615
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,360
for that we thank you.

616
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,480
You guys are awesome.

617
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,360
And the thousands of you that paid for this game just got F'd in the A, right?

618
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Uh, yeah.

619
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm not hearing a lot about the backlash.

620
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I mean, is it just because literally no one bought this game or, I mean, it seems so strange

621
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,800
to me that an MMO could just get away with shutting down after three months.

622
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,640
It wasn't if you're really an MMO.

623
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,320
I mean, it's barely an MMO, especially by today's standards for multiplayer games.

624
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,680
I mean, it was a hundred player instances basically that you got to play in.

625
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,720
Can you play it offline though?

626
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
No.

627
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,780
Well, so if you dropped 60 bucks on this game just three months ago, you paid $20 a month

628
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,000
and then some for bleh.

629
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

630
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,760
That stinks.

631
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,480
I kind of like tabula rasa member.

632
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,880
Well tabula rasa lasted at least a good year.

633
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah.

634
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,320
I mean three months is, and it's, that's sad.

635
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,800
I'd rather get a hooker.

636
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Exactly.

637
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,680
Think of all the things you could have bought for that 60 bucks.

638
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
I don't know.

639
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
I guess it's just kind of sad.

640
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,840
Remember APB last for three months, but an STD lasts forever.

641
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Exactly.

642
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,440
Do we have any listeners in the chat room who actually bought APB and are kind of pissed

643
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
about this closure?

644
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,520
I mean, I don't know if any of our listeners are the type that get low key.

645
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,440
You, you talked about this game an awful lot before it came out and then you, you didn't.

646
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,120
I mean, did you even get into it?

647
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,360
I was in the beta, so I played it for a little bit.

648
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
It was okay.

649
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,040
It's just, it was one of those things I didn't want to buy it cause I didn't think I had

650
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,520
time to play it and if I had, I definitely wouldn't have had time to play it.

651
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,400
So that's why I didn't buy it.

652
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,560
It was fun to check it out.

653
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,240
It's too bad because I think it would have worked better as a console game, you know,

654
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,420
with an actual, it's just like something that should have been like a, as a Saints Row type

655
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,040
of thing or something like that.

656
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,360
You know, have the actual main storyline and everything and have like some really fleshed

657
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,800
out online mode where you can play, you know, either the cops or the enforcers and level

658
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,320
up and have a really cool, you know, character editor and stuff like that.

659
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,560
That's what I could have saw this being, but it wasn't.

660
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,960
However, all may not be lost cause apparently Epic Games is interesting, or is interested

661
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,120
in buying the rights to the game.

662
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,480
So maybe we'll see, you know, APB come back in some other form.

663
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,400
It'd be interesting.

664
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:20,480
I guess Eurogamer was reporting this saying that, according to the BBC, source close to

665
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,800
the development team, a few companies are showing interest in picking up APB's rights

666
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,540
and apparently one of those companies is Epic Games, of course the company behind the Gears

667
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,120
of War and Unreal Tournament series.

668
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,200
And also adding to the speculation, Eurogamer, they were saying citing Dundee development

669
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:47,160
source in real time, I guess was based in Dundee, Scotland, that Dave Jones, the real

670
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:54,720
time world's boss, and Epic were, is quite the talking, or is quite the talking point

671
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
in the town.

672
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,960
He says he and Mr. Rain are good chums and have worked together on many levels for years

673
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,200
and years and years, and he's not gonna raise much money and staff here in the near future,

674
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,160
so it's sounding like that maybe Epic will buy them.

675
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,560
I guess that's good, but still, I mean what type of precedence is this set for the future?

676
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,400
Like I'm still just picturing, you know, thousands, well at least hundreds of angry gamers that

677
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,600
bought this game, tens of angry gamers that bought this game that feel really screwed

678
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,120
about it closing, you know what I mean?

679
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,000
Okay this is the first time that's ever happened on The Sims that the shirt just disappears.

680
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,720
Dark Soccer doesn't prefer to actually listen to the show when it's going on.

681
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,680
She plays The Sims while the show's going on, and we all look over there, like at the

682
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,840
same time, don't know why, we just all kind of look over at her computer, she's dressing

683
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,400
some character right now, and it's a female character she's dressing, and we look over

684
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:59,160
there, and no top, no top on, just titties hanging out, what kind of game are you playing

685
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
over there?

686
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,340
Oh no, I tried to change her shirt and all of a sudden her boobs just pop out.

687
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,920
That's what happens.

688
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,320
Question in our chatroom at chat.orangeslaundry.com, or more of a statement from our buddy Segg,

689
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,980
I haven't seen him in chat in forever, hi Segg, watch it become like Uru missed online

690
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,560
and never die.

691
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,020
Missed online got resurrected about three or four times.

692
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
That's true.

693
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,880
It would be neat, it was alright, but once again, you know, doing 100 player instances

694
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,640
is not really an MMO, I mean, look at MAG, I mean, that's, I think, what, got 128 players

695
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
at a time?

696
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,560
And they all call it an MMO, they call it like an MMO, an action game I guess, or something

697
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
like that.

698
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,880
I think this is all an elaborate scheme to justify the online pass, because the people

699
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,800
who made this game didn't charge for the online pass, did they?

700
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,400
And so they're gonna say, because we weren't charging the $10 premium, we had to shut down

701
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
the servers.

702
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,360
But that doesn't make any sense, why would they charge for an online pass if they're

703
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,080
charging for online anyways?

704
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,920
Oh, I'm sorry, you have to, they don't have a used market for PC titles.

705
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Well why not, what's stopping them these days?

706
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm sorry, you gotta pay, you gotta pay another $10 for online access.

707
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,280
I can't play without online access.

708
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
That's too bad.

709
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,840
You know, every time we play these games, especially the online ones, we have to accept

710
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,840
like a, you know, terms of conditions, a user agreement basically, right?

711
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,680
When are we gonna make the company sign the company agreement when we buy their games?

712
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, if I plop 60 bucks on this game, you need to keep the damn servers up for at

713
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
least a year, or you know, XYZ.

714
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,000
Unrealistic, yes, but this, I don't know, I just think this is a bad precedence if this

715
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,060
just kind of slips away and people are just like, oh well, it was a crappy game anyway.

716
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,400
You know, oh well.

717
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,100
I think they should get their money back, or people that bought it should get their

718
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:55,560
money back, but unfortunately the company has no money to give back, so, oh well, too

719
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
bad.

720
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
You do.

721
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Live and learn.

722
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,760
Maybe if you have one of those like best buy replacement plans, you can go take the game

723
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,560
back, say hey don't work no more, I don't know, good luck, we'll see if that works.

724
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,980
Something that might have worked a little better had it come out would have been this

725
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,200
patent that was discovered by Sony last week.

726
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,240
It was a last gen console adapter.

727
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,920
Could explain why there was never PS2 backwards compatibility after of course the very, very

728
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,180
first PlayStation 3 console.

729
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,320
It was removed from the console pretty quickly to help cut down on cost.

730
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,240
Then there were rumors that it was going to come out on the download service, the PlayStation

731
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,720
network, we would see PlayStation 2 games, but that never seemed to happen either.

732
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,320
Well, apparently one of the tech sites over in Japan, Gigazine, discovered a patent that

733
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,720
was filed by Sony Japan back in February of 09, which described an adapter, and it would

734
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,760
serve as a bridge for older gen games to be played on a current gen console, and honestly

735
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,160
when I look at the picture it looks like you are attaching a PlayStation 2 to your PlayStation

736
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
3.

737
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,240
That is retarded.

738
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Is it bad?

739
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
I still kind of want one.

740
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Gigazine.

741
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
No, no, no, here's what they would do too.

742
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,760
They would charge like $150 for that, you know.

743
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Even though the PS2 is $100.

744
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Exactly.

745
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Because they don't learn.

746
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,280
It's just like, you know, oh hey, we're going to release this system, we're going to call

747
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,600
it the PSP Go, and yeah, we know that the regular PSP is out right now for like $150

748
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,640
and that it can play UMD discs, but this new PSP that we're releasing, it's not going to

749
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
be able to play UMD discs.

750
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,160
You're going to have to download all your titles, oh, and we're going to charge $200

751
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
for it.

752
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Oh, I'm sorry, no, $250 for it.

753
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Smart.

754
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Now something to keep in mind, just to be technical.

755
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Oh, and a PS3.

756
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
That's only $299.

757
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,880
Pat doesn't specifically say it's for PlayStation 2 games.

758
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,400
It's just for older games, but if you think about it, okay, PlayStation 3 already plays

759
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,520
PlayStation 1 games, hmm, I wonder why this is left.

760
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,240
No, no, no, you need this additional adapter to play PlayStation 2.

761
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,040
No, it's going to play Dreamcast games and Sega CD games.

762
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,360
It plays HD DVD, who knew?

763
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,040
Wow, that's backwards compatible.

764
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,880
All right, so, yeah, it doesn't sound like this would be too incredibly popular if it

765
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
came out.

766
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I don't know.

767
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,120
If it was the right price, I'd probably buy it.

768
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
You know why?

769
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,600
To save on the shelf space.

770
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Because I don't...

771
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,120
How do you figure?

772
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,960
Because if I have to get a PlayStation 2 out to hook up, that's a whole nother AC adapter,

773
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,840
that's a whole nother set of RGB cords, that's a whole nother...

774
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,040
Girlfriend, you just lazy.

775
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
You lazy.

776
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Yeah, pretty much.

777
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Pretty much.

778
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Actually, you're wrong.

779
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,120
It's not another set of RGB cords.

780
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,000
It's actually the exact same set.

781
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,280
But you have to move it from the PS3 to PS2.

782
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
You know what?

783
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
They probably just spray painted a PS2.

784
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Well, that's definitely worth $150.

785
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
It is.

786
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,040
They're just like, oh, let's change this to an off gray.

787
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:57,720
Or you can spend, I don't know, $10 and get one of those stupid console switching devices.

788
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,280
What if this little bridge actually made the games better, too?

789
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Like I don't...

790
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,560
Obviously, you can't change the games themselves.

791
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Let's play Big Rigs now.

792
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,760
Keep in mind, Rob, Mythbusters did prove that you can polish a turd.

793
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
But it...

794
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Ew.

795
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:23,680
This screeching hall was brought to you by Dark Sakura and her lovely insights.

796
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,920
What if it like, up-res the resolution of the game, and...

797
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,880
Yeah, that'd be so amazing.

798
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
If only a console did that already.

799
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,360
Oh, yeah, the PlayStation 3 does.

800
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
That's so crazy.

801
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,240
But not for PS2 games.

802
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,000
It did if you got one of the launch systems.

803
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, too bad not a lot of people bought one of the launch systems.

804
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Well, you should have done that.

805
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Lower your standards.

806
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Don't give me $700 or whatever the hell those things cost back then.

807
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
They were crazy.

808
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
$599 US dollars.

809
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Well...

810
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't know.

811
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Alright, I'm over it.

812
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You guys are mean.

813
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's stupid that you know it, Rob.

814
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Everybody's picking on me.

815
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,720
The best part about that, though, is I have one of those systems that plays PlayStation

816
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,160
2 games, and I don't play any PlayStation 2 games in it at all.

817
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,360
I would play Final Fantasy XII,.hack, because I never did beat it, and Magic Pen Gel.

818
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,600
But don't you have a PS2 already?

819
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,240
In a box somewhere.

820
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,400
We've used ours to play PS2 games.

821
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,360
I don't want to actually look for my PS2.

822
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,520
I'm gonna go buy this thing for my PS3.

823
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
You don't understand.

824
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
No, I don't.

825
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,440
A, there's no guarantee the PS2 still works.

826
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,800
B, it's a whole other set of cords that you have to hook into the back of the TV.

827
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,600
God, you must be the laziest person.

828
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,840
There's no guarantee that it works, so I'm not even gonna try.

829
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,720
I'm just gonna drop this hundred-whatever-the-fuck dollars on this thing.

830
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,600
You were here the other week, when we had the 32X hooked up, and that's a whole bunch

831
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
of cables.

832
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,720
Yeah, but you guys are a special kind of crazy.

833
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
You know what?

834
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,440
We're the kind of crazy that likes to not be lazy.

835
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,800
How many inputs are on the back of your TV?

836
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,760
I mean, seriously, you don't even need to hook up anything.

837
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,280
You just plug them in to begin with, and oh, it's hooked up at the same time.

838
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,920
I hit input on my remote, and wow!

839
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,320
The power of PlayStation 2, brought to my TV!

840
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,000
I think that my TV has something like three HDMI things, and then a bunch of AV, and like

841
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,080
some S-video, and like the little one that you use the Switch for.

842
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Well that's nice.

843
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,680
My TV's from Costco, so I don't think it probably has.

844
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,760
Our TV is from Costco.

845
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,340
That is not a valid excuse.

846
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,640
I've rendered your excuse invalid.

847
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,400
I swear my thing only has like two inputs, and an HDMI.

848
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Well yours sucks.

849
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
You should return it.

850
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm sorry that your thing only has two inputs, that's why.

851
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Next story!

852
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Next topic.

853
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,280
Well, how about, um, some more PS3 news.

854
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,640
There is going to be a new system update 3.42.

855
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,080
Why can't they just give them regular numbers instead of points, you know?

856
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,440
Why can't it be update number four?

857
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Update number five?

858
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
No.

859
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,120
Because right now they'd be at update number 62.

860
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
They're bitches.

861
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,840
Because the whole number updates are for major, major, major updates, and this is just, hey,

862
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,800
we're adding Blu-ray, or, you know.

863
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,720
Well, the next one is 3.5, because we just got 3.42.

864
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,320
And this one is going to add 3D Blu-ray movie support, since it can already do 3D with games.

865
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:35,320
And that date is actually out for the Japanese market on September 21st, but I guess it's

866
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
going to be after?

867
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,840
And you'll be able to watch tens of movies with that.

868
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,000
Or like, literally I think there's less than 20 movies out there that have 3D Blu-ray.

869
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Can I just say, fuck 3D.

870
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Like, I'm so over it.

871
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,520
We actually have one of those 3D TVs and 3D Blu-rays at our work, because our Sony rep

872
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,320
came in and we had this really nice Samsung TV up on the wall, and he's like, that's not

873
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
a Sony TV.

874
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
I'm getting you a Sony TV.

875
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
And it's going to be a 3D TV.

876
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,960
Tell your Sony rep to get me a TV.

877
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,120
Do you watch Avatar?

878
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,180
No, well, we can't.

879
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
That's not 3D Blu-ray.

880
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,040
Like, seriously, the only 3D-

881
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,400
Because that will be in the super extended Uber James Cameron's cock Blu-ray edition.

882
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,840
Well, okay, well, until then, though, all we have is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

883
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,180
That's like seriously the only damn movie that's in 3D.

884
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,600
Which is also James Cameron's cock.

885
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Just by the way, don't-

886
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
His meaty balls.

887
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,400
Cloudy with a Chance of Balls.

888
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
Cameron balls.

889
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,880
Don't watch Resident Evil Afterlife, and especially don't watch it in 3D.

890
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
It was awesome.

891
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Why didn't you like that?

892
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
I want to see it.

893
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
You're kidding, right?

894
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,020
No, I liked it.

895
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
You're being facetious.

896
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Tell me you're being facetious.

897
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
Tell me.

898
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
My head's gonna explode.

899
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
No.

900
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,960
But, no, that would be one of the only movies that I would actually want to go see in 3D,

901
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
because you know it's gonna be ridiculous.

902
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
You know?

903
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Okay, did you go see it in 3D?

904
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,840
It's just like going to an amusement park.

905
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Okay.

906
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
What did you not like about it?

907
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,200
Well, okay, the movie itself was fucking ridiculous and stupid.

908
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,280
The 3D was obviously the added on 3D.

909
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
It wasn't shot in 3D.

910
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
It was shot in 3D.

911
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
It was?

912
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Yeah.

913
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,920
They actually, even when they were writing the script, they were writing with 3D in mind.

914
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,000
When they were writing the script of Dawn of the Dead.

915
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,960
They used the same cameras as Avatar did.

916
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
It was this big deal.

917
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Wow.

918
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
No, but, okay.

919
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
That's cool.

920
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,900
We actually, we went and saw that, I went and saw that actually on, uh, last week, um,

921
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,900
with the D-Box seats.

922
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,240
I don't know if you've heard about those.

923
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,780
The motion seats that actually move and rumble and stuff.

924
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
It was cool.

925
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,780
Okay.

926
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Well, that might have added to it.

927
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,780
And here's the thing, though.

928
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,880
I don't really play the Resident Evil games, so for me, this movie is kind of like, hey,

929
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,900
look, it's almost like The Matrix, but not, you know?

930
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,000
So I don't know if the storyline ruined it for you, because I could, I couldn't care,

931
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
you know?

932
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes.

933
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The storyline was stupid.

934
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,600
And, okay, the extent of the 3D stuff was just, oh, look at this blood flying in your

935
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
face.

936
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Oh, look at this building.

937
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,420
It's crumbling, and some of the crumbles are falling in your face.

938
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,440
There was nothing, like, exciting about it.

939
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,960
Maybe I'm just an old crotchety woman that doesn't like 3D, which is entirely possible.

940
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,360
There was a lot of gimmicky stuff in there, like, a lot of, like, throwing stuff at the

941
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
camera.

942
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,600
Hey, I'm throwing my glasses at the camera.

943
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,360
No, but that's, like, one of the only movies that I would go, okay, that's in 3D.

944
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
That makes sense.

945
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
But, like, Eat, Pray, Love.

946
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,800
I mean, that doesn't need to be in 3D.

947
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Was that really in 3D?

948
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,600
I'm gonna pray.

949
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,840
And I was extending my folded hands forward.

950
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,720
No, and just the movie itself was really stupid.

951
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,560
Like, literally, it was Dawn of the Dead, except with, like, Resident Evil people.

952
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Oh, geez, spoilers.

953
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
Oh, my God.

954
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
You've seen it before.

955
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,320
Didn't we go through this whole 3D craze back in the 80s, with, like, Jaws 3D?

956
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,960
I don't know.

957
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,440
I was, like, five.

958
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:57,960
Well, I think, okay, right now, Sony, they were kind of bad for doing it.

959
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,000
Before with, like, the PlayStation 3, when it first came out, it was, like, $600, and

960
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,880
they're like, well, that's because that's Blu-ray in it.

961
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,080
Well, everyone complained, I don't give a fuck, it's $600.

962
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,680
I'm not buying it.

963
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,320
It's because they're kind of jumping, they're trying to push the technology too much.

964
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,680
Just like 3D TV, I'm glad you're supporting 3D with your games, and I'm glad you're supporting

965
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,760
3D Blu-ray, because probably you have a little bit of an investment in it since, I don't

966
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,000
know, you have a lot of Blu-ray stuff, you are your own movie company and whatnot.

967
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,440
So obviously, they're trying to invest some of that in there, but it's really not viable

968
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,880
now to buy a 3D TV or a 3D Blu-ray player, because there's hardly any content for it.

969
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,200
And if you just wait, it's going to get damn cheaper anyways, and there's probably something

970
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
better going to come out.

971
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,280
You know, they're going to come out with TVs that don't require stupid glasses on you.

972
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,640
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

973
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,840
Salacious Pop is in chat and follows up the comment about Eat, Pray, Love, and 3D, saying

974
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,600
Julia Roberts' mouth in 3D would be a sin of technology.

975
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,480
Ah, see, 3D bad.

976
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,680
There's this picture I sometimes see on Oh No They Didn't, and somebody needs to link

977
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,680
it in chat.

978
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,080
I'm like, Alan, find this picture.

979
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,720
It's like, it's a picture of Julia Roberts, but it's been photoshopped to really exaggerate

980
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,080
her horse mouth.

981
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
And it's really scary.

982
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,200
Like, it makes her look like a zombie.

983
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,600
Surety has an exaggerated horse mouth.

984
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
I don't want to see the picture.

985
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
It's so scary.

986
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,600
No, don't do it, Alan.

987
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
No.

988
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,960
Somebody will find it for me.

989
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,040
SSJ100Matt says, Rob's still waiting for Showgirls 3D.

990
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
True story.

991
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
Oh my God.

992
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,960
Actually, you want to hear a true story?

993
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,240
I bought Showgirls on Blu-ray this week for $18.

994
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
It was on sale.

995
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Wow.

996
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
That's awesome.

997
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I want to go watch it.

998
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
We should have it.

999
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
I should come over.

1000
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
We should have a Showgirls party.

1001
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Let's do it.

1002
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
I want to watch the TV version.

1003
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
And we'll have brown rice and vegetables, Rob.

1004
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,680
We'll have a whole little Showgirls party.

1005
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,680
It'll be fun.

1006
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
Yay.

1007
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Ah.

1008
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,200
That is seriously a movie that needs to be in 3D, though.

1009
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
And...

1010
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Eat, Pray, Love.

1011
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
No, not Eat, Pray, Love.

1012
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Showgirls.

1013
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Well, actually, not even.

1014
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Showgirls.

1016
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
No one wants to see that movie.

1017
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,320
I want Saved by the Bell 3D, then.

1018
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,840
No, because they had, was it the Piranha 3D or whatever, and they had a whole bunch of

1019
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,360
like, oh, it's a wet t-shirt contest, you know, type of stuff.

1020
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,000
So we need more of that with less of the piranhas.

1021
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,280
I mean, the piranhas are cool and all, but I mean, you don't need to mix them both together.

1022
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Yeah.

1023
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,880
Like, Nomi's nipples are going to be coming out into your face.

1024
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,100
But can you imagine, you know, the really weird thrash sex she was doing?

1025
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,340
You know that in 3D?

1026
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,340
That'd be some scary stuff.

1027
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,480
That would be scary.

1028
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
People would be like, ah.

1029
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
What the fuck is that?

1030
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
You gonna die?

1031
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Watch.

1032
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I know what's happening in this movie.

1033
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
You gonna die.

1034
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Ah.

1035
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Rob, close it now.

1036
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,480
I hate it.

1037
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
Ah.

1038
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Ah.

1039
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Ah.

1040
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Times a million.

1041
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
No.

1042
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
I found the picture I was looking for.

1043
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Or one of them.

1044
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Oh, my God.

1045
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Hold on.

1046
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
This is terrible radio.

1047
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,960
Let me leave this nerd shack.

1048
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,240
What is going on?

1049
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,600
I don't know, but I lost the don't shit my pants game.

1050
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,480
Why is that like, Enzite guy there?

1051
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
No.

1052
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Okay.

1053
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
I just.

1054
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Cover it up.

1055
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Cover it up with that window.

1056
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
Move it, Rob.

1057
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Don't.

1058
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Ah.

1059
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Just Google.

1060
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Okay.

1061
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Or not Google.

1062
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
Go to photo bucket.

1063
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Because they let you search your pictures and search for Julia Roberts.

1064
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Gif.

1065
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
Gif.

1066
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
Julia Roberts.

1067
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Gif.

1068
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
And it will come right up.

1069
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
It's like the first image.

1070
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
It's hilarious.

1071
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Oh, my God.

1072
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
Let's see.

1073
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Um.

1074
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,320
Spazinator PSN says, I wouldn't mind seeing Angelina Jolie's boobs in 3D.

1075
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,840
Just saying.

1076
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,800
You know, wanted might have been kind of cool in 3D, because they tried to do some 3D ish

1077
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,800
kind of things in that.

1078
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,020
I could see that working.

1079
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,640
You know, with a movie like that, that's just like this movie is like so hetero.

1080
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
It's dick has a dick like type of thing.

1081
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Yeah.

1082
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,640
That's weird.

1083
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,640
That's not very hetero right there.

1084
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,240
I would not fuck a dick that had a dick.

1085
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
That would be awkward.

1086
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,440
Yeah, I'm like, I gotta go now away from your dick.

1087
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,860
You know what I mean, though?

1088
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
I guess.

1089
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,320
That would be weird if, like, the bullets went around your face in 3D.

1090
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,720
I almost got shot.

1091
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,240
Yeah.

1092
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
You know what I'm going to do?

1093
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,760
I'm going to post that Julia Roberts gift to our Twitter and just see what we're past.

1094
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,160
I'm going to see who's not listening to the show right now by seeing the responses we

1095
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
get.

1096
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
Okay.

1097
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,120
And in the meantime, did it work that at that?

1098
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:33,120
So, back to the Doctor and the Princess Show.

1099
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:39,120
Well, now that we're done with that topic, let's talk about Halo Reach and its shortcomings.

1100
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,960
Halo Reach is an awesome game, but somebody didn't test it well enough, and that somebody

1101
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:50,000
would be Microsoft, because Halo Reach has problems playing on the brand new 4GB Xbox

1102
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
360 slimmer system.

1103
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,760
It's funny, because apparently co-op requires a hard drive in order to work, which is dumb

1104
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,120
to begin with.

1105
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:08,000
The 4GB of storage that's on those new systems is kind of classified as a memory unit.

1106
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,880
So therefore, despite the fact that you have adequate space to store whatever files they

1107
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,080
want you to store, it still won't let you play co-op.

1108
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,460
And same with USB memory sticks.

1109
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,600
Those also don't count.

1110
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,000
Those are still thumb drives or memory sticks or whatever.

1111
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,040
That's not a hard drive.

1112
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,040
Not close enough.

1113
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,680
So you're still going to have to play solo or play online.

1114
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,400
You have to play with yourself.

1115
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,480
Apparently though, Microsoft has said that they're aware of the issue, and this is going

1116
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,560
to be a temporary issue.

1117
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,720
The company is working to resolve it.

1118
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
But seriously, come on, man.

1119
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,920
That should have been something that you should have tested first.

1120
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,040
Let's try playing this on each of our SKUs, especially the ones that have just come out,

1121
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,440
and let's see if it works correctly.

1122
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,520
On one of the biggest games for our company, that might be important to do.

1123
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Just a little bit.

1124
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:08,200
Or maybe they're just trying to upsell those bigger console bundles.

1125
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,160
Let me buy your stupid 4GB system and then I have to buy your really expensive hard drive

1126
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,900
to plug into it because normal hard drives won't work, despite the fact that it's a normal

1127
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,960
hard drive, but formatted differently.

1128
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Fun.

1129
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
Totally.

1130
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,640
Why can't you just allow anybody to put their own hard drives in there?

1131
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
Just like Sony.

1132
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,400
At least they have that going for them.

1133
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,520
Alright well I'm going to move on to another story here about a website called Good Old

1134
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,080
Games and a lot of interesting developments that's going on today.

1135
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,960
After hearing about the developments I kind of hesitate even bringing up this story on

1136
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,960
the show in the first place, but it's kind of bold what's going on.

1137
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,880
Well Good Old Games is a website located at GOG.com and we brought them up on the show

1138
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,880
before.

1139
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,280
It's a website where you can buy old games like the King's Quest series and just like

1140
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:10,480
old PC games from back in the day for like 5 bucks or 10 bucks and it's all DRM free.

1141
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,620
Like Fallout 2, just older PC games.

1142
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,480
So it's kind of like legalized abandonware basically.

1143
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,640
For companies that still want to sell their old games.

1144
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,320
Well they shut down today and posted a notice on their website that says, we recently had

1145
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,540
to give serious thought as to whether we could really keep GOG.com going the way it is.

1146
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,380
We've debated on it for quite some time and unfortunately we've decided that GOG.com simply

1147
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,800
cannot remain in its current form.

1148
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:39,440
So the website, a lot of news sites kind of post about this, oh this is such a good idea,

1149
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,000
made this thing legal and you know it was good karma to buy the games and stuff and

1150
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
now they've shut down.

1151
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,080
Oh it's a bummer to see them go.

1152
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:53,880
But now it's coming out today, did they really shut down or is this all a marketing ploy?

1153
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,360
And that is apparently the latest news that is coming out is that this is actually a marketing

1154
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:06,240
ploy about their change from the beta version of GOG.com to the full version of GOG.com.

1155
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,560
And in an article that Kotaku ran, they actually got an update from spokesman Tom Ohle, O-H-L-E,

1156
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
Ohle?

1157
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Ohle?

1158
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,560
Well he's kind of an a-hole if this whole thing turns out to be true, saying quote,

1159
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,520
as the message on the site says, this doesn't mean that GOG is gone, we'll have more to

1160
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,160
share in the coming days.

1161
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,240
It's kind of bootsy, I don't like that.

1162
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,580
It's just, here's the thing, and I even commented this on my Twitter when this whole thing was

1163
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,920
going on, it was like, you know, more people are talking about GOG.com today than they

1164
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,440
probably ever did during its run, and it's kind of one of those, well you know they had

1165
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,760
a good idea, but if they weren't really selling the games, how are they going to really stay

1166
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
in business?

1167
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,320
You know it's kind of a bummer that people decided to start carrying today.

1168
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,800
Well what's interesting is that now the whole thing might have actually been a media hoax.

1169
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,280
So on one hand you got to kind of go, lol, that's funny, good job, you got the press.

1170
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,280
But on the other hand, to your loyal customers who are kind of freaking out about, are the

1171
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,840
games I bought still going to work, how am I going to re-download these games, you know

1172
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,840
your core fan base is going to feel a little bit used after something like this.

1173
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,480
So it's like, yes you get the exposure, but at what cost?

1174
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,680
I felt very used on Rob's network.

1175
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,800
Have you ever bought a game on GOG?

1176
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,720
I didn't think so.

1177
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:28,040
Yeah, Spassinator PSN in our chat room says, good ol' games, bad ol' decisions.

1178
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,120
That could be accurate.

1179
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
You alright?

1180
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
Yes!

1181
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
Nothing happened at all.

1182
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Yes, we're good over here.

1183
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Good, good to hear it.

1184
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,120
The core definitely didn't fall out of the microphone.

1185
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,120
Nope, nope, it stayed intact.

1186
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,120
Wow.

1187
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,960
Loki, what do you think?

1188
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,400
I know you probably weren't a big advocate of this site in the first place, but what

1189
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,200
do you think about this as a marketing trick?

1190
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,880
As a marketing trick?

1191
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,840
That's cool that we're all talking about you, and then when you come back you're like,

1192
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,600
ah, no, we're not really going away, everyone's like, okay, no, we're not talking about you

1193
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,840
anymore, no one cares.

1194
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,320
I think it's, in terms of marketing, because keep in mind there is no such thing as bad

1195
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,280
press really, it gets people talking.

1196
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,760
Here's my suggestion, and I know there's a handful of sites out there that listen to

1197
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,760
our show, for inspiration I'm sure, not to trash us on their blog every week, but here's

1198
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,080
the thing, if you cover the story about them shutting down, and you want to really get

1199
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,100
revenge on these guys and their little marketing tricks, and how they're using you basically

1200
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,760
to get free advertising for their site, cover the story about them shutting down, and don't

1201
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,120
cover the story about them reopening.

1202
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,960
And then punch them in the dick, and the guy will be like, ole, my dick.

1203
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,760
If you want.

1204
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,280
But no, seriously, because if nobody covers the story about them reopening.

1205
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,680
Then this little marketing thing kind of bit them in the ass, didn't it?

1206
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,280
Food for thought.

1207
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,640
I know if I ran a website such as the aforementioned Kotaku or Joystiq, I just wouldn't run, I

1208
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:08,360
would say, you know, I'm not your little press release releasing bitch, so I'm not writing

1209
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,620
the story about you guys reopening or launching the new site.

1210
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,760
Good luck getting the press on that one.

1211
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,760
P.S.

1212
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,040
You suck.

1213
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,760
And some quotes in our chat room, MXT says GOG has died, SEG says GOG had jumped the

1214
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,520
shark, and Spazinator says more like fuck the shark.

1215
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,800
I'm actually not sure exactly how one fucks the shark as opposed to jumping over it.

1216
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,480
It's like, aye, aye.

1217
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,640
Wow, Rob.

1218
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,880
Bend over, shark.

1219
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,840
That doesn't show your age.

1220
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,000
Dark Sakura, please, won't you help us change the subject?

1221
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,080
There are other subjects, definitely.

1222
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:48,480
It was spoken, actually, it came up on Twitter.

1223
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,480
Katsuhiro Harada, who is the Tekken director guy, he posted on Twitter, TGS September 18th

1224
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:03,000
at Togeki booth, I'll announce something, colon D. Smile face.

1225
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,200
And we actually don't know what it is yet.

1226
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,880
It's Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

1227
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,240
Sorry.

1228
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,840
Yeah.

1229
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,720
Are you not excited about Tekken Tag Tournament 2?

1230
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,120
I wasn't excited about the first Tekken Tag Tournament.

1231
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,400
No, I think that's what it ended up being, yeah, he's right.

1232
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,800
You know I still have to play it, because it's Tekken.

1233
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
Sorry.

1234
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,960
Well, I mean, wasn't there like, in the 3D Street Fighter series, didn't you like, not

1235
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,160
like the first game but the second one was okay?

1236
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Things like that?

1237
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
In the EX ones?

1238
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Yeah.

1239
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,320
They're alright, I'm just not a big fan of the Tekken Tag series, I mean, did they make

1240
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,640
it better than the first one?

1241
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,400
Whoa, your mic cut out, sorry, I didn't even realize we just had big dead air, sorry about

1242
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
that.

1243
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
LAH!

1244
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Okay.

1245
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
So Tekken Tag.

1246
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Tekken Tag, if it's better than the first one, then yeah, I won't be disappointed, but

1247
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,440
I don't know, the first one was really not all that great, except for Tekken Bowl.

1248
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,480
Well, here's my thoughts on it, that it's probably just gonna be, since they're developing

1249
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:12,160
a tag team tournament, you know, sort of engine for, you know, Tekken X Capcom, you know,

1250
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,660
the Namco version of that, it'll probably just be based off that, except it's not gonna

1251
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,200
have any Capcom characters in it.

1252
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,360
Which, if you ask me, is kind of lame, because, you know, when you play Tekken X Capcom, you're

1253
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,000
just, you're gonna want to play that game versus, you know, the other one anyways, so.

1254
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's sort of like, what's the point?

1255
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Uh, yeah.

1256
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It is.

1257
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And apparently, that game will be hitting Japanese arcades in 2011, and it is an updated,

1258
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,960
I guess, it is a follow-up, of course, to 1999's arcade original, updated with new roster,

1259
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,360
and current gen graphics engine, doesn't say that the US version has been announced yet,

1260
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,400
but they have a nice little teaser trailer that's up right now.

1261
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,040
Well, you know they're gonna have a US version.

1262
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,600
Well, I mean, if this is an arcade game, that's kind of good news, I guess.

1263
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,400
We've had some, a few stories in the past few weeks about good news for arcade games,

1264
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,400
you know?

1265
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,040
Like, they're getting some things that the consoles actually don't have just yet, although,

1266
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,480
it's probably inevitable this comes out for consoles as well, but.

1267
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,960
Well, I hope it does, but I would really like to see, um, if it did get an arcade release

1268
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,600
in the US, you know I'd play it.

1269
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,980
Like I said, I don't think if it does come out console, or if it does come out, uh, yeah,

1270
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,600
console-wise, it's not gonna take that long to port it over, because, like I said, they're

1271
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:38,920
building an engine already for, uh, the, you know, Tekken Cross Capcom game, so, uh, or

1272
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,320
Street Fighter, I guess.

1273
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,080
It's, it's gonna be the same damn engine, I know it.

1274
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,920
SSG-100 Matt in our chatroom says it actually looks like the same system as Tekken Cross

1275
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
Capcom, so.

1276
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,920
Yeah, and that, see, that's the sad thing, though, is since, you know, they have that

1277
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,500
game coming out, it's like, uh, you know, I could play that game, but I'd rather play

1278
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,120
the Capcom one, or the, not the Capcom, the Street Fighter one, because it's got, you

1279
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,560
know, more variety of characters, you know, and now you have this one.

1280
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,080
I just hope they don't put it, bring it out in console, just leave it in the arcade or

1281
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
something.

1282
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,520
But put all the characters, though, in, you know, the Street Fighter one, too, so that'd

1283
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
be kinda cool.

1284
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,240
Alright, let's travel around the world and talk about some games that are coming out

1285
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,600
a whole lot sooner than Tekken Tag Tournament.

1286
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,960
Uh, this week, not a whole lot coming out in the US, uh, it's actually pretty light,

1287
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,480
but next week it'll be pretty nice.

1288
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,800
Um, starting off, though, this week we have Swords on the Wii, it is a sword fighting

1289
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
game.

1290
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,560
Uh, looks like a re-release of a game called Chicken Blaster, with a stupid shotgun with

1291
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,560
that.

1292
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,560
Fun.

1293
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,560
Uh.

1294
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1295
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,840
Is it a chicken fighting game?

1296
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,440
One more time, please.

1297
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,800
Chicken Blaster on the Wii, and it comes with a shotgun?

1298
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,240
Yeah, a little shotgun attachment.

1299
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,240
Yeah.

1300
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,240
Okay, okay.

1301
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,480
It's a really small shotgun, I, I know, I know, oh, okay.

1302
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,520
The doctor dare says that Wii gaming is dead.

1303
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,520
How could you?

1304
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,520
You're wrong, sir.

1305
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
How could you?

1306
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
You are wrong.

1307
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
You just need Chicken Shooter.

1308
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,520
Chicken Blaster, okay.

1309
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,520
Chicken Shoot was the first game.

1310
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Chicken Blaster with your small shotgun.

1311
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,520
Get it right.

1312
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,240
Um, Sid Meier's Civilization V coming out on PC.

1313
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,240
Yay.

1314
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:22,440
Uh, new carnival games on the DS and the Wii, uh, yay, um, looks like, what is it, um, World

1315
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:35,080
Golf 2011, that's also on PC, um, Patrician, I think that's, Patrician IV on PC, I have

1316
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,980
no idea what the hell that is, uh, Formula One 2010, coming from, well, what was formerly

1317
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,560
Codemasters, now Warner Home Video Games, that's on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this

1318
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:52,160
week, uh, let's see.

1319
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,720
Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue on the DS, a tie-in with the new one coming out.

1320
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Yay.

1321
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,720
Whoopty shit.

1322
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,720
Uh.

1323
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,520
Come on, OLR listeners, how many of you bought Fancy Nancy last week, that's what I want

1324
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
to know.

1325
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Chirp, chirp.

1326
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:10,680
Ah, Sony, once again, not quite getting it, but High Velocity Bowling for Playstation 3.

1327
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,420
High Velocity Bowling, yes, you may remember this as the Playstation Network title that

1328
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,760
came out originally at $10, probably now $5, but hey, guess what, you're gonna pay $40

1329
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,760
for this one now.

1330
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,760
This one has move support, right?

1331
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,800
It does have move support, but I think the old one was getting patched for move support,

1332
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
I think.

1333
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,680
I could be wrong, but, uh, that would be ironic if that was the case.

1334
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:38,320
Um, Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allen Poe conspiracy, for the DS.

1335
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,320
What?

1336
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
Farm Frenzy?

1337
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,560
You know what, I was about to make the same joke I know I made on this show, like, four

1338
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,160
weeks ago, so this game had to have gotten pushed back, because I was gonna say, I will

1339
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,680
buy that game, quote the raven, nevermore.

1340
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,680
No!

1341
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,640
I know I made that joke four weeks ago, and you all groaned then, too.

1342
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,640
I'm leaving.

1343
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:00,800
Uh, Farm Frenzy Animal Country, yay, ah, that's for the DS.

1344
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:08,320
Club Penguin Game Day for the Wii, um, Gormiti the Lords of Nature, thank you, Konami, for

1345
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:13,160
this wonderful game on the DS and the Wii, and I'm being sarcastic, it's not wonderful

1346
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,080
at all, uh, Jewels of the Tropical Lost Island.

1347
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,920
God, this game list is shitty as fuck, man.

1348
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,160
This is the great thing, is that, low-key, like, whenever we do the US release dates,

1349
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,520
it'll be like, yeah, you know, Halo's coming out this week, and then we have on the DS,

1350
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:34,360
Fancy Nancy, and, uh, looks like we've got Jewel Questathon, and Chicken Shoot's coming

1351
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,360
out on the Wii!

1352
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,040
No, but that's my point, though, I've been waiting for, like, two years for, like, good

1353
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,080
games to start coming out on the Wii again, and I'm like, okay, Zelda's coming out next

1354
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
year.

1355
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,640
You know what, you can come over and play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom with me.

1356
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,680
That's not, well, that's on the Wii, yeah, I played that.

1357
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,680
That's a fun game.

1358
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,680
That's about epic yarn.

1359
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,240
Well, that's not out yet, see, that's what I mean, that's not out yet, and that looks

1360
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,800
like a good game, shut up, that does not sound like Fancy Nancy.

1361
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,520
But before that, Wii Party.

1362
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:05,040
Did you see that they actually got the idea for the Kirby game from an old Kirby commercial

1363
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,800
that Nintendo had made using yarn?

1364
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,520
There is some decent stuff coming out this week, and we're also going to end with some

1365
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:17,520
crappy stuff, um, as if we haven't already, um, was it, uh, Etrian Odyssey 3, the Drowned

1366
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:23,160
City on DS, that's a pretty good RPG from, um, Atlus.

1367
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,800
Final Fantasy XIV, the collector's edition, coming out on PC this week.

1368
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,520
I think you get that earlier than the regular version, I guess that's special.

1369
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,280
Wait, and how much, how much are you going to pay for Final Fantasy XIV to play it early?

1370
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,280
Seventy-five dollars.

1371
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,280
Good lord, that's a lot of money.

1372
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:52,120
Also, uh, also this week, Darksiders, uh, on PC, and, um, and I believe that's it.

1373
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:57,000
Alright, uh, before we go to Japan, let's go to the, and their release dates, let's

1374
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,720
go to, uh, some of the comments in our chatroom at chat.orangeslauncerated.com, um, Spazinator

1375
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,240
PSN says, wait, wait, wait, did Sky just say chicken shitter?

1376
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,240
What the fuck?

1377
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,320
Actually, that game would probably be a whole lot more interesting, um, yeah, chicken shitter.

1378
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,440
Mark Toagak says, Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club.

1379
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,300
Can I take a tangent for a minute?

1380
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:20,080
Tangent train, absolutely, 100%, has nothing to do with video games whatsoever, but it

1381
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,440
does have to do with strippers.

1382
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,440
Okay, yes, you can.

1383
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,820
So, I went out clubbing last night with Alan and we met, you know, some mutual friends

1384
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:33,240
and met up for dinner and went to one of the bars downtown and we were sitting at a bar,

1385
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:38,000
a table that is right by the window, so you can look out onto the street and see what's

1386
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
going on.

1387
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,520
And we watched this, there's a really popular gay bar across the street where all the little

1388
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,980
like circuit boys and all their little, you know, the women that want to go see the horny

1389
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,980
guys and stuff.

1390
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,560
That's, that's the club they all go to that I outgrew many, many, many years ago.

1391
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,560
I know what you're talking about.

1392
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,560
Yes.

1393
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,560
You know exactly which place I'm talking about.

1394
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,240
Anyone who lives in Sacramento knows what club I'm talking about.

1395
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,860
So we are sitting at the place across the street looking out the window and we see this

1396
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:12,440
gigantic bus pull up in front of it and inside the bus is like all these disco lights and

1397
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,520
like green neon lights going on and we look carefully in the bus.

1398
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,360
There's a stripper pole inside the bus.

1399
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,360
That's awesome.

1400
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,040
And I'm like, what in the hell is that?

1401
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,080
And my friend speaks up and I don't remember if it was Alan or my friend says, oh, it's

1402
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,280
one of those stripper buses.

1403
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,340
I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1404
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,340
They have that now?

1405
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:37,560
They have traveling, like put on your seatbelt, strap herself to the pole.

1406
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
How does that rock?

1407
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
What?

1408
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,560
It's not a stripper bus.

1409
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,560
It's a limo bus.

1410
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:48,800
And the reason we, this is funny, uh, we last week, um, we did our game summit thing and

1411
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,920
we, one of the days we went out, uh, they took us to a few wineries and they did wine

1412
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,920
tasting.

1413
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,240
Well, they had two different limo buses, they had a shorter one and then they had a larger

1414
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,240
one.

1415
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,160
And the other one had a stripper pole in the back.

1416
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,600
So it's just, it's just a bus, but I mean, hold on, hold on.

1417
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,640
We need, if we're going to talk about party bus, we need party bus music.

1418
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,640
Brilliant.

1419
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
I approve.

1420
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,820
So yeah, so they do have a stripper pole in the back and I suppose if you were to rent

1421
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:22,680
it, say for a bachelor party or something, you could have strippers performing.

1422
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:28,880
Now granted, it might not be the safest thing for them to be doing, but, uh, sure, why not?

1423
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:35,800
So finally the lights go on in this bus and there's like, I shit you not, like 50 drunk

1424
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,400
chicks all piled in this bus and like, it's like, it's like the lights went onto the club

1425
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,720
at 2am and they all just start pouring out the front of the bus and go on into a little

1426
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,280
gay club.

1427
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,920
And that's why I stopped going to that club also, Rob, because every Friday and Saturday

1428
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,920
night it's like, let's let all the straights in.

1429
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,320
And there was like two gay people there and I was like, what is going on?

1430
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:10,360
I haven't been there in like six years now.

1431
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,720
I'm sorry, but I would just, I was just fascinated.

1432
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,200
Like what if that bus, I mean that bus was a big bus and it was taking up an entire lane

1433
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,560
and surely it doesn't turn well.

1434
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,560
And I'm just thinking like, what if that bus gets in an accident?

1435
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:28,720
You're going to have just drunk chicks pouring out the windshield.

1436
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,640
They won't know because they're drunk.

1437
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,760
So it doesn't matter.

1438
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,560
That is a, that is a terrible thing.

1439
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,680
Having a bunch of drunk chicks inside of a bus with the stripper pole, geez, that would

1440
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,680
suck.

1441
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,000
Well, and then all the skanky slutty twink boys that you were nice enough to call the

1442
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,520
circuit boys, all the skanky slutty snotty twink boys that are faces won't even know

1443
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,400
because they'll just be like, whatever.

1444
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,640
I like how I went out of my way to not give the clubs names and then you're just like,

1445
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,240
uh, Oh, this is interesting.

1446
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,240
Okay.

1447
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,520
Tiger call linked us a picture here in chat of a stripper bus.

1448
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,160
This must be in Nevada.

1449
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,160
It's one of the advertisement.

1450
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,160
Yeah.

1451
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,160
Yeah.

1452
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,600
That's, it was close to that though.

1453
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,760
It was close to that, but it looked a little bit more like a regular stripper bus that

1454
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,440
looks like a billboard, a regular stripper bus or a regular bus making distinctions between

1455
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,440
types of buses.

1456
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,440
Anyhow, interesting.

1457
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,720
Okay.

1458
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,520
We should go to Japanese release date stripper pole.

1459
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,240
That's just a pole so that you don't fall over.

1460
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,520
You hold onto it, you know, in lieu of a seatbelt, you know, let's go to the Japanese release

1461
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,720
dates, but we're going to make them a little more interesting tonight.

1462
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,720
That's going to read them in Korean.

1463
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:50,080
Here come your Japanese release dates.

1464
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,600
Devil May Cry 4 gets a price reduction in Japan, September 22nd, Singularity makes its

1465
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:01,600
way out to the Xbox 360 in Japan at of course being the localized version of the Activision

1466
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,760
game that I believe came out here a little while ago, the party keeps on rolling onto

1467
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,160
the PlayStation three at some point.

1468
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,320
Hey, there's a lot of games coming out on the Xbox 360 PlayStation three gets Devil

1469
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,400
May Cry four price reduction there as well and Singularity as well as winning post seven

1470
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,400
2010.

1471
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,400
Good times.

1472
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Wow.

1473
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,400
I know.

1474
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,920
I have my pre-order on that right now.

1475
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:36,000
On the Nintendo Wii out in Japan this week, we have, it looks like nothing.

1476
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,840
What a surprise on the PlayStation two.

1477
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
Also nothing.

1478
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,120
How about on the Nintendo DS?

1479
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,880
There's a game called Jacka Jacka music comes out this week.

1480
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Whoa.

1481
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,840
Are you sure that's not jack Jacka Jacka music.

1482
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,200
I got your Jacka Jacka music right here.

1483
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,440
Excuse me.

1484
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,400
I'll be right back.

1485
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,160
What the hell is Jacka Jacka music?

1486
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,160
Tell me.

1487
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,280
I don't know, but I'm going to go Jacka Jacka all night long.

1488
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,880
I'm trying to look at the music or the, it looks like it's just showing you chords and

1489
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,640
this looks really boring.

1490
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,640
I think I'd fall asleep.

1491
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,640
I get it.

1492
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:33,080
If you Jacka Jacka before bed, you'll fall asleep easier.

1493
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:44,600
And then on the Sony PSP this week, do rah, rah, rah, I shit you not, that's the name

1494
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
of the game.

1495
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,080
Do rah, rah, rah, three way standoff.

1496
01:08:49,080 --> 01:09:06,040
Whoa, three way, wow, Rob's having a moment comes out this week and there's three way

1497
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,600
action here.

1498
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,020
It always is experimental.

1499
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,360
There's other PSP games coming out, but I'm done.

1500
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,000
They're not doing rah, rah, rah.

1501
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,520
No, you're not done.

1502
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,780
I closed it.

1503
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:19,780
That's okay.

1504
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:23,320
Cause I have a good name for you, Rob, for something that comes in on the 22nd death

1505
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:28,800
spank thongs of virtue for our UK releases.

1506
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,840
The chatters are pointing out do rah, rah, rah as an anime.

1507
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,840
Yes.

1508
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:41,560
So about three way sex amongst school children on the 24th we have blue dragon awakened shadow

1509
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:49,560
on the DS dark siders for PC dead rising to guitar hero warriors of rock, um, lost horizon

1510
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,560
quantum theory.

1511
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:56,000
I just liked that name, quantum theory, Sid Meyer, civilization five for PC and test drive

1512
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:06,520
unlimited two and track mania two all for PC, Ooh, Navy seals.

1513
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,520
All right.

1514
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,920
Are we ready to get back into some gaming news?

1515
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
Why not?

1516
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
Yes.

1517
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,680
This is coming from the show because again, because, um, Alan said I have to play this

1518
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,400
link on air cause it has to do with the stripper bus.

1519
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,400
Okay.

1520
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,800
So this is a video from the onion.com.

1521
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,120
Oh God, I only know where this is going to go again.

1522
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,440
This is coming from the onion.com.

1523
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,200
Uh, let me, let me stop you real quick because you did miss once and she didn't want to talk

1524
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,200
about it.

1525
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,200
What I missed stuff.

1526
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,720
Um, there is a Ryoga, uh, gotoku, uh, shin show.

1527
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,960
Um, it's, it's the, uh, Oh, great.

1528
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,840
And now I can't remember the damn title.

1529
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,840
Uh, the Yakuza on the PSP came out this week as well.

1530
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,840
That's a little bit of a big title for Japan.

1531
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,200
Can I talk about the stripper bus again?

1532
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,040
Talk about the stripper bus.

1533
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,280
If you're just joining us, we are covering a developing story.

1534
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:07,240
We go back now to Southern California where a VH1 bus crashed just a short while ago,

1535
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,800
revealing more than 2000 pounds of slot on the interstate five-year Palmdale.

1536
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,240
The bus was transporting contestants for the new VH1 reality series, the road to Knoxville

1537
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,880
in which 18 scantily clad young women vie for the heart of divorce stuntman Johnny Knoxville

1538
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,640
officials there are struggling to control the spread of slot, which has already polluted

1539
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,360
the roadway and is spreading now down a Hillside into residential areas.

1540
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,120
Let's go live to onion news networks.

1541
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,720
Brian Scott, who's live on the scene, Brian, what's exactly going on out there?

1542
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,720
Well, it's just horrible.

1543
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:40,160
Anna, the highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of

1544
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,680
this orange skinned slot.

1545
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,960
I've only been here an hour.

1546
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,440
I've already seen four three way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings and downwind

1547
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,240
the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.

1548
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,400
It sounds like quite a scene.

1549
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,320
Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington beach early

1550
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,320
this morning.

1551
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Is that right?

1552
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
That's where it began.

1553
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,320
Yes.

1554
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,560
The sluts were being transported from a negligee wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl

1555
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,280
on girl paintball match when the crash occurred.

1556
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,280
There's speculation.

1557
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,280
In fact, the accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on

1558
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,160
the vehicle and getting on the drive and see now the local fire department is just not

1559
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,280
equipped to handle something this toxic.

1560
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,640
The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel river and officials are concerned

1561
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,640
that the sluts might go skinny dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in

1562
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,640
it.

1563
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,640
We should say to the crews, they're doing their best.

1564
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,480
They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip offs and shooter contests

1565
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,480
in the ditch.

1566
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
Finally.

1567
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,360
Now we've just gotten word that VH1 issued a statement.

1568
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,440
It's on their website.

1569
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,280
It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts, but the EPA has urged VH1

1570
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,600
to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly concentrated slut they use

1571
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,600
now.

1572
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,600
Yeah.

1573
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,280
Sounds, uh, sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1 is gonna ever go for that.

1574
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,720
Brian, stay safe out there and don't fuck any of those sluts.

1575
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,720
All right, thanks.

1576
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,720
Moving on.

1577
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:01,040
A new Apple laptop become preloaded with a half written coming of age knob.

1578
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,480
I fucking love the onion.

1579
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,480
Did you see the one they did about, you have to understand that was what we saw last night.

1580
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,240
No, I just right here in Sacramento.

1581
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,240
Okay.

1582
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,240
Rob, we get it.

1583
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,240
Just say it.

1584
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,240
Okay.

1585
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,240
I love the onion too.

1586
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,240
Me too.

1587
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,840
Do you see the one about the impending, uh, a flood from Folsom dam and then creating

1588
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:26,520
the Memorial for it and talking to the first person who dies in the flood.

1589
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,000
Actually, you know what's funny, Matt and I, the, the old apartment we lived at, I mean,

1590
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,080
we can say this now cause we don't live there anymore.

1591
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,200
We used to live in an apartment, the old studio.

1592
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:40,800
This was the studio from about episodes, what about 50 to probably like 150 were taped at

1593
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
the apartment.

1594
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,140
We're looking, I used to live together, which was right next to Folsom dam.

1595
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,160
We live in this little apartment complex was literally right next to it.

1596
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,760
And you know, if that dam ever broke, we'd be looking down on all the people getting

1597
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,160
flooded out cause we were on top of the Hill.

1598
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,160
Ah, good one.

1599
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,160
Rob.

1600
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,840
You're so you have so much concern for other people.

1601
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,840
Hey, video games.

1602
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,840
Yeah.

1603
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,840
Loki.

1604
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
Yes.

1605
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,840
Help.

1606
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,840
Let's talk about games.

1607
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:14,200
Um, Nielsen, uh, the wonderful agency that talks about, you know, different ads and you

1608
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,840
know, entertainment trends.

1609
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,680
Uh, they did a study of the six EA sports titles, um, including NHL 10 and be a live

1610
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:31,040
or nine, um, that had in game ad advertisements in them and a guess, um, apparently they increased

1611
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,280
household dollars, um, spent on, um, different things by 24%.

1612
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,940
Uh, one of them that they looked at was Gatorade and that was, uh, I guess the case there.

1613
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,940
It's interesting.

1614
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,600
I don't, I don't know.

1615
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,760
I don't buy that people, you know, they see Gatorade on a billboard in the background

1616
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,560
that they're going to really go and buy Gatorade.

1617
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:59,320
I think a lot of players that play sports games for a long period of time, maybe perhaps

1618
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:04,640
like drinking, you know, Gatorade or soda or whatever, and it's just a coincidence if

1619
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,640
you ask me.

1620
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:12,160
But, um, apparently they have a press release out and, uh, summarizing the different things,

1621
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:18,280
um, including, I don't know, like if they cover Axe body spray or something like that.

1622
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,280
That'd be interesting.

1623
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,200
Actually, um, Nielsen's been running, um, studies on our show here at orange lounge

1624
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:28,360
radio and it's showing that, um, after tonight's episode, it looks like, uh, we had an increase

1625
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,360
33% of our listeners decided to go to six flags after tonight's show.

1626
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,360
It's something else.

1627
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,480
All right, I'll stop.

1628
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,280
All right.

1629
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:47,680
But yeah, they said the out of, um, I guess the, the panel of, uh, 100,000 households,

1630
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:53,240
uh, representing the U S population according to the, I guess their home scan panel or whatever

1631
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:57,680
says scanned, uh, video game, uh, UPC barcodes.

1632
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,600
The scan barcodes were then matched to a reference library, more than 14,000 video games.

1633
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:08,160
Nielsen compared the households that purchased the least of one of the studied games before

1634
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,060
and after the Gatorade branding was integrated into the games.

1635
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:17,000
The test group, uh, with the households that didn't purchase one, um, one of the games,

1636
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,820
the control group, it says the test and control groups are projected out abroad, blah, blah.

1637
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:29,160
See here it says, um, well overall they noticed that there was a 24% increase in sales after

1638
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
that.

1639
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,340
So you know what you just did?

1640
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:36,120
You just opened the flood gates for them to like, you know, put in all sorts of ridiculous

1641
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,300
stuff and way to go Nielsen.

1642
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:44,320
And trust me, it's going to get ridiculous as we will get to in part B. Oh, good.

1643
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,320
Ridiculously cool though.

1644
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:51,560
I have to say, so, uh, and honestly, I think when we do talk about this, this is how you

1645
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,240
do the advertisement because it's fucking awesome.

1646
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,440
Now you got me all curious.

1647
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
All right.

1648
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,160
We're, we're going to be talking about Sega game.

1649
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Ooh, goodie.

1650
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
All right.

1651
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,760
Uh, moving on to a story about a lawsuit, but this is the end of a lawsuit.

1652
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,760
Hooray.

1653
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:14,480
As most of them usually end up finishing, it's the end of a 2008 lawsuit that never

1654
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,560
went to trial.

1655
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,560
Yes.

1656
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,280
That's how long these things take to settle.

1657
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
Who is in the lawsuit?

1658
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,480
It was Konami and harmonics.

1659
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,600
It was a lawsuit launched by Konami.

1660
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,640
Uh, there was a filing in a federal court in Texas this week and the two parties agreed

1661
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,780
to dismiss all came claims and counterclaims.

1662
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:36,440
It was a suit over harmonics is rock band infringing on patents that were owned by Konami

1663
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,960
because of course, Konami had guitar freaks many years ago, et cetera, et cetera.

1664
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,400
Rock bands, rock revolution.

1665
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,360
Well, remember they said rock revolution failed because the, the rock band two stuff.

1666
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:55,520
Well, among other things that was maybe like, like a little sliver, like half a percent

1667
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,360
of the reasons why anyhow.

1668
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,440
Uh, there was also a 2009 countersuit via com actually filed it on behalf of harmonics

1669
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,920
that was dropped in a federal court in Boston.

1670
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,720
So that means Konami and harmonics officially kissed and made up, but we will never know

1671
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,600
the details of it because the terms are sealed.

1672
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,600
Was there tongue?

1673
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,600
Perhaps.

1674
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,440
We will not know because it's sealed.

1675
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,040
A slut bus was involved.

1676
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:24,320
I'm told actually, and they were all playing dance masters and with a stripper pole strip

1677
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,320
masters.

1678
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:31,760
Anyhow, now's the part of the show where we're going to let dark Sakura take over and, uh,

1679
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:37,160
delve into the classic video game vault and, uh, choose a game for us that she thinks,

1680
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
you know what?

1681
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,680
You little brats, you should be playing this game.

1682
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:52,400
It's classic video game of the week, dark Sakura, which they'd be playing is super Mario

1683
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:59,680
brothers two, sweet, which, um, I actually have to think, um, Tara for suggesting super

1684
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,320
Mario brothers, but I wanted to do super Mario brothers too.

1685
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,320
I was actually surprised.

1686
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,400
You have never picked this before, but you haven't.

1687
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,400
Yeah.

1688
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,400
You've done three, but never two.

1689
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,200
Super Mario brothers two wasn't actually a super Mario brothers game originally.

1690
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:17,080
It was called Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic, which was also on the Famicom disc system and had

1691
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,720
an intro and an ending.

1692
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,680
But the intro music sounds very familiar.

1693
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,080
It's so cute.

1694
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:30,080
Oh no, the kids get sucked into a book.

1695
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,080
Little monkey boys running away.

1696
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,440
I don't know what the little monkey is about.

1697
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
He just is there.

1698
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,360
Oh no, we four people are randomly showing up in these children's bedroom.

1699
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,080
Let's jump into the book.

1700
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,600
Not creepy at all.

1701
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,600
No.

1702
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,480
Now let's flip the disc over because like I said, Famicom disc.

1703
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,480
So anyway.

1704
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,480
Um, what do you want to hear?

1705
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,480
Doki Doki Panic music?

1706
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,480
It's the same thing.

1707
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,480
Yeah, pretty much.

1708
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,960
Although it's funny, some of the sound effects are different and they did, uh, uh, other

1709
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,960
sprite swaps like these weird looking head things were there, but they turned them into

1710
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,280
mushrooms and yeah.

1711
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,720
And this one, um.

1712
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:11,120
So you pulled heads out of the grounds instead of like, you know, no different cause that'd

1713
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,120
be really cool.

1714
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,560
You pull the vegetables out of the ground instead of these masks are sitting there instead

1715
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,500
of the mushroom blocks.

1716
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:25,680
At any rate, um, the whole thought that Nintendo had was that the original Super Mario Brothers

1717
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:29,560
2 that came out in 1986 was too hard.

1718
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,320
Oh no, American players, which is stupid because Japanese RPGs are ridiculously easy to start

1719
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,320
off.

1720
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,040
Did you ever play Final Fantasy 7 in Japanese?

1721
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,040
Uh, not gonna.

1722
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,040
Freaking easy.

1723
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,040
No.

1724
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,040
It's like hit dead.

1725
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Hit dead.

1726
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,040
So easy.

1727
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,040
But it is very, very hard.

1728
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,040
The original Super Mario 2.

1729
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,040
Oh yeah.

1730
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,600
The Mario, when it came out as lost levels here on the, on the Super Nintendo cartridge,

1731
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,600
um, the All Stars or whatever, it was really hard.

1732
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,600
Yeah.

1733
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,880
Beat it eventually, but it was, it was a hard game.

1734
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:06,440
Well, um, so what they did is, um, they took, uh, Doki Doki Panic and they, uh, I guess

1735
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,360
resprided it with the main characters and changed a few things.

1736
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,880
Like, they, because I guess there was more capacity to do stuff on the cartridge, they,

1737
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,040
um, they actually just, uh, could put in some more graphical elements.

1738
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,240
And of course, one thing that you'll notice listening to the two, um, different tracks

1739
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,240
is because the sound processor is just a little bit different for the games on disc versus

1740
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,240
the games.

1741
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:33,280
Like, if you ever listen to Legend of Zelda on disc from the disc system, the music sounds

1742
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,280
different.

1743
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,680
I mean, it's the same music, but it's, it uses different instrumentation, but anyway.

1744
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:45,120
And different sound effects, um, like, uh, like the bird thing squawks differently and

1745
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,280
it doesn't have the bonus game, like that has a different looking bonus game.

1746
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:53,280
Um, anyway, uh, so they did this because it was gonna, you know, they thought it would

1747
01:21:53,280 --> 01:22:00,400
be more popular and that it would be, be, uh, you know, fun and easy and, and since

1748
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:07,040
then it actually came out in Japan in 1992 as Super Mario USA, um, which came out with

1749
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,040
Super Mario All-Stars.

1750
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,240
So, we each got something fun.

1751
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:17,400
Um, but so yeah, you walk around and you throw potions down, which in the, uh, original,

1752
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,720
in the Doki Doki Panic, it's, uh, magic lamps, because it has sort of this, I guess, of Arabian

1753
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:28,720
Nights kind of theme in all these other levels, but you get your power-ups by going into these

1754
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:37,480
little reverse universe things and in Super Mario, um, 2, the, of course, our US one,

1755
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:44,840
you can play as Mario, who is like the all-around average dude, or Luigi, who is, uh, I always

1756
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:50,000
called him crazy legs dude, because his legs spin, but he jumps higher than anybody else.

1757
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,440
And you can play Toad, who, by the way, is not useless, you play Toad when you need to

1758
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,400
dig a lot, because he digs faster, or when you're trying to get those extra power-ups.

1759
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,100
Who was a chick in Doki Doki Panic, right?

1760
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,080
The blue character was a girl, wasn't it?

1761
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,540
That was, but that wasn't Toad.

1762
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,540
That was Mario.

1763
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:08,840
Oh, my bad.

1764
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,320
Yeah, um, and then you've got Princess, who was the pink chick with the hair and pants

1765
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,580
in the Doki Doki Panic.

1766
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,880
But she can float, though.

1767
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,520
Yes, she can float.

1768
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,640
Um, but Toad can't jump for shit.

1769
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:26,640
Anyway, you get POW blocks, which blow up things, and they're really fun.

1770
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:31,640
And, um, it had a life meter, which was unique for Mario game, you know, instead of your

1771
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,640
different sizes.

1772
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:39,520
But it was really stupid, because, like, if you lose one of your little segments there,

1773
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,160
then, um, you have to kill, like, a certain number of enemies so that you can get a heart

1774
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:49,200
to come up, and then you, you know, whatever, you will refill it.

1775
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,520
Um, also, to get your star.

1776
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:58,160
And I have to thank the irate gamer for this analogy, because it was spot on.

1777
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:02,680
You have to get, like, five cherries, and then your star will show up for your invincibility,

1778
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,840
except it takes forever to get to where you are, unless you're at the very bottom of the

1779
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,040
screen.

1780
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,600
And the way he described it, you have time to take a shit before the star arrives, which

1781
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,600
he proceeded to do.

1782
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,480
And I have to thank him for demonstrating that.

1783
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,480
Wow.

1784
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,480
Yes.

1785
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:25,600
Um, anyway, you, if you, uh, pull up the little, uh, plants in the little reverse universe,

1786
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,680
then you get coins, which you can use for a bonus game, which is basically, like, slots.

1787
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:33,960
And there, there's a pattern to it, and I used to always be able to get the pattern

1788
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,320
where you'd always get them to match.

1789
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,320
But it's-

1790
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:41,040
It seemed like if you hit the button really fast, you could usually win it.

1791
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:47,280
It was, it was like, for me, it was like, you hit one, and then you hit the next two

1792
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,160
twice as fast.

1793
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:53,600
It's, it is, it was like a duh-duh-duh was my rhythm.

1794
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,800
And I always, and I always got it, so, I guess it depends.

1795
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,560
Um, of course, if you also hit the button, like, really right away, like, after you've

1796
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,200
gotten a cherry, then you'll always get a cherry on the next one, so.

1797
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,280
So I would have, like, 50 million lives by, by the time I was done.

1798
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:15,720
Um, you've also got little, uh, warp zones, where if you throw your little jar at the

1799
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,720
right spot, it goes down.

1800
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,200
Ooh, you got audio issues going on.

1801
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,880
Um, were the warp zones in Doki Doki Panic?

1802
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,360
Yes, they were.

1803
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,360
Interesting.

1804
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:29,240
In fact, if you watch the playthrough, um, cause I linked a playthrough for Doki Doki

1805
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,240
Panic.

1806
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,440
Which is all you need to see of Doki Doki Panic, really.

1807
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,680
It really wasn't the better game.

1808
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:36,560
Like, a lot of people are like, oh, you know, it was the original, duh-duh-duh, but they

1809
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,760
made improvements when they brought it over here.

1810
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah, well, keep in mind, they had more, if I'm right, they had more storage capacity.

1811
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,720
The only thing that we're missing is the dinky little intro, which you had to flip the disk

1812
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:51,040
anyway to start off with, and then flip to play the game, and then flip to go back, and

1813
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,960
flip and flip and flip, and whatever, got tired of flipping off.

1814
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:57,840
So, but yeah, all the, all the warps and everything were there, you just throw them where there's

1815
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,520
a particular jar, you go down the jar, boom, you're somewhere else.

1816
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,960
And I love this little trick for, what is it, 6-1?

1817
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,440
Yeah, if you hear the sound, like, going crazy in the background, it's cause they're doing

1818
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,720
this trick where they go under the quicksand, and then jump, jump through the wall type

1819
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,720
of thing.

1820
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,720
Yeah.

1821
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,160
It, that was, that was always one of my favorite tricks.

1822
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:20,360
And there's also one in the very last level, where if you climb up to one screen in the,

1823
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,200
in the final castle, and then you let yourself fall and then jump, you will actually can

1824
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,600
skip, like, a whole bunch of screens.

1825
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,960
Although for me, I was, like, playing everything through.

1826
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:40,480
So, yeah, uh, it was, uh, they actually were planning on, um, releasing, uh, Doki Doki

1827
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:46,080
Panic in the US at some point, but they actually just didn't.

1828
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:52,720
And so they, they, you know, one thing about this, though, is that the reason why it does

1829
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:57,840
kind of fit in musically, and with sound effects, is cause the, um, the soundtrack was composed

1830
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,840
by Koji Kondo.

1831
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,840
Oh, okay.

1832
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,840
So it's very interesting to me, like, how much this ended up kind of just becoming a

1833
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,320
part of the Mario mythos, if you will.

1834
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,280
Like, you know, later Mario games had some of these characters that first appeared in

1835
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,960
really Doki Doki Panic kind of crossed over into the Mario universe, especially like some

1836
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:21,220
of the, I want to say, like, uh, the second Yoshi game on Super Nintendo, like, a lot

1837
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,880
of those monsters kind of were from this game.

1838
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,480
Yeah, because it was so popular that they really just ended up incorporating it into

1839
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,880
the whole Mario branding, I guess.

1840
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:36,520
As much as you might want to think Nintendo was kind of rude for dumbing it down, it really

1841
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,520
worked for them.

1842
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,520
It did.

1843
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,520
On multiple levels, in this case.

1844
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,200
It was interesting to me, though, just real quick, sorry, I know you have more you want

1845
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,840
to say, but, um, it was really interesting to me how this game really fit into the very

1846
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,480
odd 8-bit sequels that were nothing like the originals, in many ways.

1847
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:56,280
You know, you had this, you had Castlevania II Simon's Quest, which was a huge departure

1848
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:00,120
from the original, Zelda II was a huge departure from the original, it was very interesting

1849
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:04,400
how a lot of games, you know, were so different back then.

1850
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,720
It was just how it was done, you know, I think it was more of a desire to innovate and keep

1851
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,280
people interested, but one thing that, you know, and I think that's what they finally

1852
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:17,720
end up realizing is that people usually like the original games for a reason, and kind

1853
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,160
of want to keep them around, although, I remember playing this game, I rented it when I was

1854
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:26,480
a kid, and was just like, see, that's where you can go over all the screens, and I was

1855
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,400
just sort of like, what the crap, Nintendo, what'd you do this to me for, what's this

1856
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:35,040
ostrich thing spitting eggs at me, and then I liked it.

1857
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:42,280
Um, so, at any rate, um, we, uh, later on, there were the re-releases, there were Super

1858
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:50,800
Mario All-Stars, which was really sweet, and then, um, there was, you remember the Satellaview,

1859
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:57,120
Mario was a, uh, Gaiden version that was, um, Super Mario All-Stars on Satellaview,

1860
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:03,120
and it, it was called BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge, and so it ran in weekly volumes

1861
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,120
like all the other Satellaview games.

1862
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:14,840
Um, then we got Super Mario Advance, which was, um, the Super Mario Brothers 2, which

1863
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:20,680
actually was a lot harder, but it had some innovations that kept the game fresh, I think,

1864
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,680
for a lot of people.

1865
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,480
I, I really liked it.

1866
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:30,560
And so it's, uh, Super Mario 2, or as the original was, because I, I think I'd have

1867
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:37,960
to lump the games together, is that it was, uh, Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

1868
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:44,480
And actually, since I'm talking about that too, um, they did a Mario-style poster based

1869
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,260
off of the original cover for Doki Doki Panic.

1870
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,480
And the characters that were in there, um, was-

1871
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,840
I just want to point out in the time you've been talking, someone beat Mario 2 here on

1872
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,840
YouTube.

1873
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,840
Yeah.

1874
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,840
That's pretty amazing.

1875
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,840
I gotta say, that's pretty amazing.

1876
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,840
And by the way, I was-

1877
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,840
You cut out again.

1878
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,840
You cut out again.

1879
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,840
You scared to us.

1880
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,840
That mic is, is getting dated.

1881
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,760
I, no, the mic is new, I need a new cord.

1882
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,760
Yeah.

1883
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,960
At any rate, um, Imogene was, um, the, one of the little Toad-looking characters.

1884
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,160
And then there was Mama, who was the one in the blue, that was Luigi.

1885
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:24,240
And then there was Lina, who was the pink princess harem girl.

1886
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:30,120
And uh, Papa, who, who became Toad.

1887
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:37,160
And he actually, um, I think became a, no, the, no, I'm wrong.

1888
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,160
Forget I said anything.

1889
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,160
Anyway.

1890
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,160
Okay.

1891
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:44,040
Um, oh, now here's the differences, um, different title screen.

1892
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:49,240
And then, um, the story takes place in the storybook instead of in the dream world.

1893
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:55,240
And um, you have a save feature, because it was on the disk system.

1894
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,840
You cannot run with the B button.

1895
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,620
There, like I said, different music changes, different graphical changes.

1896
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:07,160
And you need fewer hits to hit wart in Doki Doki Panic than in Super Mario 2.

1897
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,720
The waterfall is faster than in Super Mario 2.

1898
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:14,720
And of course different sound effects because of the, uh, the number of pins between the

1899
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:19,320
Famicom disk and the full-size NES cartridges.

1900
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,060
And there you go.

1901
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,220
So it's sort of a split one.

1902
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:28,400
We have, it's Yumikojo, Doki Doki Panic, and, um, Super Mario Bros. 2.

1903
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,600
All right.

1904
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,800
There it is, your classic game of the week, Mario 2, here in the US, or Doki Doki Panic

1905
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,000
overseas.

1906
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,100
Good pick.

1907
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,800
One that I'm sure a lot of people remember.

1908
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,800
All right.

1909
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,440
We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1910
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,440
We're going to be right back.

1911
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,360
There's plenty more to come tonight in part B of our show.

1912
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,920
We're actually going to get into some more of the news that's coming out of Tokyo Game

1913
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:49,920
Show.

1914
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,920
We didn't do a lot this segment.

1915
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,920
We've got plenty more to come.

1916
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:56,160
Of course, your calls and tweets and emails, of which I'm sure there's plenty.

1917
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,560
We're going to get to all those.

1918
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,320
And more Rice Princess and the Doctor.

1919
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,320
Yay.

1920
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,320
Maybe.

1921
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,320
If I don't kick them off the show.

1922
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,320
Yes, it's going to happen.

1923
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,320
All right.

1924
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,080
No, they'll be here to tell more poop jokes when we return.

1925
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:15,160
With more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1926
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,720
And welcome back, everybody, to the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, live here at

1927
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:24,080
All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock

1928
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:28,160
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

1929
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,920
Going back over to Dark Sakura for a minute here, because she was talking about something

1930
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,300
during break that I thought was fascinating.

1931
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,320
You mentioned you were telling Rice Princess about some documentary you've been watching

1932
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,320
lately.

1933
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,320
What is this?

1934
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,320
It's not a documentary.

1935
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,920
I'm watching a Japanese drama from 2006 called Gal Circle.

1936
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:48,880
That's about these, like, these girls that, you know, are homeless and live in Shinjuku.

1937
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,920
They quit school to go be Para Para dancers.

1938
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,840
And they hang out in this warehouse and, you know, leech free food wherever they can find

1939
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,840
it.

1940
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:02,280
And it's a, it's a cute show, but like one of the characters is, um.

1941
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,280
What the hell?

1942
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:08,520
I'm listening to something, coming from the living room, that's like, Dan's watching the

1943
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,760
Angry Nintendo Nerd.

1944
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,200
Oh God.

1945
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:17,080
Anyway, um, so, but like the whole thing starts off with these, uh, US troops dropping somebody

1946
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,240
on, on, uh, Shinjuku.

1947
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:22,120
And it's this guy dressed up as a cowboy named Shinosuke.

1948
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,220
Cause you know, all Americans are cowboys.

1949
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,320
From Arizona.

1950
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:32,720
And he lives the Indian lifestyle and he's good friends with Geronimo, who is this Japanese

1951
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,720
guy in Arizona dressed up like an Indian.

1952
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,360
And he actually looks the part.

1953
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,760
Sounds amazingly racist, I love it.

1954
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,760
And this little girl named Momo, who, they're all like speaking random English.

1955
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,760
It's hilarious.

1956
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,760
So it's not a documentary.

1957
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,800
It's just, it's just a dramedy.

1958
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,800
It's a dorama.

1959
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,680
Oh, okay.

1960
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:58,640
And but it's like this guy completely knows nothing of Japanese life and he's teaching

1961
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,180
the girls these lessons through his innocence and.

1962
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:04,560
And they teach him the magic of dance.

1963
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,760
I'm on, I'm on the fourth episode now out of 11 and it's, uh, it's pretty funny.

1964
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,040
I don't know how I miss this.

1965
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,040
Yeah, I think I'll watch more Hoarders.

1966
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:18,040
All right, Rob, teach me the magic of dance.

1967
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,040
Excuse me.

1968
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,040
Sorry.

1969
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,040
Not time for Twitter topics yet.

1970
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,040
Be quiet.

1971
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,040
All right.

1972
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,040
Hey.

1973
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,040
I was listening.

1974
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,520
I was at the club the other night and I actually heard a song and the lyrics were, and the

1975
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:33,840
song is called commander and the lyrics were tonight I'll be your commander and I command

1976
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,400
you to dance.

1977
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,400
That's where that came from.

1978
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,400
Yeah.

1979
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,400
That was my favorite.

1980
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,400
A little bit homosexual.

1981
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,400
Just a little.

1982
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:49,040
Was it, was it commander or commander command like a Commodore 64 commander better?

1983
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,480
It was no.

1984
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,600
When I tell you who it was singing it, that's how you'll know how homosexual it was.

1985
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,600
You ready?

1986
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Yes.

1987
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,600
Kelly Rowland.

1988
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,600
Wow.

1989
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:03,680
Like the not Beyonce, but yeah, Beyonce, the other chick from Destiny's Child.

1990
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,680
Yes.

1991
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,680
Exactly.

1992
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,680
I can't believe it's not Beyonce.

1993
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,680
Hey, video game news.

1994
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,680
Oh my God.

1995
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,680
Who knew we did that on this show?

1996
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,720
Uh, a lot of quick video game news tonight.

1997
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,720
Holy hell.

1998
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,120
There's a lot of quick news tonight.

1999
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:19,080
And um, I believe Loki has a story starting off about fantasy star, but I want to say

2000
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,640
this first because this somehow did not even make our show roll, which is a travesty.

2001
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:29,240
Fantasy star online two teased in a trailer this week at Tokyo game show.

2002
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,240
What in the world?

2003
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,240
I know, right?

2004
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:34,200
The, because it's the 10th anniversary of fantasy star online and they have announced

2005
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:38,960
that next year they're going to put out fantasy star online two for PC.

2006
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,080
I'll play it.

2007
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,240
But it's not on console.

2008
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,800
That's weird to me that it's not on console.

2009
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,120
I'm wondering what they're going to do with it.

2010
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,480
They're still getting to MMOs on consoles.

2011
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:51,640
I mean, at least like the PlayStation three and Xbox 360 because so far this generation

2012
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,960
there's been Final Fantasy 11.

2013
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,960
Wasn't there another one on 360?

2014
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,960
Oh, fantasy star universe.

2015
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:58,960
Haha.

2016
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,960
Yeah, sort of.

2017
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:02,880
But that had a more of a single player component to it though.

2018
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,360
It wasn't just an MMO.

2019
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,320
This shut down.

2020
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,320
The game would still be playable.

2021
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,800
It's like a really bad anime.

2022
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,800
All right, sorry.

2023
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,240
I didn't mean to derail your story, Loki, but I had to throw that out there.

2024
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:18,360
Before the break, we were talking about advertisement and games and you know how it's kind of terrible

2025
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,360
sometimes.

2026
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,360
Well, this is how you do it.

2027
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:26,280
Damn it, because I couldn't think of a better way to possibly advertise in the game than

2028
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,080
how it's done in fantasy star portable two.

2029
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:34,760
What, may you ask, is actually the case with this?

2030
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,720
You can play Colonel Sanders in fantasy star portable two.

2031
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,720
That is awesome.

2032
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,720
Wait, wait, wait.

2033
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,720
Like a playable character?

2034
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,280
Like a playable character.

2035
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:47,840
Like the Colonel is there to kick ass.

2036
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:54,840
Back from the dead with his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices.

2037
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,920
I read some story that like most kids under 18 don't even know who Colonel Sanders is.

2038
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:06,920
Like, oh, but he's going to come and bitch slap him in the face now.

2039
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,480
Now you'll remember me forever.

2040
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:13,540
No, but seriously, it's, um, they put him in the game and this isn't a big surprise

2041
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:17,880
because actually, I believe it's in the upgraded version of fantasy star portable two.

2042
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,760
It's infinity, I guess.

2043
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:24,560
And the original fantasy star portable two actually had pizza hut stuff in there with

2044
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,640
like a pizza hut box shield.

2045
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:33,400
Oh hell, you know what that means coming in the next fantasy star game is Taco Bell.

2046
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,260
Make a run for the PSP.

2047
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,200
Or the noid comes back as a playable character.

2048
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,800
Dude, the noid would be awesome.

2049
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:44,320
I'm sorry, but if anyone's seen the anime project Aco, you don't mess with the Colonel.

2050
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
It's the Colonel.

2051
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,520
Oh, that's so ridiculous.

2052
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,680
Lee awesome.

2053
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,680
It is awesome.

2054
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,760
So instead of casting like the typical like ice fire bolt spells, you'll be casting like,

2055
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:06,520
you know, Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, heart attack, grease fire, KFC bowl, double

2056
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:13,880
down the, the bowl that looks like poop, wait, wait, wait.

2057
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,880
That's nasty.

2058
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,000
And they have pictures of him attacking stuff.

2059
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,740
So I'm trying to see what he, look, it almost looks like, and I kid you not, and I don't

2060
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:27,200
understand this, but it almost looks like he has a magic wand.

2061
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:32,040
Like he's fucking Harry Potter of the, you know, fast food world or something.

2062
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:37,040
Um, he's like hitting some, yeah, seriously looking like he's bitch slapping someone right

2063
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,040
there.

2064
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,760
Uh, this is all on Famitsu of course.

2065
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,720
I got it one more here cause it looks like he's throwing a fireball or something.

2066
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,600
Uh, God, I love the Japanese.

2067
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,800
Yeah, he's got like, seriously, he's got like a magical wand.

2068
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:57,360
I mean Colonel Sanders, dude, you put your name in the Goblet of Fire, going to our chat

2069
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:04,320
room and chat that orange lounge radio.com, um, SSG100 Matt says, gravy heel, please.

2070
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:09,920
Uh, Vid, Vid Power says, when are they going to make a fighter featuring the Arby's oven

2071
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,920
mitt?

2072
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,360
Uh, DDR dollar bill says you're Juan Sanders.

2073
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,840
Is it made from chicken feather?

2074
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,960
I seriously think a great, cause you know how Burger King does their stupid, like, you

2075
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,120
know, Burger King games, which I will, by the way, fucking rad, which is by the way,

2076
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,840
when they do release their Kinect games, I'm buying all of them.

2077
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:32,200
I don't care how terrible they are, because they're awesome.

2078
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:37,240
Seriously, KFC needs to come up with like an original game where it's like, oh, kids

2079
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:41,680
don't know who Colonel Sanders is, he's back to kick some fucking ass with his magical

2080
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,680
wand.

2081
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,000
He's a fucking ninja, that's what he is.

2082
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,840
Ooh, I'm back from the dead, ooh.

2083
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,600
He's gonna battle Voldemort as well.

2084
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,840
Is it bad that your little thing is blinking red?

2085
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,080
Does that mean it's gonna explode?

2086
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,960
Nah, it just means the battery's low.

2087
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:54,960
Okay.

2088
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,160
This means I won't have internet after a while.

2089
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,160
I'm so worried.

2090
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,160
Alright.

2091
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,160
It means the time bomb's going off.

2092
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,160
Oh no.

2093
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,160
I'm in my house.

2094
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,080
This show will self-destruct in 30 seconds.

2095
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,560
You brought Burger King into my house.

2096
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,560
Hasn't it already?

2097
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,640
Yeah, it's alright, anyways, I should finish my downloads when I get home, cause this is

2098
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,640
so slow.

2099
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:12,640
What are you downloading?

2100
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,640
Apps.

2101
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,640
Wow.

2102
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,440
I'm downloading the two Monkey Island apps.

2103
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,440
Oh.

2104
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,440
Sweet.

2105
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,840
But I thought those, that's not like a 4G router?

2106
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,200
No, it's just 3G.

2107
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,200
Oh.

2108
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,640
I don't know anything about it, sorry.

2109
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,640
Next story.

2110
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,640
But yeah.

2111
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:32,680
I'm sorry, it's just so awesome that we have to keep talking about the kernel.

2112
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:37,620
So Halo Reach, of course, you know, one of the big things with Halo, and it's kinda become

2113
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,600
infamous because of it.

2114
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:44,160
The horrible people on Xbox Live, and it's a lot of little kids that really shouldn't

2115
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,160
be playing-

2116
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:48,960
I love when you start off the horrible people on Xbox Live.

2117
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,740
It really, there's just a bunch of little kids that have no, should have no business

2118
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,040
playing this game.

2119
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,080
They're on there playing this game.

2120
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:03,480
So if you run across some douchebags that are playing the game and being jerks online

2121
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:09,360
and you mute them, if enough people mute them, they will just be auto-muted by everybody.

2122
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:14,160
So you won't have to listen to them over a period of time, so.

2123
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:18,360
But they just like to call people fun, amazing guys.

2124
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,840
Yep.

2125
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,480
Uh, yes.

2126
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,800
Wow.

2127
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,000
I praise your heterosexuality.

2128
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,800
We are friends.

2129
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,940
So that's available, of course, now.

2130
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:40,960
And then, apparently, who would have thought, the PSP2 is in the works, and in fact, the

2131
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:45,760
Mortal Kombat developers have a development unit of it right now.

2132
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:51,960
They say it's a pretty powerful machine, and that they will be working on games for it,

2133
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:57,760
and they said it's, they don't even have a 3DS yet, but apparently they have a PSP2.

2134
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:04,000
Perhaps the PSP2 will be launching next year, soon, hmm, maybe?

2135
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,400
So I guess we'll have to wait and see what they do to enhance stuff on that.

2136
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,960
Wow, newsflash, a PSP2 is in development, shock and awe.

2137
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,200
Yeah, but the news is that they- File that next to Duh, and of course.

2138
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:21,240
But the news is that they have a unit, and that it would probably be close to be releasing.

2139
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,840
Next year's E3.

2140
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,280
I'm sure it will be next holiday.

2141
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,280
For next holiday.

2142
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:30,040
Alongside Shattered Memories 2, the next winner of the E3 game.

2143
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,520
Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio, three games analysts.

2144
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,520
Ah, yes.

2145
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,160
Analists, sorry, analists.

2146
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:42,880
And Red Faction Armageddon is coming May 2011 next year, and of course that'll be the next

2147
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,840
big game from the Saints Row developers.

2148
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:52,760
And speaking of Saints Row, they will be putting out a new Saints Row game next fall.

2149
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,760
So sad.

2150
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,760
So far away.

2151
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,760
I love that game.

2152
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,360
I know you do.

2153
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,800
It's so terribly awesome.

2154
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,520
It really is.

2155
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,840
Well something maybe you could play in the meantime would be PopCap World, because PopCap

2156
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:11,200
and NCSoft have teamed up to bring you PopCap World, oh boy, because you have NCSoft who

2157
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,800
makes those highly addictive Korean MMOs, and then some of the ones over here too such

2158
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,440
as Ion and Guild Wars.

2159
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:24,440
And then PopCap, makers of virtual crack, like Pagle, Plants and Zombies, and Bejeweled.

2160
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:28,460
PopCap and NCSoft have come together to bring PopCap World.

2161
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,320
This platform will be launching later this year.

2162
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,840
It's going to be operated by NCSoft, it's going to feature 13 PopCap titles at launch.

2163
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:39,320
It's going to be free, with optional premium paid elements to be added later.

2164
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:43,640
It's going to have Bejeweled, and Plants vs. Zombies, and an all new multiplayer game called

2165
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,600
Super Zuma.

2166
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,720
Here's the other thing you should know about this, it's only for Korea, so it's not coming

2167
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:51,720
out here.

2168
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,800
Why the fuck did you tell us, Rob?

2169
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:55,920
Because I just want you to know what you're missing out on.

2170
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,680
Super Zuma, by the way, was quote, built exclusively for Korean players.

2171
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:06,160
So Super Zuma apparently uses Starcraft characters.

2172
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,640
And the screen is very narrow for their eyes.

2173
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,640
Stop it.

2174
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:12,180
Hey, I can say it, I'm Asian.

2175
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:13,180
You can say it.

2176
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,180
Yes I can.

2177
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,180
Alright.

2178
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:17,760
So yeah, that's going to be interesting.

2179
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,800
I'm surprised they won't release that here, but maybe Facebook games are doing well enough

2180
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:22,800
for them here.

2181
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,160
Did they ever release the Zuma game on Facebook?

2182
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:26,160
I don't know.

2183
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,160
I think they did zoom on Facebook.

2184
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:28,160
I think they were going to.

2185
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,920
They were going to do zoom on Facebook, and then of course there's Bejeweled.

2186
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,960
And now it's all about just cross-promoting their iPhone apps, that's how they're making

2187
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,960
money.

2188
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,800
Loki, do you have Plants vs. Zombies on your new iPod Touch?

2189
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,280
Yes I do, it's very fun.

2190
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:40,280
Awesome!

2191
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,560
Oh yeah, I played a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies this week.

2192
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,560
For the first time.

2193
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,920
Can you believe I've never played that game before, and I finally played it this week

2194
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,920
on Xbox Live?

2195
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,360
Crazy, I've never played it.

2196
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,360
It's crack rock.

2197
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,280
I mean, I've played a zillion and one tower defense games before, it's just, you know,

2198
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,280
this is another one.

2199
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,400
But it's cute.

2200
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,400
It's pop-crack.

2201
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,400
Mm-hmm.

2202
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,400
Mm-hmm.

2203
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,400
Hey!

2204
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,040
Speaking of other crack games, some people really love these games.

2205
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,680
Muramasa, the Demon Blade, and Odin Sphere.

2206
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:08,600
Yeah, these games are being remade in HD if rumors are to be believed.

2207
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,280
This is only rumor right now.

2208
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:15,480
The re-releases are highly likely for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

2209
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Here's the giveaway.

2210
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,480
They're being listed by the Australia ratings board as multi-platform.

2211
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,480
Hmm.

2212
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:25,160
Odin Sphere, of course, was originally on the PS2, Muramasa on the Wii.

2213
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:29,460
That would be kind of awesome if those games were re-released.

2214
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:32,880
The Last Guardian finally has a release date.

2215
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,880
Holiday 2011.

2216
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:37,600
You might remember, this was the game they showed, I think, in a trailer.

2217
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,760
Didn't they show this for the first time, like, last year's E3?

2218
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:41,760
I don't know.

2219
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,640
But they finally showed it at Tokyo Game Show.

2220
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:44,640
Another trailer.

2221
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:45,640
Oh.

2222
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,640
This is the Aiko show.

2223
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,640
Yes.

2224
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,640
The Colossus continuation.

2225
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:49,640
Yes.

2226
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:50,640
Holiday 2011.

2227
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,640
It looks epic.

2228
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,640
I mean, I gotta say.

2229
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,640
I'd play it.

2230
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:54,640
Yeah.

2231
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,640
It has a big, cute sort of puppy thing.

2232
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,640
Mm-hmm.

2233
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,640
I'd play it.

2234
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,640
Well, there's a whole little trailer here that was from Tokyo Game Show.

2235
01:45:58,640 --> 01:45:59,640
I'll play a little clip here.

2236
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,640
I don't want to play the whole thing.

2237
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,640
But you can see...

2238
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:02,640
Excuse me.

2239
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,640
Sorry.

2240
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:04,640
I watched this the other day.

2241
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:05,640
Look at that.

2242
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,640
There's that giant puppy thing.

2243
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,640
I don't know what the hell it is, but I'd play it.

2244
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,640
It looks like it's gonna crap on that guy.

2245
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,640
Probably because it is.

2246
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,640
Silent Hill is the poopy game.

2247
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,640
It's a dog, so...

2248
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,640
All right.

2249
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,600
Speaking of Aiko and Shadow of the Colossus, the collection that's been rumored for the

2250
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,120
past couple weeks, it's true.

2251
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:25,720
It's HD remakes coming exclusively to the PlayStation 3.

2252
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,360
They're also in 3D.

2253
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,360
Wow.

2254
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,360
But whatever.

2255
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,880
At least they're 2D as well.

2256
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,880
Yeah.

2257
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,080
They're coming to the PlayStation 3.

2258
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,580
They won't name a release date.

2259
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:43,720
They're just saying soon, but of course the retailers were rumoring April 2011.

2260
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:47,680
Sony Computer Entertainment America actually confirmed later spring 2011.

2261
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,240
So it's coming.

2262
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,800
There's box art and everything, and there's a trailer for that as well.

2263
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,640
The game looks sexy as hell, and I'm gonna admit, I didn't really play these games the

2264
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,640
first time around.

2265
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,200
I watched Loki play one of them.

2266
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,520
I watched a certain unnamed person play them.

2267
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,520
Really?

2268
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,520
Yeah.

2269
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,520
Are they hot?

2270
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:09,400
Yeah, all that Aiko is is this girl making a stupid noise following you, and then Shadow

2271
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,280
of the Colossus is like you're climbing a guy and killing him.

2272
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,280
I don't know.

2273
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,280
I mean, I'm sure it would be fun if you played it.

2274
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:17,280
You make these sound so stupid, but they're like some of the highest critically acclaimed

2275
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,280
games.

2276
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:19,280
You know, when you watch it, it's like, I don't know.

2277
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,080
It was boring to me, but I think if I played it, I'd probably like it better.

2278
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,360
Comment from our chat room from Spazinator PSN.

2279
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,120
Does that puppy thing remind you of the Luck Dragon from The Never Ending Story?

2280
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,120
Falkor?

2281
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,120
Fuck yeah.

2282
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:32,120
Kinda.

2283
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:34,120
Didn't he always sound like he was high?

2284
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,120
Falkor?

2285
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:39,720
He's like, oh yeah, scratch my ear.

2286
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,960
Also, get me some munchies, could ya?

2287
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,960
I've been laying here for like six hours really high.

2288
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,960
Sorry.

2289
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,960
Derailing.

2290
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,960
No, that's okay.

2291
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,000
It happens on the show as well.

2292
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,600
So where is Frank West in Dead Rising 2?

2293
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,320
He isn't showing up in the game and, you know, Frank West, of course, was the main character

2294
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,760
in Dead Rising 1.

2295
01:47:58,760 --> 01:47:59,760
Well, he's been found.

2296
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:00,760
He's covered wars, you know.

2297
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:01,760
What?

2298
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,440
I said he's covered wars, you know.

2299
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,440
That's right.

2300
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:09,200
He's coming to a new game called Dead Rising Case West.

2301
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,200
That's right.

2302
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,200
It's an epilogue to Dead Rising 2.

2303
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,200
Aha!

2304
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,280
So Dead Rising Case 0 was the prologue.

2305
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,120
Case West will now be the epilogue.

2306
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,120
Get it?

2307
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,120
Cool.

2308
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,200
That's why you've seen photos of the two characters standing next to each other.

2309
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,120
Case West is gonna be a download title.

2310
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,960
It's gonna be exclusive on the Xbox 360.

2311
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,400
It will have co-op play where one of you is Chuck and one of you is Frank.

2312
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,400
Cool.

2313
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:39,880
Sorry to my gay friends, but no word about hot man-on-man action with the Chuck and Frank.

2314
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,160
Boo!

2315
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,160
Next topic.

2316
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,160
Okay.

2317
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,280
No gayness in this one.

2318
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,640
On that topic, does Dark Star, you've heard of the Doctor Who game, right?

2319
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,640
Yes.

2320
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,240
And, you know, considering how the Russell T. Davies is like the head of Doctor Who,

2321
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,680
do you think there'll be any man-on-man action in the game?

2322
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,840
We need Captain Jack in it.

2323
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,640
We need Captain Jack and the 50 million gay kisses he has on Torchwood.

2324
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:02,640
Yes.

2325
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,640
Yeah.

2326
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,640
Oh, you've heard about the new season of Torchwood.

2327
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,640
Hold on.

2328
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:07,640
The gay alarm is going off.

2329
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,640
The show got too gay.

2330
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,640
What?

2331
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,640
What?

2332
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:11,640
Good job.

2333
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,640
Sorry, John Barrowman.

2334
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,640
We're in Rob Network.

2335
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,640
We're going down the homosexual limit.

2336
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:15,640
That's right.

2337
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:19,920
We just got an order from the police department of Sacramento to turn down the gayness a little

2338
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,920
bit, please.

2339
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,920
All right.

2340
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,920
Man up, guys.

2341
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:23,920
Too late.

2342
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,920
Too late.

2343
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:25,920
Well, how about some other news, Rob?

2344
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:26,920
Yes.

2345
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:32,600
How about Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has characters that make me absolutely absolutely mad.

2346
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,600
Absolutely.

2347
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,600
Really, really happy.

2348
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,600
Horny.

2349
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,600
Wow.

2350
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,600
I thought this was what she was going to say.

2351
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:40,920
Wasn't going to go there, but all right.

2352
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,640
I said happy.

2353
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:45,040
X-23 is in the game.

2354
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,920
That makes me happy.

2355
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:52,200
As in the chick clone of Wolverine, who's actually kind of awesome.

2356
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,200
And hot?

2357
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,400
Dark Sakura hot?

2358
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,480
I guess if you like.

2359
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,200
So then you would be a little horny.

2360
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,200
I'm just kidding.

2361
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:03,000
I would bite my butt, Rob.

2362
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,660
And of course, you know, we also have Tron Bon in there.

2363
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:13,640
And also other characters announced for Street Fighter IV.

2364
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:16,020
This is pretty cool, is Yun and Yang.

2365
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:18,280
So pretty cool.

2366
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,280
From Street Fighter III.

2367
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,040
I think that's pretty cool.

2368
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:24,480
They were fun to play.

2369
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,480
And Chun-Li.

2370
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,680
I do not like Chun-Li.

2371
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:31,960
She's in every fucking Street Fighter game except the very first one.

2372
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,400
Fighting Street.

2373
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:42,280
And then IGN found a game breaking bug in a certain game that we like to complain about

2374
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,280
sometimes.

2375
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,240
Even though I don't think any of us in here have played it.

2376
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:50,440
Metroid Other M. I just know it's crap.

2377
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,440
3D Metroid.

2378
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,400
I'm not passing judgment until I play it.

2379
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:57,200
And Rice Princess doesn't like any of the 3D Metroid games.

2380
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:58,200
So she's biased.

2381
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,920
I also don't like horseless carriages and metal birds.

2382
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,440
Who are you?

2383
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:11,280
At any rate, the bug, if you are in Sector 3 and a certain door stays locked, you'll

2384
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,720
be locked there forever.

2385
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:13,720
You're just stuck.

2386
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:18,420
You're kind of like there being no boss at level 30.

2387
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:23,820
And Nintendo did confirm it and they said that right now the only solutions are to load

2388
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:27,640
an earlier save or start over from the beginning.

2389
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,120
What a solution.

2390
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:32,120
They haven't said anything about fixing it.

2391
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:35,480
They're like, duh stupid, just restart the game.

2392
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,480
That also happened in the...

2393
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,280
And the best part is they can't fix it because the Wii doesn't patch games.

2394
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,600
No, but that also happened in...

2395
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:45,600
There's a potential that they can patch it through a firmware update.

2396
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,600
Oh, interesting.

2397
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,600
They can't.

2398
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,600
Poop.

2399
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,600
Oh yeah.

2400
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,600
Poop.

2401
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:51,600
Well, and good news.

2402
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,600
Good happy news.

2403
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,600
Where's my...

2404
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,600
What are you gonna do?

2405
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,600
Rob.

2406
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,600
What?

2407
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,600
Hi.

2408
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,600
Fanfare.

2409
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,600
I don't have a fanfare.

2410
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,600
Hold on.

2411
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,600
Well then sing it.

2412
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,600
Poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

2413
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:03,600
Thank you, Irene.

2414
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,600
Okay.

2415
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,600
You're welcome.

2416
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,600
Why don't I?

2417
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,600
I'm getting your fanfare music.

2418
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,600
But we already did it, Rob.

2419
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,600
We're done.

2420
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,600
You don't need to do it anymore.

2421
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,600
It has the stamp of Irene on it.

2422
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,600
Yes.

2423
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,600
Hold on.

2424
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:14,600
Okay, here's your fanfare.

2425
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:20,600
I knew it.

2426
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,880
One of the best shooting games ever.

2427
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:24,880
And it's Tres-Ar goodness.

2428
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:28,680
And I have to say it's Tres-Ar, because it's treasure.

2429
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:37,860
Iridion Silver Gun, yay, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, yay.

2430
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:42,080
And it'll be out in 2011, exclusively on Xbox Live Arcade.

2431
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:46,600
It will have updated graphics, online co-op, and an Ikaruga mode.

2432
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,600
Ikaruga?

2433
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,600
Oh my.

2434
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:53,540
And then that means that I don't have to spend $400 to play it at home.

2435
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:55,920
Just some Microsoft points.

2436
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,340
That's always good.

2437
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:03,800
The last time I played Ikaruga was on an arcade machine in Las Vegas.

2438
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:04,800
Wow.

2439
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,400
So that was a long time ago.

2440
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:10,720
The last time I played Ikaruga was one of the boss fights in Tournament of the Champions.

2441
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:11,720
Not Ikaruga.

2442
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:12,720
Radiant Silver Gun.

2443
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,000
Last time I played Radiant Silver Gun.

2444
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,160
Oh, okay.

2445
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,360
And I touched a Saturn copy at California Extreme.

2446
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,360
It was pretty.

2447
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,360
It was expensive.

2448
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,480
They wanted like $600 for it.

2449
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,360
No, that's California Extreme!

2450
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:25,360
Extreme!

2451
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,360
Thank you, Eddie.

2452
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,360
Extremely nerdy.

2453
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,360
It was awesome.

2454
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:35,080
So Radiant Silver Gun, Dan, we're getting this!

2455
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,080
He's so excited.

2456
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,680
How about Twitter topics?

2457
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:38,680
No.

2458
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,680
Okay.

2459
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:45,000
Uh, every week we read your tweets at Twitter.com slash OLR, and I forgot to ask for them tonight,

2460
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,680
so we have very few from tweeters who remember that we do this every week.

2461
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,680
Rob, fail.

2462
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,680
That's all right, we'll do it with you.

2463
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:53,640
Well, if you want, if you wanted to get in a tweet and you forgot, you could hurry up

2464
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:56,520
and send an email, because I don't think Dark Saga's opened the mailbag yet, so you can

2465
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:57,520
hurry.

2466
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,520
Yes.

2467
01:53:58,520 --> 01:53:59,520
Dope.

2468
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,520
All right, uh, let's see.

2469
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,960
Twitter.com slash OLR.

2470
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,440
Pot Culture sent a tweet.

2471
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,560
It actually isn't really directly related to the show, but I thought it was interesting.

2472
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:10,680
He says, sorry gang, not gonna make the live feed tonight, playing a bit of Phantasy Star

2473
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:12,540
Portable 2 then calling it a night.

2474
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:15,960
By the way, code required for online multiplayer in PSP 2.

2475
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:20,200
Now it looks like Sega's jumped on board with that whole thing.

2476
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,200
Yay.

2477
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:26,560
Blue Swim sends us a tweet with a story about Microsoft believes that Kinect will blow away

2478
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,000
iPad sales.

2479
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
What?

2480
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,680
Good luck with that.

2481
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,760
Totally unrelated product comparison.

2482
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,800
I know, right?

2483
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:36,800
Seriously?

2484
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,800
I don't see how that's gonna work.

2485
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,040
Christmas gifts, maybe?

2486
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,040
I don't know.

2487
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:48,160
Well, I could see that because, you know, the Kinect is only 150 bucks.

2488
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:56,520
The comments coming from Kudosunoda of Microsoft saying this, quote, the preorders have been

2489
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:57,680
really strong.

2490
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:01,000
As far as what we're looking at for holiday, this is going to be stuff that'll blow away

2491
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,160
any of the sales you've seen with the iPad.

2492
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,360
This is in a remarks to Gamasutra.

2493
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:09,280
The Xbox 360 is already selling better than the Wii and Sony right now.

2494
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:12,800
Kinect's really just going to boost that to a whole new level.

2495
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,120
And my television will outsell my car.

2496
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,240
I think that they're comparing numbers.

2497
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:21,260
I think all they're doing is comparing numbers.

2498
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:26,120
And then Aaron Greenberg joins in saying, quote, we believe this will be the biggest

2499
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,360
launch in our history for Xbox.

2500
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:35,040
We will sell more Kinect sensors than we did systems at Xbox 360 launch and like such as

2501
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,920
in the maps and the Iraq.

2502
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,400
Here's kind of a side related question.

2503
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:42,520
Do you guys think that Xbox actually is not planning on another system in the next couple

2504
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:43,520
of years?

2505
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,440
Let me get to that a minute, but first, A, they're going to sell more Kinects than Xbox

2506
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:52,760
360s at launch because there weren't any fucking Xbox 360s available at launch.

2507
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:53,760
Remember?

2508
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:54,760
Never forget.

2509
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:58,200
There was like no 360s anywhere for like six months.

2510
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,160
They were in very limited supplies.

2511
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:02,280
I see what you're doing there, you little...

2512
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,280
Liar.

2513
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,280
Yep.

2514
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:05,280
All right.

2515
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,840
Now, what was the other question?

2516
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,840
I'm sorry.

2517
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:11,200
Well, they've kind of alluded to this is they're not coming out with a new system for a while.

2518
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,280
I'm wondering if that's just a bunch of crap.

2519
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,440
Actually, I believe it.

2520
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:19,160
I think the gap is going to be a little longer than you've seen in years past.

2521
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:23,160
I think though the seal is going to get broken probably in the next couple of years.

2522
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:26,280
I think Nintendo will be the first to do it, but next year they're going to be riding the

2523
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:30,360
wave of the 3DS, but I think maybe the year after that they're going to name the Wii successor

2524
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:33,740
and I think that'll kind of be the first in a wave.

2525
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:36,680
Probably Microsoft at about two years will announce their successor too.

2526
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:41,160
I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of updates to current consoles going on is

2527
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,960
because A, it's all about the digital distribution and upgrades.

2528
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:51,360
B, it's because of the economy and people don't have $400, $500, $600 to jump on a brand

2529
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,880
new system.

2530
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,600
I know what they're going to release next.

2531
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,600
Uh-oh.

2532
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:56,600
What?

2533
01:56:56,600 --> 01:57:01,080
They're going to release the Xbox 360 that doesn't get the red ring of death.

2534
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,280
That'll be their new console.

2535
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:08,760
Technically, they did release that new Xbox 360, don't call it a slim, but the slimmer

2536
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:09,760
360.

2537
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,760
Uh-huh.

2538
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:11,760
That's out now.

2539
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,760
More breakable.

2540
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:13,760
No, it can't red ring because it doesn't have rings.

2541
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:14,760
Oh.

2542
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,760
Clever.

2543
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:16,760
Well played, Microsoft.

2544
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:17,760
I'm onto you, though.

2545
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:26,960
No, it also has its senses and if the internal parts are getting too hot, which causes that,

2546
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,640
it actually shuts the system down before it will red ring.

2547
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:30,640
Wait, wait.

2548
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,640
Oh, wonderful.

2549
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,520
That's the worst solution ever.

2550
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,320
Oh, man.

2551
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,320
Or as Frisbee in chat calls it, the Xbox 360.

2552
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:42,360
Oh, guffaw, guffaw, guffaw.

2553
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:45,800
Oh, good one.

2554
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,960
Here's the thing, though.

2555
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,520
Don't be too excited for the next consoles because I'm going to tell you, especially

2556
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:55,560
probably from Sony's camp, the next series of consoles, one of them's going to get ballsy

2557
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:57,560
and it'll probably be Sony.

2558
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,120
Totally digital distribution.

2559
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,120
Just wait.

2560
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,120
Okay.

2561
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:02,120
It's a digital distribution.

2562
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,640
Then the games better be cheaper.

2563
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:07,640
They won't.

2564
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:08,640
I don't care.

2565
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,360
Hey, we've got more tweets from Tiger Claw.

2566
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:11,360
A what?

2567
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:16,360
Hi, Tiger Claw.

2568
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:21,160
I'm looking at Matt over here and he's got the mic rested on his chin and he's working

2569
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:24,680
on his iPad touch, so it's multitasking over here.

2570
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:25,680
Anyhow.

2571
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:30,160
I'm playing Plants vs. Zombies.

2572
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:36,160
Tiger Claw and Link, speaking of Apple and apps and stuff, they rejected the Onions shoot

2573
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:38,800
people point blank in the face game.

2574
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,800
What?

2575
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:40,800
Why?

2576
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:41,800
That's really too bad.

2577
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:44,400
There's actually a little trailer here that you can watch.

2578
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,400
Okay.

2579
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,400
My fantasy.

2580
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,400
Oh, this is a whole little, hold on, they're showing it at first.

2581
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:51,120
We're about to have a photo of Loki playing.

2582
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:55,880
But apparently the Onion wrote about a fictional first person shooter.

2583
01:58:55,880 --> 01:59:00,120
It's called Close Range and you just repeatedly shoot people and animals point blank in the

2584
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:01,120
face.

2585
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,720
Wait, that's a game?

2586
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,880
You mean that's not every first person shooter?

2587
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:13,000
Video game fans are lining up today to be the first to purchase Close Range.

2588
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,180
The hotly anticipated video game in which players repeatedly shoot people point blank

2589
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,180
in the face.

2590
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:22,400
Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.

2591
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,400
Thanks Bobby.

2592
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:27,900
Close Range is already being hailed by critics as the most important game of the year.

2593
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:32,320
The first person shooter creates an immersive richly detailed world where players shoot

2594
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,960
people in the face with guns.

2595
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:36,840
Reviewers say it brings a new level of depth to gaming.

2596
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:40,600
Just like great literature film transports you to different worlds, Close Range transports

2597
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,640
you to a world where you fire bullets into an endless stream of faces.

2598
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:49,320
Fans say it's the game's well developed characters and storyline that make Close Range so compelling.

2599
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:52,920
You just feel like you're inside this complex character who's thrust into a world where

2600
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,320
he has to blow people's heads off.

2601
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:59,440
The plot follows AJ, a man with a mysterious past who must explode hundreds of thousands

2602
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:03,060
of human faces on a quest to save his kidnapped brother.

2603
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,680
Who are you?

2604
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:06,760
Someone who can help.

2605
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,600
I know where your brother is.

2606
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:09,600
Tell me.

2607
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:10,600
Look out!

2608
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:14,100
But Close Range's single player story is just the beginning.

2609
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:19,340
Its outstanding multiplayer mode offers unparalleled interactivity by allowing players to blast

2610
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:20,760
each other's faces off.

2611
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,960
It's completely open-ended.

2612
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:25,240
You can shoot someone in the ear, but you can also shoot them in the eye.

2613
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:28,880
With hundreds of hidden extras like side missions where players can take a break from shooting

2614
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:33,440
people in the face to shoot animals in the face, Close Range will keep players from floating

2615
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,440
in the face.

2616
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:39,520
And with the sequel, Close Range 2 Chainsaw Dawn continuing the epic story next fall,

2617
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,800
Close Range fans have even more to look forward to.

2618
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,960
For the Onion News Network, I'm Geoff Tate.

2619
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,960
Thanks Geoff.

2620
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:46,960
Wow.

2621
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,400
That was pretty amazing.

2622
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:52,800
And I know that probably made for horrible radio, but they really did show, they really

2623
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:58,120
did show people like shooting at Close Range face, and then there was a horse and an ostrich.

2624
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:01,840
I just, I don't see the difference, isn't that every first person shooter game?

2625
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,280
Ga-faw, ga-faw, ga-faw.

2626
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,920
Anyhow, the Onion actually made it a game and submitted Close Range to sell on the App

2627
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,040
Store.

2628
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:13,200
But Apple, I would have bought it, shit.

2629
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,360
But you know Loki's looking it up right now.

2630
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,600
No, I already saw that news report.

2631
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:19,440
We'll check the jailbreak for us.

2632
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:22,400
Apple rejected it due to violence.

2633
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:27,960
However, they have, the Onion has revised the game and resubmitted it.

2634
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:29,480
But good luck.

2635
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:35,400
The iPad and iPhone App Stores prohibits apps portraying realistic images of people or animals

2636
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:38,240
being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured or injured.

2637
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,360
That didn't look really realistic.

2638
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:42,920
That's awesome.

2639
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,640
They must be on lots of crack to have that be their idea of realism.

2640
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:53,420
Hey, also from Tiger Claw, I know he wants us to know that the SingStar Dance Track List

2641
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:54,420
is out.

2642
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:58,140
That's right, because now, with thanks to the PlayStation Move, not only do you get

2643
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:00,920
to sing, but you get to dance in SingStar.

2644
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:01,920
Yay.

2645
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:05,040
Irene's really excited for my next SingStar party, aren't you?

2646
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,040
Totally.

2647
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,040
I can't wait.

2648
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,440
Well, here's some of the hits you can do in this new game for SingStar Dance.

2649
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:16,880
In Sync, Bye Bye Bye, Blondie, Heart of Glass, Cyndi Lauper, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Gwen

2650
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,720
Stefani, Whatchu Waitin' For?, Casey and the Sunshine Band, That's the Way I Like It, La

2651
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:23,600
Rue with Bulletproof.

2652
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:24,600
That's a popular one.

2653
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:29,920
Lady Gaga with Poker Face, New Kids on the Block with Hangin' Tough, Paula Abdul was

2654
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:37,000
Straight Up, Real Too Real with I Like to Move It, The Backstreet Boys with Everybody

2655
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:43,120
Backstreet's Back, and Irene's personal favorite, The Black Eyed Peas with Shut Up.

2656
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,720
Shut Up!

2657
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:45,720
Nuh-uh.

2658
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:46,720
Great.

2659
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:49,220
That's awesome.

2660
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,720
I'm pre-ordering that game right?

2661
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:52,720
Never.

2662
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,720
Alright.

2663
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:55,600
That's it for the Twitter topic.

2664
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,880
Sorry to those folks that didn't get their tweets read.

2665
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:00,880
You'll just have to tweet us a little faster next time, won't you?

2666
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:01,880
Back to some gaming news.

2667
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:06,440
Loki, I hate to tear you away from Plants vs. Zombies, but I'm thinking you might want

2668
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:07,840
to read some stories for our listeners.

2669
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:08,840
Sure, why not.

2670
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:10,800
Or we can just watch more Onion videos all night.

2671
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:11,800
Onion Lounge Radio, really.

2672
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,800
You know, whatever.

2673
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,800
It's better.

2674
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:19,200
Uh, EA apparently has not received significant backlash to their online pass.

2675
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:24,000
Remember, the online pass is part of their Project 10 dollars, which is the dumbest name

2676
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:30,880
for a project ever, and it charges 10 dollars for access to online games, or online modes

2677
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:33,640
in games, if you purchase the game used.

2678
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:38,600
It says, people know that bandwidth isn't free, so the fact that we are diffusing online

2679
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:43,880
costs isn't seen as unreasonable.

2680
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:47,600
That makes no sense, I'll just say.

2681
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:49,860
In other words, people aren't complaining enough.

2682
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:50,860
So complain more.

2683
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:51,860
That's a dumb excuse.

2684
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:54,520
They're all, oh, bandwidth's not free.

2685
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,360
Well, here's the thing.

2686
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:59,600
They say it just like that, too, bandwidth's not free.

2687
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:03,800
No, they say it more like this, bandwidth's not free!

2688
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:06,560
Well, here's the problem, though.

2689
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,400
People bought the game new to begin with.

2690
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:14,920
So if, say, I bought a game for 60 dollars, and then sold it to Rob, or, you know, sold

2691
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:19,400
it back to GameStop, and then Rob bought a used copy, okay, there's still the same amount

2692
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:21,800
of people playing online, potentially.

2693
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:29,040
But, you see, they were robbed of the 60 dollar new game that that person might have potentially

2694
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,040
bought.

2695
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:31,900
It's still the same amount of people playing online.

2696
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:35,640
They wouldn't have bought because it's 60 dollars, they buy used games because they're

2697
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:39,400
cheaper, and they probably would have just pirated it.

2698
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:44,860
Do I have to go down to their fucking offices with a basket of apples and show them, okay,

2699
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:49,720
if I give you an apple, or, okay, how many apples do you have?

2700
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:50,720
You have one apple?

2701
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:51,720
Okay.

2702
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:55,640
Say you sell the apple used back to GameStop, you have now zero apples.

2703
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:58,680
I don't think GameStop buys apples.

2704
02:04:58,680 --> 02:04:59,680
It doesn't matter, okay?

2705
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:01,320
Although I'd like to see you try.

2706
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,320
Okay, so.

2707
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:05,320
Yes, I'd like to sell back this apple.

2708
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:09,520
Um, sir, we don't buy apples.

2709
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:15,720
So, EA, I purchased this apple from you, okay, for 60 dollars.

2710
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:18,200
You have my 60 dollars, okay?

2711
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:22,560
I take this apple and give it to my friend, Rob, okay?

2712
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,700
Rob has not paid you 60 dollars, but he'll be using this apple to play online.

2713
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:31,720
I will no longer be playing online with this apple because I don't have an apple anymore.

2714
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:33,520
How many people are playing online with this apple?

2715
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,760
Wait, wait, wait, but you said you brought a basket of apples, so you actually have like

2716
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:38,760
20 more apples sitting in the basket.

2717
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:41,680
Exactly, and I've paid for all those copies of the games, Brandon.

2718
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:43,760
I want to see these amazing online apples.

2719
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,720
I'm just gonna go online and download the apple for free.

2720
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:49,200
That's what I'm gonna do.

2721
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,680
It comes down to it, that's just a dumb excuse.

2722
02:05:51,680 --> 02:06:00,160
That would be like saying, um, oh, let's see here, Rob, um, you know, I went ahead and

2723
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:03,760
made this nice dinner out of food that I purchased from the grocery store.

2724
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:07,200
However, for you to eat that dinner, you're gonna have to pay that grocery store 10 dollars

2725
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:13,760
because, you know, they lost out the sales of you purchasing food from the grocery store,

2726
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:19,600
despite the fact that they still have the same amount of food in the grocery store,

2727
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:21,600
you know, regardless.

2728
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,120
They've lost no money.

2729
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:26,480
I will not.

2730
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,000
My voice must be heard.

2731
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,720
The problem is they're not fighting, they're basically just, you know, saying, oh, well,

2732
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:37,320
you know, bandwidth costs money, and gamers are like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

2733
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:43,200
Instead of going, wait a second, I paid them for that bandwidth already.

2734
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:48,900
Going to a chat room at chat.orangesontraday.com, Spassinator PSN says, that's like GM complaining

2735
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:51,920
that a car dealership sells used cars.

2736
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:57,320
Dark Tetsuya says, wow, I haven't heard Loki say Apple this much since his latest Mac rant.

2737
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:00,800
Dark Tetsuya says, Apple Lounge Radio.

2738
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:11,240
And lastly, Segg says, but I'm sure they sell lemons.

2739
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:16,760
Here's my answer to why they haven't seen that much backlash yet as far as the online

2740
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:21,600
passing goes, because not a lot of people buy EA Sports games used.

2741
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:25,320
I'm guessing that most people buy them brand new when they first come out because they

2742
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,520
have to have their EA Sports games.

2743
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:31,200
And I'm sure that a lot of people that have bought EA Sports games are probably only buying

2744
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:38,520
one or two EA Sports games, not everybody's buying Tiger, NCAA Football, Madden, NHL,

2745
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:42,000
no one's buying everything.

2746
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,040
So I'm going to guess that's probably why that no one's bitching about it, but I bet

2747
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:49,720
you anything if this comes out a Medal of Honor or something like that and a bunch of

2748
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:55,080
people are buying it used later on, there will be people bitching.

2749
02:07:55,080 --> 02:08:00,600
Xam in our chat room says, Apple's online, the latest fruit-based MMORPG following Fruit

2750
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:03,720
Base Fantasy XI and Papaya Star Online.

2751
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:08,360
But remember, see, if you don't speak up, then they're just going to assume that everything

2752
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:12,320
is okay, so, you know, whatever.

2753
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,320
We tried, we tried.

2754
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:16,400
Of course, their sales aren't going to hurt at all because, you know, Madden's going to

2755
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:22,080
be the top selling game, but like if you know EA, say, for example, puts out, I don't know,

2756
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:28,800
an MMO version of, like, Littlest Pet Shop or something like that and charges $10 for

2757
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:32,400
online, I'm sure a lot of people won't buy, well actually fuck that, no one's going to

2758
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,400
buy that game anyways.

2759
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:35,600
What am I talking about?

2760
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:37,840
Little girls everywhere want that game.

2761
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:39,680
No, they have Hello Kitty online.

2762
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:43,000
Fine, you're right, EA, you should be charging more for online.

2763
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,560
In fact, you should charge them $120.

2764
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:47,000
Why stop at $10?

2765
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
That's just ridiculous.

2766
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,480
How about $10 a month?

2767
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:55,280
In fact, I think you should charge them whatever year it is, so, you know, $2010, $2010 to

2768
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,320
get online.

2769
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:58,880
That sounds reasonable.

2770
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:04,360
Hey, going over to the Kinect and Microsoft, some news about the whole camera scanning

2771
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,120
feature that's going on there.

2772
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:11,160
You remember when they first showed Kinect, in that whole little Milo demo, they showed

2773
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:15,000
like, ooh, I'm going to draw Milo a picture and put it up on the camera and he's going

2774
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
to, like, show me-

2775
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,200
That's a wonderful penis you've drawn for me!

2776
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,280
Pretty much was the demo they were showing, right?

2777
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:26,280
But then when they actually showed the games you could play, it was all flail 2000 and

2778
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:28,840
dance and wave my hands.

2779
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:33,720
And there really was nothing about, oh, it reads paper or any of that stuff, right?

2780
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:34,720
Well-

2781
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:39,300
Have you, by the way, not the, this is still about Milo, have you seen the new Milo demo

2782
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,200
video that they had out there?

2783
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:46,120
It was, I forget what conference is being shown at, but it, and this isn't like a bad

2784
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:51,240
joke or anything, they were actually showing it, apparently he's like moved to the US because

2785
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:54,920
his family is having, they're conflicting or something like that.

2786
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:58,520
But the thing is, is like you're outside, you're following him around and helping him

2787
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:02,720
find snails and stuff like that and talking to this little kid and he has to like run

2788
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,080
inside his house and stuff.

2789
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:08,240
And to me it seems like kind of like a first person version of like some creepy pedophile

2790
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:11,760
that's hiding in your yard, you know, talking to this little boy.

2791
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:12,760
Pedobear of the game.

2792
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:15,480
Seriously, it's Pedobear of the game.

2793
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:19,240
Anyways, back to the scanning stuff.

2794
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:23,080
Maybe now's not a good time to talk about Kinect Joyride, which is the game I was actually

2795
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:24,080
going to talk about.

2796
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:27,680
They were showing off a demo of this at Tokyo Game Show.

2797
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:32,640
Big Park, the developers behind Joyride, which is a Microsoft owned studio, they actually

2798
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:35,640
have worked in some of the camera capture into this game.

2799
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:40,400
Here's the weird thing, what it does, when you do your vehicle customization options,

2800
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,140
you can pick your car's color.

2801
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:46,960
But if you don't like the colors in the game, Kinect will look at an item that you put in

2802
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:51,560
front of the camera and put its color on the car.

2803
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:57,640
So how long until a car that is colored the same color as someone's penis?

2804
02:10:57,640 --> 02:10:59,640
That's what I want to know.

2805
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:04,800
That's really cool.

2806
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:07,600
That's the wonders of modern technology.

2807
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:09,600
It matches colors.

2808
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:11,600
Good job.

2809
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,600
Cocky.

2810
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:20,880
By the way, you could also capture textures and that whole thing in LittleBigPlanet.

2811
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,480
Also by the way, last year or two years ago, I would already read pictures in front of

2812
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:27,000
the Playstation Eye.

2813
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,280
This actually isn't anything new, just so you know.

2814
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:31,280
Thanks Rob.

2815
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,280
You're welcome.

2816
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:33,280
Dark Sakura!

2817
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,800
We have something that's a little bit more fun than that.

2818
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:39,760
You can hack your shoes into Wiimotes.

2819
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:45,000
Basically this guy named Nick Marsh hacked his Nike shoes, they specifically say Nike,

2820
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:51,260
ooh, to make Wii controllers as part of the Nike 78 project, where they asked 78 artists

2821
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:54,000
to be creative with their shoes.

2822
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:00,040
So what it does is actually it changes the way a lot of these games are played.

2823
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:10,040
I think that he's using Wii Sports or one of these balance board games and using a chair

2824
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:14,080
so he's jumping up and down for doing the little dance thing.

2825
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:18,960
And then, but it looks like he can actually do the running and play stuff.

2826
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:23,280
It looks like he's having an epileptic seizure, like I'm sorry.

2827
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:27,120
I'm just waiting for that dog in that one video to come out and push the chair before

2828
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:28,120
he sits down.

2829
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:30,520
When he falls on his ass, have you guys seen this video?

2830
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:31,520
It's great.

2831
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:37,440
But I mean, it looks like though it totally adds a lot more of a different dimension to

2832
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:38,440
the game.

2833
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,440
I mean, like it could be more active.

2834
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,440
Oh, it's Wii Boxing.

2835
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:42,920
Oh, is that what it is?

2836
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,560
Well, no, he's doing Wii Aerobics or something.

2837
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:45,560
No, he's doing the dancing, whatever.

2838
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:46,560
The dancing one.

2839
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:47,560
On stage.

2840
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:51,480
It looks like somebody is like shooting bullets at his feet.

2841
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:52,480
That's what it looks like.

2842
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,240
I think it's neat though.

2843
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:55,240
I think it's really cool.

2844
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,240
I'm a maniac, maniac.

2845
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:58,520
That's what it looks like.

2846
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:03,120
Yeah, I guess if you want to look more ridiculous doing stuff on the Wii, yeah.

2847
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:07,400
But I mean, when he wasn't using the chair, it did look like he was actually kind of dancing

2848
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:10,960
along with the people on the screen instead of just using the balance board, you know?

2849
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,080
It looked like it would be fun.

2850
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:16,840
It was just weird that he had to keep sitting on that chair, but you know, whatever.

2851
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:18,080
It's like using the bar in DDR.

2852
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:20,320
Not going to judge, not going to judge.

2853
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:24,000
Mailbag and the FUs of the Wii coming up after just a couple more stories.

2854
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Loki.

2855
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Yes.

2856
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,600
And apparently there's a new game coming out called Shadows of the Damned.

2857
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:33,800
You said a bad word.

2858
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:37,160
Yes I did.

2859
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:45,120
Apparently this is the long awaited collaboration of Suda51, Akami, and EA.

2860
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:51,200
And of course this new game is going to be a psychological action thriller.

2861
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:52,200
And he said-

2862
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:55,160
There's some Shadows of the Damned going on in the next room, right?

2863
02:13:55,160 --> 02:14:00,600
According to Suda, he said he and Akami wanted to make this game for a long time.

2864
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:03,360
He searched for the right publisher to bring it to the audience.

2865
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:06,600
Finally, they said that they can reveal the game they've been working on together with

2866
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,600
EA.

2867
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:10,760
It's expected to release in 2011.

2868
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:13,680
And yeah, it's pretty cool.

2869
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:17,840
I know he was working on another game also, which is kind of cool.

2870
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:21,080
And I believe Akira Yomoka is doing music for that one.

2871
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:22,080
So that's pretty sweet.

2872
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:23,080
What?

2873
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:28,240
Yeah, well Akira Yomoka left Konami and he's supposedly partnering with EA now, so this

2874
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:29,240
makes sense.

2875
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:30,240
Bravo!

2876
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:31,240
Akira Yomoka.

2877
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:33,880
This is going to be a heck of a game, but we don't know anything but a title, right?

2878
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:35,320
Nothing right now, yeah.

2879
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,320
Not even a screenshot.

2880
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:37,320
Nothing.

2881
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:38,320
Nothing.

2882
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,560
It's going to be all like stick figures and psychological action.

2883
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:44,160
It'll probably be a big thing at E3 next year, I'm imagining.

2884
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:47,100
Oh, like Shattered Memories was?

2885
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:49,160
That was a psychological thriller.

2886
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:51,400
But that also was a different developer.

2887
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:53,120
It wasn't an EA game.

2888
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:54,520
I know, it was shit.

2889
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,520
I heard.

2890
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,960
I heard your strong feelings about this earlier.

2891
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:02,480
Speaking of things that Irene is a big fan of, it was officially announced this week

2892
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:07,440
through Mila Jovovich that another Resident Evil movie is definitely coming.

2893
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:08,440
What do you mean?

2894
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:10,200
With that like open ending?

2895
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,200
No!

2896
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:13,640
Surely you just.

2897
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:18,000
Quote Mila Jovovich in the New York magazine, quote, this new Resident Evil is the first

2898
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,800
one to ever open at number one worldwide.

2899
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,640
It's the biggest movie in the franchise.

2900
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:25,400
So we're definitely going to make another one.

2901
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:31,380
She's also asking fans to send suggestions for the next film to her Twitter page.

2902
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:37,300
So if you want to tweet her and tell her some ideas, like make a movie that doesn't suck,

2903
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:42,480
you could tweet her at M-I-L-L-A J-O-V-O-V-I-C-H.

2904
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:45,200
Because you don't know how to spell it.

2905
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:46,200
Alright.

2906
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:49,840
Suggestion, do not make another movie.

2907
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:51,800
Thank you.

2908
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:54,640
You need to get a Twitter account just to tweet that to her.

2909
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:56,320
I liked the last ones, honestly.

2910
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:58,720
I haven't seen the very last one, but I want to.

2911
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,840
Yeah, I didn't mind the first three movies.

2912
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:05,440
The third one was kind of, but this one was just pretty horrible.

2913
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:10,040
Speaking of Resident Evil movies, there's going to be another CG Resident Evil movie

2914
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:12,720
called Damnation.

2915
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:19,120
It's going to be released in Japan in 2012 and I guess it's 3D.

2916
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:24,880
Z-Generation has shipped over 1.6 million copies for home viewing and it only had a

2917
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:29,840
very limited release in Japan in the theaters and it grossed about $480,000 which is really

2918
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:30,840
good.

2919
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,400
40 million yen if you want to be technical.

2920
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:36,900
So there you go, another CG Resident Evil movie coming called Damnation and that's probably

2921
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:41,400
what Irene is going to say again if she has to see it in 3D.

2922
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:42,400
Pretty much.

2923
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:44,360
Are we ready to get to the mailbag?

2924
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:45,560
Let's do it, Rob.

2925
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:50,160
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelauntraded.com is the place to send

2926
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,160
them to.

2927
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:55,760
We open up the mailbag and find a few of our favorites and read them live on air and Dark

2928
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:57,760
Soccer will make fun of your grammar.

2929
02:16:57,760 --> 02:16:59,520
Yes I will.

2930
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:02,480
Okay, this comes from Rini.

2931
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:04,280
Hi Rini!

2932
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,280
Greetings O.L.R.

2933
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,260
On episode 8, I'm sorry 381, you lamented over Guitar Hero Warrior of Rock's ability

2934
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:12,520
to post accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook.

2935
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:13,520
We did?

2936
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:14,520
Oh.

2937
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:18,840
I didn't mention Rock Band 3 also has media integration features, but they have a bit

2938
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:19,840
of use.

2939
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:23,400
For example, you can make a setlist and post it for friends to see or try out.

2940
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:26,120
Of course you can throttle the frequency of posts.

2941
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:30,980
Another concern with Rock Band 3 is promo DLC, which is going to be separate from standard

2942
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:32,080
DLC.

2943
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:35,160
Just to clarify, this pro DLC is only for guitar and bass.

2944
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:38,160
Pro keys and drums are included in the normal DLC.

2945
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:43,240
There's a lot more interesting details I could just gloss over, but rather than tired poor

2946
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:47,320
Dark Soccer's windpipes, I'll just link you guys to a few sources to skim over interesting

2947
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:52,000
details if you want to bring up such as harmonics, making older DLC compatible with keys in pro

2948
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
mode.

2949
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
So yeah, different stuff.

2950
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,520
All stuff coming out of packs.

2951
02:17:55,520 --> 02:18:00,760
I am really excited, I actually did not pick up on the fact that pro keys was going to

2952
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:01,760
be just included.

2953
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:03,760
That actually makes me really happy.

2954
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:05,760
I'm smiling.

2955
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:10,000
You just can't see it because it's radio, but I'm smiling.

2956
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,840
Next email, Hey Orange Dones Radio, Haseo Sumi-Ragawa, here for the third time in this

2957
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:14,840
Lovely Marathon episode.

2958
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:15,840
So this was, yeah, last week.

2959
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:17,360
This must be an old one.

2960
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:21,520
Okay, in an earlier episode I asked about a problem with downloading Bleach Heat The

2961
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:22,800
Soul 6.

2962
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:25,720
And you guys said be more detailed, so here it is.

2963
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:28,560
Okay, Bleach Heat The Soul 6 is a PSP game.

2964
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:31,360
I downloaded it and it was a RAR file.

2965
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:36,240
Oh, you downloaded a fake.

2966
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:41,880
Can't help him with that unless he gets into something a little more legitimate.

2967
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:46,480
I don't want to pay the extra cost of importing at $60, which is a bit ridiculous considering

2968
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:50,640
the extra $20 for next day shipping so they can kiss my butt on that front.

2969
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:51,640
Actually...

2970
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:55,440
You can buy, by the way, import PSP games at Fry's.

2971
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:59,520
I actually, I'm going to take shit for this, but I don't care.

2972
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,520
I've said it on the show before.

2973
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:03,880
I'm not opposed to pirating importing games, imported games actually.

2974
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:07,760
Because I think if they are not going to take a chance and release it over here, then why

2975
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:12,380
should we pay all this money in import fees to when they're not counting on us for their

2976
02:19:12,380 --> 02:19:13,380
success anyway?

2977
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:14,380
You know what I mean?

2978
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:19,960
Like, I know that's going to be frowned upon by some people, but I really don't pirate

2979
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:24,080
games here in the US, but the import ones, yeah, I have.

2980
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,560
Thanks for reading my email, loyal listener Samir Agala.

2981
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:32,440
PS, people are wondering, I got the name from Haseo from.hack//G.U. series.

2982
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:36,080
Samir Agala from the ReadOrDieTV anime, yes, I know it's a woman's last name, it doesn't

2983
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:39,800
really matter whose last name it is, but F you to all who have a problem with that.

2984
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:40,800
Thanks again.

2985
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:46,520
Also, if you can't help me via the radio, please do send a reply.

2986
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,520
Forward it to Loki.

2987
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:51,520
Loki can trick the mailbox.

2988
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:58,000
Okay, now, okay, this is from Robboy, from Robaba.

2989
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,800
Now wait a minute, with all the halos and modern, no, more violence drops impossible.

2990
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:03,600
Okay, that's what it's called.

2991
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:07,200
Now wait a minute, with all the halos and modern warfares, crimes should be way up according

2992
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,720
to the whack job anti-game protesters, right?

2993
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:12,480
Not so in, and there's an article from Bennington Banner.

2994
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:16,680
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report Monday on crime statistics for 2009

2995
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:23,880
that showed a 5.3% drop in violent crimes nationwide and a 4.6% drop in property crimes.

2996
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:28,280
I'll be honest that they didn't define the drop context, whether it's per capita or total

2997
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:32,840
crimes, but all of these violent games poisoning our minds should turn us into gun-toting cold-blooded

2998
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:33,840
killers.

2999
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:37,560
I personally believe that not just games, but media and software use in general may

3000
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:40,760
be indirectly causing the drop.

3001
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:45,600
Watching TV, playing games, browsing the intertubes, texting on our phones, and other sedentary

3002
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,160
activities are keeping us inside.

3003
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:51,760
Not just that, and here's where I get a little controversial, I believe that violence is

3004
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:55,600
inversely correlated with average weight.

3005
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:59,920
Think about it, the more you are overweight, the less mayhem you'll be willing to do.

3006
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:04,880
Fat equals peace, maybe that's stretching it, or discrimination right there, or stretch

3007
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:09,560
pantsing it.

3008
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:13,720
Everyone slowly step away from Rob.

3009
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:18,160
I'm trying to think if I've ever seen on the news, like somebody who committed a really

3010
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:23,760
horrible crime and if they were fat, like I'm, I'm sure there's been a few fatties.

3011
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,160
There's been.

3012
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:27,160
You're the you in your plan.

3013
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:29,360
The guy who shot John Lennon was pretty fat, if I remember right, so.

3014
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,360
Oh yeah.

3015
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:32,280
And that was a really recent story too, so.

3016
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:35,400
And I was commenting on the fact that you're like seven pounds, Rob, I wasn't saying you're

3017
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:36,400
fat, it was the opposite.

3018
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:37,400
Slim Jim over here.

3019
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:38,400
It's from Rob-a-ba.

3020
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:41,160
Anyway, next email.

3021
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:44,400
Okay, this is from somebody.

3022
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:49,160
Hey guys, I've been listening to this show for a year now, my first episode being the

3023
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:50,160
fuck show.

3024
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:53,680
Anyways, I have something word to share with you.

3025
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:59,480
The very day after you guys had Omen in the Cage match, DJ Hero posted a clip of it on

3026
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:00,480
YouTube.

3027
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:01,480
Coincidence?

3028
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:02,880
I think not, XD.

3029
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:05,880
But one more thing.

3030
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:10,040
Is that song you use at the end of the show every weekend behind the but we're probably

3031
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:11,040
right anyway message?

3032
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:12,680
I can't find it anywhere, thanks.

3033
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:14,200
That's just the closing time midi.

3034
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:16,160
It's an 8-bit remix of closing time.

3035
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:19,140
There was some website, I don't even know where it came from because it was actually

3036
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:22,280
sent to me by a friend and I was like, hey, we'll make that the closing theme of our show.

3037
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:23,760
And this is from Andy.

3038
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:28,300
I believe some website did like a compilation of a bunch of 8-bit versions of songs.

3039
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:29,960
You could probably find it on YouTube.

3040
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:33,720
Just Google like YouTube 8-bit closing time, you'll find it.

3041
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:34,720
But that's it.

3042
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:35,720
And what was it?

3043
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:36,720
There was another part of the question?

3044
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,720
No.

3045
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:38,720
Oh.

3046
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:39,720
No.

3047
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:40,720
Well, I made it through the whole marathon podcast.

3048
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:41,720
Thanks for all the effort.

3049
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:44,200
And as I think would be appropriate, here's the marathon email.

3050
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:47,680
It's shorter than 11 hours though, so you can stop grimacing, you misspelled my name

3051
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:48,680
dude.

3052
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:50,420
I'm looking at you.

3053
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:53,860
First of all, just to raise the bar, I thought I'd let you know that this week we're getting

3054
02:22:53,860 --> 02:22:56,580
a five, yes, five-day weekend in Mexico.

3055
02:22:56,580 --> 02:23:01,440
Since we're deep in bicentennial celebration, high five, act deaf, viva Mexico.

3056
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:06,040
My best geek moment was definitely when both of my kids, six and eight, actually requested

3057
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:08,320
I run a D&D campaign for them.

3058
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:11,240
Now we're playing the Diceless Marvel RPG.

3059
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:15,300
As for anger management moments, my one real fight with my mom was when I was growing up.

3060
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:19,340
At 14, she came into my room and just turned off my SNES because she thought I had had

3061
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,600
enough video games for the day.

3062
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:23,780
Well, I thought differently and actually took her by the shoulders and proceeded to gently

3063
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:27,840
but firmly explain as I took her out of my room, locked the door and turned my console

3064
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:28,960
back on again.

3065
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:31,280
She never bothered me with time limits after that.

3066
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,280
Wow.

3067
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:33,280
Wow.

3068
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:38,320
Finally, I've done the math and considering my OLR cherry was popped somewhere in the

3069
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:39,320
to-go era.

3070
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:41,760
Is this guy skinny?

3071
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:42,760
Let me finish.

3072
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:43,760
All right.

3073
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:44,760
Episode number now forgotten.

3074
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:48,360
I'm not listed in the wiki, but it was the one where Rob came out of the closet for the

3075
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:49,720
audience.

3076
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:58,040
I've now listened to at least episode one.

3077
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:59,360
Not the gaydar Rob.

3078
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:04,420
Just actually saying it actually might have been a while because I think at the beginning

3079
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:09,000
of the show, I actually purposely didn't want to say anything because not that I was ashamed

3080
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
of it.

3081
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I'm certainly not, but it's just kind of one of those, like, I was like, it's not your

3082
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
business.

3083
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
It doesn't matter for a while.

3084
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,440
I had a change of heart and well to finish this email.

3085
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,440
Sorry.

3086
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:26,600
I've now listened to at least 245 episodes or if you prefer 621.5 hours, 2.5 hours a

3087
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:28,280
pop of OLR.

3088
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:30,640
That's over 25 days of entertainment from you.

3089
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:34,320
So I'll just go ahead and thank you for one of the best months of my life and call it

3090
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,440
even for the next few episodes.

3091
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:37,440
Okay.

3092
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:38,440
Gracias.

3093
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:39,440
Muchas gracias.

3094
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:43,080
Sincerely, Dr. Noir, AKA the other Mexican recruit.

3095
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:47,680
PS, this mail has been reviewed by two separate automated spelling and grammar sensors and

3096
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:51,560
proofread by two young goats, which were then sacrificed to the bard in order to keep the

3097
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:52,960
dark goddess appeased.

3098
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:57,280
For the record, my name is spelled J-A-M-I-E, but thank you for trying.

3099
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,320
You know, it's funny.

3100
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:01,120
And people in other countries get a bye.

3101
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:02,120
Yes.

3102
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:03,120
Yes they do.

3103
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,520
But I have to tell you this.

3104
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:11,320
My name was never, my first name was never misspelled until I moved to California.

3105
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:12,320
Interesting.

3106
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:16,480
I'm just saying, people in Alabama can spell my name right.

3107
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:20,120
Next email.

3108
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:22,040
And this is another one from Rababa.

3109
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:24,880
I got what I believe can only be a phishing scam.

3110
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:30,860
I get an email from spoofed Blizzard inviting me to a beta of the next WoW expansion.

3111
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:34,460
The link is probably to a fake WoW login server because it didn't actually start with a Blizzard

3112
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:36,200
or WoW address.

3113
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,160
Also I don't even have a WoW account which made it extra fishy.

3114
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:40,680
PSA complete.

3115
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:47,280
I also got to play Dark Sakura Sunday because I got nauseous playing TrackMania.

3116
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,280
Later Rababa.

3117
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:50,200
No, it sounds legit to me.

3118
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,560
Yeah, you know what's funny?

3119
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:53,920
I get emails all the time for Ion online.

3120
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:58,560
Like, you know, log in and get free gold for Ion online and I'm like, I don't even play

3121
02:25:58,560 --> 02:25:59,560
dude.

3122
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:01,960
It's like, I don't have an account but okay, I'm gonna go do it right now.

3123
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:05,000
By the way, I have to tell you what Tiara said.

3124
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,320
If you've got import problems, Rob Bill's bad for you son.

3125
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:09,920
He's got 99 problems but a pirate ain't one.

3126
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:13,560
Oh, a happy talk like a pirate day to you too.

3127
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:14,560
Arr.

3128
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:15,560
Arr.

3129
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:16,560
Arr.

3130
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:17,560
Arr.

3131
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:18,560
Arr.

3132
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:19,560
Arr.

3133
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:20,560
Arr.

3134
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,560
Uh, yeah.

3135
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:22,560
Derailed.

3136
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:23,560
Keelhaul.

3137
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:24,560
Next email.

3138
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:25,560
That's it.

3139
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:30,680
Oh, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

3140
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:32,320
The futures!

3141
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:43,720
But the present brings the angst and the FUs of the week.

3142
02:26:43,720 --> 02:27:04,480
Here is justice, here is punishment, here is the fog of the day.

3143
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:05,480
Darkstalker.

3144
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:06,480
Um, FU to, um, Algebra.

3145
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:07,480
Loki.

3146
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:08,480
Second back.

3147
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:09,480
Um, I'd say FU to, um, well actually I've got quite a few this week.

3148
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:12,680
Um, FU to Ford for making really shitty cars.

3149
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:19,200
I've had to replace, um, the, uh, thermostat housing on my car about three times now because

3150
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:24,800
it keeps breaking, because it's made of plastic, and because it gets cracks in it because it

3151
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:27,760
oxidizes and that sucks.

3152
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:29,720
And it's about $300 each time.

3153
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:35,680
So FU to that, um, FU to people that, while they're grocery shopping, aren't paying attention

3154
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:40,120
to where the hell they are and they're totally blocking the aisle, they have their cart on

3155
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:44,160
one side and they're just browsing, totally oblivious to the world on the other side,

3156
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:49,400
or they have, like, kids running around and stuff like that, you know, so FU to them.

3157
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:57,160
And people that like to, um, I guess participate in idle chit-chat in the grocery lines.

3158
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:58,160
Thank you.

3159
02:27:58,160 --> 02:28:03,760
Um, my FU of the week, I'm putting this in for Alan, goes to Del Taco.

3160
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:07,920
Um, no, I have a good reason, because we actually went over to the drive-thru to get him a quick

3161
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,600
lunch that he could take on the train with him.

3162
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:14,120
Yeah, we sat in the drive-thru for 35 minutes, uh, before we finally got our food and, uh,

3163
02:28:14,120 --> 02:28:16,160
he missed his train as a result.

3164
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:20,320
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to have him here an extra day, but, you know,

3165
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:24,880
he had things he wanted to do, so, kind of irritating when they take a very, very long

3166
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:25,880
time.

3167
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:27,040
What was their explanation?

3168
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,040
They didn't really have one.

3169
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:29,040
Huh.

3170
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:30,040
They were just busy.

3171
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:31,040
Ow.

3172
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,040
I know, right?

3173
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:37,040
So otherwise, FU to the fact that I have to get up at six in the morning tomorrow.

3174
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:38,040
Ugh.

3175
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:39,040
Wham.

3176
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,040
Sad.

3177
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:41,880
Do you have any FUs of the weak rice princess?

3178
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:47,480
Yeah, FU to everything 3D, and, uh, FU to stinky farts.

3179
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:48,480
Uh.

3180
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:49,480
Excuse me.

3181
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:51,480
That about covers it.

3182
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:52,480
The doctor?

3183
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:57,560
FU to 3D as well, because I hate 3D forever, pound it, explosion.

3184
02:28:57,560 --> 02:29:01,520
And also, FU to American TV for not having as many gay kisses as British TV.

3185
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:04,760
Bring on the gay kisses, American TV.

3186
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:06,480
I'll show you a gay kiss right now.

3187
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:09,320
Whoa, oh my god, they really kissed.

3188
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:11,840
They did it.

3189
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:14,840
Alan, they totally kissed.

3190
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,840
Alright.

3191
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:21,360
Couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username

3192
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:22,360
on Skype, orange launcher.

3193
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:23,840
I should probably boot Skype, huh?

3194
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,960
But not yet, because we still got two more stories to go.

3195
02:29:25,960 --> 02:29:32,280
Yes, who would have thought that D3 would announce that they're releasing Earth Defense

3196
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:35,040
Force Insect Armageddon.

3197
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:36,040
Really?

3198
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:38,840
On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

3199
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:46,400
Wow, that's wonderful news that I wish I knew earlier, but didn't know it until just now.

3200
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:49,080
And they did release a little teaser, which is pretty awesome.

3201
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:54,160
It's gonna be developed now by the people that did, and I don't know if this is a bad

3202
02:29:54,160 --> 02:30:01,600
thing or not, the people that did the EAT LED Return of Matt Hazard game.

3203
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:03,360
But the way I look at it, like this, okay?

3204
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:08,040
The original Earth Defense Force 2017 game was pretty crappy.

3205
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:13,980
When you look at all the development side of it, I mean, the game had no physics.

3206
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:18,120
The game was very laggy.

3207
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:19,420
It was just fun, though.

3208
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:20,460
And this game looks fun, too.

3209
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:23,160
It's supposed to take place now in New Detroit.

3210
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:28,420
The graphics are updated, and by the screenshot, looks like we get the jetpack from number

3211
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:30,660
two, which is pretty awesome.

3212
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:35,240
So I am very looking forward to this game, it's supposed to be coming out in February.

3213
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:37,400
SSG100Matt says, the game is doomed!

3214
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:39,520
And he actually says, doomed!

3215
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:41,160
It's gonna be awesome.

3216
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:42,360
I don't care.

3217
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:46,000
Well, I had no idea this game was gonna be coming out.

3218
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,680
And I'm really happy that no one seemed to care that Loki, you know...

3219
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:55,240
Loki is saying this for the very first time, I mean, on this program.

3220
02:30:55,240 --> 02:31:00,280
One more news story for you guys, and it has to do with a new world record in video games!

3221
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:01,280
Sweet!

3222
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:02,280
Sweet!

3223
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,000
And the winner is Mafia 2!

3224
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Yay!

3225
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,520
And what did Mafia 2 get?

3226
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:14,160
Well, Mafia 2 uses the word fuck more than any other video game!

3227
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:15,160
Yay!

3228
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:16,160
Yay!

3229
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:19,840
They won the award for most swearing in a video game.

3230
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:20,840
That's right.

3231
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:21,840
Fuck yeah.

3232
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:22,840
The fuck they did!

3233
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:28,640
Um, uh, House of the Dead Overkill was the previous title that had 189 uses of the word

3234
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:29,640
fuck.

3235
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:34,000
Like, well, you know, fuck, or fucking, or motherfucker, all of that.

3236
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:47,560
But now, apparently, um, Mafia 2 has more than 200 instances of fuck.

3237
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:48,560
What the fuck did you say?

3238
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,560
I couldn't hear.

3239
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,560
I was talking.

3240
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:52,640
Congratulations.

3241
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:58,640
I mean, you guys, that's just really immature, to say fuck as many times as possible in a

3242
02:31:58,640 --> 02:31:59,640
short period.

3243
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:00,640
That's really immature.

3244
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:01,640
Because we've never had a fuck show.

3245
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:02,640
No.

3246
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:03,640
No.

3247
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:04,640
No.

3248
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:05,640
That we would never stoop so loud.

3249
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,640
That would be fucking ridiculous.

3250
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:07,640
That would be extremely fucking immature.

3251
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:11,320
And we would never do anything like that because, you know, we're intelligent gamers.

3252
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:12,320
We're classy.

3253
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:13,320
We're classy.

3254
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:15,680
Stop saying fuck.

3255
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:17,360
Classy like the playboys that were in Mafia 2.

3256
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:20,080
Why don't you give us a call and we'll talk?

3257
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:24,440
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3258
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:26,640
We'll let Rice Princess answer all the calls tonight.

3259
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:27,640
Is that sounding fun?

3260
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:28,640
Can I answer the calls tonight?

3261
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:29,640
Yeah.

3262
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:30,640
Sure.

3263
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:31,640
I'm classy as fuck.

3264
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:32,640
All right.

3265
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:34,760
Rice Princess is going to answer all the calls for us tonight.

3266
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:41,400
So call and talk to Rice Princess at 1-877-GAME-OLR and she will talk to our listeners.

3267
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:44,080
And don't ask me anything stupid.

3268
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:46,000
I'll jump in and help if you need it.

3269
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Okay.

3270
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I'll answer the stupid questions.

3271
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Okay.

3272
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Just say, Rob, this is a stupid question.

3273
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Help me out.

3274
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,000
No, don't make the listeners feel bad.

3275
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,600
Can I just give you a signal like, Rob, this is a stupid question.

3276
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:56,600
Yeah, she can.

3277
02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:57,600
Okay.

3278
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,600
Here we go.

3279
02:32:58,600 --> 02:32:59,600
We got a call coming in.

3280
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:00,600
You ready?

3281
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:01,600
Yeah.

3282
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:02,600
Hi.

3283
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:03,600
You're on.

3284
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:04,600
OLR person.

3285
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:05,600
Hi.

3286
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:06,600
Select the Zaku right here.

3287
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,600
Hi.

3288
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:08,600
Yeah.

3289
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:09,600
I know.

3290
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:10,600
I thought Sky was going to be on, but.

3291
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:11,600
Oh, sorry.

3292
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:12,840
This is a stupid question, Rob.

3293
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:14,320
I guess you should take over.

3294
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:15,320
Zaku.

3295
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:21,600
Well, I did IMU within the chat and I have good reason to be here tonight.

3296
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:22,600
All right.

3297
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:23,600
What's your good reason?

3298
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:28,800
You know, I actually attended that Halo Reach launch party that Best Buy threw last week,

3299
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:29,800
you know, in the city.

3300
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:31,680
I actually got in as VIP.

3301
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:32,680
Ooh.

3302
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:33,680
Let's just say.

3303
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,120
How did you get in as VIP, fancy pants?

3304
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:39,760
Let's just say it's through the company I work for.

3305
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,440
And they actually do business for Best Buy.

3306
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:44,900
They actually build some of their apps for stuff like reward zones.

3307
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:46,920
So you had to give a reach around for reach?

3308
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:48,360
No, I actually got in.

3309
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,360
Okay.

3310
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:50,920
I actually got in through those connections.

3311
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:55,440
But yeah, pretty much it was just typical fanfare launch party with a lot of people

3312
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:57,400
trying to get in VIP.

3313
02:33:57,400 --> 02:34:02,240
But most of the folks, all it was is just like playing Halo Reach before midnight.

3314
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:03,280
Wait, wait, wait.

3315
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:05,000
What did the VIP people get?

3316
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
What made you?

3317
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,120
Well, I already know you're VIP because you listen to this show.

3318
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:15,080
But what did VIP get that the little peons waiting in line did not get?

3319
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:16,080
Did you get the strip bus?

3320
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:17,580
A full service bar.

3321
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:18,920
We had our own balcony section.

3322
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:19,920
Stuff like that.

3323
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:20,920
A full service bar.

3324
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:21,920
A full service bar.

3325
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:22,920
Yes, exactly.

3326
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:27,320
Yeah, we had a full bar.

3327
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:28,320
So how many people were there?

3328
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:31,200
What did they do that was, did they have like a rock concert?

3329
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:32,200
I don't know.

3330
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:33,200
What did they do?

3331
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:37,800
One person, I forgot his name, Kid Cutter or something, he was supposed to have played,

3332
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:41,440
but he didn't play exactly, you know, before midnight.

3333
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:45,360
But by the time, you know, we left after midnight, he actually got on stage.

3334
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:51,120
There's something about him just like being, you know, the unprofessional artist that he

3335
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:54,600
He opened for Lady Gaga once when I saw her and he's that guy.

3336
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:55,600
He just, day and night.

3337
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:56,600
That's him.

3338
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:57,600
Yeah.

3339
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,600
Something like that.

3340
02:34:58,600 --> 02:34:59,600
I don't care.

3341
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:00,600
Okay.

3342
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:03,600
He had the crack song in DJ Hero.

3343
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:04,600
Day and night.

3344
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:05,600
Okay.

3345
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:07,600
We heard you the first time, Rob.

3346
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:10,400
You sure you didn't do the song?

3347
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:15,940
It was just like, it was basically free, you know, free swag, free liquor, free food, playing

3348
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:17,200
Halo Reach.

3349
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:20,480
One of my friends manages, you know, managed to like win a couple of rounds.

3350
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:24,560
I still suck at, you know, at twitch shooters, on controllers.

3351
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:26,160
I can't do the sticks.

3352
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:30,720
So that's pretty much the highlight of that night and just getting drunk.

3353
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:31,720
Were there strippers?

3354
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:32,720
On a Monday night.

3355
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:34,720
Were there strippers?

3356
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:39,360
No, there weren't any strippers unless you count all the fanboys that were actually,

3357
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:47,200
you know, donning Halo, Halo, you know, clothing, such as the plasma swords and whatnot.

3358
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:49,840
How many women were in line for Halo Reach compared to men?

3359
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,720
There was a lot of people outside, actually.

3360
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,520
It was literally stretching around the block.

3361
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,520
He's dodging the quest.

3362
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:57,440
But they were, they were outside and not actually in the line waiting to buy the game, right?

3363
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:58,440
They were still inside, though.

3364
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:00,280
There was, there were people waiting to get in.

3365
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:01,280
That's the thing.

3366
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,280
Oh, okay.

3367
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:03,280
It was like a, you know,

3368
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:06,200
But you got to sit up on the balcony and just judge them all, right?

3369
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:07,880
Of course, because you know what?

3370
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:09,840
I had, you know, I was connected.

3371
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:14,760
As I said, I work for the company, our company does business with Best Buy, so they hooked

3372
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:15,920
us up.

3373
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:17,920
So I thank them for that.

3374
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:18,920
All right.

3375
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:24,840
But yeah, I mean, aside from that little escapade that I had, I want to talk about, you know,

3376
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:31,200
about the fact that, let me see, Konami basically, you know, started to think outside the box

3377
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:36,720
for a change in terms of like taking arcade concepts that God knows will not succeed in

3378
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:40,160
this nation and trying to take advantage of other platforms.

3379
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:42,360
Let me guess, you're talking about U-Beat?

3380
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:48,640
Yes, on the iPad, which makes a lot, a lot of sense, given the fact that it's touch-based

3381
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:50,680
and the platform is there.

3382
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:55,080
That means arcade owners, you know, as much as, you know, as much as I respect them, they

3383
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:59,620
won't have to shell out, you know, tons of money for something that may or may not succeed

3384
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:00,620
on that medium.

3385
02:37:00,620 --> 02:37:07,440
And it's a lot, in other words, you could catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

3386
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:08,440
That's good.

3387
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:12,480
I mean, it's a good, look, I'm more of an Android developer, but even though I have

3388
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:17,320
an iPod touch, I do respect the platform, but I don't like the way they, you know, I

3389
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:18,680
don't like Apple censoring.

3390
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:20,400
How much do you think they'll charge for U-Beat?

3391
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:21,400
99 cents?

3392
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:22,400
$4.99?

3393
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:24,440
I'm pretty certain it'll be $5 at most.

3394
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,440
You know what they'll do?

3395
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:28,520
I bet you it's like 99 cents and then like a dollar a song.

3396
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:29,520
Yes, exactly.

3397
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:30,800
They're doing DDRS.

3398
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:31,800
Gross.

3399
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:36,080
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but any other thoughts on

3400
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:37,080
the Halo Reach party?

3401
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:41,320
If you could sum up the Halo Reach launch party and your VIP access in one word, what

3402
02:37:41,320 --> 02:37:42,320
would it be?

3403
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:43,320
Sausage.

3404
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,320
Damn.

3405
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:48,120
Damn good time for free.

3406
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:49,360
That's too many words.

3407
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:50,360
Have a good night.

3408
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:51,360
Alright.

3409
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:52,360
Night.

3410
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:53,360
Alright.

3411
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:56,680
877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio if you'd like to give us

3412
02:37:56,680 --> 02:38:00,320
a call and tell us about your VIP treatment.

3413
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:01,320
And full service.

3414
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:02,320
Whoa.

3415
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:03,320
I know, right?

3416
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:04,320
Fancy schmancy.

3417
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,320
Fancy schmancy.

3418
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:06,320
Hi.

3419
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,320
You're on Orangelaunchradio.

3420
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:08,320
Who's this?

3421
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:09,320
It's Con.

3422
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:10,320
Hi, whatever you said.

3423
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:11,320
What's your question?

3424
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:27,840
I was wondering if you guys had heard about the Fable 3 book that's going to be published.

3425
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,840
Cool.

3426
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:29,840
Continue.

3427
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,840
No, he asked a question, dummy.

3428
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:32,840
Cool.

3429
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:33,840
Continue.

3430
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:34,840
The Fable 3 book.

3431
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:35,840
What about it?

3432
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:38,920
That's going to be, actually, I don't know much about this either.

3433
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:39,920
Tell us about it.

3434
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:41,640
Is it going to be a fantasy book?

3435
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:44,480
Yeah, it's actually not Fable 3.

3436
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:49,280
It's going to be taking place between Fable 2 and Fable 3.

3437
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:53,800
And when you purchase the book, it'll have a download code for a special weapon in the

3438
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:54,800
game.

3439
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:57,920
What's to stop me from going into Barnes and Noble and just copying the code from the book

3440
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:00,640
and running home and cashing it in before someone else can?

3441
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:01,640
Rude.

3442
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:05,120
Honestly, that was my thought as well.

3443
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:09,120
Maybe they have it in plastic wrap or something and you, I don't know, set off alarms.

3444
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,760
You'll set off an alarm if you break the seal.

3445
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:12,760
Exactly.

3446
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:15,280
The master chief comes down and blows your head off.

3447
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:16,280
Close range.

3448
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:17,280
Oh, God.

3449
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:18,280
Oh.

3450
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:21,040
Are you a big fan of Fable?

3451
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,560
I'm curious about this new game.

3452
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:23,560
I don't know.

3453
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:26,800
It didn't seem that different from 2 from what I played, but I heard they really improved

3454
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:27,800
co-op.

3455
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:31,720
I am really jealous that you did get to play it.

3456
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:34,560
Yeah, I am a pretty big Fable fan.

3457
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:41,360
I'll tell you, when I played it kind, I ran around in a giant chicken suit for like 10

3458
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:45,360
minutes and I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like I was playing Furries the

3459
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:46,360
game.

3460
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:49,040
It's because you were.

3461
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:52,560
That actually would be, you know, you like, look, like don't even lie listeners.

3462
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:56,560
You know, like if there were like a Furries the game, you'd have to check it out at least

3463
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:57,560
once.

3464
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:58,560
Like don't even judge.

3465
02:39:58,560 --> 02:39:59,560
Oh yeah.

3466
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:00,560
Just the one time.

3467
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:01,560
Just the one time.

3468
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:05,600
Try to project onto our listeners, okay, just because you want to do it.

3469
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,200
I think it would be funny.

3470
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:14,280
Yeah, funny and arousing.

3471
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:18,200
Do you think, do you think that there's enough Fable mythos out there and enough world that

3472
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:21,880
they've constructed out of the games that will make for pretty decent fantasy novels?

3473
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:25,040
Because, you know, it's not like novels for video games is anything too new.

3474
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:27,480
I mean, Warcraft has a bunch of them.

3475
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:28,800
Even Halo has novels.

3476
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:29,800
Resident Evil.

3477
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:30,800
Resident Evil.

3478
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:35,040
There's a lot of games, the FX9 novels back in the day, Castlevania, Blaster Master, heck

3479
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,040
yeah.

3480
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:38,280
Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

3481
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:42,240
Is there enough substance in Fable to lend itself to books well, you think?

3482
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:45,120
There should be.

3483
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:50,640
And besides, they have someone from, I think it was Wizards of the Coast, writing the novel,

3484
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:53,120
The Makers of Dungeons and Dragons.

3485
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:58,160
Oh, and now Irene likes Dungeons and Dragons, so maybe you should get, why don't you play

3486
02:40:58,160 --> 02:40:59,160
Fable?

3487
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:00,160
It's actually kind of neat.

3488
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,120
Because I'm too busy playing D&D.

3489
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:03,120
What a good answer.

3490
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:07,120
Well, you put me on the spot, okay, you asshole?

3491
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:09,120
That's what we do here on this show.

3492
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:13,520
Because it's expensive and not a lot of people have the money to turn off on a $60 game.

3493
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:15,200
Wait, what console is it for?

3494
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:17,400
It's for the Xbox 360, your favorite.

3495
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:18,400
There's your answer.

3496
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:19,400
Ding, ding, ding.

3497
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:22,160
It's not my fault you're poor.

3498
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,160
All right.

3499
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:24,160
It's not my fault you're an asshole.

3500
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:25,160
All right.

3501
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:26,160
And you smell.

3502
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,520
Let's see what else I want to ask Kaim.

3503
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:29,520
I don't know.

3504
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:32,640
Kaim, quickly, anything else you're looking forward to this holiday season?

3505
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:37,640
All right, Fallout, Grinch News Plus 5, Fable 3.

3506
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:45,240
Besides that, I'm not looking forward to anything until next year when Tell of Your Rising comes

3507
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:46,240
out.

3508
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:48,320
Ah, that is going to be a very popular game.

3509
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:51,080
So no interest in the motion control stuff.

3510
02:41:51,080 --> 02:41:54,440
No Kinect, no Move in your future?

3511
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:59,280
When they come out with the Kinect feature in Fable 3, where I'm able to growth the other

3512
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:00,280
player?

3513
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:01,280
Sure.

3514
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:02,280
All right.

3515
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:05,320
We'll leave it at that.

3516
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:06,320
Have a good one, Kaim.

3517
02:42:06,320 --> 02:42:08,040
Thanks so much for the call.

3518
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:09,040
We'll see you around.

3519
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:10,040
All right.

3520
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,040
You guys take it easy.

3521
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:12,040
Later.

3522
02:42:12,040 --> 02:42:13,040
You too.

3523
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:14,040
Bye bye.

3524
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:15,040
Bye.

3525
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:16,040
What's this private message you're sending me, DarkSakura?

3526
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:17,040
You have a microphone.

3527
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,040
You can just tell me.

3528
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:19,040
It's something that Tiara said.

3529
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:20,040
It's funny.

3530
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:21,040
You should read it.

3531
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:22,040
Also, there is Furries the game.

3532
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:23,680
It's called Worgen in the new WoW expansion.

3533
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:28,960
Actually, I was reading a really funny story on WoW.com about how apparently Worgens may

3534
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:31,960
not get a mount because Worgens will be the mount.

3535
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:32,960
We'll just run.

3536
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:33,960
Yeah.

3537
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:34,960
That's actually it.

3538
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:35,960
Worgens will be the mount.

3539
02:42:35,960 --> 02:42:36,960
Okay.

3540
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:42,080
Which, WoW nerd, the Tauren actually had an ability called Planes Runner in the early

3541
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:43,080
days of WoW.

3542
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:44,080
I remember that.

3543
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:45,080
That's right.

3544
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:48,200
Where they could actually be the mounts themselves, but they were patched in with Kodos in a later

3545
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:49,200
expansion.

3546
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:51,400
Aren't Jeweds kind of like that too?

3547
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:53,840
Like they can just have their own flying shit?

3548
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:54,840
Yes.

3549
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:55,840
Okay.

3550
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:56,840
How about another call?

3551
02:42:56,840 --> 02:42:57,840
You ready, Irene?

3552
02:42:57,840 --> 02:42:58,840
Yes.

3553
02:42:58,840 --> 02:42:59,840
Okay.

3554
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:00,840
Hi, Ryan.

3555
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:01,840
Oh, damn.

3556
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:02,840
What's up?

3557
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:03,840
Fuck you.

3558
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:05,080
I'm booting you from the guild.

3559
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,080
Shut up.

3560
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:07,080
Whatever.

3561
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:08,080
Whatever.

3562
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:09,080
I'll G kick you quicker than you could me.

3563
02:43:09,080 --> 02:43:10,080
Oh.

3564
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:11,080
In fact, look.

3565
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,080
I'm on the game right now.

3566
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:13,080
Okay.

3567
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:14,080
Hold on.

3568
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:15,080
Hold on.

3569
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:16,080
Hold on.

3570
02:43:16,080 --> 02:43:17,080
Radio 101.

3571
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:18,080
Real quick, Irene.

3572
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:19,080
Even though their name comes up on the screen, you're supposed to, for radio's sake, just

3573
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:21,360
play stupid and say, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

3574
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:22,360
Who is this?

3575
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:24,080
Even though you can clearly see his name is Ryan B.

3576
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:25,080
Whoa.

3577
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:26,080
Whoa.

3578
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:27,080
Whoa.

3579
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:28,080
It sounds weird on the radio.

3580
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:29,080
His name is Ryan B.

3581
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:30,080
What?

3582
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:31,080
Stop it.

3583
02:43:31,080 --> 02:43:32,080
What?

3584
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:33,720
You have a two-way personal information there.

3585
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:35,360
I'm not going to give away the whole thing.

3586
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:39,600
I didn't say the whole thing, but take it off your Skype info.

3587
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:40,600
Yeah.

3588
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,600
Sure.

3589
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:45,160
You can all see it in your studio.

3590
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:47,400
Because otherwise, you sound like Miss Cleo.

3591
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:48,400
Like-

3592
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:49,400
Go to me now.

3593
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:50,400
That's because I am Chad.

3594
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,400
I already know your name, Chad.

3595
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:52,400
How can I help you today, Ryan?

3596
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:56,960
And you're going to get booted out of the guild.

3597
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:59,840
Another reference that most of your listeners probably don't get, Rob.

3598
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:00,840
It's true.

3599
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:01,840
You're like, Miss Cleo, who?

3600
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:02,840
I know, right?

3601
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:03,840
Indeed.

3602
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:04,840
Anyway.

3603
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:05,840
Oh, sorry, Irene.

3604
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:06,840
Oh, yeah.

3605
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:07,840
What do you want, Ryan?

3606
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:08,840
You.

3607
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:09,840
Gasp.

3608
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:10,840
Trauma.

3609
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:15,200
Okay, so what do you really want, besides me, everyone?

3610
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:16,200
Me.

3611
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:18,720
Oh, that's the truth right there.

3612
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:19,720
All right, come on.

3613
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:20,720
No, really.

3614
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:21,720
What do you want?

3615
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:22,720
Oh, no.

3616
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:26,680
I was just calling in to see how excited you are about Civ V coming out this coming Tuesday.

3617
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:33,080
You know, I am not excited to spend $50 on a game I'll probably play twice, because the

3618
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:38,600
stupid wow and all the stupid time sink I spent on that game.

3619
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:39,600
But I love my guildies.

3620
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:43,560
Yeah, I see how much you've been spending time on my gift for you.

3621
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:44,560
Well, right?

3622
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:47,600
Like, I don't- Do you know how much I played StarCraft II?

3623
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:48,600
Not enough.

3624
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:49,600
No, I understand that completely.

3625
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,600
Not enough.

3626
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:53,480
Very time consuming, especially with everything coming out now for it.

3627
02:44:53,480 --> 02:45:01,040
The bummer with starting a late raiding schedule, like our guild did, is that now we don't have

3628
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:05,520
that little- Usually, raiding kind of comes in cycles, and the content first comes out,

3629
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:09,040
you raid it a million times, and then it kind of dies off, and that's your time to go play

3630
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:10,040
other games.

3631
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:11,040
We haven't had that.

3632
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:12,040
Yeah.

3633
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:15,360
So, if I want to go play other games- Like, you know what the word late and raid

3634
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:16,680
is all in the same sentence.

3635
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:21,560
I mean, you guys, what, eight o'clock your time, by the time I get out of it, it's about

3636
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:23,640
3.30 in the morning for me.

3637
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:25,600
Not my fault you joined the West Coast Guild.

3638
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:26,600
All right.

3639
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:27,600
Mm-hmm.

3640
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:32,320
Anyway, for the listeners that don't play WoW, is there anything else on your mind tonight?

3641
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:37,520
No, the whole- The good old gaming GOG, that's a whole rouge.

3642
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:41,360
We figured that out come by Wednesday when they announced that they're actually taking

3643
02:45:41,360 --> 02:45:43,400
their stuff out of beta and actually going live.

3644
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:48,720
There has been reports now that's claiming that it has been all been one big rouge, and

3645
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:52,240
now they're probably going to pay dearly for what they did to all their paying customers,

3646
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:53,240
so- Are they dicks or are they dicks?

3647
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:56,800
I hope they have something in store for them, because a lot of people are going to still

3648
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:59,400
be upset by all that, so.

3649
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:00,400
Are you going to be upset?

3650
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:03,240
Are you going to boycott their website, and I'm never shopping here again.

3651
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:04,240
No, not really.

3652
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:06,320
I never bought anything from them in the first place.

3653
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:08,320
I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

3654
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:10,960
I bet you, like, half of- I mean, a lot of the games that they have,

3655
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,960
I already have.

3656
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:16,640
So, I mean, like, the Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, all the old games, I'll buy

3657
02:46:16,640 --> 02:46:19,800
Jerky anyway, so I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

3658
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:20,800
Alright.

3659
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:22,080
But, you know, people are going to.

3660
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,080
People are going to be like that.

3661
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:24,680
People are going to be like, why did you pull this on us?

3662
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:25,680
We thought you were being real.

3663
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:31,200
A lot of people didn't know what was really going on, and now you do this, and it's like,

3664
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,200
well, you know, screw you.

3665
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:36,960
I'll find another place to buy the game or torrent or whatever, so.

3666
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:42,760
Tigerclaw in chat says, I'm, I'm, I think he, oh, I'm really curious to hear how Rob

3667
02:46:42,760 --> 02:46:44,920
sounds like while playing WoW.

3668
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:46,000
I mean, how he acts.

3669
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,680
I hope it's not like that, a Nixxie, a white guy.

3670
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:53,280
How do I sound playing WoW, Ryan, since you've been on Ventrilo with me playing World of

3671
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:54,280
Warcraft?

3672
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:55,280
Day.

3673
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:56,280
Alright.

3674
02:46:56,280 --> 02:46:57,280
No, I'm kidding.

3675
02:46:57,280 --> 02:46:58,280
I'm kidding.

3676
02:46:58,280 --> 02:46:59,280
No, you sound like you do now.

3677
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:00,280
No.

3678
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:02,280
It's, it's like we pretty much, you know, it's, it's normal.

3679
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:05,160
I mean, nobody gets really too, you know, crazy in there.

3680
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:08,280
And I like to do, I like to do my wacky DJ voice for, you know, the, the writers.

3681
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:10,120
No, you do not do your wacky DJ voice.

3682
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:11,120
Hey, everybody!

3683
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:13,120
Let's go to the Summoning Stone!

3684
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:14,120
Alright!

3685
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:19,200
Let's go over to Tasslehop for the traffic.

3686
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:20,200
Alright.

3687
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:24,440
Which is the best name ever, because Dragonlance is awesome.

3688
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:25,440
I didn't even do that.

3689
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:26,920
I didn't even try, I didn't even pretend to come back from that.

3690
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,920
I couldn't do that.

3691
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:28,920
Watch.

3692
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:29,920
I, but I couldn't.

3693
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:31,280
Wednesday, I'm going to do that, you know?

3694
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:33,320
Alright, you guys, it's eight o'clock.

3695
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:35,120
Let's all get to the Stone.

3696
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,920
We're going to get some Leap Purples tonight.

3697
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:39,360
Tonight, we're going to get past the Blood Queen.

3698
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:40,360
Right after this.

3699
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:41,360
No, you're not.

3700
02:47:41,360 --> 02:47:42,360
Alright.

3701
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:43,360
I'm hanging up on you.

3702
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:44,360
Alright, you too.

3703
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:45,360
Bye.

3704
02:47:45,360 --> 02:47:46,360
Bye.

3705
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:47,360
Bye.

3706
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:48,360
I love wow calls.

3707
02:47:48,360 --> 02:47:49,360
Me too.

3708
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:52,320
Because there's not enough wow chat on this show that I want to start a whole other wow

3709
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:54,480
show, because there's not enough of them.

3710
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:58,880
SSJ, I hope, I hope there's people out there that would listen to a Robin X to her wow

3711
02:47:58,880 --> 02:47:59,880
show.

3712
02:47:59,880 --> 02:48:00,880
I might.

3713
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:01,880
I don't know.

3714
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:02,880
At least we'd have half a listener.

3715
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:03,880
Aren't I confident?

3716
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:04,880
Yes.

3717
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:05,880
Alright, let's see.

3718
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:13,400
SSJ 100 Matt says, you should celebrate this call by having a cupcake.

3719
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:16,800
That's a total inside joke.

3720
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:17,800
That's very rude.

3721
02:48:17,800 --> 02:48:18,800
That's brilliant.

3722
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:19,800
That's very rude.

3723
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:20,800
You ready for another call?

3724
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:21,800
Yes.

3725
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:22,800
Alright.

3726
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:25,560
Hi, you've reached Orange Slut Radio.

3727
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:26,560
Who is this?

3728
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:29,560
Hi, this is Nancy Neater.

3729
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:30,560
Hi.

3730
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:31,560
What's up?

3731
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:40,840
Hey, well, I just want to pass along a little tidbit, a bit of information to whatever listeners

3732
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:44,720
there are out there that's not in chat.

3733
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:53,160
Basically, there's an anime show that I just discovered called Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.

3734
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:54,160
Just now?

3735
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:55,160
It's a...

3736
02:48:55,160 --> 02:49:00,560
Hey, I just discovered Hoarders, and that's been on for like a year and a half, and I'm

3737
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:02,600
just finding out about it, so you know what?

3738
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:03,600
Back off.

3739
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:04,600
Judging you.

3740
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,600
Sorry, continue.

3741
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:06,600
Sorry.

3742
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:15,640
Basically, I just discovered Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood myself, and it's basically like

3743
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:25,080
a remake of an earlier show with the same name, and it's pretty damn good.

3744
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:34,760
In fact, I have no idea if it's on DVD or Blu-Ray or anything like that, but I happen

3745
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:41,920
to know that it is available for digital download.

3746
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:49,560
If you want to risk going that route, again, I was complaining about digital download before,

3747
02:49:49,560 --> 02:50:03,960
but at least right now, the first 13 episodes are actually on sale on PSN for 99 cents each.

3748
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:12,840
It's cheap, but at the same time, if you guys have listened to my calls a few months ago,

3749
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:22,600
it's kind of a risk with digital download, so if you want to take the risk, go for it,

3750
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:26,280
or if you want to save some money, go ahead.

3751
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:32,680
You don't think it's worth the risk, then look for a physical copy.

3752
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:37,240
So all together to get the whole series, it's like 14 bucks basically, what, 13 episodes

3753
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:40,280
99 cents a pop?

3754
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:47,080
Really it's only the first half of the series that's on sale.

3755
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:48,080
I think there's like 25-

3756
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:50,000
Aha, that's how they get you.

3757
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:53,280
They sucker you in to buy the first half, and then they're like, oh, but the second

3758
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:56,960
half is double the price.

3759
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:57,960
Exactly like that, Rob.

3760
02:50:57,960 --> 02:51:02,600
That's what they do at Sony headquarters.

3761
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:09,240
The weird thing is though, I'm not totally sure how Microsoft does their video marketplace.

3762
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:15,600
I really haven't used it yet, but I know at least over on PSN, a lot of times they'll

3763
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:23,920
have weekly sales on certain things, whatever's half off for that week, and a lot of times

3764
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:33,520
they even give away pilots to shows for free, and the whole thing, hey, this pilot that

3765
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:40,320
I got for free is good, might as well buy the rest of the series.

3766
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:51,680
But like I said, being here at risk if your system fucks up, there's a chance that unless

3767
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:56,000
you play your cards right, you could lose out on the content that you bought.

3768
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,760
And you have to demand to speak to a supervisor, correct, based on what I learned in your previous

3769
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:03,800
calls about Sony trauma.

3770
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:14,960
Yeah, luckily, at least in the situations I've been in, I managed to work it out, but

3771
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:20,160
like I said earlier in the call, weigh out the pros and cons.

3772
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:23,240
I have a solution to all of your Microsoft problems, by the way.

3773
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:24,760
This is Sony problems, though.

3774
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:26,760
Sony problems, whatever.

3775
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:28,400
Hook up a computer to your TV.

3776
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:29,400
Seriously.

3777
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:31,200
No more problem.

3778
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:32,200
It works for us.

3779
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:35,560
Okay, can I ask you a question?

3780
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:37,040
Not to completely derail what you were saying.

3781
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:39,040
Where are you from?

3782
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:40,040
Buffalo, New York.

3783
02:52:40,040 --> 02:52:41,040
Okay.

3784
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:44,040
I was trying to place your accent.

3785
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:52,360
Yeah, the weird thing is, my accent is not typical, though, because to get a little personal,

3786
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:54,240
I'm half Canadian.

3787
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:58,680
Everyone on my mother's side of the family is Canadian, and I spend a lot of time around

3788
02:52:58,680 --> 02:52:59,680
my Canadian relatives.

3789
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:02,440
We don't like Canadians in these parts.

3790
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:10,800
Yeah, so my accent is a blend of the bothalonian accent and the Canadian accent.

3791
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:16,320
That's very cool, because I was actually thinking Great Lakes area, but that's actually kind

3792
02:53:16,320 --> 02:53:17,320
of close.

3793
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:20,520
I don't want no damn Tim Hortons in my backyard.

3794
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:25,760
I'm sorry to completely derail what you said, but I've been trying to place it for several

3795
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:26,760
calls now.

3796
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:29,720
I'm going to say goodbye to Spaznator for now, because we get to go wrap up.

3797
02:53:29,720 --> 02:53:34,320
But Spaznator, thank you for the deal alert, and let's hope your PlayStation doesn't break

3798
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:35,320
again.

3799
02:53:35,320 --> 02:53:36,320
Sure.

3800
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:37,320
Have a good one.

3801
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:38,320
You too.

3802
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:39,320
Thanks.

3803
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:40,520
So you go into our chat room with some comments.

3804
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:44,120
Derek H says, there's this anime called Robotech that I just found out about.

3805
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:46,120
It's pretty good and deserves to be popular.

3806
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:47,120
Aw, rude.

3807
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:48,120
Aw.

3808
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:49,120
That's awful.

3809
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,120
Awfully funny.

3810
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:51,120
Meanie.

3811
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:54,640
No, he continues, whoa, did you guys know that they made a cartoon based on that Speed

3812
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:55,640
Racer movie?

3813
02:53:55,640 --> 02:53:56,920
I just discovered it.

3814
02:53:56,920 --> 02:53:57,920
That one made me a little for real.

3815
02:53:57,920 --> 02:54:03,560
Did you know that there was this cartoon they made about a little boy called Adam Boy?

3816
02:54:03,560 --> 02:54:08,400
Did you know that there's actually an old Battlestar Galactica that they did back in

3817
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:09,400
the 70s?

3818
02:54:09,400 --> 02:54:10,400
Uh-uh.

3819
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:11,540
And Starbucks, a dude?

3820
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:12,540
You know what?

3821
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:14,360
I've never seen any of the new episodes, only the old ones.

3822
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:15,800
Oh, the new ones are actually really good.

3823
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:16,800
They're super good.

3824
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:17,800
I ain't lying.

3825
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:18,800
Starbucks cannot be a chick.

3826
02:54:18,800 --> 02:54:19,800
And I love this.

3827
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:20,800
It's a coffee.

3828
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:26,400
Wait, this was my favorite comment during that whole call when Irene answered the call.

3829
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:29,360
Yzom says, orange slut radio discusses anime.

3830
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:31,920
Are you sure this is an orange virgin radio?

3831
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:36,600
No, it's orange anti-radio, orange tentacle rape radio.

3832
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:38,600
No, trust me, it's not.

3833
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:40,080
All right.

3834
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:43,040
R stands for rape.

3835
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:45,040
Wow.

3836
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:50,440
What is wrong with you?

3837
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:51,600
This show has just come to a switch call.

3838
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,800
That's horribly inappropriate.

3839
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:55,480
I was talking about tentacles.

3840
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:56,480
All right.

3841
02:54:56,480 --> 02:54:59,560
I really apologize to those callers that didn't get through tonight, but we've got to go and

3842
02:54:59,560 --> 02:55:00,800
wrap things up.

3843
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:02,280
And yeah, we're done.

3844
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:03,280
We're out of here for the night.

3845
02:55:03,280 --> 02:55:04,280
It's nine o'clock.

3846
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:05,280
I got homework to do.

3847
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:06,280
That's right.

3848
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:09,120
So thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to Orange Laundry Radio.

3849
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:10,960
We really appreciate it, you guys.

3850
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:14,520
Of course, if you're listening on the podcast and you want to join us live sometime, please

3851
02:55:14,520 --> 02:55:15,520
do.

3852
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:16,520
Sunday nights at All Games Radio.

3853
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:19,120
Just a heads up though, I'm going to be gone in two weeks.

3854
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:23,480
And I don't know if you really guys are doing, we're going to have a special, a special co-host

3855
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:24,480
via Skype.

3856
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:25,480
Oh, okay.

3857
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:28,480
I'm very curious to see how that show turns out.

3858
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:32,840
So make sure next week we show you how to click the buttons to go live and all that.

3859
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:33,840
Okay.

3860
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:34,840
You know how to do that.

3861
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:35,840
All right.

3862
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:36,840
Okay.

3863
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:37,840
I won't be here in two weeks.

3864
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:40,200
Mr. I didn't send anybody the iTunes information, so we had to figure it out for ourselves.

3865
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:41,200
Oh, I forgot.

3866
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:42,200
You don't know how I figured it out.

3867
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:43,200
It's okay.

3868
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:44,200
We figured it out.

3869
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:45,200
See, you're empowered women.

3870
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:46,200
You don't need no man's help.

3871
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:47,200
I didn't do it.

3872
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:48,200
Someone else did it.

3873
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:51,240
So, uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop for

3874
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:52,240
the night.

3875
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:57,520
Uh, first off rice princess, thank you very much for being here tonight and please come

3876
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:58,520
back.

3877
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:59,520
Okay.

3878
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:00,520
The listeners.

3879
02:56:00,520 --> 02:56:01,520
Love you.

3880
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:02,520
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

3881
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:03,520
I hate you all.

3882
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:04,520
Fuck you.

3883
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:05,520
I'm just kidding.

3884
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:07,520
No, I really like you guys.

3885
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:08,520
You're cool.

3886
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:09,520
All right.

3887
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:10,520
Cool.

3888
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:11,520
Ryan.

3889
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:12,520
I'm kicking you from the Guild.

3890
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:13,520
All right.

3891
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:18,320
Ryan is here and give him the damn mic.

3892
02:56:18,320 --> 02:56:19,320
Race princess.

3893
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:20,320
Oh, I'm the doctor.

3894
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:21,320
How's it going?

3895
02:56:21,320 --> 02:56:22,320
Rob?

3896
02:56:22,320 --> 02:56:23,320
Will you give him the microphone?

3897
02:56:23,320 --> 02:56:24,320
This is the doctor.

3898
02:56:24,320 --> 02:56:25,320
What you talking about?

3899
02:56:25,320 --> 02:56:33,760
Did you see the latest advertisement about, you know, things and thank you so much for

3900
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:34,760
being here tonight.

3901
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:36,960
No, that's exactly how I sound.

3902
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:38,960
She got it very good.

3903
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:39,960
Indeed.

3904
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:40,960
See, I told you.

3905
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:41,960
Hey.

3906
02:56:41,960 --> 02:56:50,640
What's the matter Rob?

3907
02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:51,640
Dark Sakura.

3908
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:53,120
You have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

3909
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:54,840
I hate algebra.

3910
02:56:54,840 --> 02:56:55,840
Me too.

3911
02:56:55,840 --> 02:56:56,840
Loki.

3912
02:56:56,840 --> 02:56:57,840
Do you have a final thought tonight?

3913
02:56:57,840 --> 02:56:58,840
I have to charge my devices.

3914
02:56:58,840 --> 02:57:00,320
They're all dead now.

3915
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:01,480
Jerks.

3916
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:05,020
My final thought is I have to charge my life.

3917
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:06,360
It's dead now.

3918
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:07,360
That was deeper.

3919
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:08,360
I know, right?

3920
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:09,360
Okay.

3921
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:10,360
Thank you guys so much for listening.

3922
02:57:10,360 --> 02:57:11,360
We really appreciate it.

3923
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:12,360
Thank you for your support.

3924
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:15,920
If you like what you heard, all we ask, tell two people about the show.

3925
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,400
Help us spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.

3926
02:57:17,400 --> 02:57:21,060
If you don't have any friends, which I highly doubt, but you can always also leave us nice

3927
02:57:21,060 --> 02:57:22,060
reviews on iTunes.

3928
02:57:22,060 --> 02:57:23,240
We appreciate that.

3929
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:28,400
Or any other, you know, place that discusses podcasts, you know, by what, podcast alley

3930
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:29,400
or whatever.

3931
02:57:29,400 --> 02:57:33,280
Just any place where they're discussing podcasts, say a good word or two and help us spread

3932
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:35,040
the word about Orange Launch Radio.

3933
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:39,120
If you didn't like what you heard here, then fine, but support independent radio.

3934
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:42,320
There's a lot of other great shows at All Games Radio that run throughout the week and

3935
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:43,320
just, you know, go to iTunes.

3936
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:48,320
There's like 50 billion podcasts out there, but try to download one that actually gets

3937
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:52,560
updated once a week or at least once a month because, you know, iTunes has some things

3938
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:55,240
that have been molding since 2007 still on the store.

3939
02:57:55,240 --> 02:57:57,120
So, you know, just good luck with that.

3940
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:58,120
Yeah.

3941
02:57:58,120 --> 02:57:59,120
Anyhow, thanks again.

3942
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:00,640
Have a wonderful night.

3943
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:01,640
We'll see you next week.

3944
02:58:01,640 --> 02:58:04,640
We're going to do this all over again with more of Orange Launch Radio.

3945
02:58:04,640 --> 02:58:11,640
Until then, good night.

3946
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:36,440
See you next week.
