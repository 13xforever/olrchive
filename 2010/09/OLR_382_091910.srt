00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:26,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight, September 19th, 2010, a much-hyped MMO shuts down after only three months, Konami and Harmonix settle their Rock Band lawsuit, and the Nielsen Report rates the effectiveness of ads in video games.

2
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:36,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:39,657
[SPEAKER_10]: We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:48,299
[SPEAKER_10]: We meet live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

5
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Except tonight, actually we didn't meet after the Bobby Blackwolf show because he's on vacation.

6
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,161
[SPEAKER_10]: How dare he?

7
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours.

8
00:00:56,782 --> 00:01:00,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to my awesome co-hosts, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Buh.

10
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,269
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, my friend?

11
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:04,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Buh.

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,871
[SPEAKER_10]: That good, huh?

13
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing fantastic, Rob.

14
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to hear it.

15
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:09,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are you today?

16
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:10,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Super.

17
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:11,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for asking.

18
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:12,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

19
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:13,415
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

20
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:17,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Also joining us, as he does every week, say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:18,858
[SPEAKER_10]: That last fry didn't taste good.

22
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:26,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to hear that, but I heard you exclaim, literally as the opening credits are rolling on our show, I hear Loki go, ooh, bonus onion ring.

23
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

24
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty busy week in gaming thanks to the Tokyo Game Show.

25
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:55,485
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of news and stuff going on here in the States as well.

26
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like so much to talk about tonight.

27
00:01:58,146 --> 00:02:03,690
[SPEAKER_10]: We supposedly have some guests coming, but I got a text that they're running late, of course, because these people always run late.

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Shh, don't tell them.

29
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,953
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm assuming they'll be here any moment, so we'll introduce them whenever they show up.

30
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:15,958
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably won't come into the studio quietly, so I apologize in advance for any derailment that is bound to happen on this lovely radio program.

31
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:18,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay, I dressed up.

32
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk, yes you did, you went all out today.

33
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:23,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, she's wearing her pajamas just so you guys know.

34
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:28,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's start it off with how was your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week.

35
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:34,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know DarkSakura finally jumped into something because I got a text message earlier this week that let me know she did.

36
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,156
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's up DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

37
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:42,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I started Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they transformed into special people.

38
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:45,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's as far as I am right now.

39
00:02:47,743 --> 00:03:00,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm playing The Sims 3 right now because Dan got me Ambitions And Dan's home from his trip and I'm so happy And that's it So Final Fantasy XIII, what do you think of the battle system?

40
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:01,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of takes forever to get going, doesn't it?

41
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:15,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm like, the game that plays itself I'm just going to sit back and eat some rice and watch a movie Which is basically how I've been treating it It's like, oh, it's a movie that I can push a button every so often

42
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:16,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

43
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:38,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a long day yesterday because it was Yom Kippur.

44
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:46,693
[SPEAKER_05]: To sum it up in a nutshell, it's the Day of Atonement.

45
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:49,636
[SPEAKER_05]: You apologize a lot and don't need anything.

46
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:52,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's putting a really simplistic view on it.

47
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very beautiful service.

48
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy to have attended all day.

49
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy to eat when the sun went down.

50
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So, after 24 hours of fasting, Betty fucking Crocker sound pretty good, huh?

51
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:09,464
[SPEAKER_05]: More like 20... 26 hours?

52
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:09,464
25?

53
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:11,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but who's counting?

54
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:12,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Before sundown and then post sundown.

55
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:13,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

56
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you end up counting.

57
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:16,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh...

58
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:19,254
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

59
00:04:38,290 --> 00:05:00,643
[SPEAKER_10]: and three poster designs tomorrow speaking of other podcasts the Robin Extifer Warcraft show is supposed to start this week but sadly we ran into some technical difficulties we can't seem to do Skype on my computer I can't do Skype I'm frustrated no I can't do Skype on my home computer like I can on the one here in the studio so we weren't able to do our little thing so I don't know what we're gonna do we'll figure it out we're smart people

60
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:02,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in time for Cataclysm.

61
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:03,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you smart fellers?

62
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:04,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

63
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you smart fellers or fart smellers?

64
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:07,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

65
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:10,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

66
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:10,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

67
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,657
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week?

68
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:13,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fine.

69
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:17,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my iPod finally, so I downloaded a bunch of stuff on there.

70
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:26,830
[SPEAKER_09]: and, uh, let's see, I'm, I tried a little bit of, uh, Plants vs. Zombies, because I have yet to jump into that, and it's pretty fun.

71
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, hopefully gonna play a little bit more of that, other than, like, two minutes worth.

72
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, uh, what else did I play?

73
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:34,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

74
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:40,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Played some of the Mirror's Edge game on the iPhone, which is kind of neat.

75
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:45,599
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very simplistic, but it still has that kind of same look as the full game.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Fruit Ninja, because that's really easy and casual.

77
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:57,383
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually kind of downloaded that because it's actually one of the ones that is supported by Game Center.

78
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,084
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought it'd be neat to try out.

79
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:09,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course I had to download Robot Unicorn Attack because, well, I don't think I need to explain myself there.

80
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:16,268
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so surreal to me that you're coming in here and playing with your little iPod now.

81
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:20,469
[SPEAKER_10]: This is after a good, I don't know, eight years of just Apple hatred.

82
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:21,829
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I still hate Apple.

83
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,250
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I still hate Apple.

84
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,790
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're sitting there playing with your iPod.

85
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, hey Rob, let me see what apps you have.

86
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Jamie, let me see your phone.

87
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,671
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really funny to me.

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, it's very convenient for browsing the web.

89
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:39,428
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, Nelly's mom came over and she's like, I need the 800 number for AAA.

90
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And Nelly was like, okay, well, let me boot up my laptop.

91
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:47,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, okay, hold on, let me real quickly just turn my iPod on, hit the web browser, done.

92
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,136
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:07,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so it's neat.

94
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:13,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other thing that I got with that is I got a Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200, which is a 3G hotspot.

95
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,281
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm actually using that right now to connect to the web.

96
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:23,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It's literally, it is smaller than the iPod that I have right now, but it works pretty well.

97
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:27,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like 40 bucks a month flat, so I'm kind of digging that a little bit.

98
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Console games, of course, Playmore Grand Theft Auto, because that's just...

99
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:34,669
[SPEAKER_09]: A given.

100
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:39,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Really ain't playing too much else other than that because I just haven't had time.

101
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:45,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Wife's keeping me busy with keeping the baby out of her hair.

102
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:47,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking baby.

103
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that gives me no time to do anything.

104
00:07:51,776 --> 00:08:00,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really sad because I wanted to work on stuff this weekend and instead I had to go shop for groceries for two hours and run a bunch of errands.

105
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I come back home and she's like...

106
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been sitting here with the baby for all this time and he won't stop crying.

107
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:07,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, you take him.

108
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:09,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, oh yeah, I haven't been doing anything at all.

109
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:12,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been, you know, playing around.

110
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,764
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you get for making babies.

111
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:22,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, that's basically all I've done this week is mainly download a ton of apps.

112
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I've spent way too much money on apps, so that's for sure.

113
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to cut back on that.

114
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,687
[SPEAKER_10]: This little 3G router thingy-ma-bobber you have, what is this again?

115
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,888
[SPEAKER_10]: A Virgin Mobile?

116
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's called a MiFi 2200.

117
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,969
[SPEAKER_09]: They have them through Virgin.

118
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:38,770
[SPEAKER_09]: They have them through Sprint, AT&T, I think even.

119
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:59,135
[SPEAKER_09]: and but the plan that's the cheapest is actually the virgin plan and it piggybacks on the Sprint Network and it's it's flat $40 and it's you know there's no plan so if you want to use it you pay 40 bucks and you get a full month worth of unlimited bandwidth unlimited data whatever

120
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:00,075
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

121
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:17,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

122
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a program to send free text messages so I can do that.

123
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a number that's associated with that now so people can text me if they want to.

124
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:47,437
[SPEAKER_10]: You should give out that number here on the show and see what kind of text messages you get during the week.

125
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi Loki, I'm in the potty!

126
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be quite foolish.

127
00:09:56,904 --> 00:10:02,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I have that, and then, I don't know, I've just, I've been downloading a bunch of junk.

128
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:10,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what, I sit there, you know, I have the baby in my arm, and I'm sitting there just kind of browsing the internet, and I'm like, okay, hmm, what apps could I possibly need?

129
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I know.

130
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,457
[SPEAKER_09]: They just talked about Police Scanner app on TV.

131
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:16,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to download that.

132
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:17,938
[SPEAKER_09]: He's an appaholic.

133
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:19,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in two months, the novelty will wear off.

135
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:30,886
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, it doesn't matter, though, because I didn't really pay any money for this, although I did spend a lot of money on apps, so Apple still wins in this.

136
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:35,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com, they always make A-plus comments, such as this one.

137
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:38,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Alf in chat says, Now Loki's butt will have cancer.

138
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm assuming that's from the router.

139
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:41,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

140
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:48,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't always... Being in your butt or next to your butt or wherever it is in close proximity to your butt will somehow give you butt cancer.

141
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:54,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can't really use it too much in my back pocket because if I sit down, it turns it off.

142
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's not good.

143
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,659
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, that's where I store it for now.

144
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't store it in my butt, but in my pocket, yes.

145
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:09,468
[SPEAKER_10]: But if somebody did store it in their butt, they'd be like 3G everywhere they go.

146
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:12,531
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still cool though, because see, not only can I... You can name the network, Rob's butt.

147
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:18,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only can I connect to that, but it can sort of port up the five devices at once.

148
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd imagine it'd be very slow with five devices connected to it, but...

149
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:24,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm connected to your butt right now.

150
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,720
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

151
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's introduce the guests because they're dying to make a comment.

152
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been forever, really, since these two have been on the show.

153
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:33,524
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're quite the duo.

154
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:37,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, I'm sure you've heard these guys on the show.

155
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:38,987
[SPEAKER_10]: They're loved by the masses.

156
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:39,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

157
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I just say that to talk about.

158
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to Rice Princess.

159
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,070
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

160
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:46,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, can we hear you?

161
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:47,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that on?

162
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:49,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Lalalala, Jerk

163
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:04,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and hi.

164
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:04,666
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

165
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Also say hello to the one and only The Doctor is back.

166
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:08,968
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm The Doctor.

167
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:09,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what's up?

168
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:10,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty good.

169
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:10,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty good.

170
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:16,051
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want you to say Rob's butt has been in network for years and years and years.

171
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,171
[SPEAKER_18]: That's pretty much the only comment.

172
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:19,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

173
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:23,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm seeing the Sonic Screwdriver, which was also working Rob's butt.

174
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,334
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to play with the Sonic Screwdriver.

175
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:25,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Here you go.

176
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:29,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not comfortable with how much of the discussion on this show is about my butt.

177
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:31,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not okay with that.

178
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:31,917
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your own fault.

179
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:32,797
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

180
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:33,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

181
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, what the hell have you been up to, Rice Princess?

182
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:42,662
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't been on the show in like a year, it seems like, because I don't think you've been since we've been here at Studio Sakura.

183
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:51,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't, and I'm kind of insulted that you didn't notice that the Doctor and I are wearing... You are wearing Masked in Castlevania shirts, because it's old school and new school.

184
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:55,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, mine's better, but... Isn't today a special day in the relationship between you and the Doctor?

185
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the first time we had sex.

186
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's straight.

187
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,286
[SPEAKER_10]: And me?

188
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:02,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

189
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:06,389
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was... No, September 9th, 2000.

190
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:08,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

191
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Was the night we all met.

192
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

193
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for some reason... No, it was Irene I met in November.

194
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:17,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and then we all went back to your apartment and played Wheel of Fortune.

195
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:17,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

196
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:18,557
[SPEAKER_10]: In Roseville.

197
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:19,878
[SPEAKER_18]: And butt sex.

198
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:21,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob's Network was on that night.

199
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

200
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,223
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've got a gift to regale you with.

201
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:27,863
[SPEAKER_18]: You can open later.

202
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:29,284
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't have to bring gifts.

203
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:29,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's right.

204
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll take it.

205
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:30,745
[SPEAKER_10]: It's poop.

206
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:33,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

207
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,149
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're wearing matching Castle... Well, they're not matching Castlevania shirts.

208
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,590
[SPEAKER_10]: It's old school Castlevania new school.

209
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's Symphony of the Night, so mine's automatically cooler.

210
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, his is old school.

211
00:13:41,632 --> 00:13:42,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But his is great.

212
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like his too.

213
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:45,975
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we have to push the start key now.

214
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:46,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

215
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:46,595
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

216
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to ask where that is.

217
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But where is the start key is the question.

218
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:51,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Finding is the game, actually.

219
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,399
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the other game.

220
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,440
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a scary game.

221
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:54,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

222
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Since you guys haven't been on the show in a while, we actually have some new listeners.

223
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe it or not, people actually subscribe to the show and stay subscribed.

224
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:06,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same five people under different names?

225
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:11,687
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we've got emails and people are like, hey, I just started listening and my first show was the fuck show.

226
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, really?

227
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And you didn't unsubscribe after that?

228
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, that's amazing.

229
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:16,388
[SPEAKER_10]: You're weird.

230
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:21,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those that maybe haven't heard you on the show before, what kind of video games are you into?

231
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:21,870
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you like to play?

232
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,311
[SPEAKER_10]: What types of stuff have you been playing right now, Rice Princess?

233
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:28,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play anything now except for WoW because I have a love-hate relationship with it.

234
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:34,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like Super Nintendo games, Nintendo games, older stuff.

235
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:35,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Retro stuff?

236
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:38,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't really played much on the newer gen.

237
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,807
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you say is a totally underrated retro game?

238
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Clash at Demon Head.

239
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:44,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you were going to say that.

240
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you knew I was going to say that.

241
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that game underrated?

242
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's fucking awesome and no one's played it.

243
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get a little hot when you saw that the band in the Scott Pilgrim movie was called Clash of Demon Head?

244
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because I was probably the only person in the theater who's actually played that game.

245
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:00,456
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

246
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:01,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I liked it a lot.

247
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:02,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

248
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:03,118
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, Eddie?

249
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:04,079
[SPEAKER_03]: How about The Doctor?

250
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,120
[SPEAKER_10]: The Doctor, what types of games have you been playing lately?

251
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,802
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, not much lately because like the Rice Princess, I own a Wii.

252
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:15,064
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm a very angry Wii player because there's no games for it.

253
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:18,566
[SPEAKER_18]: I looked at my Wii history for the past six months and it's just Netflix.

254
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,267
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no games being played.

255
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:26,190
[SPEAKER_18]: But before that, I had downloaded Cave Story on the virtual console, which is a really fun 8-bit style game.

256
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,931
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, I like a lot of old school stuff.

257
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:31,954
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the new stuff, I just don't like Halo and Call of Duty and stuff.

258
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:35,576
[SPEAKER_18]: So I like adventure type games, and there's not a lot of that on the Wii.

259
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,217
[SPEAKER_18]: It's mostly a soccer mom console now.

260
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:38,658
[SPEAKER_18]: What about Metroid Other M?

261
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,980
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the big... I've heard terrible reviews on that though.

262
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,341
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to play it, but I've heard terrible reviews.

263
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you guys think.

264
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:51,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little worried, because it's supposed to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, and I've heard a lot of awful things about it, but I've heard some really good things about it, so I don't know.

265
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard play-wise, it's fantastic.

266
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:55,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Story-wise, it's balls.

267
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,491
[SPEAKER_05]: and not the good kind of balls.

268
00:15:58,671 --> 00:15:59,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray D.N.

269
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:03,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Silvergun in our chat room says, I get it, says you should get Sin and Punishment 2.

270
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:06,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

271
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:08,737
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Sin and Punishment 2?

272
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:10,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell that is.

273
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:11,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the Wii.

274
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I still don't know what it is.

275
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you, him.

276
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fine.

277
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you.

278
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:15,541
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for him.

279
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:15,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Shooter.

280
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's another shooter, which, you know, I'd play that if I wanted to go to sleep, so.

281
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:21,645
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, fine.

282
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:28,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust the industry nowadays because remember how they said Shattered Memories was like the best game at E3?

283
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking worst game ever made.

284
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:33,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I just want to punch Silent Hill.

285
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,074
[SPEAKER_03]: What was wrong with Silent Hill Shattered Memories?

286
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

287
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a game.

288
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, here, I'm going to poop on your face.

289
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,639
[SPEAKER_10]: E3 game of the year.

290
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember the poop on your face scene, actually.

291
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it because that's all that happened over and over.

292
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:47,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I...

293
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:51,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... Like, oh my gosh, oh, Alessa, it's you.

294
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:52,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Boop on your face.

295
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you son of a bitch, you got me again.

296
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:00,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was going to be different this time, but no.

297
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:01,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you and I play the same game?

298
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just remember the snow and a lot of running.

299
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:07,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember... Yeah, you didn't see the tracks of, like, shit everywhere?

300
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:08,979
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

301
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

302
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I got, like, the director's cut or something.

303
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:16,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I got the shit on your face version.

304
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll stop cussing now.

305
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:18,626
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

306
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:19,326
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's all right.

307
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:20,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a family show.

308
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:22,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

309
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,209
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week.

310
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:24,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Exposure.

311
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:25,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Exposure.

312
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:26,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

313
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,670
[SPEAKER_10]: What types of stuff did I play this week?

314
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

315
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:29,691
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

316
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of new stuff.

317
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:31,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

318
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:32,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

319
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:32,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

320
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play WoW.

321
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:39,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I played the WoW beta today because I finally got my character to copy over, so I was able to look at the new zones.

322
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you done any of the sillies or the flirts?

323
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:44,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They are raunchy!

324
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,098
[SPEAKER_03]: For the new character?

325
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:48,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for goblins and... I haven't.

326
00:17:48,559 --> 00:18:01,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a worgen to like level 6, and I got all excited because female worgens showed up like this week, but you can't... You can make one and see what it looks like, but you can't actually click the button that says create the character.

327
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it says decline or whatever.

328
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:03,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, invalid.

329
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:04,486
[SPEAKER_10]: That's bootsy.

330
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:04,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

331
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:09,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a PG-13 thing anymore.

332
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like getting into R-rated material.

333
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:17,430
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the female goblins, I think it's a flirt, was like, yeah, and then he asked me to go up on him.

334
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, what the hell?

335
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:21,631
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty funny.

336
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:22,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're just getting too old.

337
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:26,093
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but then there was another one where he's like, I've got something for you.

338
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:28,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he just unzips his pants.

339
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:31,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just straight up sexual.

340
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not teenager stuff.

341
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,892
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Rob was like, let's release the Sassy Squad.

342
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:37,773
[SPEAKER_18]: He took his pants off.

343
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:39,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I quit playing WoW at the wrong time?

344
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:41,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the Sassy Squad anymore.

345
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm paladin now.

346
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:43,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

347
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:44,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo.

348
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:45,378
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have the sassy hair.

349
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:49,480
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but Alan plays the Boomkin now.

350
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,681
[SPEAKER_10]: So he has a Sassy Squad.

351
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:51,501
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what they're called.

352
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Not nearly as sassy as your squad.

353
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:53,142
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

354
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,044
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually is really good.

355
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,425
[SPEAKER_10]: He really is a great Boomkin.

356
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,146
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big fucking geek.

357
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not just saying that because he's listening.

358
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,329
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows what he's doing in that game.

359
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

360
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I just push three buttons.

361
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:09,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hunter, you know, but he's like, oh, you just do this to raise your hit cap and blah, blah, blah.

362
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:09,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what?

363
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:11,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Speak English.

364
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:21,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing is that the beta, I started playing the beta today with my paladin and going into some of the new Love Lady areas.

365
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,011
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went to Mount Hyjal, right, and started fighting some of the new monsters.

366
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow got hard.

367
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:26,492
[SPEAKER_10]: It did.

368
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:31,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Like all of a sudden, like I went from having two heels to having like six.

369
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:31,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

370
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know like which one to cast.

371
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:38,058
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my rep palette is like all like, oh, now you got to have holy power to do all this shit.

372
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And oh my God, they changed everything.

373
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,139
[SPEAKER_10]: It hurts.

374
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:49,682
[SPEAKER_03]: They did, and Extifer, our buddy Extifer, he tried to heal for one of the raids, and he's like, I couldn't keep anyone above 50% health, and blah, blah, blah.

375
00:19:49,742 --> 00:19:54,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I don't really know what that means because I'm not a healer, but that sucks, I guess.

376
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:54,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

377
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:57,865
[SPEAKER_03]: You make it sound like it's terrible, so I guess it is.

378
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he was saying it was really hard.

379
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,206
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what I have?

380
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:02,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Photon torpedoes.

381
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:04,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

382
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:05,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've got quantum torpedoes.

383
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm using transphasic torpedoes.

384
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:12,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Why aren't you playing Star Trek Online?

385
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:14,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he doesn't play MMOs.

386
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,045
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried playing WoW for like a week.

387
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,306
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what he did in WoW?

388
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:24,410
[SPEAKER_03]: He would hide in the Moonwell ponds and do Shadowmeld and when someone would run by he'd go boo and come out of Shadowmeld.

389
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:27,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the extent of his experience in WoW.

390
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Why didn't he play on a roleplay server?

391
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why?

392
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:35,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Because his computer lagged so hard.

393
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:38,339
[SPEAKER_03]: He would run in place like eight times and just

394
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:44,257
[SPEAKER_18]: My computer had like 200 megabytes of RAM, and so it was like I couldn't play WoW, so it was terrible.

395
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,197
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what I did.

396
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:49,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had to upgrade my graphics card and everything to run Star Trek Online decently.

397
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:50,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

398
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

399
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:55,726
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, the chat room's all bitching like, oh, I don't understand what you're talking about.

400
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:56,867
[SPEAKER_10]: You lost me after Paladin.

401
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go play Shattered Memories and get shit on my face.

402
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me move on.

403
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:02,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

404
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:06,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And then SSJ100Matt says, at least it's better than Final Fantasy XI.

405
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:08,323
[SPEAKER_03]: That's totally true.

406
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:09,163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not saying much.

407
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,824
[SPEAKER_10]: What about 14, huh?

408
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:12,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that gem.

409
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:12,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not go there.

410
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,567
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, and then I played some iPhone games.

411
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:21,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, speaking of MMOs, I played a new iPhone MMO that's so much better than the one I played last week.

412
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is called, I forget the name.

413
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:25,592
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Legends.

414
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:27,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

415
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's short for something else.

416
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:30,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Player Legends or Play Legends or something.

417
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:31,276
[SPEAKER_10]: It's free.

418
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:32,396
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat.

419
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:33,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got 3D.

420
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds unique and not generic at all.

421
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's horrible.

422
00:21:56,795 --> 00:22:04,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I watch Hoarders because A, Alan likes to joke about how that's going to be us in like 20 years, but B, it actually makes me feel better about myself.

423
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you'd asked me before I'd watched that show, like, Rob, are you a hoarder?

424
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:11,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably would have said, yeah, I'm a little bit of a hoarder.

425
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:13,905
[SPEAKER_10]: But after watching that show, I'm like, no, no, absolutely not.

426
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:14,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, hell no.

427
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd never let it get that bad.

428
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:19,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty bad on that show.

429
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you're just getting a little...

430
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, I've known you for a while.

431
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:24,994
You know.

432
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:30,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the things on that show are really, I would never let an animal die under all this stuff.

433
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,369
[SPEAKER_03]: That you know of.

434
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:32,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

435
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,410
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

436
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

437
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,692
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why Rob doesn't have a kitty.

438
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or Zach and Kelly.

439
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:39,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember them?

440
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:40,294
[SPEAKER_10]: That was different.

441
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,816
[SPEAKER_03]: That was different, huh?

442
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:46,598
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't die under the weight of crap around the house or anything.

443
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,960
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually had their own little tank that they could swim around in.

444
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,660
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not my fault.

445
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:53,202
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them decided to swim right up the filter and die.

446
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:54,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened to the other one?

447
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:57,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I flushed him down the toilet.

448
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:57,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

449
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it alive when you did?

450
00:22:59,308 --> 00:22:59,848
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

451
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,590
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one died of sadness.

452
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:05,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't feed him for a week and he was so sad.

453
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:06,256
[SPEAKER_10]: He died.

454
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:12,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, if your little fish friend just decided to seppuku up the filter when you're just... I don't think you seppuku'd.

455
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you bought the wrong one.

456
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:15,246
[SPEAKER_03]: You murdered!

457
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:17,947
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

458
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:49,110
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I like the Futurama spoof where it was like, here's a twit now.

459
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:51,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

460
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

461
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:54,219
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where you can go.

462
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:55,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

463
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:58,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have any cute shoes How about video game news?

464
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:08,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Actual bonafide video game news Because the Tokyo Game Show happened this week So there's a lot of news out of there But we're not starting there tonight, actually What a horrible segue Where are we starting tonight, Loki?

465
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:23,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes, we're starting with This is funny because I could have been affected by this But thanks to procrastination I was not The MMO APB Or what I like to call Grand Theft Auto The MMO

466
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:45,631
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a cops and robbers MMO game developed by Realtime Worlds who did the wonderful game Crackdown and it launched in the US on June 29th and basically had players playing both the Enforcers and Criminals and...

467
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:47,772
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

468
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:21,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Real-time worlds faced massive layoffs last month and I guess before going into administration, which is I guess the UK equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

469
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, the...

470
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:27,718
[SPEAKER_09]: They weren't doing too well.

471
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:36,663
[SPEAKER_09]: The quote on the official website is, APB had a fantastic journey, but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end.

472
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:42,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service running, APB is coming to a close.

473
00:25:43,086 --> 00:25:49,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been a pleasure working on APB, and with all of its players together, we will be building an absolutely amazing game.

474
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we were building an absolutely amazing game, and for that we thank you.

475
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,052
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are awesome.

476
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:57,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thousands of you that paid for this game just got effed in the A, right?

477
00:25:58,795 --> 00:25:59,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah.

478
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:01,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not hearing a lot about the backlash.

479
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:03,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it just because literally no one bought this game?

480
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:10,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, I mean, it seems so strange to me that an MMO could just get away with shutting down after three months.

481
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,604
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't even really an MMO.

482
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:15,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's barely an MMO, especially by today's standards for multiplayer games.

483
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:21,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was 100 player instances, basically, that you got to play in.

484
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you play it offline, though?

485
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:23,832
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

486
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:32,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so if you dropped $60 on this game just three months ago, you paid $20 a month and then some for... Bleh.

487
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:33,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

488
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:34,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That stinks.

489
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:40,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if any of our listeners are the type that get...

490
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:10,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you talked about this game an awful lot before it came out, and then you didn't.

491
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, did you even get into it?

492
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:15,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in the beta, so I played it for a little bit.

493
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:16,460
[SPEAKER_09]: It was okay.

494
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,782
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of those things I didn't want to buy because I didn't think I had time to play it.

495
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:23,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I had, I definitely wouldn't have had time to play it.

496
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I didn't buy it.

497
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:27,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun to check it out.

498
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:33,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too bad because I think it would have worked better as a console game

499
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:39,455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like something that should have been as a Saints Row type of thing or something like that.

500
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:52,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Have the actual main storyline and everything and have some really fleshed out online mode where you can play either the cops or the enforcers and level up and have a really cool character editor and stuff like that.

501
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,406
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I could have saw this being, but it wasn't.

502
00:27:57,207 --> 00:28:04,672
[SPEAKER_09]: However, all may not be lost because apparently Epic Games is interested in buying the rights to the game.

503
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:09,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we'll see APB come back in some other form.

504
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:11,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Be interesting.

505
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:26,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Eurogamer was reporting this, saying that according to the BBC, sourced close to the development team, a few companies are showing interest in picking up APB's rights.

506
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:30,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently one of those companies is Epic Games.

507
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:34,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the company behind the Gears of War and Unreal Tournament series.

508
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:48,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And also adding to the speculation, Eurogamer, they were citing Dundee Development Source, in real time, I guess was based in Dundee, Scotland, that Dave Jones, the real time world's boss...

509
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:55,377
[SPEAKER_09]: and Epic is quite the talking point in the town.

510
00:28:55,517 --> 00:29:05,024
[SPEAKER_09]: He says he and Mr. Rain are good chums and have worked together on many levels for years and years and years and he's not going to raise much money and staff here in the near future.

511
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,317
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sounding like that maybe Epic will buy them.

512
00:29:10,297 --> 00:29:15,458
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's good, but still, I mean, what type of precedence is this set for the future?

513
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:22,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm still just picturing, you know, thousands, or well, at least hundreds of angry gamers that bought this game.

514
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Tens of angry gamers.

515
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Tens of angry gamers that bought this game that feel really screwed about it closing.

516
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:30,482
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

517
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,800
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first time this has ever happened on The Sims that the shirt just disappears.

518
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,582
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura doesn't prefer to actually listen to the show when it's going on.

519
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:45,644
[SPEAKER_10]: She plays The Sims while the show's going on and we all look over there.

520
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:48,305
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, don't know why, we just all kind of look over at her computer.

521
00:29:48,345 --> 00:29:55,809
[SPEAKER_10]: She's dressing some character right now and it's a female character she's dressing and we look over there and no top, no top on, just titties hanging out.

522
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,645
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of game are you playing over there?

523
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:03,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, I tried to change her shirt and all of a sudden her boobs just pop out.

524
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,009
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens.

525
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Question in our chatroom at chat.orangelaundry.com or more of a statement from our buddy Seg.

526
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:12,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen him in chat in forever.

527
00:30:12,696 --> 00:30:14,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Seg.

528
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:18,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch it become like Uru missed online and never die.

529
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Missed online got resurrected about three or four times.

530
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:22,384
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

531
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:23,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be neat.

532
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:24,193
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

533
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:28,195
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, you know, doing 100 player instances is not really an MMO.

534
00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:29,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look at MAG.

535
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:35,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's, I think, what, got 128 players at a time?

536
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:36,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And they all call it an MMO.

537
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:40,861
[SPEAKER_09]: They call it like an MMO action game, I guess, or something like that.

538
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:48,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is all an elaborate scheme to justify the online pass because the people who made this game didn't charge for the online pass, did they?

539
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:53,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they're going to say, well, because we weren't charging the $10 premium, we had to shut down the servers.

540
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't make any sense.

541
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:58,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would they charge for an online pass if they're charging for online anyways?

542
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:00,819
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a used market for PC titles.

544
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why not?

545
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,881
[SPEAKER_10]: What's stopping them these days?

546
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

547
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,882
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to pay another $10 for online access.

548
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't play without online access.

549
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:09,947
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.

550
00:31:10,127 --> 00:31:20,194
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, every time we play these games, especially the online ones, we have to accept terms of conditions, a user agreement, basically, right?

551
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:25,318
[SPEAKER_10]: When are we going to make the company sign the company agreement when we buy their games?

552
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:31,663
[SPEAKER_10]: If I plop $60 on this game, you need to keep the damn servers up for at least a year or X, Y, Z.

553
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:43,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Unrealistic, yes, but I just think this is a bad precedence if this just kind of slips away and people are just like, oh, well, it was a crappy game anyway.

554
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:45,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

555
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:53,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should get their money back, or people that bought it should get their money back, but unfortunately the company has no money to give back, so... Oh well.

556
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:55,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad.

557
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:57,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Live and learn.

558
00:31:58,138 --> 00:32:02,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if you have one of those Best Buy replacement plans, you can go take the game back and say it don't work no more.

559
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:04,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

560
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:04,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

561
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,060
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if that works.

562
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that might have worked a little better had it come out would have been this patent that was discovered by Sony last week.

563
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:15,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a last-gen console adapter.

564
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:24,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Could explain why there was never PS2 backwards compatibility after, of course, the very, very first PlayStation 3 console.

565
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It was removed from the console pretty quickly to help cut down on cost.

566
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:32,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there were rumors that it was going to come out on the download service, the PlayStation Network.

567
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,416
[SPEAKER_10]: We would see PlayStation 2 games, but that never seemed to happen either.

568
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:52,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently one of the tech sites over in Japan, Gigazine, discovered a patent that was filed by Sony Japan back in February of 2009, which described an adapter, and it would serve as a bridge for older gen games to be played on a current gen console.

569
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:58,077
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, when I look at the picture, it looks like you are attaching a PlayStation 2 to your PlayStation 3.

570
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:00,179
[SPEAKER_09]: That is retarded.

571
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:00,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

572
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it bad I still kind of want one?

573
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:04,864
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

574
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:06,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what they would do, too.

575
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:07,046
[SPEAKER_09]: They would charge like $150 for that.

576
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though the PS2 is $100.

577
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:11,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

578
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:12,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they don't learn.

579
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,915
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, you know, oh, hey, we're going to release this system.

580
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:17,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to call it the PSP Go.

581
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:31,363
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah we know that the regular PSP is out right now for like $150 and that it can play UMD discs but this new PSP that we're releasing it's not going to be able to play UMD discs you're going to have to download all your tiles oh and we're going to charge $200 for it oh I'm sorry no $250 for it

582
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:34,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Smart.

583
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, something to keep in mind, just to be technical.

584
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:38,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and a PS3.

585
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:38,355
[SPEAKER_09]: That's only $2.99.

586
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:43,159
[SPEAKER_10]: The patent doesn't specifically say it's for PlayStation 2 games.

587
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,002
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just for older games.

588
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:50,766
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you think about it, okay, PlayStation 3 already plays PlayStation 1 games.

589
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:51,827
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

590
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,289
[SPEAKER_10]: You need this additional adapter to play.

591
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:59,154
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's going to play Dreamcast games and Sega CD games.

592
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: It plays HD DVD.

593
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:01,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew?

594
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:02,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

595
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,177
[SPEAKER_03]: That's backwards compatible.

596
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:04,878
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

597
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

598
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:09,341
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't sound like this would be too incredibly popular if it came out.

599
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:09,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

600
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:13,023
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was the right price, I'd probably buy it.

601
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:13,703
[SPEAKER_10]: You know why?

602
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,665
[SPEAKER_10]: To save on the shelf space.

603
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't... How do you figure?

604
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:24,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if I have to get a PlayStation 2 out to hook up, that's a whole other AC adapter.

605
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:26,992
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole other set of RGB cords.

606
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:29,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other... Girlfriend, you just lazy.

607
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:31,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You... Yeah, pretty much.

608
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:31,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Lazy.

609
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:32,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

610
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:32,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you're wrong.

611
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,978
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not another set of RGB courts.

612
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:37,920
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually the exact same set.

613
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have to move it from the PS3 to PS2.

614
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:40,662
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

615
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:42,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably just spypainted a PS2.

616
00:34:42,323 --> 00:34:43,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's definitely worth $150.

617
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:43,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

618
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:47,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, oh, let's change this to an off-gray.

619
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can spend, I don't know, $10...

620
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:53,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

621
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:20,238
[SPEAKER_10]: This Screeching Hall was brought to you by DarkSakura and her lovely insights.

622
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:26,403
[SPEAKER_10]: What if it like up-res the resolution of the game?

623
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:29,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'd be so amazing.

624
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,786
[SPEAKER_10]: If only a console did that already.

625
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:33,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3 does.

626
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:34,770
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so crazy.

627
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,630
[SPEAKER_10]: But not for PS2 games.

628
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:39,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It did if you got one of the launch systems.

629
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:39,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, too bad...

630
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:41,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of people bought one of the launches.

631
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:43,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you should have done that.

632
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:45,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Lower your standards.

633
00:35:45,658 --> 00:35:47,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me $700 or whatever the hell those things cost back then.

634
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,581
[SPEAKER_10]: They were crazy.

635
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:48,921
[SPEAKER_10]: $599 US dollars.

636
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:49,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Well.

637
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:54,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

638
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:56,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm over it.

639
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:58,628
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are mean.

640
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:05,012
[SPEAKER_09]: The best part about that though is I have one of those systems that plays PlayStation 2 games and I don't play any PlayStation 2 games in it at all.

641
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:11,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I would play Final Fantasy 12, .hack because I never did beat it, and Magic Pen Gel.

642
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:13,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't you have a PS2 already?

643
00:36:13,616 --> 00:36:14,737
[SPEAKER_10]: In a box somewhere.

644
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,999
[SPEAKER_05]: We've used ours to play PS2 games.

645
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to actually look for my PS2.

646
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:24,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go buy this thing for my PS3.

647
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,498
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't understand.

648
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:26,439
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't.

649
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,901
[SPEAKER_10]: A, there's no guarantee the PS2 still works.

650
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:34,724
[SPEAKER_10]: B, it's a whole other set of cords that you have to hook into the back of the TV.

651
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: God, you must be the laziest person.

652
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,786
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no guarantee that it works, so I'm not even going to try.

653
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:43,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to drop this hundred whatever the fuck dollars on this thing.

654
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:49,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You were here the other week when we had the 32X hooked up, and that's a whole bunch of cables.

655
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:50,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

656
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:24,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that my TV has something like three HDMI things and then a bunch of AV and like some S-video and like the little one that you use the switch for.

657
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:25,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's nice.

658
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,021
[SPEAKER_10]: My TV is from Costco.

659
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,401
[SPEAKER_10]: So is ours.

660
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:30,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Our TV is from Costco.

661
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,284
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not a valid excuse.

662
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I rendered your excuse invalid.

663
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear my thing only has like two inputs and an HDMI.

664
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yours sucks.

665
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:38,889
[SPEAKER_10]: You should return it.

666
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry that your thing only has two inputs.

667
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story!

668
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about some more PS3 news?

669
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be a new system update 3.42.

670
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:57,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't they just give them regular numbers instead of points?

671
00:37:58,331 --> 00:37:59,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't it be update number 4?

672
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:00,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Update number 5?

673
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:01,113
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

674
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now they'd be at update number 62.

675
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,495
[SPEAKER_10]: They're bitches.

676
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:09,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the whole number updates are for major, major, major updates.

677
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:11,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is just, hey, we're adding Blu-ray.

678
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the next one is 3.5.

679
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:16,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we just got 3.42.

680
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:23,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one is going to add 3D Blu-ray movie support since it can already do 3D with games.

681
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:36,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And that date is actually out for the Japanese market on September 21st, but I guess it's going to be after?

682
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:37,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you screw driving?

683
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:38,256
[SPEAKER_05]: He's screwing me.

684
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:38,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you screw driving?

685
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:01,903
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a Sony TV.

686
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting you a Sony TV.

687
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:05,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be a 3D TV.

688
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:07,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell your Sony rep to get me a TV.

689
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you watch Avatar?

690
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:09,929
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we can't.

691
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:12,191
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not 3D Blu-ray.

692
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:17,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that will be in the super extended Uber James Cameron's cock Blu-ray edition.

693
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:18,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

694
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:21,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Until then, though, all we have is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

695
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:24,980
[SPEAKER_09]: That's seriously the only damn movie that's in 3D.

696
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:26,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is also James Cameron's cock.

697
00:39:29,438 --> 00:39:31,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, by the way, don't watch... It's meaty balls.

698
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:32,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Cloudy with a chance of balls.

699
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameron balls.

700
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:39,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't watch Resident Evil Afterlife, and especially don't watch it in 3D.

701
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:42,762
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

702
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:43,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't you like that?

703
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see it.

704
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:45,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kidding, right?

705
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,365
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I liked it.

706
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:47,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You're being facetious.

707
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me you're being facetious.

708
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:49,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not being facetious.

709
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:49,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me.

710
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:50,928
[SPEAKER_03]: My head's going to explode.

711
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:51,289
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

712
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:57,314
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be one of the only movies that I would actually want to go see in 3D because you know it's going to be ridiculous.

713
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:00,496
[SPEAKER_18]: You know it's just like going to an amusement park.

714
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:00,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

715
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,418
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you not like about it?

716
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, the movie itself was fucking ridiculous and stupid.

717
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:10,057
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3D was obviously the added-on 3D.

718
00:40:10,298 --> 00:40:11,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't shot in 3D.

719
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It was shot in 3D.

720
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It was?

721
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:16,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they actually, even when they were writing the script, they were writing with 3D in mind.

722
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:19,648
[SPEAKER_03]: When they were writing the script of Dawn of the Dead.

723
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:21,931
[SPEAKER_10]: They used the same cameras as Avatar did.

724
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:22,752
[SPEAKER_10]: It was this big deal.

725
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:23,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

726
00:40:24,112 --> 00:40:31,934
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but, okay, we actually, we went and saw that, I went and saw that actually on, uh, last week, um, with the D-Box seats.

727
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:35,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've heard about those, the motion seats that actually move and rumble and stuff.

728
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:36,755
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool, okay?

729
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that might have added to it.

730
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:50,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the thing, though, I don't really play the Resident Evil games, so for me, this movie was kind of like, hey, look, it's almost like The Matrix, but not, you know, so I don't know if the storyline ruined it for you, because I couldn't care, you know?

731
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the storyline was stupid, and

732
00:40:52,538 --> 00:40:58,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the extent of the 3D stuff was just, oh, look at this blood flying in your face.

733
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at this building.

734
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crumbling and some of the crumbles are falling in your face.

735
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:04,242
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing exciting about it.

736
00:41:04,282 --> 00:41:08,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just an old crotchety woman that doesn't like 3D, which is entirely possible.

737
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:09,483
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of gimmicky stuff in there.

738
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:10,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It was stupid shit, man.

739
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:11,984
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of throwing stuff at the camera.

740
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:12,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

741
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:14,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I'm throwing my glasses at the camera.

742
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:15,965
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm throwing my axe at the camera.

743
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:19,827
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but that's like one of the only movies that I would go, okay, that's in 3D, that makes sense.

744
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:22,708
[SPEAKER_18]: But like, Eat, Pray, Love, I mean, that doesn't need to be in 3D.

745
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:24,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that really in 3D?

746
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:27,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna pray.

747
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was extending my folded hands forward.

748
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:34,653
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and just the movie itself was really stupid.

749
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:39,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, literally, it was Dawn of the Dead, except with Resident Evil people.

750
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:39,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Spoilers.

751
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:41,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

752
00:41:42,296 --> 00:41:43,397
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen it before.

753
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:47,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we go through this whole 3D craze back in the 80s with like Jaws 3D?

754
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

755
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:49,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like five.

756
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:56,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think, okay, right now in Sony, they were kind of bad for doing it.

757
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:02,409
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation 3 when it first came out was like $600, and they're like, well, that's because it has Blu-ray in it.

758
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, everyone complained, I don't give a fuck, it's $600.

759
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:06,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not buying it.

760
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:11,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because they're kind of jumping, they're trying to push the technology too much.

761
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:26,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like 3D TV, I'm glad you're supporting 3D with your games, and I'm glad you're supporting 3D Blu-ray, because probably you have a little bit of an investment in it, since, I don't know, you have a lot of Blu-ray stuff, you are your own movie company and whatnot.

762
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:48,910
[SPEAKER_09]: um so obviously they're trying to invest some of that in there but it's really not viable now to buy a 3d tv or a 3d blu-ray player because there's hardly any content for it and if you just wait it's gonna get damn cheaper anyways and there's probably something better gonna come out you know they're gonna come out with tvs that don't require stupid glasses on you

763
00:42:49,170 --> 00:43:00,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop is in chat and follows up the comment about Eat, Pray, Love in 3D saying Julia Roberts' mouth in 3D would be a sin of technology.

764
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:02,385
[SPEAKER_03]: See 3D birds.

765
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:08,530
[SPEAKER_10]: There's this picture I sometimes see on Oh No They Didn't and somebody needs to link it in chat.

766
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, find this picture.

767
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:17,295
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a picture of Julia Roberts but it's been photoshopped to really exaggerate her horse mouth and it's really scary.

768
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,196
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes her look like a zombie in Resident Evil.

769
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:21,598
[SPEAKER_03]: She already has an exaggerated horse mouth.

770
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:22,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to see the picture.

771
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:23,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so scary.

772
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:24,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it, Alan.

773
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody will find it for me.

774
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:29,722
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says Rob's still waiting for Showgirls 3D.

775
00:43:30,763 --> 00:43:31,464
[SPEAKER_10]: True story.

776
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:33,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, you want to hear a true story?

777
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:36,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought Showgirls on Blu-ray this week for $18.

778
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:37,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on sale.

779
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,110
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

780
00:43:39,672 --> 00:43:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go watch it.

781
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:43,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I should come over and we should have a Showgirls party.

782
00:43:44,036 --> 00:43:44,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

783
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:46,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to watch the TV version.

784
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have brown rice and vegetables, Rob.

785
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:52,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have a whole little Showgirls party.

786
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:53,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be fun.

787
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:53,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

788
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:57,264
[SPEAKER_09]: That is seriously a movie that needs to be in 3D though.

789
00:43:58,044 --> 00:44:02,327
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not Eat, Pray, Love.

790
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:03,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Showgirls.

791
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, Showgirls.

792
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:07,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Not striptease.

793
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:08,269
[SPEAKER_09]: No one wants to see that.

794
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:09,890
[SPEAKER_18]: I want Saved by the Bell 3D then.

795
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:13,792
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because they had, was it the Piranha 3D or whatever?

796
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:17,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had a whole bunch of like, oh, it's wet t-shirt contest type stuff.

797
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:20,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need more of that with less of the piranhas.

798
00:44:20,315 --> 00:44:23,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the piranhas are cool and all, but you don't need to mix them both together.

799
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:28,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like Nomi's nipples are going to be coming out into your face.

800
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,033
[SPEAKER_09]: But can you imagine, you know, the really weird thrash sex she was doing?

801
00:44:32,073 --> 00:44:33,174
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that in 3D?

802
00:44:33,194 --> 00:44:34,255
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be some scary stuff.

803
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:35,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be scary.

804
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:38,219
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be like, ah, what the fuck is that?

805
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,120
[SPEAKER_03]: You gonna die?

806
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch, I know what's happening in this movie.

807
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:42,945
[SPEAKER_03]: You going down.

808
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Rob, close it now.

809
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:45,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it.

810
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:49,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, times a million.

811
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:52,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the picture I was looking for, or one of them.

812
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:53,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

813
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:54,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

814
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:55,822
[SPEAKER_10]: This is terrible radio.

815
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me leave this nerd chat room.

816
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,943
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on?

817
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:02,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I lost the don't shit my pants game.

818
00:45:02,524 --> 00:45:04,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that like Enzyte guy there?

819
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

820
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:07,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover it up.

821
00:45:07,866 --> 00:45:09,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover it up with that window.

822
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:10,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Move it, Rob.

823
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:10,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't.

824
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:11,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

825
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:12,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Google.

826
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:13,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, or not Google.

827
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:18,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Photobucket because they let you search your pictures and search for Julia Roberts GIF.

828
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Julia Roberts GIF.

829
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will come right up.

830
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the first image.

831
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:23,611
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hilarious.

832
00:45:26,354 --> 00:45:26,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

833
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:33,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator PSN says, I wouldn't mind seeing Angelina Jolie's boobs in 3D.

834
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:33,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

835
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,184
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Wanted might have been kind of cool in 3D because they tried to do some 3D-ish kind of things in that.

836
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,865
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I could see that working.

837
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:48,491
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and with a movie like that, that's just like, this movie is like so hetero, it's dick has a dick, like type of thing.

838
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:49,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's weird.

839
00:45:49,432 --> 00:45:50,692
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not very hetero right there.

840
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:53,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not fuck a dick that had a dick.

841
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:54,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awkward.

842
00:45:54,215 --> 00:45:55,236
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something right out of the...

843
00:45:56,756 --> 00:46:00,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm like, I gotta go now away from your dick.

844
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean, though?

845
00:46:01,957 --> 00:46:02,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

846
00:46:03,038 --> 00:46:06,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be weird if the bullets went around your face in 3D.

847
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:09,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I almost got shot.

848
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:11,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

849
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,879
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm gonna do?

850
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:14,200
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna post that Julia Roberts gift to our Twitter.

851
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

852
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Move past it, Rob.

853
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna see who's not listening to the show right now by seeing the responses we get.

854
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:22,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

855
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:24,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime...

856
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:25,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it work?

857
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:32,099
[SPEAKER_18]: So, back to the Doctor and Vice Princess show.

858
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:32,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

859
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now that we're done with that topic, let's talk about Halo Reach and its shortcomings.

860
00:46:38,983 --> 00:46:44,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo Reach is an awesome game, but somebody didn't test it well enough, and that somebody would be Microsoft.

861
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:51,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo Reach has problems playing on the brand new 4GB Xbox 360 Slimmer system.

862
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:59,392
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because apparently co-op requires a hard drive in order to work, which is dumb to begin with.

863
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:07,535
[SPEAKER_09]: The 4GB of storage that's on those new systems is kind of classified as a memory unit.

864
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:13,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, despite the fact that you have adequate space to store whatever files they want you to store...

865
00:47:14,517 --> 00:47:14,957
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

866
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:34,896
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to play with yourself.

867
00:47:35,057 --> 00:47:40,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, Microsoft has said that they're aware of the issue and this is going to be a temporary issue.

868
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:42,144
[SPEAKER_09]: The company is working to resolve it.

869
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:44,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, come on, man.

870
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:46,709
[SPEAKER_09]: That should have been something that you should have tested first.

871
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:52,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try playing this on each of our SKUs, especially the ones that have just come out, and let's see if it works correctly.

872
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:57,337
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the biggest games for our company.

873
00:47:57,357 --> 00:47:58,957
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be important to do.

874
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:00,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit.

875
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:06,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe they're just trying to upsell those bigger console bundles.

876
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:16,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let me buy your stupid 4GB system and then I have to buy a really expensive hard drive to plug into it because normal hard drives won't work.

877
00:48:17,787 --> 00:48:19,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite the fact that it's a normal hard drive.

878
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:22,391
[SPEAKER_09]: but formatted differently.

879
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:23,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

880
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:25,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally.

881
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:31,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you just allow anybody to put their own hard drives in there?

882
00:48:31,543 --> 00:48:32,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like Sony.

883
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:34,647
[SPEAKER_09]: At least they have that going for them.

884
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:45,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well I'm going to move on to another story here about a website called Good Old Games and a lot of interesting developments that's going on today.

885
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:52,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, after hearing about the developments, I kind of hesitate even bringing up this story on the show in the first place, but it's kind of bold what's going on.

886
00:48:53,385 --> 00:48:58,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Good Old Games is a website located at GOG.com, and we brought them up on the show before.

887
00:48:58,648 --> 00:49:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a website where you can buy old games, like the King's Quest series, and just old PC games from back in the day for $5 or $10, and it's all DRM-free.

888
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:13,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Fallout 2, just older PC games.

889
00:49:13,574 --> 00:49:15,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of like legalized abandonware, basically.

890
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:43,176
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, for companies that still want to sell their old games Well, they shut down today and posted a notice on their website that says We recently had to give serious thought as to whether we could really keep GOG.com going the way it is We've debated on it for quite some time and unfortunately we've decided that GOG.com simply cannot remain in its current form So the website, you know, a lot of news sites kind of post about this Oh, this is such a good idea, you know, it made this thing legal and, you know, it was good karma to buy the games and stuff

891
00:49:43,916 --> 00:50:05,188
[SPEAKER_10]: and now they've shut down oh it's a bummer to see them go but now it's coming out today did they really shut down or is this all a marketing ploy and that is apparently the latest news that is coming out is that this is actually a marketing ploy about their change from the beta version of GOG.com to the full version of GOG.com

892
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:25,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And in an article that Kotaku ran, they actually got an update from spokesman Tom Ole Well, he's kind of an a-hole if this whole thing turns out to be true Saying, quote, as the message on the site says, this doesn't mean that GOG is gone We'll have more to share in the coming days

893
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:27,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

894
00:50:27,965 --> 00:50:28,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of bootsy.

895
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:29,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that.

896
00:50:50,262 --> 00:51:19,317
[SPEAKER_10]: well what's interesting is that now the whole thing might have actually been a media hoax so on one hand you gotta kinda go lol that's funny good job you got the press but on the other hand to your loyal customers who are kinda freaking out about are the games I bought still gonna work how am I gonna re-download these games you know your core fanbase is gonna feel a little bit used after something like this so it's like yes you get the exposure but at what cost I felt very used on Rob's network have you ever bought a game on good old games I didn't think so

897
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:26,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, SpazinatorPSN in our chatroom says, good old games, bad old decisions.

898
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And that could be accurate.

899
00:51:30,686 --> 00:51:33,429
[SPEAKER_10]: So... You alright?

900
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:35,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, nothing happened at all.

901
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:36,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're good over here.

902
00:51:36,982 --> 00:51:37,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, good to hear it.

903
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:39,784
[SPEAKER_09]: The cord definitely didn't fall out of the microphone.

904
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:41,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, nope, it stayed intact.

905
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:41,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

906
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what do you think?

907
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:50,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know you probably weren't a big advocate of this site in the first place, but what do you think about this as a marketing trick?

908
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,113
[SPEAKER_09]: As a marketing trick?

909
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:57,238
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool that we're all talking about you, and then when you come back, you're like, ah, no, we're not really going away.

910
00:51:57,258 --> 00:51:59,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's like, okay, no, we're not talking about you anymore.

911
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:00,301
[SPEAKER_09]: No one cares.

912
00:52:01,172 --> 00:52:21,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm I think it's in terms of marketing because keep in mind there is no such thing as bad press really yeah it gets people talking here's my suggestion and I know there's a handful of sites out there that listen to our show for inspiration I'm sure not to trash us on their blog every week but here's the thing

913
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:36,661
[SPEAKER_10]: If you cover the story about them shutting down and you want to really get revenge on these guys and their little marketing tricks and how they're using you basically to get free advertising for their site, cover the story about them shutting down and don't cover the story about them reopening.

914
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And then punch them in the dick.

915
00:52:39,882 --> 00:52:41,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy will be like, Olay!

916
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:42,864
[SPEAKER_03]: My dick.

917
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:43,465
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want.

918
00:52:44,685 --> 00:52:45,506
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, seriously.

919
00:52:46,046 --> 00:52:49,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if nobody covers the story about them reopening...

920
00:52:50,996 --> 00:52:53,698
[SPEAKER_10]: This little marketing thing kind of bit him in the ass, didn't it?

921
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:55,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Food for thought.

922
00:52:56,379 --> 00:53:03,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I know if I ran a website such as the aforementioned Kotaku or Joystick, I just wouldn't run... I would say, you know, I'm not your little...

923
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not to be toyed with I'm not to be toyed with

924
00:53:30,171 --> 00:53:31,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

925
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:31,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

926
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:34,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Rob.

927
00:53:34,392 --> 00:53:35,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Bend over, shark.

928
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:36,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't show your age.

929
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:39,934
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, please, won't you help us change the subject?

930
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are other subjects, definitely.

931
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:46,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It was spoken, actually, it came up on Twitter.

932
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:57,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Katsuhiro Harada, who is the Tekken director guy, he posted on Twitter, TGS September 18th at Togeki booth, I'll announce something.

933
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Colon D.

934
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:01,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Smileface.

935
00:54:02,817 --> 00:54:05,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually don't know what it is yet.

936
00:54:06,438 --> 00:54:07,939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's second tag tournament two.

937
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:10,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

938
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:13,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Yuck.

939
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you not excited about Tekken Tag Tournament 2?

940
00:54:17,778 --> 00:54:20,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't excited about the first Tekken Tag Tournament.

941
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,801
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think that's what it ended up being.

942
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:23,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's right.

943
00:54:23,403 --> 00:54:24,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still have to play it.

944
00:54:25,084 --> 00:54:25,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's Tekken.

945
00:54:26,365 --> 00:54:26,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

946
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:34,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, wasn't there like in the 3D Street Fighter series, didn't you not like the first game but the second one was okay?

947
00:54:35,093 --> 00:54:35,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Things like that.

948
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:36,354
[SPEAKER_21]: And the EX ones?

949
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:36,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

950
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:39,236
They're alright.

951
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:42,519
I'm just not a big fan of the Tekken Tag Series.

952
00:54:44,693 --> 00:54:45,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa, your mic cut out.

953
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:47,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I didn't even realize we just had big dead air.

954
00:54:47,355 --> 00:54:48,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

955
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:49,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

956
00:54:49,796 --> 00:54:50,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So Tekken Tag.

957
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:51,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Tekken Tag.

958
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:56,260
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's better than the first one, then yeah, I won't be disappointed.

959
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,780
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

960
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,822
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was really not all that great.

961
00:54:59,322 --> 00:55:00,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for Tekken Bowl.

962
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:02,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's my thoughts on it.

963
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:13,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably just going to be, since they're developing a tag team tournament sort of engine for Tekken X Capcom, the Namco version of that,

964
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:15,192
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

965
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:32,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.

966
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently that game will be hitting Japanese arcades in 2011.

967
00:55:37,003 --> 00:55:50,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is an updated, I guess it is a follow-up, of course, to 1999's arcade original, updated with new roster and current-gen graphics engine.

968
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:52,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't say the U.S.

969
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:56,378
[SPEAKER_09]: version has been announced yet, but they have a nice little teaser trailer that's up right now.

970
00:55:56,618 --> 00:55:58,139
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you know they're going to have a US version?

971
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and if this is an arcade game, that's kind of good news, I guess.

972
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,641
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a few stories in the past few weeks about good news for arcade games, you know?

973
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:12,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they're getting some things that the consoles actually don't have just yet, although it's probably inevitable this comes out for consoles as well.

974
00:56:13,564 --> 00:56:17,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope it does, but I would really like to see.

975
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:21,347
[SPEAKER_05]: If it did get an arcade release in the US, you know I'd play it.

976
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I don't think if it does come out console-wise, it's not going to take that long to port it over.

977
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like I said, they're building an engine already for the Tekken X Capcom game.

978
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Street Fighter, I guess.

979
00:56:42,037 --> 00:56:43,799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be the same damn engine, I know it.

980
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:48,844
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom, says it actually looks like the same system as Tekken across Capcom.

981
00:56:49,304 --> 00:57:05,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, see, that's the sad thing, though, is since they have that game coming out, it's like, you know, I could play that game, but I'd rather play the Capcom one, or not the Capcom, the Street Fighter one, because it's got more variety of characters, and now you have this one.

982
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope they don't bring it out on console.

983
00:57:07,763 --> 00:57:09,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Just leave it in the arcade or something.

984
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:12,029
[SPEAKER_09]: But put all the characters though in the Street Fighter one too.

985
00:57:12,169 --> 00:57:12,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be kind of cool.

986
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:19,202
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's travel around the world and talk about some games that are coming out a whole lot sooner than Tekken Tag Tournament.

987
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:21,764
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, not a whole lot coming out in the U.S.

988
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,165
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually pretty light, but next week will be pretty nice.

989
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:27,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off, though, this week we have Swords on the Wii.

990
00:57:27,646 --> 00:57:28,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a sword fighting game.

991
00:57:30,227 --> 00:57:34,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like a re-release of a game called Chicken Blaster with a stupid shotgun with that.

992
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:35,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

993
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

994
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:39,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a chicken fighting game?

995
00:57:56,502 --> 00:57:57,103
[SPEAKER_04]: How could you?

996
00:57:57,263 --> 00:57:58,244
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong, sir.

997
00:57:58,464 --> 00:57:58,784
[SPEAKER_04]: You are wrong.

998
00:57:58,804 --> 00:57:59,865
[SPEAKER_10]: You just need Chicken Shooter.

999
00:58:00,566 --> 00:58:01,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicken Blaster, okay.

1000
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:02,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicken Shoot was the first game.

1001
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicken Blaster with your small shotgun.

1002
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it right.

1003
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:09,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Sid Meier's Civilization V coming out on PC.

1004
00:58:09,955 --> 00:58:10,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1005
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:16,061
[SPEAKER_09]: New Carnival games on the DS and the Wii.

1006
00:58:16,222 --> 00:58:17,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1007
00:58:18,324 --> 00:58:18,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like, what was it?

1008
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:50,578
[SPEAKER_09]: WorldGolf2011, that's also on PC, um, Patrician, I think that's, um, Patrician4 on PC, I have no idea what the hell that is, uh, Formula 1 2010, coming from, well, what was formerly Codemasters, now Warner Home Video Games, that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week, uh, let's see,

1009
00:58:52,118 --> 00:59:09,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue on the DS a tie in with the new movie coming out whoopty shit come on OLR listeners how many of you bought Fancy Nancy last week that's what I want to know ah Sony once again not quite getting it but high velocity bowling for Playstation 3

1010
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,700
[SPEAKER_09]: High Velocity Bullying.

1011
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you may remember this as the PlayStation Network title that came out originally at $10, probably now $5.

1012
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:19,503
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, guess what?

1013
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:21,544
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to pay $40 for this one now.

1014
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:22,944
[SPEAKER_10]: But this one has move support, right?

1015
00:59:23,004 --> 00:59:24,305
[SPEAKER_09]: It does have move support.

1016
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:27,366
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the old one was getting patched for move support, I think.

1017
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:31,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong, but that would be ironic if that was the case.

1018
00:59:32,228 --> 00:59:37,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allan Poe conspiracy for the DS.

1019
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,569
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1020
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Farm Frenzy.

1021
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:40,572
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1022
00:59:40,672 --> 00:59:44,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I was about to make the same joke I know I made on this show like four weeks ago.

1023
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:49,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So this game had to have gotten pushed back because I was going to say, I will buy that game, Quoth the Raven, nevermore.

1024
00:59:50,182 --> 00:59:50,602
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1025
00:59:50,783 --> 00:59:54,406
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I made that joke four weeks ago and you all groaned then too.

1026
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:55,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaving.

1027
00:59:56,629 --> 01:00:08,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Farm Frenzy, Animal Country Club Penguin, Game Day for the Wii Gormiti, The Lords of Nature Jewels of the Tropical Lost Island

1028
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,912
[SPEAKER_03]: God, this game list is shitty as fuck, man.

1029
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:25,675
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the great thing, is that Loki, like whenever we do the US release dates, he'll be like, yeah, you know, Halo's coming out this week.

1030
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:28,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have on the DS, Fancy Nancy.

1031
01:00:30,118 --> 01:00:35,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks like we've got Jewel Questathon and Chicken Shoots coming out on the Wii.

1032
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,782
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but that's my point, though.

1033
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:40,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been waiting for like two years for like good games to start coming out on the Wii again.

1034
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:42,525
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm like, okay, Zelda's coming out next year.

1035
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,265
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1036
01:00:43,365 --> 01:00:45,847
[SPEAKER_06]: You can come over and play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom with me.

1037
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:47,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's on the Wii.

1038
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I played that.

1039
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,190
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a fun game.

1040
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,031
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Epic Yarn?

1041
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:52,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's not out yet.

1042
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:53,151
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's what I mean.

1043
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,971
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not out yet, and that looks like a good game.

1044
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:55,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

1045
01:00:55,312 --> 01:00:56,852
[SPEAKER_18]: That does not sound like Fancy Nancy.

1046
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:58,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But before that, Wii Party.

1047
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:06,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that they actually got the idea for the Kirby game from an old Kirby commercial that Nintendo had made using Yarn?

1048
01:01:06,714 --> 01:01:13,815
[SPEAKER_09]: There is some decent stuff coming out this week, and we're also going to end with some crappy stuff, as if we haven't already.

1049
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:35,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Etrian Odyssey 3 The Drowned City on DS Final Fantasy 14 The Collector's Edition coming out on PC this week I think you get that earlier than the regular version I guess that's special Wait, and how much are you going to pay for Final Fantasy 14 to play it early?

1050
01:01:35,545 --> 01:01:37,666
[SPEAKER_09]: $75 Good lord!

1051
01:01:39,907 --> 01:01:41,008
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money

1052
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:46,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Also this week, Darksiders on PC.

1053
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that's it.

1054
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:14,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I take a tangent for a minute?

1055
01:02:15,046 --> 01:02:19,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Tangent train, this actually absolutely 100% has nothing to do with video games whatsoever.

1056
01:02:19,988 --> 01:02:21,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But it does have to do with strippers.

1057
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:22,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes, you can.

1058
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:30,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I went out clubbing last night with Alan and we met some mutual friends and met up for dinner and went to one of the bars downtown.

1059
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:35,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were sitting at a table that is right by the window.

1060
01:02:36,195 --> 01:02:38,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can look out onto the street and see what's going on.

1061
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:39,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And we watched this.

1062
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:51,551
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a really popular gay bar across the street where all the little circuit boys and all their little women that want to go see the horny guys and stuff.

1063
01:02:51,671 --> 01:02:54,654
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the club they all go to that I outgrew many, many, many years ago.

1064
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:55,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what you're talking about.

1065
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:56,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you know exactly which place I'm talking about.

1066
01:02:56,997 --> 01:02:58,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone who lives in Sacramento knows what club I'm talking about.

1067
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:20,789
[SPEAKER_10]: so we are sitting at the place across the street looking out the window and we see this gigantic bus pull up in front of it and inside the bus is like all these disco lights and like green neon lights going on and we look carefully in the bus there's a stripper pole inside the bus that's awesome and I'm like

1068
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:22,551
[SPEAKER_10]: What in the hell is that?

1069
01:03:22,691 --> 01:03:27,177
[SPEAKER_10]: And my friend speaks up, I don't remember if it was Alan or my friend, says, oh, it's one of those stripper buses.

1070
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1071
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:31,283
[SPEAKER_10]: They have that now?

1072
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:35,266
[SPEAKER_10]: They have traveling... Put on your seatbelt!

1073
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just strap yourself to the pole.

1074
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:38,669
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that work?

1075
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:40,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, it's not a stripper bus.

1076
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,050
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a limo bus.

1077
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:44,073
[SPEAKER_09]: This is funny.

1078
01:03:44,473 --> 01:03:48,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, we did our Game Summit thing.

1079
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:54,401
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the days we went out, they took us to a few wineries and they did wine tasting.

1080
01:03:54,921 --> 01:03:57,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they had two different limo buses.

1081
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:59,326
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a shorter one, and then they had a larger one.

1082
01:03:59,447 --> 01:04:01,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the larger one had a stripper pole in the back.

1083
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,032
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just a bus.

1084
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:06,895
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean... Hold on, hold on.

1085
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:09,779
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to talk about party bus, we need party bus music.

1086
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilliant, I approve.

1087
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:21,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so they do have a stripper pool in the back, and I suppose if you were to rent it, say for a bachelor party or something, you could have strippers performing.

1088
01:04:22,643 --> 01:04:28,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Now granted, it might not be the safest thing for them to be doing, but sure, why not?

1089
01:04:28,846 --> 01:04:44,231
[SPEAKER_10]: So, finally the lights go on in this bus and there's like, I shit you not, like 50 drunk chicks all piled in this bus and it's like the lights went on at the club at 2am and they all just start pouring out the front of the bus and go on in the little gay club.

1090
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:45,131
Okay.

1091
01:04:47,232 --> 01:04:57,135
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I stopped going to that club also, Rob, because every Friday and Saturday night it's like, let's let all the straights in and there was like two gay people there and I was like, what is going on?

1092
01:04:57,195 --> 01:04:57,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Like...

1093
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:10,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been there in like six years now.

1094
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:12,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but I was just fascinated.

1095
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:19,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what if that bus, I mean that bus was a big bus and it was taking up an entire lane and surely it doesn't turn well.

1096
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:22,196
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just thinking like what if that bus gets in an accident?

1097
01:05:22,476 --> 01:05:26,038
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have just drunk chicks pouring out the windshield.

1098
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:26,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

1099
01:05:26,918 --> 01:05:28,539
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1100
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:31,461
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't know because they're drunk so it doesn't matter.

1101
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:37,545
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a terrible thing, having a bunch of drunk chicks inside of a bus with a stripper pole.

1102
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:39,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeez, that would suck.

1103
01:05:39,887 --> 01:05:43,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, and then all the skanky, slutty twink boys that you were nice enough to call the stripper boys.

1104
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:47,934
[SPEAKER_18]: All the skanky, slutty, snotty twink boys that are faces won't even know because they'll just be like, whatever.

1105
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:54,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how I went out of my way to not give the clubs names and then you're just like... Oh, this is interesting.

1106
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Tiger Call linked us a picture here in chat of a stripper bus.

1107
01:05:58,423 --> 01:05:59,964
[SPEAKER_10]: This must be in Nevada.

1108
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:02,845
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an advertisement, yeah.

1109
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:04,926
[SPEAKER_10]: It was close to that, though.

1110
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:06,447
[SPEAKER_10]: It was close to that.

1111
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:09,648
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looked a little bit more like a regular stripper bus.

1112
01:06:09,688 --> 01:06:10,649
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like a billboard.

1113
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:12,289
[SPEAKER_03]: A regular stripper bus.

1114
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:17,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's making distinctions between types of buses.

1115
01:06:17,872 --> 01:06:18,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1116
01:06:18,272 --> 01:06:18,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1117
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:20,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1118
01:06:20,673 --> 01:06:22,454
[SPEAKER_10]: We should go to Japanese release dates, shouldn't we?

1119
01:06:22,474 --> 01:06:46,546
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a stripper pole, that's just a pole so that you don't fall over Yeah, you hold on to it, you know In lieu of a seatbelt, you know Alright, let's go to the Japanese release dates We're gonna make them a little more interesting tonight God's gonna read them in Korean Beep beep, here come your Japanese release dates

1120
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:54,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Devil May Cry 4 gets a price reduction in Japan September 22nd.

1121
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Singularity makes its way out to the Xbox 360 in Japan.

1122
01:06:58,675 --> 01:07:03,778
[SPEAKER_10]: That of course being the localized version of the Activision game that I believe came out here a little while ago.

1123
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,000
[SPEAKER_10]: The party keeps on rolling onto the PlayStation 3.

1124
01:07:10,436 --> 01:07:11,057
[SPEAKER_10]: at some point.

1125
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:13,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, there's a lot of games coming out on the Xbox 360 soon.

1126
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:19,888
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3 gets Devil May Cry 4, price reduction there as well, and Singularity, as well as winning Post 7 2010.

1127
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:25,223
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1128
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Jacka Jacka Music Jacka Jacka Music

1129
01:08:07,308 --> 01:08:09,249
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but I'm going to go jack-a-jack all night long.

1130
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:10,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to look at the music.

1131
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,652
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's just showing you chords.

1132
01:08:15,553 --> 01:08:17,314
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks really boring, actually.

1133
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:19,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd fall asleep playing jack-a-jack music.

1134
01:08:19,215 --> 01:08:21,597
[SPEAKER_21]: False advertising, man.

1135
01:08:21,657 --> 01:08:22,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I get it.

1136
01:08:22,818 --> 01:08:25,639
[SPEAKER_10]: If you jack-a-jack-a before bed, you'll fall asleep easier.

1137
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:29,021
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

1138
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:32,303
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a pervert, Rob.

1139
01:08:33,084 --> 01:08:34,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the Sony PSP this week...

1140
01:08:43,482 --> 01:08:46,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I shit you not, that's the name of the game.

1141
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:48,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Three-way standoff.

1142
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, three-way, eh?

1143
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:57,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1144
01:08:58,599 --> 01:08:59,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's having a moment.

1145
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Comes out this week.

1146
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:03,523
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about school kids.

1147
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:07,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's three-way action here.

1148
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:08,326
[SPEAKER_09]: It always is.

1149
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:10,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Rob.

1150
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:11,428
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so experimental.

1151
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:14,250
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other PSP games coming out, but I'm done.

1152
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:14,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not.

1153
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:15,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Do-ra-ra-ra.

1154
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:16,271
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1155
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:18,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not done until we... No, I closed it.

1156
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:22,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because I have a good name for you, Rob, for something that comes out on the 22nd.

1157
01:09:23,176 --> 01:09:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Death Spank Thongs of Virtue.

1158
01:09:24,997 --> 01:09:26,858
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like an awesome game.

1159
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:28,740
[SPEAKER_10]: For our UK releases.

1160
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,861
[SPEAKER_10]: The chatters are pointing out Do-ra-ra-ra is an anime.

1161
01:09:33,108 --> 01:09:58,826
[SPEAKER_05]: About three-way sex amongst school children On the 24th, we have Blue Dragon, Awaken Shadow on the DS Darksiders for PC, Dead Rising 2 Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock Lost Horizon, Quantum Theory I just like that name, Quantum Theory Sid Meier's Civilization V for PC Test Drive Unlimited 2 and Trackmania 2, all for PC

1162
01:10:01,169 --> 01:10:03,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, Navy Seals.

1163
01:10:06,472 --> 01:10:06,833
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1164
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:08,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we ready to get back into some gaming news?

1165
01:10:08,874 --> 01:10:09,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1166
01:10:09,634 --> 01:10:16,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first I'm going to derail the show again because Alan said I have to play this link on air because it has to do with the stripper bus.

1167
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:20,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a video from TheOnion.com.

1168
01:10:21,581 --> 01:10:22,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1169
01:10:22,262 --> 01:10:23,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I only know where this is going to go.

1170
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:25,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this is coming from TheOnion.com.

1171
01:10:27,064 --> 01:10:31,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me stop you real quick, because you did miss one since you didn't want to talk about it.

1172
01:10:31,787 --> 01:10:32,688
[SPEAKER_09]: What did I miss?

1173
01:10:33,468 --> 01:10:39,732
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Ryuga Gotoku Shinshou.

1174
01:10:40,692 --> 01:10:44,555
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the... Oh, great, and now I can't remember the damn title.

1175
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:49,577
[SPEAKER_09]: The Yakuza on the PSP came out this week as well.

1176
01:10:49,658 --> 01:10:52,019
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little bit of a big title for Japan.

1177
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I talk about the stripper bus again?

1178
01:10:55,061 --> 01:10:56,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, talk about the stripper bus.

1179
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,205
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're just joining us, we are covering a developing story.

1180
01:11:02,245 --> 01:11:11,451
[SPEAKER_14]: We go back now to Southern California where a VH1 bus crashed just a short while ago, spilling more than 2,000 pounds of slut onto interstate five-year Palmdale.

1181
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:20,636
[SPEAKER_14]: The bus was transporting contestants for the new VH1 reality series, The Road to Knoxville, in which 18 scantily clad young women vie for the heart of divorced stuntman Johnny Knoxville.

1182
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:28,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Officials there are struggling to control the spread of slut, which has already polluted the roadway and is spreading now down a hillside into residential areas.

1183
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:32,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go live to Onion News Network's Brian Scott, who's live on the scene.

1184
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:34,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Brian, what's exactly going on out there?

1185
01:11:34,684 --> 01:11:36,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's just horrible, Anna.

1186
01:11:36,165 --> 01:11:41,709
[SPEAKER_08]: The highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of this orange-skinned slut.

1187
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:42,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only been here an hour.

1188
01:11:43,009 --> 01:11:47,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already seen four three-way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings.

1189
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:52,154
[SPEAKER_08]: and Downwind, the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.

1190
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:53,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like quite a scene.

1191
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:58,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington Beach early this morning, is that right?

1192
01:11:58,378 --> 01:11:59,498
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where it began, yes.

1193
01:11:59,538 --> 01:12:06,862
[SPEAKER_08]: The sluts were being transported from a negligee-wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl-on-girl paintball match when the crash occurred.

1194
01:12:07,242 --> 01:12:14,308
[SPEAKER_08]: In speculation, in fact, the accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on the vehicle and getting on the driver.

1195
01:12:14,348 --> 01:12:18,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the local fire department is just not equipped to handle something this toxic.

1196
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:26,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel River and officials are concerned that the sluts might go skinny dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in it.

1197
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:29,500
[SPEAKER_08]: But we should say, too, that the crews, they're doing their best.

1198
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:35,745
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip-offs and shooter contests in the ditch behind me.

1199
01:12:35,845 --> 01:12:38,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we've just gotten word that VH1 has issued a statement.

1200
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:39,086
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on their website.

1201
01:12:39,386 --> 01:12:42,108
[SPEAKER_14]: It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts.

1202
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:48,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but the EPA has urged VH1 to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly concentrated slut they use now.

1203
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:52,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1's going to ever go for that.

1204
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:54,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan, stay safe out there, and don't fuck any of those sluts.

1205
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:55,433
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thanks, Iowa.

1206
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:59,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on, a new Apple laptop has become preloaded with a half-written coming-of-age novel.

1207
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:02,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love The Onion.

1208
01:13:04,376 --> 01:13:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see the one they did about... You have to understand, that was what we saw last night.

1209
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:12,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here in Sacramento.

1210
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:13,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Rob, we get it.

1211
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:13,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1212
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I love The Onion, too.

1213
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:16,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, too.

1214
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:21,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the one about the impending flood from Folsom Dam and then creating the memorial for it?

1215
01:13:22,043 --> 01:13:22,283
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1216
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:26,224
[SPEAKER_05]: and talking to the first person who dies in the flood.

1217
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:28,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, you know what's funny?

1218
01:13:28,706 --> 01:13:32,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Matt and I, the old apartment we lived at, I mean, we can say this now because we don't live there anymore.

1219
01:13:33,068 --> 01:13:35,149
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to live in an apartment, the old studio.

1220
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:38,750
[SPEAKER_10]: This was the studio from about episodes, what, about 50 to probably like 150?

1221
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:43,753
[SPEAKER_10]: We're taped at the apartment where Loki and I used to live together, which was right next to Folsom Dam.

1222
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:45,153
[SPEAKER_10]: We lived in this little apartment complex.

1223
01:13:45,173 --> 01:13:46,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It was literally right next to it.

1224
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:52,277
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, if that dam ever broke, we'd be looking down on all the people getting flooded out because we were on top of the hill.

1225
01:13:52,657 --> 01:13:54,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, poor people.

1226
01:13:54,218 --> 01:13:56,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Good one, Rob.

1227
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you have so much concern for other people.

1228
01:13:59,622 --> 01:14:00,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, video games!

1229
01:14:00,863 --> 01:14:01,264
[SPEAKER_10]: News!

1230
01:14:01,324 --> 01:14:01,984
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1231
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:02,965
[SPEAKER_10]: What are those?

1232
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:03,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Video games.

1233
01:14:04,686 --> 01:14:05,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

1234
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:05,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1235
01:14:06,107 --> 01:14:07,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about games.

1236
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:15,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Nielsen, the wonderful agency that talks about different ads and entertainment trends...

1237
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:27,663
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a study of the six EA Sports titles, including NHL 10, NBA Live 09, that had in-game advertisements in them.

1238
01:14:28,003 --> 01:14:35,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess, apparently, they increased household dollars spent on different things by 24%.

1239
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:40,651
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them that they looked at was Gatorade, and that was, I guess, the case there.

1240
01:14:41,872 --> 01:14:42,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

1241
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:43,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't...

1242
01:14:45,255 --> 01:14:45,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1243
01:14:45,635 --> 01:14:52,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy that people, you know, if they see Gatorade on a billboard in the background, that they're going to really go and buy Gatorade.

1244
01:14:52,600 --> 01:15:05,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of players that play sports games for a long period of time, maybe perhaps like drinking, you know, Gatorade or soda or whatever, and it's just a coincidence, if you ask me.

1245
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:11,996
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently they have a press release out and summarizing the different things, but...

1246
01:15:13,862 --> 01:15:17,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, like, if they cover Axe Body Spray or something like that.

1247
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:18,868
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be interesting.

1248
01:15:19,168 --> 01:15:28,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Nielsen's been running studies on our show here at Orange Lounge Radio, and it's showing that after tonight's episode, it looks like we had an increase.

1249
01:15:29,219 --> 01:15:32,242
[SPEAKER_10]: 33% of our listeners decided to go to Six Flags after tonight's show.

1250
01:15:32,323 --> 01:15:33,444
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something else.

1251
01:15:33,464 --> 01:15:34,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something else.

1252
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'll stop.

1253
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:49,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, they said out of, I guess, the panel of 100,000 households representing the U.S.

1254
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:53,295
[SPEAKER_09]: population according to their home scan panel or whatever,

1255
01:15:53,775 --> 01:15:57,497
[SPEAKER_09]: It says scanned video game UPC barcodes.

1256
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:01,780
[SPEAKER_09]: The scanned barcodes were then matched to a reference library of more than 14,000 video games.

1257
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:17,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Nielsen compared the households that purchased the least of one of the studied games before and after the Gatorade branding was integrated into the games, the test group, with the households that didn't purchase one of the games, the control group.

1258
01:16:17,709 --> 01:16:20,311
[SPEAKER_09]: It says the test and control groups are projected out abroad

1259
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:46,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah blah, see here it says, well overall they noticed that there was a 24% increase in sales after that So, you know what you just did, you just opened the floodgates for them to like, you know, put in all sorts of ridiculous stuff Way to go Nielsen And trust me, it's gonna get ridiculous as we will get to in part B Oh goody Ridiculously cool though I have to say, so uh

1260
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:47,350
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1261
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:54,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, I think when we do talk about this, this is how you do the advertisement because it's fucking awesome.

1262
01:16:56,281 --> 01:16:57,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you got me all curious.

1263
01:16:58,043 --> 01:16:58,383
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1264
01:16:59,305 --> 01:17:00,806
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be talking about Sega game.

1265
01:17:01,347 --> 01:17:01,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, goody.

1266
01:17:02,298 --> 01:17:03,099
[SPEAKER_10]: KONAMI & HARMONIX

1267
01:17:21,519 --> 01:17:23,440
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a lawsuit launched by Konami.

1268
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:30,342
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a filing in a federal court in Texas this week, and the two parties agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims.

1269
01:17:30,822 --> 01:17:40,766
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a suit over Harmonix's Rock Band infringing on patents that were owned by Konami because, of course, Konami had Guitar Freaks many years ago, etc., etc.

1270
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Band supposedly had copies of that.

1271
01:17:43,606 --> 01:17:47,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember they said Rock Revolution failed because of the Rock Band 2 stuff?

1272
01:17:47,908 --> 01:17:49,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, among other things.

1273
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:50,809
[SPEAKER_10]: That was maybe like...

1274
01:17:52,307 --> 01:17:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there tongue?

1275
01:18:14,296 --> 01:18:16,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We will not know because it's sealed, okay?

1276
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:41,464
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be playing this game.

1277
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,826
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was your age, I was playing this.

1278
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the classic video game of the week, DarkSakura, what should they be playing?

1279
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:53,052
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Super Mario Bros.

1280
01:18:53,072 --> 01:18:53,052
2.

1281
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:53,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

1282
01:18:54,673 --> 01:19:02,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, I actually have to thank Tiara for suggesting Super Mario Bros., but I wanted to do Super Mario Bros.

1283
01:19:02,278 --> 01:19:02,258
2.

1284
01:19:02,378 --> 01:19:05,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually surprised you have never picked this before, but you haven't.

1285
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,022
[SPEAKER_10]: You've done three, but never two.

1286
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:08,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Bros.

1287
01:19:08,883 --> 01:19:10,385
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 wasn't actually a Super Mario Bros.

1288
01:19:10,405 --> 01:19:11,025
[SPEAKER_05]: game originally.

1289
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called You May Call Joe Doki Doki Panic, which was also on the Famicom Disk System and had an intro and an ending.

1290
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,335
[SPEAKER_10]: But the intro music sounds very familiar.

1291
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:22,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1292
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:26,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so cute.

1293
01:19:27,406 --> 01:19:28,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, the kids get sucked into a book.

1294
01:19:29,929 --> 01:19:31,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Little monkey boy is running away.

1295
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:33,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know what the little monkey is about.

1296
01:19:33,413 --> 01:19:34,053
[SPEAKER_05]: He just is there.

1297
01:19:34,494 --> 01:19:37,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, we four people are randomly showing up in these children's bedroom.

1298
01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:39,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's jump into the book.

1299
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Not creepy at all.

1300
01:19:41,122 --> 01:19:41,162
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1301
01:19:42,703 --> 01:19:44,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's flip the disc over.

1302
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like I said, Famicom disc.

1303
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:48,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, um... What do you want to hear?

1304
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Doki Doki Panic music?

1305
01:19:50,311 --> 01:19:51,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

1306
01:19:51,332 --> 01:19:51,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

1307
01:19:51,872 --> 01:20:01,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, it's funny, some of the sound effects are different, and they did other sprite swaps, like these weird-looking head things were there, but they turned them into mushrooms.

1308
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:10,254
[SPEAKER_09]: and, yeah, this one, um... So you pulled heads out of the grounds instead of, like, you know... No.

1309
01:20:10,294 --> 01:20:11,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that'd be really cool.

1310
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:12,698
[SPEAKER_05]: You pulled the vegetables out.

1311
01:20:12,718 --> 01:20:14,681
[SPEAKER_09]: You pulled severed heads out of the ground instead of vegetables.

1312
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:18,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like these masks are sitting there instead of the mushroom blocks.

1313
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:25,536
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, the whole thought that Nintendo had was that the original Super Mario Bros.

1314
01:20:25,556 --> 01:20:29,241
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 that came out in 1986 was too hard.

1315
01:20:29,761 --> 01:20:31,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, American players!

1316
01:20:31,884 --> 01:20:35,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is stupid because Japanese RPGs are ridiculously easy to start off.

1317
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever play Final Fantasy 7 in Japanese?

1318
01:20:39,393 --> 01:20:40,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking easy!

1319
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:42,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hit dead, hit dead.

1320
01:20:43,578 --> 01:20:46,963
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is very, very hard, the original Super Mario game.

1321
01:20:47,023 --> 01:20:53,491
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mario, when it came out as lost levels here on the Super Nintendo cartridge, the All-Stars or whatever, it was really hard.

1322
01:20:54,232 --> 01:20:56,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Beat it eventually, but it was a hard game.

1323
01:20:57,757 --> 01:21:09,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um, so what they did is, um, they took, uh, Doki Doki Panic and they, uh, I guess re-sprited it with the main characters and changed a few things.

1324
01:21:09,348 --> 01:21:17,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they, because I guess there was more capacity to do stuff on the cartridge, they, um, they actually just, uh,

1325
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:20,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Could put in some more graphical elements.

1326
01:21:20,283 --> 01:21:28,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, one thing that you'll notice listening to the two different tracks is because the sound processor is just a little bit different for the games on disc versus the games.

1327
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:33,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you ever listen to Legend of Zelda on disc from the disc system, the music sounds different.

1328
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:37,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's the same music, but it uses different instrumentation.

1329
01:21:37,808 --> 01:21:38,168
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

1330
01:21:38,668 --> 01:21:39,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And different sound effects.

1331
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the bird thing squawks differently.

1332
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't have the bonus game.

1333
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:47,851
[SPEAKER_05]: That has a different looking bonus game.

1334
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:58,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so they did this because they thought it would be more popular and that it would be fun and easy.

1335
01:21:59,322 --> 01:22:08,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, it actually came out in Japan in 1992 as Super Mario USA, which came out with Super Mario All-Stars.

1336
01:22:08,332 --> 01:22:09,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So we each got something fun.

1337
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:19,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but so yeah, you walk around and you throw potions down, which in the original, in the Doki Doki Panic, it's magic lamps.

1338
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:25,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has sort of this, I guess, Arabian Nights kind of theme in all these other levels.

1339
01:22:26,104 --> 01:22:32,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But you get your power-ups by going into these little reverse universe things and...

1340
01:22:32,808 --> 01:22:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: In Super Mario 2, of course our US one, you can play as Mario, who is the all-around average dude, or Luigi, who is... I always called him Crazy Legs Dude, because his legs spin, but he jumps higher than anybody else.

1341
01:22:49,995 --> 01:22:52,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can play Toad, who, by the way, is not useless.

1342
01:22:52,215 --> 01:22:56,537
[SPEAKER_05]: You play Toad when you need to dig a lot, because he digs faster.

1343
01:22:57,397 --> 01:22:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Or when you're trying to get those extra power-ups.

1344
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:01,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Who was a chick in Doki Doki Panic, right?

1345
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:01,315
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1346
01:23:02,115 --> 01:23:05,416
[SPEAKER_10]: The blue character was a girl, wasn't it?

1347
01:23:05,436 --> 01:23:06,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But that wasn't Toad.

1348
01:23:06,516 --> 01:23:07,056
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Mario.

1349
01:23:07,436 --> 01:23:08,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my bad.

1350
01:23:08,796 --> 01:23:09,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1351
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:14,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got Princess, who is the pink chick with the hair and pants in the Doki Doki Panic.

1352
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:16,679
[SPEAKER_05]: But she can float, though.

1353
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:18,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, she can float.

1354
01:23:19,779 --> 01:23:20,860
[SPEAKER_05]: But Toad can't jump for shit.

1355
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:25,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you get POW blocks, which blow up things, and they're really fun.

1356
01:23:26,441 --> 01:23:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: and it had a life meter which was unique for Mario game you know instead of your different sizes but it was really stupid because like if you lose one of your your little segments there then you have to kill like a certain number of enemies so that you can get a heart to come up and then you you know whatever

1357
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:48,747
[SPEAKER_05]: You will refill it.

1358
01:23:49,587 --> 01:23:50,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, to get your star.

1359
01:23:51,468 --> 01:23:56,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to thank the irate gamer for this analogy because it was spot on.

1360
01:23:58,112 --> 01:24:02,235
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get like five cherries and then your star will show up for your invincibility.

1361
01:24:02,655 --> 01:24:06,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Except it takes forever to get to where you are unless you're at the very bottom of the screen.

1362
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:11,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way he described it, you have time to take a shit before the star arrives, which he proceeded to do.

1363
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to thank him for demonstrating that.

1364
01:24:14,902 --> 01:24:15,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

1365
01:24:15,843 --> 01:24:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1366
01:24:18,335 --> 01:24:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, if you pull up the little plants in the little reversed universe, then you get coins, which you can use for a bonus game, which is basically like slots.

1367
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:35,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a pattern to it, and I used to always be able to get the pattern where you'd always get them to match.

1368
01:24:36,293 --> 01:24:40,377
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like if you hit the button really fast, you could usually win it.

1369
01:24:41,038 --> 01:24:42,039
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like...

1370
01:24:44,577 --> 01:24:48,119
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it was like you hit one and then you hit the next two twice as fast.

1371
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,862
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a da-da-da was my rhythm.

1372
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:55,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always got it.

1373
01:24:56,504 --> 01:24:59,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess it depends.

1374
01:25:00,186 --> 01:25:04,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if you also hit the button really right away, like after you've gotten a cherry, then you'll always get a cherry on the next one.

1375
01:25:07,153 --> 01:25:09,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would have like 50 million lives by the time I was done.

1376
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:17,218
[SPEAKER_05]: You've also got little warp zones where if you throw your little jar at the right spot, it goes down.

1377
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, you got audio issues going on.

1378
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Were the warp zones in Doki Doki Panic?

1379
01:25:23,101 --> 01:25:23,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they were.

1380
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:24,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1381
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:29,543
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, if you watch the playthrough, because I linked a playthrough for Doki Doki Panic.

1382
01:25:29,563 --> 01:25:31,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is all you need to see of Doki Doki Panic, really.

1383
01:25:31,444 --> 01:25:32,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It really wasn't the better game.

1384
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:38,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, a lot of people are like, oh, you know, it was the original, but they made improvements when they brought it over here.

1385
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:42,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, keep in mind, they had more, if I'm right, they had more storage capacity.

1386
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:52,409
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that we're missing is the dinky little intro, which you had to flip the disc anyway to start off with, and then flip to play the game, and then flip to go back, and flip and flip and flip, and whatever.

1387
01:25:52,429 --> 01:25:53,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I got tired of flipping off.

1388
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, all the warps and everything were there.

1389
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:00,871
[SPEAKER_05]: You just throw them where there's a particular jar, you go down the jar, boom, you're somewhere else.

1390
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:03,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And I loved this little trick for, was it 6-1?

1391
01:26:03,352 --> 01:26:03,372
[SPEAKER_05]: 6-1.

1392
01:26:04,651 --> 01:26:05,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so yeah, uh,

1393
01:26:34,514 --> 01:26:41,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It was... They actually were planning on releasing Doki Doki Panic in the U.S.

1394
01:26:41,484 --> 01:26:44,148
[SPEAKER_05]: at some point, but they actually just didn't.

1395
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:47,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they, you know...

1396
01:26:49,714 --> 01:26:58,559
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing about this though is that the reason why it does kind of fit in musically and with sound effects is because the soundtrack was composed by Koji Kondo.

1397
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1398
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:08,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting to me like how much this ended up kind of just becoming a part of the Mario mythos, if you will.

1399
01:27:08,305 --> 01:27:16,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, later Mario games had some of these characters that first appeared in really Doki Doki Panic kind of crossed over into the Mario universe, especially like some of the

1400
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:17,271
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1401
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:46,822
[SPEAKER_10]: as much as you might want to think Nintendo was kind of rude for dumbing it down it really worked for them it did on multiple levels in this case it was interesting to me though just real quick sorry I know you have more you want to say but it was really interesting to me how this game really fit into the

1402
01:27:47,422 --> 01:27:52,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Very odd 8-bit sequels that were nothing like the originals in many ways.

1403
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:56,909
[SPEAKER_10]: You had this, you had Castlevania II Simon's Quest, which was a huge departure from the original.

1404
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda II was a huge departure from the original.

1405
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:04,075
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very interesting how a lot of games were so different back then.

1406
01:28:04,535 --> 01:28:06,157
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this ostrich thing spitting eggs at me?

1407
01:28:06,177 --> 01:28:06,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I liked it.

1408
01:28:35,812 --> 01:28:41,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so at any rate, um, we, uh, later on there were the re-releases.

1409
01:28:41,919 --> 01:28:44,703
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Super Mario All-Stars, which was really sweet.

1410
01:28:45,544 --> 01:28:50,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, there was, uh, you remember the Satellaview?

1411
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:55,255
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Gaiden version that was, um, Super Mario All-Stars on Satellaview.

1412
01:28:57,049 --> 01:29:05,081
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was called BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge and so it ran in weekly volumes like all the other Satellaview games.

1413
01:29:06,103 --> 01:29:09,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got Super Mario Advance which was...

1414
01:29:12,099 --> 01:29:13,541
[SPEAKER_05]: The Super Mario Bros.

1415
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:21,188
[SPEAKER_05]: 2, which actually was a lot harder, but it had some innovations that kept the game fresh, I think, for a lot of people.

1416
01:29:21,509 --> 01:29:22,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked it.

1417
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:34,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's Super Mario 2, or as the original was, because I think I'd have to lump the games together, is that it was...

1418
01:29:36,058 --> 01:29:37,618
[SPEAKER_05]: and Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

1419
01:29:37,898 --> 01:29:46,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, since I'm talking about that too, they did a Mario-style poster based off of the original cover for Doki Doki Panic.

1420
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:56,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And the characters that were in there was... I just want to point out, in the time you've been talking, someone beat Mario 2 here on YouTube.

1421
01:29:56,803 --> 01:29:57,563
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty amazing.

1422
01:29:57,763 --> 01:29:58,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I was...

1423
01:30:00,342 --> 01:30:01,383
[SPEAKER_10]: You cut out again.

1424
01:30:01,403 --> 01:30:03,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That mic is getting dated.

1425
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:05,266
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the mic is new.

1426
01:30:05,326 --> 01:30:06,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a new cord.

1427
01:30:07,107 --> 01:30:12,271
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, Imogene was one of the little toad-looking characters.

1428
01:30:12,912 --> 01:30:16,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was Mama, who was the one in the blue.

1429
01:30:16,394 --> 01:30:17,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Luigi.

1430
01:30:18,116 --> 01:30:22,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was Lena, who was the pink princess harem girl.

1431
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And Papa, who became Toad.

1432
01:30:30,074 --> 01:30:36,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And he actually, um... I think became a... No, I'm wrong.

1433
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:37,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget I said anything.

1434
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:38,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1435
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:39,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1436
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:42,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now here's the differences.

1437
01:30:42,222 --> 01:30:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Different title screen.

1438
01:30:43,984 --> 01:30:47,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the story takes place in a storybook instead of in the dream world.

1439
01:30:49,127 --> 01:30:53,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have a save feature because it was on the disk system.

1440
01:30:55,251 --> 01:30:57,093
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot run with the B button.

1441
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:06,578
[SPEAKER_05]: There are, like I said, different music changes, different graphical changes, and you need fewer hits to hit wart in Doki Doki Panic than in Super Mario 2.

1442
01:31:07,178 --> 01:31:18,105
[SPEAKER_05]: The waterfall is faster than in Super Mario 2, and of course different sound effects because of the number of pins between the Famicom disc and the full-size NES cartridges.

1443
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:19,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

1444
01:31:21,046 --> 01:31:22,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of a split one.

1445
01:31:22,247 --> 01:31:26,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Yumi Kojo, Doki Doki Panic, and Super Mario Bros. 2.

1446
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:28,942
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1447
01:31:29,523 --> 01:31:34,986
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Mario 2, here in the U.S.

1448
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:36,347
[SPEAKER_10]: or Doki Doki Panic overseas.

1449
01:31:36,948 --> 01:31:37,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Good pick.

1450
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:39,409
[SPEAKER_10]: One that I'm sure a lot of people remember.

1451
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:40,370
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1452
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:43,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1453
01:31:43,472 --> 01:31:44,312
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be right back.

1454
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,374
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty more to come tonight in Part B of our show.

1455
01:31:46,394 --> 01:31:49,035
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually going to get into some more of the news that's coming out of Tokyo Game Show.

1456
01:31:49,055 --> 01:31:50,336
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't do a lot this segment.

1457
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:51,517
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got plenty more to come.

1458
01:31:51,557 --> 01:31:52,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, your calls.

1459
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:56,262
[SPEAKER_10]: and tweets and emails of which I'm sure there's plenty.

1460
01:31:56,482 --> 01:31:59,185
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get to all those and more Rice Princess and the Doctor.

1461
01:31:59,766 --> 01:32:00,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1462
01:32:00,206 --> 01:32:00,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1463
01:32:00,987 --> 01:32:02,329
[SPEAKER_10]: If I don't kick them off the show.

1464
01:32:02,349 --> 01:32:02,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's going to happen.

1465
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:06,053
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now they'll be here to tell more poop jokes when we return.

1466
01:32:07,034 --> 01:32:09,037
[SPEAKER_10]: With more of Orange Lodge Radio right after this.

1467
01:32:15,123 --> 01:32:42,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And welcome back everybody to the second half of Orange Lounge Radio Live here at All Games Radio www.allgames.com where we do tape live every Sunday night 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show Going back over to DarkSakura for a minute here because she was talking about something during break that I thought was fascinating You mentioned you were telling Rice Princess about some documentary you've been watching lately It's not a documentary I'm watching a Japanese drama from 2006 called Gal Circle Uh-huh

1468
01:32:42,632 --> 01:32:48,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about these girls that are homeless and live in Shinjuku.

1469
01:32:48,877 --> 01:32:50,959
[SPEAKER_05]: They quit school to go be Parapara dancers.

1470
01:32:51,819 --> 01:32:55,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And they hang out in this warehouse and leech free food wherever they can find it.

1471
01:32:57,504 --> 01:32:59,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cute show, but one of the characters is...

1472
01:33:02,182 --> 01:33:02,783
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

1473
01:33:02,823 --> 01:33:09,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I'm listening to something coming from the living room that's like... Dan's watching the Angry Nintendo Nerd.

1474
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

1475
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:15,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so... But, like, the whole thing starts off with these U.S.

1476
01:33:15,936 --> 01:33:18,779
[SPEAKER_05]: troops dropping somebody on Shinjuku.

1477
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:22,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's this guy dressed up as a cowboy named Shinosuke.

1478
01:33:23,086 --> 01:33:23,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Outro Music

1479
01:33:37,694 --> 01:33:38,054
[SPEAKER_10]: The part.

1480
01:33:38,134 --> 01:33:39,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds amazingly racist.

1481
01:33:39,115 --> 01:33:39,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1482
01:33:39,695 --> 01:33:40,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And this little girl named Momo.

1483
01:33:43,097 --> 01:33:44,638
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all like speaking random English.

1484
01:33:44,698 --> 01:33:45,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hilarious.

1485
01:33:45,398 --> 01:33:47,059
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not a documentary.

1486
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a drama-dy?

1487
01:33:49,721 --> 01:33:51,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dorama.

1488
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:52,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1489
01:33:53,956 --> 01:34:00,538
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like this guy completely knows nothing of Japanese life and he's teaching the girls these lessons through his innocence.

1490
01:34:00,698 --> 01:34:02,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And they teach him the magic of dance.

1491
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:09,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the fourth episode now out of 11 and it's pretty funny.

1492
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:11,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I missed this.

1493
01:34:12,482 --> 01:34:13,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I'll watch more Hoarders.

1494
01:34:14,103 --> 01:34:14,383
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1495
01:34:15,943 --> 01:34:18,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, teach me the magic of dance.

1496
01:34:18,244 --> 01:34:18,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1497
01:34:18,924 --> 01:34:20,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, not time for Twitter topics yet.

1498
01:34:20,244 --> 01:34:20,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Be quiet.

1499
01:34:20,805 --> 01:34:21,065
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1500
01:34:21,585 --> 01:34:21,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

1501
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:34,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at the club the other night and I actually heard a song and the lyrics were and the song is called Commander and the lyrics were tonight I'll be your commander and I command you to dance

1502
01:34:37,217 --> 01:34:38,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where that came from.

1503
01:34:38,477 --> 01:34:39,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was my Facebook update the other night.

1504
01:34:40,018 --> 01:34:41,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit homosexual.

1505
01:34:41,478 --> 01:34:42,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little.

1506
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it Commander or Commander?

1507
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:45,720
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Commander.

1508
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a Commodore 64.

1509
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it Commander better.

1510
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:54,422
[SPEAKER_10]: No, when I tell you who it was singing it, that's how you'll know how homosexual it was.

1511
01:34:54,962 --> 01:34:55,323
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

1512
01:34:55,663 --> 01:34:55,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1513
01:34:56,103 --> 01:34:56,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Kelly Rowland.

1514
01:34:57,691 --> 01:34:58,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1515
01:34:58,672 --> 01:35:00,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the not Beyonce.

1516
01:35:00,774 --> 01:35:01,374
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

1517
01:35:01,835 --> 01:35:02,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyonce.

1518
01:35:02,195 --> 01:35:03,616
[SPEAKER_10]: The other chick from Destiny's Child.

1519
01:35:03,757 --> 01:35:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1520
01:35:04,277 --> 01:35:04,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1521
01:35:04,777 --> 01:35:06,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it's not Beyonce.

1522
01:35:06,139 --> 01:35:07,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, video game news.

1523
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:07,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

1524
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew we did that on this show?

1525
01:35:09,582 --> 01:35:11,644
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of quick video game news tonight.

1526
01:35:11,684 --> 01:35:12,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy hell.

1527
01:35:12,264 --> 01:35:13,525
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of quick news tonight.

1528
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:18,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe Loki has a story starting off about Phantasy Star.

1529
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:23,614
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to say this first because this somehow did not even make our show roll, which is a travesty.

1530
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:28,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Phantasy Star Online 2 teased in a trailer this week at Tokyo Game Show.

1531
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,038
[SPEAKER_10]: What in the world?

1532
01:35:30,178 --> 01:35:30,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

1533
01:35:31,619 --> 01:35:38,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's the 10th anniversary of Phantasy Star Online and they have announced that next year they're going to put out Phantasy Star Online 2 for PC.

1534
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:39,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play it.

1535
01:35:40,024 --> 01:35:41,105
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not on console.

1536
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,946
[SPEAKER_10]: That's weird to me that it's not on console.

1537
01:35:42,986 --> 01:35:44,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what they're going to do with it.

1538
01:35:44,066 --> 01:35:46,488
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still getting to MMOs on consoles.

1539
01:35:46,528 --> 01:35:53,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, at least like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 because so far this generation there's been Final Fantasy XI.

1540
01:35:54,896 --> 01:35:55,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't there another one on 360?

1541
01:35:55,597 --> 01:35:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Fancy Star Universe.

1542
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,661
[SPEAKER_09]: But that had more of a single-player component to it, though.

1543
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:04,262
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't just an MMO.

1544
01:36:04,362 --> 01:36:08,304
[SPEAKER_10]: If those servers shut down, the game would still be playable.

1545
01:36:08,605 --> 01:36:10,005
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a really bad anime.

1546
01:36:10,566 --> 01:36:13,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I didn't mean to derail your story, Loki, but I had to throw that out there.

1547
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:18,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the break, we were talking about advertisement in games and how it's kind of terrible sometimes.

1548
01:36:19,171 --> 01:36:20,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is how you do it, dammit.

1549
01:36:20,872 --> 01:36:21,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, uh...

1550
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:28,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't think of a better way to possibly advertise in a game than how it's done in Phantasy Star Portable 2.

1551
01:36:29,235 --> 01:36:33,917
[SPEAKER_09]: What, may you ask, is actually the case with this?

1552
01:36:34,717 --> 01:36:38,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play Colonel Sanders in Phantasy Star Portable 2.

1553
01:36:39,519 --> 01:36:40,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That is awesome.

1554
01:36:40,379 --> 01:36:41,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

1555
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:42,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a playable character?

1556
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a playable character.

1557
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:46,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the Colonel is there to kick ass.

1558
01:36:47,681 --> 01:37:08,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Back from the dead, with his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices I read some story that like, most kids under 18 don't even know who Colonel Sanders is Oh, but he's gonna come and bitch slap him in the face now Now you'll remember me forever

1559
01:37:09,304 --> 01:37:17,629
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but seriously, they put them in the game, and this isn't a big surprise because actually, I believe it's in the upgraded version of Phantasy Star Portable 2.

1560
01:37:17,849 --> 01:37:19,049
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Infinity, I guess.

1561
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:26,513
[SPEAKER_09]: And the original Phantasy Star Portable 2 actually had Pizza Hut stuff in there with like a Pizza Hut box shield.

1562
01:37:26,794 --> 01:37:28,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell, you know what that means?

1563
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:31,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming in the next Phantasy Star game is Taco Bell.

1564
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:33,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1565
01:37:33,317 --> 01:37:34,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Make or run for the PSP.

1566
01:37:35,248 --> 01:37:37,248
[SPEAKER_18]: or the Noid comes back as a playable character.

1567
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the Noid would be awesome.

1568
01:37:38,969 --> 01:37:43,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but if anyone's seen the anime Project Echo, you don't mess with the Colonel.

1569
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:45,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Colonel.

1570
01:37:48,211 --> 01:37:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's so ridiculous.

1571
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:51,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Lee Awesome.

1572
01:37:52,652 --> 01:37:53,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It is awesome.

1573
01:37:53,292 --> 01:38:01,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of casting the typical ice firebolt spells, you'll be casting mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.

1574
01:38:02,298 --> 01:38:08,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart Attack, Grease Fire, KFC Bowl, Double Down, the bowl that looks like poop.

1575
01:38:11,501 --> 01:38:11,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1576
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:13,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

1577
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:15,302
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nasty and appropriate.

1578
01:38:15,342 --> 01:38:16,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it can't be unseen.

1579
01:38:16,622 --> 01:38:19,843
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they have pictures of him attacking stuff, so I'm trying to see what he...

1580
01:38:20,743 --> 01:38:27,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost looks like, and I kid you not, and I don't understand this, but it almost looks like he has a magic wand.

1581
01:38:27,128 --> 01:38:31,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he's fucking Harry Potter of the, you know, fast food world or something.

1582
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:34,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's like hitting something.

1583
01:38:34,953 --> 01:38:37,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, seriously looking like he's bitch slapping someone right there.

1584
01:38:38,155 --> 01:38:39,476
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all on Famitsu, of course.

1585
01:38:39,836 --> 01:38:43,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one more here because it looks like he's throwing a fireball or something.

1586
01:38:44,439 --> 01:38:45,640
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I love the Japanese.

1587
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's got like, seriously, he's got like a magical wand.

1588
01:38:48,942 --> 01:38:49,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

1589
01:38:50,526 --> 01:38:58,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Colonel Sanders, did you put your name in the goblet of fire?

1590
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:10,261
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, gravy heel, please VidPower says, when are they going to make a fighter featuring the Arby's oven mitt?

1591
01:39:11,182 --> 01:39:14,645
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRDollarBill says, your wand, Sanders, is it made from chicken feather?

1592
01:39:17,012 --> 01:39:43,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I seriously think you know how Burger King does their stupid Burger King games Sneak King was fucking rad which by the way when they do release their Kinect games I'm buying all of them I don't care how terrible they are because they're awesome seriously KFC needs to come up with an original game where it's like oh kids don't know who Colonel Sanders is he's back to kick some fucking ass with his magical wand he's a fucking ninja that's what he is

1593
01:39:44,091 --> 01:39:45,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, I'm back from the dead!

1594
01:39:45,852 --> 01:39:46,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh!

1595
01:39:46,332 --> 01:39:48,353
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gonna battle Voldemort as well.

1596
01:39:48,633 --> 01:39:50,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it bad that your little thing is blinking red?

1597
01:39:51,095 --> 01:39:52,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean it's gonna explode?

1598
01:39:52,355 --> 01:39:53,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, it just means the battery's low.

1599
01:39:53,936 --> 01:39:54,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1600
01:39:55,117 --> 01:39:56,778
[SPEAKER_09]: This means I won't have internet after a while.

1601
01:39:56,798 --> 01:39:57,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a little worried.

1602
01:39:57,438 --> 01:39:58,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1603
01:39:58,519 --> 01:39:59,899
[SPEAKER_09]: It means the time bomb's going off.

1604
01:39:59,919 --> 01:40:01,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

1605
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,982
[SPEAKER_10]: This show will self-destruct in 30 seconds.

1606
01:40:04,062 --> 01:40:05,342
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought Burger King into my house.

1607
01:40:08,223 --> 01:40:08,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's alright.

1608
01:40:08,743 --> 01:40:12,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I should finish my downloads when I get home because this is so slow.

1609
01:40:12,185 --> 01:40:13,006
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you downloading?

1610
01:40:13,426 --> 01:40:13,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Apps.

1611
01:40:14,306 --> 01:40:16,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm downloading the two Monkey Island apps.

1612
01:40:17,108 --> 01:40:17,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Sweet.

1613
01:40:18,189 --> 01:40:20,390
[SPEAKER_18]: But I thought that's not like a 4G router?

1614
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:21,771
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just 3G.

1615
01:40:24,452 --> 01:40:26,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I don't know anything about it.

1616
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:26,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Next story!

1617
01:40:27,995 --> 01:40:31,298
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm sorry, it's just so awesome that we have to keep talking about the girl.

1618
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:38,784
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Halo Reach, of course, you know, one of the big things with Halo, and it's kind of become infamous because of it.

1619
01:40:39,565 --> 01:40:47,271
[SPEAKER_09]: The horrible people on Xbox Live, and it's a lot of little kids that really shouldn't be playing... I love when you start off, the horrible people on Xbox Live.

1620
01:40:48,932 --> 01:40:49,393
[SPEAKER_09]: It really...

1621
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:54,457
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just a bunch of little kids that should have no business playing this game.

1622
01:40:54,937 --> 01:40:56,398
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on there playing this game.

1623
01:40:57,058 --> 01:41:08,862
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you run across some douchebags that are playing the game and being jerks online and you mute them, if enough people mute them, they will just be auto-muted by everybody.

1624
01:41:09,322 --> 01:41:13,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So you won't have to listen to them over a period of time.

1625
01:41:14,103 --> 01:41:16,904
[SPEAKER_18]: But they just like to call people fun, amazing guys.

1626
01:41:18,525 --> 01:41:18,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1627
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:23,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1628
01:41:23,872 --> 01:41:25,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I praise your heterosexuality.

1629
01:41:26,954 --> 01:41:27,755
[SPEAKER_03]: We are friends.

1630
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,658
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's available, of course, now.

1631
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:38,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, apparently, who would have thought, the PSP 2 is in the works.

1632
01:41:39,643 --> 01:41:45,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And, in fact, the Mortal Kombat developers have a development unit of it right now.

1633
01:41:45,928 --> 01:41:51,912
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it's a pretty powerful machine and that they will be working on games for it.

1634
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:57,616
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't even have a 3DS yet, but apparently they have a PSP2.

1635
01:41:57,756 --> 01:42:01,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps the PSP2 will be launching next year soon?

1636
01:42:02,459 --> 01:42:02,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe?

1637
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,203
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess we'll have to wait and see what they do to enhance stuff on that.

1638
01:42:08,363 --> 01:42:10,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, newsflash of PSP2s in development.

1639
01:42:10,705 --> 01:42:11,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Shocking, huh?

1640
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:29,085
[SPEAKER_09]: File that next to duh and of course But the news is that they have a unit and that it would probably be close to be releasing Next year's E3 I'm sure it will be next holiday Alongside Shattered Memories 2 The next winner of the E3 game

1641
01:42:30,006 --> 01:42:33,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio, three games analysts.

1642
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:34,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes.

1643
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:35,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Analysts, sorry, analysts.

1644
01:42:36,051 --> 01:42:45,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And Red Faction Armageddon is coming May 2011 next year, and of course that'll be the next big game from the Saints Row developers.

1645
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:51,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And speaking of Saints Row, they will be putting out a new Saints Row game next fall.

1646
01:42:52,685 --> 01:42:54,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So sad, it's so far away.

1647
01:42:55,967 --> 01:42:56,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that game.

1648
01:42:57,348 --> 01:42:57,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you do.

1649
01:42:58,269 --> 01:43:00,170
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so terribly awesome.

1650
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:01,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

1651
01:43:01,351 --> 01:43:08,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something maybe you could play in the meantime would be PopCap World because PopCap and NCSoft have teamed up to bring you PopCap World.

1652
01:43:09,456 --> 01:43:23,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh boy, because you have NCSoft who makes those highly addictive Korean MMOs and then some of the ones over here too such as ION and Guild Wars and then PopCap, makers of virtual crack like Peggle, Plants and Zombies and Bejeweled.

1653
01:43:24,406 --> 01:43:28,210
[SPEAKER_10]: PopCap and NCSoft have come together to bring PopCap World.

1654
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:30,211
[SPEAKER_10]: This platform will be launching later this year.

1655
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:31,833
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be operated by NCSoft.

1656
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:34,375
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to feature 13 PopCap titles at launch.

1657
01:43:34,735 --> 01:43:38,819
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be free with optional premium paid elements to be added later.

1658
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:44,564
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies and an all-new multiplayer game called Super Zuma.

1659
01:43:45,345 --> 01:43:47,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the other thing you should know about this.

1660
01:43:47,746 --> 01:43:48,846
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only for Korea.

1661
01:43:49,946 --> 01:43:51,166
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not coming out here.

1662
01:43:51,586 --> 01:43:53,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck did you tell us, Rob?

1663
01:43:53,587 --> 01:43:55,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just want you to know what you're missing out on.

1664
01:43:55,987 --> 01:44:00,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Zuma, by the way, was, quote, built exclusively for Korean players.

1665
01:44:00,588 --> 01:44:04,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So Super Zuma apparently uses StarCraft characters.

1666
01:44:06,049 --> 01:44:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And the screen is very narrow for their eyes.

1667
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:09,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

1668
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:10,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I can say it.

1669
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:11,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Asian.

1670
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:12,711
[SPEAKER_10]: You can say it.

1671
01:44:12,891 --> 01:44:13,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

1672
01:44:13,652 --> 01:44:14,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1673
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:17,153
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, that's going to be interesting.

1674
01:44:17,874 --> 01:44:22,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised they won't release that here, but maybe Facebook games are doing well enough for them here.

1675
01:44:22,416 --> 01:44:24,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they ever release the Zuma game on Facebook?

1676
01:44:25,237 --> 01:44:25,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1677
01:44:25,578 --> 01:44:27,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did Zoom on Facebook.

1678
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they were going to.

1679
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:31,304
[SPEAKER_10]: They were going to do Zoom on Facebook and then of course there's Bejeweled.

1680
01:44:31,884 --> 01:44:34,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's all about just cross-promoting their iPhone apps.

1681
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:35,108
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they're making money.

1682
01:44:35,268 --> 01:44:37,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, do you have Plants vs. Zombies on your new iPod Touch?

1683
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:38,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

1684
01:44:38,431 --> 01:44:38,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very fun.

1685
01:44:39,112 --> 01:44:39,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome!

1686
01:44:40,593 --> 01:44:43,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I played a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies this week for the first time.

1687
01:44:43,436 --> 01:44:46,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you believe I've never played that game before and I finally played it this week on Xbox Live?

1688
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:47,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.

1689
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:48,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played it.

1690
01:44:48,322 --> 01:44:49,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crack rock.

1691
01:44:49,063 --> 01:44:51,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've played a zillion and one tower defense games before.

1692
01:44:51,707 --> 01:44:53,048
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, this is another one.

1693
01:44:53,068 --> 01:44:53,789
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's cute.

1694
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:55,071
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pop crack.

1695
01:44:55,492 --> 01:44:55,852
[SPEAKER_21]: Mm-hmm.

1696
01:44:55,952 --> 01:44:56,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Mm-hmm.

1697
01:44:57,014 --> 01:44:57,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

1698
01:44:57,514 --> 01:45:00,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of other crack games, some people really love these games.

1699
01:45:01,037 --> 01:45:03,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Muramasa, The Demon Blade, and Odin Sphere.

1700
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:08,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, these games are being remade in HD, if rumors are to be believed.

1701
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:09,684
[SPEAKER_10]: This is only rumor right now.

1702
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:15,029
[SPEAKER_10]: The re-releases are highly likely for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

1703
01:45:15,369 --> 01:45:16,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the giveaway.

1704
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:19,993
[SPEAKER_10]: They're being listed by the Australia Ratings Board as multi-platform.

1705
01:45:20,433 --> 01:45:20,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1706
01:45:21,594 --> 01:45:24,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Odin Sphere, of course, was originally on the PS2, Muramasa on the Wii.

1707
01:45:25,076 --> 01:45:27,657
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of awesome if those games were re-released.

1708
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:32,821
[SPEAKER_10]: The Last Guardian finally has a release date.

1709
01:45:32,941 --> 01:45:33,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Holiday 2011.

1710
01:45:34,602 --> 01:45:36,963
[SPEAKER_10]: You might remember this was the game they showed, I think, in a trailer.

1711
01:45:37,463 --> 01:45:39,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't they show this for the first time, like, last year's E3?

1712
01:45:40,839 --> 01:45:43,101
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but they finally showed it at Tokyo Game Show.

1713
01:45:43,301 --> 01:45:44,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Another trailer.

1714
01:45:45,002 --> 01:45:47,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is the Ico Shadow of the Colossus.

1715
01:45:47,824 --> 01:45:48,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

1716
01:45:48,624 --> 01:45:48,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Holiday 2011.

1717
01:45:49,425 --> 01:45:50,125
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks epic.

1718
01:45:50,185 --> 01:45:50,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I gotta say.

1719
01:45:50,826 --> 01:45:51,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play it.

1720
01:45:51,326 --> 01:45:54,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has a big, cute, sort of puppy thing.

1721
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play it.

1722
01:45:55,309 --> 01:45:57,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a whole little trailer here that was from Tokyo Game Show.

1723
01:45:57,570 --> 01:45:58,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play a little clip here.

1724
01:45:58,471 --> 01:46:00,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to play the whole thing.

1725
01:46:00,032 --> 01:46:01,853
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can see it's loud.

1726
01:46:01,993 --> 01:46:02,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

1727
01:46:02,854 --> 01:46:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched this the other day.

1728
01:46:03,914 --> 01:46:04,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.

1729
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:05,475
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that giant puppy thing.

1730
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:08,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know what the hell it is, but I'd play the game.

1731
01:46:08,758 --> 01:46:10,499
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's going to crap on that guy.

1732
01:46:11,259 --> 01:46:20,144
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, speaking of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, the collection that's been rumored for the past couple weeks, it's true.

1733
01:46:21,044 --> 01:46:24,386
[SPEAKER_10]: It's HD remakes coming exclusively to the PlayStation 3.

1734
01:46:25,607 --> 01:46:26,727
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also in 3D.

1735
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:59,052
[SPEAKER_10]: but whatever at least they're 2D as well yeah they're coming to the PlayStation 3 they won't name a release date they're just saying soon but of course the retailers were rumoring April 2011 Sony Computer Entertainment America actually confirmed later spring 2011 so it's coming there's box art and everything and there's a trailer for that as well the game looks sexy as hell and I'm going to admit I didn't really play these games the first time around I watched Loki play one of them

1736
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a certain unnamed person play them.

1737
01:47:01,573 --> 01:47:01,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1738
01:47:01,993 --> 01:47:02,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1739
01:47:02,313 --> 01:47:03,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they hot?

1740
01:47:03,753 --> 01:47:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all that Ico is, is this girl making a stupid noise following you.

1741
01:47:09,015 --> 01:47:12,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Shadow of the Colossus is like, you're climbing a guy and killing him.

1742
01:47:12,376 --> 01:47:12,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1743
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:14,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure it would be fun.

1744
01:47:14,197 --> 01:47:17,878
[SPEAKER_03]: You make these sound so stupid, but they're like some of the highest critically acclaimed games.

1745
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:18,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know.

1746
01:47:18,978 --> 01:47:21,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It was boring to me, but I think if I played it, I'd probably like it better.

1747
01:47:22,898 --> 01:47:25,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Comment from our chat room from Spazinator PSN.

1748
01:47:25,301 --> 01:47:28,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that puppy thing remind you of the Luck Dragon from The NeverEnding Story?

1749
01:47:28,927 --> 01:47:29,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Falkor?

1750
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:32,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah!

1751
01:47:32,231 --> 01:47:32,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinda.

1752
01:47:32,832 --> 01:47:34,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he always sound like he was high?

1753
01:47:34,615 --> 01:47:35,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Falkor?

1754
01:47:35,456 --> 01:47:37,038
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh yeah.

1755
01:47:37,178 --> 01:47:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Scratch my ear.

1756
01:47:41,059 --> 01:47:43,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, get me some munchies, could ya?

1757
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been laying here for like six hours, really high.

1758
01:47:46,861 --> 01:47:48,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, derailing.

1759
01:47:48,401 --> 01:47:50,602
[SPEAKER_10]: So where, no, it's okay, it happens on this show as well.

1760
01:47:50,942 --> 01:47:53,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So where is Frank West in Dead Rising 2?

1761
01:47:53,582 --> 01:47:57,963
[SPEAKER_10]: He isn't showing up in the game, and you know, Frank West, of course, was the main character in Dead Rising 1.

1762
01:47:58,003 --> 01:47:58,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

1763
01:47:58,644 --> 01:47:59,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he's been found.

1764
01:47:59,584 --> 01:48:00,424
[SPEAKER_09]: He's covered wars, you know.

1765
01:48:00,744 --> 01:48:00,944
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1766
01:48:01,684 --> 01:48:03,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I said he's covered wars, you know.

1767
01:48:03,245 --> 01:48:03,765
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1768
01:48:04,345 --> 01:48:08,687
[SPEAKER_10]: He's coming to a new game called Dead Rising Case West.

1769
01:48:09,068 --> 01:48:11,629
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, it's an epilogue to Dead Rising 2.

1770
01:48:12,349 --> 01:48:15,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Aha, so Dead Rising Case 0 was the prologue.

1771
01:48:16,091 --> 01:48:18,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Case West will now be the epilogue.

1772
01:48:19,033 --> 01:48:19,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it?

1773
01:48:20,113 --> 01:48:23,014
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you've seen photos of the two characters standing next to each other.

1774
01:48:23,075 --> 01:48:24,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Case West is going to be a download title.

1775
01:48:25,136 --> 01:48:27,497
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be exclusive on the Xbox 360.

1776
01:48:27,997 --> 01:48:31,899
[SPEAKER_10]: It will have co-op play where one of you is Chuck and one of you is Frank.

1777
01:48:33,729 --> 01:48:39,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to my gay friends, but no word about hot man-on-man action with the Chuck and Frank.

1778
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Boo!

1779
01:48:40,893 --> 01:48:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Next topic.

1780
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:43,675
[SPEAKER_03]: No gayness in this one.

1781
01:48:45,295 --> 01:48:49,078
[SPEAKER_18]: On that topic, DarkSakura, you've heard of the Doctor Who game, right?

1782
01:48:49,718 --> 01:48:49,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1783
01:48:50,118 --> 01:48:55,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And considering now that Russell T. Davies is the head of Doctor Who, do you think there'll be any man-on-man action in the game?

1784
01:48:56,641 --> 01:48:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Captain Jack in it.

1785
01:48:57,762 --> 01:49:01,285
[SPEAKER_18]: We need Captain Jack and the 50 million gay kisses he has on Torchwood.

1786
01:49:01,886 --> 01:49:02,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1787
01:49:02,486 --> 01:49:03,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.

1788
01:49:03,607 --> 01:49:06,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you've heard about the new season of Torchwood.

1789
01:49:06,369 --> 01:49:07,690
[SPEAKER_10]: The gay alarm is going off.

1790
01:49:08,331 --> 01:49:09,652
[SPEAKER_10]: This show got too gay.

1791
01:49:09,672 --> 01:49:10,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

1792
01:49:11,073 --> 01:49:11,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, John Barrowman.

1793
01:49:11,794 --> 01:49:12,455
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in Rob Network.

1794
01:49:13,555 --> 01:49:14,796
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1795
01:49:15,276 --> 01:49:20,517
[SPEAKER_10]: We just got an order from the police department of Sacramento to turn down the gayness a little bit, please.

1796
01:49:21,318 --> 01:49:23,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Too late.

1797
01:49:24,459 --> 01:49:25,819
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some other news, Rob?

1798
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:34,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has characters that make me absolutely, absolutely, really, really happy.

1799
01:49:35,262 --> 01:49:35,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Horny?

1800
01:49:37,521 --> 01:49:37,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1801
01:49:38,061 --> 01:49:39,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that's what she was going to say.

1802
01:49:39,081 --> 01:49:40,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't going to go there, but all right.

1803
01:49:41,042 --> 01:49:41,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I said happy.

1804
01:49:43,623 --> 01:49:44,943
[SPEAKER_05]: X23 is in the game.

1805
01:49:44,983 --> 01:49:46,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me happy.

1806
01:49:46,904 --> 01:49:52,505
[SPEAKER_05]: As in the chick clone of Wolverine, who's actually kind of awesome.

1807
01:49:53,065 --> 01:49:53,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot?

1808
01:49:53,725 --> 01:49:54,606
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, hot?

1809
01:49:55,626 --> 01:49:59,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if you like... So then you would be a little horny.

1810
01:49:59,447 --> 01:50:00,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

1811
01:50:00,367 --> 01:50:01,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I would bite my butt, Rob.

1812
01:50:02,968 --> 01:50:06,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, you know, we also have Tron Bon in there.

1813
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:25,093
[SPEAKER_05]: and also other characters announced for Street Fighter 4 this is pretty cool is Yun and Yang so pretty cool from Street Fighter 3 I think that's pretty cool they were fun to play and Chun-Li

1814
01:50:26,205 --> 01:50:26,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not like Chun-Li.

1815
01:50:27,526 --> 01:50:30,769
[SPEAKER_10]: She's in every fucking Street Fighter game except the very first one.

1816
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:32,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Fighting Street.

1817
01:50:34,272 --> 01:50:45,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And then IGN found a game-breaking bug in a certain game that we like to complain about sometimes, even though I don't think any of us in here have played it.

1818
01:50:46,242 --> 01:50:48,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Metroid Other M. I just know it's crap.

1819
01:50:48,864 --> 01:50:49,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1820
01:50:50,565 --> 01:50:51,086
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D Metroid.

1821
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:52,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not passing judgment until I play it.

1822
01:50:54,088 --> 01:50:57,831
[SPEAKER_18]: And Rice Princess doesn't like any of the 3D Metroid games, so she's biased.

1823
01:50:58,151 --> 01:51:01,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't like horseless carriages and metal birds.

1824
01:51:03,215 --> 01:51:03,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you?

1825
01:51:04,436 --> 01:51:12,442
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, the bug, if you are in Sector 3 and a certain door stays locked, you'll be locked there forever.

1826
01:51:12,622 --> 01:51:13,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just stuck.

1827
01:51:14,424 --> 01:51:15,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like there being no boss at level 30.

1828
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: and Nintendo did confirm it and they said that right now the only solutions are to load an earlier save or start over from the beginning.

1829
01:51:27,204 --> 01:51:28,404
[SPEAKER_10]: What a solution!

1830
01:51:29,084 --> 01:51:31,886
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't said anything about fixing it.

1831
01:51:32,346 --> 01:51:34,787
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, duh, stupid, just restart the game.

1832
01:51:35,447 --> 01:51:40,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And the best part is they can't fix it because the Wii doesn't patch games.

1833
01:51:41,469 --> 01:51:45,431
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a potential that they can patch it through a firmware update.

1834
01:51:46,611 --> 01:51:47,052
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't.

1835
01:51:47,592 --> 01:51:47,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Poop.

1836
01:51:49,382 --> 01:51:50,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and good news.

1837
01:51:50,423 --> 01:51:51,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Good happy news.

1838
01:51:52,063 --> 01:51:52,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

1839
01:51:52,604 --> 01:51:54,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you're going to do.

1840
01:51:54,384 --> 01:51:54,584
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1841
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:54,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1842
01:51:54,905 --> 01:51:55,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanfare.

1843
01:51:55,865 --> 01:51:57,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a fanfare.

1844
01:51:57,626 --> 01:51:57,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1845
01:51:58,026 --> 01:52:00,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then sing it.

1846
01:52:01,767 --> 01:52:02,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Irene.

1847
01:52:02,628 --> 01:52:02,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1848
01:52:02,908 --> 01:52:03,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1849
01:52:03,488 --> 01:52:03,808
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

1850
01:52:03,828 --> 01:52:04,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting your fanfare music.

1851
01:52:05,309 --> 01:52:06,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But we already did it, Rob.

1852
01:52:06,509 --> 01:52:06,909
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done.

1853
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:08,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to do it anymore.

1854
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:10,291
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the stamp of Irene on it.

1855
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:10,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1856
01:52:11,531 --> 01:52:11,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1857
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:12,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's your fanfare.

1858
01:52:14,832 --> 01:52:15,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it.

1859
01:52:20,598 --> 01:52:23,239
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best shooting games ever.

1860
01:52:23,859 --> 01:52:25,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Treshar goodness.

1861
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say it's Treshar because it's treasure.

1862
01:52:28,801 --> 01:52:29,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun.

1863
01:52:30,141 --> 01:52:32,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1864
01:52:33,142 --> 01:52:35,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

1865
01:52:35,843 --> 01:52:36,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1866
01:52:37,764 --> 01:52:41,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be out in 2011 exclusively on Xbox Live Arcade.

1867
01:52:42,106 --> 01:52:45,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It will have updated graphics, online co-op, and an Ikaruga mode.

1868
01:52:47,105 --> 01:52:47,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Icaruga?

1869
01:52:48,206 --> 01:52:48,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

1870
01:52:48,626 --> 01:52:49,226
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always good.

1871
01:53:04,296 --> 01:53:04,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1872
01:53:04,656 --> 01:53:06,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a long time ago.

1873
01:53:06,398 --> 01:53:10,561
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I played Ikaruga was one of the boss fights in Tournament of the Champions.

1874
01:53:10,601 --> 01:53:11,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Ikaruga.

1875
01:53:12,042 --> 01:53:12,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun.

1876
01:53:13,182 --> 01:53:14,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time I played Radiant Silvergun.

1877
01:53:14,804 --> 01:53:15,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1878
01:53:16,104 --> 01:53:19,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I touched a Saturn copy at California Extreme.

1879
01:53:19,387 --> 01:53:19,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty.

1880
01:53:20,327 --> 01:53:21,088
[SPEAKER_05]: It was expensive.

1881
01:53:21,168 --> 01:53:22,449
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted like 600 bucks for it.

1882
01:53:22,489 --> 01:53:24,690
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's California Extreme!

1883
01:53:25,331 --> 01:53:26,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Extreme!

1884
01:53:26,652 --> 01:53:26,852
Thank you.

1885
01:53:26,872 --> 01:53:27,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Eddie.

1886
01:53:27,292 --> 01:53:28,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Extremely nerdy.

1887
01:53:28,874 --> 01:53:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

1888
01:53:30,275 --> 01:53:31,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Radiant Silvergun!

1889
01:53:32,057 --> 01:53:33,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, we're getting this!

1890
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:35,840
[SPEAKER_10]: He's so excited.

1891
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:37,362
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Twitter topics?

1892
01:53:37,682 --> 01:53:37,922
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1893
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:38,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1894
01:53:40,055 --> 01:53:58,006
[SPEAKER_10]: every week we read your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and I forgot to ask for them tonight so we have very few from tweeters who remember that we do this every week Rob fail that's alright we'll do a few well if you want if you wanted to get in a tweet and you forgot you could hurry up and send an email because I don't think DarkSakura has opened the mail bag yet so you can hurry yes don't

1895
01:53:59,006 --> 01:54:00,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

1896
01:54:00,426 --> 01:54:02,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1897
01:54:02,887 --> 01:54:04,387
[SPEAKER_10]: PodCulture sent a tweet.

1898
01:54:04,447 --> 01:54:07,207
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually isn't really directly related to the show, but I thought it was interesting.

1899
01:54:07,527 --> 01:54:09,668
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, Sorry gang, not going to make the live feed tonight.

1900
01:54:09,728 --> 01:54:12,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Playing a bit of Phantasy Star Portable 2, then calling it a night.

1901
01:54:12,508 --> 01:54:15,709
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, code required for online multiplayer and PSP 2.

1902
01:54:15,769 --> 01:54:18,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it looks like Sega has jumped on board with that whole thing.

1903
01:54:18,929 --> 01:54:19,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1904
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:27,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Swim sends us a tweet with a story about Microsoft believes that Kinect will blow away iPad sales.

1905
01:54:30,761 --> 01:54:31,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Good luck with that.

1906
01:54:31,302 --> 01:54:33,343
[SPEAKER_18]: In a totally unrelated product comparison.

1907
01:54:34,344 --> 01:54:35,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

1908
01:54:36,886 --> 01:54:38,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see how that's going to work.

1909
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:39,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas gifts, maybe?

1910
01:54:40,109 --> 01:54:40,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1911
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:45,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see that because the Kinect is only $150.

1912
01:54:45,513 --> 01:54:50,557
[SPEAKER_09]: The comments coming from Kudo Shunoda.

1913
01:54:50,577 --> 01:54:52,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And the iPad is way more expensive.

1914
01:54:52,615 --> 01:54:56,356
[SPEAKER_10]: The Xbox 360 is already selling better than the Wii and Sony right now.

1915
01:54:56,396 --> 01:54:58,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinect's really just going to boost that to a whole new level.

1916
01:55:16,363 --> 01:55:16,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 Launch

1917
01:55:36,821 --> 01:55:38,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's kind of a side-related question.

1918
01:55:38,362 --> 01:55:42,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you guys think that Xbox actually is not planning on another system in the next couple years?

1919
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:52,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to that in a minute, but first, A, they're going to sell more Kinects than Xbox 360s at launch, because there weren't any fucking Xbox 360s available at launch, remember?

1920
01:55:53,286 --> 01:55:57,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Never forget, there was like no 360s anywhere for like six months.

1921
01:55:58,188 --> 01:55:59,748
[SPEAKER_10]: They were in very limited supplies.

1922
01:56:00,249 --> 01:56:01,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I see what you're doing there, you little...

1923
01:56:03,895 --> 01:56:04,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Liar.

1924
01:56:04,355 --> 01:56:04,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1925
01:56:28,988 --> 01:56:32,909
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to name the Wii successor and I think that'll kind of be the first in a wave.

1926
01:56:33,309 --> 01:56:36,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably Microsoft in about two years will announce their successor too.

1927
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:43,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of updates to current consoles going on is because A, it's all about the digital distribution and upgrades.

1928
01:56:44,371 --> 01:56:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: B, it's because of the economy and people don't have $400, $500, $600 to jump on a brand new system.

1929
01:56:52,992 --> 01:56:54,072
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1930
01:57:13,857 --> 01:57:13,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1931
01:57:15,898 --> 01:57:16,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Clever!

1932
01:57:17,619 --> 01:57:19,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Well played, Microsoft.

1933
01:57:20,401 --> 01:57:21,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on to you, though.

1934
01:57:21,341 --> 01:57:29,466
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it also has its senses, and if the internal parts are getting too hot, which causes that, it actually shuts the system down before it will red-ring.

1935
01:57:30,046 --> 01:57:30,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wonderful.

1936
01:57:31,247 --> 01:57:32,448
[SPEAKER_18]: That is the worst solution ever.

1937
01:57:34,816 --> 01:57:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.

1938
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:38,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Or as Frisbee in chat calls it, the Xbox 360.

1939
01:57:38,577 --> 01:57:42,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, guffaw, guffaw, guffaw.

1940
01:57:43,778 --> 01:57:44,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good one.

1941
01:57:45,718 --> 01:57:46,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing though.

1942
01:57:46,839 --> 01:57:56,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be too excited for the next consoles because I'm going to tell you, especially probably from Sony's camp, the next series of consoles, one of them's going to get ballsy and it'll probably be Sony.

1943
01:57:57,261 --> 01:57:58,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally digital distribution.

1944
01:57:59,041 --> 01:57:59,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait.

1945
01:58:00,381 --> 01:58:01,382
[SPEAKER_10]: All digital distribution.

1946
01:58:01,922 --> 01:58:03,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the games better be cheaper.

1947
01:58:04,602 --> 01:58:04,942
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't.

1948
01:58:30,182 --> 01:58:31,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claws, send a link.

1949
01:58:31,842 --> 01:58:38,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of Apple and apps and stuff, they rejected the onions shoot people point blank in the face game.

1950
01:58:38,646 --> 01:58:39,487
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1951
01:58:39,607 --> 01:58:39,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1952
01:58:40,007 --> 01:58:41,348
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really too bad.

1953
01:58:41,368 --> 01:58:43,729
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a little trailer here that you can watch.

1954
01:58:45,450 --> 01:58:46,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I vanishing?

1955
01:58:46,891 --> 01:58:50,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is a whole little... We're about to have a photo of Loki playing.

1956
01:58:50,933 --> 01:58:51,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently...

1957
01:58:53,374 --> 01:58:55,796
[SPEAKER_10]: The Onion wrote about a fictional first-person shooter.

1958
01:58:55,836 --> 01:59:00,519
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Close Range, and you just repeatedly shoot people and animals point-blank in the face.

1959
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, that's a game?

1960
01:59:02,681 --> 01:59:05,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

1961
01:59:05,703 --> 01:59:07,584
[SPEAKER_18]: You mean that's not every first-person shooter?

1962
01:59:08,645 --> 01:59:17,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Video game fans are lining up today to be the first to purchase Close Range, the hotly anticipated video game in which players repeatedly shoot people point-blank in the face.

1963
01:59:18,192 --> 01:59:20,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.

1964
01:59:22,438 --> 01:59:22,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Bobby.

1965
01:59:23,058 --> 01:59:27,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Close Range is already being hailed by critics as the most important game of the year.

1966
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:33,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The first person shooter creates an immersive, richly detailed world where players shoot people in the face with guns.

1967
01:59:33,942 --> 01:59:36,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Reviewers say it brings a new level of depth to gaming.

1968
01:59:36,723 --> 01:59:43,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like great literature and film transports you to different worlds, Close Range transports you to a world where you fire bullets into an endless stream of faces.

1969
01:59:43,826 --> 01:59:49,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Fans say it's the game's well-developed characters and storyline that make close range so compelling.

1970
01:59:49,288 --> 01:59:54,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You just feel like you're inside this complex character who's thrust into a world where he has to blow people's heads off.

1971
01:59:54,310 --> 02:00:02,693
[SPEAKER_07]: The plot follows AJ, a man with a mysterious past who must explode hundreds of thousands of human faces on a quest to save his kidnapped brother.

1972
02:00:03,053 --> 02:00:04,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?

1973
02:00:04,554 --> 02:00:05,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who can help.

1974
02:00:06,895 --> 02:00:08,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where your brother is.

1975
02:00:08,475 --> 02:00:09,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me.

1976
02:00:09,376 --> 02:00:09,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Look out!

1977
02:00:10,563 --> 02:00:13,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But Closed Range's single-player story is just the beginning.

1978
02:00:14,005 --> 02:00:20,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Its outstanding multiplayer mode offers unparalleled interactivity by allowing players to blast each other's faces off.

1979
02:00:20,609 --> 02:00:21,889
[SPEAKER_07]: It's completely open-ended.

1980
02:00:21,929 --> 02:00:24,971
[SPEAKER_07]: You can shoot someone in the ear, but you can also shoot them in the eye.

1981
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:29,574
[SPEAKER_07]: With hundreds of hidden extras like side missions where players can take a break from shooting people in the face...

1982
02:00:30,314 --> 02:00:32,515
[SPEAKER_07]: That is horrible.

1983
02:00:33,816 --> 02:00:42,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the sequel, Close Range 2, Chainsaw Dawn, continuing the epic story next fall, Close Range fans have even more to look forward to.

1984
02:00:42,761 --> 02:00:44,762
[SPEAKER_07]: For the Onion News Network, I'm Jeff Tate.

1985
02:00:45,422 --> 02:00:48,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that was pretty amazing.

1986
02:00:48,344 --> 02:00:51,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that probably made for horrible radio, but they really did show...

1987
02:00:52,466 --> 02:00:55,708
[SPEAKER_10]: They really did show people shooting at close range.

1988
02:00:56,209 --> 02:00:58,510
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was a horse and an ostrich.

1989
02:00:58,730 --> 02:00:59,851
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see the difference.

1990
02:00:59,911 --> 02:01:02,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that every first person shooter game?

1991
02:01:03,354 --> 02:01:10,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, The Onion actually made it a game and submitted close range to sell on the App Store.

1992
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have bought it.

1993
02:01:13,621 --> 02:01:15,362
[SPEAKER_10]: You know Loki's looking it up right now.

1994
02:01:15,923 --> 02:01:17,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I already saw that news report.

1995
02:01:17,364 --> 02:01:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll check the jailbreak for us.

1996
02:01:19,385 --> 02:01:21,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Apple rejected it due to violence.

1997
02:01:22,367 --> 02:01:46,532
[SPEAKER_10]: However, The Onion has revised the game and resubmitted it But good luck The iPad and iPhone app stores prohibits apps portraying realistic images of people or animals being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured, or injured That didn't look really realistic That's awesome They must be on lots of crack to have that be their idea of realism

1998
02:01:47,847 --> 02:01:53,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, also from Tiger Claw, I know he wants us to know that the SingStar dance track list is out.

1999
02:01:53,855 --> 02:02:00,685
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, because now, thanks to the PlayStation Move, not only do you get to sing, but you get to dance in SingStar.

2000
02:02:01,146 --> 02:02:01,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

2001
02:02:01,546 --> 02:02:04,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Irene's really excited for my next SingStar party, aren't you?

2002
02:02:04,671 --> 02:02:04,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.

2003
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's some of the hits you can do in this new game for Sing Star Dance.

2004
02:02:10,475 --> 02:02:33,790
[SPEAKER_10]: NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye, Blondie, Heart of Glass, Cyndi Lauper, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For, KC and the Sunshine Band, That's the Way I Like It, LaRue with Bulletproof, Lady Gaga with Poker Face, New Kids on the Block with Hangin' Tough, Paula Abdul with Straight Up, Real to Real with I Like to Move It,

2005
02:02:35,351 --> 02:02:44,740
[SPEAKER_10]: The Backstreet Boys with Everybody Backstreet's Back and Irene's personal favorite The Black Eyed Peas with Shut Up Shut Up!

2006
02:02:44,921 --> 02:02:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, that's awesome

2007
02:02:49,301 --> 02:02:50,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pre-ordering that game, right?

2008
02:02:51,302 --> 02:02:51,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Never.

2009
02:02:52,903 --> 02:02:53,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2010
02:02:54,364 --> 02:02:55,625
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for the Twitter topic.

2011
02:02:55,645 --> 02:02:57,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those folks that didn't get their tweets read.

2012
02:02:57,827 --> 02:03:00,368
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll just have to tweet us a little faster next time, won't ya?

2013
02:03:00,789 --> 02:03:01,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to some gaming news.

2014
02:03:01,909 --> 02:03:07,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I hate to tear you away from Plants vs. Zombies, but I'm thinking you might want to read some stories for our listeners.

2015
02:03:07,773 --> 02:03:08,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, why not?

2016
02:03:09,094 --> 02:03:10,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we can just watch more Onion videos all night.

2017
02:03:10,835 --> 02:03:11,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Onion Lounge Radio, really.

2018
02:03:11,876 --> 02:03:13,037
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, whatever.

2019
02:03:14,297 --> 02:03:42,467
[SPEAKER_09]: EA apparently has not received significant backlash to their online pass remember the online pass is part of their project $10 which is the dumbest name for a project ever and it charges $10 for access to online games or online modes in games if you purchase the game used it says people know that bandwidth isn't free so the fact that we are diffusing online costs isn't seen as unreasonable

2020
02:03:43,667 --> 02:03:46,348
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes no sense, I'll just say.

2021
02:03:47,588 --> 02:03:49,569
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, people aren't complaining enough.

2022
02:03:50,129 --> 02:03:51,369
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a dumb excuse.

2023
02:03:51,389 --> 02:03:54,170
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all, oh, well, bandwidth's not free.

2024
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:56,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

2025
02:03:56,751 --> 02:03:57,651
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it just like that too.

2026
02:03:58,291 --> 02:03:59,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandwidth's not free.

2027
02:04:00,452 --> 02:04:01,212
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it more like this.

2028
02:04:01,552 --> 02:04:03,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandwidth is not free.

2029
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:05,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2030
02:04:21,488 --> 02:04:28,778
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you see, they were robbed of the $60 new game that that person might have potentially bought.

2031
02:04:28,798 --> 02:04:31,742
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter, it's still the same amount of people playing online.

2032
02:04:31,882 --> 02:04:38,851
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't have bought because it's $60, they buy used games because they're cheaper, and they probably would have just pirated it.

2033
02:04:39,383 --> 02:04:49,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have to go down to their fucking offices with a basket of apples and show them, okay, if I give you an apple, okay, how many apples do you have?

2034
02:04:49,651 --> 02:04:50,291
[SPEAKER_09]: You have one apple?

2035
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:55,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, say you sell that apple used back to GameStop, you have now zero apples.

2036
02:04:55,736 --> 02:04:57,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think GameStop buys apples.

2037
02:04:58,698 --> 02:04:59,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

2038
02:04:59,518 --> 02:05:00,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'd like to see you try.

2039
02:05:02,321 --> 02:05:05,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'd like to sell back this apple.

2040
02:05:05,043 --> 02:05:05,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2041
02:05:07,982 --> 02:05:10,523
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't buy apples.

2042
02:05:10,723 --> 02:05:14,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So EA, I purchased this apple from you for $60.

2043
02:05:15,666 --> 02:05:16,407
[SPEAKER_09]: You have my $60.

2044
02:05:18,328 --> 02:05:20,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I take this apple and give it to my friend Rob.

2045
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:26,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob has not paid you $60, but he'll be using this apple to play online.

2046
02:05:26,913 --> 02:05:31,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I will no longer be playing online with this apple because I don't have an apple anymore.

2047
02:05:31,676 --> 02:05:33,236
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people are playing online with this apple?

2048
02:05:33,256 --> 02:05:33,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

2049
02:05:33,796 --> 02:05:35,557
[SPEAKER_10]: But you said you brought a basket of apples.

2050
02:05:35,777 --> 02:05:38,337
[SPEAKER_10]: So you actually have like 20 more apples sitting in the basket.

2051
02:05:38,417 --> 02:05:38,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2052
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:41,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've paid for all those copies of the games.

2053
02:05:41,738 --> 02:05:43,698
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see these amazing online apples.

2054
02:05:43,818 --> 02:05:46,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to go online and download the apple for free.

2055
02:05:46,979 --> 02:05:48,199
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm going to do.

2056
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,040
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes down to it.

2057
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:51,240
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a dumb excuse.

2058
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:56,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be like saying... Let's see here.

2059
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:22,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, I went ahead and made this nice dinner out of food that I purchased from the grocery store However, for you to eat that dinner, you're going to have to pay that grocery store $10 Because they lost out the sales of you purchasing food from the grocery store Despite the fact that they still have the same amount of food in the grocery store Regardless, they've lost no money

2060
02:06:25,194 --> 02:06:25,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I will not.

2061
02:06:26,475 --> 02:06:27,415
[SPEAKER_09]: My voice must be heard.

2062
02:06:27,836 --> 02:06:29,617
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is they're not fighting.

2063
02:06:30,037 --> 02:06:34,099
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically just saying, oh, well, bandwidth costs money.

2064
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:36,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And gamers are like, oh, okay.

2065
02:06:36,281 --> 02:06:36,921
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense.

2066
02:06:37,862 --> 02:06:41,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of going, wait a second, I paid them for that bandwidth already.

2067
02:06:43,025 --> 02:06:50,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeontradio.com, SpazinatorPSN says, that's like a GM complaining that a car dealership sells used cars.

2068
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:56,033
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, wow, I haven't heard Loki say Apple this much since his latest Mac rant.

2069
02:06:57,314 --> 02:06:59,296
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, Apple Lounge Radio.

2070
02:07:00,677 --> 02:07:05,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, Seg says, but I'm sure they sell lemons.

2071
02:07:11,124 --> 02:07:17,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my answer to why they haven't seen that much backlash yet as far as the online passing goes.

2072
02:07:17,849 --> 02:07:21,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Because not a lot of people buy EA Sports games used.

2073
02:07:21,712 --> 02:07:26,855
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing that most people buy them brand new when they first come out because they have to have their EA Sports games.

2074
02:07:27,416 --> 02:07:32,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure that a lot of people that have bought EA Sports games are probably only buying one or two EA Sports games.

2075
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:37,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody's buying Tiger, NCAA Football, Madden, NHL.

2076
02:07:38,504 --> 02:07:39,444
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's buying everything.

2077
02:07:41,937 --> 02:07:45,600
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to guess that's probably why that no one's bitching about it.

2078
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:52,825
[SPEAKER_09]: But I bet you anything if this comes out a Medal of Honor or something like that and a bunch of people are buying it used later on, there will be people bitching.

2079
02:07:55,207 --> 02:08:03,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Xam in our chatroom says, Apple's online, the latest fruit-based MMORPG following Fruit Base Fantasy 11 and Papaya Star Online.

2080
02:08:04,314 --> 02:08:09,078
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, see, if you don't speak up, then they're just going to assume that everything is okay.

2081
02:08:09,218 --> 02:08:11,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, whatever.

2082
02:08:12,287 --> 02:08:13,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried, we tried.

2083
02:08:13,168 --> 02:08:17,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, their sales aren't going to hurt at all because, you know, Madden's going to be the top-selling game.

2084
02:08:17,832 --> 02:08:31,225
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, if, you know, EA, say, for example, puts out, I don't know, an MMO version of, like, Lilla's Pet Shop or something like that and charges $10 for online, I'm sure a lot of people won't buy it.

2085
02:08:31,285 --> 02:08:31,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, fuck that.

2086
02:08:31,966 --> 02:08:33,387
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's going to buy that game anyways.

2087
02:08:33,888 --> 02:08:34,868
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I talking about?

2088
02:08:34,888 --> 02:08:35,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Terrible example.

2089
02:08:35,489 --> 02:08:37,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Little girls everywhere want that game.

2090
02:08:38,684 --> 02:08:39,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello Kitty Online

2091
02:08:59,537 --> 02:09:01,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, going over to the Kinect in Microsoft.

2092
02:09:01,998 --> 02:09:05,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Some news about the whole camera scanning feature that's going on there.

2093
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:10,582
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember when they first showed Kinect in that whole little Milo demo?

2094
02:09:10,602 --> 02:09:18,025
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed like, ooh, I'm going to draw Milo a picture and put it up on the camera and he's going to show me... That's a wonderful penis you've drawn for me!

2095
02:09:19,085 --> 02:09:20,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much was the demo they were showing, right?

2096
02:09:21,229 --> 02:09:28,440
[SPEAKER_10]: But then when they actually showed the games you could play, it was all flail 2000 and dance and wave my hands.

2097
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:32,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And there really was nothing about, oh, it reads paper or any of that stuff, right?

2098
02:09:33,528 --> 02:09:33,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

2099
02:09:35,069 --> 02:09:40,513
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, this is still about Milo, have you seen the new Milo demo video that they had out there?

2100
02:09:41,253 --> 02:09:47,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what conference it was being shown at, and this isn't a bad joke or anything.

2101
02:09:47,717 --> 02:09:54,321
[SPEAKER_09]: They were actually showing it, apparently he's moved to the US because his family is conflicting or something like that.

2102
02:09:54,721 --> 02:09:55,061
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2103
02:10:13,015 --> 02:10:14,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it's Pedobear the game.

2104
02:10:15,616 --> 02:10:19,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, back to the scanning stuff.

2105
02:10:19,198 --> 02:10:23,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe now's not a good time to talk about Connect Joyride, which is the game I was actually going to talk about.

2106
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:26,861
[SPEAKER_10]: They were showing off a demo of this at Tokyo Game Show.

2107
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:35,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Big Park, the developers behind Joyride, which is a Microsoft-owned studio, they actually have worked in some of the camera capture into this game.

2108
02:10:35,604 --> 02:10:36,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the weird thing.

2109
02:10:37,285 --> 02:10:41,787
[SPEAKER_10]: What it does, when you do your vehicle customization options, you can pick your car's color.

2110
02:10:42,147 --> 02:10:50,431
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't like the colors in the game, Kinect will look at an item that you put in front of the camera and put its color on the car.

2111
02:10:51,812 --> 02:10:52,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

2112
02:10:52,912 --> 02:10:57,455
[SPEAKER_10]: How long until a car that is colored the same color as someone's penis?

2113
02:10:57,515 --> 02:10:58,375
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to know.

2114
02:11:00,436 --> 02:11:01,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Won't take that long.

2115
02:11:01,096 --> 02:11:02,157
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.

2116
02:11:04,656 --> 02:11:07,257
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the wonders of modern technology.

2117
02:11:07,337 --> 02:11:08,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It matches colors.

2118
02:11:09,637 --> 02:11:10,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

2119
02:11:10,878 --> 02:11:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Cocky.

2120
02:11:15,099 --> 02:11:20,620
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, you could also, by the way, capture textures and that whole thing in LittleBigPlanet.

2121
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:26,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, by the way, like, you know, last year or two years ago would already read pictures in front of the PlayStation Eye.

2122
02:11:26,962 --> 02:11:28,263
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually isn't anything new.

2123
02:11:29,083 --> 02:11:29,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you know.

2124
02:11:30,339 --> 02:11:30,960
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

2125
02:11:45,416 --> 02:12:12,546
[SPEAKER_05]: To make Wii controllers as part of the Nike 78 project Where they asked 78 artists to be creative with their shoes And so what it does is actually it changes the way a lot of these games are played And I think that he's using Wii Sports Or one of these balance board games And using a chair So he's jumping up and down for doing the little dance thing

2126
02:12:13,966 --> 02:12:18,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, but it looks like he can actually do the running in place stuff.

2127
02:12:18,928 --> 02:12:20,828
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like he's having an epileptic seizure.

2128
02:12:20,868 --> 02:12:22,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I'm sorry.

2129
02:12:23,429 --> 02:12:28,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just waiting for that dog in that one video to come out and push the chair before he sits down.

2130
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:29,631
[SPEAKER_10]: He falls on his ass.

2131
02:12:29,651 --> 02:12:30,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys seen this video?

2132
02:12:30,471 --> 02:12:30,812
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

2133
02:12:31,052 --> 02:12:37,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it looks like, though, it totally adds a lot more of a different dimension to the game.

2134
02:12:38,034 --> 02:12:39,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, it could be more active.

2135
02:12:40,355 --> 02:12:40,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it's Wii Boxing.

2136
02:12:41,817 --> 02:12:43,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a maniac, maniac That's what it looks like

2137
02:12:59,395 --> 02:13:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you want to look more ridiculous doing stuff on the Wii, yeah.

2138
02:13:03,677 --> 02:13:10,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, when he wasn't using the chair, it did look like he was actually kind of dancing along with the people on the screen instead of just using the balance board, you know?

2139
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it would be fun.

2140
02:13:13,081 --> 02:13:16,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just weird that he had to keep sitting on that chair, but you know, whatever.

2141
02:13:16,762 --> 02:13:18,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like using the bar in DDR.

2142
02:13:18,703 --> 02:13:20,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna judge, not gonna judge.

2143
02:13:20,324 --> 02:13:23,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag and the FUs of the Week coming up after just a couple more stories.

2144
02:13:23,979 --> 02:13:24,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

2145
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:30,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, apparently there's a new game coming out called Shadows of the Damned.

2146
02:13:31,725 --> 02:13:32,805
[SPEAKER_09]: You said a bad word.

2147
02:13:33,946 --> 02:13:34,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

2148
02:13:36,788 --> 02:13:44,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently this is the long-awaited collaboration of Suda51, Akami, and EA.

2149
02:13:44,974 --> 02:13:50,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, this new game is going to be a psychological action thriller.

2150
02:13:51,038 --> 02:13:51,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

2151
02:13:52,219 --> 02:13:55,081
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some Shadows of the Damned going on in the next room, right?

2152
02:13:55,121 --> 02:14:00,564
[SPEAKER_09]: According to Suda, he and Mikami wanted to make this game for a long time.

2153
02:14:00,604 --> 02:14:03,026
[SPEAKER_09]: He searched for the right publisher to bring it to the audience.

2154
02:14:03,486 --> 02:14:07,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, they said that they can reveal the game they've been working on together with EA.

2155
02:14:07,348 --> 02:14:09,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It's expected to release in 2011.

2156
02:14:09,329 --> 02:14:13,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

2157
02:14:13,752 --> 02:14:17,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he was working on another game also, which is kind of cool.

2158
02:14:18,135 --> 02:14:21,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Akira Yamaoka is doing music for that one, so that's pretty sweet.

2159
02:14:22,901 --> 02:14:23,321
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2160
02:14:24,022 --> 02:14:29,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, Akira Yamaoka, you know, left Konami, so, and he's supposedly partnering with EA now, so this- Bravo!

2161
02:14:29,385 --> 02:14:30,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Akira Yamaoka.

2162
02:14:31,426 --> 02:14:33,887
[SPEAKER_10]: This is gonna be a heck of a game, but we don't know anything but a title, right?

2163
02:14:33,927 --> 02:14:34,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And a little logo.

2164
02:14:34,468 --> 02:14:35,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing right now, yeah.

2165
02:14:35,248 --> 02:14:36,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even a screenshot, nothing.

2166
02:14:36,689 --> 02:14:37,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

2167
02:14:37,489 --> 02:14:41,492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be all, like, stick figures and psychological action.

2168
02:14:41,552 --> 02:14:43,813
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll probably be a big thing at E3 next year, I'm imagining.

2169
02:14:44,233 --> 02:14:46,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like Shattered Memories was?

2170
02:14:46,995 --> 02:14:48,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a psychological thriller.

2171
02:14:49,077 --> 02:14:51,379
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was also a different developer.

2172
02:14:51,399 --> 02:14:53,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it was shit.

2173
02:14:54,601 --> 02:14:57,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard your strong feelings about this earlier.

2174
02:14:57,964 --> 02:15:06,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of things that Irene is a big fan of, it was officially announced this week through Mila Jovovich that another Resident Evil movie is definitely coming.

2175
02:15:07,352 --> 02:15:09,813
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean with that, like, open ending?

2176
02:15:09,933 --> 02:15:10,393
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

2177
02:15:11,174 --> 02:15:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely you jest.

2178
02:15:13,414 --> 02:15:20,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote Mila Jovovich in the New York Magazine, quote, this new Resident Evil is the first one to ever open at number one worldwide.

2179
02:15:20,737 --> 02:15:24,539
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the biggest movie in the franchise, so we're definitely going to make another one.

2180
02:15:25,299 --> 02:15:30,503
[SPEAKER_10]: She's also asking fans to send suggestions for the next film to her Twitter page.

2181
02:15:31,344 --> 02:15:43,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to tweet her and tell her some ideas, like make a movie that doesn't suck, you could tweet her at M-I-L-L-A J-O-V-O-V-I-C-H because you don't know how to spell it.

2182
02:15:44,753 --> 02:15:45,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2183
02:15:46,894 --> 02:15:48,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Suggestion, do not make another movie.

2184
02:15:50,515 --> 02:15:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2185
02:15:51,776 --> 02:15:54,636
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to get a Twitter account just to tweet that to her.

2186
02:15:54,697 --> 02:15:56,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the last ones, honestly.

2187
02:15:56,677 --> 02:15:58,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen the very last one, but I want to.

2188
02:15:58,878 --> 02:16:00,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't mind the first three movies.

2189
02:16:00,838 --> 02:16:05,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The third one was kind of... But this one was just pretty horrible.

2190
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,700
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

2191
02:16:32,367 --> 02:16:32,607
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

2192
02:16:57,881 --> 02:16:58,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will.

2193
02:16:59,689 --> 02:17:02,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this comes from Rini.

2194
02:17:04,264 --> 02:17:05,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings, OLR.

2195
02:17:05,145 --> 02:17:12,589
[SPEAKER_05]: On episode 381, you lamented over Guitar Hero Warrior of Rock's ability to post accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook.

2196
02:17:12,709 --> 02:17:19,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I should mention, Rock Band 3 also has media integration features, but they have a bit of use.

2197
02:17:19,433 --> 02:17:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you can make a setlist and post it for friends to see or try out.

2198
02:17:23,435 --> 02:17:25,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can throttle the frequency of posts.

2199
02:17:25,957 --> 02:17:31,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Another concern with Rock Band 3 is promo DLC, which is going to be separate from standard DLC.

2200
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:34,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to clarify, this pro DLC is only for guitar and bass.

2201
02:17:35,062 --> 02:17:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro keys and drums are included in the normal DLC.

2202
02:17:38,003 --> 02:17:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: There's... Sweet!

2203
02:17:39,504 --> 02:17:52,350
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more interesting details I could just gloss over, but rather than tire poor DarkSakura's windpipes, I'll just link you guys to a few sources to skim over interesting details if you want to bring up such as harmonics, making older DLC compatible with keys in pro mode.

2204
02:17:52,771 --> 02:17:53,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, different stuff.

2205
02:17:54,011 --> 02:17:55,052
[SPEAKER_05]: All stuff coming out of packs.

2206
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I am really excited.

2207
02:17:57,154 --> 02:18:01,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually did not pick up on the fact that Pro Keys was gonna be just included.

2208
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:02,981
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually makes me really happy.

2209
02:18:04,803 --> 02:18:05,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm smiling.

2210
02:18:06,946 --> 02:18:08,828
[SPEAKER_10]: You just can't see it because it's radio, but I'm smiling.

2211
02:18:09,821 --> 02:18:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email, hey Orange Lounge Radio, Haseo Sumirogawa here for the third time in this lovely marathon episode.

2212
02:18:15,043 --> 02:18:15,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was, yeah, last week.

2213
02:18:15,903 --> 02:18:16,563
[SPEAKER_10]: This must be an old one.

2214
02:18:17,463 --> 02:18:21,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, in an earlier episode I asked about a problem with downloading Bleach Heat The Soul 6.

2215
02:18:22,765 --> 02:18:25,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys said be more detailed, so here it is.

2216
02:18:25,526 --> 02:18:28,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Bleach Heat The Soul 6 is a PSP game.

2217
02:18:28,667 --> 02:18:30,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded it and it was a RAR file.

2218
02:18:32,288 --> 02:18:34,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you downloaded a fake.

2219
02:18:35,629 --> 02:18:41,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't help him with that unless he gets into something a little more legitimate.

2220
02:18:41,931 --> 02:18:50,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to pay the extra cost of importing at $60 which is a bit ridiculous considering the extra $20 for next day shipping so they can kiss my butt on that front.

2221
02:18:50,733 --> 02:18:53,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually... You can buy, by the way, import PSP games at Fry's.

2222
02:18:54,794 --> 02:18:54,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

2223
02:18:57,055 --> 02:18:59,536
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually, I'm going to take shit for this, but I don't care.

2224
02:18:59,576 --> 02:19:00,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said it on the show before.

2225
02:19:00,516 --> 02:19:03,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not opposed to pirating imported games, actually.

2226
02:19:03,737 --> 02:19:13,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think if they are not going to take a chance and release it over here, then why should we pay all this money in import fees to when they're not counting on us for their success anyway?

2227
02:19:13,279 --> 02:19:13,779
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

2228
02:19:14,219 --> 02:19:23,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I know that's going to be frowned upon by some people, but I really don't pirate games here in the US, but the import ones, yeah, I have.

2229
02:19:25,223 --> 02:19:26,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for reading my email.

2230
02:19:26,143 --> 02:19:27,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Loyal listeners, Sumira Gala.

2231
02:19:27,504 --> 02:19:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

2232
02:19:27,864 --> 02:19:31,506
[SPEAKER_05]: People are wondering, I got the name from Haseo from .hack//G.U.

2233
02:19:31,546 --> 02:19:31,907
[SPEAKER_05]: series.

2234
02:19:32,367 --> 02:19:34,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Sumira Gala from the Reader Die TV anime.

2235
02:19:34,288 --> 02:19:35,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know it's a woman's last name.

2236
02:19:35,789 --> 02:19:37,110
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really matter whose last name it is.

2237
02:19:37,490 --> 02:19:39,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But F you to all who have a problem with that.

2238
02:19:39,611 --> 02:19:40,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again.

2239
02:19:41,112 --> 02:19:44,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you can't help me via the radio, please do send a reply.

2240
02:19:46,415 --> 02:19:47,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Forward it to Loki.

2241
02:19:48,797 --> 02:19:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki can check the mailbox.

2242
02:19:54,497 --> 02:20:02,443
[SPEAKER_05]: The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report Monday on crime statistics for 2009 that showed a 5.3% drop in violent crimes nationwide and a 4.6% drop in property crimes.

2243
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:33,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest that they didn't define the drop context, whether it's per capita or total crimes, but all of these violent games poisoning our minds should turn us into gun-toting, cold-blooded killers.

2244
02:20:33,747 --> 02:20:40,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally believe that not just games, but media and software use in general may be indirectly causing the drop.

2245
02:20:40,551 --> 02:20:47,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching TV, playing games, browsing the intertubes, texting on our phones, and other sedentary activities are keeping us inside.

2246
02:20:48,076 --> 02:20:53,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just that, and here's where I get a little controversial, I believe that violence is inversely correlated with average weight.

2247
02:20:55,481 --> 02:20:56,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

2248
02:20:56,481 --> 02:20:59,343
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you are overweight, the less mayhem you'll be willing to do.

2249
02:20:59,743 --> 02:21:00,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Fat equals peace.

2250
02:21:00,904 --> 02:21:02,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's stretching it.

2251
02:21:02,485 --> 02:21:04,385
[SPEAKER_05]: That's discrimination right there.

2252
02:21:04,466 --> 02:21:05,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Or stretch pantsing it.

2253
02:21:09,168 --> 02:21:12,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone slowly step away from Rob.

2254
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:19,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to think if I've ever seen on the news somebody who committed a really horrible crime and if they were fat.

2255
02:21:19,974 --> 02:21:20,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm...

2256
02:21:21,781 --> 02:21:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there's been a few fatties busted.

2257
02:21:26,286 --> 02:21:29,028
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy who shot John Lennon was pretty fat, if I remember right.

2258
02:21:29,949 --> 02:21:31,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a really recent story, too.

2259
02:21:32,272 --> 02:21:34,934
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was commenting on the fact that you're like seven pounds, Rob.

2260
02:21:34,974 --> 02:21:36,255
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't saying you're fat, it was the opposite.

2261
02:21:36,396 --> 02:21:37,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Slim Jim over here.

2262
02:21:37,236 --> 02:21:38,117
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Robaba.

2263
02:21:38,578 --> 02:21:39,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, next email.

2264
02:21:42,261 --> 02:21:44,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is from somebody.

2265
02:21:46,041 --> 02:21:49,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, I've been listening to the show for a year now, my first episode being the fuck show.

2266
02:21:51,265 --> 02:21:53,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I have something weird to share with you.

2267
02:21:54,108 --> 02:21:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The very day after you guys had Omen in the cage match, DJ Hero posted a clip of it on YouTube.

2268
02:22:00,153 --> 02:22:00,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Coincidence?

2269
02:22:00,834 --> 02:22:02,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I think not, XD.

2270
02:22:02,815 --> 02:22:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: But one more thing.

2271
02:22:05,882 --> 02:22:10,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that song you use at the end of the show every weekend behind the But We're Probably Right Anyway message?

2272
02:22:11,066 --> 02:22:12,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find it anywhere, thanks.

2273
02:22:12,387 --> 02:22:14,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's just the Closing Time MIDI.

2274
02:22:14,128 --> 02:22:16,069
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an 8-bit remix of Closing Time.

2275
02:22:16,109 --> 02:22:21,973
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some website, I don't even know where it came from, because it was actually sent to me by a friend, and I was like, hey, we'll make that the closing theme of our show.

2276
02:22:22,614 --> 02:22:23,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is from Andy.

2277
02:22:23,934 --> 02:22:27,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe some website did a compilation of a bunch of 8-bit versions of songs.

2278
02:22:28,277 --> 02:22:29,818
[SPEAKER_10]: You could probably find it on YouTube.

2279
02:22:29,858 --> 02:22:33,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Google YouTube 8-bit Closing Time, you'll find it.

2280
02:22:33,801 --> 02:22:34,622
[SPEAKER_10]: High five, Actdeft, Viva Mexico

2281
02:23:01,417 --> 02:23:07,702
[SPEAKER_05]: My best geek moment was definitely when both of my kids, 6 and 8, actually requested I run a D&D campaign for them.

2282
02:23:08,282 --> 02:23:10,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're playing the Diceless Marvel RPG.

2283
02:23:11,225 --> 02:23:15,148
[SPEAKER_05]: As for anger management moments, my one real fight with my mom was when I was growing up.

2284
02:23:15,268 --> 02:23:20,492
[SPEAKER_05]: At 14, she came into my room and just turned off my SNES because she thought I had had enough video games for the day.

2285
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:28,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I thought differently and actually took her by the shoulders and proceeded to gently but firmly explain as I took her out of my room, locked the door, and turned my console back on again.

2286
02:23:28,938 --> 02:23:30,800
[SPEAKER_05]: She never bothered me with time limits after that.

2287
02:23:31,801 --> 02:23:32,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2288
02:23:32,501 --> 02:23:32,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

2289
02:23:33,722 --> 02:23:39,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, I've done the math, and considering my OLR cherry was popped somewhere in the to-go era... Is this guy skinny?

2290
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:42,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me finish.

2291
02:23:42,451 --> 02:23:42,671
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2292
02:23:43,071 --> 02:23:44,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Episode number now forgotten.

2293
02:23:44,332 --> 02:23:48,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not listed in the wiki, but it was the one where Rob came out of the closet for the audience.

2294
02:23:49,758 --> 02:23:52,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I've now listened to at least 200... Episode one?

2295
02:23:52,861 --> 02:23:53,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2296
02:23:54,282 --> 02:23:54,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I've...

2297
02:23:57,876 --> 02:24:01,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the gaydar Rob, just actually saying it.

2298
02:24:02,161 --> 02:24:15,938
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually might have been a while, because I think at the beginning of the show, I actually purposely didn't want to say anything, because not that I was ashamed of it, I'm certainly not, but it's just kind of one of those like, I was like, it's not your business, it doesn't matter, for a while, and then I had to change my heart.

2299
02:24:16,796 --> 02:24:18,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to finish this email, sorry.

2300
02:24:19,539 --> 02:24:27,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I've now listened to at least 245 episodes, or if you prefer, 621.5 hours, 2.5 hours a pop of OLR.

2301
02:24:28,208 --> 02:24:35,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's over 25 days of entertainment from you, so I'll just go ahead and thank you for one of the best months of my life and call it even for the next few episodes, okay?

2302
02:24:37,757 --> 02:24:39,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Gracias, muchas, muchas gracias.

2303
02:24:39,479 --> 02:24:41,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Dr. Noir, a.k.a.

2304
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:42,561
[SPEAKER_05]: the other Mexican recruit.

2305
02:24:43,122 --> 02:24:43,482
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

2306
02:24:43,802 --> 02:24:52,669
[SPEAKER_05]: This mail has been reviewed by two separate automated spelling and grammar censors and proofread by two young goats which were then sacrificed to the bard in order to keep the dark goddess appeased.

2307
02:24:54,161 --> 02:24:57,043
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, my name is spelled J-A-M-I-E, but thank you for trying.

2308
02:24:58,244 --> 02:24:58,824
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

2309
02:24:59,264 --> 02:25:00,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And people in other countries get a bye.

2310
02:25:01,406 --> 02:25:01,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2311
02:25:01,966 --> 02:25:02,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

2312
02:25:02,707 --> 02:25:03,768
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to tell you this.

2313
02:25:04,508 --> 02:25:08,471
[SPEAKER_05]: My first name was never misspelled until I moved to California.

2314
02:25:11,253 --> 02:25:11,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

2315
02:25:12,393 --> 02:25:14,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, people in Alabama can spell my name right.

2316
02:25:16,657 --> 02:25:17,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Next email.

2317
02:25:20,038 --> 02:25:21,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is another one from Rababa.

2318
02:25:22,139 --> 02:25:24,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I got what I believe can only be a phishing scam.

2319
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:30,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I get an email from Spoofed Blizzard inviting me to a beta of the next WoW expansion.

2320
02:25:30,802 --> 02:25:35,444
[SPEAKER_05]: The link is probably to a fake WoW login server because it didn't actually start with a Blizzard or WoW address.

2321
02:25:36,044 --> 02:25:38,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I don't even have a WoW account which made it extra fishy.

2322
02:25:39,065 --> 02:25:40,006
[SPEAKER_05]: PSA complete.

2323
02:25:40,746 --> 02:25:47,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I also got to play DarkSakura Sunday because I got nauseous playing Trackmania.

2324
02:25:47,367 --> 02:25:48,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Later, Robbaba.

2325
02:25:48,808 --> 02:25:50,168
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sounds legit to me.

2326
02:25:50,188 --> 02:25:51,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know what's funny?

2327
02:25:51,588 --> 02:25:53,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I get emails all the time for Ion Online.

2328
02:25:54,229 --> 02:25:57,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, log in and get free gold for Ion Online.

2329
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:58,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I don't even play, dude.

2330
02:25:58,770 --> 02:26:01,950
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I don't have an account, but okay, I'm gonna go do it right now.

2331
02:26:01,970 --> 02:26:03,771
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I have to tell you what Tiara said.

2332
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:07,212
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got import problems, Robbabil's bad for you, son.

2333
02:26:07,252 --> 02:26:09,172
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got 99 problems, but a pirate ain't one.

2334
02:26:10,976 --> 02:26:12,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, happy talk like a pirate day to you too.

2335
02:26:13,478 --> 02:26:20,063
[SPEAKER_10]: R. R. R. R. Derailed.

2336
02:26:20,883 --> 02:26:21,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiel Hall.

2337
02:26:22,864 --> 02:26:23,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

2338
02:26:24,926 --> 02:26:28,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

2339
02:26:30,710 --> 02:26:31,451
[SPEAKER_10]: The futures!

2340
02:26:32,311 --> 02:26:36,034
[SPEAKER_10]: But the present brings the angst and the FUs of the week.

2341
02:26:53,715 --> 02:26:54,195
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

2342
02:26:56,936 --> 02:27:00,178
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Algebra.

2343
02:27:01,919 --> 02:27:04,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2344
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:08,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say FU to actually I've got quite a few this week.

2345
02:27:09,542 --> 02:27:12,664
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to Ford for making really shitty cars.

2346
02:27:12,704 --> 02:27:21,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had to replace the thermostat housing on my car about three times now because it keeps breaking because it's made of plastic.

2347
02:27:22,208 --> 02:27:51,373
[SPEAKER_09]: and because it gets cracks in it because it oxidizes and that sucks and it's about $300 each time so F you to that F you people that while they're grocery shopping aren't paying attention to where the hell they are and they're totally blocking the aisle they have their card on one side and they're just browsing totally oblivious to the world on the other side or they have like kids running around stuff like that you know so F you to them and people that like to um

2348
02:27:53,402 --> 02:27:56,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess participating in idle chit chat in the grocery lines.

2349
02:27:57,043 --> 02:27:57,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2350
02:27:59,664 --> 02:28:03,606
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU of the week, I'm putting this in for Alan, goes to Del Taco.

2351
02:28:04,806 --> 02:28:09,448
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have a good reason because we actually went over to the drive-thru to get him a quick lunch that he could take on the train with him.

2352
02:28:09,788 --> 02:28:15,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we sat in the drive-thru for 35 minutes before we finally got our food and he missed his train as a result.

2353
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:21,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to have him here an extra day, but, you know, he had things he wanted to do.

2354
02:28:21,616 --> 02:28:25,240
[SPEAKER_10]: So, kind of irritating when they take a very, very long time.

2355
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:26,682
[SPEAKER_03]: What was their explanation?

2356
02:28:27,022 --> 02:28:27,863
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't really have one.

2357
02:28:28,484 --> 02:28:28,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2358
02:28:28,964 --> 02:28:29,725
[SPEAKER_10]: They were just busy.

2359
02:28:30,786 --> 02:28:30,907
Ow.

2360
02:28:31,888 --> 02:28:32,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

2361
02:28:32,989 --> 02:28:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So, otherwise, F you to the fact I have to get up at 6 in the morning tomorrow.

2362
02:28:37,093 --> 02:28:37,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

2363
02:28:38,334 --> 02:28:38,654
[SPEAKER_10]: When?

2364
02:28:39,374 --> 02:28:39,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Sad.

2365
02:28:40,174 --> 02:28:41,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any FUs of the week, Rice Princess?

2366
02:28:42,575 --> 02:28:47,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, FU to Everything 3D and FU to Stinky Farts.

2367
02:28:48,997 --> 02:28:49,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

2368
02:28:49,497 --> 02:28:50,257
[SPEAKER_03]: That about covers it.

2369
02:28:51,477 --> 02:28:51,957
[SPEAKER_18]: The Doctor.

2370
02:28:52,557 --> 02:28:54,978
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to 3D as well because I hate 3D forever.

2371
02:28:55,338 --> 02:28:55,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Found it.

2372
02:28:56,558 --> 02:28:57,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Explosion.

2373
02:28:57,559 --> 02:29:01,280
[SPEAKER_18]: And also FU to American TV for not having as many gay kisses as British TV.

2374
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:02,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Bring on the gay kisses, American TV.

2375
02:29:04,830 --> 02:29:06,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll show you a gay kiss right now.

2376
02:29:06,471 --> 02:29:09,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, they really kissed.

2377
02:29:10,553 --> 02:29:11,173
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it.

2378
02:29:12,594 --> 02:29:14,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, they totally kissed.

2379
02:29:14,515 --> 02:29:14,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2380
02:29:16,436 --> 02:29:22,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Laundry.

2381
02:29:22,279 --> 02:29:23,600
[SPEAKER_10]: I should probably boot Skype, huh?

2382
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:25,401
[SPEAKER_10]: But not yet because we still got two more stories to go.

2383
02:29:26,297 --> 02:29:37,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, who would have thought that D3 would announce that they're releasing Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

2384
02:29:39,122 --> 02:29:42,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's wonderful news that I wish I knew earlier.

2385
02:29:43,223 --> 02:29:43,664
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

2386
02:30:01,482 --> 02:30:02,043
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2387
02:30:18,098 --> 02:30:18,859
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just fun, though.

2388
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:20,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And this game looks fun, too.

2389
02:30:20,381 --> 02:30:22,664
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to take place now in New Detroit.

2390
02:30:23,124 --> 02:30:24,285
[SPEAKER_09]: The graphics are updated.

2391
02:30:24,666 --> 02:30:30,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the screenshot, it looks like we get the jetpack from number two, which is pretty awesome.

2392
02:30:30,613 --> 02:30:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am very looking forward to this game.

2393
02:30:32,655 --> 02:30:33,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be coming out in February.

2394
02:30:35,298 --> 02:30:53,796
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says the game is doomed and he actually says doomed it's gonna be awesome I don't care well I had no idea this game was gonna be coming out and I'm really happy that no one seemed to care that Loki you know Loki is saying this for the very first time I mean on this program

2395
02:30:55,230 --> 02:31:01,195
[SPEAKER_10]: One more news story for you guys, and it has to do with a new world record in video games.

2396
02:31:01,635 --> 02:31:03,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And the winner is Mafia 2.

2397
02:31:04,537 --> 02:31:05,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

2398
02:31:05,278 --> 02:31:06,859
[SPEAKER_10]: And what did Mafia 2 get?

2399
02:31:07,279 --> 02:31:13,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Mafia 2 uses the word fuck more than any other video game.

2400
02:31:13,904 --> 02:31:14,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

2401
02:31:14,724 --> 02:31:15,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

2402
02:31:15,985 --> 02:31:19,986
[SPEAKER_10]: They won the award for most swearing in a video game.

2403
02:31:20,247 --> 02:31:20,827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2404
02:31:20,887 --> 02:31:21,747
[SPEAKER_10]: The fuck they did.

2405
02:31:23,228 --> 02:31:29,110
[SPEAKER_10]: House of the Dead Overkill was the previous title that had 189 uses of the word fuck.

2406
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:29,610
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2407
02:31:30,011 --> 02:31:32,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, fuck or fucking or motherfucker.

2408
02:31:32,812 --> 02:31:33,692
[SPEAKER_10]: House of the Dead?

2409
02:31:33,912 --> 02:31:37,794
[SPEAKER_10]: But now, apparently... It's the new Wii game.

2410
02:31:38,094 --> 02:31:39,735
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii game that came out a couple years ago.

2411
02:31:39,855 --> 02:31:40,015
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2412
02:31:40,655 --> 02:31:45,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Mafia 2 has more than 200 instances of... Let me interrupt you again, robot.

2413
02:31:45,641 --> 02:31:45,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.

2414
02:31:47,484 --> 02:31:48,204
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck did you say?

2415
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:50,027
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't hear, I was talking.

2416
02:31:51,448 --> 02:31:52,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

2417
02:31:52,708 --> 02:31:59,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you guys, that's just really immature to say fuck as many times as possible in a short period.

2418
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:00,670
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really immature.

2419
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:04,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we've never had a fuck show.

2420
02:32:04,291 --> 02:32:04,571
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

2421
02:32:04,611 --> 02:32:11,873
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be extremely fucking immature and we would never do anything like that because we're intelligent gamers.

2422
02:32:12,293 --> 02:32:12,953
[SPEAKER_10]: We're classy.

2423
02:32:13,053 --> 02:32:13,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop saying fuck.

2424
02:32:15,455 --> 02:32:17,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Classy like the Playboys that were in Mafia 2.

2425
02:32:17,577 --> 02:32:19,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you give us a call and we'll talk.

2426
02:32:19,538 --> 02:32:23,901
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2427
02:32:24,361 --> 02:32:26,743
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll let Rice Princess answer all the calls tonight.

2428
02:32:26,763 --> 02:32:27,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that sound like fun?

2429
02:32:27,463 --> 02:32:28,444
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to answer the calls tonight?

2430
02:32:28,624 --> 02:32:29,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2431
02:32:29,085 --> 02:32:29,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

2432
02:32:29,505 --> 02:32:30,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm classy as fuck.

2433
02:32:30,906 --> 02:32:31,386
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2434
02:32:31,947 --> 02:32:34,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Rice Princess is going to answer all the calls for us tonight.

2435
02:32:34,549 --> 02:32:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2436
02:32:34,829 --> 02:32:40,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So call and talk to Rice Princess at 1-877-GAME-OLR and she will talk to our listeners.

2437
02:32:41,335 --> 02:32:43,476
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't ask me anything stupid.

2438
02:32:44,196 --> 02:32:45,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll jump in and help if you need it.

2439
02:32:45,596 --> 02:32:45,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2440
02:32:46,096 --> 02:32:47,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll answer the stupid questions.

2441
02:32:47,517 --> 02:32:47,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2442
02:32:47,837 --> 02:32:49,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Just say, Rob, this is a stupid question.

2443
02:32:49,577 --> 02:32:51,277
[SPEAKER_10]: No, don't make the listeners feel bad.

2444
02:32:51,437 --> 02:32:55,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just give you a signal like, Rob, this is a stupid question?

2445
02:32:56,019 --> 02:32:56,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

2446
02:32:56,819 --> 02:32:57,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2447
02:32:57,199 --> 02:32:57,719
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here we go.

2448
02:32:57,739 --> 02:32:58,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a call coming in.

2449
02:32:58,519 --> 02:32:58,779
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

2450
02:32:59,179 --> 02:32:59,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2451
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:00,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2452
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:02,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on OLR person.

2453
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:03,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2454
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:05,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Select the Zaku right here.

2455
02:33:05,401 --> 02:33:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2456
02:33:05,901 --> 02:33:05,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2457
02:33:07,082 --> 02:33:08,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know.

2458
02:33:08,303 --> 02:33:11,006
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought Sky was going to be on, but... Oh, sorry.

2459
02:33:11,386 --> 02:33:12,847
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a stupid question, Rob.

2460
02:33:12,867 --> 02:33:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you should take over.

2461
02:33:13,908 --> 02:33:21,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I did IMU within the chat, and I have good reason to be here tonight.

2462
02:33:21,895 --> 02:33:23,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, what's your good reason?

2463
02:33:24,157 --> 02:33:29,442
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I actually attended that Halo Reach launch party that Best Buy threw last week, you know, in the city.

2464
02:33:29,943 --> 02:33:31,124
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually got in as VIP.

2465
02:33:32,898 --> 02:33:35,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, how did you get in as VIP, Fancy Pants?

2466
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:38,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just say it's through the company I work for.

2467
02:33:39,683 --> 02:33:41,424
[SPEAKER_17]: And they actually do business for Best Buy.

2468
02:33:41,444 --> 02:33:44,827
[SPEAKER_17]: They actually build some of their apps for stuff like Reward Zone.

2469
02:33:44,867 --> 02:33:46,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So you had to give a reach around for reach?

2470
02:33:47,341 --> 02:33:48,442
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I actually got in.

2471
02:33:49,223 --> 02:33:51,024
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually got in through those connections.

2472
02:33:51,064 --> 02:33:56,729
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, pretty much it was just typical fanfare launch party with a lot of people trying to get in VIP.

2473
02:33:57,349 --> 02:34:02,574
[SPEAKER_17]: But most of the folks, all it was is just like playing Halo Reach before midnight.

2474
02:34:02,634 --> 02:34:04,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what did the VIP people get?

2475
02:34:04,916 --> 02:34:05,316
[SPEAKER_10]: What made you...

2476
02:34:06,477 --> 02:34:07,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I already know.

2477
02:34:08,038 --> 02:34:10,020
[SPEAKER_10]: You're VIP because you listen to this show.

2478
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:15,003
[SPEAKER_10]: But what did VIP get that the little peons waiting in line did not get?

2479
02:34:15,063 --> 02:34:16,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get the strip bus?

2480
02:34:16,424 --> 02:34:17,505
[SPEAKER_17]: A full-service bar.

2481
02:34:17,565 --> 02:34:19,146
[SPEAKER_17]: We had our own balcony section.

2482
02:34:19,867 --> 02:34:22,509
[SPEAKER_17]: A full-service bar.

2483
02:34:22,909 --> 02:34:23,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, exactly.

2484
02:34:25,663 --> 02:34:26,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we had a full bar.

2485
02:34:27,264 --> 02:34:28,305
[SPEAKER_10]: So how many people were there?

2486
02:34:28,645 --> 02:34:31,186
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they do that was... Did they have, like, a rock concert?

2487
02:34:31,206 --> 02:34:31,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2488
02:34:31,486 --> 02:34:31,907
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they do?

2489
02:34:31,967 --> 02:34:32,907
[SPEAKER_10]: A rock concert?

2490
02:34:32,947 --> 02:34:40,852
[SPEAKER_17]: There was one person, I forgot his name, Kid Cudi or something, who was supposed to have played, but he didn't play exactly, you know, before midnight.

2491
02:34:41,232 --> 02:34:45,354
[SPEAKER_17]: But by the time, you know, we left after midnight, he actually got on stage.

2492
02:34:45,374 --> 02:34:54,820
[SPEAKER_17]: There's something about him just, like, being, you know, the unprofessional artist that he... He opened for Lady Gaga once when I saw her, and he's that guy, he just...

2493
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:56,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Day and Night.

2494
02:34:56,562 --> 02:34:57,383
[SPEAKER_12]: That's him, right?

2495
02:34:57,403 --> 02:34:59,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, something like that.

2496
02:34:59,045 --> 02:34:59,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

2497
02:34:59,706 --> 02:35:01,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, he had the crap song in DJ Hero.

2498
02:35:03,601 --> 02:35:04,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Day and Night

2499
02:35:31,801 --> 02:35:32,521
[SPEAKER_17]: on a Monday night.

2500
02:35:33,102 --> 02:35:33,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there strippers?

2501
02:35:35,023 --> 02:35:46,892
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there weren't any strippers, unless you count all the fanboys that were actually donning Halo clothing, such as the plasma swords and whatnot.

2502
02:35:47,212 --> 02:35:49,974
[SPEAKER_10]: How many women were in line for Halo Reach compared to men?

2503
02:35:49,994 --> 02:35:51,696
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a lot of people outside, actually.

2504
02:35:51,796 --> 02:35:53,517
[SPEAKER_17]: It was literally stretching around the block.

2505
02:35:53,537 --> 02:35:53,617
[SPEAKER_17]: He's

2506
02:35:54,397 --> 02:35:57,618
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were outside and not actually in the line waiting to buy the game, right?

2507
02:35:57,638 --> 02:35:58,338
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they were still inside, though.

2508
02:35:58,358 --> 02:36:00,379
[SPEAKER_17]: There were people waiting to get in.

2509
02:36:00,419 --> 02:36:02,599
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the thing.

2510
02:36:02,639 --> 02:36:05,860
[SPEAKER_10]: But you got to sit up on the balcony and just judge them all, right?

2511
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:07,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, because you know what?

2512
02:36:08,081 --> 02:36:09,921
[SPEAKER_17]: I was connected.

2513
02:36:10,321 --> 02:36:11,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, I work for the company.

2514
02:36:12,122 --> 02:36:15,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Our company does business with Best Buy, and so they hooked us up.

2515
02:36:15,903 --> 02:36:16,703
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank them for that.

2516
02:36:17,637 --> 02:36:19,759
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me guess, you're talking about U-Beat.

2517
02:36:42,523 --> 02:36:50,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, on the iPad, which makes a lot of sense given the fact that it's touch-based and the platform is there.

2518
02:36:50,612 --> 02:37:01,704
[SPEAKER_17]: That means arcade owners, as much as I respect them, they won't have to shell out tons of money for something that may or may not succeed on that medium.

2519
02:37:02,164 --> 02:37:04,667
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

2520
02:37:07,310 --> 02:37:07,750
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good.

2521
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:14,553
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's a good... Look, I'm more of an Android developer, but even though I have an iPod Touch, I do respect the platform.

2522
02:37:15,454 --> 02:37:18,515
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't like the way they... You know, I don't like Apple's censoring.

2523
02:37:18,655 --> 02:37:21,076
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do you think they'll charge for Ubeat?

2524
02:37:21,256 --> 02:37:21,677
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 cents?

2525
02:37:21,697 --> 02:37:21,677
$4.99?

2526
02:37:22,217 --> 02:37:24,398
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty certain it'll be $5 at most.

2527
02:37:24,418 --> 02:37:24,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what they'll do?

2528
02:37:25,018 --> 02:37:28,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you it's like 99 cents and then like a dollar a song.

2529
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:29,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, exactly.

2530
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:30,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Like they're doing with DDRS.

2531
02:37:30,881 --> 02:37:31,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Gross.

2532
02:37:31,974 --> 02:37:36,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but any other thoughts on the Halo Reach party?

2533
02:37:36,959 --> 02:37:41,743
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could sum up the Halo Reach launch party in your VIP access in one word, what would it be?

2534
02:37:42,043 --> 02:37:42,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Sausage.

2535
02:37:45,967 --> 02:37:47,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn good time for free.

2536
02:37:48,109 --> 02:37:48,789
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too many words!

2537
02:37:49,390 --> 02:37:49,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night.

2538
02:37:50,511 --> 02:37:51,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, night.

2539
02:37:53,142 --> 02:38:01,046
[SPEAKER_10]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call and tell us about your VIP treatment and full service.

2540
02:38:01,286 --> 02:38:01,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.

2541
02:38:02,066 --> 02:38:04,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, right?

2542
02:38:09,029 --> 02:38:11,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2543
02:38:12,130 --> 02:38:12,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2544
02:38:14,291 --> 02:38:14,871
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Con.

2545
02:38:15,651 --> 02:38:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, whatever you said.

2546
02:38:18,892 --> 02:38:19,973
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your question?

2547
02:38:21,701 --> 02:38:36,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering if you guys had heard about the Fable 3 book that's going to be published Cool, continue No, he asked a question, dummy Cool, continue The Fable 3 book What about it?

2548
02:38:37,293 --> 02:38:40,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know much about this either, tell us about it It's like a fantasy book?

2549
02:38:42,557 --> 02:38:47,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's actually not Fable 3 It's going to be taking place between Fable 2 and Fable 3

2550
02:38:54,272 --> 02:39:00,314
[SPEAKER_10]: What's to stop me from going into Barnes & Noble and just copying the code from the book and running home and cashing it in before someone else can?

2551
02:39:01,074 --> 02:39:03,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Rude.

2552
02:39:04,955 --> 02:39:08,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they have it in plastic wrap or something and you, I don't know, set off alarms.

2553
02:39:09,017 --> 02:39:11,357
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll set off an alarm if you break the seal.

2554
02:39:11,437 --> 02:39:12,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2555
02:39:12,758 --> 02:39:14,638
[SPEAKER_10]: The Master Chief comes down and blows your head off.

2556
02:39:15,298 --> 02:39:15,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Close range.

2557
02:39:16,659 --> 02:39:17,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God.

2558
02:39:19,266 --> 02:39:20,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you a big fan of Fable?

2559
02:39:21,206 --> 02:39:22,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious about this new game.

2560
02:39:22,807 --> 02:39:27,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it didn't seem that different from 2, from what I played, but I heard they really improved co-op.

2561
02:39:28,708 --> 02:39:30,848
[SPEAKER_20]: I am really jealous that you did get to play it.

2562
02:39:32,189 --> 02:39:34,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I am a pretty big Fable fan.

2563
02:39:34,649 --> 02:39:45,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you, when I played it, Kine, I ran around in a giant chicken suit for like 10 minutes, and I had no idea what I was doing, and I felt like I was playing Furries the game.

2564
02:39:47,012 --> 02:39:47,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

2565
02:39:48,939 --> 02:39:51,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, just the one time, just the one time I think it would be funny

2566
02:40:07,543 --> 02:40:09,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, funny and arousing.

2567
02:40:14,247 --> 02:40:21,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that there's enough fable mythos out there and enough world that they've constructed out of the games that will make for pretty decent fantasy novels?

2568
02:40:22,052 --> 02:40:25,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, it's not like novels for video games is anything too new.

2569
02:40:25,094 --> 02:40:27,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Warcraft has a bunch of them.

2570
02:40:27,355 --> 02:40:28,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Even Halo has novels.

2571
02:40:29,056 --> 02:40:29,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil.

2572
02:40:29,716 --> 02:40:30,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident Evil.

2573
02:40:30,417 --> 02:40:35,160
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of games, the FX9 novels back in the day, Castlevania, Blaster Master, heck yeah.

2574
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:37,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

2575
02:40:37,721 --> 02:40:40,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there enough substance in Fable to lend itself to books?

2576
02:40:40,884 --> 02:40:41,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you think?

2577
02:40:43,065 --> 02:40:43,825
[SPEAKER_20]: There should be.

2578
02:40:45,006 --> 02:40:50,570
[SPEAKER_20]: And besides, they have someone from, I think it was Wizards of the Coast, writing the novel.

2579
02:40:50,610 --> 02:40:53,572
[SPEAKER_20]: The makers of, like, Dungeons and Dragons, I think.

2580
02:40:54,850 --> 02:40:58,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and now Irene likes Dungeons & Dragons, so maybe you should get... Why don't you play Fable?

2581
02:40:58,751 --> 02:40:59,571
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually kind of neat.

2582
02:40:59,591 --> 02:41:00,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2583
02:41:00,732 --> 02:41:02,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm too busy playing D&D.

2584
02:41:02,332 --> 02:41:03,712
[SPEAKER_03]: What a good answer!

2585
02:41:04,853 --> 02:41:06,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you put me on the spot, okay, you asshole?

2586
02:41:07,293 --> 02:41:08,414
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we do here on the show.

2587
02:41:08,434 --> 02:41:12,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's expensive and not a lot of people have the money to turn off on a $60 game.

2588
02:41:12,955 --> 02:41:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what console is it for?

2589
02:41:14,595 --> 02:41:16,916
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for the... It's for the Xbox 360, your favorite.

2590
02:41:17,202 --> 02:41:18,403
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your answer.

2591
02:41:19,944 --> 02:41:20,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, ding.

2592
02:41:20,665 --> 02:41:21,706
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not my fault you're poor.

2593
02:41:22,126 --> 02:41:22,426
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2594
02:41:22,446 --> 02:41:23,647
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my fault you're an asshole.

2595
02:41:23,867 --> 02:41:24,368
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2596
02:41:24,708 --> 02:41:25,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And you smell.

2597
02:41:27,230 --> 02:41:28,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what else I want to ask Kaim.

2598
02:41:28,551 --> 02:41:28,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2599
02:41:29,552 --> 02:41:32,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Quickly, anything else you're looking forward to this holiday season?

2600
02:41:39,860 --> 02:41:45,264
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not looking forward to anything until next year when Metal Gear Rising comes out.

2601
02:41:46,166 --> 02:41:48,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, that is going to be a very popular game.

2602
02:41:48,247 --> 02:41:50,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So no interest in the motion control stuff.

2603
02:41:51,028 --> 02:41:52,588
[SPEAKER_10]: No Kinect, no Move in your future?

2604
02:41:54,329 --> 02:42:00,871
[SPEAKER_20]: When they come out with the Kinect feature in Fable 3 where I'm able to growth the other player, sure.

2605
02:42:03,312 --> 02:42:03,692
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2606
02:42:04,352 --> 02:42:05,153
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll leave it at that.

2607
02:42:05,253 --> 02:42:06,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, Kine.

2608
02:42:06,213 --> 02:42:07,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for the call.

2609
02:42:08,014 --> 02:42:08,594
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you around.

2610
02:42:08,614 --> 02:42:09,334
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you guys.

2611
02:42:10,137 --> 02:42:10,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Later, you too.

2612
02:42:10,837 --> 02:42:11,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

2613
02:42:11,717 --> 02:42:12,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2614
02:42:35,442 --> 02:42:35,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2615
02:42:35,822 --> 02:42:42,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, wow nerd, the Tauren actually had an ability called Planes Runner in the early days of WoW.

2616
02:42:43,104 --> 02:42:43,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

2617
02:42:43,885 --> 02:42:49,506
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, where they could actually be the mounts themselves, but they were patched in with Kodos in a later expansion.

2618
02:42:49,726 --> 02:42:51,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't druids kind of like that too?

2619
02:42:51,367 --> 02:42:53,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they can just have their own flying shit?

2620
02:42:54,468 --> 02:42:54,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2621
02:42:54,908 --> 02:42:55,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2622
02:42:55,108 --> 02:42:56,928
[SPEAKER_10]: How about another call?

2623
02:42:56,968 --> 02:42:57,469
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, Irene?

2624
02:42:57,669 --> 02:42:58,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2625
02:42:59,264 --> 02:42:59,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Ryan!

2626
02:43:01,365 --> 02:43:02,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn.

2627
02:43:02,706 --> 02:43:03,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

2628
02:43:03,846 --> 02:43:05,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm booting you from the guild.

2629
02:43:05,947 --> 02:43:06,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

2630
02:43:06,867 --> 02:43:08,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll GK you quicker than you could me.

2631
02:43:09,568 --> 02:43:11,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, in fact, look, I'm on the game right now.

2632
02:43:11,549 --> 02:43:12,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2633
02:43:12,890 --> 02:43:14,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Radio 101, real quick, Irene.

2634
02:43:14,771 --> 02:43:21,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though their name comes up on the screen, you're supposed to, for radio's sake, just play stupid and say, Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2635
02:43:21,334 --> 02:43:21,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is this?

2636
02:43:21,834 --> 02:43:24,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though you can clearly see his name is Ryan B.,

2637
02:43:25,427 --> 02:43:26,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2638
02:43:26,311 --> 02:43:27,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds weird on the radio.

2639
02:43:27,756 --> 02:43:29,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, his name is Ryan B?

2640
02:43:29,322 --> 02:43:30,085
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2641
02:43:30,105 --> 02:43:30,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

2642
02:43:31,129 --> 02:43:31,329
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2643
02:43:32,045 --> 02:43:33,746
[SPEAKER_15]: You're giving away personal information there.

2644
02:43:33,786 --> 02:43:35,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to give away the whole thing.

2645
02:43:35,447 --> 02:43:36,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't say the whole thing.

2646
02:43:36,848 --> 02:43:39,470
[SPEAKER_10]: But take it off your Skype info.

2647
02:43:39,490 --> 02:43:44,594
[SPEAKER_10]: You can all see it in our studio.

2648
02:43:44,974 --> 02:43:46,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Because otherwise you sound like Miss Cleo.

2649
02:43:47,296 --> 02:43:49,897
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because I am Chad.

2650
02:43:49,938 --> 02:43:52,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I already know your name, Chad.

2651
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:55,621
[SPEAKER_10]: How can I help you today, Ryan?

2652
02:43:56,742 --> 02:43:59,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Another reference that most of your listeners probably don't get, Rob.

2653
02:43:59,762 --> 02:44:00,162
[SPEAKER_18]: It's true.

2654
02:44:00,182 --> 02:44:01,343
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, Miss Cleo, who?

2655
02:44:01,603 --> 02:44:02,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, right?

2656
02:44:02,764 --> 02:44:03,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Indeed.

2657
02:44:03,024 --> 02:44:03,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

2658
02:44:03,644 --> 02:44:04,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, Irene.

2659
02:44:04,425 --> 02:44:04,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2660
02:44:05,025 --> 02:44:05,846
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want, Ryan?

2661
02:44:06,886 --> 02:44:07,127
[SPEAKER_10]: You.

2662
02:44:09,808 --> 02:44:10,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Gasp.

2663
02:44:11,109 --> 02:44:11,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Drama.

2664
02:44:12,390 --> 02:44:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what do you really want besides me, everyone?

2665
02:44:15,191 --> 02:44:15,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Me.

2666
02:44:17,473 --> 02:44:18,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the truth right there.

2667
02:44:18,894 --> 02:44:19,354
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, come on.

2668
02:44:19,394 --> 02:44:19,694
[SPEAKER_10]: No, really.

2669
02:44:19,714 --> 02:44:20,955
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want?

2670
02:44:21,135 --> 02:44:21,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.

2671
02:44:21,635 --> 02:44:25,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just calling in to see how excited you are about Civ V coming out this coming Tuesday.

2672
02:44:26,656 --> 02:44:31,779
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I am not excited to spend $50 on a game I'll probably play twice.

2673
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:37,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of the stupid WoW and all the stupid time sink I spent on that game.

2674
02:44:38,544 --> 02:44:39,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love my guildies.

2675
02:44:40,105 --> 02:44:43,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I see how much you've been spending time on my gift for you.

2676
02:44:43,827 --> 02:44:44,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, right?

2677
02:44:44,968 --> 02:44:46,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how much I've played StarCraft 2?

2678
02:44:46,949 --> 02:44:47,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Not enough.

2679
02:44:47,789 --> 02:44:49,090
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I understand that completely.

2680
02:44:49,571 --> 02:44:50,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Not enough.

2681
02:44:50,231 --> 02:44:52,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Very time consuming, especially with everything coming out now for it.

2682
02:44:52,993 --> 02:44:53,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2683
02:44:53,473 --> 02:45:10,436
[SPEAKER_10]: the bummer with starting a late raiding schedule like our guild did is that like now we don't have that little like usually raiding kind of comes in cycles and the content first comes out you raid it a million times and then it kind of dies off and that's your time to go play other games we haven't had that

2684
02:45:11,456 --> 02:45:32,081
[SPEAKER_16]: so if I want to go play like you know what the word late and raid is all in the same sentence I mean you guys what 8 o'clock your time by the time I get out of it it's about 3.30 in the morning for me not my fault you joined the West Coast Guild alright anyway for the listeners that don't play WoW is there anything else on your mind tonight?

2685
02:45:32,682 --> 02:45:37,225
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the whole, the good old gaming, GOG, that's a whole ruse.

2686
02:45:37,385 --> 02:45:43,269
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll figure that out, come by Wednesday when they announce that they're actually taking their stuff out of beta and actually going live.

2687
02:45:43,309 --> 02:45:48,372
[SPEAKER_16]: There has been reports now that it's claiming that it has been all been one big ruse.

2688
02:45:48,492 --> 02:45:52,154
[SPEAKER_16]: And now they're probably going to pay dearly for what they did to all their paying customers.

2689
02:45:52,294 --> 02:45:53,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they dicks or are they dicks?

2690
02:45:53,095 --> 02:45:57,878
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope they have something in store for them because a lot of people are going to still be upset by all that.

2691
02:45:59,389 --> 02:46:00,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to be upset?

2692
02:46:00,290 --> 02:46:01,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to boycott their website?

2693
02:46:01,871 --> 02:46:03,253
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm never shopping here again.

2694
02:46:03,793 --> 02:46:04,634
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not really.

2695
02:46:04,654 --> 02:46:06,276
[SPEAKER_16]: I never bought anything from them in the first place.

2696
02:46:06,296 --> 02:46:07,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

2697
02:46:08,458 --> 02:46:12,081
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet you, like, half of the games that they have, I already have.

2698
02:46:12,201 --> 02:46:19,388
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, like the Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, all the old games, I'll buy Dirt Keep anyway, so I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

2699
02:46:20,339 --> 02:46:20,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2700
02:46:20,739 --> 02:46:21,820
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, people are going to.

2701
02:46:21,900 --> 02:46:22,781
[SPEAKER_16]: People are going to be like that.

2702
02:46:22,821 --> 02:46:24,482
[SPEAKER_16]: People are going to be like, why did you pull this on us?

2703
02:46:24,682 --> 02:46:26,163
[SPEAKER_16]: We thought you were being for real.

2704
02:46:26,183 --> 02:46:30,145
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of people didn't know what was really going on and now you do this.

2705
02:46:30,245 --> 02:46:32,247
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's like, well, you know, screw you.

2706
02:46:32,307 --> 02:46:35,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll find another place to buy the game or torrent or whatever, so.

2707
02:46:36,913 --> 02:46:45,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claw in chat says, I'm really curious to hear how Rob sounds like while playing WoW.

2708
02:46:45,044 --> 02:46:45,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how he acts.

2709
02:46:46,045 --> 02:46:48,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it's not like that Onyxia wipe guy.

2710
02:46:48,669 --> 02:46:53,194
[SPEAKER_10]: How do I sound playing WoW, Ryan, since you've been on Ventrilo with me playing World of Warcraft?

2711
02:46:55,464 --> 02:46:56,584
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding.

2712
02:46:56,604 --> 02:46:57,785
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you sound like you do now.

2713
02:46:59,826 --> 02:47:02,427
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like we pretty much, you know, it's normal.

2714
02:47:02,607 --> 02:47:05,449
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, nobody gets really too crazy in there.

2715
02:47:05,469 --> 02:47:07,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like to do my wacky DJ voice.

2716
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:10,071
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you do not do your wacky DJ voice.

2717
02:47:10,091 --> 02:47:12,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, everybody, let's go to the summoning stone.

2718
02:47:12,692 --> 02:47:13,492
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2720
02:47:46,198 --> 02:47:46,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I love WoW calls.

2721
02:47:47,639 --> 02:47:48,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

2722
02:47:48,639 --> 02:47:55,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's not enough WoW chat on this show that I want to start a whole other WoW show because there's not enough of them.

2723
02:47:55,443 --> 02:47:59,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope there's people out there that would listen to a Robin Extra for a WoW show.

2724
02:47:59,545 --> 02:48:00,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I might.

2725
02:48:00,626 --> 02:48:01,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2726
02:48:01,226 --> 02:48:02,147
[SPEAKER_03]: At least we'd have half a listener.

2727
02:48:02,207 --> 02:48:03,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't I confident?

2728
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:03,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2729
02:48:04,508 --> 02:48:05,268
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2730
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:08,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2731
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:11,532
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, you should celebrate this call by having a cupcake.

2732
02:48:14,429 --> 02:48:15,750
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a total inside joke.

2733
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:16,390
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very rude.

2734
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:17,851
[SPEAKER_10]: That's brilliant.

2735
02:48:17,951 --> 02:48:18,772
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very rude.

2736
02:48:19,012 --> 02:48:19,832
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready for another call?

2737
02:48:19,933 --> 02:48:20,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2738
02:48:22,014 --> 02:48:24,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you've reached Orange Slut Radio.

2739
02:48:25,556 --> 02:48:26,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is this?

2740
02:48:27,257 --> 02:48:28,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Dazzy Neater.

2741
02:48:29,519 --> 02:48:31,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's up?

2742
02:48:33,221 --> 02:48:42,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just want to pass along a little tidbit, a bit of information to whatever listeners there are out there that's not in chat.

2743
02:48:44,179 --> 02:48:52,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's an anime show that I just discovered called Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.

2744
02:48:52,963 --> 02:48:53,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Just now?

2745
02:48:55,344 --> 02:49:01,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I just discovered Hoarders, and that's been on for like a year and a half, and I'm just finding out about it.

2746
02:49:01,667 --> 02:49:02,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know what?

2747
02:49:02,507 --> 02:49:02,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Back off.

2748
02:49:03,108 --> 02:49:03,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Judging you.

2749
02:49:04,788 --> 02:49:05,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, continue.

2750
02:49:05,909 --> 02:49:06,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

2751
02:49:07,309 --> 02:49:12,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I just discovered Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood myself.

2752
02:49:13,533 --> 02:49:24,661
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's basically like a remake of an earlier show with the same name and it's pretty damn good.

2753
02:49:26,222 --> 02:49:40,071
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I have no idea if it's on DVD or Blu-ray or anything like that but I happen to know that it is available for digital download.

2754
02:49:41,892 --> 02:49:42,613
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to

2755
02:49:43,496 --> 02:49:45,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like risk going that route.

2756
02:49:46,479 --> 02:50:01,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as I complained about digital download before, but at least right now, the first 13 episodes are actually on sale on PSN for like 99 cents each.

2757
02:50:03,874 --> 02:50:10,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap, but at the same time, if you guys have listened to my

2758
02:50:11,164 --> 02:50:16,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Calls a few months ago, there's kind of a risk with digital downloads.

2759
02:50:18,567 --> 02:50:20,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to take the risk, go for it.

2760
02:50:22,569 --> 02:50:25,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you want to save some money, go ahead.

2761
02:50:25,490 --> 02:50:30,953
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't think it's worth the risk, then look for a physical copy.

2762
02:50:32,653 --> 02:50:36,395
[SPEAKER_10]: So all together to get the whole series, it's like 14 bucks basically?

2763
02:50:36,415 --> 02:50:38,116
[SPEAKER_10]: What, 13 episodes, 99 cents a pop?

2764
02:50:40,012 --> 02:50:46,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's only the first half of the series that's on sale.

2765
02:50:47,157 --> 02:50:48,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like 25.

2766
02:50:48,718 --> 02:50:49,679
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they get you.

2767
02:50:49,979 --> 02:50:54,782
[SPEAKER_10]: They sucker you in to buy the first half, and then they're like, oh, but the second half is double the price.

2768
02:50:56,604 --> 02:50:57,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly like that, Rob.

2769
02:50:58,705 --> 02:51:00,226
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do at Sony headquarters.

2770
02:51:02,395 --> 02:51:09,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the weird thing is, though, you know, I'm not totally sure how Microsoft does their video marketplace.

2771
02:51:09,277 --> 02:51:10,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I really haven't used it yet.

2772
02:51:11,398 --> 02:51:21,601
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know at least over on PSN, you know, a lot of times they'll have, like, weekly sales on certain things, you know, wherever it's half off for that week.

2773
02:51:22,582 --> 02:51:28,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times they even give away, like, pilots to shows, you know,

2774
02:51:29,787 --> 02:51:48,426
[SPEAKER_01]: for free, and the whole thing, you know, hey, you know, this pilot that I got for free is good, you know, might as well buy the rest of the series, you know, but, you know, like I said, there's, you know, you know, the inherent risk of your system fucks up, you know, uh,

2775
02:51:49,909 --> 02:51:55,894
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a chance that unless you play your cards right, you could lose out on the content that you bought.

2776
02:51:55,954 --> 02:51:58,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to demand to speak to a supervisor, correct?

2777
02:51:58,457 --> 02:52:02,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Based on what I learned in your previous calls about Sony Trauma.

2778
02:52:04,101 --> 02:52:12,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, luckily, at least in the situations I've been in, I may have to work it out.

2779
02:52:14,570 --> 02:52:16,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said earlier in the call, it's

2780
02:52:18,247 --> 02:52:19,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Way out the pros and cons.

2781
02:52:20,229 --> 02:52:22,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a solution to all of your Microsoft problems, by the way.

2782
02:52:23,171 --> 02:52:24,332
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Sony problems, though.

2783
02:52:24,572 --> 02:52:25,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony problems, whatever.

2784
02:52:26,714 --> 02:52:27,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Hook up a computer to your TV.

2785
02:52:29,095 --> 02:52:29,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

2786
02:52:29,876 --> 02:52:30,537
[SPEAKER_05]: No more problem.

2787
02:52:31,197 --> 02:52:31,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It works for us.

2788
02:52:32,518 --> 02:52:34,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you a question?

2789
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:36,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to completely derail what you were saying.

2790
02:52:36,961 --> 02:52:37,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you from?

2791
02:52:39,003 --> 02:52:39,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Buffalo, New York.

2792
02:52:40,164 --> 02:52:40,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2793
02:52:42,045 --> 02:52:43,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to place your accent.

2794
02:52:44,608 --> 02:52:53,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the weird thing is my accent is not typical, though, because to get a little personal, I'm half Canadian.

2795
02:52:53,954 --> 02:52:59,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone on my mother's side of the family is Canadian, and I spend a lot of time around my Canadian relatives.

2796
02:52:59,737 --> 02:53:01,658
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't like Canadians in these parts.

2797
02:53:02,959 --> 02:53:06,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so my accent is a blend of Canadian.

2798
02:53:07,287 --> 02:53:34,602
[SPEAKER_10]: The Buffalonian accent and the Canadian accent That's very cool because I was trying to I was actually thinking Great Lakes area but that's actually kind of close I don't want no damn Tim Hortons in my backyard I'm sorry to completely derail what you said but I've been trying to place it for several calls now We've got to say goodbye to Spazinator for now because we've got to go and wrap up But Spazinator, thank you for the deal alert and let's hope your PlayStation doesn't break again

2799
02:53:35,742 --> 02:53:36,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

2800
02:53:36,362 --> 02:53:36,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.

2801
02:54:03,444 --> 02:54:09,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know that there's actually an old Battlestar Galactica that they did back in the 70s?

2802
02:54:09,547 --> 02:54:10,727
[SPEAKER_10]: And Starbuck's a dude?

2803
02:54:11,448 --> 02:54:11,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2804
02:54:11,988 --> 02:54:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen any of the new episodes, only the old ones.

2805
02:54:14,449 --> 02:54:15,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the new ones are actually really good.

2806
02:54:15,770 --> 02:54:16,890
[SPEAKER_10]: They're super good.

2807
02:54:16,910 --> 02:54:18,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Starbuck cannot be a chick!

2808
02:54:18,831 --> 02:54:19,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love this.

2809
02:54:19,912 --> 02:54:21,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a coffee!

2810
02:54:21,272 --> 02:54:26,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, this was my favorite comment during that whole call when Irene answered the call.

2811
02:54:26,555 --> 02:54:29,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Izom says, Orange slut radio discusses anime.

2812
02:54:29,356 --> 02:54:31,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you sure this isn't Orange Virgin Radio?

2813
02:54:32,911 --> 02:54:35,113
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Orange Hentai Radio.

2814

[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2817
02:54:39,716 --> 02:54:41,097
[SPEAKER_05]: The R stands for rape.

2818
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:44,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2819
02:54:44,840 --> 02:54:47,702
[SPEAKER_10]: What is wrong with you?

2820
02:54:50,325 --> 02:54:52,969
[SPEAKER_10]: That's horribly inappropriate.

2821
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:55,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about tentacles.

2822
02:54:56,373 --> 02:55:00,399

2860
02:56:39,775 --> 02:56:41,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodbye to everyone.

2863
02:56:50,492 --> 02:56:52,973

02:56:54,795 --> 02:56:55,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?

2867
02:56:57,196 --> 02:56:59,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to charge my devices, they're all dead now.

2868
02:57:00,598 --> 02:57:01,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Jerks.

2869
02:57:01,478 --> 02:57:04,160
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is, I have to charge my life.

2870
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:05,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dead now.

2871
02:57:06,238 --> 02:57:07,238
[SPEAKER_10]: That was deep, Rob.

2872
02:57:07,298 --> 02:57:07,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

2873
02:57:07,819 --> 02:57:08,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Super deep.

2874
02:57:08,819 --> 02:57:09,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for listening.

2875
02:57:10,019 --> 02:57:11,000

2876
02:57:11,060 --> 02:57:12,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your support.

2877
02:57:12,180 --> 02:57:15,521
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like what you heard, all we ask, tell two people about the show.

2878
02:57:15,781 --> 02:57:17,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Help us spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.

2879
02:57:17,342 --> 02:57:22,283
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have any friends, which I highly doubt, but you can always also leave us nice reviews on iTunes.

2880
02:57:22,323 --> 02:57:23,043
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate that.

2881
02:57:23,183 --> 02:57:26,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Or any other place that discusses podcasts.

2882
02:57:27,665 --> 02:57:29,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Podcast Alley or whatever.

2883
02:57:29,485 --> 02:57:31,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Just any place where they're discussing podcasts.

2884
02:57:31,126 --> 02:57:31,266
[SPEAKER_10]: See you.

2885
02:57:31,906 --> 02:57:34,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Say a good word or two and help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2886
02:57:46,710 --> 02:57:55,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to download one that actually gets updated once a week or at least once a month because iTunes has some things that have been molding since 2007 still on the store.

2887
02:57:55,175 --> 02:57:56,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So just good luck with that.

2888
02:57:57,076 --> 02:57:58,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, thanks again.

2889
02:57:58,957 --> 02:58:00,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a wonderful night.

2890
02:58:00,578 --> 02:58:01,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next week.

2891
02:58:01,519 --> 02:58:04,400
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do this all over again with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2892
02:58:04,460 --> 02:58:06,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, good night.

2893
02:58:07,182 --> 02:58:09,983
[SPEAKER_19]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2894
02:58:10,503 --> 02:58:13,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2895
02:58:14,184 --> 02:58:22,826
[SPEAKER_19]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2896
02:58:23,346 --> 02:58:34,969
[SPEAKER_19]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2897
02:58:35,529 --> 02:58:36,369
[SPEAKER_19]: See you next week!

2898
02:58:38,446 --> 02:58:40,097
Thanks for watching!
