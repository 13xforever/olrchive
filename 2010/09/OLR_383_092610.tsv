118700	123920	And I don't know, I claim to have ESP or something, but Loki was actually reading Bobby's mind,
123920	124920	not mine.
124920	125920	I don't know.
125920	126920	It was dumb.
126920	127920	Like even repeating the story is really dumb.
127920	128920	Wouldn't that mean I have ESP?
128920	131480	That's because you're psycho and have ESPN.
131480	133040	This is really, really dumb.
133040	134040	For real.
134040	135040	For real, real.
135040	136040	For real.
136040	137040	Alright.
137040	140160	Rob, it's for reals, okay.

157680	162880	Rama says, I thought tonight was a repeat as many times as Jamie said crunchy lol.
162880	169200	No, it's, we're live here on this lovely September evening of 2008, no, I'm kidding.
169200	170200	Alright.
170200	175760	It's 2010 of course, we're live and we're going to talk about all the latest and greatest
175760	177120	in video games and all that.
177120	179880	But of course we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of
179880	181800	how was your gaming week?
181800	182800	Dark Sakura?
182800	183800	Crunchy the bagel queen?
183800	185500	How was your, how was your gaming week?
185500	188080	I love Plants vs. Zombies a lot.
188080	192320	Like I was supposed to go to bed at midnight a couple nights ago, so I was going to Apple
192320	193320	Hill on the weekend.
193320	194320	Okay, your mic is full of fail.
194320	195320	You gotta grab it.
195320	196320	Okay.
196320	197320	I got it.
197320	198320	Alright.
198320	199320	Nothing ever.
199320	204200	I had to go to bed early one night and cause we were going to Apple Hill the next day,
204200	207880	which is awesome and has lots of apple juice.
207880	209760	Apple Hill's awesome.
209760	210760	Yes.
210760	217940	Anyway, um, but instead of going to bed on time when I was supposed to, I was up for
217940	221440	three hours playing Plants vs. Zombies and didn't even realize how late I was up playing
221440	224840	Plants vs. Zombies and did it again yesterday.
224840	225900	And I love that game.
225900	231720	Plants vs. Zombies is freaking rad and then I played some Final Fantasy 13.
231720	234380	How many times can this dude say hero?
234380	240080	For those of, you know, our listeners that aren't local to the Sacramento area, Apple
240080	246920	Hill is a place a little bit up, um, I guess a little Eastern from us, um, it's Camino
246920	252720	California up the hill, I guess if you will, um, where they have a lot of apples and crafts
252720	258960	and stuff and, um, I mean the apple cider's awesome, but apple cider's, you know, awesome
258960	262240	all the time, but it's crafts.
262240	265680	No, they have lots of good organic markets there.
265680	266680	And a corn maze.
266680	270280	But, but, they don't have a corn maze.
270280	271280	They're just no corn.
271280	273320	Is that a maze maze?
273320	276440	They had a corn maze when I went there like years ago, like 10 years ago.
276440	278560	Well I had never been, okay?
278560	281480	I'm from Alabama where we have stuff like swamps.
281480	289760	Um, swamp hill, but they've got craft, the blueberry swamp is, there was a place there
289760	294400	that had a really good lamb burger of which I got lamb burger juice all over my hands
294400	296000	and wiped it off on a lamb.
296000	297760	Is there, is there a lamb?
297760	299040	That is sick.
299040	301800	PETA is going to be calling any minute now.
301800	302880	Here's your sister.
302880	303880	Come here.
303880	304880	That's gross.
304880	311920	And for the record, I went shopping at the organic market up there and I picked heirloom
311920	315680	tomatoes, fell down the hill.
315680	316920	My knee looks better than it did.
316920	318200	You took a tumble down apple hill.
318200	323640	Well, it was funny is that this is the awesome part.
323640	328080	This was the awesome part was that I, uh, when I fell on my knees, I really bruised
328080	330600	up my knee really bad, but I did not tear my jeans.
330600	334600	So you were a bruised apple hill.
334600	335600	She peels.
335600	336600	I'll be here all night, everybody.
336600	337600	But a bump.
337600	342600	Don't forget to tip your waitress.
342600	343600	Okay.
343600	344600	Indeed.
344600	348980	So I love how your gaming week is like, yeah, I play plan for zombies and a little more
348980	353040	fun fancy 13 and Oh my God, apples, apples, apples, apples, apples, and I'm not talking
353040	354040	max.
354040	355040	I got fudge.
355040	356040	Oh, congrats.
356040	359380	They do have an apple cider milkshake.
359380	360380	That's pretty good though.
360380	367680	We had lunch at the place has had the apple milkshakes and it's so good video games are
367680	368680	pretty cool.
368680	369800	Let's go to apple hill and pack some fudge.
369800	371880	Just like crunchy, the bagel queen.
371880	374000	We don't need to go to apple hill to do that.
374000	375000	All right.
375000	376000	All right.
376000	377000	You guys have earned it.
377000	379880	Hold on.
379880	381400	What I love is that your mic is so crappy.
381400	382400	It won't pick that thing up.
382400	383400	Anyway.
383400	384400	All right.
384400	385400	My mic is not crappy.
385400	388920	It's the swear bear in you have a swear bear.
388920	391600	What is a swear bear?
391600	397880	It's a bear that makes really obscene comments and it has two different settings on the back
397880	402140	of it has a switch, which I thought was an on off switch and for the longest time kept
402140	407120	saying kiss my ass instead of like all the, instead of all the wonderful things he normally
407120	412600	says, but like he will say of course kiss my ass and he'll say, um, eat shit and die
412600	417200	motherfucker, you know, but I have it on my desk and it just, it's a really cute looking
417200	422000	bear that says, hug me or press press me and like it's chest and some people are like,
422000	424000	Oh, it's a bear.
424000	426480	What the fuck did they just say to me?
426480	427480	I know.
427480	428480	Seriously.
428480	429480	Why do we not have a swear bear here in the studio?
429480	430480	I will bring it in next week.
430480	431480	You know what?
431480	432480	I'm not going to be here next week.
432480	433480	So I think that's too bad.
433480	434480	Why don't you have the swear?
434480	435920	Why don't you have the swear bear sit in for me next week?
435920	436920	I'm sorry.
436920	437920	I ate it.
437920	438920	Okay.
438920	439920	So.
439920	440920	Sure.
440920	441920	Loki.
441920	443920	How was your gaming week?
443920	448880	Um, it was pretty brief cause I don't have a lot of time and place of at home, but, um,
448880	451960	you know, I've been playing a lot of iPod games and stuff.
451960	453400	Uh, well, okay.
453400	456080	Really only one iPod game and playing plants versus zombies.
456080	458000	Uh, I can't help it.
458000	459000	It's so addicting.
459000	464200	Um, but yeah, it's, it's an awesome game, so you should get it really on any platform
464200	465840	that you can.
465840	471840	Um, then also of course more grand theft auto and that was pretty much it.
471840	473240	It's, I don't know.
473240	474240	It's fun.
474240	479720	We went back, like I said, to, uh, the Lost and Damned expansion and, um, I kinda, I kinda
479720	484000	missed the old, uh, open world actual death matches and stuff instead of being confined
484000	485960	to a really small portion of the map.
485960	489920	So it's kinda nice to do that and we're gonna be modding it again soon.
489920	493760	So we'll be back to the incredible games that we used to play.
493760	498960	Um, and then since she brought up something completely unrelated to the games, I thought
498960	503320	I'd bring something up that, you know, totally missed the boat on, like, years ago when it
503320	504320	came out.
504320	507320	But, um, this morning I actually watched that movie, uh, Shoot Em Up.
507320	509080	That movie is fucking crazy.
509080	511080	Oh, I don't know.
511080	516920	Um, I've never seen a person kill more people with a carrot than, you know, in that movie.
516920	521720	He, he murdered literally, like, 12 to 15 people with a carrot.
521720	523840	It didn't, like, break at any point?
523840	524840	No, different carrots.
524840	525840	Oh.
525840	527320	He, like, you know, shoved one through a guy's throat.
527320	529600	He stabbed a person in the eye with a carrot.
529600	534600	It was just, it was so, the movie, it, from the beginning, was just so over the top.
534600	536520	What the fuck movie is this?
536520	540840	It's with, um, oh, what the fuck is his name, uh.
540840	543720	That actor that nobody knows.
543720	544720	I don't know.
544720	545720	Yeah, I can't think of any.
545720	548240	That guy who did that thing in that place.
548240	549640	Yeah.
549640	553920	But no, it's a really, um, really just over the top movie.
553920	558240	If they spend, like, two minutes where it's just kinda, okay, normal, and then it's just,
558240	560120	like, boom, all action, just all the time.
560120	561120	Like, over the top.
561120	562120	Over the top action.
562120	563120	Just gratuitous.
563120	566080	They're having sex in a gunfight at the same time.
566080	572840	I mean, there's, oh, there, there's parts where he is, um, he was doing something with
572840	573840	a baby.
573840	574840	Oh.
574840	575840	Oh my.
575840	579880	Shoot Em Up is a 2007 action film starring Clive Owen, Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and
579880	580880	Monica Bellucci.
580880	582240	She was the hot chick in The Matrix, huh?
582240	584600	And she was the hot chick in that movie, too.
584600	590120	She was a, she was a lactating prostitute that he brought the baby to, to feed.
590120	591120	Wow.
591120	592560	Sounds like a real family fun film.
592560	594240	No, it's awesome, though.
594240	600200	Seriously, it is, like, such an awesome movie, and I do idolize the fact that he killed people
600200	601200	that annoyed him.
601200	604600	Like, he's all, you know, my pet pet, like, there's, like, one part, after a gunfight,
604600	608000	they're, like, getting away from these bad guys, and this guy cuts them off without,
608000	610680	you know, he's merged lanes without signaling.
610680	614960	So he chased the guy down, slammed him off the road, and then, you know, made him get
614960	615960	in a car accident.
615960	619880	There was some other guy that was slurping a, you know, milkshake, he shot the milkshake.
619880	624560	Another guy that had, like, really nasty-looking toenails, so he blew off his toes.
624560	626000	Of course, they were holding up.
626000	631200	I could have swore that Loki said, let's talk about actual video games this week.
631200	632200	Yeah, but then he said.
632200	633200	I did!
633200	634200	For, like, five seconds.
634200	635200	This is his Apple Hill moment.
635200	636200	Just give it to him, Rob.
636200	637200	Geez.
637200	640600	No, seriously, I mean, I totally missed this when it came out in theaters, but, you know,
640600	645840	it was, like, on DVD and Blu-ray and stuff like that, until it was on, you know, cable
645840	646840	TV.
646840	649640	No, seriously, it's such an awesome movie.
649640	650640	Just way over the top.
650640	654840	I don't understand why it didn't do better than it did in the box office, because it
654840	657840	was just such a crazy movie.
657840	663720	If I'm understanding this correctly, he's killing anyone that even slightly annoys him?
663720	669400	Like, there's no anger issues at all in this movie.
669400	676440	Not everybody, but, like, usually it's like, you know, just, I don't know, it's just lots
676440	681540	of funny one-liners in there, and just really ridiculous stuff, you know, at one point he
681540	685680	gets both of his thumbs broken, and he's, like, firing the gun in really weird ways.
685680	690220	He uses the carrot a lot, like, he uses the carrot to fire the gun, he jams a carrot into
690220	695920	the trigger of an Uzi and throws the Uzi, like, at the bad guys, and it's just, it's
695920	696920	so ridiculous.
696920	700920	Oh, there's one scene in the warehouse where he rigs this elaborate pulley system with
700920	704400	all these guns, and, like, they're coming after him, he's watching them on security
704400	709160	cameras and firing different guns in remote places, it's just ridiculous, but it would
709160	711120	make such an awesome video game.
711120	712120	Yeah, and this is called when?
712120	713760	And that's how we bring it back.
713760	715160	And this is called again?
715160	716160	Shoot Em Up.
716160	717160	Shoot Em Up.
717160	719160	That sounds like a lot of video games, actually.
719160	724040	No, seriously, I think it was, like, one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.
724040	728240	I mean, I think it even surpasses, like, Wanted for me, you know, because Wanted I thought
728240	731760	was a pretty awesome action movie, but this is just ridiculous.
731760	734200	This is, like, big hit ridiculous and then some.
734200	736040	I love the big hit.
736040	738040	Oh, that movie is ridiculous.
738040	739040	All right, wow.
739040	740920	Back to Shoot Em Up Radio.
740920	742720	I have a torrent ready.
742720	743720	Okay.
743720	747640	I mean, I have a YouTube clips of it ready.
747640	748760	Of course.
748760	749760	My Gaming Week.
749760	751920	Today, I actually played Plants vs. Zombies.
751920	752920	I'm not even kidding.
752920	754200	I played for, like, five minutes.
754200	756200	Oh, wow, is there an echo in the room?
756200	757200	Um, yeah.
757200	758200	Other games I played this week.
758200	761760	I played a little more of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light because I hadn't really
761760	765360	played it since the week it came out and I was like, oh, I want to beat more of it because
765360	766360	it's such a cool game.
766360	767360	So I want to play more of that.
767360	768360	So I did.
768360	769360	What?
769360	770360	What's that?
770360	771360	Sorry.
771360	772360	I remembered another game I played.
772360	773920	Is she just going to cut me off for your game?
773920	774920	I see how it is.
774920	775920	Sorry.
775920	776920	Well, you mentioned you made me think about it.
776920	777920	Fine.
777920	778920	What?
778920	779920	Droplets.
779920	780920	The hell's that?
780920	781920	It's a little puzzle game on Steam.
781920	782920	$2.
782920	784240	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
784240	785240	You know what?
785240	787480	I've got to go play that, too, because I got gifted a copy of that.
787480	788480	Yeah.
788480	789480	So I got to check that out.
789480	790480	I just didn't this week.
790480	791480	You should think about-
791480	792480	It's actually fun.
792480	793480	I'll check it out.
793480	795320	I've heard good things about it.
795320	799120	You should think about fitting Earthbound into there somewhere, Rob.
799120	800120	At some point.
800120	801120	Yes.
801120	802120	I know.
802120	803120	Yes.
803120	804120	You're a little behind, like, many years.
804120	805120	Stop.
805120	807600	And, let's see, I played World of Warcraft a lot because it's awesome.
807600	808600	Dork.
808600	809600	Shut up.
809600	810600	You played, too.
810600	811600	Shut up.
811600	812600	I played something new.
812600	816760	I played Need for Speed World, which is the free MMO, because it's free.
816760	817840	It's an MMO?
817840	820640	It's a free Need for Speed MMO.
820640	822400	It came up on the show a couple of weeks ago.
822400	823400	I have to know.
823400	824400	What do you do?
824400	825400	Do you just race against people?
825400	828960	To be honest, it really isn't much different from a Need for Speed game on, like, Xbox
828960	829960	360.
829960	831880	At least that's how it felt to me, is just that, you know, other people would show up
831880	832880	in races.
832880	834560	It was like, okay, you remember Test Drive on the 360?
834560	838120	I don't know if you ever played it, but you would just see other people as you're driving
838120	839900	by in the world.
839900	843480	Like you'd just kind of drive by them and there'd be, like, actual people on their 360s
843480	844960	out on the road that you'd be driving by.
844960	848580	Except none of them were me, because if they were me, I'd be driving off-road because that's
848580	849580	all I did with those cars.
849580	851640	Well, you sometimes see people doing that, too.
851640	855760	It's pretty much like that, but, like, it's kind of such a clusterfuck that, like, in
855760	860400	the first couple, like, I guess around a race or something, there's no collision detection
860400	864820	because, like, seriously, there'll be, like, 20 cars piled up where all the cars happen
864820	868780	to start, so it looks kind of funny with all these names.
868780	871320	So I didn't really get the MMO part of it, but...
871320	873000	And the cops are very dumb in that game.
873000	874560	Well, but as a free need...
874560	875920	They can't figure out how to get you off-road.
875920	877240	It's like, where'd he go?
877240	880520	Hold on, though, because I don't want to sound like I'm talking negative about the game,
880520	884800	because let's not neglect the fact it is a free need-for-speed game.
884800	889920	I didn't pay anything for it, and it's totally free, so hey, you know, it's really hard for
889920	894640	me to sit here and say, you know, talk bad about a free game, because it actually was
894640	895640	pretty decent.
895640	899520	And the only free games I can think of that I can talk bad about are Yaris, of course,
899520	900520	Totem Ball.
900520	901520	That was really bad.
901520	903420	I mean, there's only a handful, so...
903420	906720	But this is worth your time to look, especially if you're, like, a fan of racing games or
906720	908240	you like need-for-speed.
908240	912400	It plays a lot like one of the Xbox games that I've played in the past, so...
912400	913400	Oh.
913400	914400	Yeah, why not?
914400	915400	All right.
915400	916400	Check that out.
916400	917400	Cool.
917400	918400	Other than that, not a whole lot.
918400	921600	I was playing some new iPhone games, because who doesn't love iPhone games?
921600	922600	The Game Center games.
922600	927240	There's a game in there called Word Challenge, and I was a little scared at first because
927240	928840	it's by Zynga.
928840	930720	Because there's words in it, and I was really scared.
930720	931720	I know.
931720	933760	I was like, oh, but I'm illiterate.
933760	935560	But I actually thought it's...
935560	936640	It's basically Boggle.
936640	938080	You know the old game with Dias Boggle?
938080	939080	I do.
939080	941840	But it's free, and you can play online, and there's challenges, and it's...
941840	942840	Did I mention free?
942840	943840	The free part's good.
943840	947120	So is that why it's called Word Challenge?
947120	948120	Word Challenge?
948120	949120	Yes, because it involves words.
949120	950120	And it's challenging.
950120	951120	Okay.
951120	955720	It's challenging, because some of these words, I'm like, I never knew that was a word.
955720	956720	Like the?
956720	957720	Like what?
957720	958720	I don't know.
958720	959720	What does that mean?
959720	960720	You want to play around on here?
960720	961720	You made that word up.
961720	964680	Every obscure three-letter word.
964680	965680	You know.
965680	966680	That's like playing Scrabble Solitaire.
966680	967680	What does it all mean?
967680	968680	I guess.
968680	969680	I don't know.
969680	970680	I could go in and look up some obscure words.
970680	972320	They have that one game that's on the App Store now.
972320	976400	It's like some pirate version of Scrabble, where all the words are like R.
976400	981440	There's only so many words you can do in pirate-speak.
981440	984700	R, and then Rrrrrrrrrrr?
984700	986080	No, but that's literally what it was.
986080	987640	Yeah, it was literally that.
987640	990900	It was kind of a joke for Talk Like a Pirate Day or whatever.
990900	992340	Oh, I see.
992340	994360	Ooooh, why do you know that?
994360	997920	Let's see, I'm actually launching the game right now so I can read some of the obscure
997920	998920	words.
998920	1002860	I'm going into the challenges, because X-Link dared to send me some challenges.
1002860	1004460	And I whooped him.
1004460	1005460	But...
1005460	1014040	let's see what are some of the wagers eager look at some of the like like
1014040	1017240	these aren't words you think of like as you're playing these days let me look at
1017240	1023160	some of like okay you're eager that's not a word it is a word according it's
1023160	1032240	bad English it's like you're eager t-w-a-e-t way I've never I was what
1032240	1039460	wait w-a-e-t way like I did you say I see tire and I see twas and I get those like
1039460	1043540	twas the night before Christmas but way I've never heard of that and I almost
1043540	1051580	said twig but I know how to toy gives um what's a Vega V IGA Vega I don't know
1051580	1058860	that sounds dirty a Vega I think it's like it sounds like part of a word like
1058860	1063740	vegetable vagina okay the definition of Vega one of the heavy rafters and
1063740	1067060	especially a log supporting the roof of an American Indian or Spanish
1067060	1072220	architecture of the southwest cuz I fucking know Spanish architect Jesus
1072220	1078300	don't you feel sheepish now I do don't know that word all right you're more
1078300	1087260	eager and what is the Scottish variant of two oh so fucking Scottish words are
1087260	1092100	in the game I guess word would be banned and scrabble just saying alright so
1092100	1095660	anyway that's my playing that's my one problem with this game is that just like
1095660	1098620	totally you could just drag your finger around the board and connect three
1098620	1103660	letters as long as there's a value probably have a word so if you might be
1103660	1113060	able to make a word out of nothing but vowels actually alright how about the
1113060	1117820	our guests how was your gaming week the doctor well much like rice princess I
1117820	1122900	only own a Nintendo Wii so Nintendo of America I haven't playing video games at
1122900	1132300	all what do you been doing in real life did you Apple Hill I went I did and I
1132300	1137340	and I hate Captain Picard what it's first princess is showing me Captain
1137340	1143900	Picard Captain Picard and I went to Apple Hill apparently and we ate lots of
1143900	1147540	apples and had sex all right don't make things up all right you should make a
1147540	1155900	drink named after you know Star Trek and call it Bacardi salacious salacious pop
1155900	1161140	in our chat room says Aviga is a little vajay from Italy that hipsters right
1161140	1169620	around on all right rice princess I don't know if you have anything you want
1169620	1173060	to share about your gaming week but I thought I'd try anyway I played
1173060	1182460	homework for the PC did you and insomnia for the bed and that's about it that's
1182460	1188060	my gaming week in action you need to get a little like one of those like books to
1188060	1192420	read in bed I need to get one of those little books you know that's what
1192420	1197060	they're called right but well I think that any reader device or something like
1197060	1200580	an iPhone or a Kindle or something and then I'm like one of those things with
1200580	1206980	paper and words but then I'm like I'm like look at this game and see if books
1206980	1209740	is you didn't let me finish my thought but no I was like oh rice princesses
1209740	1213980	poor so I price just leave it for you fucker
1213980	1219060	rub it in my face loves you well you can just take junk mail staple it together
1219060	1226020	and pretend it's a book books I have to buy like $500 books for school I should
1226020	1232140	probably read them but no I won't book should be $500 I mean I realize that you
1232140	1236100	realize that yeah publishing companies are like well we can't make money on the
1236100	1240300	books we have to keep re-releasing the same crap in church $500 well and plus
1240300	1243420	they're not giving a discount on the iBooks and stuff now which I think is
1243420	1250340	ridiculous for schools well I prefer like paper books anyway so it seems to
1250340	1252860	me though that they should be given since they're not distributing the paper
1252860	1256380	they should give a discount some of the books end up being cheaper anyway though
1256380	1263380	I've gotten a few through Amazon that are just end up being something like
1263380	1267820	maybe $30 cheaper than my old textbook for the Kindle well I use the Kindle app
1267820	1274140	on my phone hmm so then like it's a lot better than bringing a whole big book
1274140	1280220	with me I actually bought a book in iBooks this week iPhone no it's like a
1280220	1285700	real is this the first time you bought a book in like 30 years probably no I buy
1285700	1290220	books here and there but Judy Bloom it was not a shitty balloon book screen it
1290220	1293940	was actually a political book which one I know weird I don't want to get into it
1293940	1300500	because okay politics is controversial like a Playboy app on there and the
1300500	1304340	problem is it's like everything in Playboy other than the nudity and it's
1304340	1308700	like no one wants to read that nobody it's like wait a minute post
1308700	1315580	advertisement man where are the titties but no it's just articles so that was my
1315580	1321780	gaming week awesome yeah sounds like fun it was all right now before we get into
1321780	1326220	some gaming news of yes we we do have some on the show housekeeping I'm not

1352020	1356300	can find us on Twitter lots of fun any housekeeping you want to add rice
1356300	1360940	princess no okay all right let's get into some gaming news Loki you want to
1360940	1365620	start us off tonight apparently I GM claims to have received technical specs
1365620	1373140	for the Nintendo DS 3ds Nintendo DS we know what's in it now years after it's
1373140	1379260	come out stickers and puppies in myspace.com ah let's see apparently the
1379260	1386700	handheld system will be using the DMP pick a 200 GPU wow that's impressive
1386700	1392100	except I don't know what it is um running as slowed down 166 megahertz
1392100	1398340	along with two arm 11 CPUs running at 266 megahertz and that's a lot of
1398340	1403740	megahertz right no of course not which of course it doesn't seem to back the
1403740	1409700	rumor that it was running the Nvidia Tegra chips and it says according to IGN
1409700	1415460	as well they will also have a looks like a gig and a half of flash memory for
1415460	1421460	storage much like the DS eyes do now except you know a little bit more
1421460	1425060	apparently numerous developers are working on software for the platform
1425060	1431060	obviously since they showed a bunch of stuff at e3 anyways and said that
1431060	1434420	they've likened the graphical capabilities to current generation
1434420	1439500	consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 albeit on smaller lower resolution
1439500	1447020	screens that's Connie and apparently I guess it's only gonna have 64 megs of
1447020	1452300	RAM which doesn't really compare you know favorably to like you know the
1452300	1457500	iPhones half a gig see that's what I don't understand is why they can't put
1457500	1461780	more RAM in these things I mean because RAM isn't that expensive and you know
1461780	1468660	kind of sucks when you don't have enough of it it's just my thought so yeah do
1468660	1474460	the cartridges not have it on there um no they don't but see that's the other
1474460	1477540	thing is so I don't understand why you couldn't do that say for example have
1477540	1485820	more RAM on the cartridge or something I don't know it's kind of dumb like even
1485820	1489220	when the Xbox 360 came out they have like what like 256 megs of RAM or
1489220	1494060	something in there I'm like you're releasing a system now that has like 256
1494060	1499420	megs of RAM when computers have well over that I mean we're not talking like
1499420	1503940	a computer from say the year 2000 or something I mean we're talking about an
1503940	1509180	Xbox 360 that's coming out years later and technology has just gotten way
1509180	1514780	better I mean you have a cutting-edge you know CPU GPU and you know all this
1514780	1518340	other stuff but oh we're only gonna stick like four megs of RAM in there you
1518340	1523700	know and we're gonna run DOS or something it's like don't skimp on
1523700	1529460	important stuff like that but I guess their reasoning behind is that first off
1529460	1536780	the 3ds doesn't have an iOS or some sort of operating system the hog resources
1536780	1543620	and also because it's low resolution it's not going to use as much RAM does
1543620	1548740	it explain how the 3d without glasses works though no 3d without glasses it's
1548740	1557340	basically like we talked about that like six months ago no it works very much
1557340	1563540	like those oh and I of course can't remember what they're called now you
1563540	1568740	have you seen those like for example kind of a hologram things that they have
1568740	1575780	lenticular it's like a lenticular page or something like that where basically
1575780	1579720	there's lenses in there that force half the image into one eye and half the
1579720	1583020	image into the other eye and it makes it seem like it's popping out or not
1583020	1587940	necessarily popping out but going back in it gives it depth so that's how it
1587940	1593820	works oh there's actually a person standing behind the DS and like holding
1593820	1600340	stuff in front of your face tiny tiny digital midget is how it's done mm-hmm
1600340	1607660	so there will be plenty of sex games on the 3ds then what I would assume so yes
1607660	1616660	it's powered by the force all right I don't know what powers this game but
1616660	1620940	there's gonna be a apparently a reboot rumored of Tomb Raider this you know
1620940	1624500	this has been rumored for some time and it's kind of a duh because you know
1624500	1628260	Tomb Raider it's been making those games for times now I don't know seriously
1628260	1633220	well the last one a reboot and then the last one before that a reboot I guess I
1633220	1636620	don't know but well and then this Laura Croft game was also kind of a reboot but
1636620	1640300	it was more like let's go this way with it let's make kind of a different game
1640300	1643780	with the same character it's it's it's kind of different yes it's worked well
1643780	1648900	all those times well actually some of them weren't bad and this most recent
1648900	1651620	one the Laura Croft game is the most interesting one I think I've played
1651620	1656220	since the first two on the PC years ago but they got it right then they wouldn't
1656220	1659460	be rebooting it every few years well I think there's supposed to be different
1659460	1663020	different franchises like I think there's gonna be new Laura Croft games
1663020	1667820	for the arcade download and then the DVD blu-ray games will be these this this
1667820	1672380	reboot or whatever that's been rumored for some time and in an interview with
1672380	1676940	I'm sorry not an interview but a report from Eurogamer apparently says that the
1676940	1681620	latest issue a PC gamer I guess I get their eyes on it first says that the new
1681620	1685900	Tomb Raider is indeed happening it's supposed to be set on a Japanese island
1685900	1690820	and it will offer Laura in an open world it's a quote cohesive level with
1690820	1695740	multiple ways around the puzzles so it's one giant level I guess is how this game
1695740	1699820	is supposed to work Croft 64 something like that they're gonna say that Laura
1699820	1705060	is quote younger and inexperienced in the ways of raiding tombs I love that
1705060	1709940	quote she's inexperienced in raiding tombs she just needs a strong man to
1709940	1717220	share the way they're guessing holiday 2011 for Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 and PC
1717220	1721500	notice how I left out the Wii as long as you can lock everybody in the freezer
1721500	1727940	I'll be happy she looks so mad in that picture but a little picture yeah I you
1727940	1732900	know obviously I really like the game that was on Xbox so it's kind of the
1732900	1736860	download that's coming out on the other platforms really soon so if that's kind
1736860	1740460	of the direction they're going with it I'm I'm all for it although it's not
1740460	1743220	supposed to be that they've said it's gonna be a completely different kind of
1743220	1747900	game I guess more like the original but I don't know like the latest game on the
1747900	1753060	arcade kind of has me excited about Lara Croft again so this could be good I
1753060	1756500	liked back when the early rumors were suggesting it was more of a survival
1756500	1759900	horror game like if that's true and I think that's awesome that doesn't even
1759900	1765420	make sense though how is there a segue between Tomb Raider and then oh did you
1765420	1768900	ever see the descent the movie the descent did see the where it's all the
1768900	1771700	chicks in the cave and it's like one of the scariest movies I've ever seen
1771700	1796220	oh come on I don't think I've ever seen a scarier movie than the descent but it
1796220	1805020	wasn't that the whole time like I've seen much scarier movies than that like
1805020	1816300	the Care Bears movie shit was scary man Pokemon three assholes like you know
1816300	1822860	caverns or something like that fraggle rock the movie give you nightmares it
1822860	1826740	didn't really give me nightmares it actually like I bet I'm so I'm kind of
1826740	1830180	sick like it actually made me want to go like explore a cave just so I could get
1830180	1835900	scared more I want well hold on and now you know though what every gay guy in
1835900	1841620	Ammon our County does rob rice princess I wanted to go spelunking were you gonna
1841620	1847700	go I asked spelunking you'll laugh if I tell you the only movie that gave me
1847700	1852300	nightmares huh poltergeist 3 some of the poltergeist movies were kind of scary it
1852300	1857660	was the mirrors freaked out over mirrors for like a week I'm not even kidding
1857660	1861140	about the Care Bears movie like there's this one part where they go into the fun
1861140	1865660	house and it's like the guy's chasing him and he looks like you know crazy and
1865660	1869460	I'm just like ah I love it oh no we watched labyrinth last night and I always
1869460	1872860	get freaked out with the creatures that take their heads off I know they're no
1872860	1875480	that when I was a little kid I would fast forward through that scene like no

1881100	1886940	this is have to do a Tomb Raider scary forest and then rice princess and I

2082360	2087100	games good for social gaming ooh
2087100	2094620	basically Tom Kozak who is the executive VP of online and mobile gaming said that
2094620	2103100	they're gonna use Atari's catalog and independent developers to I guess provide
2103100	2108060	more casual and online social gaming basically it's here's our old shit you
2108060	2113900	don't have an Atari play this and I could go no sir you're wrong I have
2113900	2118540	several I don't need your online blaming we've played their games on like every
2118540	2123740	system that's been released ever yay I can play Missile Command again and then
2123740	2127660	like I could put mr. awesome on my friends list on Facebook and then just
2127660	2131140	you know get all these little like pokes and graphics about how much better he is
2131140	2135180	at Missile Command to me why can't we just like have Atari go sit in their
2135180	2141620	corner and stop putting out their old shit how about Atari no well they're
2141620	2145460	also though are doing more things for the core games as well like they have a
2145460	2151300	Facebook tie-in that's going to unlock extra con or might unlock extra content
2151300	2156180	for test drive unlimited 2 and then asteroids online and deer hunter deer
2156180	2161420	hunter online are they're gonna be reimaginings of those in a socialized
2161420	2169700	context and I quoted that how does one socialize and asteroids hey rock dude I
2169700	2174420	shot your rock oh yeah well my rocks now three that's what's gonna be on Facebook

2178460	2191940	here to shoot her back this is all free though right I hope if it's Facebook it's
2191940	2197060	got to be right I don't know they use they use the word that I hate oh my
2197060	2204220	microtransactions fun so yeah I will make the most microtransactions
2204220	2208540	transaction is a trend zero trends but I've been on that site recently I think
2208540	2211580	after this whole thing launched and like I was able to play Missile Command for
2211580	2216260	free that some of the newer ones were gonna have the whole microtransaction I
2216260	2220820	literally played one level and I was like Oh Missile Command back to porn I
2220820	2227180	wonder if those different kind of Missile Command that's basically everyone's night
2227180	2234380	on the internet every day Rob oh look something cool porn well wait a second
2234380	2240660	why don't they do that I mean if you think about it it makes perfect sense to
2240660	2245980	me everybody is looking for casual gaming and porn so why not make like a
2245980	2251300	Facebook that's like you know full of porn and like you asked book and just
2251300	2255260	have like you know tons of casual games you know they could be like Missile
2255260	2259340	Command and stuff but they're no they have porn in the background or you know
2259340	2264020	it's you're playing against porn stars or they're porno things where you have
2264020	2268580	like a big dildo shooting floating vaginas or something yeah sure whatever
2268580	2275940	yeah yeah sure whatever you know support any kind of work come on coming soon to
2275940	2284480	the PC it's the Atari go I don't like it stop it right hey remember that one we
2284480	2288140	bought years and years ago for Rob and it was like summer boys something like
2288140	2293100	that in the back said like watch these boys beat the heat and their meat in
2293100	2298460	this crazy sex drive bringing this up on our video game talk show that's the best
2298460	2304860	line I've ever seen on the back of a DVD ever it's why we bought it for you Rob
2304860	2317180	Wow cuz you like to watch gay porn but Rob so does Jamie but Rob has the
2317180	2324700	ability to sleep through very noisy gay porn Wow at Disneyland oh yeah I
2324700	2329180	remember the clincher right there at Disneyland we were we all we all went to
2329180	2335660	Disneyland on the trip with with the giggling lesbians of orange on radio
2336380	2341980	story the giggling lesbians of orange it was Kristen and Meg's ego to play Atari
2341980	2350140	game and then we're all like awake and Rob's like all the girls we had a suite
2350140	2353980	and it was like the living room with a fold with the height of bed and then
2353980	2357180	there was a closed-off room with two double beds in it and so Kristin Meg's
2357180	2364420	he had one and I ignored their slurp you know he says oh my and I was and I was I
2364420	2367900	was you know so we all wore awake before Rob and Rob's just like dead to the
2367900	2375140	world and very interesting like with this pillow half over said it was funny
2375140	2379420	hold on watch if you listen carefully can you hear it yeah you hear all that
2379420	2384660	clicking yeah that's all the people unsubscribing from all our right now so
2384660	2392260	so Kristen takes out her laptop this is I brought gay porn and so it's really
2392260	2401900	loud and she turns up her computer all the way and Rob's just like we let it
2401900	2406180	play through like the biggest you know this aquatic scene that would make show
2406180	2415020	girls I don't really be shamed I have one more idea for a game this is
2415020	2419780	actually not it's not too bad I mean it's all right you know know how they
2419780	2424980	have that kind of hobby that's geocaching or you know I guess GPS
2424980	2430260	hunting that type of stuff you call it fine porn or found porn and basically
2430260	2434620	hide porn around there and mark it on your GPS you know location people can go
2434620	2439580	find the porn or there could be a naked slut yeah that's way too much work I'm
2439580	2444140	gonna do that on my computer oh I found porn and I'm gonna watch it that's
2444140	2448340	that's the new Google Earth a little click you can do like just randomly you
2448340	2452260	have to search the Google Earth for like random porn place and rent please one
2452260	2455300	time at work I was trying to type in Google and I typed in goggle and it
2455300	2462580	brought up porn years ago it was a typo good job that's like when you tell
2462580	2465540	people at work like oh yeah if you want to see the latest so what's going on you
2465540	2470020	you go to whitehouse.com with the president because whitehouse.com I don't
2470020	2474260	know if it still is we used to be a porno site hmm cuz whitehouse.gov is the
2474260	2482420	correct oh clever how about video game news did you know we do that you're on
2482420	2485460	orange on radio once in a while why would we do that I don't know
2485460	2490900	Loki do you have some are you busy looking for making sure it up it's not a
2490900	2496420	real website anymore it used to be used to be yeah anyways big brother was
2496420	2502900	watching they were and they were amused so super street fighter 4 is not coming
2502900	2507620	out on PC I know people are probably surprised considering it's been months
2507620	2513060	since it's been released but uh it's not coming on PC because apparently games
2513060	2520740	are pirated and stuff on the PC so yeah they didn't want to release it on PC I
2520740	2527940	guess what does that mean I think that their first Street Fighter 4 game got
2527940	2533740	pirated a lot now I think apparently they said in a recent interview with
2533740	2542580	fourgamer.net that Yoshin Nori Oh No confirmed that while the PC version of
2542580	2547900	Street Fighter 4 was a big seller worldwide wait a second that sold a lot
2547900	2553740	and wasn't really pirated that much then okay whatever the publisher has no plans
2553740	2558500	to put the new and improved super Street Street Fighter 4 iteration on home
2558500	2563100	computers new platforms high rate of piracy they said that the port is still
2563100	2570060	possible if Capcom can find reasonable DRM solution for the title you honestly
2570060	2575380	just forget it I mean cuz you're gonna waste all this damn time spend all this
2575380	2583140	money on DRM solution and be cracked in a day I mean just put it out really it's
2583140	2588140	you're not gonna get pirated any less than if you have DRM on it then not
2588140	2591820	having DRM on it do you think there's gonna come a time when the companies
2591820	2595580	just start saying you know what too bad so sad for the people that can't handle
2595580	2598980	this but the DRM now is that you must connect to the internet and you have to
2598980	2601980	put in a unique serial number just like you do for a lot of MMOs like World of
2601980	2606020	Warcraft and stuff do you think the day is coming where you know what that too
2606020	2609780	bad so sad if that DRM doesn't work for you but piracy has gotten so bad that we
2609780	2613620	have no other choice cuz I keep thinking in my mind I kind of I'm surprised the
2613620	2617460	companies haven't got to this point you know as much as I don't like it as a
2617460	2621900	consumer it would surprise me at all if they started going there it's possible
2621900	2625860	that they do that but even sometimes there's ways around that around getting
2625860	2630620	the phone home and types you know that kind of thing you could for example have
2630620	2634980	a program running in the background that mimics their authentication server and
2634980	2639580	you just change the forwards on like a certain IP address on your computer so
2639580	2644780	that it forwards to that they've done that for a few things you know like some
2644780	2648540	of the Adobe programs and stuff like that you phone home and you can disable
2648540	2655340	that I would know so I mean don't get me wrong I don't I don't want folks to hear
2655340	2658380	me the wrong way I'm not like saying like I support this DRM to start
2658380	2662220	happening but I wouldn't be surprised if companies kind of felt like there was no
2662220	2665380	other choice and by this way of like big companies like Microsoft and stuff that
2665380	2670100	put out these operating systems and they supposedly have these ways that you know
2670100	2675660	the system you know calls home that you know authenticate Windows and that kind
2675660	2679540	of thing and yet there's still pirated versions out there despite the fact
2679540	2685740	there oh Windows 7 no we're gonna have stronger security and part it it's like
2685740	2691380	okay so that took three seconds instead of two seconds okay well in the
2691380	2697940	interest of the companies I mean DRM is not always gonna work I mean it some
2697940	2701020	people may not want to spend the effort to try to get past it usually it just
2701020	2704780	ends up hurting the people that bought the game legitimately and all it really
2704780	2710900	does is delay when people pirate the game so that does drive some sales for
2710900	2714740	people but they have to also realize a lot of people that we're gonna you know
2714740	2719980	pirate the game probably we're gonna buy it originally so you technically not
2719980	2723380	losing sales because if they can't pirate the game they're just not gonna
2723380	2726260	download it and they're not gonna play it they're not gonna you know unless
2726260	2733140	it's a really really good game they're not gonna go out and buy it all right
2733140	2736780	hmm you guys remember the old like pathetic ways that they used to like try
2736780	2740500	to stop pirating like we're gonna put a crazy word in the instruction booklet
2740500	2743980	that you have to know like to get past the thing it's like yeah well then you
2743980	2748220	just told all your friends what's the second word on page four of the manual
2748220	2751260	yeah I'm yeah and what's the crazy you know third day of the week the way we
2751260	2753100	said you know it was like and then you just tell all your friends and it
2753100	2757620	doesn't matter the wheels I don't know the wheels yeah they for the Lucasarts
2757620	2761060	games they had wheels that you had to rotate around at different things and
2761060	2766860	then you'd have to read a code number out of one of the slots or something
2766860	2772380	what wah wah and those even didn't work either because you could either
2772380	2776540	photocopy the manual or you can rip apart that disk and photocopy the disk
2776540	2782380	so once again it doesn't matter what DRM solutions they put out there even if
2782380	2786860	it's a USB dongle or something like that some really expensive programs like
2786860	2790900	graphic programs so like that that are you know thousands of dollars will
2790900	2793860	actually have a physical device that needs to be plugged into the computer to
2793860	2797340	work those still can be pirated though because people find ways to mimic
2797340	2801860	whatever that device is and there's no way around everything everybody's gonna
2801860	2805220	find a way around something given them out you know a significant amount of
2805220	2808900	time there will always be a way around something because if you can make it
2808900	2813860	someone else can make it again all right well speaking of a game that was
2813860	2818740	somewhat hurt by piracy allegedly halo reach I came out of course a couple
2818740	2823380	weeks ago and if you already have beat the game and you're already bored of it
2823380	2827140	maybe there should be a mini game that you should go play that is actually
2827140	2832380	hidden in halo reach it's called reach racer and it's a warthog racing game
2832380	2837020	that is inside reach what happens is that if two people get to a spot in the
2837020	2844660	oni sword base you can actually play this little mini game reach racer oh you
2844660	2848860	all right over there you made me drop my mic sorry about that trauma I hey I
2848860	2851500	think I think that's kind of cool I like when there's fun little things like that
2851500	2858380	in a game so I just know all morning I was hearing boom yay boom yay boom yay
2858380	2864340	all morning why was Dan playing halo reach yes is that what he actually says
2864340	2868740	yeah no it has a little party mode thing in there where you get a headshot kids
2868740	2878220	go and then they put on the duck boots from Castlevania go right sorry bones
2878220	2881820	double o6 and share bonds double o6 and chat says okay that almost made me want
2881820	2886740	to get reach that's kind of cool well the the forge editor and the reach
2886740	2892540	anyways it's just really incredible anyways so maybe that's your thing going
2892540	2895500	back up a little bit in chat Robert M is talking about the copy protection thing
2895500	2899420	it says the pages with red paper to keep it from being copied I remember those
2899420	2904540	two there were manuals that would have like the red paper so ridiculous but it
2904540	2908340	kind of worked for a little bit like until the internet came out where it's
2908340	2921260	color scanners and they're like foil again color copies not available to copy
2921260	2927300	these CDs alright release dates coming up in a minute but first dark Sakura
2927300	2934180	well there has been something that has been spotted a new Wii controller
2934180	2942140	oh it's actually the Wii remote plus that seems to be a combination of the
2942140	2948820	Wii motion plus and the Wii remote and it's gonna be coming with a game called
2948820	2959380	fling smash that well it looks like tennis but with a crazy-ass ball so you
2959380	2965660	have to use this ball guy named zip and you use your controller I guess to smack
2965660	2970620	them around the different places I'd I'd have to see more than just this this
2970620	2978820	picture and now there is no date out for the UK the game is listed but not the
2978820	2985420	special controller so I don't know when they're gonna get it overseas I can't
2985420	2989620	help but feel this is like kind of like a Wii play type thing it is throw in a
2989620	2993260	controller with a subpar game there was there is no interest in this game
2993260	2996380	whatsoever not that I'm judging this game without playing it but I'm just
2996380	3000900	gonna take a wild guess and guess didn't say it's not very good it will be the
3000900	3004220	best game of the there'll be the best-selling game of the year because it
3004220	3007820	comes with a stupid remote well if you think about the games 50 bucks and you
3007820	3011820	get a remote that's probably worth at least 50 bucks because I'm sure it's
3011820	3015540	gonna be more than just the normal remote and people should get pissed off
3015540	3018580	because now they bought a remote and super emotional plus and now they come
3018580	3024060	out with something that's all-in-one despite the fact that perhaps they
3024060	3028060	should have I don't know put it all in one to begin with so that they could do
3028060	3032900	all the stuff that they said they were gonna be able to do it prints money
3032900	3039460	dark use K and chat says whatever we is dead you guys agree no what what do you
3039460	3048540	think rice princess we have a week now I use it for Netflix it's
3048700	3053660	poop it's doing all right it's just there's I mean the games coming out that
3053660	3060660	were our big releases for Nintendo I just don't really care too much about
3060660	3065300	like ooh it's Donkey Kong Country again wow that's awesome I remember playing
3065300	3068860	that back on super Nintendo let's not forget how amazed and in all we all were
3068860	3074300	after e3 at you know their lineup and yes I was impressed with Metroid other
3074300	3079220	M and then it sucked wow that's awesome thank you I'm glad that team ninja
3079220	3086420	really pulled it off oh but it sucked and then you know new Zelda game whoop
3086420	3090900	these shit it's just a brighter more colorful cheerful Twilight Princess with
3090900	3100140	new gadgets and shit I mean I don't know it's it was it was sounds like fun it
3100140	3106140	was it was a difference between like you know what it looks like on paper what it
3106140	3114540	actually comes out to be and I don't know the 3ds 3ds will be kind of cool
3114540	3118140	you'll have to check out what the games look like and stuff like that but as far
3118140	3121260	as like the console releases for this year from Nintendo I could care less
3121260	3125940	yeah Kirby's epic yarn I guess looks all right it's kind of a neat design for the
3125940	3131300	game but you know like Donkey Kong I could care less or couldn't care less I
3131300	3137780	guess because care less that makes no sense and then fling smash well no one
3137780	3141820	cares about fling smash except now that has a you know stupid controller thing
3141820	3147700	in it all right well let's travel around the world and look at some release dates
3147700	3152300	of things that are coming out to a store near you real soon this week actually
3152300	3157420	some pretty cool stuff coming out of course dead rising 2 will be out on
3157420	3163660	PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC this week so that's pretty sweet
3163660	3168020	guitar hero warriors of rock you know it's kind of funny is a lot of the music
3168020	3173860	games coming out nowadays people don't care so but guitar hero where he's a
3173860	3180420	rock is coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and we never forget they're all $60
3180420	3185740	because Activision is fucking lame and so they decided to charge $60 for all
3185740	3191860	three games because I don't know you're suckers and you'll buy it so wonderful
3191860	3195260	let them get away with that and then they're gonna be charging $60 for all
3195260	3198180	their Wii games oh but it doesn't matter because people don't buy games in the
3198180	3204180	week also of course guitar hero warriors of rock will be coming out in different
3204180	3207660	bundles they have one with like the full band set up which is really just the
3207660	3210700	instruments from last year so don't expect the new guitar in that you can
3210700	3214220	only get that in the guitar kit and they aren't selling the guitar separately so
3214220	3218100	if you want the lame new guitar that's out there you're gonna buy in that
3218100	3222860	stupid bundle other fun stuff coming up this week a re-release of the sims 3

3634900	3638100	they're saying the sly collections coming on PlayStation 3 I think it's
3638100	3643740	later in the later in the year and then finally this is high-quality Wii games
3643740	3647020	for you this is one of those first party games for Nintendo that's really gonna
3647020	3653720	innovate and change the whole landscape of the Wii we party coming to us on the
3653720	3657540	Wii that's also from Hudson that made the Mario Party games I played it at e3
3657540	3662580	it was cute but it's another party game cute that's just like with them
3662580	3667460	complaining on why the GameCube people only buy it for kids stuff it's only got
3667460	3672180	kids game why can't we get people to actually you know develop mature games
3672180	3679140	on our system I don't know why you know I have a question for anyone no okay
3679140	3684340	when you've heard of this game that's gonna come out and it's really hyped and
3684340	3686820	it sounds really good and you really want to play it and then you actually
3686820	3693180	get it lately has it lived up to the hype for you you mean like Final Fantasy
3693180	3699300	14 when I played the beta yeah I wanted to cry it was so tears of joy no tears
3699300	3702420	of pain yeah don't worry they're limiting the amount of suffering you
3702420	3706380	actually have to endure because you can't play long hours on this game
3706380	3710900	because they will start dropping your XP really yeah I haven't played the full
3710900	3715260	game yet and like here's here's the sick thing y'all I'm really sick oh you're
3715260	3720260	sick here's the thing um even though like I really hated the beta I still
3720260	3725540	feel like I need to buy the retail game because I spent so much time on 11 and
3725540	3735460	it's a Final Fantasy games oh that's exactly yes I know the industry you do
3735460	3740660	have a problem it's called wasting your money on shit don't do it how about you
3740660	3744140	just wait for the reviews to come out yeah I'm gonna try and see if some of
3744140	3749620	the reviews what they say but I mean like okay remember back in the day like
3749620	3753460	say with Symphony of the Night or like Metal Gear Solid or something there was
3753460	3757620	this big hype about it and you play it and it's a great game it's innovative
3757620	3761300	it's just wonderful nowadays it doesn't seem like there are games like that
3761300	3767980	anymore what do you think Rob um I don't know I thought Final Fantasy 13 was
3767980	3771380	pretty awesome and it had a lot of hype behind it I mean not 14 but 13 was
3771380	3776580	pretty good I don't know sometimes the hype machine can kind of ruin games like
3776580	3779580	I think part of the reason I didn't want to buy Halo Reach is that like you just
3779580	3783300	can't get away from it and I'm just like like I was playing Lara Croft online and
3783300	3786180	I actually got an Xbox Live message somebody that was like well you're not
3786180	3790860	playing Halo Reach and I'm just like screw you I'll play what I want I'm like
3790860	3796020	I'm gonna put in freaking cameo or one of like the Xbox 360 launch games just
3796020	3800020	to irritate you but then I realized I'd actually have to play cameo and that I
3800020	3806260	don't know I someone saw someone this week playing on my friends list and you
3806260	3811020	know who you are I think cuz I don't remember who you are someone's actually
3811020	3822020	playing lost via domus the lost console wow it was terrible absolutely terrible
3822020	3827060	like the show lost the show law I was at the one where Michael's like man I don't
3827060	3830860	have time for that world and all he was doing was yelling well the whole time
3830860	3836700	like I remember that game it was awful all right let's go to Japanese release
3836700	3841380	dates of Loki's known with the US coming out in Japan this week we have monster
3841380	3846300	hunter frontier online season 9.0 on the Xbox 360 from Capcom is the monster
3846300	3849500	hunter series is pretty epic over there although they don't really do anything
3849500	3854300	with it here on the 360 interesting dead rising 2 gets its Japanese release this
3854300	3858660	this week as well to kind of coincide with the stateside one over here Madden
3858660	3862100	NFL 11 gets its release in Japan it's been out here for a little bit but it
3862100	3865340	gets localized for Japan so it actually even though it's still all the same
3865340	3869500	American football teams it's all in Japanese a game called quantum theory
3869500	3873260	comes out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan there's a regular and limited
3873260	3878420	edition it's kind of a looks like kind of like a bayonetta II type of game I

3882580	3886620	and limbs falling off and all that fun stuff that's from Tecmo I wonder if it's
3886620	3891860	a team ninja game I don't think it is though going over to the PlayStation 3
3891860	3895820	probably quite a few of those same games coming out of there yep dead rising 2
3895820	3899620	comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3 and quantum theory and
3899620	3903180	Madden NFL so all those same games coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well

4147740	4155340	that's it for this week on the end of that
4155340	4166180	fiend so something that hopefully you didn't purchase a PB well of course as
4166180	4171180	we mentioned last week a PB is no more it has been canceled after just three
4171180	4177200	months and well fans aren't exactly happy about that they are a little
4177200	4181100	upset because they invested you know 50 bucks on the game that they can no
4181100	4188240	longer play well apparently I guess people have been trying to get refunds
4188240	4194780	via steam and haven't really met you know with any success on that but EA
4194780	4199640	apparently is gonna try to help people out it says the user has been posting
4199640	4204680	about their experience talking to EA support regarding this issue several
4204680	4210300	users have been able to receive a $20 discount code for their inconvenience
4210300	4215140	while others have I guess managed to convince support representatives to give
4215140	4220940	them a game of equivalent value the I guess the person that posted the threat
4220940	4224840	originally included a chat log that shows that they were able to get a copy
4224840	4233940	of Dragon Age 2 upon the tiles release so I guess if you bought a PB you may
4233940	4239780	want to go chat with EA support which is of course support.ea.com and see if they
4239780	4243260	can help you out and get you some of your money back that you spent on it
4243260	4252860	you're gross Rob sorry sorry totally listening to Loki right now I promise
4252860	4258500	mm-hmm yes well I'm not talking anymore so that's not really helpful we're still
4258500	4263700	listening to you okay I was offering rice princess and black licorice and she
4263700	4268540	was like oh no get that out of my face looks like dog crap I don't want your
4268540	4273220	licorice it's really good you want some dark soccer I can't have licorice
4273220	4278940	and Dan insists on eating it around me in his car and I'm like gag it's really
4278940	4282380	good so what I had to do since rice princess loves it so much I waved the
4282380	4285500	bag in front of her face so she could get the smell and then she's like sure I
4285500	4289940	want one and that means she just wants to take one to throw it at me so I let
4289940	4296540	her put her hand in the bag to grab when she's all like you put them up your butt
4296540	4303080	before you put them in the bag knock it off all right oh yeah bummer about APB
4303080	4308380	and all that but I feel bad for those customer service reps that I have to
4308380	4311020	deal with all the angst because you know it's gonna open the floodgate once you
4311020	4315180	hear the one person got something free now you know no thanks in part to this
4315180	4319420	show there's gonna be tons of people that go on there and they're like I want
4319420	4324780	my free stuff I bought APB where's my free stuff just like that I found a
4324780	4330380	Christmas card that was hello random no I school it was sent to me by one of our
4330380	4336140	listeners by by Rob overseas mm-hmm and it says fuck office parties fuck jingle
4336140	4340340	bells fuck mince pies fuck Rudolph like Santa fuck Christmas how appropriate
4340340	4345820	since you're Jewish now yes I'm gonna put it up on my desk right now good idea
4345820	4351140	all right hey let's say 100 Matt wants to know us so what's the difference is
4351140	4357040	the black licorice bigger and longer just tastier actually yeah if you like
4357040	4364820	the taste of shit like which is amazing all right bro you're gross your face is
4364820	4368920	gross hey this game is awesome though it's not gross at all you don't know
4368920	4373420	Jack remember this game this is like the best video game ever I loved this game
4373420	4377260	it's hardly a video game but yeah that's like a game show you type of game well
4377260	4383820	anyway it's been rated by the ESRB for the 360 the Wii and the PlayStation 3
4383820	4387780	and you know what that means it's coming out soon because the ESRB always ruins
4387780	4393140	and spoils releases so it looks like it is really happening THQ is revamping it
4393140	4399540	all we know is that the game got rated on crude humor quote the ending credits
4399540	4404620	contain audio commercials of fictitious TV reality programs for example farting
4404620	4410380	with the stars which is accompanied by lard loud flatulent sound effects yay
4410380	4416740	more dick and fart jokes my favorite yay I never talk about those not at all so
4416740	4425340	I'm your card you should put a picture up of rice princess holding black
4425340	4431220	licorice I'm never touching it ever again shut up all right I think this
4431220	4435980	means now that our show is starting to completely derail it's time to bring it
4435980	4441800	back to some classics for the segment we call here on orange lounge radio the
4441800	4445500	classic game of the week it's a chance for dark soccer to dive into the video
4445500	4450780	game vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids and your spinach
4450780	4455620	trucks stop chasing the spinach truck and play this video game for a little
4455620	4461820	bit dark soccer what's the classic game of the week elevator action whoa
4461820	4469540	Ella later go down good end a whole elevator action is first of all this is
4469540	4486540	Dan suggestion okay elevator action came out in 1983 by Taito you know what else
4486540	4495380	Taito gave us bubble bobble and puzzle bobble yay I love Taito games and it
4495380	4502940	actually had a sequel elevator action 2 also called elevator action returns the
4502940	4510580	game is great it's the music was done by Yoshino Imamura so let's go on with how
4510580	4515700	the game is played you play a spy and you go down an elevator you actually
4515700	4521100	are in a building that has lots of elevators and you have to can get secret
4521100	4525860	documents and go through 30 levels and then do all these puzzles involving
4525860	4530300	different elevators and you've got enemy agents they're trying to shoot you no
4530300	4537740	face so you either have to shoot them back or run away or hide and you get all
4537740	4544260	your documents and you go from the top of the building to the bottom and the
4544260	4548740	lower that you get you actually have to solve more puzzles to get around it the
4548740	4553620	control was a four-way joystick two buttons one for shooting the other for
4553620	4558300	jumping and kicking because I always jump and kick at the same time so very
4558300	4562940	very simple easy game two players you'd alternate times you play as agent 17
4562940	4573020	codenamed Otto so you don't have a timer but you do have a time limit it goes
4573020	4578820	into a hurry-up mode so the music will change and tell you to hurry up pretty
4578820	4585980	much yeah um you see you have different you get a different score for
4585980	4590900	retrieving documents knocking on agent by dropping a light on them crush an
4590900	4595620	agent using the elevator gory yeah you can get crushed to the elevator too if
4595620	4600200	you're not careful knock out an agent by jumping or kicking eliminate an agent by
4600200	4604820	gun and you get bonus points completing each round and you also get an extra
4604820	4612940	life we hit 10,000 points as far as versions of it there is actually a
4612940	4620900	parody called Ella paper action which is a that sounds stupid yeah um they had a
4620900	4626660	two of them on palm OS agency and agency two it's based on elevator action
4626660	4630540	there's Dexter's laboratory robot rampage that's based on elevator action
4630540	4637280	to 505 games put a similar game out on the week called spy games elevator
4637280	4642180	mission it's called elevator combat in Europe there's a port on Gameboy there's
4642180	4648420	any s version that made it on to the virtual console in 2007 and an elevator
4648420	4652280	action death parade is a light gun shooter that uses elevator doors when
4652280	4662300	changing scenes so there you go as far as earlier ports there was the ZX
4662300	4668600	spectrum and shred CPC MSX Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System and Game
4668600	4674060	Boy there was one plan for the Atari 2600 but there is it never was released
4674060	4680240	however the prototype exists and was sold at classic gaming Expo 2001 it was
4680240	4685400	only 95% complete though and then Sony had a mobile version of it as far as
4685400	4689100	compilations we have elevator action EX for Game Boy Color elevator action old
4689100	4692780	new Game Boy Advance elevator action returns on Sega Saturn which I think I
4692780	4700300	have title legends set in the title legends power up and yeah that's it so
4700300	4703760	can I be honest about something what I think this game sucks like it's one of
4703760	4708340	those things I remember much more fondly as a child but I actually bought that
4708340	4713060	title collection when it was out on the regular Xbox and kind of revisited this
4713060	4716260	game and I was like this game is horrible like I think part of that's
4716260	4719580	just cuz it's really hard and always get crushed by elevators I've seen Dan play
4719580	4723740	through this game just like all the time really and when I said hey Dan help me
4723740	4729380	think of a classic game he's like elevator action okay no I mean it is a
4729380	4732460	classic in some regards I just I didn't I thought it was one of those games
4732460	4735580	always kind of looked better than it played now you know what came in in this
4735580	4744700	vein that I actually like a whole lot better hmm mappy maybe mappy will be on
4744700	4749380	the list one day all right well there it is good old good Namco goodness like it
4749380	4753500	or not your classic game of the week elevator action elevator action there
4753500	4757100	it is that's a pretty cool YouTube to the guy beating the level because it
4757100	4760980	makes it look so easy it's really not this game is hard if you ever play this
4760980	4766740	game rice princess no it's hard looks like it it is okay all right well that's
4766740	4770020	gonna do it for this first half year of orange lounge radio but don't go

4818040	4822580	New Year's yeah crazy huh no wait a little further than that like January
4822580	4828660	February maybe just in time for Valentine's Day whoa all right joining
4828660	4832060	us tonight as you can hear a rice princess and the doctor and we were
4832060	4835260	talking a little bit about the break music which I know you podcaster folks
4835260	4839460	can't hear it sadly it's copyright stuff I'm sorry you can't play it but we can
4839460	4843600	do it live and we played a variety of songs during that break and the last one
4843600	4847180	we played was from Secret of Mana the flight into the unknown and that made
4847180	4850460	Jamie go let's have a secret of mana party and I'm like wow yes that's a
4850460	4854500	great idea for sirs cuz I haven't played secret how long does that game take to
4854500	4858340	beat though it's a really long time isn't it it's a yeah I think you can be
4858340	4867460	in one sitting oh unless we marathon did switched out who would be crazy the
4867460	4871180	doctors taking pictures in studio I don't know why I'm just kidding so but
4871180	4876420	um yeah the secret about a marathon would be fun I actually got really far
4876420	4879500	and secret to evermore I got really close to beating it I never did though I
4879500	4885220	don't think evermore is nearly as bad as some people think it was yeah oh yeah
4885220	4891820	Wow you know you know we should do we should do RPG a month seriously good
4891820	4897860	luck tearing me away from Wow but here's Rob's RPG of life maybe on oh
4897860	4901060	something else about secret evermore cuz another song we played in that break
4901060	4905900	was the theme to Guild Wars which I think that composer that does the the
4905900	4910020	soundtrack to Guild Wars Jeremy soule I think is how you say his last name is
4910020	4914220	really talented and he composed that when he was like a practically teenager
4914220	4918380	like 19 or 20 I think he did secret evermore like when he was a teenager he
4918380	4923460	actually I think composed that soundtrack so cray-cray crazy right so I
4923460	4925980	think actually no I think it take the bat he was 19 when he did I think the
4925980	4928880	secret evermore stuff and then later on probably in his 20s he did the Gil war
4928880	4931780	stuff but he was very young when he did a lot of that and he did the music to
4931780	4935620	oblivion which I know you're not a big fan of that game but the soundtrack is a
4935620	4941560	amazing yeah he's a talented guy so he did the music to pray which even though
4941560	4944900	it was kind of a and for actually it's one of the few first-person shooters I
4944900	4948920	really really really liked and you know why because it was made for people who
4948920	4952060	are terrible at first-person shooters because you never die you cannot die and
4952060	4957100	pray it's easy mode when you die you go into the spirit world where you have to
4957100	4961280	shoot these like ghost looking things to regain your health and stuff and then
4961280	4965440	you go back right where you left off so pray is like total easy mode but it had
4965440	4969540	really good music so anyway cool there you go
4969540	4974420	chat that orange lounge radio.com you're playing plants versus zombies salacious
4974420	4978020	pop and chat says people who hated evermore were just being 16 year old
4978020	4981540	weeaboo square stands and didn't like it because it was square USA developed and
4981540	4985060	Rama is starting to fight saying actually no it took a week to beat
4985060	4991940	that's why let's throw down you know what it had a dog in it instantly cool
4991940	4996460	so there you go all right let's get back into some more video game news here
4996460	5000620	Twitter topics coming up at twitter.com slash olr just a little bit so make sure

5238780	5243380	that didn't see it it's like real have you guys seen the rice princess started
5243380	5246940	watching it but then I realized it was Pokemon and I was just like it's like
5246940	5250020	somebody took Pokemon and made it real life and it's like obviously like a
5250020	5253140	student project or something was like a big-budget student project like it's
5253140	5258980	it's crazy how kind of the team rocket things are all you know the sci-fi of or
5258980	5262340	the the the effects were good enough for sci-fi television because that's what
5262340	5265220	the special effects look like was like the really bad like shark to post kind
5265220	5272220	of effects so that's awesome yeah just saying so I got this got me thinking
5272220	5275220	here because again you know there's folks in chat talking about like
5275220	5277940	role-playing games and stuff a salacious pop is saying you know what I really
5277940	5280980	enjoyed Final Fantasy mystic quest because I played it knowing it was kitty
5280980	5283540	you know that game wasn't as terrible as everybody out made it to be it just
5283540	5288140	wasn't Final Fantasy just like 11 but actually I think dark soccer might be
5288140	5291180	onto something with the role-playing game of the month you know I have an
5291180	5295660	idea what do you think like we pick like a role-playing game like a classic of
5295660	5301540	some sort that we would see who can get the furthest in like a month and then we
5301540	5307100	could have like a blog of how we're doing in the game and submit screenshots
5307100	5310020	and stuff like that why are you laughing rice princess because I think the first
5310020	5314420	game should be earthbound well maybe even lose maybe the first game can't be
5314420	5317060	earthbound I don't know what do you think dark side do you like this idea
5317060	5320860	should we should we have like a classic role-playing game that we all have to
5320860	5324540	play I can already tell you I would I would freaking lose because I have
5324540	5332700	school we'll have work yeah but work doesn't give you homework sometimes they
5332700	5340940	do actually so maybe maybe we should just pick like one night where we've got
5340940	5347740	nothing going on and do do this do the Zelda fest what what no I saw a
5347740	5351140	role-playing on a Zelda fest quit trying to change something no it's like the
5351140	5356740	Zelda fest we see who can get the furthest ah okay okay by like a certain
5356740	5360940	time limit we could do something like that could be interesting fun or be like
5360940	5364420	still playing damn plants versus zombies because I recognize the music because it
5364420	5369500	plays in my sleep now and SSG 100 Matt says this will happen when Rob and Jamie
5369500	5374780	actually play their magic card battle yeah that was like a year ago right no I
5374780	5379700	found them recently magic all right I have to let me get back into some quick
5379700	5383420	news here this is news that makes me very happy and I know to make Loki very
5383420	5388060	very happy rumors abound once again that Capcom is indeed working on a new
5388060	5393420	Mega Man Legends game this is as they should be this is a source telling
5393420	5398660	Mega Man fansite Rockman Corner that apparently a new game in this series
5398660	5402980	that started on the PlayStation 1 is in development they're not confirming that
5402980	5407020	it's called Mega Man Legends 3 but they are saying it's the next entry in the
5407020	5409580	series which makes it would make sense to me that it's not gonna be like
5409580	5413460	Mega Man Legends 3 it'll be like Mega Man Legends with some subtitle that acts
5413460	5417820	as like a reboot because you know it's been a good what eight years at least
5417820	5422620	since we've seen the last game in the series so yeah this project right now is
5422620	5426300	very very secretive and not a lot of information is available now you might
5426300	5429380	just say well okay anybody could pull out of their ass that they're working on
5429380	5434540	a new Mega Man Legends game what brings this some clout to it the tipster that
5434540	5439620	is bringing this to the attention of Rockman Corner is called the shadow and
5439620	5442820	you have to trust the shadow because Alec Baldwin played him no but the
5442820	5447500	shadow also pegged the release date of Mega Man 9 and some of the very specific
5447500	5451900	details in the game so it's somebody who has kind of done this before so who
5451900	5457720	knows could be very cool I'm excited I would love to see kind of something we
5457720	5460580	didn't get to tonight but I know had been floating around out there was a
5460580	5465900	Mega Man Doom mod that made Doom look like Mega Man Legends kind of it was it
5465900	5470940	was actually kind of awesome I have to admit so we have let's see when the
5470940	5474140	Kinect comes out we're going to have dance masters from Konami we're gonna
5474140	5478620	have dance central from harmonix well guess what overseas they're getting a
5478620	5483100	game called dance paradise in Europe it's coming from mindscape and you're
5483100	5487100	universal music it's gonna be coming out when the Kinect comes out no word on a
5487100	5491900	release over here but just to give you a kind of a heads up on what to expect in
5491900	5495420	this game since it is a partnership with Universal Music you do have some pretty
5495420	5499300	big names in this for instance David Guetta and Kelly Rowland when love takes
5499300	5504060	over Gwen Stefani what you waiting for Lady Gaga bad romance LaRue
5504060	5508700	bulletproof MC Hammer can't touch this no doubt hey baby
5508700	5512620	Sophie Ellis I just I love that all of those songs were in the last few months
5512620	5517340	and then MC Hammer with Kentucky from 30 years ago so feel it but it's a classic
5517340	5522420	Sophie Ellis Beckster with murder on the dance floor and the doctor's favorite
5522420	5528180	song Jerry Halliwell with its raining men remember MC Hammer needs money well
5528180	5531540	you know as you know but then I'm looking at screenshots of the game and
5531540	5534500	I'm kind of like oh this looks like it's gonna be like kind of a cheap hack of a
5534500	5538580	game I don't know I don't know if it looks really that good but the song list
5538580	5545420	is is pretty darn good because they did team up with Universal Music so hmm so
5545420	5551420	20 of the 40 songs have been announced so far so yeah I don't know interested
5551420	5555900	to see more in that also one other story there's rumors going around this week
5555900	5561140	that project Milo was canceled this week 19 contractors that were working on the
5561140	5564460	project were let go some of the other people that were on the project are
5564460	5568460	going to be using the technology in a new fable themed connect game when your
5568460	5574620	game doesn't have a title it's probably not going to come out yet I agree with
5574620	5578260	last week's statement from that it was basically the creepy pedo in the yard
5578260	5583380	game like just watching those videos was scary so lion head isn't gonna comment
5583380	5588940	on rumors or speculation but it's looking like yeah might not happen by
5588940	5592380	the way Peter Molyneux was quoted in the past few months saying that Milo is
5592380	5596340	basically a very very big tech demo so maybe that was the hint that the
5596340	5601420	beginning of the end was coming so that's all I've got dark Sakura I got
5601420	5607620	some stuff how about rock band we have the download content coming out that
5607620	5613580	will be a lot of anthrax woohoo I love anthrax so the anthrax pack will be
5613580	5619740	among the living I'm the man Indians mad house which I love that song and metal
5619740	5625060	thrashing mad actually the later two are live versions and the whole pack will be
5625060	5630460	680 Microsoft points for individual tracks coming out stuff again that I
5630460	5635500	have to get my chemical romance I'm not okay and welcome to the black parade
5635500	5639940	totally totally want both of those 30 seconds to Mars closer to the edge a
5639940	5644460	tray of coffin nails buck cherry out of line and two doobie brothers tracks
5644460	5647660	listen to the music and long train running I still can't believe there's a
5647660	5653700	band called Atreyu there's a band saying there's a band called ludo all right
5653700	5659380	that's awesome yes and they're pretty cool so as far as other stuff how about
5659380	5667780	cave story there is going to be a DSI where and what I heard a gasp I just I
5667780	5670660	like cave story now looks really cool if there's that a screenshot that we're
5670660	5673420	looking at here that's cool like updated version of the cave story graphics on
5673420	5681700	the screen well and basically yeah and actually yeah it's um commission if this
5681700	5687100	picture was commissioned in honor of the announcement so I guess it's a maybe an
5687100	5692860	idea of what it might be could be like but at any rate it's going to be a DSI
5692860	5698460	where a version of the game and it will they say it's done they're just testing
5698460	5709180	it and it's apparently going to I have a classic one and an update and then last
5709180	5714660	but not least Donkey Kong Country for Wii it's called Donkey Kong Country
5714660	5720540	Returns and it comes with a banana pocket for your it's like a condom for
5720540	5726820	your condom for your Wii it kept anyway it comes with this banana thing that you
5726820	5735060	can put your wiimote into so double banana it's a banana pouch I just keep
5735060	5746660	thinking maybe I'm just banana it's a penis joke at any rate if you pre-order
5746660	5752500	it you get beta access and downloadable skins and the bananas are probably
5752500	5757820	limited edition should be out on November 21st like anyone gives a crap

6203020	6207300	stuff random things we will send out on the Twitter as well like pictures and
6207300	6210620	all that cool stuff all right back into some more news Loki what do you got for
6210620	6220180	us I've got plants versus always not I've got some cool stuff including you
6220180	6225180	may remember some of the things that Sony does to you know curb piracy and
6225180	6234340	stuff well now they've disabled it's funny because everybody's joking oh now
6234340	6238780	they have those USB mod chips they're gonna disable the USB ports I only
6238780	6245460	weren't that far off they've disabled some USB peripherals I guess according
6245460	6251580	to a report that was on their website the issue I guess they were disabling
6251580	6258620	counterfeit ps3 controllers but it was actually disabling third our unlicensed
6258620	6265020	third-party controllers in some of these devices affected by this actually were
6265020	6271940	the yobo ps3 joybox which I believe is an arcade stick the XCM cross battle
6271940	6278220	plus adapter which was kind of a adapter lie you use an Xbox 360 controller on
6278220	6283700	the PlayStation 3 and the split the split fish frag FX which is kind of a
6283700	6290780	hybrid controller and mouse and that's kind of lame that that's part of firmware
6290780	6296260	3.5 other things though that it kind of broke as well some old mad cats
6296260	6301660	controllers even though they are fully licensed apparently they are now broken
6301660	6309860	so if you only 2008 wireless ps3 gamepad or the 2008 wired ps3 gamepad or the
6309860	6314700	ps3 wireless micro con which is now discontinued they do not work anymore
6314700	6322900	so man if I were mad cats I would be pissed like especially if they're
6322900	6327260	licensed if they're unlicensed well then too bad so sad right but if they're
6327260	6334260	licensed that's grounds to like sue and stuff yes soon well and I don't know if
6334260	6341660	this is like meant to stop people from using the USB mod chips but that last
6341660	6346900	firmware update was to stop people from using the USB mod chips so I can only
6346900	6352340	assume this is either an extra precaution or they're just being dicks
6352340	6356140	I'm gonna go with the latter I think they're being dicks because really I
6356140	6359700	don't know about you but I haven't heard of some big ol mass problem with
6359700	6364020	counterfeit controllers I don't know people out there going oh man all those
6364020	6369100	counterfeit controllers out there I just can't find a good ps3 controller well
6369100	6372660	there are a lot of shitty controllers out there actually yeah but these are
6372660	6376380	actually counterfeit controllers there's a YouTube that was on Kotaku as well
6376380	6381500	where someone actually bought a cheap DualShock 3 controller that was a
6381500	6389860	counterfeit so you know that's kind of lame that those are out there but I mean
6389860	6394940	I can't imagine this is a huge problem that one that warrants a software update
6394940	6398980	I mean hell I can think of a lot of problems that this console has it
6398980	6405940	haven't been fixed with a software update like home being lame nice all
6405940	6410420	right well how would you like to get free Microsoft points that's right free
6410420	6413860	Microsoft points well guess what there's a website that will bribe you with free
6413860	6418220	Microsoft points they're keeping it in the family because that website is Bing
6418220	6423700	that's right Microsoft search engine the rival to Google Bing is running this new
6423700	6429500	little like Bing toolbar that you can install on your browser by the way well
6429500	6432440	at the first announcement said that it was only compatible with Internet
6432440	6435580	Explorer but some things I've been reading in forum chats and stuff say
6435580	6438860	that it actually works with Firefox so I don't know you I mean it would make
6438860	6441860	sense it would only work with Internet Explorer right that whole like
6441860	6447500	Microsoft only stuff but anyhow if you use it to take part in daily promotions
6447500	6452120	or do searching you will earn reward points that you can then turn into
6452120	6456200	Microsoft points so here's the thing though you can only get the Microsoft
6456200	6460460	points in 100 point denominations but just installing the toolbar gets you
6460460	6465460	250 points so that's kind of cool I guess so what I'm also hearing though
6465460	6468700	again the reading through comments and things is apparently they will only like
6468700	6478220	send you the the points in like cards in the mail like what a waste of cardboard
6478220	6480940	and all that stuff like when they could be sending it to you digitally cuz like
6480940	6487100	you know a hundred Microsoft points is like a buck 25 seriously yeah I'm gonna
6487100	6491180	try it with Firefox have fun give me your Microsoft points and Microsoft is
6491180	6495860	desperate to get Bing off the ground like they're trying all kinds of stuff
6495860	6499540	well you know what's interesting it's not a bad site actually their maps is
6499540	6503160	actually really cool and in some ways it's even better than Google like it's
6503160	6506500	actually caused Google to have to kind of like up some of the aunties on some
6506500	6510220	of their things like the satellite pictures and stuff so you know Bing it
6510220	6513220	has some pretty neat stuff going for it I mean it's not terrible just because
6513220	6519620	it's Microsoft I keep seeing advertisements and like being this and
6519620	6523540	being automatically like download itself on my toolbar and bing bing bing bing
6523540	6527820	and it's just like bada-bing and yeah exactly exactly I like that they have
6527820	6534260	like a neat little picture every day and they're their application on did it oh
6534260	6540100	no did it maybe I was trying to click cancel and I click the other thing so
6540100	6543300	now it closed all my windows great and it means you closed your next story
6543300	6552180	didn't it yay awesome oh well that's what I have an iPhone for you're gonna
6552180	6555860	bring up stories on the iPhone why not all right well I got a stretch for time
6555860	6559340	here I was ready to go on to the next story you know what Rob sometimes things
6559340	6562980	just don't go the way you expect them to hey don't be rude I wasn't being rude
6562980	6567620	being a realist Bing has pretty pictures on it that's not like about being when
6567620	6571180	you go to their website and the iPhone app is actually kind of neat I don't
6571180	6575620	have an iPhone really would you like to touch mine no it's got your finger juice
6575620	6585300	on it yes you may okay have my story yay all right because this is the joy of the
6585300	6591940	iPhone oh great now it's not loading sucker me at Miyamoto it basically what
6591940	6595620	the story is about is that Miyamoto has always considered the maker of the
6595620	6601620	Rubik's Cube mr. Rubik himself to be his rival so he wants to make something
6601620	6606980	along the lines of a Rubik's Cube as his big pet project so like selling a
6606980	6611780	bazillion wheeze isn't good enough no
6612500	6618780	basically he said and I'm gonna quote for quite some time I have viewed
6618780	6622700	professor Rubik who created the Rubik's Cube as a sort of rival I've always
6622700	6625900	thought it would be cool to create something like a Rubik's Cube I've told
6625900	6629380	lots of people about that for 20 years of us thought that the Rubik's cubes are
6629380	6632140	great they've all left him and I wanted to make something like that but I still
6632140	6639100	haven't tried to do so I must be taking it easy Wow and then he said he wanted
6639100	6644460	to be a manga artist oh he just wants to do everything doesn't he you know what
6644460	6648660	he's created some of the most memorable video game characters ever like that
6648660	6653780	history will never forget some of these video game characters and yet it's just
6653780	6661220	not good enough for him no and well he was said that he did some comic strips
6661220	6666700	for um Tezuka who's the Nintendo ad general manager wait wait what which
6666700	6669940	characters are you talking about that he created you know the ones that we would
6669940	6674540	never forget was that like Captain Rainbow or something do you remember
6674540	6679820	Captain Rainbow good point from a dark Tetsuya in chat room didn't Nintendo
6679820	6683660	used to make toys and stuff back in the 70s actually Nintendo started off as a
6683660	6688660	Hanafuda card yeah they did it playing cards right yeah hmm and then they did
6688660	6695420	Game & Watch I love Game & Watch it works with Firefox well thank you now I
6695420	6699580	enjoy your Microsoft points I will good time what are you gonna buy with those
6699580	6705660	Microsoft points probably the rest of the steampunk outfit on my avatar all
6705660	6710060	right Loki it's your turn you gonna put down plants versus zombies and actually
6710060	6716980	sorry I can do this so there's other Sony news and this would kind of tie in
6716980	6721220	with the stuff that happened before when they were moving things to stop hacking
6721220	6726740	remember they removed the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3 to stop the
6726740	6733180	hacking of the system via Linux well apparently there was a class-action
6733180	6739220	lawsuit filed against Sony because of that and Sony has now filed a motion to
6739220	6743220	dismiss that class-action lawsuit brought against the company and sadly
6743220	6749220	enough I kind of agree with them because well you'll see for example they say
6749220	6758380	that I guess apparently some of the seven I guess similar suits they were
6758380	6762900	all consolidated their file last thing it says fails to present evidence that
6762900	6767140	the company overtly advertise the other OS and its marketing campaigns on the
6767140	6771700	p4 on the ps3 packaging which I don't remember them doing either one of those
6771700	6776380	but I do remember them talking about it at e3 so or z3 or game developers
6776380	6781500	conference camera which one this is Sony also claims that the ps3 warranty
6781500	6785460	license agreement in the PlayStation Network terms of service specifically
6785460	6792480	provide ps3 purchasers with a license non ownership interest in the software
6792480	6797500	and use of the PlayStation Network provided that Sony has the right to
6797500	6801900	disable or alter your software features or terminate or limit the access to the
6801900	6806820	PlayStation Network it by issuing firmware updates and also I guess that
6806820	6813780	apparently people do have the option to keep the other OS by declining the
6813780	6817140	update and they just can't access the PlayStation Network
6817140	6823220	so in other words in other words they're saying you can access this feature by
6823220	6829460	disabling a different feature instead yes also they're saying that because
6829460	6835540	some of the the they should you know dismiss the suit because some of the
6835540	6844580	plaintiffs did not use the other OS feature in fact there is you have it
6844580	6848900	didn't use it in the same way I guess and or just didn't use it all because
6848900	6855140	you know they have ways of checking that and so I guess they wouldn't really have
6855140	6859580	been affected by it it's some people I think doing a money grab if you ask me
6859580	6864940	so I'm sure some people are just like that earlier story we had about APB and
6864940	6867460	all the people complaining the yeah but there's some people that are gonna go
6867460	6870980	try to get money that really didn't even play APB they just bought it well that's
6870980	6874620	different though I mean they'd have proof of purchase of you know APB they
6874620	6878660	give them the serial number or something like that that this is a little
6878660	6885060	different than saying oh you know I I don't know like for example a
6885060	6889900	class-action lawsuit that I was part of just because I hate 24-hour fitness I
6889900	6893460	canceled my 24-hour fitness membership and there was a class-action lawsuit
6893460	6897020	saying that there was people affected by the fact that when you cancel your
6897020	6901780	membership they bill you a couple more times just really yeah did that happen
6901780	6906380	to you no it didn't happen to me that's what I still got I got a $5 check I got
6906380	6911780	a three month pass to 24-hour fitness I'm like oh garbage thank you it's like
6911780	6918060	wonderful I can't wait to go back to the gym I don't like going to thank you this
6918060	6920900	is way better than any other compensation you could possibly provide
6920900	6925260	me nice very nice Lisa should be able to kick them in the pants or something yeah
6925260	6929460	going to our chat room at chat orange laundry calm for such eloquent comments
6929460	6933300	such as the one from Toa gak who says Sony can suck a dick what they did was
6933300	6939580	wrong do you agree rice princess can Sony suck a dick they probably could
6939580	6945460	collectively yeah let's see why not Derek H in our chair room says that's
6945460	6949740	like a car company removing your seat belts because you didn't use them that's
6949740	6952900	actually a pretty good comparison except for the fact that I don't think the
6952900	6956740	other OS is gonna like you know save your life at any point I guess maybe it
6956740	6965540	could I guess anything's possible don't make assumptions wrong all right going
6965540	6971260	on to more stories in our show here another rumor going around and this is
6971260	6979460	about more 3d games I know right I'm already over it but apparently there are
6979460	6985060	yet more rumored ports of PlayStation 2 games being remade for the PlayStation
6985060	6989240	3 and in 3d one of them I've got to admit sounds really interesting it's the
6989240	6995020	Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection and if you're looking at a sample box art
6995020	6999820	that's out there it's Mortal Kombat 1 2 and ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 kind of
6999820	7004620	redone in HD I gotta admit that being that I love the cheesy Mortal Kombat
7004620	7007460	games from back in the day that actually sounds kind of awesome I'm not gonna lie
7007460	7011580	being able to you know play that in three in well I wouldn't play in 3d but
7011580	7017780	HD and all that jazz not interested rice princess you don't like Mortal Kombat
7017780	7024900	it's alright I can play it in its normal form I guess that's true apparently it's
7024900	7029580	gonna have stereoscopic 3d support and this is being reported by a French
7029580	7033140	gaming website but they have box art to go with it and I don't know it's coming
7033140	7039420	out oh well then I believe it what about the Prince of Persia trilogy 3d that's
7039420	7042580	the other one that's being remember about that one yet only if it has video
7042580	7046580	of Jake Gyllenhaal me I can imagine that they would because everybody's kind of
7046580	7049900	jumping on that bandwagon of re-releasing stuff hey I'm okay with
7049900	7052740	that Prince of Persia games are pretty awesome it's the sands of time or you're
7052740	7055800	within and the two thrones all coming out sounds like they'd be a perfect tie
7055800	7059740	in with the DVD release of the movie now wouldn't it wouldn't it and the Mortal
7059740	7062780	Kombat HD collection might make the perfect companion piece to the new
7062780	7067300	Mortal Kombat game wouldn't it how about Jake Gyllenhaal and the oncoming
7067300	7073180	something I don't know never mind I try to make sex jokes around you Robin I
7073180	7077460	just can't because I'm distracted by you it's I'm not sure how to take that but I
7077460	7084100	think compliment interesting Derek H says they should remake every game with
7084100	7088500	parallax backgrounds in 3d that might actually happen on the 3ds actually if
7088500	7094260	what we saw at a most a classic gaming Expo I'd even fucking go to that what am
7094260	7099980	I thinking at e3 is any indication cuz you know they had like the Xevious this
7099980	7105340	old old old Namco game from like the 80s was redone in 3d pac-man yeah they had
7105340	7110300	Star Fox was redone they were talking about like redoing ocarina of time
7110300	7117060	they're gonna go back and redo all these games in 3d you know why it's because
7117060	7121540	they can just take the code they already have tack on 3d and re-release a damn
7121540	7127700	game again just like we can take some GameCube games tack on we remote waggle
7127700	7131060	and re-release it hey look we're supporting the fans because we released
7131060	7136780	lots of games this year new games uh oh I'm sorry that would actually be just
7136780	7140900	game you've got to admit a game like pilot wings would be kind of awesome in
7140900	7144780	3d like I have to me okay here's the thing though rice friends let's keep
7144780	7147900	this in mind I don't like 3d either like I don't like hearing about all these
7147900	7153220	movies and things that are in 3d but the 3ds is for some reason is different like
7153220	7157060	a you can turn off the 3d when it bugs you because it has a slider that lets
7157060	7160620	you adjust the intensity so it's easier on your eyes and it is kind of a neat
7160620	7164220	effect I gotta say being able to see the 3d without glasses is kind of cool I
7164220	7168420	don't know how long that'll last but here's something that kind of has me
7168420	7171300	thinking you know for the longest time we've been wondering where our virtual
7171300	7174100	console games on the DSI where our virtual console games and virtual
7174100	7178700	consoles kind of slowed up lately what if a lot of these re-releases with 3d
7178700	7183860	end up being downloadable games for the DSI like they're gonna re-release these
7183860	7187540	games all over again but this time they're in 3d I mean if the price is
7187540	7192660	right like five ten dollars could be worth it for some of these games only
7192660	7196140	the only the real real classics like I wouldn't buy games like princess tomato
7196140	7199980	and salad Kingdom or whatever are what are you talking about my favorite game
7199980	7205220	ever shut up no I wouldn't want to play clash and demon head in 3d no you're
7205220	7209300	fixing something that's not broken I don't know it it's not worth it to me
7209300	7214180	why would I pay for it again you know it was fine how it was before and you know
7214180	7221780	if I want 3d I'll just go into real I hear they have 3d in real they
7221780	7227460	apparently yes they do so I mean I don't know I'm just not down with the 3d I
7227460	7231180	still want a 3ds though you got it you got to check one out when they you know
7231180	7234860	I'll watch you play with now does it actually look like the stuffs coming out
7234860	7238980	of the screen no it's going into the going in the screen it's like looking
7238980	7244100	through a through a window into a three dimension imagine not like they're
7244100	7251740	looking for a real window at the naked woman in the window your description
7251740	7257580	of it makes me think of like the old head tracking thing with a wiimote hack
7257580	7260620	that's what it makes me think of well if you think about how the 3ds really works
7260620	7264260	with all the prisms and stuff basically sending a different image to each eye it
7264260	7270620	kind of makes sense how it looks when you see it I know but some of it here's
7270620	7274300	the thing but then some of the 3d effects what they do is they put the
7274300	7280060	main image on the very very back plane so that way when there's 3d effects it
7280060	7283420	does look like things are coming forward because they'll put the static image on
7283420	7286580	the very last plane in the very back and then things are shooting out like there
7286580	7289220	was one little demo they were showing out on the floor that was somebody
7289220	7292620	opening a champagne bottle in slow motion and the champagne goes everywhere
7292620	7296820	well it's just to show off the technology yeah like all I think of when
7296820	7302820	I think of that is just Nintendo saying we're Nintendo give me your money give
7302820	7307620	me your money people give them their money I know there's still one console
7307620	7311460	and I'm just worried that this one this gimmick fades like it will that the 3ds
7311460	7314540	I mean what's you know we you know you hope that would be around for a few
7314540	7318100	years but it's just gonna die every seven-year-old is going to want one
7318100	7321940	every single seven-year-old here's the thing though it doesn't matter that if
7321940	7326140	it if the 3d stuff fails because the other thing they can do is they can have
7326140	7329460	a nice because the top screen is like twice the resolution is the bottom
7329460	7334340	screen they can have a nice HD screen or they can also just use the extra
7334340	7341460	processing power to make really nice games well we'll see again a system is
7341460	7344020	only as good as the games that are on it and there are a lot of very promising
7344020	7348580	developers hopping in on it although again it's portable gaming and I'm not
7348580	7352460	always the biggest fan of portable games but if it can give me something that the
7352460	7358660	television games can't 3d in this case might be worth a look I don't know as if
7358660	7361820	it has really really really great games that necessitated I'm gonna have to go
7361820	7367260	well you can go ahead and spend your money I'm poor I'm just gonna have to go
7367260	7376100	buy a virtual boy you can only steal one oh my god that's a great idea no bad
7376100	7381100	idea never mind forget I said that all right let's go to the mailbag every week
7381100	7385260	you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer is
7385260	7389460	gonna open up the email bag dive in headfirst try not to drowned under the
7389460	7393700	massive emails that are in there try not to inhale into the anthrax that comes
7393700	7402060	with the messages you read a few all right this one is from lab rat y2k I
7402060	7405580	just finished a journey into my own gaming vault this trip had me play
7405580	7410300	earthbound mother in Japan for the SNES for the first time it's like they read
7410300	7414840	rice princesses mind I know I can't speak highly enough of this game it had
7414840	7418740	a great story and I found that I actually cared about the NPCs additionally
7418740	7422380	I truly enjoyed the humor this is something that's been missing from most
7422380	7426580	of the recent JRPGs if you haven't covered this on your retro gaming
7426580	7432140	segment it would definitely be worth consideration lab rat y2k I concur
7432140	7436500	greeting well now if you don't play it all the way to the very very end where
7436500	7439500	you actually beat it then be careful because rice princess will make fun of
7439500	7442200	you for the rest of your life so you better play it to completion it's true
7442200	7448580	don't just play the first town like Rob did I played at least four towns are you
7448580	7453100	sure about that I had a full party of people like you don't get that until
7453100	7459700	like practically halfway through the game stop laughing at me bitch
7459700	7465620	greetings again from Rob above hi I have been hoping and waiting for Verizon to
7465620	7469100	get an iPhone contract because I'm shopping for a phone keep on waiting
7469100	7473420	let's imagine that if it became reality I have some pretty good reasons to
7473420	7477380	believe that apps that use the network for gaming or social networking will not
7477380	7482700	work between AT&T and Verizon the only ones that will are the ones that push
7482700	7486260	and pull things via the internet like Facebook or Twitter app I think this
7486260	7488820	will be an eye-opening disappointment I hope I'm wrong
7488820	7495140	imagine iPhones with babies from Rob above I know I'm not sure I follow the
7495140	7500740	logic there why they wouldn't work because of them using the networks the
7500740	7505140	time for networks I mean if the bandwidth is different than some network
7505140	7508700	or some apps might have problems like things like Netflix and so forth but I
7508700	7512020	would think that if a Verizon iPhone goes out of the marketplace the band was
7512020	7515180	only gonna get better because there's you know gonna be more of it available
7515180	7518540	there'll be a bunch of people that get off of AT&T's network that'll make it
7518540	7521420	easier for them and then there'll be people on Verizon's now where it's kind
7521420	7526940	of like you know spreading it out a little bit I don't know next email hey
7526940	7532100	hey with the plans versus zombies talk on last show it brings to focus my
7532100	7535820	addiction to the game on Steam looking over my playtime is almost depressing
7535820	7541140	portal two hours half-life 2 one of the best first-person shooters made 44
7541140	7545580	minutes team fortress 2 2 hours torchlight 8 hours plants versus zombies
7545580	7550340	game of the year edition 40 hours Wow hopefully I'll have the chance to give
7550340	7553880	the other games the playtime they deserve in the meantime I'm really
7553880	7557580	hoping that next year's plants versus zombies DS game will feature the
7557580	7563620	multiplayer elements of the 360 release keep us big keep podcasting and stay
7563620	7567740	something Robert M it's like the listeners are reading our minds this
7567740	7570700	week with the whole like plants versus zombies like everybody's talking about
7570700	7573100	how they've been playing that even though that game is a good year or two
7573100	7579420	old at this point it's cuz you're psychic Rob shut up no no no okay
7579420	7583380	greetings all our it's your favorite your friendly neighborhood turtle here I
7583380	7586980	just wanted to thank you so much for the marathon show actually listen to the
7586980	7592700	entire podcast in one long day of work I was worn out after that anywho I think
7592700	7597660	the idea of Blizzcon is stupid but is anyone besides me pulling out their hair
7597660	7602300	while waiting for any news about Diablo 3 back in the day of Diablo 2 I never
7602300	7607700	used any form of voiceover IP and still spent hundreds of hours playing it I
7607700	7612740	can't imagine the addiction this time around keep up the great work on the
7612740	7616820	best structured most informational and best podcast running on the internet to
7616820	7624260	your local your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle a serious turtle yes
7624260	7627500	serious turtle I have been pulling my hair out over Diablo 3 in fact I've
7627500	7632860	pulled out a whole little clump in the back in a nice little circle but I am
7632860	7637820	I'm actually really excited about Diablo 3 all things considered it's it's been
7637820	7642100	way too long since the first game World of Warcraft honestly feels like more
7642100	7645660	like World of Diablo to me in the way it plays it's just in the Warcraft
7645660	7650980	mythology so I'm I'm I'm very excited about Diablo 3 and I think I brought
7650980	7653020	this up on the show before I think there's definitely when it comes to
7653020	7656260	Blizzard two different camps there's the Starcraft people and there's a Diablo
7656260	7660940	people and not a lot of crossover I appreciate Starcraft I bought it it's
7660940	7664820	fun I see why people like it but I didn't really play it to completion
7664820	7668700	because I never play games completion anymore let's face it but Diablo 3 oh
7668700	7679060	it's on because you're not Korean yes it's because I'm not Korean no I'm
7679060	7684420	reading anyway dear olr I was listening to Loki's failtastic Apple metaphor and
7684420	7688620	thought I'd take a crack at it so I want to take me and a bunch of my friends out
7688620	7692380	to a restaurant I could just get takeout and have a party at home but I like the
7692380	7695860	experience that comes with dining out also I don't want my house getting
7695860	7699860	trashed so I treat my friends to dinner at a semi-fine restaurant paying for the
7699860	7703340	entire meal because I'm a nerd with a full-time job the restaurant presumably
7703340	7706900	includes the cost of the dining experience waiters dishes silverware bad
7706900	7711500	music random crap on the walls etc in with the cost of the meal because if
7711500	7714780	people saw what this actually cost they might not choose to enjoy the dining
7714780	7719820	experience this cost comes to me because I'm the one paying however if the
7719820	7722780	restaurant is an establishment that makes each individual person pay for
7722780	7726620	their own dining experience and I'm not going to stand out in front of a
7726620	7731260	restaurant yell fuck you and fuck your fucking dining fee instead I will give
7731260	7734140	my business to different restaurant that doesn't charge outrageous dining fees
7734140	7738340	that ladies and gentlemen is how to craft a metaphor stay black
7738340	7742980	entertainment this message is brought to you by 2x plus 2y minus 8 equals 4y
7742980	7751300	solve for X the answer by the way is X equals 4y minus y plus 4 sorry you

7981220	7985780	open at 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange launcher do but not yet
7985780	7990180	because we have two more stories to go look yeah yes um I told people to get
7990180	7993800	their dialing fingers ready they're dialing fingers it's like playing flame
7993800	8005100	and finger I'm waiting Microsoft getting a taste of money because of halo reach
8005100	8010020	has decided you know what maybe one halo game every three years not frequent
8010020	8016060	enough we need to be putting out more halo games and they're saying you know
8016060	8022900	probably I guess Phil Spencer this is Microsoft's VP they're saying it's a
8022900	8027140	matter of keeping players engaged and not going dark for two years at a time
8027140	8031980	they want to do what Activision has done with Call of Duty which is whore that
8031980	8038880	bitch out like no other and they said I used to look at annual releases of non
8038880	8044460	sports games as people just like just trying to milk me I figured nobody had
8044460	8047940	enough time to do a good job and all the negatives that would associate with
8047940	8051780	those kinds of scenarios kudos Activision because they've done a good
8051780	8057740	job putting good game continuing to release each year I think the fans like
8057740	8063620	it and it's a good thing that they do it that way that's because they had two
8063620	8068700	different developers working on it I don't know if that's gonna work with
8068700	8074380	halo do you think that halo is just gonna go really downhill now that a
8074380	8078500	different studios gonna be developing it oh yeah I mean especially if it sounds
8078500	8081060	like they're gonna try to crank them out as fast as possible that sounds
8081060	8085860	dangerous just do not put roughing games on halo because they really fucked up
8085860	8092820	crackdown too um do you think they're gonna try and crank out a halo game
8092820	8096900	again as early as next year that because if that's the case and somebody's
8096900	8102700	already working on it I don't know we'll have to see I it's just gonna get to the
8102700	8107180	point though see with Call of Duty even you know the modern warfare was really
8107180	8112460	awesome and then modern warfare 2 was still very awesome and world at war that
8112460	8116420	came out in between that was just kind of like it's alright but still people
8116420	8120660	went and played the one game so people aren't necessarily buying every year's
8120660	8124820	you know iteration of the game and that's also another thing that's really
8124820	8127660	hard to do it when you're putting a really good multiplayer game is like
8127660	8132300	halo reach for example people will be playing halo region till the next halo
8132300	8136980	game comes out but if it keeps coming out each year and if like some of them
8136980	8143500	happen to suck or maybe are made by Treyarch then people might not give a
8143500	8150220	shit anymore I just you know I hope they don't take a respectable name and really
8150220	8155860	drive it into the ground but then again fresh blood isn't always a bad thing it
8155860	8159660	could be cool just most of the time it could be cool but the thing is like
8159660	8166460	Microsoft they need more franchises seein you know fables a great game I
8166460	8176420	guess I fucking hate peeler Molinos so much why he's such a prick seriously our
8176420	8179980	game is so awesome it does all these things other games don't do you're gonna
8179980	8184860	really care for this dog really I cared so much I stopped playing months ago
8184860	8190540	this dog's gonna come your life no he's annoying he's like hey dig here there's
8190540	8194860	treasure here dig here dig here dig here there's treasure here you can raise your
8194860	8199700	family and it's so wonderful this time you're gonna be able to be the king or
8199700	8203340	queen of your kingdom you have to run it and things are gonna happen you're gonna
8203340	8208380	have your dog still because everybody loves dog and and it's really amazing
8208380	8213540	and we're gonna do this project Milo shit that's gonna be so wonderful you're
8213540	8217500	gonna interact with this kid like you're interacting with a real kid don't play
8217500	8220460	with your kids your kids can interact with this kid just like you're
8220460	8227900	interacting with real friends because they don't have real friends oh he's
8227900	8234580	just so annoying with his leg new technology and shit and I'm sorry like
8234580	8238580	here's the thing he comes out saying that these games are gonna be so much
8238580	8243500	more incredible than the last game because of all these reasons and they're
8243500	8247980	like nearly identical to the last year's release it's like what happened all this
8247980	8250580	innovation that you're gonna put in there because this game is kind of
8250580	8254700	terrible well no and why don't we go back to the original scrap Milo because
8254700	8259140	yeah that's stupid and creepy and we can do we can do the we'll get an adult guy
8259140	8263780	an adult woman and then integrate porn into the games I'm glad that they were
8263780	8266900	able to show off this wonderful tech demo where they can interact with a
8266900	8271540	child and stuff but like if you actually heard about what the game was supposed
8271540	8276060	to be about it was stupid it was just like oh you interact with this child and
8276060	8280340	if you help them find snails because he's moved here from it from isn't that
8280340	8285260	connect animals no no no they make my little okay it's not connect to humans
8285260	8290980	okay it's a child it's a real boy like Pinocchio he wants to be a real boy but
8290980	8296260	he's just digital and you interact with him he helped by snails because he's
8296260	8300900	just so depressed from flying here from I think he was coming from Britain or
8300900	8304140	something like that and somewhere in England flying from England doesn't know
8304140	8309660	anybody and his parents are going through some hard times maybe divorce or
8309660	8315500	something and that's this is way more anger than I was anticipating your Jeff
8315500	8319580	Goldblum voice is just no it's is it's the Peter molyneaux voice that's how he
8319580	8323340	talks going to chat that orange hundred calm salacious pop says damn Loki why
8323340	8328020	you mad though amazed that suma says Loki's British accent sucks it's not a
8328020	8332020	project it's a Peter molyneaux accident oh he talked dark Tetsuya says well I
8332020	8336100	think Loki's British accent beats Rob's I'm not trying to sound British I'm
8336100	8340380	trying to sound like Peter moly no I'm Mel B and today we're going to be talking
8340380	8346940	about fable Rob this bloody old fool bloody old fool she's trying to do also
8346940	8352020	buy my new game L be blah blah blah girl power let's put another girl through
8352020	8359420	patience you know remember when he is pimping out halo or not halo yeah it's
8359420	8365820	pimping out halo Milo in there no no he was pimping out fucking fable to he's
8365820	8372020	like oh no I'm gonna show you something very innovative it's a ball you play you
8372020	8379540	play fetch with the dog with the ball it's like I can fucking do that now with
8379540	8384140	my dog I don't have a dog I can throw a ball at my cat and it's way more
8384140	8388940	entertaining than playing who's like who seriously is gonna go into halo and play
8388940	8393380	fetch your fucking dog for hours on end is this what I'm really paying money for
8393380	8398260	is to play fetch my fucking dog mm-hmm granted it was fun killing people or
8398260	8403380	like torturing them in this little like you know device you can sacrifice real
8403380	8409060	life you can kill people in real life you act like it's impossible it's
8409060	8414860	entirely possible we have salacious pop in chat says that this is Loki right now
8414860	8443940	actually this is Loki right now I apologize that that was very low volume
8443940	8451020	playing YouTube I bet you anything though that fable 3 is going to be very
8451020	8456740	very very very very similar to fable 2 ok dark soccer is finally giving me back
8456740	8460780	my clue DVD it's only been two years since she's had it no Rob it's been
8460780	8464780	longer feels like you have like three movies in here me too I'm gonna watch
8464780	8471940	this when I get home no I'm not I'm gonna play Wow don't joke with us like
8471940	8474980	alright can I do one more story that we can open up the skyline sure alright
8474980	8479820	Nintendo will sue at least that's what they've been doing this week threatening
8479820	8484100	to do they've been threatening Pokemon fan sites who have been posting Pokemon
8484100	8487940	black and white screenshots the game came out in Japan and of course you
8487940	8491060	know folks have been importing it and have been posting screenshots of it on
8491060	8495540	their fan sites but Nintendo has brought down the legal hammer of justice with a
8495540	8498860	cease and desist saying quote while Nintendo appreciates your interest in
8498860	8501940	and support of the Pokemon game series your publication of this content
8501940	8505500	infringes Nintendo's copyrights in violation of federal law your activity
8505500	8508780	also and has the potential caught to cause substantial damage to Nintendo and
8508780	8511980	leaves Nintendo with no choice but to take steps to protect its intellectual
8511980	8517220	property rights some of the sites that were hit poker beach pokey beach I don't
8517220	8523660	know and your beach poker be check up your Pokemon sorry be I don't know if
8523660	8526940	that's one of the names of the Pokemon is Siri be or something and of course
8526940	8531060	they're very upset no and this is awesome because Nintendo is so epically
8531060	8534900	horrible at advertising their own stuff now yes they're going to get pissed off
8534900	8538180	apparently when other people actually try to advertise for them like that's
8538180	8541580	that's amazing it's also kind of disturbing to me that it's like well the
8541580	8545420	game's out somewhere but hold on because there was an update that came out to
8545420	8549380	this that might kind of shed a little light on it and it was you know some
8549380	8553100	various commenters on websites were kind of noticing that the sites that got shut
8553100	8560340	down were admitting to using ROMs to get the screens so maybe the problem wasn't
8560340	8563820	that they were posting screenshots but it's admitting how they did it by
8563820	8568620	getting ROMs of an import game I mean still screenshots are just screenshots
8568620	8571820	and the game is already out but you know if you're gonna go around openly saying
8571820	8576740	I stole the game what if I said you know I wished upon a magic lamp and the gene
8576740	8580980	granted me this copy of the game are they gonna shut down my Pokemon site
8580980	8585740	now well then maybe I don't know I mean I could say that it fell from the sky
8585740	8590380	in a blaze of glory or you just don't say how you got the screenshots at all
8590380	8593900	you just post them I mean isn't that what most websites do but Rob that would
8593900	8598780	be like they get their exclusive report we got the exclusive photoshop those
8598780	8602940	those are photoshop I don't believe that Pokemon has that in there also keep in
8602940	8611180	mind that the DSI pokie shopped version was region locked for for black and
8611180	8615260	white I'm so black and blue is the Pokemon bruise y'all know Shane right
8615260	8617980	yeah on the show a few times he's playing Pokemon black and white right
8617980	8625780	now on his Japanese DS yeah yes it's the or no no it's yeah he's playing it on an

9020620	9026860	fest I went to sweet definitely did you hurt your back from fucking what yeah
9026860	9032340	but you weren't complaining though were you not so what's on your mind caller
9032340	9037660	dude I want a bitch about mad cats okay go ahead they need to stop making
9037660	9041820	controller simple as that what stuff falls apart within like two three months
9041820	9047460	yeah that would suck if I put a pair of um symbols from my drop for my own rock
9047460	9051460	band drum set they stopped working within three months are they pretty
9051460	9056100	cheap though I mean is it like you get what you pay for something like that I
9056100	9059660	mean the current I got him replaced and I use them sparingly and as they're
9059660	9063340	starting to act up a little bit here and there well they have updated them for
9063340	9066500	the rock band three drum set since they actually included with that now and
9066500	9069900	they're supposed to be more sensitive once rock band three out I want to play
9069900	9078380	it so bad makes two more weeks it's like a 16th or some oh wait I'm getting a
9078380	9080980	comment from rice princess here in the background what's that rice princess I
9080980	9087060	was just saying that Rama was a piece of sexual chocolate oh thank you my dear I
9087060	9091700	love you too speaking of a rock band I have to plug the
9091700	9095660	umlaut that's coming up in December it's this thing they do in San Francisco at
9095660	9100780	the DNA lounge where you can actually like you I don't want to say rent the
9100780	9104780	stage but you sort of do like you get to play a song on stage in front of like
9104780	9107780	all the people that are there it's like a concert where you're a band so I'm
9107780	9111860	thinking the doctor and rice princess and I should do a band would it be fun
9111860	9116460	yay I tried to get my friend Victoria to do it but she's kind of being flaky
9116460	9119540	flake on it no I would definitely do that would you yeah oh heck yeah but we
9119540	9124300	have to dress up okay enter grok side yeah what does it dark sakura we need to
9124300	9129180	do it we need a fourth dark sakura what would I do with my bro drums oh you
9129180	9133780	can't do drums oh my god it'll be like I'm fucking monocle all over again you
9133780	9136780	can do interpretive dance
9136780	9154380	Beatles rock band harmony like rock star saying I was just grimacing musically
9154380	9160380	okay good stuff I think this is gonna have to happen what do you think Rama
9160380	9163500	you have to get on stage to see in front of hundreds of people know it what's
9163500	9168180	that I said I'm all for it awesome awesome I have to get over my stage
9168180	9172860	right now you'll be fine just put a paper bag on your head and cut out little
9172860	9178380	like like like in um um guitar hero you can do on guitar freakin um put a
9178380	9184300	bucket of chicken thing on your head it's hard like bucket head there you go
9184300	9189700	no I'm talking I was you know like the little icon guys from guitar freaks
9189700	9194740	you know that game that was made by that could be our band name guitar freaks was
9194740	9200380	first well if you want I give you permission to use my band name what's
9200380	9216540	that rhythm in Jews Rama Jews have no rhythm come on come on I tease because
9216540	9221940	I suggested that I could play with one arm like the drummer for a definitely
9221940	9224940	actually that's an amazing idea because what you should do you should do that
9224940	9226900	whole thing where you put your hand through your shirt so it looks like you
9226900	9232020	don't have an arm awesome because he has a floor pad maybe we can put it on the
9232020	9235340	floor and I can hit it with my feet only if you only if you kick your legs back
9235340	9238540	in a wheelchair it's not like your lieutenant Dan it's it's Halloween time
9238540	9242540	so he she could we go to a Halloween store and get you one of those fake
9242540	9251660	arms always been lobbed off I'll be awesome that's okay it was a good idea
9251660	9255780	at the time I know right we'll just get dark soccer good and drunk before she
9255780	9259820	goes on stage alright drunk I won't be able to say why do I get a drug just
9259820	9263660	bribe her with Guinness that here's the best part guys this doesn't get me they
9263660	9270660	stream loud on the internet so all of you could watch never mind I'll get the
9270660	9276340	recorder ready and it'll be good act F suggests instrument freaks or band
9276340	9282100	freaks which is facts maniacs which is great because there's people from
9282100	9285860	harmonics that actually go to the event and it would be extremely offensive if
9285860	9288020	we named although I don't know if any people are harmonious is they're
9288020	9293140	wonderful people but it would be funny could be freaky guitarists we could be
9293140	9303060	the five seven threes we know we could be the Spice Girls we could dress up as
9303060	9307620	Spice Girls more like the shy girls I get to be Jerry that's all all right

9435720	9441540	out of this no I haven't okay there's this little song and I still remember it

9454860	9459220	el kami nay it was dead Tom B and I still remember this song to this day is
9459220	9464940	pathetic French horrible what did you think didn't have any song what did you
9464940	9471060	think of the verb conjugation song wasn't it awesome oh yeah all right so
9471060	9475820	speaking of video games what's up in video game world yeah video games so
9475820	9481860	interesting oh I wanted to talk about a story to talk about last week about a
9481860	9489140	certain video game side that sells all games ah yes that site that went up and
9489140	9493340	down and then up again oh I think they're still down though because we're
9493340	9500180	definitely not covering the story that they came back I'm aware that they're
9500180	9504740	still down there went my final story of the night oh what would you want to say
9504740	9509900	about the site that shall not be named well not necessarily about the site but
9509900	9517620	about like steam and other sites like I don't remember the other right direct to
9517620	9527780	drive also that sell games the digital distribution distribution well I'm you
9527780	9530380	know it has a lot of people kind of thinking about digital distribution with
9530380	9533540	the website going down it's kind of like a lot of people were giving it second
9533540	9537340	thought like gee is one day all my games just going to suddenly stop working now
9537340	9543540	to be fair I believe the games that the website got me with a pitchfork was
9543540	9549700	selling they were DRM free right and then steam has always said if they ever
9549700	9554060	go down they do have this magic key that will unlock the DRM and all the games
9554060	9557740	and they have like a panic button they can hit they'll automatically make all
9557740	9560620	the games DRM free and I'm surprised hackers haven't found it yet but it must
9560620	9564620	be I think they might have it must be a patch or something I don't know but you
9564620	9572460	know they there is a way out but yeah it's kind of worrying because I have a
9572460	9579140	lot of games I have bought and given to me on steam so I kind of I kind of worry
9579140	9584780	about that where I think it's going to be down someday I think you'll be okay
9584780	9588620	if you read the terms of service for steam it sounds like you'll be okay now
9588620	9591500	here's the one you would worry about honestly if I were you was be that on
9591500	9595580	live as neat as that service is and this scale cool as it looks at the whole
9595580	9598900	streaming game through the internet or whatever when you buy those games you're
9598900	9601900	basically buying the game on someone else's computer and if that service ever
9601900	9607100	goes down you're gonna lose that game now I think they've excuse me they've
9607100	9612340	guaranteed it for what like three years I think but that's you know after that
9612340	9615060	three years you may not have the game anymore which you know after three years
9615060	9617700	you may not want to play the game anymore but I don't know there's some
9617700	9620980	games I want to go back and visit after a long time like the very first
9620980	9625300	civilization I could still play that game it's great and no I didn't place it
9625300	9633780	five this week I'm a bad sieve fan anyhow well good thing on live it's it's
9633780	9637980	I think it's not available in Mexico so I don't have to worry about that
9637980	9644940	hopefully someday as always get last in line I'm sorry yeah all right well any
9644940	9649980	other thoughts before we let you go no that's pretty much it all right you have

9699460	9705100	online with the doctor what's up hey this is entertainment hey what's up
9705100	9710540	what's on your mind I want to bitch about PSN for a second okay right on
9710540	9716460	well I got move and I downloaded a couple demos because I didn't get the
9716460	9725540	$99 package with the demo disk in it okay so I I set this up to download
9725540	9730700	overnight and usually I can go to work or set stuff to download overnight on
9730700	9738260	live and it'll be done when I wake up or get home so I wake up and the thing is
9738260	9746340	and my PlayStation 3 is still on I'm serious it's still trying to download well
9746340	9751940	no it downloaded overnight but it took at least eight hours because I went to
9751940	9757540	sleep about 2 a.m. and left to go see a movie at about 11 and it was still on oh
9757540	9762540	wait what was it you were trying to download just the the patch or seven
9762540	9768020	seven demos for move Wow and none of them were any bigger than about three
9768020	9772300	hundred fifty max it wasn't the same no it wasn't the same day the network went
9772300	9775700	down right it's just it maybe they were just getting hammered I don't know that's
9775700	9780860	so it's kind of freaky you know you can buy full games on PSN can she has like
9780860	9784620	gigs and gigs of data that would just take you hours like you could just go
9784620	9789460	out the door drive to the mall downtown and back in less time than it would take
9789460	9793660	for the stupid game to download digital distribution might not really be the
9793660	9797680	wave of the future just yet it works for the smaller games like on Xbox Live
9797680	9802180	Arcade and you know some of the smaller PSN games but that's crazy I imagine
9802180	9805380	just a bunch of people were hitting it all at once but it's kind of surprising
9805380	9809420	they don't have a better backup system you know for that well a lot of people
9809420	9814780	must be trying to download the heavy rain move patch now because I triggered
9814780	9821940	it to download at about 9 o'clock which is 8 Pacific and it's been about an hour
9821940	9829860	and it says it's 16% complete and it will take 324 minutes left oh that's
9829860	9833900	ridiculous do you have points running I mean maybe your porn torrents are
9833900	9837460	clogging everything that could be the job no the only thing I'm doing right
9837460	9843780	now is I'm calling you on my iPad huh and that's it this is pretty good
9843780	9851220	quality for an iPad I must say huh well I I don't know sir I you could call Sony
9851220	9853900	and complain or you could just bitch about it on internet forums like you're
9853900	9859420	doing now yeah most people are going to be doing I mean what can you do the
9859420	9863380	internet is for yeah exactly it's for bitching anonymously on internet forums
9863380	9867780	about your products yeah anything else you want to complain about while you're
9867780	9874500	on no I was I did finally play some of the demos and they're really good the
9874500	9880540	tumble demo is really nice mm-hmm and so is ruse which is kind of what I've
9880540	9887140	always wanted from wiimote from out of the week do you think it's do you think
9887140	9893380	that this the PlayStation might have a serious competitor here to the Wii I
9893380	9898900	don't know it all depends on the games right right but it sounds like you were
9898900	9903980	enjoying a couple of these demos yeah the ruse demo is kind of this
9903980	9910260	militaristic strategy game which I might have to pick that up when it finally
9910260	9915500	comes out I don't know I still haven't got the move myself yet maybe maybe at
9915500	9918260	some point or I'll just go over to Loki and play his that sounds like an even
9918260	9922820	better idea right Loki yeah all right I haven't even played mine yet any other
9922820	9927140	last thoughts before we let you go that's about it all right just don't
9927140	9930060	forget to turn off the port hopefully someday I will be able to play heavy
9930060	9935940	rain with move all right well let us know maybe next week and maybe it might

9972740	9977400	have a chest cold bro voice ah dude I love the bro voice yeah I'm gonna go put
9977400	9984780	on like a Dave Matthews band CD and put on a visor sideways like a great visual
9984780	9990200	yeah keep talking keep talking I was calling about Ronda's comment that mad
9990200	9994420	cats really just needs to stop making controllers okay I have a little story
9994420	9999380	about that awesome I used I bought one of their like eight
9999380	10004780	and one memory sticks for the Dreamcast where it has a switch on it it died
10004780	10008780	after like a month it deleted all my saves no I love that it not only died
10008780	10013220	but it deleted them that's that's amazing yeah and then since he was
10013220	10020180	talking about controllers I bought a Blanca six button the fighting pad for
10020180	10025580	the 360 when Street Fighter 4 came out and I got it off I think eBay it was
10025580	10028740	brand new it was in like the horrible clamshell where you need like a box
10028740	10033660	cutter and a living sacrifice to get the fuck it's open and meanwhile you break
10033660	10037540	the product is you're opening yeah yeah it didn't work like it was just dead out
10037540	10041320	of the box the 360 was like I don't know what the fuck you just connected to me
10041320	10045860	but this is doubt it get that get this away from me so I said like 40 bucks on
10045860	10050220	a mad cat's controller that was just dead like that's awesome so they need to
10050220	10056100	stop very good yeah I agree with all those stories I would probably buy one
10056100	10062920	just to you know step on it and kick the grass room I can hear Rob giggling hi hi
10062920	10069020	feel better fine also since you guys are talking about the Tomb Raider reboot I
10069020	10072980	really think that no one Kerr about Lara Croft anymore and that they need to put
10072980	10076700	that franchise to bed because there are so many bad games associated with that
10076700	10080940	hold on you enjoyed that Lara Croft in the guardian light game as much as I did
10080940	10085180	unless you were lying for my benefit no see that's the thing that's an awesome
10085180	10090180	game no it is but because it has Lara Croft and Tomb Raider attached to it
10090180	10094100	like that's the brand people are gonna go oh you know what's this shit and
10094100	10098500	they're not gonna buy it I think that's what if if that co-op game was put under
10098500	10102180	a new IP with new characters people would go oh this is a great game because
10102180	10107900	it is but just the Tomb Raider games for the ps2 were awful three four five for
10107900	10114100	the ps1 were awful so I just feel that this kind of box office poison like I
10114100	10117980	don't know she's Lara Croft is Lara Croft is the M night Shyamalan of video
10117980	10122060	games you pretty much like they just they don't care you know she was genre
10122060	10127420	breaking in 96 with her you know platforming and her bad pyramid tips but
10127420	10133700	now no one cares no wonder no one care about Lara Croft which is which is a
10133700	10137260	shame because I think that you know I'd often still put out good games with her
10137260	10141660	it's just that she as an icon is bringing their ideas down I don't know
10141660	10146740	do you think maybe they got one more chance like maybe this reboot if it's
10146740	10151140	really good maybe people can look past it and forgive or no it's over put it
10151140	10155140	pasture didn't I thought the game the adventure game that they put out for her
10155140	10159500	last year or the year before I think it's for the ps3 was also supposed to
10159500	10163900	be really good but like again I've never really heard of that like once it came
10163900	10169000	out no one cared and it never really broke any sales charts so I think it may
10169000	10172220	just be a done deal I guess with the reboot if they'd have to put a lot of
10172220	10176060	money into marketing it to say like no really guys this was actually good or
10176060	10180540	just put the topless patch in honestly and then boys everywhere want to play
10180540	10184340	right just just release it on PC in the skidding community will take care of
10184340	10188060	that for them there you go all right anything else you want to share with the
10188060	10193700	listeners nope that's it I managed to stave off having a coffee fit for a good
10193700	10197540	two minutes so I think now's a good time to leave okay feel better better get
10197540	10201180	better or Disneyland so I can spin you around in a teacup yay I'll throw up on

10235380	10239020	yeah how do you smell that all the way from where you're at that's kind of
10239020	10244700	that's a little bit freaky I don't know you know so did you have any other last
10244700	10251620	minute stories Loki each you want to get to sure hold on we get more calls now
10251620	10255860	it's lighting up like crazy let's get to another call doctor you ready yep thank
10255860	10258660	you for calling orange lounge radio you're online with the doctor what's up
10258660	10266140	hey what's up suppose what's that I'm on with the doctor you're on with the
10266140	10269940	doctor I'm the doctor is there any aliens I need to be worrying about them
10269940	10273540	ah there's tons of aliens dude I got my son a screwdriver and I'm ready to go
10273540	10279940	oh shit I gotta run we better because there is an awful lot of running so we
10279940	10287100	definitely need to do that so besides the aliens what's going on tonight with
10287100	10292020	you wait who is that hi who is this this is zappy hi zappy how are you
10292020	10296740	I'm pretty good okay I'll let's talk to doctor yet okay well the reason was
10296740	10300260	talking good call in was because it's sort of related to what rare team was
10300260	10306140	talking about before is because I have a copy of ruse but for the Xbox 360 and
10306140	10313580	let me tell you that controller is in isn't cutting it like it's I can see
10313580	10318140	it's a really good game but you're just being held back by the horrible horrible
10318140	10326460	controls like I select my units and always picking the wrong ones and it's
10326460	10330340	just not working I could see that because that's a lot of games in game
10330340	10335260	room are kind of like that a lot of Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 kind of
10335260	10339980	made me think that because it was just so awful to try and control but it's
10339980	10344820	kind of a bummer that that controller really ruins some games and what pisses
10344820	10348300	me off is because I didn't know that they're gonna have a PlayStation move
10348300	10352220	and that would probably work a lot better than trying to you know it's
10352220	10357100	basically like having a big anchor and being thrown off the side of the boat
10357100	10361860	you're kind of being dragged down to the bottom the ocean there well now what do
10361860	10364180	you think though about this new Xbox 360 controller they're supposed to be
10364180	10367380	putting out that has the whole like yeah you just twist it and then it's like a
10367380	10373020	different d-pad it looks like a big gimmick to charge me $65 isn't that
10373020	10376220	terrible that they're only bound bundling it with that dumb play in
10376220	10380860	charge or whatever it is like oh it's so annoying how they do this just like it's
10380860	10386000	just like Nintendo doing that new Nintendo remote with Wii Plus or
10386000	10391500	whatever with a crappy tennis knockoff game I mean really that's yeah but at
10391500	10397500	least the Wii Sports Resort was at least you know fun that's true I don't know I
10397500	10400060	didn't play a lot of that very seriously because I kind of gave up on the way I
10400060	10403540	haven't had my Wii plugged in and like over a year which is really sad because
10403540	10407180	I wanted to play Metroid but I just I can't bring myself to hook up the new
10407180	10413620	Nintendo Wii. God dammit you're lazy. Somewhere deep in Nintendo America's headquarters, Reggie is amazed crying himself to sleep after that.
10413620	10417420	but the problem is like I have heard nothing but bad things about the new
10417420	10420100	Metroid and it's making me a little weird well I've heard a few good things
10420100	10423660	here and there but I'm a little scared because like Super Metroid is like the
10423660	10428460	Holy Grail of video games to me and oh yeah I love Super Metroid and if they
10428460	10434100	botched it like I'm I'm really really sad like my experience with new Metroid
10434100	10440040	was about five minutes at Best Buy and it seemed okay but I have five minutes I
10440040	10445180	can't really say here or there could be good just wouldn't kind of made me
10445180	10449420	honest yeah you can't base an entire review of a game off of just five
10449420	10453460	minutes you know cuz I'm sure everybody at E3 loved it you know the lines to play
10453460	10458140	that game at E3 were like hours long it was almost as long as the 3ds line at
10458140	10461460	some points because it was moving a little slower really it's not like I
10461460	10464820	guess the people who couldn't get into the 3ds line said okay I'll sell from
10464820	10469900	Metroid yes yes maybe not hours but like at least an hour it's crazy how long
10469900	10472980	lines get there that reminds me I'm getting my wallet ready this week to
10472980	10478940	find out how much they'll be raping me out of my wallet for the 3ds oh is that
10478940	10483420	are they announcing a date this week well I'm hearing there and finally
10483420	10486500	announced it like in the middle of this week I think was Wednesday that's right
10486500	10490460	because Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo game show right but they always do their own
10490460	10495460	little kind of like spin-off right they do their own little fan event around the
10495460	10499460	same time so that makes sense so I'm kind of like basically unless they're
10499460	10502300	like charging a thousand bucks they basically got me locked down for that
10502300	10509100	thing I gonna say it's probably gonna be 249 and it's gonna come with a like
10509100	10513020	either I think it'll be like kind of like a tech demo II type of game that's
10513020	10515660	just a bunch of like the movie trailers and some of the tech demos they were
10515660	10522060	showing it on 3ds and then like ocarina of time in 3d or some old-ass Nintendo
10522060	10526420	IP that they can just easily do as the pack in the game well they got me at
10526420	10530620	launch for DS and I bought the PSP within three months of launch so I'm
10530620	10533140	pretty sure I'm gonna pick this up do you regret buying either of those
10533140	10540680	systems maybe the PSP a little bit you know the DS I had been having like as a
10540680	10544420	paperweight for the last six months there really hasn't been anything coming
10544420	10548540	out this year for it no yeah they didn't really show a lot of d3 either because
10548540	10551620	there it's all about the 3ds now you know and except for the little girl
10551620	10554620	games like fancy Nancy yeah that's like the only thing that seems interesting
10554620	10558420	coming out is maybe Pokemon in black and white well that's true that's gonna be a
10558420	10565860	big deal when it comes out well otherwise I just don't see my fancy all
10565860	10569140	right well zappy any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go
10569140	10575660	tonight um don't buy ruse on the 360 the PC is probably the best choice and maybe
10575660	10580660	the PlayStation move version all right word of warning of caution to the
10580660	10584260	listeners all right you have a good one zappy thanks for the call later later

10634620	10638140	know if this is mentioned before because I've been paying a lot of attention
10638140	10642340	plants versus zombies is now becoming a quest in World of Warcraft
10642340	10647140	capitalism mm-hmm so that's pretty awesome peace bloom versus ghouls or
