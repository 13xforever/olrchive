100330	103891	I like that you're psychic to the point where you can't remember your own name
125678	126138	It was dumb.
126178	127699	Like, even repeating the story is really dumb.
127719	129019	Wouldn't that mean I have ESPN?
129059	131040	That's because you're psycho and have ESPN.
131360	132801	This is really, really dumb.
133001	133541	For real.
134041	134761	For real, real.

154789	156370	No, I really don't, but thank you.
156870	157570	I like you too.
157850	163032	Ranma says, I thought tonight was a repeat as many times as Jamie said crunchy, lol.
163072	166814	No, it's we're live here on this lovely September evening of 2008.
166974	167874	No, I'm kidding.
168155	168455	All right.
170516	170896	All right.
171716	183384	It's 2010 of course, we're live and we're going to talk about all the latest and greatest in video games and all that But of course we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of How was your gaming week, DarkSakura, CrunchyTheBagelQueen?
183704	185266	How was your gaming week?
185586	198575	I love Plants vs. Zombies a lot Like, I was supposed to go to bed at midnight a couple nights ago I was going to Apple Hill on the weekend Okay, your mic is full of fail, you gotta grab it Okay, I got it Alright, starting over
199963	203405	I had to go to bed early one night because we were going to Apple Hill the next day.
204126	205047	Which is awesome.
205807	206888	It has lots of apple juice.
207789	208869	Apple Hill's awesome?
209550	209770	Yes.
213012	213372	Anyway.
215274	222439	But instead of going to bed on time when I was supposed to, I was up for three hours playing Plants vs. Zombies and didn't even realize how late I was up playing Plants vs. Zombies.
223119	224140	And I did it again yesterday.
224841	225441	And I love that game.
225781	227783	Plants vs. Zombies is freaking rad.
228083	229424	And then I played some Final Fantasy XIII.
231708	233354	How many times can this dude say hero?
234380	245485	For those of our listeners that aren't local to the Sacramento area, Apple Hill is a place a little bit up, I guess, a little eastern from us.
246386	247426	It's Camino, California.
247486	253569	Up the hill, I guess, if you will, where they have a lot of apples and crafts and stuff.
254349	261753	I mean, the apple cider is awesome, but apple cider is awesome all the time, but it's crafts.
262597	263418	Thanks for watching!
282608	283369	Swamp Hill.
284029	284729	They've got crap.
284769	295792	One thing that Apple does have going for it is there was a place there that had a really good lamb burger of which I got lamb burger juice all over my hands and wiped it off on a lamb.
295992	298073	Is there a lamb burglar there?
298093	298653	That is sick.
299013	300933	PETA's going to be calling any minute now.
301654	302654	Here's your sister.
302774	303474	Come here.
303694	304974	That's gross.
305014	310576	For the record, I went shopping at the organic market up there and
311036	321019	I picked Heirloom Tomatoes Fell down the hill My knee looks better than it did You took a tumble down Apple Hill Did it shake you to your core?
321459	337503	No, no, I'm leaving This was the awesome part When I fell on my knees I really bruised up my knee really bad But I did not tear my jeans So you were a bruised Apple Hill I'll be here all night everybody Don't forget to tip your waitress
342236	342536	Okay.
343477	343757	Indeed.
344558	344818	So.
345698	350622	I love how your gaming week is like, yeah, I play Planet vs. Zombies and a little more Final Fantasy XIII and oh my god, apples.
350742	351923	Apples, apples, apples, apples, apples.
352463	353524	And I'm not talking Max.
353544	354404	I got fudge.
356506	356626	Oh.
356866	357566	Congrats.
357807	360068	They do have an apple cider milkshake that's pretty good though.
360709	362550	That's where we have lunch.
362850	365112	We had lunch at the place that had the apple milkshakes.
365172	365752	It was so good.
365792	367893	Video games are pretty good.
367934	371056	Let's go to Apple Hill and pack some fudge just like Crunchy the Bagel Queen.
371076	371376	Whoa.
371816	373797	We don't need to go to Apple Hill to do that.
374277	374657	All right.
374777	375137	All right.
375197	375998	You guys have earned it.
376058	376378	Hold on.
379779	382340	What I love is that your mic is so crappy it won't pick that thing up anymore.
382360	382880	You know what?
382940	383541	All right.
383781	384841	My mic is not crappy.
384881	385521	It's the cord that's crappy.
385581	386502	I should bring the swear bear in.
387902	388823	You have a swear bear?
388843	389663	I have a swear bear.
389723	390343	At my desk.
390363	391584	What is a swear bear?
391604	394985	It's a bear that makes really obscene comments.
395245	396366	It's what it sounds like, Rob.
396486	398107	It has two different settings on the back of it.
398127	407291	It has a switch, which I thought was an on-off switch, and for the longest time kept saying, kiss my ass, instead of all the wonderful things he normally says.
407612	413275	But he'll say, of course, kiss my ass, and he'll say, eat shit and die, motherfucker.
414615	417457	But I have it on my desk, and it's a really cute-looking bear.
417517	422599	It says, hug me, or press me in its chest, and some people are like, oh, it's a bear!
422619	423120	Yeah.
423900	425922	What the fuck did they just say to me?
426643	429105	I know, seriously, why do we not have a swear bear here in the studio?
429225	430446	I will bring it in next week.
430526	433448	Well, I'm not going to be here next week, so I think that's too bad.
433468	435770	Why don't you have the swear bear sit in for me next week?
435790	436831	I miss the ferret, Rob.
437232	437672	I'm sorry.
438353	438713	I ate it.
438993	441516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
457313	458795	I can't help it, it's so addicting.
461217	464661	But yeah, it's an awesome game, so you should get it really on any platform that you can.
466604	468886	Then also, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.
469587	471709	And that was pretty much it.
472730	473571	I don't know, it's fun.
473611	477195	We went back, like I said, to the Lost and Damned expansion.
478937	485459	I kind of missed the old open world actual death matches and stuff instead of being confined to a really small portion of the map.
485899	486899	So it's kind of nice to do that.
488259	492640	We're going to be modding it again soon, so I'll be back to the incredible games that we used to play.
494661	500082	And then, since she brought up something completely unrelated to games, I thought I'd bring something up that...
500540	501521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
521713	523755	It didn't break at any point?
523815	524796	No, different carrots.
525016	527218	He shoved one through a guy's throat.
527298	529139	He stabbed a person in the eye with a carrot.
529619	534844	It was just... The movie, from the beginning, was just so over the top.
534864	535784	What the fuck movie is this?
536465	539568	It's with... Oh, what the fuck is his name?
540708	542750	That actor that nobody knows.
543791	544211	I don't know.
544452	545292	Yeah, I can't think of any.
545312	547234	That guy who did that thing in that place.
548641	553663	Yeah, but no, it's a really, really just over-the-top movie.
553723	560027	Like, they spend, like, two minutes where it's just kind of okay, normal, and then it's just like, boom, all action, just all the time.
560047	562168	Like, over-the-top, gratuitous.
562688	565929	They're having sex in a gunfight at the same time.
566169	566690	I mean, there's...
568290	573532	There's parts where he is... He was doing something with a baby.
574373	580835	Shoot Em Up is a 2007 action film starring Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Bellucci.
580855	582155	She was the hot chick in The Matrix, huh?
582395	584076	And she was the hot chick in that movie, too.
585637	588818	She was a lactating prostitute that he brought the baby to feed.
590198	592419	Wow, sounds like a real family fun film.
592859	593820	No, it's awesome, though.
593920	596463	Seriously, it is, like, such an awesome movie.
596783	600968	And I do idolize the fact that he killed people that annoyed him.
601068	602429	Like, he's all, you know my pet peeve?
602449	610338	Like, there's, like, one part after a gunfight, they're, like, getting away from these bad guys, and this guy cuts them off without, you know, he merged lanes without signaling.
610638	613401	So he chased the guy down, slammed him off the road, and then, you know,
614482	616505	I could have swore that Loki said let's talk about actual video games this week.
632206	632766	I did!
632786	657548	This is his Apple Hill moment, just give it to him, Rob No, seriously, I mean, I totally missed this when it came out in theaters but, you know, on DVD and Blu-ray and stuff like that until it was on cable TV No, seriously, it's such an awesome movie, just way over the top I don't understand why it didn't do better than it did in the box office because it was just such a crazy movie
657808	662936	If I'm understanding this correctly, he's killing anyone that even slightly annoys him.
664619	667985	There's no anger issues at all in this movie.
669276	680558	Not everybody, but usually it's like, I don't know, lots of funny one-liners in there and just really ridiculous stuff.
680918	685419	At one point he gets both of his thumbs broken and he's firing the gun in really weird ways.
685639	687100	He uses the carrot a lot.
687400	688700	He uses the carrot to fire the gun.
689040	694121	He jams a carrot into the trigger of an Uzi and throws the Uzi at the bad guys and
695317	696659	It's just so ridiculous.
696739	706989	There's one scene in the warehouse where he rigs this elaborate pulley system with all these guns and they're coming after him and he's watching them on security cameras and firing different guns in remote places.
707089	708631	It's just ridiculous.
708671	710813	But it would make such an awesome video game.
711714	712955	And that's how we bring it back.
713696	714536	And this is called again?
715057	715417	Shoot Em Up.
715437	715758	Shoot Em Up.
716458	718780	That sounds like a lot of video games.
719060	724065	No, seriously, I think it was one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.
724105	731671	I mean, I think it even surpasses Wanted for me, because Wanted I thought was a pretty awesome action movie, but this is just ridiculous.
731711	733993	This is like big hit ridiculous and then some.
734513	735835	I love the big hit.
736936	738036	Oh, that movie is ridiculous.
738056	738137	Okay.
738877	739358	Alright, wow.
739378	740339	Back to shoot-em-up radio.
741500	742521	I have a torrent ready.
742901	743121	Okay.
743181	747365	I mean, I have a YouTube clips of it ready.
747385	747766	Of course.
748746	749908	My gaming week.
750008	752110	Today I actually played Plants vs. Zombies.
752210	753151	I'm not even kidding.
753191	754172	I played for like five minutes.
754192	755072	Is there an echo in the room?
755573	755753	Yeah.
756794	757835	Other games I played this week.
757895	764021	I played a little more of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light because I hadn't really played it since the week it came out and I was like, oh, I want to
764541	766284	and beat more of it because it's such a cool game.
766304	767446	So I wanted to play more of that, so I did.
769790	770451	What's that, DarkSakura?
770471	771753	Sorry, I remembered another game I played.
772254	774017	Is she just going to cut me off for your game?
774077	774698	I see how it is.
774718	776080	Well, you made me think about it wrong.
776100	776561	Fine, what?
776761	777162	Droplets.
777883	778324	The hell's that?
778800	780822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
795296	799057	You should think about fitting Earthbound into there somewhere, Rob.
799137	799777	At some point.
800098	800258	Yes.
800298	800538	I know.
800738	803199	You're a little behind like many years.
804599	805099	And let's see.
805159	807660	I played World of Warcraft a lot because it's awesome.
807680	807980	Shut up.
808020	808580	You played too.
808740	808981	Shut up.
809021	809381	You too.
810281	811901	And then I did play something new.
812001	816643	I played Need for Speed World, which is the free MMO because it's free.
816703	817603	It's an MMO?
817763	820284	It's a free Need for Speed MMO.
820624	822305	It came out on the show a couple of weeks ago.
822505	822685	Okay.
822705	823546	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
851585	865459	It's pretty much like that, but it's kind of such a clusterfuck that I guess around a race or something, there's no collision detection because seriously, there'll be like 20 cars piled up where all the cars happen to start.
866079	868381	So it looks kind of funny with all these names.
868742	871144	So I didn't really get the MMO part of it.
871404	872786	The cops are very dumb in that game.
873186	873907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
892103	895425	Talk bad about a free game because it actually was pretty decent.
895445	900107	The only free games I can think of that I can talk bad about are Yaris, of course, Totem Ball.
900207	900908	That was really bad.
901288	902428	I mean, there's only a handful.
903369	907471	But this is worth your time to look, especially if you're a fan of racing games or you need free speed.
907551	911513	It plays a lot like one of the Xbox games that I've played in the past.
912013	912634	Oh.
913054	913194	Yeah.
913334	913634	Why not?
914315	914815	Check that out.
916116	917678	Other than that, not a whole lot.
917698	920740	I was playing some new iPhone games because who doesn't love iPhone games?
921601	922482	The Game Center games.
922502	928127	There's a game in there called Word Challenge and I was a little scared at first because it's by Zynga.
928766	930528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
946932	947813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
967327	967787	I guess.
967988	968348	I don't know.
968668	969969	I could go in and look up some obscure words.
970009	972151	They have that one game that's on the App Store now.
972251	981318	It's like some pirate version of Scrabble where all the words are like R. Okay, there's only so many words you can do in pirate speak.
981518	983880	Like R and then R.
984800	985961	No, but that's literally what it was.
986221	987382	Yeah, it was literally that.
987463	990385	I mean, it was kind of a joke for Talk Like a Pirate Day or whatever.
990525	991706	Oh, I see.
991866	994308	How do you know that?
994328	994589	Let's see.
994629	998051	I'm actually launching the game right now so I can read some of the obscure words.
998071	1002215	I'm going into the challenges because X-Link dared to send me some challenges.
1003016	1003796	And I whooped them.
1004697	1005978	Of course, because it's X-Link.
1005998	1006338	Let's see.
1006398	1010682	What are some of the... Wagerers, Eagerer...
1012564	1016630	Let me look at some of the, like, these aren't words you think of, like, as you're playing these games.
1016850	1018112	Let me look at some of the, like... Did they say eager?
1018192	1018592	Eager.
1020834	1021815	That's not a word!
1021915	1023356	It is a word, according to this game.
1023376	1024077	It's bad English.
1024157	1025518	It's like, more eager.
1025759	1027220	T-W-A-E.
1027640	1028101	Tway.
1028361	1029682	I've never heard that word before.
1029722	1031024	I thought you were going to spell twat.
1031424	1032305	I was going to spell twat.
1032505	1033426	T-W-A-E.
1033486	1033826	Tway?
1033846	1035968	Tway, did you say?
1036188	1040913	I see tire, and I see twas, and I get those, like twas the night before Christmas, but tway?
1041213	1041814	I've never heard of that.
1042134	1045297	And I almost said twig, but I know what a twig is.
1046818	1047479	What's that?
1047779	1048641	What's a VIGA?
1048802	1049764	V-I-G-A.
1050064	1050485	VIGA.
1050686	1051147	VIGA?
1051267	1051708	I don't know.
1052049	1053673	That sounds dirty.
1054955	1055437	A VIGA.
1055871	1059593	I think it's like, it sounds like part of a word, like vegetable.
1059634	1060494	VEGA, like vagina?
1060634	1062075	Okay, the definition of VEGA.
1062635	1068479	One of the heavy rafters and especially a log supporting the roof of an American Indian or Spanish architecture of the Southwest.
1068499	1071701	Because I fucking know Spanish architecture in the Midwest.
1071782	1072302	Jesus.
1072322	1073963	Don't you feel sheepish now?
1074223	1074523	I do.
1074543	1075564	You don't know that word.
1075904	1076284	All right.
1076305	1078966	If only you were more eager.
1081648	1084070	And TWA is the Scottish variant of TOO.
1085201	1087862	Oh, some fucking Scottish words are in the game?
1088142	1088762	I guess.
1088782	1090943	That word would be banned in Scrabble, just saying.
1091703	1101025	Alright, so anyway, that's my one problem with this game is that you could just drag your finger around the board and connect three letters and as long as there's a vowel, you'll probably have a word.
1102746	1105807	In fact, you might be able to make a word out of nothing but vowels, actually.
1111162	1113545	Alright, how about our guests?
1113585	1114447	How was your gaming week?
1114947	1115608	The Doctor?
1115808	1123219	Well, much like Rice Princess, I only own a Nintendo Wii So Nintendo of America, I haven't been playing video games at all
1125660	1127621	What have you been doing in real life?
1127661	1128962	Did you go to Apple Hill or anything?
1128982	1134144	I went... I did, and I ate Captain Picard.
1134184	1134564	What?
1136125	1137786	Bryce Prince is just showing me Captain Picard.
1139547	1141448	Captain Picard and I went to Apple Hill, apparently.
1142728	1144929	And we ate lots of apples and had sex.
1145790	1146690	All right, don't make things up.
1147071	1151513	You should make a drink that's themed after, you know, Star Trek and call it Picard-y.
1151813	1151993	Yeah.
1153766	1154868	That's not ridiculous.
1155248	1161696	Salacious Pop in our chat room says, Aviga is a little vajay from Italy that hipsters ride around on.
1162297	1164841	Oh, God.
1164901	1166763	It's sad that I understand that joke.
1166923	1167244	All right.
1167905	1171970	Rice Princess, I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week, but I thought I'd try anyway.
1172682	1175203	I played homework for the PC.
1176024	1176524	Did you?
1176884	1178445	And insomnia for the bed.
1180546	1181887	And that's about it.
1182347	1183488	That's my game in week.
1183928	1184609	Full of action.
1184689	1188851	You need to get a little like one of those like books to read in bed.
1189211	1190052	Thanks for watching!
1214654	1215895	Rub it in my face.
1216336	1217016	Aw, loves you.
1217056	1220519	Well, you can just take junk mail, staple it together, and pretend it's a book.
1220599	1222461	Hey, I have books.
1222501	1225543	I have to buy, like, $500 books for school.
1225603	1226704	I should probably read them.
1227625	1230748	No book should be $500 nowadays.
1230988	1231908	I realize that.
1232029	1233009	You realize that.
1233170	1238694	But publishing companies are like, well, we can't make money on the books, so we have to keep re-releasing the same crap and charge $500.
1239815	1244879	Well, and plus they're not giving a discount on the iBooks and stuff now, which I think is ridiculous for schools.
1246260	1248982	Well, I prefer like paper books anyway, so.
1249987	1254531	It seems to me, though, that they should be giving, since they're not distributing the paper, they should give a discount on iBooks and stuff.
1254651	1256492	Some of the books end up being cheaper anyway, though.
1257093	1265619	I've gotten a few through Amazon that are, just end up being something like maybe $30 cheaper than buying a full textbook.
1265719	1266820	For the Kindle or whatever?
1266840	1268441	Well, I use the Kindle app on my iPhone.
1269782	1274446	So, then it's a lot better than bringing a whole big book with me.
1275487	1279250	I actually bought a book in iBooks this week on the iPhone.
1279870	1280952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1294990	1295711	Okay, okay.
1314930	1317432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1340291	1341171	So, good luck.
1341191	1342212	Suckers.
1343232	1343452	Alright.
1344232	1345753	So enjoy next week's show while I'm not here.
1346913	1347953	Also join us on Facebook.
1347973	1352795	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Twitter.com slash OLR is where you can find us on Twitter.
1353255	1353675	Lots of fun.
1354795	1356656	Any housekeeping you want to add?
1357016	1357296	No.
1357616	1360036	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
1360217	1361637	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
1362057	1366964	Apparently, IGM claims to have received technical specs for the Nintendo 3DS.
1367145	1369228	The Nintendo DS.
1369268	1370289	We know what's in it now.
1372452	1373594	Years after it's come out.
1377393	1377873	Let's see.
1377953	1385116	Apparently, the handheld system will be using the DMP PICA 200 GPU.
1385837	1386937	Wow, that's impressive.
1387237	1388038	Except I don't know what it is.
1389258	1391960	Running at a slowed down 166 MHz along with two ARM11 CPUs running at 266 MHz.
1391980	1392920	That's a lot of MHz, right?
1392940	1392980	No?
1393000	1393400	Of course not.
1401645	1419683	which of course it doesn't seem to back the rumor that it was running the Nvidia Tegra chips and it says according to IGN as well they will also have a looks like a gig and a half of flash memory for storage much like the DSi's do now except a little bit more
1422084	1428606	Apparently, numerous developers are working on software for the platform, obviously, since they showed out a bunch of stuff at E3 anyways.
1430187	1440191	And said that they've likened the graphical capabilities to current generation consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, albeit on smaller, lower resolution screens.
1441691	1443232	But that's kind of neat.
1443852	1446833	And apparently, I guess, it's only going to have 64 megs of RAM.
1448891	1449512	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1468598	1469940	Do the cartridges not have it on there?
1472564	1473104	No, they don't.
1473365	1474667	But, see, that's the other thing.
1474727	1476510	I don't understand why you couldn't do that.
1476570	1479394	Say, for example, have more RAM on the cartridge or something.
1482338	1482699	I don't know.
1483019	1483120	It's...
1484701	1485181	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1501613	1502333	Thanks for watching!
1522923	1525244	Don't skimp on important stuff like that.
1525324	1536870	But I guess their reasoning behind it is that, first off, the 3DS doesn't have an iOS or some sort of operating system to hog resources.
1537730	1541852	And also because it's low resolution, it's not going to use as much RAM.
1543553	1546154	Does it explain how the 3D without glasses works, though?
1547546	1553110	3D Without Glasses, it's basically like... We talked about that like six months ago.
1553210	1555151	Somebody should have been listening.
1555852	1562736	No, it works very much like those... Of course, I can't remember what they're called now.
1563637	1568820	Have you seen those, for example, kind of little hologram things that they have?
1568900	1569441	Lenticular.
1569461	1574564	It's like a lenticular page or something like that.
1575240	1582125	where basically there's lenses in there that force half the image into one eye and half the image into the other eye and it makes it seem like it's popping out.
1582646	1585628	Or not necessarily popping out, but going back in.
1585728	1586468	It gives it depth.
1587449	1588170	So that's how it works.
1590231	1595275	There's actually a person standing behind the DS and holding stuff in front of your face.
1595635	1598737	Tiny, tiny digital midget is how it's done.
1601179	1603761	So there will be plenty of sex games on the 3DS then.
1605017	1605398	What?
1606959	1607720	I would assume so, yes.
1608161	1609302	It's powered by the Force.
1610804	1611125	Whoa.
1615021	1620105	Alright, I don't know what powers this game, but there's going to be apparently a reboot rumored of Tomb Raider.
1620505	1627469	This has been rumored for some time, and it's kind of a duh, because Tomb Raider... It's been rebooted how many times now?
1627529	1628310	I don't know.
1628830	1632553	Wasn't the last one a reboot, and then the last one before that a reboot?
1632673	1633594	I guess, I don't know.
1634114	1639057	And then this Lara Croft game was also kind of a reboot, but it was more like, let's go this way with it.
1639137	1641239	Let's make kind of a different game with the same character.
1642099	1642680	It's kind of different.
1642760	1644721	Yeah, it's worked well all those times.
1645421	1647442	Well, actually, some of them weren't bad.
1648102	1654324	And this most recent one, the Lara Croft game, is the most interesting one I think I've played since the first two on the PC years ago.
1654424	1658105	But if they got it right, then they wouldn't be rebooting it every few years.
1658285	1660606	Well, I think there's supposed to be different franchises.
1660826	1670169	Like, I think there's going to be new Lara Croft games for arcade download, and then the DVD Blu-ray games will be these, this reboot or whatever that's been rumored for some time.
1671249	1696782	and in an interview with I'm sorry not an interview but a report from Eurogamer apparently says the latest issue of PC Gamer I guess I get their eyes on it first says that the new Tomb Raider is indeed happening it's supposed to be set on a Japanese island and it will offer Laura in an open world it's a quote cohesive level with multiple ways around the puzzles so it's one giant level I guess is how this game is supposed to work Supercroft 64
1697662	1698283	Something like that.
1699023	1703247	They're going to say that Laura is, quote, younger and inexperienced in the ways of raiding tombs.
1704649	1705349	I love that quote.
1705630	1707712	She's inexperienced in raiding tombs.
1708732	1710614	She just needs a strong man to share the ways.
1710694	1717321	They're guessing holiday 2011 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
1717421	1718642	Notice how I left out the we.
1719042	1720243	As long as you can lock everybody.
1720263	1722284	Butler in the freezer, I'll be happy.
1723365	1725306	She looks so mad in that picture, by the way.
1725346	1726587	That little picture, yeah.
1727908	1741478	You know, obviously, I really like the game that was on Xbox, the download that's coming out on the other platforms really soon, so if that's kind of the direction they're going with it, I'm all for it, although it's not supposed to be that.
1741498	1744800	They've said it's going to be a completely different kind of game, I guess more like the original, but...
1745260	1745580	I don't know.
1745980	1752881	Like, the latest game on the arcade kind of has me excited about Lara Croft again, so this could be good.
1753522	1757022	I liked back when the early rumors were suggesting it was more of a survival horror game.
1757062	1759263	Like, if that's true, I think that's awesome.
1759363	1760823	That doesn't even make sense, though.
1760863	1765124	How is there a segue between Tomb Raider and then Haunted Tomb?
1765204	1766304	Did you ever see The Descent?
1766944	1767724	The movie The Descent?
1767804	1768364	I did see The Descent.
1768384	1771525	Where it's all the chicks in the cave, and it's like one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.
1771545	1771785	Really?
1772565	1774786	That would be so corny.
1774946	1775647	Oh, come on.
1775667	1779249	That would be so forced.
1779389	1779949	Come on.
1780229	1782290	I don't think I've ever seen a scarier movie than The Descent.
1782350	1783471	Are you kidding me?
1784151	1784892	You're a pussy.
1784952	1786653	I'm sorry, but The Descent was not that.
1786673	1787193	No, you!
1787533	1788133	No, you!
1788153	1790735	It was not...
1791440	1792722	Why are you mad though?
1792742	1793643	I ain't mad.
1793663	1794984	I ain't mad at you girl.
1795805	1798548	But it wasn't that scary.
1798588	1799769	Yes it was.
1799970	1801391	I sat there the whole time.
1801611	1804575	I've seen much scarier movies than that.
1804915	1806577	Like the Care Bears movie.
1807057	1808759	That shit was scary man.
1809120	1809580	Pokemon 3.
1810948	1811488	Yeah!
1811689	1812229	Assholes.
1812269	1813189	You're assholes.
1813750	1814150	Shut up.
1814170	1817972	You talk about scary movies in, like, you know, caverns or something like that.
1818232	1819593	Fraggle Rock, the movie.
1820533	1822194	Rob, did that movie give you nightmares?
1822895	1824336	It didn't really give me nightmares.
1824596	1827057	It actually, like, I'm kind of sick.
1827117	1830879	Like, it actually made me want to go, like, explore a cave, just so I could get scared more.
1832720	1833300	Wow.
1833461	1834081	Hold on.
1834161	1836983	And now you know, though, what every gay guy in Amateur County does, Rob.
1837183	1837783	Rice Princess.
1838223	1839524	I wanted to go spelunking.
1841325	1843373	Were you going to go ass spelunking?
1843855	1844256	Shut up.
1845693	1848114	You'll laugh if I tell you the only movie that gave me nightmares.
1848414	1848634	Huh?
1848834	1849554	Poltergeist 3.
1850395	1852215	Some of the Poltergeist movies were kind of scary.
1852295	1853016	It was the mirrors.
1853636	1856337	I was freaked out over mirrors for like a week.
1856997	1858957	I'm not even kidding about the Care Bears movie.
1859017	1865540	Like there's this one part where they go into the fun house and it's like the guy's chasing him and he looks like, you know, crazy.
1865620	1867060	And I'm just like, ah.
1867760	1871402	Oh no, we watched Labyrinth last night and I always get freaked out with the creatures that take their heads off.
1871622	1872562	I know, they're creepy.
1872802	1875684	No, that, when I was a little kid, I would fast forward through that scene, like, no joke.
1875704	1879606	That scared the crap out of me, and... You guys are fucking trivializing my skin.
1879626	1879967	Whatever.
1879987	1880587	Or the helping hand.
1880607	1880967	No, I'm for real.
1880987	1882568	What the fuck does this have to do with Tomb Raider?
1882608	1883189	I'm for real.
1883609	1885991	Well, she was, she was in a scary forest.
1886091	1890694	And then Vice Princess and I, earlier, we were talking about, you know, Return to Oz, and the... I love that movie.
1891454	1899940	Now, Return to Oz... I'm sorry, like, I don't know how, like, any of you that are in, like, your late 20s, early 30s, that saw Return to Oz when it was in theaters...
1900780	1901920	That movie scarred me.
1902701	1903741	It was great.
1903941	1905942	She had the fucking heads and glasses.
1906002	1906742	It was scary.
1907002	1913064	It was based directly off the books and not all watered down like the other movies.
1913104	1916425	And I think that they should do more of those types of movies.
1917305	1917945	Not watered down.
1918005	1920066	I gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
1920626	1925287	Bonds006 says, the Transformer movie from the 80s because someone died and I almost cried.
1925927	1926888	Oh, you know what?
1927128	1927948	And they say shit.
1929363	1930765	No, Bumblebee's like, oh shit.
1931226	1933169	No, it wasn't Bumblebee, it was Cliffjumper.
1934351	1935112	No, it was Bumblebee.
1936053	1938577	But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, no, no, it wasn't.
1938657	1939779	It was What's-His-Face's dad.
1941262	1942664	Said, oh shit, it isn't dented.
1943132	1943372	Spike
1972338	1973498	Okay, I got one more.
1973578	1974659	One more quick line here from chat.
1974679	1975699	Chat.OriginalsRadio.com.
1976199	1977759	SalaciousPop says, LOL, Irene.
1978199	1980160	I ain't mad because if I was mad, you would be dead.
1980360	1980980	I'm on seven.
1981120	1981540	I'm on seven.
1981560	1982661	You don't want to see me on ten.
1982801	1984941	Let's see.
1984961	1986522	Some of the other movies being named in chat right now.
1986822	1987282	Labyrinth.
1987782	1988662	Yeah.
1988942	1990303	Legend with the young Tom Cruise.
1990323	1991263	It was... Oh, okay.
1991503	1993203	Do your... No, no, no.
1993723	1995424	Legend, there's a scene I cannot watch in that movie.
1996044	1998365	The scene at the beginning where he's talking about the unicorns?
1998665	1999305	No, when he...
2001144	2003229	Oh, that scene that we can't talk about because it's a spoiler?
2003711	2003991	Yeah.
2004152	2004452	Okay.
2005467	2014313	No, the scene at the beginning when Tim Curry's talking about the unicorns, and he's like, Mother Night, let your dark arms surround me.
2014413	2016134	And I'm like, oh!
2016174	2017455	You guys are both wrong.
2017495	2019496	It was Frenzy that said, oh, shit.
2020337	2021537	Who's Frenzy?
2022178	2024239	They even have the clip on YouTube.
2024379	2028462	No, I'm talking about when they blew up the ship on Unicron.
2028582	2030103	That was the one that Spike said.
2030123	2033785	Because the line is, oh, shit, it isn't even dented.
2033805	2034866	That one.
2035539	2036860	I wasn't telling you about that
2062314	2073143	Thank you IMDB Anyway, and Robert Stack's character said, damn it, anyway There's somebody we need to bring back as a zombie Robert Stack?
2073423	2084473	Hell yeah Okay, anywho, Atari launched this thing called Atari Go And they want to make classic games good for social gaming
2085869	2086049	Ooh.
2087770	2105516	Basically, Tom Kozik, who is the executive VP of online and mobile gaming, said that they're going to use Atari's catalog and independent developers to, I guess, provide more casual and online social gaming.
2106096	2107736	Basically, it's, here's our old shit.
2107996	2108857	You don't have an Atari.
2109097	2109557	Play this.
2111400	2137667	And I can go, no sir, you're wrong, I have several I don't need your online gaming But we've played their games on like every system that's been released ever Yay, I can play Missile Command again And then like I could put Mr. Awesome on my friends list on Facebook And then just, you know, get all these little like pokes and graphics About how much better he is at Missile Command than me Why can't we just like have Atari go sit in their corner And stop putting out their old shit
2137847	2138528	How about Atari?
2138588	2139949	No.
2141330	2144792	Well, they also, though, are doing more things for the core games as well.
2144812	2152658	They have a Facebook tie-in that's going to unlock extra content, or might unlock extra content for Test Drive Unlimited 2.
2153999	2162266	And then Asteroids Online and Deer Hunter Online, there are going to be reimaginings of those in a socialized context.
2162886	2163707	And I quoted that.
2164247	2166408	How does one socialize in asteroids?
2167549	2168789	Hey, dude, shoot that rock.
2169550	2170830	Dude, I shot your rock.
2171291	2171791	Oh, yeah?
2171831	2173672	Well, my rock's now three rocks and you can't hit them.
2173692	2174552	And that's what's going to be on Facebook.
2174572	2178054	Like, it'll come up and it'll be all, Jamie, shot your rock in asteroids.
2178314	2179515	Click here to shoot her back.
2180796	2181276	Oh, wow.
2181676	2183357	Bitch, I can't believe you shot my rock.
2186759	2188039	This is all free, though, right?
2188980	2189360	Oh, oh.
2189631	2190032	I hope.
2190813	2192637	If it's Facebook, it's gotta be, right?
2192737	2193839	I don't know.
2193939	2195441	They use the word that I hate.
2196957	2224574	Microtransactions I will make the most microtransaction possible A transaction is a transaction But I've been on that site recently I think after this whole thing launched I was able to play Missile Command for free Some of the newer ones were going to have the whole microtransaction I literally played one level and I was like Ah, Missile Command Back to porn A different kind of Missile Command
2226172	2228853	It's basically everyone's night on the internet every day, Rob.
2229593	2230353	Oh, look, something cool.
2230373	2230774	Porn.
2231914	2233855	Well, wait a second.
2235315	2237896	Why don't they do that?
2237936	2240837	I mean, if you think about it, it makes perfect sense to me.
2241197	2243838	Everybody is looking for casual gaming and porn.
2243958	2248219	So why not make a Facebook that's full of porn?
2248239	2248519	AskBook.
2250860	2254302	and just have like, you know, tons of casual games.
2254342	2262607	You know, they could be like Missile Command and stuff, but they're, I don't know, they have porn in the background or, you know, you're playing against porn stars or they're porno themed.
2262627	2267851	Or like asteroids where you have like a big dildo shooting floating vaginas or something.
2268071	2268811	Yeah, sure, whatever.
2268911	2270772	Yeah, sure, whatever.
2270792	2271673	You know, just porn.
2271853	2272353	Any kind of porn.
2272373	2272914	Come on, porn.
2273294	2274155	Coming soon.
2275856	2286263	To the PC, it's the Atari Go I don't like it, stop it Rob Hey, remember that porn we bought years and years ago for Rob?
2286643	2297671	And it was like Summer Boys or something like that And the back said like, watch these boys beat the heat and their meat In this crazy sex-stravaganza Are you really bringing this up on our video game talk show?
2297711	2301534	Because that's the best line I've ever seen on the back of a DVD ever Why?
2303355	2305218	It's why we bought it for you, Rob.
2305738	2306399	Wow.
2307460	2309583	Because you like to watch gay porn.
2309603	2313548	So does Jamie.
2314409	2319735	So do I. But Rob has the ability to sleep through very noisy gay porn.
2321204	2321504	Wow.
2321604	2322425	At Disneyland.
2323105	2324966	Oh yeah, I remember this.
2324986	2326286	That was the clincher right there.
2326546	2328027	At Disneyland.
2328187	2333850	We all went to Disneyland on the trip with the giggling lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
2333870	2337211	That sounds like a story.
2337631	2339952	The giggling lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
2339992	2341133	It was Kristen and Megzi.
2341173	2342293	Go to play Atari Go.
2343114	2344754	And then we're all like awake and Rob's like...
2348337	2359367	Well, all the girls, we had a suite, and it was like a living room with a hide-a-bed, and then there was a closed-off room with two double beds in it, and so Chrissy Megzy had one, and I ignored their slurpy noises.
2360048	2360288	Oh, my.
2363130	2386985	and I was and I was I was you know so we all were awake before Rob and Rob's just like dead to the world and very interesting kind of dramatic like with this pillow half over his head it was funny hold on if you listen carefully can you hear it yeah you hear all that clicking yeah that's all the people unsubscribing from OLR right now so so Kristen takes out her laptop and
2387605	2388626	I brought gay porn!
2391247	2397171	And so it's really loud and she turns up her computer all the way and Rob's just like, snore.
2397871	2410318	And we let it play through like the biggest, you know, this aquatic scene that would make showgirls, you know, completely be shamed.
2410978	2411558	And Rob's just like...
2412853	2413994	I have one more idea for a game.
2414674	2417876	No, this is actually not too bad.
2418796	2426200	You know how they have that kind of hobby that's geocaching or, I guess, GPS hunting, that type of stuff?
2426800	2435344	You call it find porn, or found porn, and basically you hide porn around there and mark it on your GPS location and people can go find the porn.
2435424	2436725	Or there could be a naked slut.
2437881	2439442	Yeah, that's way too much work.
2439542	2440963	I'm going to do that on my computer.
2441103	2443724	Oh, I found porn and I'm going to watch it.
2444285	2446866	That's the new Google Earth little click that you can do.
2446946	2451849	Like just randomly, you have to search the Google Earth for like random porn place and random place.
2451869	2456012	Did I tell you the one time at work I was trying to type in Google and I typed in goggle and it brought up porn?
2457052	2457292	Whoa.
2457312	2458453	That's a few years ago.
2459033	2459774	It was a typo.
2460509	2460969	Oh, whoa.
2461850	2461970	Clever.
2479636	2480737	How about Video Game News?
2480997	2483599	Did you know we do that here on Orange Sons Radio once in a while?
2483719	2484480	Why would we do that?
2484940	2485340	I don't know.
2486081	2488983	Loki, do you have some... Are you busy looking at porn?
2489003	2489403	He's looking at porn.
2489423	2491965	We're making sure... Oh, it's not a real website anymore.
2492185	2492966	Oh, it used to be.
2493026	2493466	It used to be.
2493486	2493987	It used to be.
2494567	2494787	Yeah.
2495488	2495728	Anyways.
2495908	2496809	Big Brother was watching.
2497009	2497949	They were.
2498330	2499571	And they were amused.
2500606	2504008	So, Super Street Fighter 4 is not coming out on PC.
2504669	2508712	I know people are probably surprised considering it's been months since it's been released.
2508792	2516137	But it's not coming out on PC because apparently games are pirated and stuff on the PC.
2516257	2520880	Yeah, they didn't want to release it on PC, I guess.
2520920	2521881	Wait a minute.
2522381	2523262	What does that mean?
2523922	2524783	What does it all mean?
2524903	2529987	I think that their first Street Fighter 4 game got pirated a lot now, I think.
2530827	2549828	Um, apparently they said in a recent interview with 4gamer.net, uh, that, uh, Yoshinori Ono confirmed that, uh, while the PC version of Street Fighter 4 was a big seller worldwide, well, wait a second, that sold a lot and wasn't really pirated that much since...
2551654	2561177	The publisher has no plans to put the new and improved Super Street Fighter 4 iteration on home computers due to the platform's high rate of piracy.
2561737	2567039	They said that the port is still possible if Capcom can find a reasonable DRM solution for the title.
2569770	2572292	Honestly, just forget it.
2573113	2579901	You're going to waste all this damn time, spend all this money on a DRM solution, and it's going to get cracked in a day.
2579941	2580701	Just put it out.
2582183	2582463	Really.
2583985	2589171	You're not going to get pirated any less than if you have DRM on it than not having DRM on it.
2589793	2590414	Thank you for watching!
2610989	2615713	I keep thinking in my mind, I kind of am surprised that companies haven't got to this point.
2615873	2620457	As much as I don't like it as a consumer, it wouldn't surprise me at all if they started going there.
2621237	2627002	It's possible that they do that, but even sometimes there's ways around that, around getting the phone home and typing stuff.
2627302	2650696	you know that kind of thing you could for example have a program running in the background that mimics their authentication server and you just change the forwards on like a certain IP address on your computer so that it forwards to that they've done that for a few things you know like some of the Adobe programs and stuff like that phone home and you can disable that not that I would know
2651296	2653158	Did you hear that, listeners?
2653178	2653858	Don't get me wrong.
2654358	2655999	I don't want folks to hear me the wrong way.
2656019	2662664	I'm not saying I support this DRM to start happening, but I wouldn't be surprised if companies felt like there was no other choice.
2663584	2680256	Big companies like Microsoft and stuff that put out these operating systems and they supposedly have these ways that the system calls home to authenticate Windows and that kind of thing, and yet there's still pirated versions out there despite the fact they're, oh, Windows 7!
2681317	2683119	No, we're going to have stronger security.
2684361	2684902	And pirate it.
2685403	2688968	It's like, okay, so that took three seconds instead of two seconds.
2689109	2694197	Okay, well, in the interest of the companies, I mean, DRM is not...
2695475	2695955	DarkSakura.com
2714390	2730389	you know pirate the game probably weren't going to buy it originally so you're technically not losing sales because if they can't pirate the game they're just not going to download it and they're not going to play it they're not going to you know unless it's a really really good game they're not going to go out and buy it
2732856	2733236	All right.
2733957	2737480	Do you guys remember the old, like, pathetic ways that they used to, like, try to stop pirating?
2737520	2742785	Like, we're going to put a crazy word in the instruction booklet that you have to know, like, to get past the thing.
2742825	2745007	It's like, and then you just tell all your friends.
2745087	2748590	What's the second word on page four of the manual here?
2748610	2753434	Yeah, and what's the crazy, you know, third day of the week, the way we say, you know, it was like, and then you just tell all your friends and it doesn't matter.
2753494	2754074	Or the wheels.
2755035	2755816	I don't remember the wheels.
2756457	2765487	Yeah, for the LucasArts games, they had wheels that you had to rotate around at different things, and then you'd have to read a code number out of one of the slots or something.
2767630	2768110	Wah, wah, wah.
2770144	2799021	and those even didn't work either because you could either photocopy the manual or you could rip apart that disc and photocopy the disc so once again it doesn't matter what DRM solution they put out there even if it's a USB dongle or something like that some really expensive programs like graphic programs and stuff like that that are you know thousands of dollars will actually have a physical device that needs to be plugged into the computer to work those still can be pirated though because people find ways to mimic whatever that device is and
2799821	2801302	There's no way around it.
2801422	2802903	Everybody's going to find a way around something.
2803163	2807805	Given a significant amount of time, there will always be a way around something.
2808125	2809946	Because if you can make it, someone else can make it again.
2811528	2840576	Alright, well, speaking of a game that was somewhat hurt by piracy, allegedly Halo Reach came out, of course, a couple weeks ago and if you already have beat the game and you're already bored of it maybe there should be a mini-game that you should go play that is actually hidden in Halo Reach It's called Reach Racer and it's a warthog racing game that is inside Reach What happens is that if two people get to a spot in the Oni sword base you can actually play this little mini-game
2840896	2842256	and Reach Racer.
2844457	2845177	Oh, you all right over there?
2845237	2846177	You made me drop my mic.
2846457	2846978	Sorry about that.
2847378	2847858	Trauma!
2848598	2850178	I think that's kind of cool.
2850218	2852419	I like when there's fun little things like that in a game.
2853299	2859221	I just know all morning I was hearing boom, yay, boom, yay, boom, yay all morning.
2859381	2860541	Why, was Dan playing Halo Reach?
2860561	2860801	Yes.
2863542	2864422	Is that what he actually says?
2864502	2864982	Yay.
2865082	2869283	No, it has a little party mode thing in there where you get a headshot and the kids go yay.
2871676	2891148	And then they put on the duck boots from Castlevania and go Sorry Bones006 in chat says, okay, that almost made me want to get Reach That's kind of cool Well, the Forge editor and Reach anyways is just really credible anyways, so maybe that's your thing
2892438	2898784	Going back up a little bit in chat, Robert M is talking about the copy protection thing and says, the pages with red paper to keep it from being copied.
2898944	2899845	I remember those too.
2900125	2901847	There were manuals that would have like the red paper.
2902567	2903348	So ridiculous.
2903448	2903968	Dorks.
2904409	2907372	But it kind of worked for a little bit, like until the internet came out.
2907812	2912316	Until they had color scanners and they're like, ah, foil again.
2913857	2914258	Shit.
2914298	2915078	Color copies.
2915098	2918341	Why didn't we think of that?
2920290	2923235	Not available to copy these CDs.
2924798	2927223	Alright, release date's coming up in a minute, but first, DarkSakura.
2928188	2932011	Well, there has been something that has been spotted.
2932731	2934012	A new Wii controller.
2935893	2946020	It's actually the Wii Remote Plus that seems to be a combination of the Wii Motion Plus and the Wii Remote.
2947120	2951863	And it's going to be coming with a game called Fling Smash.
2953425	2957107	Well, it looks like tennis, but with a crazy-ass ball.
2959230	2967512	So you have to use this ball guy named Zip, and you use your controller, I guess, to smack him around the different places.
2967932	2971233	I'd have to see more than just this picture.
2972614	2975995	Now, there is no date out for the UK.
2976615	2979756	The game is listed, but not the special controller.
2980736	2984337	I don't know when they're going to get it overseas.
2985060	2988444	I can't help but feel this is kind of like a Wii Play type thing.
2988764	2988924	It is.
2988944	2991387	Where you throw in a controller with a subpar game.
2991987	2993949	There is no interest in this game whatsoever.
2994010	2999716	Not that I'm judging this game without playing it, but I'm just going to take a wild guess and guess and say it's not very good.
3000456	3002078	It will be the best game of the year.
3002498	3005662	It will be the best selling game of the year because it comes with a stupid remote.
3005982	3013644	Well, if you think about it, the game's $50 and you get a remote that's probably worth at least $50 because I'm sure it's going to be more than just the normal remote.
3014524	3029988	And people should get pissed off because now they bought a remote and stupid Wii Motion Plus and now they come out with something that's all-in-one despite the fact that perhaps they should have, I don't know, put it all-in-one to begin with so that they could do all the stuff that they said they weren't going to be able to do.
3030288	3031028	It prints money!
3033137	3033738	What?
3033778	3036281	DarkKisuke in chat says, whatever, Wii is dead.
3037041	3037602	Do you guys agree?
3038062	3038242	No.
3039243	3040144	What do you think, Rice Princess?
3040164	3040625	We have a Wii.
3042407	3043948	No, I use it for Netflix.
3046591	3049794	It's... Poop.
3050339	3056302	It's doing alright, it's just there's... I mean, the game's coming out that are big releases for Nintendo.
3059403	3063365	I just don't really care too much about, like, ooh, it's Donkey Kong Country again.
3063625	3064726	Wow, that's awesome!
3064766	3066426	I remember playing that back on Super Nintendo.
3066446	3072329	Well, let's not forget how amazed and in awe we all were after E3 at, you know, their lineup and the 3DS.
3072389	3075811	Yeah, I was impressed with Metroid Other M, and then it sucked.
3076531	3077652	Wow, that's awesome.
3077732	3078132	Thank you.
3078173	3080254	I'm glad that Team Ninja really pulled it off.
3080595	3081656	Oh, but it sucked.
3082416	3084698	And then, you know, ooh, new Zelda game.
3086340	3087120	Whoop-dee-shit.
3087220	3092945	It's just a brighter, more colorful, cheerful Twilight Princess with new gadgets and shit.
3093205	3095247	I mean, I don't know.
3095447	3099951	It's... It was... Sounds like fun.
3100232	3102894	It was a difference between, like, you know...
3104807	3107250	What it looks like on paper, what it actually comes out to be.
3110936	3113358	Something that works in theory but not in practice Something that works in theory but not in practice
3139033	3142023	Except now that it has a stupid controller thing in it.
3145071	3145371	All right.
3145651	3150935	Well, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates, things that are coming out to a store near you real soon.
3151875	3153896	This week, actually, some pretty cool stuff coming out.
3154437	3161641	Of course, Dead Rising 2 will be out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week.
3162141	3163002	So that's pretty sweet.
3164062	3166004	Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.
3166244	3171287	You know, what's kind of funny is a lot of the music games coming out nowadays, people don't care.
3172007	3190180	So, uh, but Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock is coming out on, uh, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and we never forget they're all $60, because Activision is fucking lame, and so they decided to charge $60 for all three games, because I don't know, you're suckers and you'll buy it.
3190520	3191941	So, wonderful.
3192161	3195924	Let them get away with that, and then they're gonna be charging $60 for all their Wii games.
3196244	3198386	Oh, but it doesn't matter, because people don't buy games on the Wii.
3199406	3199486	Um...
3200487	3204712	Also, of course, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock will be coming out in different bundles.
3204812	3208656	They have one with the full band set up, which is really just the instruments from last year.
3209116	3210477	So don't expect the new guitar in that.
3210518	3213941	You can only get that in the guitar kit, and they aren't selling the guitar separately.
3214041	3218806	So if you want the lame new guitar that's out there, you're going to have to buy it in that stupid bundle.
3220027	3221348	Other fun stuff coming out this week.
3221388	3222449	A re-release of The Sims 3.
3223449	3225230	They're calling it the Deluxe Edition.
3225530	3227471	I believe that's with some of the download content.
3227772	3229953	Or not download content, but the expansions that were in there.
3234155	3237397	It's Sims 3 and Sims 3 Ambitions.
3237417	3238638	Save you a little bit of money there, I guess.
3239938	3265543	Farm Frenzy Animal Country on the DS Deer Drive on the DS, it's a deer hunting game Front Mission Evolved on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this is kind of not necessarily the tactical strategy game as before but it is a armored core clone so that'll be coming from Square Enix and I don't know if it'll be very good oh and it's also on PC
3267083	3269665	Otlier Rorona, The Alchemists of Arland.
3270325	3272386	That's coming out now on PlayStation 3.
3273067	3276629	It's a role-playing game from Tecmo and I believe Nippon Ichi.
3277729	3281331	MorphX on Xbox 360 from 505 Games.
3283473	3287255	Tropico 3 is getting the Gold Edition coming out on PC.
3289430	3297116	Quantum 3, the Gears of War clone on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 from Tecmo Koei.
3299418	3302440	And crap from Ubisoft.
3302821	3308225	Pets Fantasy, Moonlight Magic and Sunlight Magic.
3308885	3311007	Those are coming out this week on the Nintendo DS.
3311807	3314029	If you like fishing, Rapala's Pro Bash Fishing 2010.
3315630	3320695	on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.
3320755	3324698	They also have a bundle for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3325299	3329182	Those actually come with a wireless fishing rod, except for the Wii.
3329202	3331023	It comes with a crappy attachment for the controllers.
3332685	3349518	FIFA Soccer 2011 coming out in pretty much all systems except for Playstation 2 I believe My Sim Sky Heroes on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii, DS and what else we have coming out
3349778	3351539	Plants vs. Zombies Plants vs. Zombies
3373715	3376016	Greg Hastings Paintball 2 Oops!
3376036	3376816	Prank Party
3397464	3398625	Let's have a prank party.
3399006	3399466	Ah, yes.
3399546	3401668	Can you guess who this is coming to us from?
3402569	3407994	They're a company that used to make really awesome stuff and then they purchased this smaller company.
3409095	3409676	That's right.
3409776	3412438	It's Hudson coming to us from Konami.
3412498	3418304	Thank you, Konami, because we really need some more party games on the Wii because there just wasn't enough party games.
3418324	3419545	What kind of pranks can you pull?
3420606	3421626	That's a good question.
3421726	3423467	What kind of pranks can we pull?
3424087	3425148	Let's see here.
3426388	3427629	Apparently, it's incredibly fun.
3427649	3430830	It's a smart mix of 100 brain-teasing, puzzle-solving, and reflex-testing games.
3431170	3431570	Wait a second.
3431750	3432750	That's not a prank at all.
3433331	3434391	The Haas fooled you.
3434411	3435471	It's actually brain games.
3436172	3436872	Pranks on you.
3437952	3441853	No pantsing, no putting rice in the freezer.
3441993	3448054	Apparently while you're playing the game, though, you can tease the competition with outlandish pranks.
3448514	3450154	All in the name of good, clean fun.
3450234	3456296	Embarrassing outfits, side-splitting, family-friendly pranks that make light-hearted taunts.
3456776	3457056	Oops!
3457116	3462437	Prank Party will have players coming back for more off-the-wall four-player action time and time again.
3463077	3463837	No, they won't!
3464838	3466781	No one cares.
3466821	3469766	Frisbee in chat says, I thought Loki was going to say, oops, pregnant.
3472210	3473532	Oops, pregnant party.
3475295	3476637	I'd go to that party.
3478021	3479021	Oops, I got pregnant.
3479502	3481002	My baby!
3481162	3483463	Actdeft in chat says, Oops, prank party.
3483543	3484984	Isn't that OLR every other week?
3485804	3487704	Oh, zing.
3487744	3488225	Zing.
3488245	3491926	Let's see, Sid Meier's Pirates coming out on Wii this week.
3492686	3495247	The Guild 2 Renaissance on PC.
3495567	3497728	Haunted House, the remake of the Atari game.
3497768	3502570	Thank you, Atari, for bringing out wonderful games that are not... Oh, wait, no, this is a remake of an old...
3503430	3504511	Classic Atari game.
3504751	3506431	That's on the Wii.
3506712	3510714	Guess I'll just have to wait for my Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade version to come out.
3511254	3512795	I'm highly anticipating that one.
3514035	3516736	Frisbee in chat says, cutting the brakes out of someone's car.
3517057	3518957	Now that's a prank party game I'd play.
3519118	3520258	That sounds like fun.
3520318	3523660	Like really horrific things you can't do in real life.
3523700	3527181	Or you know when you offer someone a Jamba Juice and there's no Jamba Juice in there?
3527361	3528302	Shut up, you're a bitch.
3528462	3529142	You're a bitch.
3549901	3556207	And thanks to our wonderful DJ friend from the Bay Area, Get Fit with Mel B's coming out this week on PlayStation 3.
3557288	3563934	Yes, it'll be the first, guess what, this is a collector's item because it's the first PlayStation Move fitness game.
3563954	3568358	Now I'm not really excited about that, it's going to be crap.
3569820	3570721	Hello, I'm Mel B.
3573628	3579993	There's a Jenny McCarthy fitness game on the Wii, and I would love to do all those nasty exercises that must be in this game.
3580053	3585837	Every time I think about the Spice Girls in a video game, though, I just can't help but hear in my mind, let's put another girl through her pieces.
3587078	3590580	If you've ever played the Spice Girls game on PS1, which none of you probably have.
3591180	3593322	Still a few more things coming out this week.
3593342	3594403	Good God.
3594503	3596784	Sorry, it's getting in the fourth quarter stuff.
3596804	3598685	And I love how it's all crap like Oops!
3598745	3600387	Prank Party, just bogging down.
3600427	3604629	Well, okay, there's a lot of crap that comes out in between our Call of Duty games.
3604669	3605190	Make it snappy.
3605950	3607091	Script Spelling Bee.
3607131	3609092	It's a Spelling Bee game on the DS.
3609132	3609953	That'll be exciting.
3610393	3613716	Death Smiles, the version without all the fun extra stuff.
3613856	3615257	It's slightly cheaper on Xbox 360.
3615577	3616918	It's a re-release there.
3617538	3623263	Final Fantasy XIV, the I Had to Wait Another Week edition that is coming to us on PC.
3624785	3627207	Painkiller, Pandemonium on PC.
3627607	3629989	What's pandemonium about it is it's probably not good.
3630690	3631110	And then...
3633436	3637580	I don't think this dates right, but they're saying the Sly Collection is coming out on PlayStation 3.
3637700	3639542	I think it's later in the year.
3640042	3644186	And then finally, this is high quality Wii games for you.
3644467	3650492	This is one of those first party games from Nintendo that's really going to innovate and change the whole landscape of the Wii.
3651153	3651653	Wii Party.
3653175	3653936	Coming to us on the Wii.
3654296	3656638	That's also from Hudson that made the Mario Party games.
3656698	3657579	I played it at E3.
3657619	3658099	It was cute.
3659306	3661047	But it's another party game.
3661848	3665311	That's just like them complaining on the GameCube.
3665331	3666932	People only buy it for kids' stuff.
3667012	3668113	It's only got kids' games.
3669053	3673036	Why can't we get people to actually develop mature games on our system?
3673056	3674377	I don't know why.
3674998	3677039	You know, I have a question for anyone.
3677780	3677900	No.
3678652	3690838	Okay, when you've heard of this game that's going to come out and it's really hyped and it sounds really good and you really want to play it and then you actually get it, lately, has it lived up to the hype for you?
3692298	3694319	You mean like Final Fantasy XIV when I played the beta?
3694339	3694540	Yeah.
3694660	3696021	Yeah, I wanted to cry.
3697041	3697662	Tears of joy?
3697862	3698102	No.
3699103	3699783	Tears of pain.
3700163	3700604	Don't worry.
3700644	3708189	They're limiting the amount of suffering you actually have to endure because you can't play long hours on this game because they will start dropping your XP.
3708869	3709310	Really?
3709510	3709670	Yes.
3710011	3713495	I haven't played the full game yet, and like, here's the sick thing.
3713515	3714857	Y'all, I am really sick, okay?
3714877	3715578	We know you're sick.
3715638	3716259	Here's the thing.
3717480	3722526	Even though, like, I really hated the beta, I still feel like I need to buy the retail game to give it a fair chance.
3722546	3722607	Why?
3722627	3722727	Why?
3722747	3726792	Because I spent so much time on XI, and it's a Final Fantasy game.
3726852	3727473	Sub!
3728073	3729875	That's exactly what I'm talking about.
3730276	3730696	Just say no.
3730716	3730857	I can't.
3730877	3732879	The state of the industry these days.
3733379	3734701	I have a problem.
3735181	3736303	You do have a problem.
3736343	3738225	It's called wasting your money on shit.
3739807	3740347	Don't do it, Ron.
3740367	3742229	How about you just wait for the reviews to come out?
3742550	3746034	Yeah, I'm gonna try and see if some of the reviews, what they say.
3746897	3747918	Thank you for watching!
3762638	3763979	What do you think, Rob?
3766361	3766701	I don't know.
3766801	3769864	I thought Final Fantasy XIII was pretty awesome and it had a lot of hype behind it.
3769964	3771845	I mean, not XIV, but XIII was pretty good.
3773426	3773826	I don't know.
3774107	3775868	Sometimes the hype machine can kind of ruin games.
3776548	3781012	I think part of the reason I didn't want to buy Halo Reach is that you just can't get away from it.
3781492	3787216	I was playing Lara Croft online and I actually got an Xbox Live message from somebody who was like, what, you're not playing Halo Reach?
3787256	3787817	And I'm just like...
3788457	3789018	Screw you!
3789078	3789938	I'll play what I want!
3790639	3797443	I'm like, I'm gonna put in frickin' Cameo or one of the Xbox 360 launch games just to irritate you.
3797823	3802246	But then I realized I'd actually have to play Cameo and I don't know if that would actually be fun.
3802387	3809051	I saw someone this week playing on my friends list and you know who you are, I think, because I don't remember who you are.
3810572	3812633	Someone was actually playing Lost Via Domus.
3813594	3814054	What is that?
3814174	3816556	The Lost console game.
3816576	3816636	Wow.
3818257	3825060	All right, let's go to Japanese release dates of Loki's done with the U.S.
3838561	3841683	Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2
3868339	3871902	A game called Quantum Theory comes out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
3872143	3873724	There's a regular and limited edition.
3873784	3878609	It looks like a Bayonetta-y type of game.
3878689	3884636	Lots of epic-looking cutscenes and guns and swords and limbs falling off and all that fun stuff.
3884656	3885296	That's from Tecmo.
3886297	3887379	I wonder if it's a Team Ninja game.
3887839	3888520	I don't think it is, though.
3888960	3889621	Thanks for watching!
3907612	3911573	Going over to the Nintendo Wii to check out the releases over there.
3912033	3914594	We have really not a lot this week.
3914674	3915494	It's kind of slow.
3915574	3921736	Really, the next big, big release is the Kaito no Kirby game, which would be Kirby's Epic Yarn over here.
3921836	3924776	That comes out in Japan on the 14th of October.
3925476	3927077	Before that, not a lot of big stuff.
3928257	3931999	PlayStation 2, obviously things have really slowed down, so nothing of note there.
3932719	3938902	On the Nintendo DS, Okamiden, Chisaki Tayo comes out this week in Japan, so that's on the Nintendo DS.
3939223	3940723	That's Okami, Okamiden.
3941023	3943585	Yeah, Okamiden comes out there.
3944545	3945005	Well, no.
3945226	3949648	But it's Okami, they added an extra syllable to the end.
3949688	3952209	Made in Kakeriko Village, instead of Kakariko.
3952992	3958955	No, it just threw me off because I was like, wait, wait, brain reorganize.
3959475	3961116	It looks very cute.
3961496	3963457	And I know we've seen some of the stories on this before.
3963617	3964278	Y'all right over there?
3965598	3971201	Sorry, I just noticed this little post on Kotaku.
3971221	3973102	They put like screen grabs every now and then.
3973562	3974783	It's all on this one.
3975423	3978024	The official Kirby's Epic Yarn website.
3978604	3986707	So check out Kirby's Epic... He's throwing a star and it looks like a giant penis coming out of him.
3986827	3987367	Penis.
3988108	3988628	It does.
3989228	3989548	All right.
3990688	3992129	Lots of stuff on the PSP this week.
3992169	3992609	Go figure.
3992689	3994530	In Japan this week, Dragon Ball Tag vs...

3998154	3999495	A game called K-On!
3999856	4001678	Hukago Live comes out this week.
4001698	4007986	That's a big thing for a lot of fans who are... It's a little music game with chicks who rock.
4008006	4008727	It's from an anime.
4009268	4010630	Oh boy, so it's like a music game.
4010670	4013674	Yeah, and people on Twitter won't shut up about it.
4014416	4042374	Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2 gets a price reduction and then I'm sure DarkSakura is going to pre-order this game maybe Rice Princess 2 Twinkle Crusaders Go Go in regular and limited edition I'm going to go go and pre-order that now that looks wonderful looks like a little fighting type of game Rob go out there and get us ice cream so I can do I will not yeah it's an ice cream truck
4043168	4044489	You can't hear the ice cream truck?
4045569	4048691	I didn't think they had real ice cream trucks anymore except for like the pedo vans.
4048711	4053113	You know, when I have kids someday, I'm going to tell them when they hear that chime, it's the toy collector.
4053133	4055214	And if you have a messy room, they're going to come get all your toys.
4055594	4056535	So that way I never have kids.
4056555	4059957	Who was it you that said that you were told it was the spinach truck?
4060517	4061037	No.
4062098	4066420	I have a friend who... That's the kind of thing I'm going to do.
4066560	4069722	One of my friends' mom would tell them that it was the spinach truck.
4070522	4072744	DarkSakura, UK releases, please.
4097972	4098393	A bunch.
4099735	4102719	On the 28th, we have Atelier Rorona.
4104461	4106544	Sorry, I just got an IM.
4107646	4109969	Tiara says she just tuned in to hear Spinach Truck.
4115010	4138760	On the 28th, also Battle vs. Chess, Borderlands, Claptraps, New Robot Revolution, Dead Rising 2, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, Swords, and then on the 29th we have Hydrophobia, the 30th, F1 2010, Final Fantasy XIV Online, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Predator, Tom Clancy's Hawks 2,
4140761	4147505	Also on October 1st, FIFA 11, Sean White Skateboarding, Tom Clancy's Hawks 2, again, out for PC.
4148406	4149426	And that's it for this week.
4152128	4152588	The end!
4154230	4154710	Of that.
4156051	4159453	Fiend.
4159913	4163035	So, something that hopefully you didn't purchase, APB.
4165120	4165940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4186889	4193333	People have been trying to get refunds via Steam and haven't really met with any success on that.
4194174	4197236	But EA apparently is going to try to help people out.
4197677	4203921	It says the user's been posting about their experience talking to EA support regarding this issue.
4204441	4209245	Several users have been able to receive a $20 discount code for their inconvenience.
4211195	4212796	Dragon Age 2 Dragon Age 2 Dragon Age 2
4230803	4243253	So I guess if you bought APB you may want to go chat with EA support which is of course support.ea.com and see if they can help you out and get you some of your money back that you spent on it.
4247076	4248216	You're gross Rob.
4249517	4249878	Sorry.
4250038	4250298	Sorry.
4250999	4252920	Totally listening to Loki right now I promise.
4253480	4253681	Yes.
4254241	4256503	Well I'm not talking anymore so that's not really helpful.
4257564	4259487	Aw, we're still listening to you.
4259647	4266114	Okay, I was offering Rice Princess some black licorice, and she was like, ew, no, get that out of my face, gross.
4266134	4267756	Well, it looks like dog crap.
4267816	4269358	I don't want your licorice.
4269398	4269959	It's really good.
4269999	4270800	You want some, DarkSakura?
4271401	4272262	I can't have licorice.
4272282	4273283	Oh, that's right, you can't have licorice.
4273904	4277568	And Dan insists on eating it around me in his car, and I'm like, gag.
4278484	4279225	It's really good.
4279285	4284108	So what I had to do, since Rice Princess loves it so much, I waved the bag in front of her face so she could get the smell.
4284688	4286069	And then she's like, sure, I want one.
4286810	4289052	And that means she just wants to take one to throw it at me.
4289492	4291373	So I let her put her hand in the bag to grab one.
4291393	4292974	She's all, ew, they're slimy.
4293114	4293795	Gross.
4293995	4294796	They are.
4294816	4298238	It's like you put them up your butt before you put them in the bag.
4298258	4298538	It's so gross.
4298558	4299099	Knock it off.
4299999	4300299	All right.
4301821	4303602	Oh, yeah, bummer about APB and all that.
4304980	4309224	But I feel bad for those customer service reps that have to deal with all the angst.
4309244	4310725	Because you know it's going to open the floodgate.
4310825	4320874	Once you hear that one person got something free, now, thanks in part to this show, there's going to be tons of people that go on there and are like, I want my free stuff.
4320954	4321534	I bought APB.
4321554	4322495	Where's my free stuff?
4323496	4324296	Just like that, yeah.
4324316	4327357	I found a Christmas card that was sent to us.
4327377	4328037	Hello, random!
4328517	4329438	No, it's cool.
4329458	4332859	It was sent to me by one of our listeners, by Rob Overseas.
4333859	4339500	And it says, Fuck office parties, fuck jingle bells, fuck mince pies, fuck Rudolph, fuck Santa, fuck Christmas.
4339680	4341301	How appropriate, since you're Jewish now.
4341941	4344202	Yes, I'm going to put it up on my desk right now.
4345002	4345522	Good idea.
4346835	4348676	All right, hey.
4348796	4351058	SSJ100Matt wants to know, so what's the difference?
4351098	4352819	Is the black licorice bigger and longer?
4354000	4355380	Just tastier, actually.
4356561	4358362	Yeah, if you like the taste of shit.
4358963	4360264	Black licorice is amazing.
4360724	4361024	All right.
4361044	4362765	That's gross.
4363245	4363866	You're gross.
4364106	4365267	Your face is gross.
4365607	4367508	Hey, this game's awesome, though.
4367568	4368449	It's not gross at all.
4368529	4369389	You don't know Jack.
4369429	4370130	Remember this game?
4370190	4372331	This is like the best video game ever.
4372431	4373512	I loved this game.
4373712	4375153	That's hardly a video game, but yeah.
4375193	4376895	That's like a game show-y type of game.
4377175	4383501	Well, anyway, it's been rated by the ESRB for the 360, the Wii, and the PlayStation 3.
4383941	4384842	And you know what that means?
4385262	4389106	It's coming out soon because the ESRB always ruins and spoils releases.
4389566	4391007	So it looks like it is really happening.
4391707	4393168	THQ is revamping it.
4393868	4397430	All we know is that the game got rated on crude humor.
4398030	4399611	Quote, Yay, more dick and fart jokes.
4399671	4400051	My favorite.
4412768	4414510	Yay, I never talk about those.
4415070	4415590	Not at all.
4415731	4415991	Ever.
4416251	4418433	So, I'm so excited about this.
4418493	4419774	Okay, the picture's going up on Orange Lounge.
4419994	4420535	What'd you put a picture?
4420575	4420935	Of my card.
4420955	4421496	Oh, of your card.
4423617	4425659	You should put a picture up of Rice Princess holding black liquor.
4425679	4426099	It should be exciting.
4426119	4427320	No, ew, I'm never touching it ever again.
4427641	4428001	Shut up.
4429763	4437089	All right, I think this means now that our show is starting to completely derail, it's time to bring it back to some classics.
4439480	4439961	DarkSakura.com
4449284	4455870	You kids and your spinach trucks, you need to stop chasing the spinach truck and play this video game for a little bit.
4455930	4457332	DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?
4457852	4458913	Elevator Action!
4460255	4460655	Whoa.
4462457	4463818	Elevator, go down.
4463998	4465920	Go down the hole.
4466901	4470644	Elevator Action is, first of all, this is Dan's suggestion.
4471445	4472846	I love the sound effects.
4473107	4474088	This is from the arcade version.
4481707	4483028	Elevator Action Returns
4501907	4504490	Um, the game is great.
4504890	4508053	It's, uh, the music was done by Yoshino Imamura.
4508794	4512117	So, let's go on with how the game is played.
4512538	4514740	You play as Spy and you go down an elevator.
4515267	4515547	In the face.
4531941	4535884	So you either have to shoot them back or run away or hide.
4536945	4541829	And you get all your documents and you go from the top of the building to the bottom.
4542830	4547854	And the lower that you get, you actually have to solve more puzzles to get around it.
4548694	4554419	The control was a four-way joystick, two buttons, one for shoot and the other for jumping and kicking.
4555339	4557081	Because I always jump and kick at the same time.
4557836	4559618	So, very, very simple, easy game.
4559718	4561119	Two players, you need to alternate times.
4561179	4564282	You play as Agent 17, codenamed Otto.
4567105	4571890	So, um, you don't have a timer, but you do have a time limit.
4572730	4574893	It goes into a hurry-up mode.
4575693	4578036	So the music will change and tell you to hurry up.
4578696	4579137	Pretty much.
4580993	4585399	Yeah, you can get crushed to the elevator too if you're not careful.
4597415	4603100	Knock out an agent by jumping or kicking, eliminate an agent by gun, and you get bonus points completing each round.
4603680	4606743	And you also get an extra life when you hit 10,000 points.
4607444	4615431	As far as versions of it, there is actually a parody called Ella Paper Action, which is a
4617861	4618701	That sounds stupid.
4620542	4624742	They had two of them on Palm OS, Agent Z and Agent Z2.
4625443	4626643	It's based on Elevator Action.
4627303	4630604	There's Dexter's Laboratory Robot Rampage that's based on Elevator Action 2.
4630924	4637725	505 Games put a similar game out on the Wii called Spy Games Elevator Mission.
4638425	4640106	It's called Elevator Combat in Europe.
4640826	4642006	There's a port on Game Boy.
4642086	4646147	There's an NES version that made it onto the Virtual Console in 2007.
4647727	4653172	and Elevator Action Death Parade is a light gun shooter that uses elevator doors when changing scenes.
4654773	4655854	So, there you go.
4658505	4669075	As far as earlier ports, there was the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Game Boy.
4669175	4674100	There was one planned for the Atari 2600, but it never was released.
4674140	4678304	However, the prototype exists and was sold at Classic Gaming Expo 2001.
4680106	4682269	It was only 95% complete, though.
4682869	4684471	And then Sony had a mobile version of it.
4685051	4697465	As far as compilations, we have Elevator Action EX for Game Boy Color, Elevator Action Old and New Game Boy Advance, Elevator Action Returns on Sega Saturn, which I think I have, Taito Legends set in the Taito Legends Power-Up, and...
4700210	4701451	So can I be honest about something?
4701491	4701691	What?
4701832	4702932	I think this game sucks.
4703112	4714901	Like, it's one of those things I remember much more fondly as a child, but I actually bought that title collection when it was out on the regular Xbox and kind of revisited this game and I was like, this game is horrible.
4715501	4718603	But I think part of that's just because it's really hard and I always get crushed by elevators.
4718783	4721325	I've seen Dan play through this game just like all the time.
4721545	4721825	Really?
4722246	4725748	And when I said, hey Dan, help me think of a classic game, he's like, elevator action.
4727049	4727149	Okay.
4727169	4727309	Okay.
4728610	4730494	No, I mean, it is a classic in some regards.
4730534	4734220	I thought it was one of those games that always kind of looked better than it played.
4734601	4737726	You know what game in this vein that I actually like a whole lot better?
4738387	4738668	Mappy.
4739965	4741767	I don't think you've ever done that for the week, have you?
4742187	4743388	You might need to do that.
4743789	4745510	Maybe Mappy will be on the list one day.
4745530	4745910	All right.
4746271	4746771	Well, there it is.
4747131	4748573	Good Namco goodness.
4749173	4752176	Like it or not, your classic game of the week, Elevator Action.
4752336	4753297	Elevator Action.
4753377	4753817	There it is.
4754578	4757961	That's a pretty cool YouTube to the guy beating the level because he makes it look so easy.
4758381	4759122	It's really not.
4759702	4760503	This game is hard.
4760523	4761664	Have you ever played this game, Rice Princess?
4762044	4762184	No.
4762224	4762905	It's hard.
4763485	4764066	Looks like it.
4764186	4764426	It is.
4764987	4765207	Okay.
4765507	4789870	Alright, well that's going to do it for this first half here of Orange Lounge Radio But don't go anywhere, there's plenty more when we come back Including your phone calls and your tweets Make sure you get in those Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR And we're going to talk about PlayStation 3 updates That wrecked some things related to USB We're going to talk about a website that will bribe you with Microsoft points to use it And much more when we come back after this break With more of Orange Lounge Radio
4797028	4799369	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4799389	4808615	We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 26th of 2010, where we are taping the 383rd episode of our podcast, if you can believe it.
4808915	4809335	Damn.
4809455	4810016	I know, right?
4810216	4813097	We're almost, 400 is right around the corner, if you think about it.
4813137	4815519	It's gonna be, what, about 17 weeks away?
4815539	4816359	It's about four months away?
4816879	4817060	Wow.
4817080	4818400	So, right around Christmas, New Year's?
4818460	4818641	Yeah.
4819041	4819381	Crazy, huh?
4819401	4819521	Mm-hmm.
4819681	4820161	A little bit.
4820181	4821062	No, wait, a little further than that.
4822002	4822983	Like January, February.
4823023	4824244	Maybe just in time for Valentine's Day.
4824264	4824344	Yeah.
4824935	4826336	Whoa, cool.
4826376	4826676	I know.
4827677	4827957	All right.
4828417	4831139	Joining us tonight, as you can hear, Rice Princess and The Doctor.
4831800	4836243	And we were talking a little bit about the break music, which I know you podcaster folks can't hear it, sadly.
4836303	4837123	It's copyright stuff.
4837163	4837623	I'm sorry.
4837643	4838164	You can't play it.
4838564	4839945	But we can do it live.
4840405	4842867	And we played a variety of songs during that break.
4842927	4846529	And the last one we played was from Secret of Mana, the Flight into the Unknown.
4846830	4849271	And that made Jamie go, let's have a Secret of Mana party.
4849311	4850852	And I'm like, wow, yes, that's a great idea.
4850992	4851493	For sure.
4851533	4851733	Yeah.
4852113	4854396	SRSers Don't take a picture of me please because I'm in my pajamas Or me
4867395	4869036	The Doctor's Taking Pictures in Studio.
4869056	4869637	I don't know why.
4869717	4870217	I'm just kidding.
4870237	4870597	Yeah.
4871198	4875501	The secret about a marathon would be fun.
4875581	4877282	I actually got really far in secret at Evermore.
4877322	4878603	I got really close to beating it.
4878623	4879163	I never did, though.
4879183	4879864	I love that game.
4879904	4882846	I don't think Evermore is nearly as bad as some people think it was at the time.
4882866	4883266	I don't know.
4883366	4884427	People thought it was bad?
4884767	4885308	Yeah, oh yeah.
4885528	4887149	Wow.
4887309	4887990	You know what we should do?
4888030	4889211	We should do RPG a month.
4890152	4891013	RPG a month.
4891173	4891713	Seriously.
4891734	4892875	Good luck tearing me away from WoW.
4895057	4896658	That's Rob's RPG of life.
4897018	4909450	Maybe, oh, something else about Secret of Evermore, because another song we played in that break was the theme to Guild Wars, which I think that composer that does the soundtrack to Guild Wars, Jeremy Soule, I think is how you say his last name?
4910070	4937448	is really talented and he composed that when he was like practically a teenager like 19 or 20 I think he did Secret of Evermore like when he was a teenager he actually I think composed that soundtrack so crazy right so I think actually no I think it took the back he was 19 when he did I think the Secret of Evermore stuff and then later on probably in his 20s he did the Guild War stuff but he was very young when he did a lot of that and he did the music to Oblivion which I know you're not a big fan of that game but the soundtrack is amazing I believe it
4937648	4938548	Yeah, he's a talented guy.
4939908	4946410	He did the music to Prey, which even though it was kind of a... Actually, it's one of the few first-person shooters I really, really, really liked.
4946470	4947050	And you know why?
4947470	4950890	Because it was made for people who are terrible at first-person shooters because you never die.
4951330	4952271	You cannot die in Prey.
4952891	4953691	It's easy mode.
4954571	4962552	When you die, you go into the spirit world where you have to shoot these ghost-looking things to regain your health and stuff, and then you go back right where you left off.
4963212	4964673	So Prey is like total easy mode.
4965193	4966113	But it had really good music.
4966973	4967714	So, anyway.
4967854	4968274	Cool.
4969015	4969395	There you go.
4970035	4973018	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com You're playing Plants vs. Zombies.
4974018	4981423	Salacious Pop in chat says, People who hated Evermore were just being 16-year-old weeaboo square stands and didn't like it because it was Square USA developed.
4981964	4984245	And Ranma is starting a fight saying, Actually, no.
4984365	4985166	It took a week to beat.
4985246	4985686	That's why.
4986967	4987508	Throw down.
4988308	4988869	You know what?
4989229	4990310	It had a dog in it.
4990670	4992111	That made it instantly cool.
4992191	4993492	So, there you go.
4994088	4996512	Alright, let's get back into some more video game news here.
4997093	5002903	Twitter topics coming up at twitter.com slash OLR in just a little bit, so make sure you're... Are you alright over there, DarkSakura?
5004175	5004696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5025157	5025657	Good job.
5026678	5026998	All right.
5027598	5028779	Again, get those Twitter topics in.
5028799	5030660	We're going to be getting to those in just a moment.
5030740	5034322	But in the meantime, some fast, rapid-fire news, starting with Loki.
5035320	5039142	Yes, there is an update done to 3D.GameHeroes this week.
5039222	5042043	You may remember that game, the one that's kind of like Zelda, but not.
5043063	5049246	This time they've done an update that adds a Sackboy playable character, which is kind of cool.
5049866	5062811	And then on top of that, there's also some 50 new player-made heroes that have been added to everyone's lineup, plus allows the players to carry weapons over into their new game plus files.
5063691	5069814	and incorporate a handful of bug fixes that they've done to the game.
5069894	5070774	So that's kind of cool.
5071354	5071895	Sounds awesome.
5071915	5075036	That's one of those games I played maybe the first third and then stopped.
5075056	5076897	I have not touched my copy of it yet.
5076957	5084700	It's actually so... Again, it is The Legend of Zelda on PS3 and I am surprised Nintendo has not sued yet.
5084880	5087821	It is that close to the original Legend of Zelda.
5088221	5091603	You'd like this game, I think, Grace Princess, because you like the old school games, right?
5092083	5093624	I do like the old school games.
5093804	5100087	Well, this 3D.GameHero is like one big BJ to old video games.
5100347	5100907	Wow.
5100927	5101488	I know, right?
5101548	5102148	That's hot.
5102228	5102528	I know.
5103449	5105610	Wait, so which Zelda is it most like?
5105930	5106850	The very, very first one.
5107150	5107270	Oh.
5108511	5110492	Not my favorite, but I would like it.
5111404	5118830	This week marked the first releases to the PlayStation Store of PlayStation 1 Imports.
5119231	5121773	Yes, now we're able to play games from other regions.
5122513	5127958	And the first two releases, you may wonder what they are.
5128819	5130720	Cho Inoki and Gaia Seed.
5130740	5131021	Yay!
5133120	5133761	Boo.
5133861	5135083	Joe Heineke is great.
5135744	5138687	So you'll be able to get those on the PlayStation Store.
5139469	5140550	They will run you $6 or $5.99.
5140690	5142473	Let's see other fun stuff.
5148240	5154184	There is a fan-made Half-Life 2 movie trailer that was put out.
5154945	5159748	Now, this is not just some amateur movie trailer, by the way.
5159808	5164051	It's actually done by an animator, Marco Spittoni.
5164751	5168134	And he's actually... I believe he works for Weta.
5168774	5172196	So he has one damn sexy trailer out there that...
5173377	5174518	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5201668	5212038	New Detroit, which is the city that the game is going to take place in, and also looks like it carries over some of the stuff from Earth Defense Force 2, including a jetpack.
5212058	5215100	And I believe there's four different upgrade armors you're going to be able to get.
5215240	5217663	I'm assuming one of them is this jetpack thing.
5219522	5219922	I can't wait.
5220443	5221604	It's supposed to be coming out this fall.
5222005	5222865	Or not this fall.
5223386	5223947	That'd be cool.
5224287	5225188	No, this spring.
5226149	5233076	Speaking of trailers, since you brought up that Half-Life 2 trailer, did you see that freaking Pokemon real life trailer?
5233336	5235238	Pokemon Armageddon or whatever it was?
5235258	5235919	That was dumb.
5236039	5238321	What in the heck was that?
5238601	5239943	For those that didn't see it, it's like real...
5241264	5242645	Have you guys seen Rice Princess?
5243086	5246748	I started watching it but then I realized it was Pokemon and I was just like, what the fuck am I doing?
5246768	5251012	It's like somebody took Pokemon and made it real life and it's obviously like a student project or something.
5251052	5252993	It was like a big budget student project.
5253613	5256576	It's crazy how kind of... I love the Team Rocket thing.
5258017	5263461	The effects were good enough for sci-fi television because that's what the special effects look like.
5263481	5265723	It was like the really bad Sharktopus kind of effects.
5266843	5267384	That's awesome.
5267704	5268825	Yeah, just saying.
5270638	5276360	So this got me thinking here because, again, there's folks in chat talking about role-playing games and stuff.
5276420	5278301	Salacious Pop is saying, you know what I really enjoyed?
5278341	5281062	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest because I played it knowing it was kiddie.
5281422	5283363	You know, that game wasn't as terrible as everybody outmade it to be.
5283383	5285123	It just wasn't Final Fantasy, just like XI.
5286384	5290425	But actually, I think DarkSakura might be onto something with the role-playing game of the month.
5290545	5291486	You know, I have an idea.
5291726	5292206	What do you guys think?
5292606	5299789	Like, we pick a role-playing game, like a classic of some sort, that we would see who can get the furthest in like a month.
5301178	5301638	DarkSakura.com
5331810	5333611	Well, sometimes they do, actually.
5334492	5336513	Whoa.
5336593	5344518	Maybe we should just pick one night where we've got nothing going on and do the Zelda Fest.
5346719	5346880	What?
5347020	5349121	No, I was talking about role-playing, not Zelda Fest.
5349141	5350021	Quit trying to change the subject.
5350041	5350422	No, no, no.
5350682	5353584	It's like the Zelda Fest, where you see who can get the furthest.
5354584	5356185	Ah, okay, okay.
5356205	5357266	By a certain time limit.
5358007	5358948	We could do something like that.
5358968	5359830	It could be interesting.
5359850	5360410	It would be fun.
5360611	5365437	I'm going to be still playing Damn Plants vs. Zombies because I recognize the music because it plays in my sleep now.
5367051	5371413	and SSJ100 Matt says this will happen when Rob and Jamie actually play their magic card battle.
5371433	5372654	Oh yeah, that was like a year ago, right?
5374695	5375676	No, I found them recently.
5375716	5376456	Magic.
5376997	5377277	Alright.
5377337	5378157	I have two sealed decks.
5378818	5380098	Let me get back into some quick news here.
5380699	5384020	This is news that makes me very happy and I know it'll make Loki very, very happy.
5384121	5390124	Rumors abound once again that Capcom is indeed working on a new Mega Man Legends game.
5391305	5392105	As they should be
5420646	5422107	The Shadow The Shadow
5439560	5441962	and you have to trust The Shadow because Alec Baldwin played him.
5442022	5442142	No.
5442663	5448588	But The Shadow also pegged the release date of Mega Man 9 and some of the very specific details in the game.
5448708	5451190	So it's somebody who has kind of done this before.
5451610	5452351	So who knows?
5452971	5453732	Could be very cool.
5454533	5455073	I'm excited.
5455133	5456054	I would love to see.
5457135	5465682	Kind of something we didn't get to tonight but I know had been floating around out there was a Mega Man Doom mod that made Doom look like Mega Man Legends kind of.
5465862	5467463	It was actually kind of awesome I have to admit.
5467483	5468124	So dorky.
5468564	5473866	So we have, let's see, when the Kinect comes out, we're going to have Dance Masters from Konami.
5473886	5476747	We're going to have Dance Central from Harmonix.
5477027	5477568	Well, guess what?
5477668	5481069	Overseas, they're getting a game called Dance Paradise in Europe.
5481529	5484430	It's coming from Mindscape and Universal Music.
5485150	5486611	It's going to be coming out when the Kinect comes out.
5486671	5488132	No word on a release over here.
5488752	5494294	But just to give you kind of a heads up on what to expect in this game, since it is a partnership with Universal Music...
5494694	5496396	You do have some pretty big names in this.
5496716	5499679	For instance, David Guetta and Kelly Rowland, When Love Takes Over.
5500120	5501701	Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For.
5502082	5503603	Lady Gaga, Bad Romance.
5503743	5504904	LaRue, Bulletproof.
5505345	5506866	MC Hammer, Can't Touch This.
5507347	5508628	No Doubt, Hey Baby.
5510410	5515935	I love that all of those songs were in the last few months and then MC Hammer with Can't Touch This from 30 years ago.
5516496	5517337	But it's a classic.
5517857	5524702	Sophie Ellis-Bexter with Murder on the Dance Floor and the Doctor's favorite song, Jerry Halliwell with It's Raining Men.
5524882	5528545	Remember, MC Hammer needs money.
5529825	5534769	But then I'm looking at screenshots of the game and I'm kind of like, oh, this looks like it's going to be kind of a cheap hack of a game.
5534849	5535269	I don't know.
5535569	5537491	I don't know if it looks really that good.
5537831	5543115	But the song list is pretty darn good because they did team up with Universal Music.
5543215	5544375	So, yeah.
5545356	5548238	So 20 of the 40 songs have been announced so far.
5548358	5550419	So yeah, I don't know.
5551000	5552261	Interested to see more in that.
5552861	5554222	Also, one other story.
5554582	5558705	There's rumors going around this week that Project Milo was canceled this week.
5559906	5562227	19 contractors that were working on the project were let go.
5562628	5567951	Some of the other people that were on the project are going to be using the technology in a new Fable-themed Kinect game.
5568231	5572414	When your game doesn't have a title, it's probably not going to come out yet.
5572434	5573435	Yeah.
5573875	5574456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5601198	5602059	I got some stuff!
5602699	5603340	How about Rock Band?
5604280	5609564	We have the download content coming out that will be a lot of Anthrax.
5609845	5610465	Woohoo!
5610485	5611686	I love Anthrax.
5612427	5620633	So the Anthrax pack will be Among the Living, I'm the Man, Indians, Madhouse, which I love that song, and Metal Thrashing Mad.
5621173	5623575	Actually the later two are live versions.
5624156	5625697	And the whole pack will be 680 Microsoft points.
5627418	5628839	for individual tracks coming out.
5629259	5630979	Stuff, again, that I have to get.
5631780	5635601	My Chemical Romance, I'm Not Okay, and Welcome to the Black Parade.
5636041	5637342	Totally, totally want both of those.
5638102	5644565	30 Seconds to Mars, Closer to the Edge, Atreyu, Cough and Nails, Buckcherry, Out of Line, and two Doobie Brothers tracks.
5644625	5646045	Listen to the music in Long Train Runnin'.
5646865	5648846	I still can't believe there's a band called Atreyu.
5650667	5652448	There's a band called Ludo.
5653788	5654328	That's awesome.
5654708	5655869	Yes, and they're pretty cool.
5657191	5660115	So as far as other stuff, how about Cave Story?
5661117	5666023	There is going to be a DSiWare and what?
5666464	5667145	I heard a gasp.
5667445	5669128	I like Cave Story and that looks really cool.
5669348	5673694	Is that a screenshot that we're looking at here that's a cool updated version of the Cave Story graphics on the screen?
5674848	5688643	Basically, and actually, yeah, this picture was commissioned in honor of the announcement, so I guess it's maybe an idea of what it might be like.
5689584	5694609	Um, but at any rate, um, it's going to be a DSiWare, uh, version of the game.
5695430	5698653	And it will, they say it's done, they're just testing it.
5699474	5706882	And, um, it's apparently going to, uh, have a, uh, classic one and, uh, an updated one.
5706922	5706982	Uh.
5708463	5712806	and then, last but not least, Donkey Kong Country for Wii.
5713587	5721913	It's called Donkey Kong Country Returns and it comes with a banana pocket for your, it's like a condom for your condom, for your Wii.
5723781	5728305	Anyway, it comes with this banana thing that you can put your Wiimote into.
5728986	5731528	So, double banana?
5731588	5732649	It's a banana pouch.
5734551	5737494	I just keep thinking maybe I'm just dirty.
5737514	5738115	Banana hammock?
5740978	5741979	It's a penis joke!
5745118	5763555	at any rate if you pre-order it you get beta access and downloadable skins and the bananas are probably limited edition should be out on November 21st like anyone gives a crap okay I'll probably get it because you just like to have more stuff I want a banana
5764844	5766065	Twitter Topics
5789474	5791975	Every week you guys send us tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
5791995	5793035	We're going to start off tonight.
5793115	5796296	Spazinator sends us one tweet with two topics.

5804737	5805718	Oh, indeed I did.
5805998	5806978	Yeah, does this surprise you?
5806998	5809278	No, because I haven't been to Blockbuster in months.
5809318	5810759	I have Netflix because it's the 21st century.
5813411	5833181	all your friends at Blockbuster have you seen that onion bit where it's like a historical recreation center and it's like done up like a Blockbuster and there's like historical figures like posing as employees and stuff it's hysterical nice I love the onion yeah so Blockbuster is looks like it's on its way out of business that's kind of sad
5833829	5834609	A little bit, yeah.
5835650	5839211	More free videos available on Xbox Live and PSN, says Fascinator as well.
5840472	5842952	Let's see, Actdeft sends us a couple links here.
5843713	5848495	Actually, I guess one of them already got brought up because it's the Kirby thing, but there's another link here.
5849455	5854057	He's linking us to an article on Kotaku called How to Hump an Xbox 360.
5854717	5856918	Okay.
5858338	5862380	I guess there's a blog at HouseholdHoles.com
5865667	5866127	Wow.
5866368	5868508	They finally found a good use for the Xbox.
5868548	5874290	Has talked about how to modify your Xbox to give it a big hole.
5874390	5876051	Spoiler alert, you drill a hole in it.
5878852	5879372	Huh.
5880573	5880953	I see.
5881633	5882374	Wow.
5882394	5883536	Really, that's all the instructions.
5884197	5887041	Drill hole, add handlebar for some reason.
5888402	5889304	You gotta hold on.
5892889	5895793	I seriously want to see a YouTube video of somebody actually doing this.
5895953	5896373	I do not.
5897574	5899095	DarkKeysK sends us a tweet.
5899215	5902317	Medal of Honor PC Open Beta starts October 4th.
5902757	5910401	So if you're into the Medal of Honor games and you want to play the new PC version there, you can check this out.
5910481	5911621	It's going to be an open beta.
5912322	5918404	It's going to be an early trial for DICE Multi... What is this?
5918464	5919945	I'm looking at this website here.
5920505	5922086	It runs October 4th through 7th.
5923927	5925448	I'm trying to see how you get into this.
5928911	5929771	Oh, that's the developer.
5929811	5930131	I'm sorry.
5930151	5931672	I thought that was like a convention or something.
5931712	5933032	I've heard that used before with that.
5933412	5939653	But anyhow, yeah, a comment from... Sorry, I haven't read the story in advance.
5939673	5940454	It was coming on Twitter.
5941334	5951316	A comment from EA Games President Frank Guilbeau says, quote, We also hope that by offering the multiplayer open beta, we can clear up any misunderstanding about the patriotism and respect that...
5952257	5953958	They are the foundation of this game.
5954118	5958021	Medal of Honor franchise has always shown extraordinary reverence for American and allied soldiers.
5958461	5959902	This game is no exception.
5960823	5964046	So if you like those war games, you're going to have a blast with this one.
5964246	5964526	Get it?
5967441	5972709	TigerClaw sends his tweet, raving rabbits to become a live action CGI TV show.
5973550	5974011	Wow.
5974612	5974952	I hate them.
5975033	5976274	I hate them so much.
5977156	5979299	No, apparently it's really happening.
5979339	5981623	It's coming from Ardman Animation.
5982223	5983565	is producing the TV show.
5984887	5986388	They've got a website and everything.
5987550	5988190	Have fun with that.
5988611	5993977	TigerClaw also sends us a link that is a little more stateside about that whole Wii Remote Plus thing going on.
5994618	5996881	Apparently November 7th is the date they're looking at.
5997381	5998082	So, interesting.
6002206	6004028	DarkTsuke sent us another tweet here.
6004288	6005969	FPS vs. RTS players.
6006029	6009472	I haven't played in a while, but it's a pretty great game to unite gamers.
6009573	6013916	Battleswarm.net I don't want to visit it live on air because I don't want to break the show computer.
6013936	6017479	I don't know how intensive this site is, but I guess he's throwing out a plug for that website.
6019041	6025985	Matt, SJ100Matt is sending us a tweet saying, Remember Bobby Blackwolf's listless idea for a gun con dating sim?
6026565	6031208	Sounds like someone stole his idea and got linked to this gal gun.
6031288	6034190	It's the Xbox 360's shooter.
6035311	6035731	Wow.
6036612	6040474	Yes, it does look like a gun shooting dating game.
6040554	6041675	There's actually a little video here.
6041715	6042736	What kind of gun?
6044877	6046999	Let's see if we can look at a little clip here of the video.
6047839	6049921	Oh, so you're shooting the women that you want to date.
6050241	6050841	Oh, brilliant.
6050901	6052242	I think you're rescuing them.
6053543	6055484	With your love juices that you're shooting at them.
6058827	6061989	Oh, no, looks like you're shooting her boobies.
6062749	6065331	You're rescuing them from not having an orgasm.
6065351	6070154	You're rescuing them from their confining clothing.
6071856	6073217	Oh, you are shooting them with hearts.
6074017	6074277	and Flower.
6087791	6087831	No.
6087851	6087891	No.
6116997	6118077	That's a neat effect, though.
6118837	6120618	It's just a perspective effect.
6121218	6121498	You know what?
6121518	6124219	There's a game on the iPad that kind of does that.
6124359	6126239	It's Labyrinth or something like that.
6126279	6127400	That's just screenshots.
6127480	6128020	I've seen that.
6128800	6130400	No, that's not like what the 3DS does.
6130540	6131261	It is an app, though.
6131381	6132021	It's neat, though.
6132761	6133981	I have to share something, by the way.
6134061	6134261	What?
6134421	6135382	This comes from Tiara.
6135582	6136902	It's about WoW, so you'll like it.
6137262	6137522	Goody.
6138422	6142323	That she ran into a level 60 Tauren druid named Harry Potter.
6143043	6145304	H-A-I-R-Y-P-A-W-T-E-R.
6147208	6148349	I like that she's playing WoW again.
6149589	6150229	Come play with me.
6151430	6153770	And then lastly from Leo Shen sends us a tweet.
6153850	6157111	A new challenger approaches for BlazBlueCS2.
6157191	6162593	She has kitty missiles and links us to a little YouTube here I guess where you can see this character in action.
6163734	6165414	Come on, let's see the kitty missiles.
6165434	6165814	Might be.
6181451	6182731	Wait, did she just throw a cow?
6182991	6183652	I think she did.
6184692	6186292	I totally just saw a cow get thrown.
6186632	6187732	What is this, Monty Python?
6187853	6188393	I guess so.
6188433	6190153	All right, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
6190193	6195434	If you want to send us tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR is the place where you can follow us on Twitter.
6195734	6199795	You should follow us on Twitter anyway, so that way we can tweet you with reminders about what's coming up with the show.
6200095	6200496	Yay!
6201156	6207897	And sometimes when we go to conventions and stuff, random things we will send out on Twitter as well, like pictures and all that cool stuff.
6208457	6209618	All right, back into some more news.
6209818	6210698	Loki, what do you got for us?
6212432	6214353	I've got Plants vs. Zombies now.
6215634	6225520	I've got some cool stuff, including... You may remember some of the things that Sony does to curb piracy and stuff.
6226621	6237107	Well, now they've disabled... It's funny because everybody's joking, oh, now they have those USB mod chips, they're going to disable the USB ports.
6238733	6240454	They weren't that far off.
6240835	6248239	They've disabled some USB peripherals, I guess, according to a report that was on their website.
6248980	6260447	The issue, I guess, they were disabling counterfeit PS3 controllers, but it was actually disabling unlicensed third-party controllers.
6262189	6286049	Some of these devices affected by this actually were the Yobo PS3 Joybox, which I believe is an arcade stick, the XCM Cross Battle Plus adapter, which was kind of an adapter that allowed you to use an Xbox 360 controller on the PlayStation 3, and the Splitfish FragFX, which is kind of a hybrid controller and mouse adapter.
6286349	6288890	and that's kind of lame.
6289250	6291491	That's part of firmware 3.5.
6292451	6301774	Other things though that it kind of broke as well, some old Mad Catz controllers, even though they are fully licensed, apparently they are now broken.
6301834	6314838	So if you own the 2008 wireless PS3 gamepad or the 2008 wired PS3 gamepad or the PS3 wireless MicroCon, which is now discontinued, they do not work anymore.
6315618	6315878	Dope.
6316869	6321231	So, um... Man, if I were Mad Catz, I would be pissed.
6321531	6322191	I would be pissed.
6322251	6323531	Especially if they're licensed.
6323571	6326532	If they're unlicensed, well then, too bad, so sad, right?
6326872	6331074	But if they're licensed, that's grounds to sue and stuff.
6331934	6332695	Yeah, Sue and...
6356235	6360956	I don't know about you, but I haven't heard of some big ol' mass problem with counterfeit controllers.
6362037	6367318	I don't know people out there going, oh man, all those counterfeit controllers out there, I just can't find a good PS3 controller.
6368959	6371199	Well, there are a lot of shitty controllers out there, actually.
6371699	6374080	Yeah, but these are actually counterfeit controllers.
6374100	6381962	There was a YouTube that was on Kotaku as well, where someone actually bought a cheap DualShock 3 controller that was a counterfeit.
6383573	6404547	so you know that's kind of lame that those are out there but I mean I can't imagine this is a huge problem that one that warrants a software update I mean hell I can think of a lot of problems that this console has that haven't been fixed with a software update like home being lame nice
6405908	6409310	All right, well, how would you like to get free Microsoft Points?
6409751	6411312	That's right, free Microsoft Points.
6411332	6411812	Well, guess what?
6411832	6414834	There's a website that will bribe you with free Microsoft Points.
6415335	6418397	They're keeping it in the family because that website is Bing.
6418777	6421199	That's right, Microsoft Search Engine, the rival to Google.
6421299	6427343	Bing is running this new little Bing toolbar that you can install on your browser.
6428163	6428564	By the way...
6429704	6437310	The first announcement said that it was only compatible with Internet Explorer, but some things I've been reading in forum chats and stuff say that it actually works with Firefox.
6437630	6443534	It would make sense that it would only work with Internet Explorer, that whole Microsoft-only stuff.
6444555	6453502	But anyhow, if you use it to take part in daily promotions or do searching, you will earn reward points that you can then turn into Microsoft points.
6454142	6458446	So here's the thing though, you can only get the Microsoft points in 100 point denominations.
6458967	6462991	But just installing the tool bar gets you 250 points, so that's kind of cool I guess.
6464492	6474902	What I'm also hearing though, again reading through comments and things, is apparently they will only send you the points in cards in the mail.
6475702	6475903	Mm-hmm.
6475923	6476043	Mm-hmm.
6494600	6495981	They're trying all kinds of stuff.
6514742	6515042	DarkSakura.com
6531380	6541246	Their application on... Did it... Oh, no, did it... It made me... I was trying to click cancel and I clicked the other thing, so now it closed all my windows.
6541326	6543768	Great, and it means you closed your next story, didn't it?
6543788	6545009	Yay.
6545029	6545189	Yes.
6545969	6546730	Awesome.
6546770	6547330	Oh, well.
6548291	6548631	Oh, well.
6548751	6549312	You know what?
6549732	6551293	That's what I have an iPhone for.
6551913	6553434	You're going to bring up stories on the iPhone?
6553554	6553955	Why not?
6554195	6556096	All right, well, I got to stretch for time here.
6556136	6557377	I was ready to go on to the next story.
6557757	6558758	Well, you know what, Rob?
6558798	6560720	Sometimes things just don't go the way you expect them to.
6560860	6562141	Hey, don't be rude.
6562421	6563102	I wasn't being rude.
6563862	6564723	I'm a realist.
6564843	6566425	Bing has pretty pictures on it.
6566665	6568326	That's what I like about Bing when you go to their website.
6568606	6570888	And the iPhone app is actually kind of neat.
6570988	6571949	I don't have an iPhone.
6572089	6572330	Really?
6572370	6573290	Would you like to touch mine?
6573531	6573731	No.
6573751	6574371	I would.
6574391	6576173	It's got your finger juice on it.
6577434	6577854	Yes, you may.
6577874	6578275	Oh, my God.
6579750	6580851	Okay, I have my story.
6581331	6581651	Yay.
6581851	6582192	Alright.
6582492	6585834	Because this is the joy of the iPhone.
6586695	6587715	Oh great, now it's not loading.
6589436	6589837	Sucker.
6589917	6598902	Miyamoto, basically what the story is about is that Miyamoto has always considered the maker of the Rubik's Cube, Mr. Rubik himself, to be his rival.
6600303	6605827	So he wants to make something along the lines of a Rubik's Cube as his big pet project.
6605927	6609049	So like selling a bazillion Wii's isn't good enough?
6609690	6609830	Nope.
6612291	6622215	Well, basically, he said, and I'm going to quote, For quite some time, I have viewed Professor Rubik, who created the Rubik's Cube, as a sort of rival.
6622295	6625096	I've always thought it would be cool to create something like a Rubik's Cube.
6625617	6627157	I've told lots of people about that.
6627237	6633080	For 20 years, I've always thought that the Rubik's Cubes are great, and I wanted to make something like that, but I still haven't tried to do.
6633640	6635160	So I must be taking it easy.
6636141	6636441	Wow.
6636461	6636521	Wow.
6638385	6654564	and then he said he wanted to be a manga artist oh he just wants to do everything doesn't he you know what he's created some of the most memorable video game characters ever like that history will never forget some of these video game characters and yet it's just not good enough for him
6655071	6655251	No?
6655871	6665277	And, well, he was, um, said that he, uh, did some, uh, comic strips for, um, Tezuka, who's the Nintendo EAD general manager.
6665537	6668438	Wait, wait, what, which characters are you talking about that he created?
6668838	6672120	Um, you know, the ones that we would never forget, was that like Captain Rainbow or something?
6674181	6675442	Do you remember Captain Rainbow?
6675922	6678184	Good point from, uh, DarkTetsuya in chatroom.
6678864	6681785	Uh, didn't Nintendo used to make toys and stuff back in the 70s?
6682226	6684527	Actually, Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda card.
6684861	6685382	Game & Watch
6700703	6702786	Probably the rest of the steampunk outfit on my avatar.
6705829	6706270	All right.
6707071	6707932	Loki, it's your turn.
6708012	6710515	You got to put down plants versus zombies and actually do a story.
6710535	6711396	Sorry, I can do this.
6713138	6718244	So there's other Sony news, and this would kind of tie in with the stuff that happened.
6719125	6730390	Before, when they were removing things to stop hacking, remember they removed the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3 to stop the hacking of the system via Linux?
6730911	6736433	Well, apparently there was a class action lawsuit filed against Sony because of that.
6737254	6741956	And Sony has now filed a motion to dismiss that class action lawsuit brought against the company.
6742676	6746298	And sadly enough, I kind of agree with them because, well...
6747000	6756902	Fails to present evidence that the company overtly advertised the other OS and its marketing campaigns on the PS3 packaging
6769506	6773611	Sony also claims that the PS3 warranty license agreement and the PlayStation Network Terms of Service specifically provide
6786428	6804506	PS3 purchasers with a licensed non-ownership interest in the software and use of the PlayStation Network provided that Sony has the right to disable or alter software features or terminate or limit the access to the PlayStation Network by issuing firmware updates.
6805046	6806928	And also I guess that
6808597	6809057	Oh, gee.
6809178	6814620	So, in other words, they're saying you can access this feature by disabling a different feature instead.
6825720	6826060	Yes.
6826080	6827461	Tricky.
6827702	6840212	Also, they're saying that because some of the... They should dismiss the suit because some of the plaintiffs did not use the other OS feature.
6840712	6850760	In fact, there was... Didn't use it in the same way, I guess, or just didn't use it at all because they have ways of checking that.
6851421	6852982	And so, I guess...
6854505	6856009	They wouldn't really have been affected by it.
6856390	6859639	It's some people, I think, doing a money grab, if you ask me.
6861690	6866273	I'm sure some people are just like that earlier story we had about APB and all the people complaining to EA.
6866313	6869556	I bet there's some people that are going to go try to get money that really didn't even play APB.
6869596	6870157	They just bought it.
6870217	6871838	Well, that's different though.
6871898	6874520	I mean, they'd have proof of purchase of APB.
6874540	6877322	They'd give them the serial number or something like that and they'd approve of that.
6878043	6882646	This is a little different than saying, oh, you know, I...
6884042	6884382	I don't know.
6884422	6889144	Like, for example, a class action lawsuit that I was part of just because I hate 24 Hour Fitness.
6890285	6899089	I canceled my 24 Hour Fitness membership and there was a class action lawsuit saying that there was people affected by the fact that when you cancel your membership, they bill you a couple more times.
6900109	6900429	Really?
6900849	6901110	Yeah.
6901370	6902030	Did that happen to you?
6902350	6903090	No, it didn't happen to me.
6903451	6906112	But I still got... A $5 check?
6906192	6908413	I got a three month pass to 24 Hour Fitness.
6908453	6910214	I'm like, ooh, garbage!
6910354	6910934	Thank you!
6911374	6913015	It's like, oh, wonderful.
6913515	6917197	I can't wait to go back to the gym I don't like going to.
6917437	6917977	Thank you.
6917997	6921139	This is way better than any other compensation you could possibly provide me.
6921339	6921579	Nice.
6922479	6922879	Very nice.
6922939	6925901	At least I should be able to kick them in the pants or something.
6925941	6932464	Going to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com for such eloquent comments, such as the one from Toagak, who says, Sony can suck a dick.
6932624	6933765	What they did was wrong.
6934465	6935766	Do you agree, Rice Princess?
6935786	6936666	Can Sony suck a dick?
6938280	6948663	Derek H in our chatroom says that's like a car company removing your seatbelts because you didn't use them.
6949583	6951244	That's actually a pretty good comparison.
6951624	6955985	Except for the fact that I don't think the other OS is going to save your life.
6956385	6957185	Maybe it could.
6957406	6958986	I guess anything's possible.
6959420	6960780	Don't make assumptions, Rob.
6960800	6961881	You never know.
6964742	6968703	Alright, going on to more stories in our show here.
6969683	6973205	Another rumor going around, and this is about more 3D games.
6974325	6974965	Oh boy.
6975245	6975805	I know, right?
6975845	6977026	I'm already over it.
6978311	6986535	But apparently there are yet more rumored ports of PlayStation 2 games being remade for the PlayStation 3 and in 3D.
6987095	6988956	One of them, I've got to admit, sounds really interesting.
6988996	6991857	It's the Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection.
6992437	7001001	And if you're looking at sample box art that's out there, it's Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 kind of redone in HD.
7001641	7006744	I've got to admit, being that I love the cheesy Mortal Kombat games from back in the day, that actually sounds kind of awesome.
7006784	7007544	I'm not going to lie.
7008004	7015230	Being able to, you know, play that in 3D Well, I wouldn't play in 3D, but HD and all that jazz Not interested in Rice Princess?
7015890	7017912	Not especially You don't like Mortal Kombat?
7018252	7020594	It's alright, I can play it in it's normal form
7021352	7021953	Yes, that's true.
7023774	7032741	Apparently, it's going to have stereoscopic 3D support, and this is being reported by a French gaming website, but they have box art to go with it, and I don't know.
7032861	7033362	It's coming out.
7034583	7034723	Oh.
7036244	7037145	Well, then, I believe it.
7037385	7039326	What about the Prince of Persia trilogy 3D?
7039346	7040407	That's the other one that's being rumored.
7040427	7041288	I haven't heard about that one yet.
7041888	7043569	Only if it has video of Jake Gyllenhaal.
7043789	7049050	But I can imagine that they would because everybody's kind of jumping on that bandwagon of re-releasing stuff.
7049231	7050191	Hey, I'm okay with that.
7050251	7051511	Prince of Persia games are pretty awesome.
7051551	7054692	It's the Sands of Time, Warrior Within, and the Two Thrones all coming out.
7054792	7058233	Sounds like they'd be a perfect tie-in with the DVD release of the movie now, wouldn't it?
7058293	7058734	Wouldn't it?
7059194	7064075	And the Mortal Kombat HD collection might make the perfect companion piece to the new Mortal Kombat game, wouldn't it?
7065056	7068357	How about Jake Gyllenhaal and the oncoming something?
7068377	7068677	I don't know.
7068837	7069137	Never mind.
7071631	7074897	I try to make sex jokes around you, Robin, I just can't because I'm distracted by you.
7075137	7078403	I'm not sure how to take that, but I think it's a compliment.
7081789	7103440	Derek H says they should remake every game with parallax backgrounds in 3D that might actually happen on the 3DS actually if what we saw at I almost said Classic Gaming Expo I didn't even fucking go to that what am I thinking at E3 as any indication because you know they had like the Xevious this old old old Namco game from like the 80s was redone in 3D parallel
7104461	7107724	Yeah, they had Star Fox was redone.
7108044	7110486	They were talking about redoing Ocarina of Time.
7110846	7112788	They're going to go back and redo all these games in 3D.
7114406	7114846	Why?
7115547	7116187	You know why?
7116627	7122131	It's because they can just take the code they already have, tack on 3D, and re-release the damn game again.
7122191	7128694	Just like we can take some GameCube games, tack on Wii Remote Waggle, and re-release it.
7128834	7129275	Hey, look!
7129495	7132056	We're supporting the fans because we released lots of games this year.
7132957	7133397	New games?
7134898	7135478	Oh, I'm sorry.
7135518	7137920	That would actually be just games.
7137960	7141161	You've got to admit, a game like Pilotwings would be kind of awesome in 3D.
7142422	7145123	Like, I have to admit, okay, here's the thing though, Rice Francis, keep this in mind.
7145464	7146464	I don't like 3D either.
7146704	7152607	Like, I don't like hearing about all these movies and things that are in 3D, but the 3DS is, for some reason, is different.
7153107	7159430	Like, A, you can turn off the 3D when it bugs you because it has a slider that lets you adjust the intensity so it's easier on your eyes.
7159790	7182590	and it is kind of a neat effect I gotta say being able to see the 3D without glasses is kind of cool I don't know how long that'll last but here's something that kind of has me thinking you know for the longest time we've been wondering where are virtual console games on the DSi where are virtual console games and virtual consoles kind of slowed up lately what if a lot of these re-releases with 3D end up being downloadable games for the DSi
7182930	7186192	They're going to re-release these games all over again, but this time they're in 3D.
7186672	7191034	I mean, if the price is right, like $5, $10, it could be worth it for some of these games.
7192615	7194336	Only the real, real classics.
7194516	7197518	I wouldn't buy games like Princess Tomato and Salad Kingdom or whatever.
7197658	7198779	What are you talking about?
7198799	7199359	That is a real classic.
7199379	7200420	That's my favorite game ever.
7200440	7200940	Oh, shut up.
7202341	7204282	You wouldn't want to play Clash and Demon Head in 3D?
7204502	7207203	No, you're fixing something that's not broken.
7207603	7209284	I don't know, it's not worth it to me.
7209324	7210845	Why would I pay for it again?
7211585	7213666	You know, it was fine how it was before.
7213826	7218248	And you know, if I want 3D, I'll just go into real life.
7219248	7221870	I hear they have 3D in real life.
7221950	7223410	Apparently, yes, they do.
7223570	7225171	So, I mean, I don't know.
7225811	7226832	I'm just not down with the 3D.
7227819	7228279	Outro Outro
7248271	7250313	at the naked woman in the window.
7269409	7292733	but some of it here's the thing but then some of the 3D effects what they do is they put the main image on the very very back plane so that way when there's 3D effects it does look like things are coming forward because they'll put the static image on the very last plane in the very back and then things are shooting out like there was one little demo they were showing out on the floor that was somebody opening a champagne bottle in slow motion and the champagne goes everywhere and
7292953	7294614	Well, it's just to show off the technology.
7294854	7300778	Yeah, like, all I think of when I think of that is just Nintendo saying, we're Nintendo.
7301258	7302179	Give me your money.
7302699	7303659	Give me your money.
7303739	7305260	And people give them their money.
7305360	7305881	I know.
7306381	7307682	They're still the number one console.
7307722	7315747	And I'm just worried that when this gimmick fades like it will, that the 3DS, I mean, which, you know, you'd hope that it would be around for a few years, but it's just going to die.
7315967	7318148	Every seven-year-old is going to want one.
7318488	7321050	every single 7 year old on the planet is going on well we'll see
7340715	7345116	Again, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and there are a lot of very promising developers hopping in on it.
7345637	7356900	Although, again, it's portable gaming, and I'm not always the biggest fan of portable games, but if it can give me something that the television games can't, 3D in this case, might be worth a look.
7356940	7357280	I don't know.
7358641	7361802	If it has really, really, really great games that necessitate it, I'm going to have to go.
7362435	7364317	Well, you can go ahead and spend your money.
7364457	7365058	I'm poor.
7366480	7368622	I'm just going to have to go buy a Virtual Boy.
7368682	7370184	You can always steal one.
7370845	7372126	Oh my God, that's a great idea.
7372146	7373648	I'll be over at your house soon.
7373748	7375130	We're both going to steal yours, Rob.
7375690	7376491	No, bad idea.
7376551	7376912	Never mind.
7376952	7377573	Forget I said that.
7377693	7378774	Ha ha, it's your fault.
7378934	7380475	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
7380796	7382157	Every week you guys send us emails.
7382217	7390964	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna open up the email bag, dive in head first, try not to drown under the massive emails that are in there.
7391724	7394526	Try not to inhale any of the anthrax that comes with the messages.
7395787	7396688	And read a few for you.
7399230	7401932	Alright, this one is from LabratY2K.
7402533	7404694	I just finished a journey into my own gaming vault.
7404734	7408897	This trip had me play Earthbound Mother in Japan for the SNES for the first time.
7409378	7411740	It's like they read Rice Princess's mind.
7411820	7412540	I know.
7412700	7414562	I can't speak highly enough of this game.
7414662	7417824	It had a great story and I found that I actually cared about the NPCs.
7418365	7419966	Additionally, I truly enjoyed the humor.
7420406	7423929	This is something that's been missing from most of the recent JRPGs.
7424609	7447272	if you haven't covered this on your retro gaming segment it would definitely be worth consideration Labrat Y2K I concur well now if you don't play it all the way to the very very end where you actually beat it then be careful because Rise Princess will make fun of you for the rest of your life so you better play it to completion it's true don't just play the first town like Rob did I played at least four towns
7448430	7449812	Are you sure about that?
7450532	7451974	I had a full party of people.
7452074	7454997	Like, you don't get that until, like, practically halfway through the game.
7456799	7458721	Stop laughing at me, you bitch!
7460223	7461585	Greetings again from Rababa.
7463813	7491105	I have been hoping and waiting for Verizon to get an iPhone contract because I'm shopping for a phone keep on waiting let's imagine that if it became reality I have some pretty good reasons to believe that apps that use the network for gaming or social networking will not work between AT&T and Verizon the only ones that will are the ones that push and pull things via the internet like Facebook or Twitter app I think this will be an eye-opening disappointment I hope I'm wrong imagine iPhones with babies
7494054	7496625	I'm not sure I follow the logic there, why they wouldn't work.
7497523	7498884	Next email.
7498944	7499044	Hey.
7528711	7533533	With the Plants vs. Zombies talk on the last show, it brings to focus my addiction to the game on Steam.
7533953	7536094	Looking over my playtime is almost depressing.
7536254	7537254	Portal, 2 hours.
7537334	7541516	Half-Life 2, one of the best first-person shooters made, 44 minutes.
7541876	7543296	Team Fortress 2, 2 hours.
7543376	7544437	Torchlight, 8 hours.
7544517	7546798	Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition, 40 hours.
7548238	7548558	Wow.
7548618	7552139	Hopefully, I'll have the chance to give the other games the playtime they deserve.
7552199	7559541	In the meantime, I'm really hoping that next year's Plants vs. Zombies DS game will feature the multiplayer elements of the 360 release.
7559901	7564522	Keep podcasting and stay something.
7564882	7568183	Robert M. It's like the listeners are reading our minds this week.
7568823	7574004	Plants vs. Zombies, everybody's talking about how they've been playing that, even though that game's a good year too old at this point.
7574545	7576125	It's because you're psychic, Rob.
7576806	7577226	Shut up.
7578366	7579106	No, no, no.
7579226	7579466	Okay.
7579606	7580486	Greetings, OLR.
7580566	7583187	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle here.
7583847	7586228	I just wanted to thank you so much for the marathon show.
7586268	7589849	I actually listened to the entire podcast in one long day of work.
7590409	7591489	I was worn out after that.
7591689	7599291	Anywho, I think the idea of BlizzCon is stupid, but is anyone besides me pulling out their hair while waiting for any news about Diablo 3?
7600151	7607519	Back in the day of Diablo 2, I never used any form of voiceover IP and still spent hundreds of hours playing it.
7607939	7611042	I can't imagine the addiction this time around.
7611423	7617649	Keep up the great work on the best structured, most informational, and best podcast running on the internet tubes.
7618150	7621433	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.
7622674	7624075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7646849	7648370	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
7673013	7674374	Yes, it's because I'm not Korean.
7676815	7677575	Can I read?
7678076	7678336	No.
7679036	7679816	I'm reading it anyway.
7680737	7685559	Dear OLR, I was listening to Loki's feltastic apple metaphor and thought I'd take a crack at it.
7686480	7689361	So I went to take me and a bunch of my friends out to a restaurant.
7689501	7694043	I could just get takeout and have a party at home, but I like the experience that comes with dining out.
7694423	7696304	Also, I don't want my house getting trashed.
7696704	7701827	So I treat my friends to dinner at a semi-fine restaurant, paying for the entire meal because I'm a nerd with a full-time job.
7702347	7709109	The restaurant presumably includes the cost of the dining experience, waiters, dishes, silverware, bad music, random crap on the walls, etc.
7710069	7715410	End with the cost of the meal, because if people saw what this actually costs, they might not choose to enjoy the dining experience.
7716030	7718771	This cost comes to me because I'm the one paying.
7719171	7729294	However, if the restaurant is an establishment that makes each individual person pay for their own dining experience, and I'm not going to stand out in front of a restaurant and yell, FUCK YOU AND FUCK YOUR FUCKING DINING FEE!
7730274	7734236	Instead, I will give my business to a different restaurant that doesn't charge outrageous dining fees.
7734656	7737337	That, ladies and gentlemen, is how to craft a metaphor.
7737917	7739118	Stay black, Red Entertainment.
7739618	7743239	This message was brought to you by 2x plus 2y minus 8 equals 4y.
7743559	7747501	Solve for x. The answer, by the way, is x equals y plus 4.
7747881	7748101	Sorry.
7748541	7750042	None of us are black.
7751198	7753599	You weren't here when that happened.
7754560	7760884	We had a caller on the show and Dan was just like, at the end, there was that awkward silence and Dan was like, alright, stay black, have a good week.
7760924	7762164	And we were just like, what?
7762245	7763565	Now I will explain my answer.
7764106	7766127	Okay.
7766247	7768388	2x plus 2y minus x equals 4y.
7768608	7770229	Subtract 2y from one side.
7770269	7770770	Who cares?
7772290	7773191	Obviously, Jamie.
7774045	7774405	I know.
7774606	7776908	She just wants to show off her algebra skills.
7777008	7781171	No, it's because I have these numbers running through my brain all the time now, stupid algebra.
7782112	7786456	Okay, I want to go back to the metaphor because it didn't really make any sense to me at all, but I like the story.
7786536	7787277	Cool story, bro.
7788358	7788878	Stay black.
7791400	7791741	Okay.
7793742	7794083	Alright.
7794505	7796286	Well, is that it for the mailbag or do we have more emails?
7796646	7797487	That's all I'm going to read.
7799628	7802009	Well, if you didn't get your email read, how sad for you.
7802169	7802629	Try again.
7802689	7808752	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you should put at the top, like, DarkSakura, read this or I'll send you more math.
7809453	7810753	That's how you get her to read more emails.
7811474	7812134	Threaten her with math.
7812154	7812874	Did you say send me meth?
7813314	7814015	No, math.
7814255	7815436	Because I could use the meth.
7816656	7816956	Oh, my.
7817136	7817677	I'm tired.
7817697	7818757	She has to party all night.
7818857	7819177	All right.
7820138	7822259	Now's the part of the show where we get angsty.
7822699	7824120	FU's of the Week.
7838394	7862500	I would like to say an F you to Pollen and... I'd give an F you to people that are too slow to finish a transaction.
7864580	7865701	You know who I'm talking about.
7866981	7867241	Person.
7869585	7870905	I'm trying to buy something for somebody.
7870925	7874907	I paid them and now they're like, oh, I'm really busy right now.
7875327	7875847	Yeah.
7876427	7876807	That's all right.
7876827	7880229	I guess I'll talk shit about them if they don't come through on their end.
7881009	7883410	Good idea.
7883670	7887771	F you to the fact that I'm having pains in my tooth like three days before I'm supposed to go to Disneyland.
7887811	7891832	And it's like, I really don't want to go to the dentist right now because it's going to be so expensive.
7893433	7895794	So I'm going to be taking a big old box of oral gel with me.
7895814	7896594	Good times.
7897472	7899675	F you to licorice Black licorice specifically
7906243	7907804	Yeah, F you to black licorice.
7909285	7910065	Like I just said.
7910326	7911566	Are you licorice racist?
7914388	7915849	You just hate all licorice equally.
7916049	7919852	I don't prefer to hang around black licorice, okay?
7919892	7921293	I don't hate it.
7921373	7923634	That's okay, because I hate all licorice equally.
7924435	7925155	I like red licorice.
7925495	7926176	Also, F you to 3D.
7928397	7929518	and The Doctor, lastly.
7930279	7932000	F you to money, because I want more of it.
7932080	7933301	I don't have any right now.
7934022	7934162	Aww.
7935083	7937445	But like, you live in the middle of nowhere where rent is like $20.
7937845	7938205	I know.
7938285	7939486	Don't you even have a roommate now?
7939726	7940907	No, I don't have a roommate anymore.
7941007	7941568	Oh, I thought you did.
7941588	7942288	Yeah, that ship sailed.
7942469	7942749	Uh-oh.
7942869	7943289	What happened?
7943329	7943730	Was it bad?
7944530	7945471	It sailed.
7945571	7946172	We'll talk later.
7946892	7948093	Uh-oh.
7948113	7948954	You're my roommate now.
7949714	7950435	Woo-hoo!
7950455	7951136	House party!
7951196	7951796	Yay!
7951836	7952697	In the middle of nowhere.
7953838	7954158	Oops!
7954218	7955739	Prank party!
7956060	7956280	Oops!
7956340	7957621	Prank party with Rob!
7958911	7960854	Ship sailed, okay?
7960915	7961976	Some comments from chat room.
7962036	7964381	Ranma says, Hey, I'm black and I hate black licorice too.
7964801	7966785	And Derek H is calling you a licoracist.
7970663	7974566	Oh, wow.
7976307	7976607	All right.
7978068	7985393	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line is going to be open at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.
7985413	7987154	But not yet, because we have two more stories to go.
7987675	7988175	Loki.
7988215	7988455	Yes.
7989035	7991157	I just want people to get their dialing fingers ready.
7991417	7992438	They're dialing fingers.
7992839	7995321	It's like playing Flamin' Finger at Dave & Buster's.
7995341	7997884	Someone's sitting by their phone like, oh, I'm waiting for them to turn on.
7997944	7998484	I'm waiting.
7998925	7999966	I'm waiting.
8000126	8008835	Microsoft, getting a taste of money because of Halo Reach, has decided, you know what, maybe one Halo game every three years.
8009376	8010417	Not frequent enough.
8010497	8011558	We need to be putting out
8012170	8013170	More Halo games.
8013250	8020553	And they're saying, you know, probably, I guess, Phil Spencer, this is Microsoft's VP.
8021333	8027115	They're saying it's a matter of keeping players engaged and not going dark for two years at a time.
8028015	8033617	They want to do what Activision has done with Call of Duty, which is whore that bitch out like no other.
8035642	8042548	Um, and they said, I used to look at annual releases of non-sports games as people just like, uh, just trying to milk me.
8043369	8049254	Uh, I figured nobody had enough time to do a good job and all the negatives that would associate with those kinds of scenarios.
8049655	8055160	Kudos to Activision because they've done a good job putting good game, um, continuing to release each year.
8055640	8060424	I think the fans, um, like it and it's a good thing that they do it that way.
8061745	8061826	Um,
8062952	8065693	That's because they had two different developers working on it.
8067214	8069095	I don't know if that's going to work with Halo.
8071576	8075998	Do you think that Halo is just going to go really downhill now that a different studio is going to be developing it?
8076398	8077719	Oh, yeah.
8077739	8080440	Especially if it sounds like they're going to try to crank them out as fast as possible.
8080520	8081680	That sounds dangerous.
8081720	8086703	Just do not put Ruffian Games on Halo because they really fucked up Crackdown 2.
8086743	8086783	Um...
8090973	8093975	Do you think they're going to try and crank out a Halo game again as early as next year?
8095456	8097738	Because if that's the case, then somebody's already working on it.
8099042	8100603	I don't know, we'll have to see.
8101744	8118073	It's just going to get to the point though, see with Call of Duty even, you know, Modern Warfare was really awesome and then Modern Warfare 2 was still very awesome and World at War that came out in between that was just kind of like, eh, it's alright, but still people went and played the one game.
8118353	8122496	So people aren't necessarily buying every year's iteration of the game.
8123476	8144104	and that's also another thing that's really hard to do when you're putting out a really good multiplayer game is like Halo Reach for example people will be playing Halo Reach until the next Halo game comes out but if it keeps coming out each year and if some of them happen to suck or maybe are made by Treyarch then people might not give a shit anymore
8147637	8151440	I hope they don't take a respectable name and really drive it into the ground.
8151480	8152340	But then again, you know what?
8152360	8152861	Silent Hill.
8153141	8155522	Fresh Blood isn't always a bad thing.
8155802	8156743	It could be cool.
8157103	8158104	Just most of the time.
8158424	8161866	It could be cool, but the thing is, Microsoft, they need more franchises.
8164147	8166849	Fable's a great game, I guess.
8167269	8171752	I fucking hate Peeler and Molyneux so much.
8172432	8172732	Why?
8173113	8174655	He's such a prick.
8175315	8175996	Seriously.
8176356	8177598	Our game is so awesome.
8177638	8179400	It does all these things that other games don't do.
8179700	8181202	You're going to really care for this dog.
8181402	8184566	Really, I cared so much that I stopped playing months ago.
8185827	8187209	This dog is going to become your life.
8187849	8188730	No, he's annoying.
8189251	8191153	He's like, hey, dig here, there's treasure here.
8191213	8192895	Dig here, dig here, dig here, there's treasure here.
8194315	8196256	You can raise your family and it's so wonderful.
8196316	8200857	This time, you're going to be able to be the king or queen of your kingdom.
8200897	8203038	You're going to have to run it and things are going to happen.
8203058	8205678	You're going to have your dog still because everybody loves a dog.
8206579	8208659	And it's really amazing.
8208679	8213301	And we're going to do this Project Milo shit that's going to be so wonderful.
8213441	8216762	You're going to interact with this kid like you're interacting with a real kid.
8217262	8218122	Don't play with your kids!
8218542	8221503	Your kids can interact with this kid just like they're interacting with real friends.
8222103	8251049	because they don't have real friends aww he's just so annoying with his like new technology and shit I'm sorry like here's the thing he comes out saying that these games are going to be so much more incredible than the last game because of all these reasons and they're like nearly identical to the last year's release it's like what happened to all this innovation that you're going to put in there because this game is kind of terrible
8252163	8262587	and why don't we go back to the original Scrap Milo because yeah, that's stupid and creepy and we can do the we'll get an adult guy, an adult woman and then integrate porn into the games.
8262967	8273212	I'm glad that they were able to show off this wonderful tech demo where they can interact with a child and stuff but like, if you actually heard about what the game was supposed to be about it was stupid.
8273712	8280995	It was just like, oh you interact with this child and you help him find snails because he's moved here from Isn't that Connectimals?
8282055	8283636	No, no, no, this is a child.
8283896	8285637	Okay, it's not connected humans, okay?
8285737	8287097	It's a child.
8287477	8288478	It's a real boy.
8289078	8292159	Like Pinocchio, he wants to be a real boy, but he's just digital.
8292800	8302644	And you interact with him, you help him find snails, because he's just so depressed from flying here from, I think he was coming from Britain or something like that, somewhere in England.
8302924	8303725	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8327666	8331027	It's not a British accent, it's a Peter Molyneux accent, that's how he talks.
8331047	8334047	Dark Tetsuya says, well, I think Loki's British accent beats Rob's.
8334848	8337308	I'm not trying to sound British, I'm trying to sound like Peter Molyneux.
8337328	8341669	Hello, I'm Mel B, and today we're going to be talking about Fable.
8342069	8344110	Rob, that's bloody awful, bloody awful.
8344170	8346110	What are you trying to do?
8346690	8350731	Also, buy my new game, Mel B. Blah, blah, blah, girl power.
8350971	8352891	Let's put another girl through her paces.
8352971	8353091	Jeez.
8355652	8360296	It's like, you know, I remember when he was pimping out Halo, or not Halo, yeah, he was pimping out Halo.
8360997	8361578	Milo in there.
8363199	8368924	He was pimping out fucking Fable 2 and he's like, oh no, I'm going to show you something very innovative.
8369545	8370085	It's a ball.
8371146	8373648	You play fetch with the dog.
8374489	8375050	With the ball.
8376149	8378330	It's like, I can fucking do that now.
8379490	8380230	With my dog.
8380530	8382691	I don't have a dog, I can throw a ball at my cat.
8383351	8391833	And it's way more entertaining than playing... Who seriously is gonna go into Halo and play fetch with your fucking dog for hours on end?
8392033	8395394	Is this what I'm really paying money for, is to play fetch with my fucking dog?
8396494	8417267	granted it was fun killing people or like torturing them in this little like you know device you can sacrifice in the devil you can kill people in real life you act like it's impossible it's entirely possible we have salacious pop in chat says that this is Loki right now actually this is Loki right now
8423827	8429309	I apologize that that was very low volume.
8429349	8430089	Blame YouTube.
8430629	8437552	I bet you anything, though, that Fable 3 is gonna be very, very, very, very, very similar to Fable 2.
8454898	8457720	Oh, yay, DarkSakura's finally giving me back my Clue DVD.
8457760	8459541	It's only been two years since she's had it.
8459901	8461262	No, Rob, it's been longer.
8461502	8462943	It feels like you have like three movies in here.
8462963	8463643	Oh, I love Clue.
8463983	8464404	Me too.
8464444	8465564	I'm going to watch this when I get home.
8465964	8466345	No, I'm not.
8466365	8466945	I'm going to play WoW.
8467505	8467705	All right.
8468766	8469446	Oh, Rob.
8470947	8471768	Don't joke with us.
8472048	8474149	All right, can I do one more story, then we can open up the Skype line?
8474249	8474629	Sure.
8474789	8476671	All right, Nintendo will sue.
8477351	8479132	At least that's what they've been doing this week.
8479512	8480092	Threatening to do.
8480693	8485716	They've been threatening Pokemon fan sites who have been posting Pokemon black and white screenshots.
8486116	8491779	The game came out in Japan, and of course, folks have been importing it and have been posting screenshots of it on their fan sites.
8492239	8496942	But Nintendo has brought down the legal hammer of justice with a cease and desist saying, quote,
8497242	8516772	while Nintendo appreciates your interest in and support of the Pokemon game series your publication of this content infringes Nintendo's copyrights in violation of federal law your activity also has the potential to cause substantial damage to Nintendo and leaves Nintendo with no choice but to take steps to protect its intellectual property rights some of the sites that were hit PokerBeach PokerBeach?
8517032	8525636	I don't know PokerBeach.com all your Pokemon I don't know if that's one of the names of the Pokemon Suribee or something
8526597	8547334	and of course they're very upset and this is awesome because Nintendo is so epically horrible at advertising their own stuff now yes they're going to get pissed off apparently when other people actually try to advertise for them like that's amazing it's also kind of disturbing to me that it's like well the game's out somewhere but hold on because there was an update that came out to this that might kind of shed a little light on it
8548155	8565268	and it was some various commenters on websites were kind of noticing that the sites that got shut down were admitting to using ROMs to get the screens so maybe the problem wasn't that they were posting screenshots but it's admitting how they did it by getting ROMs of an import game
8566369	8569671	I mean, still, screenshots are just screenshots and the game is already out.
8569791	8572653	But, you know, if you're going to go around openly saying, I stole the game.
8573173	8578536	What if I said, you know, I wished upon a magic lamp and the genie granted me this copy of the game?
8579176	8581217	Are they going to shut down my Pokemon site now?
8581358	8582978	Well, then, maybe.
8583339	8583699	I don't know.
8584042	8587263	I mean, I could say that it fell from the sky in a blaze of glory.
8587403	8590484	Or you just don't say how you got the screenshots at all.
8590544	8591464	You just post them.
8591524	8593024	I mean, isn't that what most websites do?
8593264	8594625	But Rob, that would be logical and sensible.
8594645	8596245	They get their exclusive report.
8596285	8597485	We got an exclusive on Pokemon.
8597505	8598826	But someone photoshopped those.
8598846	8599826	Those are photoshopped.
8599866	8601967	I don't believe that Pokemon has that in there.
8602007	8607128	Well, also keep in mind that the DSi version was region locked.
8610889	8611390	Black and White.
8611410	8612490	I almost said Black and Blue.
8612630	8613771	It's the Pokemon bruise.
8614311	8615372	Y'all know Shane, right?
8615452	8616553	He's been on the show a few times.
8616693	8619375	He's playing Pokemon Black and White right now on his Japanese DS.
8619995	8621536	Yeah.
8622016	8624138	It's the XL.
8625058	8627460	He's playing it on an older one that isn't region locked.
8627480	8630161	Because only the newer ones are region locked, so he has an old DS.
8630181	8631422	So it's not a Japanese DS, but it's an old one.
8631442	8632403	I thought he was playing it on his XL.
8632663	8632983	I don't know.
8633023	8634584	He's playing it one way or another.
8635425	8637046	That's all he ever posts about on Facebook anymore.
8637626	8638567	Seriously.
8638807	8639807	Just Pokemans.
8639867	8641028	Let him tweet it to you.
8641048	8644230	And if you're listening, call in so we can get a review on Pokemon Black and White.
8644470	8646791	Although all he's going to say, he's going to say, it's awesome.
8647351	8647631	Why?
8647651	8648912	Because it's awesome.
8649432	8649612	Why?
8649632	8651473	Because it's Pokemon and they're awesome.
8651573	8652574	Well, there's the review.
8652634	8654275	That's going to be it right there.
8654295	8655475	Now we don't need you to call in.
8655535	8658677	Because Shane loves his Pokemans.
8659057	8659838	I know, I know.
8660118	8661298	Let him tweet them to you.
8661518	8661839	Alright.
8663297	8664638	Shall we open up the Skype line?
8664898	8665298	Do it!
8665558	8666879	Let's do it!
8667319	8669460	Here's that commercial I was referring to earlier.
8669560	8677463	I've seen this commercial on real television.
8681885	8683766	Pick up the phone and call us now.
8686799	8690460	1-877-GAME-OLR I should do this every week.
8690721	8695542	I used to only see those when I would watch USA Up all night.
8695802	8697303	I remember that.
8697463	8698843	Pick up the phone.
8698903	8699603	Call us right now.
8699623	8703345	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8703805	8705425	Does the doctor want to do the calls tonight?
8706065	8706606	You want to do the call?
8706966	8707306	Sure.
8707346	8708286	That's brilliant.
8708386	8710327	Alright, the doctor's going to do the calls tonight.
8711167	8711647	Okay, good.
8711747	8712808	Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
8712968	8713288	All right.
8713348	8713808	We're waiting.
8713828	8714829	We're just waiting for the calls to come in.
8714869	8715109	Okay.
8715329	8717871	Are there any calls?
8718191	8718911	No, no one's calling.
8719051	8719511	All right.
8719791	8724494	There's a little delay between when we say things and when it goes out on all games and all that.
8724514	8726495	So can I sit on your lap while I'm doing this?
8726535	8727195	Do you really want to?
8727335	8727495	No.
8727876	8728116	Okay.
8728136	8731858	I love how your legs spread open.
8731878	8732758	You're like, you want to?
8734559	8735700	You make it sound nasty.
8735780	8736220	No.
8736680	8738381	His legs are crossed and then he opened them wide.
8739699	8739959	Sorry.
8740239	8741340	I have a wide stance.
8741460	8746702	Oh, Rob's network's open and ready for business.
8747362	8748923	Okay, again, you're disgusting.
8748943	8752645	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8753645	8756126	Some nights we get hammerwood calls, some nights we don't get calls at all.
8756186	8756747	It's my fault.
8756987	8759408	I should have had the woman answering the phone.
8759548	8760909	Hey, Rice Princess, what do you think?
8761349	8764750	Too busy in the kitchen baking things.
8765691	8768472	By the way, Alan's listening right now and you just said, OMG, hot.
8771223	8772544	DJ Hero 2 Tracklist
8793444	8801369	Um, so the Prodigy, they're going to have a mashup, I guess just a, uh, beat juggle of Firestarter, which will be pretty awesome.
8801389	8804351	Um, let's see here.
8805751	8810254	The Chemical Brothers featuring Q-Tip, uh, Galvanize mixed with the Chemical Brothers Leave Home.
8811094	8811755	Might be neat.
8812395	8817098	Um, Pussycat Dolls with Busta Rhymes, Doncha mixed with, uh, Pitbull, I Know You Want Me.
8818769	8821611	I know you want me I know I want ya
8836099	8837501	Yeah, that full list is out there right now.

8844469	8847572	Ooh, the Omen mixed with Orbital the Box.
8848253	8850315	That's from Prodigy as well.
8851637	8853279	That's going to be done by the Scratch Perverts.
8855518	8856659	and Lady Gaga.
8856679	8861961	Bad Romance is going to have a beat juggle done by Tiesto, which would be pretty cool.
8862741	8866403	Love Lockdown by Kanye West mixed with Metallica's The Day That Never Comes.
8868844	8872686	And Nucleus, jam on it with DJ Qbert on the vocals.

8876963	8878264	So yeah, that full list is out there.
8878324	8879065	Definitely check it out.
8880045	8886250	Last one I was going to mention here, Naughty by Nature, OPP mixed with Michael Jackson or with the Jackson 5 ABC.
8888112	8888492	Interesting.
8892655	8893516	This is strange.
8893556	8894456	Like nobody's calling.
8894537	8896258	Oh, of course, the minute I say that, there it goes.
8896278	8896718	The lights up.
8896838	8897799	Wait, did the doctor go away?
8897819	8899060	He had to go, Connie.
8899100	8899380	I'll enter.
8899420	8899801	I'll enter.
8899921	8901182	Okay, DarkSakura, that's all you.
8902763	8905125	Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8905185	8906025	Thank you for calling.
8906125	8906666	Who is this?
8909275	8913196	Hi, I'm calling you because I'm a very big fan of the show.
8913216	8916117	We can hear you in the bathroom, dude.
8916237	8917417	I want to speak with Rob.
8918958	8919778	How can I help you?
8921879	8926500	Oh, I don't know how you can help me, but maybe we can talk later about video games?
8927180	8928661	Why don't we talk now about video games?
8928681	8930481	You did call into a video game talk show after all.
8932122	8934422	Oh, well, I don't know.
8934482	8935123	Maybe later.
8935563	8936063	Bye-bye.
8936550	8941513	This is the worst 30 seconds of radio I've ever had in the... How long have we been doing this show, DarkSakura?
8941533	8942374	About eight and a half years?
8942934	8944915	That was the worst 30 seconds of the show.
8945575	8949118	I think in the entire... That's saying something.
8949238	8950298	What did I miss?
8950839	8952179	Oh, I don't know.
8954321	8957443	You missed somebody testing the phone to make sure it works, clearly.
8960965	8962806	Nobody wants to talk to us.
8963419	8970968	It's so funny how some weeks the phone will be ringing off the hook like we can't get enough of the calls in and then tonight it's just chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, crickets.
8972290	8974291	Did I say something to make you mad?
8975611	8976011	Listeners?
8976251	8977131	You know what we should do?
8977211	8980052	We should speak in British accents until someone calls.
8980092	8981512	And that'll force someone to call.
8981712	8983613	Oh, we'll have a jolly old time.
8983633	8984773	Oh, good lord.
8984813	8985993	That's an amazing idea.
8986013	8988514	Perhaps we could nibble on some tea and crumpets.
8988694	8990634	Oh, I'd love to nibble on your tea and crumpets.
8991354	8992595	How do you nibble on tea?
8992895	8993455	All right, Loki.
8995077	8999240	They have made deep fried beer, so maybe they'll have deep fried tea.
9001922	9002663	The phone's ringing.
9002923	9003763	Doctor, are you answering?
9003783	9004304	Who's answering?
9004364	9005084	Oh, yeah, sure.
9005124	9005445	Here we go.
9006225	9008006	Hi, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
9008547	9009067	What's your name?
9009888	9010648	My name is Ranma.
9010668	9011208	What's up, dude?
9011489	9011829	Not much.
9011849	9012489	How are you doing today?
9013430	9013970	I'm alright.
9014010	9017433	My back is killing me from an epic weekend, but other than that... Right on, right on.
9017473	9018253	As long as it was epic.
9018734	9019574	So what's on your mind?
9019694	9021476	It was an awesome barbecue fest I went to.
9021636	9022056	Sweet!
9023103	9023583	Definitely.
9023823	9025084	Did you hurt your back from fucking?
9026424	9026724	What?
9026764	9029005	Yeah, but you were complaining though, were you not?
9031165	9032425	So what's on your mind, caller?
9033166	9034706	Dude, I want to bitch about Mad Catz.
9034966	9036346	Okay, go ahead.
9036907	9039107	They need to stop making controllers, simple as that.
9039447	9041828	Their stuff falls apart within like two, three months.
9041868	9042708	Yeah, that would suck.
9042728	9048310	Yeah, because I bought a pair of cymbals for my rock band drum set.
9048590	9049950	They stopped working within three months.
9051059	9051940	Are they pretty cheap, though?
9051980	9053360	I mean, is it like you get what you pay for?
9055381	9056142	Something like that.
9056182	9061304	I mean, I got them replaced, and I use them sparingly, and they're starting to act up a little bit here and there.
9062245	9068248	Well, they have updated them for the Rock Band 3 drum set since they're actually included with that now, and they're supposed to be more sensitive.
9068588	9069548	When's Rock Band 3 out?
9069588	9070689	I want to play it so bad.
9071349	9072250	A few more weeks.
9073490	9075071	It's like the 16th or something.
9075091	9075131	Oh.
9077659	9080043	Wait, I'm getting a comment from Rice Princess here in the background.
9080063	9080804	What's that, Rice Princess?
9081485	9084069	I was just saying that Ranma was a piece of sexual chocolate.
9085792	9087915	Thank you, my dear, and I love you too.
9090138	9091019	Doctor and Rice Princess
9112740	9113721	Yay, I want to do it.
9113881	9117023	I tried to get my friend Victoria to do it, but she's kind of being flaky flake on it.
9117123	9118084	No, I would definitely do that.
9118244	9118604	Would you?
9118644	9119324	Yeah, oh heck yeah.
9119364	9120265	But we have to dress up.
9120505	9120765	Okay.
9120785	9121346	Like eccentric rock stars.
9121366	9121786	Heck yeah.
9122847	9123407	Let's do it.
9123527	9124508	DarkSakura, we need a fourth.
9124528	9124848	Let's do it.
9125128	9126289	We need a fourth, DarkSakura.
9126509	9128651	What would I do with my broken hand?
9129051	9129771	Oh, you can't do drums?
9130112	9133594	Oh my God, it'll be like fucking Monocle all over again.
9133734	9134935	You can do interpretive dance.
9135856	9136196	Okay.
9136836	9139019	See, that is not... We can't use Beatles rock bands.
9139079	9140060	Then we could have harmony.
9140380	9144024	You have to rock star sing.
9146366	9146826	Exactly.
9146846	9147547	There you go.
9147727	9149209	Someone stepped on your toe.
9150670	9152432	Or they shot her toe.
9152973	9154314	I was just grimacing musically.
9155146	9156147	Okay, good stuff.
9156568	9157730	I think this is going to have to happen.
9157790	9159472	I agree.
9159492	9160393	What do you think, Ranma?
9160694	9163337	You have to get on stage and sing in front of hundreds of people.
9163377	9163678	What's that?
9164959	9165800	I said I'm all for it.
9166021	9166621	Awesome, awesome.
9166922	9168764	I have to get over my stage fright now.
9169305	9169966	You'll be fine.
9170747	9174130	Just put a paper bag on your head and cut out little seats.
9174190	9176852	Like in Guitar Hero.
9177253	9177813	Guitar Freaks.
9177833	9179495	You can put a bucket of chicken thing on your head.
9179955	9183899	No, because then I'd have to play guitar like Buckethead.
9183959	9184399	There you go.
9184459	9189724	No, I'm talking, you know, like the little icon guys from... Guitar Freaks.
9189744	9192847	You know, that game that was made by Konami.
9192867	9193988	That could be our band name.
9194028	9195229	Guitar Freaks was first.
9197671	9200135	Well, if you want, I give you permission to use my band name.
9200255	9200655	What's that?
9201597	9202318	Rhythm and Juice.
9207290	9208852	Rama, Jews have no rhythm.
9209072	9209533	Come on.
9209553	9213737	Oh, shush.
9213958	9214618	Hugs and kicks.
9214638	9215079	Come on.
9215880	9216741	I tease because I love.
9216781	9221926	Tiara suggested that I could play with one arm like the drummer for Def Leppard.
9222027	9227493	Actually, that's an amazing idea because what you should do, you should do that whole thing where you put your hand through your shirt so it looks like you don't have an arm.
9228940	9229700	and DarkSakura.com
9248084	9249105	I would rather sing.
9250366	9252388	It was a good idea at the time.
9252989	9253489	I know, right?
9254050	9256292	We'll just get DarkSakura good and drunk before she goes on stage.
9256612	9258874	If you get me drunk, I won't be able to sing.
9259095	9259675	Why get her drunk?
9259695	9260896	Just bribe her with Guinness.
9260956	9261477	That'll work.
9261617	9262638	Here's the best part, guys.
9262658	9263559	Guinness doesn't get me drunk.
9263579	9267282	They stream Umlaut on the internet so all of you could watch.
9269024	9269745	Never mind.
9270786	9272007	I'll get the recorder ready.
9272207	9272688	I know.
9272708	9272988	Be good.
9274432	9277194	Actdeft suggests instrument freaks or band freaks.
9279255	9280656	Sax maniacs!
9280696	9286780	Which is great because there's people from Harmonix that actually go to the event and it would be extremely offensive if we named it.
9286820	9290563	Although I don't want to offend the people at Harmonix because they're wonderful people, but it would be funny.
9291823	9293164	Could be freaky guitarists.
9293244	9294025	We could be the 573s.
9294145	9294205	No.
9294305	9300009	Rob, why aren't you thinking of this?
9300029	9301209	We could be the Spice Girls.
9301229	9301850	What?
9302748	9303929	We could dress up as Spice Girls.
9304129	9305750	More like the Shice Girls.
9306270	9307671	I get to be Jerry, that's all.
9307752	9309573	Alright, forget it.
9309593	9310493	Hi, Ranma.
9310714	9312014	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
9312915	9315037	Yeah, I just got one thing to say.
9315237	9315877	I'll make it quick.
9316157	9320180	I'm tired of everybody bitching at me that I jump on the Skype lane first for everybody else.
9320420	9325764	If you don't want me on almost every single week, call in and be relevant about something.
9325784	9328546	Don't get mad at me because I have something to contribute to the show.
9328686	9330949	They had a good 10 minutes to call before you got in.
9331029	9331409	Exactly.
9331449	9332190	I was waiting.
9332511	9336355	I was not waiting to be first, but no one was calling, so I stepped up.
9336415	9337296	Calm down.
9337737	9338318	Slow your roll.
9338618	9339859	I'm just tired of the play.
9339899	9340720	No, you can get madder.
9340740	9341261	That's kind of hot.
9341401	9341922	That's good stuff.
9344254	9346515	All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls.
9346875	9347596	All right, later.
9347776	9348297	Take care, buddy.
9349317	9349397	Bye.
9349417	9349878	See you later.
9350038	9355642	Somehow his phone call turned into convincing DarkSakura to sing in front of hundreds of people on the internet at Umlaut.
9355982	9356683	I love this show.
9356723	9357163	I really do.
9357183	9357563	Good times.
9357583	9358764	What are you going to play, Eddie?
9360245	9360585	I don't know.
9360626	9360966	The harp.
9361386	9362927	They don't have a harp.
9363187	9363948	Oh, damn it.
9363988	9365069	Whatever they've got, I'll do it.
9365169	9365509	All right.
9366750	9367190	Sounds good.
9367210	9368791	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9368811	9370753	Your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9372794	9373434	Rob Es Muey Caliente
9405672	9420050	Lucha Libre en Telemundo That's all I know Lunes, Martes, Miércoles I'm from Alabama We just learned how to speak English there Actually, you'll find this really funny This is Actdeft, of course, right?
9421251	9436097	you know what's funny is now I'm seeing because Skype is popping up like all these people who have never called the show before are starting to call in so we're gonna have to make this call quick so we get to some more people but I just want to quickly throw this out here do you know how we used to learn Spanish in high school you'd probably get a kick out of this
9437850	9438771	No, I haven't.
9439011	9443894	Okay, there's this little song and I still remember it to this day and it's how you learn how to conjugate verbs.
9443914	9445135	Okay, you ready?
9445676	9457684	Vamos, hablar, el verbo, caminar, caminar, caminar, to walk, yo, camino, tu, camines, el, camine, y usted también.
9457724	9459145	I still remember this song to this day.
9459205	9459906	Isn't that pathetic?
9460226	9460946	I took French.
9460966	9462848	That's horrible, Rob.
9462888	9464629	We didn't have any songs.
9464689	9466330	What did you think of the verb conjugation song?
9466350	9466950	Wasn't it awesome?
9467992	9469335	Oh, yeah.
9469716	9469996	All right.
9470959	9473565	So speaking of video games, what's up in video game world?
9474868	9476291	Yeah, video games, so interesting.
9476813	9477775	Oh, I wanted to talk about...
9479197	9506021	a story you talked about last week about a certain video game site that sells old games ah yes, that site that went up and down and then up again oh I think they're still down though because we're definitely not covering the story that they came back so in my mind I'm aware that they're still down there went my final story of the night aww, what would you want to say about the site that shall not be named?
9507369	9522376	Well, not necessarily about this site, but about like Steam and other sites like, I don't remember the other, like Direct2Drive also, that sell games via digital distribution.
9526522	9531824	Well, you know, it has a lot of people kind of thinking about digital distribution with the website going down.
9531884	9536946	It's kind of like a lot of people were giving it second thought, like, gee, is one day all my games just going to suddenly stop working?
9537327	9546830	Now, to be fair, I believe the games that the website gogged me with a pitchfork was selling, they were DRM-free, right?
9547591	9550352	And then Steam has always said if they ever go down –
9550672	9551293	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9569229	9576819	Yeah, it's kind of worrying because I have a lot of games I have bought and given to me on Steam.
9576879	9583347	So I kind of worry about that where Steam is going to be down someday.
9583367	9583848	It's possible.
9583848	9604669	I think you'll be okay if you read the terms of service for Steam it sounds like you'll be okay now here's the one you would worry about honestly if I were you it would be that on live as neat as that service is and as cool as it looks with the whole streaming game through the internet or whatever when you buy those games you're basically buying the game on someone else's computer and if that service ever goes down you're going to lose that game now I think they've
9605960	9630346	excuse me they've guaranteed it for what like three years I think but that's you know after that three years you may not have the game anymore which you know after three years you may not want to play the game anymore but I don't know there's some games I want to go back and visit after a long time like the very first Civilization I could still play that game it's great and no I didn't play Civ 5 this week I'm a bad Civ fan anyhow
9632137	9633498	Good thing I'm live.
9634239	9637861	I think it's not available in Mexico, so I don't have to worry about that.
9638181	9639322	Hopefully someday.
9639622	9641644	You guys always get last in line.
9641684	9642264	I'm sorry.
9642925	9643185	Yeah.
9643665	9643965	All right.
9644266	9646387	Well, any other thoughts before we let you go?
9648168	9649229	No, that's pretty much it.
9649529	9649789	All right.
9649829	9654673	You have a good one, and I hope you enjoy the new Kirby game when it comes out because I know you're a big Kirby fan.
9654913	9655153	All right.
9655213	9657155	It's in your icon in case I forgot.
9657495	9657775	Take care.
9660701	9663703	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9663843	9664343	Sorry, Doctor.
9664363	9665384	I kind of took over that call.
9665404	9665884	That's all right.
9665904	9666224	That's all right.
9666404	9666644	Go ahead.
9666724	9667125	That's hot.
9667425	9667725	That's hot.
9667785	9670406	I'm going to be really horny tonight.
9670806	9672147	Okay.
9672207	9675909	Well, this concludes another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9676329	9676549	All right.
9676949	9677410	No, just kidding.
9677470	9679691	We still have time for a few more calls.
9679711	9683773	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9683813	9686014	And to those of you guys, I saw some first-time callers trying to get through.
9686594	9688435	So we'll see if we can't get some of these calls here.
9690243	9694546	Is that a call?
9694586	9696027	Yes, that is a call coming in right now.
9696047	9696447	Let's take it.
9697688	9699309	Thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.
9699329	9700249	You're online with the doctor.
9700289	9700609	What's up?
9702791	9704072	Hey, this is Red Entertainment.
9704712	9705152	Hey, what's up?
9705352	9705873	What's on your mind?
9707133	9709015	I want to bitch about PSN for a second.
9709255	9710015	Okay, right on.
9711456	9717360	Well, I got Move and I downloaded a couple demos because I didn't get the $99 PSN
9719039	9721761	package with the demo disc in it.
9723202	9733570	So I set this up to download overnight and usually I can go to work or set stuff to download overnight on live and it'll be done when I wake up or get home.
9735352	9740256	So I wake up and the thing is my PlayStation 3 is still on.
9742357	9742978	I'm serious.
9743758	9745120	It's still trying to download?
9746240	9748262	Well no, it downloaded overnight but it took
9748729	9754395	at least eight hours because I went to sleep about 2 a.m.
9754495	9757337	and left to go see a movie at about 11 and it was still on.
9758419	9759760	What was it you were trying to download?
9759800	9761021	Just the patch?
9762202	9765005	Seven demos for Move.
9765465	9765826	Wow.
9765886	9767828	And none of them were any bigger than about 350 megs.
9771092	9772833	It wasn't the same day the network went down, right?
9773554	9775055	Maybe they were just getting hammered?
9775115	9775515	I don't know.
9775536	9777217	That's kind of freaky.
9777717	9780620	You know, you can buy full games on PSN, can't you?
9780660	9783983	It's like gigs and gigs of data that would just take you hours.
9784003	9790708	You could just go out the door, drive to the mall downtown and back in less time than it would take for the stupid game to download.
9791849	9795352	Digital distribution might not really be the wave of the future just yet.
9795852	9801457	It works for the smaller games like on Xbox Live Arcade and some of the smaller PSN games but that's crazy.
9801537	9807843	I imagine just a bunch of people were hitting it all at once but it's kind of surprising they don't have a better backup system for that.
9808703	9820193	Well a lot of people must be trying to download the Heavy Rain move patch now because I triggered it to download at about 9 o'clock which is 8 Pacific and
9821038	9821438	And that's it.
9843251	9845273	This is pretty good quality for an iPad, I must say.
9845293	9846373	I don't even know.
9846413	9846674	Who knew?
9847654	9847935	Huh.
9848435	9850196	Well, I don't know, sir.
9850577	9854400	You could call Sony and complain, or you could just bitch about it on internet forums like you're doing now.
9854480	9855601	Yay!
9855621	9858042	Because that's probably what most people are going to be doing.
9858383	9859183	I mean, what can you do?
9859203	9860204	Most of what the internet is for.
9860464	9861265	Yeah, exactly.
9861325	9864127	It's for bitching anonymously on internet forums about your products.
9864487	9865548	Yay!
9866349	9867990	Anything else you want to complain about while you're on?
9869471	9869771	No.
9869992	9870292	I was...
9871791	9874373	I did finally play some of the demos and they're really good.
9874433	9876654	The Tumble demo is really nice.
9877675	9884720	And so is Ruse, which is kind of what I've always wanted from out of the Wii.
9885560	9890964	Do you think that the PlayStation might have a serious competitor here to the Wii?
9894046	9894646	I don't know.
9894686	9895967	It all depends on the games.
9896407	9896988	Right, right.
9898149	9900050	But it sounds like you were enjoying a couple of these demos?
9901718	9924189	yeah the uh ruse demo is kind of this militaristic uh strategy game which I might have to pick that up when it finally comes out I don't know I still haven't got the move myself yet maybe uh maybe at some point or I'll just go over to Loki and play his that sounds like an even better idea right Loki yeah all right I haven't even played mine yet uh any other uh last thoughts before we let you go
9925695	9926295	That's about it.
9926535	9926836	All right.
9926896	9928016	Just don't forget to turn off the porn.
9928036	9930917	Hopefully someday I will be able to play Heavy Rain with Move.
9931318	9931518	All right.
9931538	9932218	Well, let us know.
9932298	9933118	Maybe next week.
9935459	9936660	Maybe it might take that long.
9936780	9937180	All right.
9937260	9937640	Good luck.
9938661	9938981	Take care.
9939061	9939421	You too.
9940682	9941062	All right.
9941082	9946284	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9946704	9947345	Give us a call.
9947385	9947845	Let's walk.
9951733	9954676	I liked his little icon on Skype because it was Daria.
9954816	9955557	It was Daria.
9955617	9956558	You love Daria, right?
9956658	9956998	I do.
9957158	9958439	All right, Doctor, you ready for another call?
9958479	9958720	Sure.
9958900	9959160	All right.
9960401	9961923	You're online with Orange Lounge Radio.
9961943	9962583	This is the Doctor.
9962823	9963164	What's up?
9964044	9965306	Hello, it's Salacious Pop.
9966327	9967548	Hey, what's up, Salacious Pop?
9968128	9968569	Not much.
9968849	9974314	I'm calling in so everyone can hear my hot, sexy, I have a chest cold bro voice.
9975030	9976111	Dude, I love the bro voice.
9976471	9981835	Yeah, I'm going to go put on a Dave Matthews band CD and put on a visor sideways.
9982355	9983376	That's awesome.
9983996	9984496	Great visual.
9984516	9986858	So, yeah, keep talking, keep talking.
9987198	9993162	I was calling about Ranma's comment that Mad Catz really just needs to stop making controllers.
9993322	9993582	Okay.
9993642	9994983	I have a little story about that.
9995263	9997805	Awesome.
9997905	10003629	I bought one of their 8-in-1 memory sticks for the Dreamcast where it has a switch on it.
10004494	10005735	It died after like a month.
10005795	10006836	It deleted all my saves.
10007597	10009638	No, I love that it not only died, but it deleted them.
10009718	10010599	That's amazing.
10011160	10022369	Yeah, and then since he was talking about controllers, I bought a Blanca 6 button, the fighting pad for the 360 when Street Fighter 4 came out.
10023430	10026252	And I got it off, I think eBay was brand new.
10026332	10029595	It was in like the horrible clamshell where you need like a box cutter and a...
10030069	10032230	I spent like 40 bucks on a Mad Catz controller that was just dead.
10032250	10033331	Like, that's awesome.
10033351	10033891	So they need to stop.
10052803	10053123	Very good.
10053143	10054984	Yeah, I agree with all those stories.
10055105	10058266	I would probably buy one just to step on it and kick it across the room.
10060107	10061088	I can hear Rob giggling.
10061688	10062289	Hi.
10062889	10063249	Hi.
10063529	10063990	Feel better?
10064650	10064910	Fine.
10065330	10066311	Also, since
10066741	10068923	You guys are talking about the Tomb Raider reboot.
10069083	10076848	I really think that no one care about Lara Croft anymore and that they need to put that franchise to bed because there are so many bad games associated with that.
10077009	10077689	Hold on.
10077789	10082733	You enjoyed that Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light game as much as I did unless you were lying for my benefit.
10083393	10084354	No, see, that's the thing.
10084414	10085655	That's an awesome game.
10086355	10086916	No, it is.
10087096	10091259	But because it has Lara Croft and Tomb Raider attached to it, like that's the brand.
10091912	10095074	People are going to go, oh, ew, what's this shit, and they're not going to buy it.
10096995	10102659	If that co-op game was put under a new IP with new characters, people would go, oh, this is a great game, because it is.
10103380	10115588	But just, the Tomb Raider games for the PS2 were awful, 3, 4, and 5 for the PS1 were awful, so I just feel that this kind of box office poison, like, I don't know, she's, Lara Croft is...
10116297	10118798	Lara Croft is the M. Night Shyamalan of video games?
10118838	10119438	Pretty much.
10120038	10120839	They don't care.
10121379	10128421	She was genre-breaking in 96 with her platforming and her bad pyramid tits, but now no one cares.
10130222	10130922	No one care.
10131562	10137424	No one care about Lara Croft, which is a shame because I think that Eidos can still put out good games with her.
10137604	10141166	It's just that she, as an icon, is bringing their ideas down.
10141366	10141726	I don't know.
10142302	10144863	Do you think maybe they got one more chance?
10145463	10149704	Maybe this reboot, if it's really good, maybe people can look past it and forgive?
10150124	10152405	Or no, it's over, put it past her?
10152505	10160107	I thought the adventure game that they put out for her last year, or the year before, I think it was for the PS3, was also supposed to be really good.
10160387	10163388	But again, I've never really heard of that.
10163508	10167389	Once it came out, no one cared, and it never really broke any sales charts.
10168393	10169934	So I think it may just be a done deal.
10170114	10175777	I guess with the reboot, if they'd have to put a lot of money into marketing it, just saying, like, no, really, guys, this one's actually good.
10176118	10180881	Or just put the topless patch in, honestly, and then boys everywhere will want to play, right?
10181361	10183542	Just release it on PC in the skidding community.
10183842	10184823	We'll take care of that for them.
10185303	10185784	There you go.
10186844	10188405	All right, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
10190376	10191017	Nope, that's it.
10191217	10195400	I managed to stave off having a coughing fit for a good two minutes, so I think now's a good time to leave.
10195741	10197362	Okay, feel better.
10197442	10199944	Get better before Disneyland so I can spin you around in a teacup.
10200405	10201406	Yay, I'll throw up on you.
10201466	10201806	Awesome.
10201946	10202687	Alright, bye.
10203067	10206290	Okay, bye.
10206310	10209453	1-877-GAME-OLR He's funny, huh?
10209653	10209953	He's funny.
10210093	10211014	He's a good guy.
10211194	10214197	Yes, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.
10215757	10216037	Oh, good lord.
10236297	10238558	Yeah, how do you smell that all the way from where you're at?
10238578	10240880	That's kind of, that's a little bit freaky, I don't know.
10241780	10243301	Yeah, so.
10243962	10246343	Did you have any other last minute stories, Loki, that you wanted to get to?
10250085	10250665	Sure.
10250726	10251506	Hold on, we're getting more calls.
10251546	10252687	Now it's lighting up like crazy.
10252827	10253507	Let's get to another call.
10253567	10254087	Doctor, you ready?
10254328	10254488	Yep.
10255728	10257229	Thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.
10257269	10258190	You're online with the Doctor.
10258370	10258750	What's up?
10259491	10260291	Hey, what's up?
10261132	10261432	Not much.
10261472	10262012	How are you doing?
10262052	10263173	I'm online with the Doctor, I suppose.
10263584	10263964	What's that?
10264625	10265546	I'm on with the doctor.
10265706	10266486	You're on with the doctor.
10266526	10267047	I'm the doctor.
10268288	10270009	Is there any aliens I need to be worrying about then?
10270950	10271910	There's tons of aliens, dude.
10271930	10273572	I got my sonic screwdriver and I'm ready to go.
10274321	10275922	Oh shit, I gotta run.
10277022	10280764	Oh shit, we better, because there is an awful lot of running, so we definitely need to do that.
10281484	10283866	Who are you talking to?
10284786	10287287	So besides the aliens, what's going on tonight with you?
10287487	10288148	Wait, who is this?
10288208	10288888	Hi, who is this?
10289548	10290229	This is Zappy.
10290349	10290989	Hi, Zappy.
10291509	10291889	How are you?
10292530	10293030	I'm pretty good.
10293290	10294371	Okay, let's talk to the doctor again.
10294511	10294711	Okay.
10296091	10301012	Well, the reason I was talking to Colin was because it's sort of related to what Red Entertainment was talking about before.
10301612	10305193	It's because I have a copy of Ruse for the Xbox 360.
10306873	10310354	And let me tell you, that controller isn't cutting it.
10312154	10319455	Like, I can see it's a really good game, but you're just being held back by the horrible, horrible, horrible controls.
10321315	10324536	Like, I try and select my units and I'm always picking the wrong ones.
10325129	10343282	and it's just not working I could see that because that's a lot of games in game room are kind of like that a Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 kind of made me think that because it was just so awful to try and control but it's kind of a bummer that that controller really ruins some games
10344434	10345155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10369363	10371484	It was like a big gimmick to charge me $65.
10372685	10377428	Isn't that terrible that they're only bundling it with that dumb play and charge or whatever it is?
10377509	10380070	Like, oh, it's so annoying how they do this.
10380150	10388756	It's just like Nintendo doing that new Nintendo remote with Wii Plus or whatever with a crappy tennis knockoff game.
10388816	10389357	I mean, really?
10390437	10394160	Yeah, at least the Wii Sports Resort was at least, you know, fun.
10396223	10398024	Super Metroid is like the holy grail of video games to me.
10425857	10428000	Oh yeah, I love Super Metroid.
10428100	10431724	And if they botched it, I'm really, really sad.
10432905	10437811	My experience with New Metroid was about five minutes at Best Buy, and it seemed okay.
10438532	10441535	But five minutes, I can't really say here or there.
10442537	10445460	Could be good, just kind of made me honest.
10445874	10452095	Yeah, you can't base an entire review of a game off of just five minutes, you know, because I'm sure everybody at E3 loved it.
10452395	10455516	You know, the lines to play that game at E3 were like hours long.
10456296	10459917	It was almost as long as the 3DS line at some points because it was moving a little slower.
10460457	10460937	Really?
10461217	10465278	I guess the people who couldn't get into the 3DS line said, okay, I'll sell for Metroid.
10465338	10465578	Yes.
10466578	10468459	Maybe not hours, but like at least an hour.
10469079	10470579	It's crazy how long lines get there.
10471144	10475626	That reminds me, I'm getting my wallet raided this week to find out how much they'll be raping me out of my wallet.
10476306	10476606	For?
10477446	10477967	The 3DS.
10478387	10479007	Oh.
10479187	10480348	Are they announcing a date this week?
10481048	10484929	Well, from what I'm hearing, they're probably going to announce it in the middle of this week.
10484969	10485810	I think it was Wednesday?
10486010	10489171	That's right, because Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, right?
10489191	10493273	But they always do their own little kind of like spin-off, right?
10493313	10496114	They do their own little fan event around the same time.
10496134	10496734	Does that make sense?
10497679	10524617	so I'm kind of like basically unless they're like charging a thousand bucks they basically got me locked down for that thing I'm gonna say it's probably gonna be $2.49 and it's gonna come with like either I think it'll be like kind of like a tech demo-y type of game that's just a bunch of like the movie trailers and some of the tech demos they were showing it on 3DS and then like Ocarina of Time in 3D or some old ass Nintendo IP that they can just easily do as the pack-in game
10525322	10531948	Well, they got me at launch for DS, and I bought the PSP within three months of launch, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to pick this up.
10532008	10533529	Do you regret buying either of those systems?
10535551	10537433	Maybe the PSP a little bit.
10538934	10545360	The DS I've been having as a paperweight for the last six months, there really hasn't been anything coming out this year for it.
10546132	10550014	No, yeah, they didn't really show a lot at E3 either because it's all about the 3DS now.
10550535	10552916	Except for the little girl games like Fancy Nancy.
10553737	10556918	The only thing that seems interesting coming out is maybe Pokemon in black and white.
10557199	10557779	Well, that's true.
10557999	10559340	That's going to be a big deal when it comes out.
10560160	10561461	But otherwise, I just don't see much.
10561481	10562862	Maybe it's Final Fantasy?
10562942	10564043	I don't like Pokemon.
10565844	10566124	Alright.
10566564	10569406	Well, Zappy, any other thoughts for the listeners before we let you go tonight?
10571110	10571951	Don't buy rules on the 360.
10571991	10576959	The PC is probably the best choice and maybe the PlayStation Move version.
10577854	10578254	All right.
10578755	10581036	Word of warning of caution to the listeners.
10581677	10581857	All right.
10581877	10582637	You have a good one, Zappy.
10582677	10583178	Thanks for the call.
10583738	10583958	Later.
10584178	10584398	Later.
10584679	10584959	Later.
10585359	10585659	All right.
10585679	10587060	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10587080	10589082	Thank you guys so much for all the calls tonight.
10589682	10590943	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
10591103	10594985	Like, you should have called when we first opened it because it was wide open.
10595025	10597167	I'm so sorry, guys, but we got to wrap up and get out of here tonight.
10597187	10598788	My friend Frodo got through at the very beginning.
10599809	10600269	Clearly.
10600529	10608974	Yeah, by the way, for those that are angry they didn't get through on tonight, you can thank that first call for eating up 30 seconds of your time, just so you know.
10609394	10609875	There you go.
10611495	10611856	I know.
10613136	10615398	Quickly, any other last minute stories Loki wants to get out?
10615678	10618259	Any plants versus zombies action DarkSakura wants to share?
10619400	10621181	I'm currently owning a bunch of zombies.
10621241	10624183	You know what that game needs, and maybe it has it, and I don't know, multiplayer.
10625164	10626764	The Xbox 360 version, it does.
10627305	10627745	Does it?
10628265	10629206	They've added it, yeah.
10630020	10630561	That's cool.
10630601	10631402	I might have to play it on the 360.
10632384	10633765	I'm just playing a little puzzle mode.
10634386	10638152	I don't know if this was mentioned before because I haven't been paying a lot of attention.
10638913	10643399	Plants vs. Zombies is now becoming a quest in World of Warcraft Cataclysm.
10644401	10645162	So that's pretty awesome.
10645390	10647912	Peacebloom vs. Ghouls or whatever they're calling it.
10647972	10648832	It's hilarious.
10649513	10651074	I want the sunflower pet, not gonna lie.
10652635	10657318	Also, there is a fan release of the Command & Conquer 3, The Forgotten.
10657498	10663702	It's a brand new expansion for Command & Conquer 3 and the best part about it, it's fan made.
10663862	10674069	So, go check it out at theforgotten.cnclabs.com and check out the new units and different things you get to play around with.
10674509	10675110	So, that's kind of cool.
10675790	10676631	You said unit.
10677411	10689257	Also, World of Warcraft, I guess, mobile guild chat is coming to World of Warcraft, I believe via the World of Warcraft Armory, which is an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Android device app.
10690198	10693259	But you probably have to pay the premium that you have to pay.
10693279	10695400	It is a $2.99 monthly subscription fee.
10696821	10701083	Not gonna lie, though, it's extremely homosexual.
10701443	10702164	It is homosexual.
10702184	10702484	Yeah.
10703044	10705865	Well, to be honest, I'm not going to lie, it actually sounds kind of cool.
10705965	10707106	You would use that.
10707346	10711427	Being able to sign on and just say, hey, I'm on the toilet.
10711467	10712148	Hey, I just spent $3.
10712188	10720911	Couldn't you, I don't know, just sign up for some other sort of, I'm sure there's other voice chat options, perhaps through Skype.
10720991	10722411	I'm not really going to get it.
10722912	10728014	I mean, through Skype, which is free, and I'm sure you can do some sort of party chat with that.
10728074	10729834	Ventrilo on the iPhone, that's what I need.
10729934	10731475	Do they have that, chatters?
10732095	10735417	That would be crazy if they did.
10735477	10738178	Amiga77 says, you mean it's homotextual.
10739759	10740419	That was funny.
10740479	10741239	I like that.
10743060	10743581	So cute.
10744641	10746522	The baby, not homotextual.
10746622	10746862	I know.
10748023	10748283	All right.
10748323	10750544	Anything else you want to share, Loki, the last of the stories?
10751404	10751464	No.
10751484	10752285	All right.
10752625	10754746	DarkSakura, anything you've got over there?
10755979	10756839	Yeah, that's what I thought.
10756939	10757900	More plants versus zombies.
10758200	10760481	Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10760521	10762982	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to our show tonight.

10773326	10776148	But continue to support independent podcasts and independent radio.
10776168	10782110	There's a whole lot of great shows at allgames.com or seriously, just go into iTunes and look for some independent shows.
10782610	10783711	There's a lot of really great stuff.

10785252	10785412	What?
10785532	10791994	I would also like to make a mention of Comic Insanity, the other podcast that I record.
10792314	10793194	Cheap plug, cheap plug.
10793214	10793755	No, it's all good.
10794035	10798276	With Tiara and Shadow.
10799157	10800197	And we're really awesome.
10800217	10803938	And you can find us at infamous, it's infamous without the I, .net.
10806883	10809324	And the Robin Extra for Warcraft show is still in development.
10810184	10811444	It's going to happen soon.
10811504	10817266	But it's just we're having problems being able to tape it like at the same, you know, just our schedules kind of conflict.
10817306	10819926	And then we haven't been able to get the Skype thing to work.
10819966	10821107	So we have to tape it in person.
10821267	10823407	And now I don't have all the recording stuff at my house.
10823707	10825208	And you're too busy playing WoW.
10825468	10827028	No, I can tear myself away from WoW for that.
10827388	10827748	And I do.
10828169	10829949	But that's that.
10832557	10834479	I'm being whispered secret messages from DarkSakura.
10834500	10835901	She's whispering sweet nothings in my ear.
10836121	10836422	Oh my.
10836662	10837043	Good times.
10838089	10838590	So there we go.
10838770	10839631	That's going to do it for another show.
10839651	10841312	Let's go around and give everybody's final thought.

10903573	10905215	I want a taco.
10906055	10907297	Me too.
10907417	10909639	I'm back on raw food and I want a taco.
10909659	10911620	What the hell is that noise?
10911780	10914303	Stop downloading the Vuvuzela apps right now.
10914823	10916745	That doesn't sound like a Vuvuzela.
10916765	10918927	It sounds like a cat being strangled.
10919447	10921869	One more time.
10922150	10923511	A Vuvuzela sounds like this.
10925680	10925840	Haha.
10926581	10928763	Haha, that's what you get.
10928904	10930585	Dying of fire.
10931727	10932748	Until next week.
