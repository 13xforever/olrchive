Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that show dedicated to video games
Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle
All of it, we're the place where every gamer has a voice
And leading the charge over the next few hours are myself
Rob Roberts and with me as always
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
Om nom nom
How are you?
Orange Lounge Foodio going on over there
I slept most of the day
Awesome, Orange Lounge Nappio
I took an awesome nap yesterday actually
And that's how I was able to stay up late
Because I went clubbing and I was able to stay up until like 2am
It was fun
It sounds like you had a good time
I had a great time
I'm just very proud of myself because I used the cucumber that I grew myself
And I made myself some salad and it's fantastic
Soon you're going to be moving into a commune
And starting your own
Okay
I have five plants that I'm growing in the backyard
And three of them are like stuff to season with
Remember the fort?
The fort?
The fort
It was, oh this was years ago in OLR history
This was probably around like
When DDR Angel first started coming to the show
Probably around like episode like 30-ish right
And she had a friend
And I can't remember the dude's name
I'm a horrible, well I remember his real name
I don't want to say it on the show
It was D-U
Yeah
Yeah okay
I think I remember because
Right?
But he lived out in the middle of nowhere right
And to get to his house
He had to go by this place in the middle of nowhere
With all these signs that were like keep out
And trespassers will be shot on sight
And it just looked like some dude
Has had himself holed up in there since the 60s
And we decided to call that the OLR fort
Oh yeah
And that's who we're all going to move into remember
I remember
The fort
Oh
I can't remember all this stuff
Oh good times
Your brain works better than mine does today
That's alright
Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki
Hello
How are you?
Hi
Happy birthday Loki
Thank you
Is your mic on?
I don't know if we're even hearing you
It is on
It is on but for some reason we are not hearing you at all
I screwed with the volume
I don't think we screwed with it at all
Are you guys hearing Loki?
I have the crappy mic
I don't know what's going on here
Live radio and I'm not sure
I guess we are hearing Loki
He's just not as loud as the others
No I'm not even sure
No you're not on at all
That's oh you know what
Good ol'
Ah they plugged me in the wrong hole
There you go
Hi Loki
See this is what happens when you put it in the wrong hole okay
Let's try that again
And the one and only tech master Loki
Hello
Hi how are you doing?
I'm tired
I plugged it in the out hole
Oops
That's what happens
Well happy birthday a little late
Thank you
That's right
Never forget September 11th Loki's birthday
No I'm being a little bit silly
You don't have any tragedies on your birthday do you?
Ah no but I do have a victory
My birthday
There's two reasons my birthday rocks
One it's the day that Strom Thurmond died
And B it's the day that sodomy laws were overturned in Texas
That's what I get on my birthday
See my birthday was the Waco thing
Oh was it?
Yeah
Oh no no tragedies on my birthday yet
Just victories
Bitch
So talking about something funny made out of tragedy I guess
There's this pet and feed store that's near my house or whatever
And they have this horse statue that's out in front of
Like a full size horse statue that's out in front of their building
And they dress it up you know to
For like Halloween or you know St. Paddy's Day
All the different stuff they dress it up themed like that
So they decided hey we're gonna dress it up for 9-11
And so this horse has a replica of the twin towers on its back
And it's like
That almost sounds tacky
It is extremely tacky
I get wanting to be patriotic
And I do think they kind of should make a day out of 9-11 as a remembrance
And a day to kind of celebrate all things American
Although I realize it's also like the 4th of July as it is
But you know what I mean
Like it's too bad that that had to happen on your birthday
But it's just you know some people are born on Christmas
Some people are born on you know the day sodomy laws are repealed
Some people are born on 9-11
And you know it's just a birthday
Yeah what can you do
At least if you're born on Easter you don't always have to have it again on Easter
True or if you're born February 29th you get to stay young for a very long time
Even though you look really old for your age
Yes
Alright anyhow
Let's start I guess with a little bit of How's Your Gaming Week
Oh I should say about the marathon
I want to thank the listeners first off
The marathon was awesome
And if you haven't heard it all it's all up on the feed now
We went for 10 and a half hours live
But when you take out the music it was about 9 hours 30-40 minutes worth of podcast
In good times
And we didn't end up playing any games live on air like we thought we were going to
So just really good times
We did match games
No no no I meant video games
Oh
On air not the OLR games
But yeah I mean and big thanks to Alan and Bradley too
Dan sure did
Without their help
Dan
He played the game that shall not be named
For a very long time
Yet
Yes he was playing the Reach Around game for some time
He and his friend
That's what they finished
Yes he and Alex were playing Reach Around
For a while
Has he finished the game yet
I have no idea Dan left for Washington State to go spend like 8 days with his family and
Leave me here by my you
Oh whatever you're going to run around the house naked and play Star Trek online
That's what I do anyway
Well not during the show thankfully
I was playing it when you came in the house
With her clothes on thankfully
Yes
I'm wearing my stylish X-Men t-shirt
But it's why she probably had the door locked
So when I banged on the door she was like oh shit where's my bra
Alright anyway
Oh bored fat fat fat
Alright uh ew
How was your gaming week Dark Soccer besides naked Star Trek
I wasn't naked
I was playing Star Trek online when Rob came in
And I actually stopped in the middle of the part that I was on
Because when I start the game I'll just start right back from where I am
Which is a very good thing about Star Trek online
Unless you're like right at the beginning of it
And you're almost done with the first part and then you die
Anyway um
I played Peggle
You know I haven't touched Epic Citadel since I downloaded it
Except to upgrade it
And I really haven't done much else in the way of gaming
Well Dan got uh
Not
Dead Rising 2
I always want to say Left 4 Dead but
It's Dead Rising 2 the Mission Zero
K-Zero
And he's gotten all of the endings except
Man the bad ending where the little girl turns into a zombie
OMG spoilers
Don't care
If you haven't downloaded it yet and if you haven't got there by now
Then I don't want to hear it
Plus it's kind of obvious
It doesn't even show her turning into a zombie
Well I mean she's a child
I don't care I wanted to see a zombie five year old
I'm sorry you were disappointed
I mean it's like when you watch zombie movies
Okay okay
When you watch zombie movies right
Shouldn't there be like zombie dogs and children
And zombie old people
And
You know and like zombies in wheelchairs
Well actually there wasn't Shaun of the Dead
I suppose it depends on how graphic you want to get
Like and all the people in hospitals turning into zombies and stuff
It's
It just doesn't make sense to me
But yeah
I also have that problem with zombie video games
It was pretty cool though
Especially my favorite weapon that you can make in that game
Is you can get a pitchfork
And attach it to a rifle
And then you can stab them with a pitchfork
Pull them up in the air and shoot them with a shotgun
And they'll explode
That's awesome
And you can also go to this place and get a broadsword
And slice zombies down the middle
And like you can make like the nail bat and everything
But man the pitchfork bayonet
That's innovation
I haven't figured out any weapon combinations
Outside of the nails and bat
Only because I was specifically shown that at E3
How to do that
Pitchfork, rifle
Well you try to figure stuff out
And then also you get cards
And you can take all that stuff into the main game later on
And it even has a dude throwing up
Hooray
Yes
And then you can tape him to a cat
And he becomes a weapon right
But I do love that idea
It certainly seems one step past
The Fable 2 pub games
Which was a neat little innovation in itself
But this is kind of like taking it to the next level
Where like now a games demo
Is actually a whole different game
And yeah you pay for it
But it's kind of a standalone experience
And you know you get to take what you've earned into the main game
It's kind of neat
And it's got three different endings
It's reverse DLC
It's not download content to expand the game
It's very strange
But I like it
It was really cool
When Dan did one of the bad endings
He had the dude with the mohawk wearing a waitress dress
And I was like
Okay that's pretty funny
Because you see this burly guy walking in
Wearing this dress
And then falling to his knees
I can't wait to see some of the hideous costumes you can put the main character in
Because I'll tell you what
Some of the best parts of the first one
Were some of the really skanky costumes
And the random and children's clothing
And the Mega Man outfit
This one's set in Las Vegas isn't it?
Yes
So we need to have the whole showgirls
You know big fantail
And we have to go find Tiara Zombie
Because she lives in Vegas
And undoubtedly be a zombie in the game
We won't aim for the head on the Tiara Zombie
I'll refrain from using the pitchfork bayonetta
On Tiara
What I'll do I'll put a cardboard box on her head
And just watch her run around
In the garden playing PS2 games
Like in Shaun of the Dead
I can't wait to see what kind of comment we get from her
Because she's on AOL during the show right?
Yeah I don't know I have to ask her if she's listening
Let's see going to our chatroom
At chat.orangelaunchradio.com
Let's see a hitstun suggests a cat gun
To which actdeft is saying laser cat gun
That would be a great weapon
I could see using a laser cat
That would be amazing
Loki how was your gaming week?
Pretty eventful actually
Because we did our game summit thing
At our work where we invite publishers
And some of our customers out
And we did it this year kind of
Expo style I guess
Each publisher had a different booth
For the ones that showed up
Not that many bright games though
Even though I offered them like
Hey if you need to borrow a 360 or something
I can help you out with that
So I only played really
Like a few different things
The first one
And there is a video out there
Of it somewhere I don't want to know
Where though
The first game I played this week was
Just Dance 2
And only because
The Ubisoft rep wanted
To demonstrate it and no one would play it
So I was like okay fine
I'll do this and be a good sport about it
So I did that
And she kicked my ass in every single song
Even though she says she didn't play it before
I don't believe her
It was actually kind of fun
It's kind of neat because the game itself
If you haven't played it yet
It's going to be very similar to what Dance Central
I guess is going to be
It pretty much just plays like that
And all you do is you hold the remote
And you just kind of mimic what's on the screen
And it will just kind of
It'll only detect what you're doing with the remote
But it's still pretty close
And it's fun
And it's got some decent songs in there
Did you jam to TikTok?
Did you get your Kesha on?
Yes we did actually
Why?
Why is this not on YouTube?
Why is there not video of Loki playing Just Dance 2?
I am so upset
We mean why is this on YouTube?
It is on YouTube
Oh my god where?
I don't know
There is video of you on YouTube playing Just Dance 2
I don't see it
Tiger Claw
He's the best web scavenger I know
Tiger Claw needs to find this somehow
Use your Google Fu Ninja abilities
I don't know if my boss has uploaded it yet
Because they were taking video
Oh man as soon as this is up you've got to tell me
Yeah I do I guess
Anyways
Try not to sound too excited
Yeah
I'm going to see if I can find
I'm sorry you can find it later
I don't want to cause too much dead air while you search
Yeah no problem
Anyways
So other than Just Dance 2 I got to play around with some of the move demo stuff
I played actually the full version of Sports Champions
Which is kind of fun
I kind of like the archery that's in the game
And that was pretty cool
It sucks though because at the time though
They had this kit that they had
Or it was actually one of the retail
Not 4
250GB systems that they're going to be selling
With Sports Champions bundled in there and stuff
So they have
You can play a lot of these games
Like the archery stuff
Either with two of the move controllers
Or one controller
So the one controller has it
You take the move and you kind of
Put it over your shoulder like you're pulling an arrow out of a quiver
And then you kind of point it at the screen
That way
And it actually worked really well
And then I also played some of the frisbee golf
Which was kind of fun
But I'm horrible at frisbee golf
I tried a little bit of the table tennis
I don't care for the table tennis too much
But
How did archery in the PlayStation Move sports game
Compare to archery in Wii sport resort
Or whatever
I haven't played Wii sports resort yet
But I think it would be way more accurate
Than it is
It's just
I don't know, it just felt right
I guess
I haven't played it with two of the
Two of the controllers yet
I do have my own kit now
I have two of the move controllers
Which Rob was
Sticking on his chest earlier
And I'm sure there's pictures online
I would not say that those pictures exist on Twitter
He wouldn't say that
No
So I got to play that
Well it makes sense to me
Sony decided to release
Some of the move required games
On the 7th
Of September
And while that may be the case
You're not going to find them in stores
Because
Like most smart stores
They're not going to overnight some product
To their stores
So that it can't be played for a week
Thus frustrating people
So actually
I got to play this by today
And no one had any of the stuff that's already out
For the move
Which is disappointing because I have just the demos to play right now
Which is fine, they're still fun
Another demo I checked out was
Ipet
And I got to say Ipet is retarded
And it really does not work
It seems like a neat idea at first
But you mean
To actually get it so that it looks right
You have to get the camera at
The perfect angle
For a crappy
Itoy game
Way back in the Playstation 2
And stuff
It's not good at all
It doesn't lend well to the argument that
This is just the itoy all over again
It does not
Thankfully that's the only game that's the case
With
They have you
Do a few different things
For example they have you
Play with
Him I guess you move your fingers
And he's supposed to roll over
And stuff
And it just did not detect that
It was just having trouble figuring out what I was trying to do
And then it had me
Draw an airplane
And he'd fly around in it
And I don't know what the
Problem was with this but for some reason
I'm pretty good at tracing
Outlines and stuff
Like on the Wii and the DS
And that kind of thing
When you see outline for the plane
Using the Playstation move controller
It looked like crap
It just was not working too well
But you know hey whatever
It's a crappy game to begin with
And then also they have you trying to wash him
And the problem is I couldn't tell
Like I had trouble figuring out
You know whether my move controller
Was in front or behind him
And stuff like that so I had to kind of try to figure out
Where to turn it in perspective
It's just very awkward
But I mean most people will figure out
That it's a waste of time anyways
Then what else did I try
I tried the Tiger Woods demo
And that worked alright
It's just very difficult to get it set up
So that
It you know
So you can use the move controller
At least I found that it was kind of difficult to get it set up
Oh and calibrating it's actually pretty easy
As far as
Because I was reading some reviews
You know for different things
They had to constantly calibrate the controller
I didn't find that to be the case actually
With sports champions you calibrate it once
And you're good to go
So that was kind of cool
And I'm trying to think of what else I played
That was kind of fun
I tried the
It's like that
Some kung fu game
Where you actually
Roll down the street on like office chairs
And that was crap
It did not control well
Sports champions is fun
Wasn't there a mini game in
Incredible Crisis where you go down the street
In a chair no it's on a
Gurney
Yes it's on the hospital bed yeah
Looking at our chat room chat
BlackWolf is in our chat
The good pal of ours that does the show before us
Live at All Games Radio
When we tape live on Sunday nights
He says oh cool I didn't realize that move was coming out on Friday
And not Sunday originally it was coming out on Sunday
Yeah they kept moving it around
In fact the Sony reps had trouble remembering
What day it was supposed to be coming out on
But yeah it's Friday now not Sunday
Although there are some games coming out on Sunday
But you don't really need to mess with those
It's just the Brunswick bowling game
So would you be paying money for this?
Would I be paying money for it?
If you didn't already have it in your hot little hands
Would you pay money for it?
I might but the problem is I don't know how much
I'm going to play with this
But it's pretty fun
It's definitely
If you like the Wii stuff you're going to probably like this
But it is a lot more sensitive
I think so they kind of took
What they did on the Wii and improved
Upon it which is good so
As long as they come out with
Good games for it then I don't think it's
A bad investment at all
And the best part about it
This is like a lot of the stuff
You probably don't need to get the navigation controller
For because most of the games don't use it
Oh wow
Really you're only going to use the navigation controller
You're going to be playing like SoCom or Killzone 3
I think
I got to admit I'm not sure it's the greatest idea
That they do this whole
Separate skews
For like a camera
A camera and
One controller, a controller
And the navigation
It kind of seems like it's too complicated to figure out
What you need and with all these different
Peripherals out there
It's tough for the designer
I like that they did that though because I own a camera
Now that I've got the kit
I've got two cameras for no reason
But the whole optional navigation controller
Which I guess is true on the Wii to an extent
But every Wii comes with one at least
So the designers know they can do at least one
Well technically it still comes with one
Because it comes with a regular DualShock controller
Which can double as the navigation controller
If you want it to
So if you really
It's kind of awkward to hold it
Because you have to hold it with one hand
But I mean
If you really care then you can use that
As a navigation controller
If for example
Like you're playing Killzone 3
Or something like that and you want to try out the move
Controls and you have a move controller
But you don't have the navigation controller
You can get by with that
But you may want to get an actual navigation controller
Later on
Looking at our chat room live on this Sunday night
At chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Tigerclaw is saying, speaking of move
Sony launched an anti-connect site about the buttons
YayButtons.com
I'd heard about this but I didn't
It wasn't on our list for tonight
Have you looked at this site at all?
Yeah I mean that's great that they have a campaign
About yay buttons and stuff like that
I do love that website name
I gotta say
Yay Buttons is a good name for a site
That's a stupid argument to make right now
Because
Even Microsoft came out and said
Well we never said that we can't have a game
That uses both the connect camera
And the controller
So you know
Hooray with your campaign and everything
And really all these games
That they have out there right now
Just use either the trigger
Or the top move button
Or basically the A and B button
On a Wii remote
Because a lot of these games play just like Wii games
I mean it's
What a shock
I know, what a shock that they play like Wii games
I don't know
It's kind of fun
I mean if you
If you're looking for something that's gonna be
Way better than the Wii
You're probably not gonna find it with this
Alright so what games
Do we have to look forward to on the move
That you're gonna be checking out for us?
Well the
You know
Sports Champions
That's pretty good
I actually haven't played it yet
But there's that
Time Crisis Raising Storm
That looked kind of fun
I like the Toy Story 3 game but
If it's too much money I wouldn't bother
It was cute though
It reminded me of Midway Mania
I might check out
I'm trying to think what else
I would probably pick up for that
I don't know
It's hard to say right now
I'm not gonna pick up
SOCOM
Maybe some of the PlayStation Network games
I'll just see whatever they throw my way
Cause I don't want to spend a lot of money
Alright
Well let's talk about My Gaming Week
Actually before we get to My Gaming Week though
I want to make a special phone call here a little bit
I'm gonna actually call
He was here last week on the show
He's Alan AKA Salacious Pop
AKA my boyfriend
Is sitting there at his computer
And he knows we're calling him cause I want to talk about something here tonight
Hey Alan are you there?
Yep
So Alan
You live in the Bay Area
In California right?
Yes
And you don't live that far away from where there was actually
A really bad tragedy this week right?
Yep
Tell us a little bit about what happened
Thursday evening at about 615
A giant gas main
Several feet across
Blew up underneath some houses
And kind of destroyed an entire neighborhood
Very sad
And a lot of trouble
When they sort through all that mess
But very very sad tragedy
So I mean was it scary?
Did you have to evacuate?
Did you have to get out of the house?
What happened?
Well it happened
The neighborhood affected is maybe two miles away from me
Which is very close
But when it comes to horrible things happening
Is actually a safe amount of distance
I actually did not know
What was going on
Until about 30 minutes later
When my roommate knocked on the door and said
Hey do you know what's going on outside the window right now?
But I may as well have been in another city
This block that I'm on was totally unaffected
All of the wind blew all the smoke
And everything south
Well I'm happy to hear you're okay
And that you're out of it fine
But I remember last year it was around Christmas
Or whatever
A very similar thing happened where I was living at the time
In a suburb called Rancho Cordova
And a house literally blew up
Because of a gas leak
And I remember distinctly
Even though I was about a mile away
I heard this giant boom noise
And things actually shook for a minute
And my car had ash on it
It was crazy
It was really sad
But you didn't hear a giant boom
You didn't feel the shake
Or was it just oh another earthquake
I don't get it. What happened?
So only being two miles away
And it being as large as it was
It did actually shake the building that I'm in
Apparently it rattled windows for miles
In every direction
I was completely oblivious though
Because at the time I was raiding
In WOW
Which is really the punchline
That you were trying desperately to get me to
So yes, I was raiding in WOW
While 53 homes were completely razzed
And my housemate had to tell me
To look out the window
To see what was going on
And he had to tell me to look out the window
To see all the black smoke
Yes, there's the punchline I was looking for
And why I brought you on to tell this horrible
Tragedy story on the video game radio show
Is that you missed
Total chaos and tragedy
Going on mere miles away
Because you were trying to get Fester got down
Yeah
Everyone's judging me right now
Did you get any loot?
No
I got no good drops
But what must have been your reaction though
When you opened up the window
And just saw all the smoke
Were you just like, oh damn
Well yeah, I was like
That's not good
And then I went to KCBS
And SF Gate and I started looking at the feeds
Because there was a huge boom
That set off the gas explosion
And people didn't know what it was
So they thought that maybe a plane had crashed
Into a house and that set off
The gas main, which wasn't the case
So I was reading all the speculation on
If an airplane went down
Which there wasn't, just something sparked
And set off the crack in the pipe
But yeah, so once
I realized what was going on
I took time to check it out
And after the sunset I could see the orange
Glow over the hill
Because the fire burned for
A couple hours because they couldn't turn
The gas main off, so it was like a big blowtorch
Oh my gosh, so sad
Yeah, I can't even imagine
Just being at home, watching Oprah
Or being like Dark Sakura, sitting around naked
Playing Star Trek online
And then suddenly, kaboom
Oops
PG and E didn't notice the crack in the pipe
Uh oh, you know what's actually kind of sad
Though, you know, and again
I seriously don't mean to make light of a tragedy
It's just kind of interesting that
Sometimes we get so
In the zone of gaming that we miss these things
But it's kind of funny, I have a similar story
It's not really gaming related, but it was a couple years ago
Um, 07 maybe
I had just moved into the house
I was at, where we had the OLR studio before
I don't know if I ever brought this up on the show
But the house across the street
From us burned down, like it caught fire
And burned down one night
And I totally missed it going on
I was at home, and totally didn't even
See it happening, you know why?
I was asleep, I was taking a nap
After work, and my roommate comes home
And is like, Rob, Rob, are you here?
Rob, Rob, where's Rob?
Practically barking, and I'm like, what's going on?
He's like, do you not hear the fire trucks
Outside right now?
Do you not see the news media?
And I kind of do that thing where like
I'm kind of groggy and I'm peeking out the window
And it's just like, oh shit
The house burned down across the street
I'm pretty sure it was a meth lab
But, you know
It's a good thing it didn't spread
Thank you fire department
When I was in grade school
I'm living in Martinez
Martinez has a huge
Ugly shell oil refinery
Behind it, for anyone that's ever been in Martinez
It looks very
Blade runner
It's very gross and huge
And that had an explosion
And I think like
Two or three workers unfortunately died
At the time, I was like 10 or 11 years old
When this happened
And again, the refinery is maybe
Four or five miles
And you can see the smokestacks of it
From out our kitchen window
And that actually shook the house
And I was very much aware of what was happening then
So, yeah
And I was probably playing my nest at the time
So
Yeah, I felt that one
But this one, two miles away
I was like
Wrath, wrath, wrath eclipse
Starfire, starfire, starfire
I didn't, I don't know
Alright, well look
We do want to make a donation to the victims of
San Bruno, which you know, we don't
Again, we don't mean to make fun of it
We're making fun of Alan and the fact that he missed it
And not making fun of what happened
Because it really is a tragedy
We do definitely want you to consider
Maybe making a donation to the Red Cross
To help the victims of the San Bruno fire
They can be reached at 1-800-RED-CROSS
Simply on the phone
And if you specify that you want to donate to the San Bruno fire
They will pass those donations along
You can also visit them on the web
There's also a specific website
www.redcrossbayarea.org
But Alan would appreciate it
If you sent him all your leet purples
And wow gold, correct?
And for those OLR listeners
Living in the Bay Area that have donated blood
That don't have ridiculous restrictions
Against them, that prevents them from donating blood
Which, archaic, archaic things
That need to be changed
But, you know
Unfortunately, we don't want to hold
Those silly restrictions against the victims
So we'll donate cash I guess
But definitely
Well thanks for calling
Hey, no problem, thanks for being on the show
Thank you for letting me make fun of you
See, this is why you rock
Thank you Alan
For letting me make fun of you a little bit on the show
I actually don't have a whole lot to add to that
My gaming week was kind of uninteresting outside of wow myself
If my neighborhood had exploded
I would have probably not noticed it either
Because I would have been doing the same thing
I did check out one new game though
The iPhone now has the Game Center
Right, just launched this week
Now Game Center is available on the iPhone
What a pointless thing
It doesn't do anything
And these are like two half-assed things
That Apple has launched lately between PING
Which is like, I think it's like Twitter
But it's not
Because all it really shows is the music
Game Room, you just have a friends list
And you can see what games they own
And what achievements they have
But I have yet to see how that whole
multiplayer integration works
Or anything like that
I don't get it
I haven't tried any of those
But because I'm a sucker and because I had credit
Still from gift cards I got for my birthday a few months ago
I downloaded one of the Game Center compatible games
It's a game called
Graal Classic Plus
And I was drawn to check out this game
Because the artwork kind of makes it look like
This little Legend of Zelda-y
Chibi type of game
And it said it was an MMO
I have a neat idea, like an MMO on the iPhone
That kind of looks like a Super Nintendo game, right?
Awesome? Oh my god
It's the worst thing I've ever played in my life
It is so stupid
Did you spend money on that?
Well, I spent someone else's money
Because it was gift cards
I spent $1.99 on that
And it is so stupid
It's one of those
It's the equivalent of one of those MMOs
That you would see the cards for at the grocery store
That you just kind of laugh out
By those, right?
It's worse than Farmville
Farmville's pretty awful
I don't understand
There's no quests
There's no leveling
It's just make a character and run around
Stabbing bushes, hoping you find
Little green gems in them
I think there's guilds
But the chat is all screwed up
It's just overcome with idiocy
And just people
Yelling weird things
On the road and trying to trick people
Into giving honor points
I don't get it
Why would anyone waste their time with this garbage
Well, I did, I guess
Boy, did I pick a stinker to test out Game Center with
So now I've decided Game Center is completely stupid
And a waste of time
Based on this one game that I played
So, yeah
That would be the one new game
That I checked out this week
Again, that's Brawl Classic Plus
Look, if you want to burn $2
It's one of those, I'm almost thinking it's so bad
You have to see it
If anybody can figure out the point of this game
I would love to hear from you
I would love to hear from the developers of this game
Of what it is they were trying to do with this game
Because I don't get it
Pull you into paying for it
Help
So there you go
Game Center, fail
Ping, fail
Brawl, whatever, plus plus, mega fail
Otherwise, it's just been more Warcraft
Oh, I did play Dead Rising
Case Zero myself
And it was fun
But I got eaten by a lot of zombies
Because I'm not very good at Dead Rising
Did the military kill you?
Did you find all the bike parts easily?
No, I was trying to get to the van with the Zombrex
And I got chewed up, I didn't get very far at all
But I liked that there were so many cut scenes
And everything in an arcade game
I thought that was kind of cool
That was pretty neat, I thought it was fun
Pitchfork, rifle, win
Alright
Let's see, going to
You know what, it just occurred to me what a cool weapon would be
Take like three broadswords and a pogo stick
And you'd have pogo stab
That would be awesome
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangesolentrader.com
Marissa Congusto, we love Marissa
I love her
Marissa, I love you
Alright, I'm going to poop on ping
She's pooping, get it?
She's going to poop on ping
Pooping
Because it censors tweets from artists
Such as Gaga's pro gay marriage tweets
Eye roll, it's useless
I didn't even know they did that
That would be a great name for a website though
Pooping
That's great
Somebody needs to register that
Oh yeah, it's like a copy of Twitter
Can somebody please explain to me the point of ping and game center
And the sad thing is they both sounded really good
Just like ping pals? Did that sound good too?
I'm thinking the word ping is just death for your service
I remember when ping
Coming next week, Orange Ping Radio
Was just, you know, on the other IRC screen where it just went ping, ping, ping
There was also an app for the iPhone for a limited time called ping
And it was like free SMS basically, to put it lightly
They changed their name a few months ago to ping chat
And they never said why, now I know
Because Apple probably said
You better change your name or we're going to pooping on you
So there you go
Maybe we can release an app called pooping
You know what, we should get someone who can program like that and do an app to make fun of it called pooping
Or cropping
It probably would not get approved by the app store
Maybe you could put it on Android
Like a social network called pooping
And it could be all about
Like, you know, because that's what Twitter is for
It's all for talking shit about people
Well no, you know how you make tweets when you go to the bathroom
I'm pooping right now
Or actually, well I noticed that the lovely Jessica Harper is in our chat right now
She's from Under Station Live
Which is live here at All Games this Saturday night
And I know she uses Foursquare to check in from her toilet
Because she actually has a location called sitting on the toilet
So I could see that being a use of like, pooping
Would be like, you know, sitting on the toilet
Or it could be like, it could be reviews of stalls around the nation
I ate lots of fiber today
This is really painful
Like, you know, Burger King bathroom, well cleaned
Smells like bleach
Anyhow, chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to join
And join in the madness
Marissa said that Steve Jobs said himself no more fart apps
Really?
That's a good thing, I think
We don't need any more fart apps
Alright, LightAmiga777 in chat says, OLR poop
Where there's smoke, they ping back
I think I get that
Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into some gaming news tonight
Oh, quick housekeeping
Add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio
We also have a Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR
And you should add us on those sites
And yeah, otherwise
I don't think there's a whole lot of news going on here
I'm gonna be out the first week of October
October 2nd, 3rd, somewhere in there
I'm gonna be gone that week
So I don't know if there'll be a show
Bring me pins
There can be
But I'm going to Gay Days at Disneyland
Bring me pins
Lots of them
I'm taking Alan for the first time since he was 18
I know
Don't worry, we're going back for Tron, remember?
December 17th is a big day
Yes, we are, but you still must bring me pins
I will
Maybe they'll have a Tron pin
If you find Tron pins, you better
I will
I will give you monies
For pins, for Tron
Alright, let's get into some actual bonafide gaming news
We're only like 40 minutes in this show
And haven't talked a lot about gaming news
Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?
Well, lots of stuff
Especially when it comes to PS3 and firmware
And all that fun stuff
Well, starting things off
You knew what was gonna happen
The Playstation 3 got a mandatory firmware
Bringing it up to 3.42
This firmware update does nothing
Other than break the PS
Jailbreak and the PS Groove hacks
And since this was
An overall security
Related issue
It says we will provide no further
Commentary to this case
Well, that's a
Wonderful thing to say
Fucking dick of a Sony rep
Well, to be fair
Well, why didn't they just say
We're not providing commentary
In this case, nah
They could just say, we don't like people hacking our consoles
Devil's advocate
A, they don't owe you shit for an explanation
B, maybe they plan to litigate against these people
So they don't want to say anything publicly
Because there's gonna be litigation in the future
I don't know if they can, because
I don't know, because the
Oh, come on, this is America, they can sue anyone
They can try, I guess
Shrine's important for them
Yay buttons, I don't know
Yaylawsuit.com
No new features, though
In this latest firmware, right?
The only feature is disabling this
If you are interested still in running
Homebrew stuff, and we will get to why
The homebrew is not all bad
Remember, it's just that backup device
That's the bad thing
Homebrew, not so bad
Of course, Sony just sees the backup device
And that's all they care about
So if you don't want to update to 3.41
Stay off the PlayStation Network
It's interesting, though
Because one of the things that actually
Did come around because of this
Is a way to enable
Any PlayStation 3 game
To be played as
A remote play game
On your PSP
Why they aren't like that in the first place
Is beyond me, but apparently
It's a really simple edit to
One of the files that's on there
That you basically
You can actually run this program called
A PS3 SFO editor
Once you have your game dumped
To the hard drive
And you just click a button that says
PSP Remote Play Available
And then click it and it will allow you to play
It over your PSP
Including games that don't allow it
Like, for example, Infamous
They actually have video of that
That's kind of neat
And a feature I don't see why they don't have
Maybe because it's buggy
In some games, I don't know, but
If it can be done
I don't know why they don't
Well, you kind of answered your own question
If it bugs in some games, that's gonna be enough
I think
It has to work consistently or they're not gonna implement it
I would think
Well, I don't know about that, but
Has it ever stopped developers from
Rushing out games?
Point taken
So, yeah, I don't know
And then, let's see
Other fun stuff
Of course, the PlayStation
Freedom
It is the port of the
PS Groove, I guess
It's basically the open source
Device or
Code that you can throw on
A USB stick
Well, the PS Freedom
Which was the one that's actually being ported
To the PSP
And everything else
Is actually available on quite a few different things
Including
The iPhone and iPod
That is, of course, if you have
Your phone or iPod
Jailbroken
And basically what this does is
It runs a modified
Program on the
Android operating system
There's all the different things that do it
That way
Which is kind of interesting
They actually have it ported
Funny enough
To the TI-84
Man, those calculators can do anything
Including
Wow, they still make those
That was the graphing calculator back in my day
Yeah
Or maybe it was the 82, I don't know, but still
Well, they had the 84s back in my day
But I think they're a little bit newer now
But yeah, they actually
You're officially 30 now, you're old
I'm sorry to interrupt, I've been told to make a small noise
Okay
What?
You can continue
Okay, other devices that the
PS Freedom has been ported to
The HTC Droid Incredible
The HTC Wildfire
The HTC Magic 32A
The Dream G1
Magic 32B
These are all HTC Foams
The Palm Pre
The Dingu
I actually have a Dingu
I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet
But I may try that
The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1
The Nokia N900
Or N800 or N810
The Droid
The Droid
Aris
Of course, the original
Oh, and the Palm Pre
Yeah, so basically
Everything
And if it's not out for your device
It will probably be ported to it
You know
I guess it's not such a bad thing if
You know, you're really interested
In actually putting this
You know, exploit on your console
It should be readily available
To do so
And if it's not for stuff that you may have
At home right now, it will be probably soon
I'm sure, you know
A piece of French toast will eventually be able to be
Used in hacking your
PS3, so
Just have to give it some time
I did forget to mention
Earlier in the show that because
You know, you're now officially 30, right Loki?
Yes I am
So now it's officially the gaming show for
30-somethings is Orange Lounge
Radio, that's right
The old crotchety video gaming show
We actually have a new theme song
For the new Orange Lounge Radio, we're gonna be debuting
Do we? Yeah, we should have done it tonight
But we'll do it next week
Since we're so old, here's our new theme song you guys
Thank you for being a friend
That old
Rob your dork
Back in my day
Oregon and
Trail was in green, and only green
And we liked it
Hey
On the DSI
There's a new firmware update as well
The 1.4.1U
It's a new update on the DSI firmware
Guess what it does?
Ah yes, it blocks piracy
And certain flash carts and all that stuff
Try to block piracy
Copying games is bad
I get that, but these types of things also block out
The homebrew, which is the really fun stuff
So anyway the new firmware update
On the DSI, it's the first update they've done
In about a year, no new functionality
It just does quote
Behind the scenes improvements to system
Performance, which means
Some of the flash cartridges that allowed
The lead hack source, no longer work
Some of the affected carts are
The ace card 2i, the super card
The DS2, the M3i0
The iPlayer, and the DSTTI
I didn't even know all these things existed
Did you know about the existence of
All these carts? I've never heard of half of these
Yeah
There's a lot of them out there, most people just
Know the R4
Some carts did manage to
Escape the patch
The iSmart DS, the EZ Flash
And the Hyper R4
Ah yes, the R4
So there you go
It's possible
That they will have like you know
Firmware updates to the actual cards themselves
That may re-enable them
It's a back and forth game
You know
I get it, I mean they
Have, they owe it to their developers
And they owe it to themselves to try and
Stop piracy
But it does kind of stink that there isn't at least
Some type of open channel for homebrew
I mean I feel like the only group
Whatsoever that has somewhat
Embraced homebrew
Granted in an ultimately controlled environment
Is Microsoft and the indie games
But even then that's really controlled
Or even Apple with their app store
Yeah even though apps have to go through
Scores and scores of approvals
But you know what? There's fart apps galore
And all this stupid shit
Can you imagine if these people were able to
Program apps for like say
The Nintendo DSi
I mean it may be a little bit more difficult
But
It would be really interesting
I'm surprised Nintendo's DSi doesn't try to
Cash in on the app craze
And I thought it was to some extent
They have the DSi store and so forth
They're so behind though
Open it up to let people make their own things
Make them charge 99 cents for it
And take half
Well how long did it take them to finally come out with WiiWare
I mean seriously
They're so behind
So I'm not surprised
But yeah
I'm bummed for the homebrew
It's a little harder to feel sympathy
For pirates
The jig is up kids
But for homebrew you're kinda like oh
Bummer
There's also another update to the Wii
System firmware as well
It's actually still marked as the current firmware
But it will remove all the
Homebrew that you have installed on your system
So
But does the exploit still work?
Or did they patch that too?
It goes in and takes out all the homebrew
They keep patching it and they keep finding ways
Around it so
Yes and no I don't know at this point
Interesting
It's not done with Legend of Zelda anymore
They can do it easier so
Well we'll see what firmware is released on a system
Next week that takes something away
Without adding anything
Dark Sakura in the meantime
What do you got for us in Other Worlds of Gaming?
We're actually having a discussion about food in the chatroom
What kind of food? Jewish food
Rollie pollie fish heads from Jessica Harper
That's not food I don't eat fish heads
Although I did eat something very unique
I had herring in sour cream
Was it good?
Yeah it actually was
But it was
Very interesting because they expected me to not like it
Or to make a face at it and I was like
This is pretty good I haven't
Eaten a whole lot of interesting food lately
We eat squirrel in Alabama Although
Alan cooked last night
It was really good
He did the chicken and his own little breadcrumb thing
It was really cute
I know
Now read the story
Read the damn story
That's so cute and gay
Well
For LittleBigPlanet 2
There is good news
That is if you played a lot of LittleBigPlanet
The first
And that is
The beta invites
Are going out but it's just for people
Who are super active in LittleBigPlanet
So I guess that they're
Checking
People who create upload
Who play regularly
So here's the major points
And also
They're not actually out recruiting
Beta testers
They're just sending the invites to people who play the game a lot
But some of those points are
You have to be 18 years or older
And be a resident
In a country which we operate
If you're reading the direct thing
Operate the Playstation store
The beta will be in English
So you have to provide feedback in English
And the beta test community
And the existing LittleBigPlanet
Beta testers will automatically
Be included in the beta trial
And it says
Please note that being selected for this beta
Does not give you access to other beta
Trials we may operate
The last thing is that participation
In the beta trials is subject to their beta
Trial agreement
Which I pretty much think means
Don't go spilling
All this crap to other people
Which is going to happen
I think that's a good way to do it
Because then they'll be
Giving it to people who understand the mechanics of the game
The more that you play something
Clearly the more you understand it
What Rob?
You looked funny
No I'm reading chat and having fun with them
But as far as
The way they're doing the beta invites
It makes sense, it's cute
It's a good way to do it
I didn't really get that much into LittleBigPlanet
I know I'm not getting invited
But why not
Get your hardcore community in there
Because they're the ones that are
A. Gonna most be shocked by the changes
And B. Probably test it the most
It makes sense
I'm surprised they don't do the same thing with World of Warcraft
Well maybe that is how they send out the invites
There's other ways you can get one
I got one, I probably shouldn't have it
But I do
Touch you
I actually haven't played it a whole lot
A lot is still borked in the World of Warcraft beta
What I really want in right now
Is the DC Universe beta
That's what I really want to play right now
You're not going to play Star Trek Online
You need to give that card to someone who will
I'll give it back if you really want it
I'll check it out someday
You have to play with me
In ten days
We'll go kill some Borg and smack some Klingons around
It'll be fun
Good times
There's got to be at least one other OLR listener that plays Star Trek Online
We'll have to hunt down Travis
Does he?
I would play just to attack his ship in the middle of the night
You'd have to play a Klingon
Rob!
I think you'd have to play a Klingon
Really?
And that means you'd actually have to level up a character
To I think Lieutenant Commander
The half Klingon, half human
You can sort of make one
You get this selection
I don't know how we got from Little Big Planet
Oh, we just broke the show with too much nerdiness
Oh, that's too bad
You get an option to choose
Alien
And then you can customize them however you want them to look
I see
Alright, let's move on Loki
Well, digital distribution seems to be
Catching on everywhere else
So why not the arcade?
I'm just going to at least try it
And they've introduced a new digital distribution system
Called Nesica X Live
And this was being shown off
At the 48th amusement machine show
In Chiba
And apparently
It will allow arcade operators
To purchase cabinets
And then download games to the cabinets
Including a bunch of older titles
As well as brand new releases
They said that 9 arcade game makers
Are supporting the platform
Including SNK
And CAVE
And the first title release for the system
Will be none other than Taito's
BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2
And
That's kind of interesting
I don't know if they'll ever make it out over here like that
I don't see why not
I don't know
It kind of makes me wonder though
I assume this is going to be very similar to
How they have the CPS2
And 3 systems and stuff like that
Where it's just a cartridge based
System but instead of a cartridge
It's going to be a hard drive with
A programmer
Or I guess actually the new Taito system
Is actually run off of a Windows XP system
I just have a feeling
These will be easily dumped
And stolen because
Well no seriously if you think about it
Because it's going to have
The same front end
That's going to be running all these games
And all you're going to be doing is exchanging out
The actual
Game data
So if you
Put out that
Program
Then people are going to be able to
Just dump the game data and all these
Arcade games will leak
Despite all this back alley stuff that you're talking about
When it comes to this system
What do you think of this system as a way to possibly
Revitalize arcades? I think it's a neat idea
It's kind of like taking something from the home
Consoles that's working well and putting it in arcades
Haven't we seen this happen to some extent already
Like a little bit
Like I know some of the later Bamani games do this
With the whole emusment and so forth
And I think Technica does the same thing
And I even think some of the fighting games are doing this now
With some type of digital delivery right?
I think it's a good idea in the sense that it will
Save arcade operators at least
If they were to implement this in the states
A whole lot of
Shipping costs because shipping
Arcade games is not cheap
At all and
Is that first hand?
Yes somewhat
I know that too because I priced
Trying to get a baby pacman machine
Because that's how bad I wanted one
And honestly the machine itself I could afford
It was the shipping that was going to kill me
To get one of those machines
That's how bad I want that stupid machine
A baby pacman?
I know
I'll track one down for you
Finding one locally maybe
That would be cool
Shipping is expensive
So um
I mean granted that they wouldn't be shipping
A new cabinet each time
They would just be doing a cartridge
Or something like that
If it were any other system
But even still
That's one less expense
They have to deal with
Although then they have to have internet
So maybe it evens itself out
But at least when a game is released
They can have it there relatively quick
Because you know if you were overnight
A cabinet from you know
Japan or something like that
That would cost millions of dollars
That boat would have to go very fast
To get the machine over here
Speed boat
You'd have to get Johnny Quest
To get that machine out here that fast
Alright
Well I think it's a really interesting
Idea and I could see arcades going that way
But is it going to be enough to save them?
I don't know
No one gives a crap how the games get to the arcade
It's just what games are at the arcade
What do you think they could do
And we have this conversation once in a while
On the show and I'll open this up to the chat too
What do you think they could do to an arcade
To make people come back?
Give them something that they can't get at home
With consoles
That's really it
Right now it's very difficult
To come up with that kind of stuff
Because
Lately it's community
For the past ten years or so
It's the DDR community obviously
What this show owes its roots to
Or fighting game communities
You can't readily get that stuff at home
You can buy some homemade
Or really expensive dance pads
And stuff
But it's still not the same as the arcade
But now
With Guitar Hero and stuff
Guitar Freaks is kind of
A done deal
And the Guitar Hero arcade game
Is just dumb
S2-100 Matt in chat says free blowjobs
Insert quarter, insert wiener
That's not an arcade game
Okay, that's a peep show
Free spankings
Or like an Asian massage parlor
That is not an arcade
Now they put an arcade in
Was that during the part of the marathon
You were here for?
I don't think I was here for any part of the marathon
I don't remember if it was in the first three hours
I think that you were gone
But Rob played this funny YouTube video
It was Allen
The happy ending
I'll find it, keep talking
Get ready to wreck
So
I don't know if there's a lot they can do to revitalize
It's just basically bringing out games that are
Going to be
Able to do stuff that you can't
Really do at home
You know the big old gun games
Just giving people a reason to come to the arcade
Kind of
This is from Mediocre Films on YouTube
They get full credit for this
Mediocre Films is the name of the YouTube here
This is called
Happy ending
Here you go, Loki
Link it in the chatroom too
You like?
Ohh
She's sitting on his butt
I love the generic Asian restaurant music
They play in the background
Don't overplay
She just took her dress off
You liking this, Loki?
Good movie, huh?
His head is totally not laying on that right
You're not supposed to lay on the little
Happy ending
Okay
Okay
Happy ending
There's like clowns and a juggler
And puppets
And balloons
This is what they need at arcades
And they all leave
She's clapping
Are you happy now?
It wasn't what I was hoping for
Oh no
Maybe you want a hand jive
$50
For a
Hand jive, right?
Yeah, hand jive
Yeah, okay
Okay
Hand jive
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Get into hand jive
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Like grease
See, wasn't that worth derailing the entire show to watch?
Yes it was
Wasn't that awesome radio making the listeners
Listen to a movie?
It's hilarious
Please show that to Nelly when you get home
I will
Tell her we send it with love
Speaking of things that don't make sense
Just like us playing a video
On a radio show
The PSP Go
Did you like that segue?
That was an excellent segue
Kazurai, the PS boss
Of course
This week has admitted
In an interview with
MCVUK.com
That the $250
Pricing could perhaps
Have been the problem
Behind the sale
Matter of fact it was a poor design
In the first place
Let me give you the quote here
Which Darkcoagackenchat calls the PSP No
Quote
I think we need to make sure we have as many titles
Available to download as possible
To make the experience as easy as possible
But also pricing
Is perhaps an issue
Because of the cost reductions
We've been able to do over the years
The traditional PSP has benefited
But the PSP Go is a completely different design
So the cost trend is different
So
There you go
No I don't
Was maybe pricing the problem with the PSP Go
You think possibly
Perhaps that you put out a skew with
Less features
And then
I don't know, offered it for a more
Expensive price
And then I don't know
Just utterly stopped supporting it
Because you know you haven't really
Released any sort of bundles
Oh that's because you can't bundle anything with it
Because it doesn't have a UMD drive
To play the games that would be bundled with it
Ah fun
You could give a card for a free download
Yeah everybody likes cards
Dungeon buster in our chat room says
Thank you for giving me work to do
And I have to go online and download the title
Dungeon buster in our chat room
At chat.orangeslawnsherd.com says
I love how Sony spins failure
That was a good spin of failure don't you think
Perhaps, perhaps
Just maybe
It was possibly the fact
That the pricing
Is what ruined it
Perhaps
I'm not sure
We have some analysts we're paying money to look into right now
But perhaps
Let me tell you for free
Yes that was the issue
It was definitely the pricing
Was the issue
The pricing for flimsy piece of crap
I saw a PSP go in one of those fancy vending machines the other day
It kind of made me laugh a little bit
Well there was somebody in one of my history classes that had it for class
And I said okay you gotta let me see that
So I tried playing a little bit
That mic is not your friend right now
What? I'm holding it together
I'm just saying it's cutting in and out
I don't write the rules of electronics
I just tell you what it is
Rob
Rob
Yes person in your electronics class
At any rate
I got to play one because a guy in my
One of my history classes
Was playing one and I said you gotta let me
Try it and I was like yeah
Piece of crap
I'm sorry you're not going to appreciate this but I know we're talking about
The PSP go right now and it really smells like
Shermie took a caca like is it just me
That smells that
She went go
I want to see if she really did take
She did
Shermie does not like the
PSP go
Your cat has
Impeccable comic timing
I just want to say
I don't think dark soccer appreciates that
Shermie
Bad kitty
I don't think we're allowed to talk about the PSP go anymore
Shermie
has therefore ended the conversation by
Taking a dump
In the middle of the floor
It stinks that dark soccer
Has the next story so we'll just
We'll just sit here and think about that for a moment
Hi
Poopy butt
Okay and you want to know
I have to say this
For the amount of stink that comes out of that cat's ass
Her poop
Her little poop
Was about the size of an Ikea meatball
Thank you for that comparison
Sweetest meatballs will never be the same
That means that she couldn't even give
A full sized cat crap
About the PSP go
I love my cat
And she's sitting under the pinball table like
I did it
Her little sassy fat butt
So need for speed MMO
Have you played it?
I haven't
He actually really likes it but you can only get up to level 10
Before you have to actually pay for it
But not anymore
Because need for speed world
Once it hit 1 million registered users
It actually is now free to play
No more charge
But
You still have to buy boosts
And double XP bonuses and that type of thing
So
I hate the word
The combination microtransaction
I just think it's stupid
A transaction
Is a transaction
I'm just saying all those media sites use it
It's just kind of one of those things
And they're all stupid
A transaction is a transaction
Oh and it's like the gods above
Just pulled the cord on your mic
Ugh
Sony dislikes your comments about their transaction
A transaction is a transaction
They should just call it
Payment
You have to pay for this stuff
Money is money
A little money is still money
Damn you people
So is the game fun? I'm interested in it
Dan likes it
And he likes doing the
Getting the bonuses where you run through
Police barriers and that type of thing
You know
It gives you points for
How many cops get injured I guess
Which is kind of wrong
But you know
It's actually pretty cool
I think they have just a couple of
Cars that you can pick from right now
At least at the level that he's at
But it's like playing Need for Speed on the system
Except you just
Truck all over the town on your computer
He likes it
He says that he would rather play it with a wheel
Than use the
Keyboard like he's been doing
The keys gotta stink
Maybe a 360 controller would work better though
Maybe a little better than the keys
Zebun Artarum says you guys gotta get a new mic
I think, I hope it's not the mic
That's the newest mic in the studio
It's probably the cord, not the mic
Something maybe happened where the mic fell
Or something and shorted
One of the wires, I don't know
It slides out just a little bit
I think that I just need to get a new mic cable
Yeah, hopefully that's it
Or we could take the mic cable from a working mic
That might be the solution
That one's not detachable
Yeah it is, at the bottom
Maybe we could try that during the break and see if that works
I can hold it
I can hold it, I'm a big girl
Let's travel around the world
And look at some release dates
And what's coming to a console near you
We'll start in the USA

Just saying
I wouldn't let my girl read that
And the party is just getting started
Would you let your girl read Twilight?
Hell no
Do you enjoy being glamorous
Extravagant
And posh
But she could be glamorous, extravagant
And posh
I would rather her be intelligent
Confident
And not having to conform to anything like that
This gash is for you
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

The best selling book series
Is now coming to life
On your Nintendo DS and DSi

That's what she's really gathering the supplies for
I thought you said Dark Tattoo, sorry
Truth or Lies
It's a game
On the PS3, Xbox 360
And the Wii
You
Are challenged to
Lie to your friends I guess
I don't really know what the hell the point of this is
Bring the party into your living room
Inspire hilarious discussions and learn about your friends
As deep dark
Secrets are revealed
It's time to uncover who is telling the truth
And who is flat out lying
I'm guessing that it has some sort of way to tell
If you're a liar or not
Maybe, otherwise this game is lame
AkumaJP suggests Fancy Nancy's happy ending
Fancy Nancy's hand job
Or Fancy Hand Job I guess
Legends of the Guardian
Owls of Gahool coming out on
Playstation 3, Xbox 360
Wii and DS this week
That tie in with the brand new animated movie
Finish in Ferb
Right again on the DS
If you like that cartoon series I guess
Dark Sacros is like yelling for the other room
What?
I freaking love Phineas and Ferb
That show is crack
I would play a game
And she has
Sipped the
Disney Kool-Aid
Racket Sports coming out on
Playstation 3 this week
This is very similar to the game
That was out on the Wii
It's like Wii Sports
Lord of the Rings
Aragorn's quest on the
Playstation 2, the PS3
The Wii, the DS and the
PSP, of course the PS3 version
Works with the Playstation Move
And is equally lame
Gladiator begins
Not a prequel to the
Gladiator movie but it is
A gladiator combat game
There are a lot of games I don't care about
Coming out this week
Me too and I'm covering all of them
Alpha and Omega
Alpha and Omega, it's a DS game
Whatever, and Jesus
US release has been going on for like an hour
Halo Reach comes out this week
Hey
Halo Reach is a mature game
There are a lot of mature
Chatters, chat room
Quick poll, Halo Reach
Or Fancy Nancy
Please let me know
I will have you know that this is the second time that a Halo game
Has come out against Cabela's
Maybe this year Cabela's will take it
Oh
Anyways
Oh and Cabela's
Did have a version with a gun for the Wii
Alright I'm almost done
Gourmet D the Lords of
Nature coming from Konami on the Wii and
The DS, I don't even know what that is nor do I care
Yu-Gi-Oh
50's dual
Transfer on the Wii
Yay
Of course the Halo Reach will be out in the
Legendary and Limited Editions as well
A game called Swords on the Wii
Wonder what you do in that
That's a
That's a tough one there
Let me give you the results
Of our quick poll
Fancy Nancy or Halo Reach, you ready?
Fancy Nancy Milthouse
Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club
Halo Reach, Fancy Nancy, Reach
Fancy Nancy, Reach, this is sad
It's split 50-50
Fancy Halo Reach, Fancy Nancy
Reach around, I'd much rather have
Fancy Nancy, Reach
Fancy Nancy download content for
Halo Reach, I almost said Hello Reach
Fancy Nancy, Reach
Fancy Nancy's pap smear
Fancy Nancy please
More like Halo Reach around
Etc, etc, it's half and half
I don't know what to think about that
Well
I don't know, and two last things
The Fantasy Star Portable on the PSP
And finally, it's not really a game
But it's coming out this week, the PlayStation Move
And all the wonderful components for that
And
A goddamn thing on this website
Says that, you know
There's stupid
Sports champions
Or whatever game
Is out, despite the douchebag
And the GameStop saying
Well it doesn't come out until the 17th
Yeah the bundle doesn't come out until the 17th
You idiot
Are you done? Are you finished?
Are you finished? Are you sure?
Hey, going to Japan
And looking at what's coming out, the Japanese release dates
Yay
Halo Reach also comes out in Japan this week
On September the 15th, front mission evolved
September the 16th
In Japan, those are both on, of course on the Xbox 360
Moving on over to the
PlayStation 3
See I don't know, is
Halo Reach as big of a deal overseas as it is here
I would think
It's still like
It's like a B game
It's up there but not like way up there
PlayStation 3, front mission evolved
Is there as well
As well as Mobile Suit Gundam Senkai
Record UC 0081
That's just a price reduction though
That game's actually already been out
Moving over to the Nintendo Wii and seeing what
Glorious games they're getting over there in Japan
Let's see
Deca Sports 3 is this week
Wii to Sports 10
Shimoku comes out this week in the pretty popular
Deca Sports series, that series does pretty well for Hudson
Doesn't it?
It's like Wii Sports never dies
Nothing really notable on the PlayStation 2
But I do have the Nintendo DS
Jinsai Game QDS
Heisei no Dekigoto
That is also a price reduction that's moving into the best
Otherwise not a lot of new games this week
Although on the 18th, there's all these
Like new covers coming out
If you want to get covers for your
DSI in different colors, you have that to look forward to
Ooh, this ought to be good though
On the Sony PSP, here's a big week
Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5
Cause I know there's some Closet Yu-Gi-Oh! fans out there
Dissida Final Fantasy Universal Tuning is ultimate hits
So Square sometimes does this with their games
They put out kind of like an international version later on
I'm assuming it's kind of this version of this
Also a game called Blue Roses
Yosai to Aoi Hitomi no Senshi Tashi comes out this week
Oh, I think that's uh, hold on
It's Blue Roses
It's a strategy game
I was looking at the title
Oh sorry, it's an RPG pretty much
This game's from Nippon Ichi Entertainment
Who makes a lot of the games
Just looks like your typical Japanese RPG honestly
With your little anime cutscenes
It looks cute, looks cute
I'm sure there'll be some people that want to import that
That's it for Japanese releases
How about The Old Kingdom?
Oh, we have a number of things over there
Taylor Reach, and then Legend of the Guardians
The Owls of Gahool
Oh, that's not from that book
That was that movie, right?
A book and a movie, yeah
There's Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Swamp
Final Fantasy Tactics
The War of the Lions on iPhone
Sounds fun
Flight Control, Kung Fu Rider
and PlayStation Move on the 15th
As well as also on the 15th
Sonic Adventure for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
And Sports Champions
And Start the Party
And closing up the week
On the 17th we have Lionheart
King's Crusade on PC
R.U.S.E
And Two Worlds 2
Of course, there's a game coming out next week
That totally makes me laugh by the name Deathspank
That's funny
Nice
Quick question from your chatroom
Spyro's asking, what about Final Fantasy 14?
I believe it's out in two weeks on the PC
At the end of the month
Yeah, and my list for Japanese releases doesn't cover the PC
So I'm not sure when it's coming out of there
PlayStation 3 is not until next year
And I think that's the same
Be it Japan or the U.S.
I think PC is getting the first crack at that
And Collector's Edition is what, the 22nd?
I think regular people get in on the 30th
I'm a little skeptical about Final Fantasy 14
I don't know, I'm weird though
I feel like I need to buy it
I need to give the retail game a good old fashioned college try
I need to try it
And see what I really think of it
But then again, I'm like, oh wow, but that beta was so bad
But I don't know
I'm really torn, that's where I'm at
We'll see, to be continued
It really depends, probably like, do I have money to spend on Final Fantasy 14 or not
That's really what it's going to come down to, probably
Alright, let's move on with some other news
We're going to talk to Game of the Week here in just a little bit
Here on the show, Loki
Ah yes, so
It's kind of interesting
For the longest time I remember
Apple was so
Adamant about not
Supporting Flash in
Their applications, well
That may change soon actually
They're going to relax some of the
IOS
Development restrictions
Including the
Use now of third party
Tools like Flash CS5
So apparently
New apps now can be developed with that in mind
That's kind of cool
So maybe
I don't know, we'll get some more apps that way
Maybe a better web browser
Does that mean it's easier to make apps now
Because people have been asking for an
OLR app for forever
I'm kind of like, I don't know
Flash I guess
I don't know what to put in an OLR app
Did it ever get put back in the store though?
I heard that it was gone from the store
For a little while, I don't know if it ever came back
I don't know. What else would be on an OLR app
That's not already on the all games app
I don't know. I can think of a few things
I know one of the other shows I've seen
Out there does like special shows
That you get if you buy the app
But I don't know
I don't know how I feel about that. We're too lazy for that
Yeah, and it's always kind of been like, you know, we've always put
Everything out there for free, I would feel bad to suddenly
Make, like if we're going to make people pay for things
We need to get those stupid shirts done
Or something like, you know, something really really extra
Beyond audio and video content
Which we've always done for free, you know
Not dogging on other shows
I, you know, everybody's got to
Pay the bills somehow, it's just, you know
We've never really made money off this show
And I don't think we're ever going to
And that's fine. It is what it is
Darktide Studio suggesting an
OLR and a USL combined soundboard
Now, okay, now that
I could, that's something a little extra
Perhaps, perhaps, we'll see
Alright, moving on
Let's see, oh, I like this
Oh, and Tigerclaw confirms the All Games app
Is still not back on the App Store
Well, maybe we need to put an app up there
Just so that there's something to tune into the radio show
On the go, I don't know, although I think Video Game
Outsiders have one
And that show's plenty fine, I like what they do over there
Mario
It's a hacky Mario game
Not really, more like a homebrew Mario game
It's created by Ben Weber
He's a candidate for his PhD in computer science
He goes to UC Santa Cruz
He's programmed a game
And it uses sprites from Super Mario World
So you could say it's homebrew
But what this game does is it's called
Infinite Adaptive Mario
And the level starts with
Moderate difficulty
But once you beat that, the next level gets harder
And gets harder and harder
Until you die three times in a row
Without completing a level
When it gets easier
And by the way, harder means yes, it gets
A lot harder
According to Weber, Infinite Adaptive Mario
Scales up difficulty by increasing
The frequency of gaps
Average size of gaps, variation of ground height
And a number of enemies
So in other words, as you get
Smarter, so does the game
And in some cases
If you look at some of these screenshots
There's like 16 monsters on the screen at once
Including piranha plants
That just fly in mid-air
That seems really hard
That looks crazy, I was looking at it
The author put Infinite Adaptive Mario
Up against an AI program
That completes randomly generated Mario levels
And there's this whole YouTube
On how that goes
That sounds kind of interesting actually
You can download it on
The website for UC Santa Cruz
But it is a little bit buggy
But that's kind of interesting
Although, I kind of think
Hasn't Nintendo gone that direction
A little bit, like games don't get
Harder necessarily, but didn't they put in
That controversial quote unquote system
A little while back where the levels get
Easier, or I guess the tutorials
Luigi tutorials come up if you're
Screwing up, like wasn't that in the Mario
Versus game, the new Super Mario Brothers
Wii, if you die like 8 times
In a level then you get the Luigi tutorial
Kind of interesting huh?
That's the, you suck
So we're going to teach you not to suck
Exactly
Uh, Loki you're playing that right now
I see you, I see you over there
You're playing it right now aren't you
I think he is, I was going to yeah
Except they don't tell you what the buttons are
Which makes it difficult, oh that might be kind of difficult
Alright hey uh
Let's get to the classic
Game of the week, it's a segment here on the show
Where we take a trip down memory lane
With the help of Dark Sakura and her gaming vault
To say hey
Here's a video game you little brats
Should be playing this week
And it's not Mario this week unfortunately
It's not related to this, but it is pretty cool right
Dark Sakura, Ice Cream Man
Oh yeah the Ice Cream Man
The Ice Cream Man's outside, I can't do the segment bye
No I'm kidding
Okay
Yes the classic game of the week is
Moonwalker
Specifically Michael Jackson's Moonwalker
Cause you know not to be confused with
Paula Abdul's Moonwalker
I'm going to start off on the arcade version
Cause the arcade version is
It's been hard to find lately
And it's different of course than the one we all remember on the Genesis
Which I think is pretty cool
Um
At any rate going with the arcade version
Um
You start off on sort of uh
It's technically side scrolling
But it goes
Diagonally
And you uh
It is a beat em up, you have magic powers
To attack with instead of actually just punching them
And you can shoot magic at them
And uh
You can also turn into the big robot
From uh
Which is the best thing ever
Yeah
And um
The player one is Michael in the white suit and hat
And then with the blue shirt
And then second player is
Red with white
And the third one is black with red
And they have those armands
You know that Michael Jackson is going to be really fond of
Um
Did you hear Michael's little scream there in between stages?
Wow
Hold on one more time
He saves the kid, he goes in the door
And then there's a cut scene
Round 2
Amusement quarter
Here we go, here we go
Wow
Although I love this little version of Smooth Criminal
That plays in the background
Let's listen to a little bit of it
Anyway
Um, of course he's got the uh
The dance magic
Which um, is sort of I guess
The smart bomb for the game
And uh
Basically um
You all get this sort of on screen
Logo
That you can activate it and then a spotlight lands
On you and you start to dance
Like regular
Michael Jackson moves
And then all the enemies on the screen start dancing
With you
And then they pass out because they
Can't keep up with Michael Jackson's
Smooth moves
Um, but it doesn't um
The bosses don't dance
They just take a lot of damage
And on screen children are not harmed of course
Michael has to rescue the kids
And then um
One of his power ups is Bubbles the Champion Z
And Bubbles
Is in each level and every time
You rescue
Rescue him he turns you into the giant robot
And then you can shoot lasers
Now
For the console
Of course this is what I'm sure people remember a lot
More of is uh
The one that came out on the Genesis
And
I like this one
Because when you go and do the dance magic thing
When you're standing on the piano everyone does the whole
Smooth criminal dance and that was just sweet
But that one was
Pretty cool and to go back to the
The uh songs that were in the game
For the arcade version the cavern one was bad
And the amusement quarter is smooth criminal
The night street is beat it
Graveyard is another part of me
And the evil fortress is uh
Another version of bad and then Billy Jean
Plays in the credits
And then on the Sega Genesis one
Which is more standard side scroller
Uh the stage one
Is smooth criminal
Stage two is beat it, stage three is another
Part of me, stage four is Billy Jean
And then you can perform like part of bad
And then stage five is bad with your special
Performance being smooth criminal beat it
Thriller if you have the REV-00
Version
Or another part of me which is the
REV-01
And uh he shouts
Woo
And in some of the cut scenes he says
Who's bad?
But he says his usual
Little catch phrases
And then um
But for the ad for the
Sega Genesis version it
Said that thriller was supposed to be
In the game but
It wasn't it's just the dance
Attack that's in
That one version in the
Last stage
Of course this isn't the only
Game that Michael Jackson has made appearances in
Uh there there was you know
Space channel five and space channel five part two
And he was a secret character and ready
To rumble boxing round two
So uh
That's pretty cool
But there was um
Also uh
Did you know that they were
Working on Michael Jackson
The experience game to be out on
Xbox 360? Yes it's um
Coming out it was gonna be out later this year
But I think it got pushed back next year now
It better be just like Moonwalker
I think it's supposed to be just like
Just dance
And singing in it
The game actually has
A rating on for
The PEGI has a rating for Wii's
Virtual console so
There's a talk that it should be out um
In Europe
So that's pretty cool
Cool game
Alright I don't care if people say it sucks
I completely disagree
No it was a cool arcade game
On the Genesis it was a little wonky but it was
You know it was Michael Jackson
It's all about the dance
But the best Michael Jackson game is space channel five part two
Oh yeah
Especially when you break out into the whole thriller dance
Oh that was awesome
Alright there it is your classic game of the week
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker for the arcade
Although Dark Soccer did reference the Genesis version as well
So that's gonna do it for part A of our
Program but it's not over yet guys
We got plenty more show to come
Your phone calls, your emails, rapid fire news
And the tweets on Twitter
Talk of Guitar Hero invading the Twitters
And Rock Band 3 information
And a new character confirmed for Marvel vs
Capcom 3 this week
We're gonna talk about all of that when we come right back with more
Of Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
It is episode number 381
Live on this Sunday evening
September the 12th of 2010
We are live of course at All Games Radio
Where we do tape our show live every Sunday night
At 6 o'clock Pacific
9 o'clock Eastern right after
The Bobby Black Wolf show
Although next week he's not gonna be here
Sad
So it'll just be us next Sunday holding down the fort
But you know what that means
We can take over the stream early if we want
We can take over the stream early
And then go to bed early
Bobby assured me that there's no best of
Or anything next week so
And the chatters are requesting another marathon
Okay
No, are you crazy?
We're not doing another marathon
I'll go live early though
I'll go live early
You can do a marathon, you can broadcast all day long
And then I'll come in at 6 o'clock
As will Loki
Alan may be here next week I'm not sure
Okay
Coming in right in the middle of the rebirth
Of Pump Up the Volume
Good times
Maybe
On our Twitter
Run my dear
They're already asking for an OLR-thon too
Too much
If you do it too much then it loses its effect
It needs to stay like a once a year type of thing
Of course then again this show as it is
Has already been going what 8 and a half years
So if we even make it another year that in itself
Is something to celebrate so that'll be good
Think we'll make it to 10 years? That's a long time
That'll be good Why not?
It's only 2 more years
Not even 2 more whole years
We might make it to 10 years
You have coffee?
Nescafe do you want some? Is it decaf?
Yes
It's good Alright I'll try some
Fine I don't have any creamer to put in
Except for rice milk
I don't know if I have any left
Sure why not if you're offering
Woot I'm getting coffee
And you're getting rapid fire news
Quick stories that uh
We didn't fit anywhere else in the show
Loki
Walmart has a listing for an eco
Shadow of the Colossus
Kind of a
Classic I don't know if you call it
Rema HD compilation
That's gonna be on the Playstation 3
Um
I could see that happening
And I doubt that they would make up stuff so
It's possible
I bet we'd see it come out around the same time
As The Last Guardian so um
They may be jumping the gun
A little bit though
But at least that's on there right now
Other news
There is rumors that Frank
West may be in
Dead Rising 2 as well
And this is coming from the
Kind of a teaser site
I guess it's a little bit viral
Called tape it or die
Um
Where apparently they have uh
Some fictional characters Johnny Pipes
Uh recounts seeing someone
else fighting by green side
So I go after him he says
Um but then I see some other dude
Uh vaguely recognized him
Maybe saw him at a party a few years back
Maybe a celebrity can't remember his name though
Phil Floyd regardless
He was fighting zombies
Um too it was like Oktoberfest
But replaced the beer with zombies
And drinking with slaughter
It was like I died and gone to heaven
Um
And of course I believe in one of the
Screenshots where they have these like
Photos or whatever um
I thought I saw Frank West actually in there
Yes he is actually in that
Photo so
I think it's inevitable he has to make a cameo
Somewhere in the game you know what I mean
Like he's gotta be in it or people are just gonna be
Pissed
And also there's two player co-op
Oh they haven't said what the second player is?
Nope
In the demos it's been just you played another
Chuck Green but
Perhaps Frank West
Perhaps they'll charge you 500 points as DLC
Perhaps they will have like a second
The second quest
As you like to put it
Where you can play as Frank West
I think more games need
Second quests
Like the original Legend of Zelda
Wow that's a hot cup
Um
Console modder Ben Heck
Is getting his own show starting
September 13th
You may remember him from
Such wonderful console mods
As the Atari 2600
Portable
And all the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3
Laptops he's made
He does a lot of modding for different
Game controllers and what not
But he will have his own show
Appear on apparently
An internet TV channel called
Revision 3
And I guess
The one that does all the dig shows
Maybe and it's also
Gonna be hosted on Element 14
So
It's interesting
Will it be on actual television?
Don't know, should though
It'll be on Apple TV
That's where it'll be
Did the cat poop again?
DarkSakura just found a surprise
Aw poor thing
Any other quick stories
Loki, or should I move on here
Ah that's all I have
How about something about Final Fantasy
Dissida, you know a lot of you guys are really big fans of this game
It was pretty cool little
Final Fantasy fighting game
Well they've just announced
Dissida Duodecim
I guess is how you pronounce this
It's all Latiney words
Yes it is in the issue of Shonen Jump
Which is one of those magazines overseas
It's a sequel to Dissida Final Fantasy
It'll be coming out on Japanese PSPs
In 2011
Dissida Duodecim Final Fantasy
We don't know any new characters yet
Except for Final Fantasy 4's
Kane and Final Fantasy 13's
Lightning
That'll be cool, no other players have been confirmed
Yet, but I imagine most of the roster
From the first Dissida game
I know a lot of my friends are big fans of this game
So I'm sure they're going to be excited about that
More news on that when we know it
Meanwhile, for you Mac gamers
And I know there are some of you
You missed out on Grand Theft Auto 3
When it was the shit
Well miss out on this no more
Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas
A big pack of games is coming out later this year
That is confirmed from Rockstar's
Facebook for the Mac
I don't have a date yet or anything like that
But for you Mac gamers who missed out on that
I'm sure you're excited
And I know Dark Soccer is going to be first in line
For one of these on September 21st
For the low low price of $54.99
A pink
DualShock 3
Yay!
How do you like that?
I think I like cleaning up Shermie's poop better
Actually, I'll tell you something really cool
Let's listen to another podcast
I'm terrible because I forgot the name
And the gamer Edie's on, I like her
She's a friend of the show
GameHounds, that's what it's called
I was listening to her show and she was interviewing the guys that made the Tron game
At PAX because she was up at Penny Arcade Expo
Where all the cool kids were except for us
There is a Tron Playstation 3 controller coming out
That glows blue
And the minute I heard that I'm like, want
Need, must have
There's something other than that coming out
Something I covered for Geek Life, plug plug plug
Geek-Life.com
The collector's edition with the bike?
There's a keyboard and mouse coming out
That has the blue lighting on it
And the mouse is like one of those super nice
Cushioned, ergonomic
Really happy mice
I am such a consumer whore because I want all of it
I really do, I want the little PS3 controller
I want the keyboard, I want the mouse
I want the collector's edition of the game
I'm sad
If anyone wants to read about it you can go to
Geek-Life.com and look up my Geek Cube article
From a couple weeks ago
The shameless plug alarm
Is going off
It's all good
I will have to go read about that right now
While Dark Soccer
Does some other stories
Ruining my fun, Rob
Well
And this is actually really cool
We were talking about this not too long ago
Borderlands
Is getting a free update that will raise
The level cap and rebalance the game
Oooh
And it's of course across all the platforms
Xbox 360, PS3, PC
And this was announced
At PAX by the way
And the download content pack is called
Claptrap's New Robot Revolution
And
It's
It's going to be, I think, pretty good
There were some issues
With, you know, the way the game played
I thought, I mean otherwise it was still really fun
And also
They just said it was
Going to be the level cap at
69
That's funny
It's going to be out
It'll be released around October 12th
When the Game of the Year edition comes out
Kuma JP in chat just said the Xbox
Is getting one of those Tron controllers too
Damn it! That's another thing I'm going to have to buy now
Shit
And then
For next week's Rock Band download content
We've got some new stuff
We have Holy Diver by Dio
We have Stand Up and Shout by Dio
We have Nirvana
Juliana Hatfield
I haven't heard any of her stuff in a long time
Wow, she's still around making music?
I haven't heard her since like college
I think this is an older one
Irish Blood English Heart by Morrissey
I love Morrissey too
This is totally like my
College music
This is music snob week, like it really is
These are all the like, my music is better than yours
Artists
Straight Lines by Silverchair
That's another group I listened to when I was like first going to college
This Charming Man
That was like the one male anorexic that we've ever heard of
Was the guy in Silverchair
This Charming Man by the Smiths
It's also like Morrissey week
And Writing on the Walls
Under Oath
Okay, I might have to get some points
The list looks pretty awesome to me
Which of course
They're going to be
Now, the dollar amount is really all the same for them
But the Morrissey
The one that's
Irish Heart English Blood
This Charming Man and Writing on Walls are going to be
160 Microsoft points each
While the others are 200
Wii points
They're all going to be on
All the platforms, so
And then, last but not least
This is kind of funny, I think
Is that they're putting out
A
Wiimote
That's going to be coinciding
With the Wii title
Doctor Who Return to Earth
It's getting a Sonic Screwdriver
Wii controller, and I think that's awesome
It's of course based after
The current 11th Doctor's
Sonic Screwdriver
Which, honestly, I still think
That the best Sonic Screwdriver was
10th, but that's me
But it's also going to
Have the voices of Matt Smith
Who's currently playing the Doctor
And his lovely Redhead companion
It's going to be pretty cool
I might have to
To get that, I hope it comes out over here
It better
It very well might
You never know
By the way, just
Completely random before we get into the Twitter topic
Since DarkSakura brought up Rockband
I know a friend of mine would be very upset
If I did not mention UmLoud
Is officially announced for this year
This is the Rockband charity night
You play Rockband on stage
You pay money to do it, but it's this whole charity thing
It's pretty awesome
December 9th, the date has officially been announced this year
They switched days, if I'm not mistaken
It's not on the same night of the week
I think last year it was on a Monday
And this year it's going to be on a Thursday
So it's moving up
And apparently one of the big things they're doing this year
There's going to be a headliner band
That they're going to auction away
That's pretty cool
They're just going to sing Lady Gaga
And we'll call ourselves Victoria and the Gays
I'm really excited about that
So you might have to come out and watch us rock it
At UmLoud, but they do an internet stream too
Which I want to say was very well trafficked last year
And you can donate to a good cause
It's all for child's play, etc, etc
I will make sure Se gets on the show to talk about this
At some point
If he doesn't come on I will be sad
Moving on, let's get to some Twitter topics
Some tweets
The Twitters
Twitter.com slash O-L-R
If you want to send us some tweets
Oops, I just closed them
Because I'm a genius
I was on the Twitter page
And my fat finger clicked the button
And I moved to a new page
And now Twitter is giving me the fail whale
That's great
Oh, here we go
Sbhail is asking
Was going to ask what you guys thought about the Sony move
But Rob's Twit pic already answered my question
I didn't post a picture of me holding the
Move controllers in a productive manner
Or anything
Well let me rephrase the question for Loki
Because he already talked about the Sony move earlier in the show
If you could sum up the Sony move in three words
Loki, what would they be?
Just like Nintendo
Nice
Let's see
Tigerclaw is giving us some links tonight
Steam is launching
A beta for the Steam wallet
Payment option
Apparently this is something they're beta testing
Instead of using a debit
Or credit card
You can actually use money out of your card
And put it in a Steam wallet
And then use the money to buy the game
Not sure how this works
Or why this is practical
I'm assuming it's some type of middle thing
Where your parents, when you're good
Will put $25 in your Steam wallet
And then you as the child
Can spend that on whatever
I'm thinking that's what this is
It's kind of like a fancy gift certificate
I guess very soon
It's being beta tested right now
Also from Tigerclaw
Because I'm nice and allowing two tweets tonight
The Xbox Live murderer
Was sentenced to two life sentences
Oh the sad thing is
I look at this and I go
Which Xbox Live murderer?
Because unfortunately there's been a lot of them
Well a jury convicted
Let's see, what's the name of the asshole in this case?
23 year old
Derek Lee Hernandez
Two mandatory life sentences
Congratulations, no parole
He killed 22 year old
Jason Holly
And it was a jury of six men and six women
Who deliberated over two days
Found him guilty
Oh man
I'm not even going to go into the gritty details
About this
Oh this was the guy, he was mentally challenged
And the guy
Kind of took advantage of him
Remember this? This was the judge
He wanted to be your friend Mr. Hernandez
He would have done whatever you asked him
And you took advantage of that
You tricked him into coming up to the mountains
And there was no other reason than to take his life
And yeah it was all this whole like
That he
Took the 360
From the poor guy
It's messed up
But it really has nothing to do with games
Again I hate these senseless murder things
Alright
Moving on, moving on, moving on
Blue Swim
Sending us a tweet
What are your biggest gaming surprises
And disappointments of the current console
Generation? Great job on the marathon show
Loved it
Biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation
From Blue Swim
Anyone?
I would say biggest surprise would be
LittleBigPlanet in a way
I didn't think I'd like that as much as I did
Biggest disappointment
Is probably
The Xbox Live game shows
1 vs 100
Going away so quickly
And without replacement
Anyone?
Uh
Hmm
I don't really
Have any major surprises
Or anything I mean really I mean LittleBigPlanet
I kind of expected it to do big
Um
I guess I'm kind of surprised about Final Fantasy 14
Sucking so bad
So I guess that's a disappointment
Loki anything?
Um
Let's see I would say
Disappointing would be
Nintendo and them grasping
Online because
They really haven't and I know that they have
They have stuff in their store in fact
I think the question is
We should be posing is
When's the last time that we've actually had a
Virtual console release from them?
Oh oh
No disappointment I know the biggest disappointment
PlayStation Home
So much potential just down the toilet
And to bounce off of that
Um
I would have to say probably
Um
Was it Microsoft's wonderful
Arcade thing
Game room Game room yeah
Uh
ActDeft in chat says
The greatest surprise was Earth Defense
Force
Which funny enough leads into Blue Swim's
Other tweets
Loki might recognize where Blue Swim's from in a minute here
And he says also
If I got Loki or OLR in hot water with
D3 publisher for the EDF story on CheapAssGamer
I apologize
Just wanted to share the EDF news and hopefully
Send some new listeners OLR's way in the process
Nah I know you didn't hear anything and you didn't
Send any listeners our way because no one realized
That you know it was from Orange Island
But your blog got a lot of hits
It was CheapAssGamer was the source of that story
Yeah because clearly they talked about it
On their show
No we don't blame you Blue Swim
Oh I know you're just excited
Like Loki is about the game
Remember I did add
A little something though
Remember it's not just 360
This time
Uh let's see
DarkKisuke sends us a tweet saying
You guys should play Dead Space for a show
Maybe the next marathon show
We don't usually play a lot of games on air while we're trying to do the show
It's a little bit distracting
For entertainment
This question might be inappropriate
So ready the inappropriate alarm
DarkSakura could you ready the inappropriate alarm?
Alright
Cause this question's for you for entertainment
Does DarkSakura have a vibrator
To compare the PS3 dildo sticks to?
Dildo sticks too
No
I had to think about it
I had to think about it I don't think anything I have
Her vibrators are uncomparable
No mine aren't USB
Spazinator PSN
Oh this is a good question
I totally forgot about this one
Senses tweet feel like touching on the whole
contemporary banning from Xbox Live
Because some guy lived in Fort Gay
West Virginia
Please tell me you guys heard about this
The guy put in his bio that he lived in Fort Gay
West Virginia
He got banned from Xbox Live
I thought though that they were stopping
They weren't banning people from that stuff nowadays
I think
When it was looked at
Some people thought
That he was calling West Virginia
Gay or something
It's not gay it's Fort Gay
There is
It is a maximum security
Gay facility
Coincidentally is going to be the name of the OLR Fort
That DarkSakura is going to take over someday
Fort Gay
Fort Gay?
Because it means happy
And we'll paint it rainbow
Because everyone loves a rainbow
Especially a double rainbow
What does it mean?
I thought the fortress of sodomy
That's next door
Alright
Obviously they're wearing egg
On their face over the whole thing
It's an excellent
Case of the corporate
Web and how the corporate
Web allowed that thing to spiral
Way out of control because you know
There were rules that were set and this guy
Is saying hey I
Live there, google it
It's a real place
For you and me that's where it should have ended
But unfortunately thanks to corporate
Webs it didn't end there and caused
A nightmare so now Microsoft
Is going to have to look at their
Corporate policy
To make sure this kind of dumb shit doesn't happen
Again
And Tigerclaw is saying
That Microsoft better be careful because
There is actually someone who lives in fucking
Australia
Isn't there a
France or something
I think there is another town called fucking
Fucking Australia
Oh no it's Austria not Australia
That's what I get when I read too fast
Fucking Austria
Sorry Australia
Readest town ever
That's what I say when I realize
Arnold Schwarzenegger really is the governor
Fucking Austria, alright no just kidding
I'm kidding, I'm kidding
AlphaCananagram is sending us a tweet
ChooChooRocket is coming back
That's kind of cool
ChooChooRocket is on its way out on the iPhone
It's going to be out in October
It might be coming to
Xbox Live and Playstation Network
We don't know but it might be
Apparently it needs enough support on
Facebook, it's a big Facebook
Trend thing
Let's see DJ Rama S appeals court
Ruling threatens used
Software sales, uh oh
That can't be good
He sends us a link here to this news
Let's see
A federal appeals court has sided with the computer software
In its effort to squelch sales of second hand programs
Covered by widely used licensing
Agreements
Let's see I'm looking here
A doctrine refers to a 102 year old decision
By the US Supreme Court that determined copyright holders
Can't prevent a buyer from
Reselling or renting a product after an initial
Sale as long as additional copies
Aren't made
A three judge panel in the 9th district
Concluded that first
Sale doctrine didn't apply to used
Software programs that online merchant
Timothy Verner peddled in his
Store on Ebay
Oh this might not be good
I have to read up more on this later
I haven't seen this covered on a lot of sites
Well
We'll see what the legal mumbo jumbo
Is as it comes to this
This is just like the first of many
Things
Alright
And SSJ100Matt on twitter is saying
Comedy site zug.com pulled a real life
Lemmings prank in downtown
Boston oh this has got to be interesting
Is this like a little video or something
Wow they actually dressed up in what looks
Like blue snuggies and green wigs
This is like one of those like stupid flash mob
Things I'm looking at the thing on youtube
Yep so there they go
They're walking into the water and falling in
This is the dumbest thing I've ever
Seen in my life
I love how there's all these college kids in the back
That like don't even care
Some people have too much time on their hands
But I love the look I love the snuggies as outfits
And lastly
Marin Marvel on twitter is saying
I'm totally guest hosting on OLR on October 1st
When Sky is out of town
You should it'll be fun
Actually you shouldn't you should come to Disneyland
With me you know Disneyland is better than this show
Sorry just saying
Just saying
That's it for the tweeters tonight
OLR
Back to gaming news Loki
Ah yes so speaking
Of tweets
This is retarded but
I guess the natural progression of
Stuff
Guitar Hero Warriors
Rock will be the first
Guitar Hero game
I can't see this with any less
Enthusiasm to integrate
Twitter and Facebook
Hurrah
Everybody can know when you do
Stuff in this game
Like I give a shit
But yes
It will be coming is confirmed on the Wii
I can tell you right now
Based off the presentation that was given to me
By the Activision reps
It is also coming to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
Which is not a big surprise
Um
Yes and apparently they've also
Incorporated a Wii award system
So when you do specific challenges in the game
You get credited for an award
And then you can share those online
With your friends
And if you share those online with your friends
They're gonna block you
That's right
Now my steam is working
So
Hurrah
And guess what though at least you know
Well you already know this but I mean if you
Buy guitar hero early you get a CD
Of like
Actual songs that are included in the game
Soundgarden's new album
Interesting tactic
If you like Soundgarden I guess
Yeah I'll be blocking that on Facebook
Pretty quickly no offense
Not really my thing
Hey but there's more details on Rock Band 3
I'm excited about this
No Twitter or Facebook integration here
Actually they are confirming that you will be
Able to export Rock Band 2 tracks
For a fee
The export feature will work on all three
Consoles of course there's always a couple
Of songs that get a little weird
So you can imagine that a couple songs
Are gonna fall off the list unfortunately
But most of them should come over for a small fee
That's really cool
Regular download content will remain the regular
Price that's $2 per song but
They are saying that for Rock Band 3's
Pro mode
The songs will probably be more expensive
Because there's more work that has to be done on
These tracks and they don't want to increase
The cost of regular download content
To subsidize the pro download content
That's aimed at a smaller group of players
Usually I'd be a little worried about this
But I go you know what I feel like
Harmonix kind of does the download content
Better than almost anyone right now so I'm like
Okay I trust them
Like I don't know how you guys feel but I'm just kind of like okay
If that's what they say I trust them
They get it
They've proved that they understand download content for a very long time
This export feature is great
You know yeah it's a fee but
I understand it's out of their hands and it's licensing
At least they bother to do it at all
I kind of go okay they know what they're doing
If that's what they say then I agree
Plus it also makes sense that the Rock Band
Stuff would cost a little more
In the pro mode because there's probably less people
Buying them too you know
Yeah I mean you have to have the pro mode instruments
And stuff like that which are really expensive
Well at least on the guitar
It's really expensive but
You know the keyboard's not so much
I don't know
I wouldn't want to pay extra for that stuff
But if you really want to
There's a market for it
I'm interested in the pro mode stuff
Especially for keyboards
Because once you learn how to like play the song
On a keyboard you could actually go to like a piano
Or whatever and play it I think that's awesome
If you can memorize it so
I'm looking forward to trying that out
That's going to be very cool
So we're going to go over to Dark Sakura
Who's got another story for us here
I sure do
Coming up very soon the mailbag
From Marvel versus Capcom the FUs of the week
And your calls
Well we've got a new challenger in
For Marvel versus Capcom 3
And this is
Pretty pretty sweet
But we're getting Tron Bonn
That's so cool
She's kind of on crack
She's kind of been in like
A lot of the fighting games right
Give us the new Mega Man Legends already
I hate you
Servbots have been in the background
In Capcom, they're so cute
They look like Lego Men
Yeah I agree though, where's Mega Man Legends
There is coming but it's
It's just going to take forever
I would buy that on PS1 Classics if I could
Is that available? I don't think it is
For PS1 Classics
Damn you Capcom
Just when you're doing so many things right
There's that one thing
One thing
You know with
Let's say that the
Homebrew scene or pirating scene
However you want to call it
Gets to where it is on the PSP
They have ways to convert
PS1 ISO files into
A playable format on the
PlayStation emulator that's on the
PSP so you can port
Mega Man Legends or something like that
If they can do it for the PSP
They may be able to do it for the PS3
Very nice
Or I could just find the PS1 disc somewhere and play it
My PS3
Is that hard to find?
No they're not
I don't remember the game being particularly rare
I could be wrong but
Yeah
Anyhow speaking of Mega Man Loki right?
Yes speaking of Mega Man
There's some new details coming out
About Mega Man Universe
And it's kind of cool
The game itself looks a little bit like
It could be similar to the Mega Man
Powered up Mega Man
Which was on the PSP
It showed a level editor
That's awesome
That you'll be able to share of course
With your friends
Different levels that you've made
It's Little Big Mega Man
Isn't that what this game is turning into?
It seriously is getting pretty awesome
And they had some other screenshots
That showed
Different playable characters
They had a screenshot that actually showed
The box art Mega Man plane
Also you can create
New Mega Man characters by
Mixing and matching different parts
Like different heads and what not
Really cool stuff and also I guess
They're saying that
Of course there's going to be the
Ryu Mega Man that's in there
Probably the ghosts and goblins Mega Man
Mega Men
Mega Men yes
In fact here's the screenshot there of
The box art one which
Is so ugly
Well you know this isn't the first time that Mega Man's had
Street Fighter moves
Because remember in X2
He could get the Hadoken and Shoryuken
If you did the special
Level thing
Which I could do
But the game itself though
I'm kind of rusty when it comes to
Identifying my Mega Man stages
But I'm wondering if it's going to have
More than just
It looks like Mega Man
2 characters
It looks very Mega Man 2 inspired
Doesn't it? I'm wondering if it's going to have more than that
That might be cool. Alpha Cananagram
In the chat is quick to correct me on things
He says Mega Man powered up with
The level editor came out 2 years before
Little Big Planet
True enough I suppose but I don't know
I kind of feel like Little Big Planet's
Really made the splash you know what I mean I don't know
Yeah
But ok sure so this idea is
Not entirely new for the Mega Man series
Well I know I'm interested in the game
I'm going to buy it. Is it arcade or is it retail?
Have they said? Arcade
Oh man that's going to be a heck of an arcade game
Hopefully it's not more than
20 bucks but watch them be charging like 30
If there's going to be a game that's going to break the price barrier
Yet again it'll be this. Watch
We'll see though
Hopefully not
If they do try to break the barrier
It might leave Valve to talk even more smack
About Xbox Live. Oh you haven't heard
Valve has apparently talked some smack
About Xbox Live
This is kind of interesting because I seem to recall
Some time ago it was just the reverse
They used to dog on Playstation 3
And they were supporting Xbox Live
With exclusives such as Portal still alive
Well times have changed a little bit
Haven't they?
Gabe Newell has referred to Xbox Live as a
Train Wreck
Quote, we thought that there would be something that would emerge
Because we figured it was sort of untenable
Oh yeah we understand that these are the rules now
But it's such a train wreck that something
Will have to change
That's why we're really happy with the current situation with the Playstation 3
We're solving it now in a way that is going to work
For our customers rather than assuming
Something is going to emerge later
That will allow us to fix this
Yikes
They're saying that Microsoft has got to change the
Online policies if they want to compete
You know I want to say though not the first person
To dog a little bit on Xbox Live
This kind of reminds me of Square Enix
Coming out a little bit ago saying that
Final Fantasy 14 is not coming out on the
Xbox 360 because Xbox Live
Just ain't going to work
That's what they're saying
Very interesting
Yeah
It's interesting to me
Kind of how Valve has come full circle
I mean and I can see the reasons
Why to an extent
And certainly again not the first developer
To say bad things about
Xbox Live but it's just very interesting
How much things have changed in a few years
There you go
Let's get to the mail bag
Shall we? Dark Soccer you ready to rip open the email
Bag and read some emails for us here?
I'm ready to rip something
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
If you want to send us any emails to be read on the
Air. Did we get some emails? The mailbag was pretty
Thin going into tonight's show. Did we get some?
We got a few
The first one's from awesomedude slash troy
Now this is the philosophical question I gave us some
Warning
Even though my emails might be getting monotonous
From the consistency of pointless ones
This question actually has meaning
Now I have had this brewing
In my head for a couple of days
And I'm afraid I might not be able to do it
Either before well I leave this
Dying ball of life we call Earth
Yeah I just tried to make that sound cool
If you had to choose changing
The world and leaving your mark on it or
Living your life with a loved one which one would you choose?
You know what I would choose?
I don't see why you can't do both
Jeez
I know it's tricky because what's going to
Prevent me from doing one over the other it's
Strange um
What if by being with somebody you leave your mark
On the world? I kind of feel like
Okay this is going to sound really cheesy but I feel
Like in a way this show has left the mark
On the world a little bit
Like maybe not in a totally like
Amazing humanitarian
Mother Teresa kind of way
But just some of the really nice
Emails that I've got over the years
Especially from like you know other
Guys who sometimes struggle
With oops not the FU music yet
Um sometimes other guys who've like struggled
With coming out and stuff and saying that like
Hearing me on the show has helped with that like the power
Of an email like that is like
Really hard to put into words
And just like in how that makes you feel
Like you've really had an impact and I know
You know there's there's quote unquote fans
Of all of us out there which is such a strange
Feeling because we're pretty normal
People we just like video games and
Figured out how to do this radio thing pretty
Quickly and have stayed pretty dedicated to it
Um that those kind of words have been amazing
So I kind of feel like in some ways
I've already picked the first option
Because I'm not living with a loved
One right now the dark soccer is
Doing both yeah so
It's tough because you're asking me to backtrack
I don't know I don't see
Why you can't do both I mean what's the
They're not mutually exclusive
Plus if you live with a loved
One aren't you leaving your mark
On the world
With that relationship I know that sounds
So weird but a little bit my philosophy
Is that the best way to change the world
And leave your mark is to be an active
Part of making it better
To
Not be a dick to people
You know
To
You know if you've got the extra time
And you're just sitting on your butt
You know go volunteer or something
There's nothing to say that you can't do
Both just love people
And it doesn't mean I don't mean like sex
I don't mean like love like kissy
Kissy I just mean like there's all different types
Of love there's platonic love there's
Family love brotherly love
You know there is romantic love there's
Love for earth I don't mean
To sound like a hippie or whatever but
I think that's kind of what a lot of it's about
Isn't it? You've nailed it on the head
Just
Don't love people
People get all butt hurt over their own political
You know points of view being
Hey everyone's gotta believe what I do
Man
But you know if everyone was exactly the same
It would be boring
And we would stagnate
It's those differences that put a challenge
We would be the Borg
I am a firm believer that people don't
Grow without a challenge
That you have to have that challenge for people to overcome
And if they don't overcome those are the people who don't
Get to do anything in the world
You know they're just gonna
I have a hard time putting this
Because some people are content to live their life
Just being themselves
You know not doing anything
But I think that the best
Way to grow and challenge
Yourself is to
Move outside your comfort zone
To do something that's gonna make it better
Because nothing changes until you make a change
Well
That has nothing to do with games
That was a very deep email for this program
But hey sorry to dodge your question
But hope you got out of it
Loki didn't say anything
Eh
There I said something
Oh Loki
Next email
Hi OLR crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act
I wanted to tell you that you did a pretty damn
Good job with the marathon on Sunday
Slash Monday I wish I could have been
There while this was live but I
Did catch the podcast
Is this
You about many interesting topics
Like favorite game and soundtracks
I guess it's you spoke about many interesting
Topics like favorite game and soundtracks
And other stuff since I wasn't there to participate in
The chat room I would like to participate to
That with this email
My favorite game and probably my favorite
Soundtrack of all time is Kirby Superstar
So many different games to choose
From and they're pretty detailed with puzzles
And pretty good platforming
Actdeft likes Kirby you don't say
I didn't know I hadn't heard
Hey No it's funny that's cool
And the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing
And probably since then
It has made me so interested in video music
Like I am now
Video game music sorry
I would really recommend people getting
Kirby Superstar Ultra on the DS
Make it worthy
Make it worthy of any DS game library
But not as all
Happy game wise
Excuse me
You also talked about disappointment
Mine was Final Fantasy 8
Got it for cheap but I still think I got robbed
Hey let me finish
Well I don't like Final Fantasy 7 either
At least in
At least decent in lots of things
Final Fantasy 8 really takes all the good things
Of the series and burns them to the ground
The card game is damn awful
I never played the card game for the record
And it doesn't give you a real good incentive
To play it kind of like Blitzball and Final Fantasy 10
Which I didn't really do either
But the thing I hate the most
About the whole damn game is the story
It sucks bad it's terra bad
I don't even like Final Fantasy 10
Pretty much for the same things
But I didn't buy it and even though the battle system
And grid system is kind of cool
Final Fantasy 8 really I don't give a crap about that game
See he doesn't like it for the wrong reasons
Cause I think the story was actually
It's strongest part it's the battles
That really did it in for me
But from what I play to the beta
14 very well might be worse than 8
Like I don't know yet
I guess I will have to play the retail version
At some point to give you my final thoughts
But there may be a new challenger
For the worst Final Fantasy game ever
Oh no the new challenger has appeared
I'll let you know
Oh well that's all for now I will talk about other stuff
You talked about next week
I don't want to send a big ass email
Too late no I'm kidding
Until next time
P.S. I still don't believe that Duke Nukem Forever will get released
We'll see
And I wonder if this one
I think it will now that it's with the new developer
I think that's what had to happen
It just needed to be taken by somebody else
It'll come out now
Next email
When you guys were young did you ever play a game
That was so horrible but there was something about it
That always kept you playing
One bad game that comes to mind is Banjo-Kazooie
I spent countless hours sitting in front of my parents TV screen
Trying to collect all those little
Glowing puzzle pieces
I wanted to punch the TV screen every time the crazy
Bear and bird spoke
However for some unknown reason I kept playing till I beat it
Today I cringe when I hear any song from that game
What about you guys?
Your fellow girl gamer Ziba
Clash at Demonhead
Totally
It's not that great a game really
It's definitely a guilty pleasure game
I used to love that game and I don't know why
As far as old school 8-bit NES games go
I really can't remember any
There's games that pissed me off that I'd keep playing
Like Puzzle and Desu
I'm sorry, you remember I covered that on Classic Game?
That game pisses me off so much
And it's really not even the best game ever
But the challenge is so hard to it
Ugh, that game pisses me off
What about you, Loki?
Earth Defense Force
It gets really challenging
Especially when you get on those inferno levels
Sometimes it makes me want to hurt somebody
And I just play more of it
Good call
Last email
No!
Hey, OLR, emailing in on a few things
That I wouldn't recommend
But I know I would forget, so here it goes
I know this news is two weeks late
But Sony not only has their dreaded online pass
On some sports games
But it's on an awesome PSP FPS
Called SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3
Also, this may be old news
But I've never heard this on the radio
Any radio which makes me laugh
Any of you heard of a game
Called Minecraft?
I've never heard of it
I've never heard of it
Any of you heard of a game called Minecraft?
Don't judge on graphics
Although you guys probably wouldn't
My way of describing it would be
Awesomesauce imagination orgasm
Okay
You have unlimited boundaries
North, south, east, and west
And you can go really far up and down
And it's only in alpha
Give it a try and decide whether or not to buy it
It's only 10 euros or about 13 bucks
And it entitles you to play future releases of the game
And he put the address
C-R-A-F-T dot net
Is he a co-producer or writer?
I don't know. I don't think so
Currently it has only one developer
But he's awesome
Here's the bullshit part
He's been making so much money from people paying for it
PayPal fucking froze his account
Due to a suspicious withdrawal or deposit
That's pretty funny
Um
I'm actually gonna look at this real quick
Cause I wouldn't
Hitstun in our chatroom says there's a lot of Minecraft
On Justin TV
It doesn't look that bad
It looks really, um
Super Nintendo-ish 3D
But yeah
Apparently he
It was over 600,000 euros
And then
PayPal is like trying to keep the money or something
That's weird
That's kinda screwed up
Anyway, gonna continue
Minecraft may seem odd
But it's great and freaking addictive
When you realize all the possible things you can do
Slash make
Um, well, I think that's enough for one email
But I'll chat slash call in if I have anything else of interest
That comes up
May the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless your souls
DarkCuseK AKA Butcher
Raw man
P.S. Gonna be super sad to not hear your voices next week
I guess he's not gonna be listening next week
Oh, oh
I forgot
He sent us a tweet that said disregard is P.S.
Oopsie
Whoops
Screwed up on that one
I think he might have us mixed up with Bobby Black Wolf
Cause Bobby's not live next week
Oh, YouTube
Alan sent me this YouTube
And if Alan sent it to me I have to look at it
He told me a little bit about what it is
And I'd heard of this
And it sounds kinda cool
Oh, it's like, uh, stop motion
All these people in colored shirts
Sitting in chairs
Doing Pac-Man
They do these in a movie theater
That's kind of rad
Can Alan link that in chat?
Please? Thank you
I like the little noise in the background
Let me turn that up a little bit
Doo doo doo doo doo
I love the noises more than anything
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Okay, anyway, this makes for terrible radio
People did a Space Invaders one
That takes a lot of work
Like, that took all day
God
College kids
Y'all had too much free time
It's a lot of its editing though
Because all they had to do was get one scene
Where everybody was sitting in the grid
In the beginning
And then just take one shot of that and keep superimposing
Where he's at
It does take a lot of effort
But it's not as much as
They used magic and witchcraft
Or they took one shot
Where he wasn't in each spot and just kept playing
Stop motion
They had to hold that camera
Real steady
Real steady
Hey, it's that time of the show where we get mad
The FUs of the Week
Um
My FU of the Week goes to, uh, Dan not being here
Well, I mean
And I understand it was important to go to see his family
But still
It doesn't really stop me from being very lonely
Because he's been
You know, while he's not working and I wasn't working
I was used to having him here all day
And it was really nice
And now he's not there
And also I have to go back into the office tomorrow
Because bitches didn't send me my, um
My letter about getting laid off
And I haven't been paid in two weeks
So you know what this means
If they don't fix it
I can collect interest
On my pay
And if they don't get anything to me
I'm going to the labor board
Alert the media
Well, I could talk to the media too
I don't know how far I want to get into this
But I was looking at work at the news
And the latest things
I saw your work on the
Local news media site
About the closure
And see, I never got any memo that says
Don't talk about it
I'm not under NDA
Oh
Uh, Loki
I had some that I was
Really pissed off about earlier
And I don't remember what it was
I'm going to go with my second
Thing that I'm pissed off at
And that would be Apple
And I'm pissed off at their customer service
It's good and terrible at the same time
The reps are nice
The just simple
Logic stuff just doesn't seem to
Apply to them. For example
I purchased two iPod Touches
From them using an Apple gift card
That I got from Sony
From my work for some sort of sales
Incentive thing
I purchased it on the third
And they
According to the site
When I ordered it, it said it was going to be shipped
This week
Instead this week, they changed it
And it's shipping next week
And you know
Meanwhile, the Apple store has tons of these
They have just a pile of them
Just sitting there
So I called them up multiple times going
I need to cancel my order
So that I can go purchase
Oh I'm sorry, even though we took off
The funds immediately out of your card
It's going to take us five to seven business days
To put it back on the card
Even though it's their own Apple card
I'm like, well okay fine, I don't really want to cancel
I just want to pick it up at the local store
Because they have them in stock
Oh no, I'm sorry you can't do that
Because our systems are separate
So that's retarded
It finally shipped though on Friday
FROM CANADA
Why the fuck are you shipping something
From Canada to the United States
I'm sure you have a fucking plant
In the US that you can ship these from
But no, let's pick a really far away
Place to ship it from
Just to piss me off even more
I wouldn't have these, that fucking gift card
I wouldn't be buying your stupid iPods
But I am
Like I'm fucking going to buy an ITV
Or an iMac, no way
We're part of Canada
I don't know
I'm not familiar with Canada
I can look that up real quick while you do your FUs
I will, my FU
Goes to myself
Because I've managed to put a scratch on my brand new car
After having it for only about
Two and a half months
I'm going to park
Don't worry, I didn't hit another car
Refrain from making fun of me
Because I will destroy you
I scratched the car parking in Alan's garage
Because
It's big city garages
And they're very tight fits
In the big cities
As opposed to what I'm used to dealing with in Sacramento
Where it's like giant four car garages
Yeah, I got a big old scratch in the car now
And I'm kind of upset about it
My mistake, it's not Canada
Even further away
Because there's no Shanghai, Canada
It's China
They're shipping it from China
Yeah, let's pick the furthest place
From my location to ship this from
That's probably where the damn thing's made
I like that, that's awesome
And by the way, because Apple's so wonderful
And you know, in saving their costs
They ship them separate
The two items are actually separate
Thank you
Thank you for doing all that wonderful stuff for me
Why are you mad though?
Hey, more news, happy happy
And then the Skype line's coming at you
1877 Game OLR, not just yet
I'll let you know when
Yes, um
So there's a brand new
Overclock remix album
That's coming out, you may remember the last one
Was a remix album from Final Fantasy 7
This time it's going to be
A five part Final Fantasy 5 compilation
Oh I get it
Five parts, because it's five
Ha
It's called the Final Fantasy 5
The Fabled Warriors
An overclocked remix five part album series
And um
It is free
Which is the best price
And the first part of the five
Is actually out now
So you can go check it out
And if you want to download that
Go to
wcremix.org
Alright
One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the
Skype line at 877 Game OLR
Our username on Skype
OrangeLoungeRadio
Being asked in chat from floppy discourse
What about Google Talk? Doesn't Google Talk let you call
877 numbers now?
Like you can call numbers in the US and Canada?
You can actually call numbers?
That's what I heard, yeah
I'll keep my phone with Google
Talk once I get
I was going to get a prepaid phone
Through like AT&T or something
Like that
But I don't like AT&T
Because they're like, oh by the way there's all these fees
We add on top of that
Because I only would use like 12 minutes a month
And I'd use their 25 cent
Per minute plan or something like that
But then they're like, oh we're going to add another dollar fee
On there, oh and there's taxes, oh and there's this
Oh and there's a convenience fee
So I'll just go through Virgin
Alright, one more story
For you guys, do you know the name
Chiaki Kuriyama?
I hope you do
Yeah I know the name
She was in Kill Bill
And she was in Battle Royale
Correct
She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill
And then she was
I don't remember the character's name
She was in Battle Royale
She was in both of those movies
She was
Not cock puncher
She will soon be taking the role of
Misuzu Asaki
It's going to be the heroine of the new
Yakuza game
That's right, it's Yakuza Ryugagotoku of the End
That's right, Sega revealed this week
To IGN the fact that she is in the game
There's going to be some images
Compared here where you can actually
See that the character in the game
Looks like her too, which is kind of freaky
She's a very pretty girl
And the character looks like her
Characters in other movies, very reminiscent
Of Gogo Yubari
So there it is, very cool
There's some other characters in the game as well
But no worry about who the voice actors are
There will be lots and lots and lots of more
Information at the Tokyo Game Show
This actress does not
Really act or speak in English
As far as I know
She doesn't play Japanese exclusive roles
So don't expect this voice acting to come over to the US
But for those of you guys that are really into
The Yakuza series, like I know
Deakman, who does our website, loves these games
Probably will import it on Playstation 3
Thanks to the region free stuff
Can look forward to hearing her lovely voice
As the heroine in that game
Very cool
Skypline is now open 1877 Game OLR
Or our username on Skype
Is OrangeLoungeRadio
We're already getting calls, you ready for this?
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
Who's this?
Hey, this is DJ Blaziken
DJ Blaziken, what's on your mind?
Not much
Other than I got a little bit
Of a similar situation
That Loki kind of discussed
A while back
On an episode how he's
Trying to stray away from the three-fret
Formation
Because he was a converger
From guitar freaks to guitar hero
Well, let's just say here
I had the same excuse
When I started playing guitar hero
I'm like
I cannot play medium, there's four notes
There should only be three
Aw, it wasn't that hard
It wasn't that hard
All it takes is
Loki, one word
Practice
That's right, practice
Yeah, but that also takes time
And time I'm not willing to spend on that
Okay
I will say though, I recently
Downloaded and played the
DJ Hero 2 demo
Oh, I forgot that's out
I did half that
You know what, those bastards didn't put it on PlayStation Network
And my controller and gamer
For PlayStation Network
It's exclusive to Xbox 360
Because we're Activision
And we suck
Well, okay
I will say though, it is pretty cool
On the factor
Now they have the DJ battle mode
Which is basically
Okay, if you remember just
Normal space off in Guitar Hero
It's basically what this is for DJ Hero
It's cool it is
So, like, you do one part
And then your player does another part
And he goes back and forth
I'm still wondering though if they're gonna do
And I forgot to ask him when he was there
If they're gonna do the guitar here
Or the guitar DJ stuff again
I remember how they had that
By what I was seeing on the demo
There wasn't anything for guitar and DJ
It was mostly the vocals
And DJ stuff
And my father kind of found
It kind of weird that I was singing
The song, Don'tcha
The Doncha remix
And then the Lady Gaga remix
It would have been cool though
If they did that because they could have had vocals
And they could have had guitars
And then a DJ or something
Man, that would be great
For Loki to get that on YouTube
Doing a Doncha
You know what they really should have done
But I'm sure they don't want to affect their
DJ Hero sales
You know how Rock Band 3
Added keyboards have the next
Guitar Hero game add turntables
To the actual rock stuff
How many songs really support that though?
Not many, but it would be kind of neat though
As in a little added download content
How many songs support a guitar in DJ Hero?
Not a lot, but it was pretty cool
The ones that did
And actually, do you know what
Of all the weird things
You know how you guys were talking about
Learning the actual dance moves
From Dance Central and whatnot
Well, of all the weird things
One of my
One of my friends
Went to a Macy's store and actually
Went and tried out
A thing with Dance Central
And he showed me some of the moves
To Lady Gaga's Poker Face
And let's just say
Here
I think it was that or Just Dance that came on
At Homecoming
And we were actually pulling off
The actual dance moves from the music video
And
Let's just say here, we were
Getting questions asked, like
How do you know the moves from the video?
And you both got laid, right?
Huh?
Nothing
Basically, our answer was
We learned them from a video game
And people just gave us a weird eye
And it was the same thing
It was the same thing we were doing
Next time you need to say
Private lessons
Private lessons is your answer next time
You know, it's not
I mean, cause see a game like
Even Just Dance, actually
It's not, you know
It shows you dance moves
I would go repeating
What was in there. Okay, let me play this way, Rob
And this is just gonna make you want YouTube videos
Of this even more
I had, I picked some songs
To play, you know, like I did
Junior Seniors
Move Your Feet, that was fun
Um
Wait, in Dance Central? No, not Dance Central
In Just Dance 2
I know that song
From DDR Extreme back on the Playstation 2
Which, that was the last
Good one
That was one of our first songs retired from the
Cage match because the video was so awesome
It is awesome
Um, there's a song on there, I don't remember which
Artist it is, but they have like a Tron guy
Dancing in the background of
Just Dance 2, but anyways
As I was gonna say, I got to pick some songs
And then the Ubisoft ref, she got to pick
Some songs, and unfortunately she picked
It's Raining Men
So there is a video out there of me
Trying to beat her
At, you know, I was
Trying to be more fabulous than she was
I guess, at that
But I got close, I did not beat
Her though at that song, and thank god
Because that would have been the only song that I actually beat her in
And that would not be good either
Sorry, I just need to hear a little bit of this song here
This song is pretty amazing
Too bad this band never really went anywhere
But this song
Hey, um, by the way
Uh, on the factor, okay
I figured out a way to sort of
Try to play Guitar Hero Rock Band
And, um, what else
Rock Revolution
To make the guitar point like guitar freaks
In other words, all I've had to do
Is flip my miniature
Monitor like it's a 9 incher monitor
Upside down
Flip it to lefty mode
And
That's how I've been able to make it play like guitar freaks almost
That is a lot of effort
For such a little reward
But hey, whatever makes you happy, dude
Alright
We gotta let you go to get some more calls, dude
I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off
Because we gotta get some more calls
But thank you so much
Hurry it up
We actually did some DDR moves
To, I think it was, um
My Sharona
Let's just say here, one or two
Guys who said they might have heard your show
Back in the day
We should have been on Step Squad years ago
Since you've been at DDR tournaments
We've been watching a bunch of Mel B dance
Videos from tournaments
Ah, alright
Well, next time take an orange bat
To prom, that's all I'm saying
If you really want to represent the show
Later
1-877-GAME-OL-R
If you wanna give us a call
Or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype
If you wanna give us a call that way, like this person is
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
Hey, it's Ronma, what's up everyone
Hey, Ronma, what's up?
Not much, um
To answer what you said about the Texas Instrument calculators
Yeah, they're still making them
And multiple models and flavors
I just would have thought that, like
They were on, like, model, like
90-100 by now, you know what I mean?
Like, instead of 82
Well, my roommate has a TI-85
But they don't make that one anymore
From what I remember
This is from, like, a few months ago
They still make the 83, the 84
84 Plus
84 Plus Silver, the 89
And one called the Nspire
One size a scientific calculator
You pull the keyboard out and you flip it over
It's like a mini computer
That sounds like a sidekick or something, that's crazy
And yeah, that thing's like
200 bucks, and around this time
In the year, the parents come in
With the, um, with the list of
Stuff that the kids need, and if they're taking
Entry-level algebra math
They're told that they need a
TI calculator
Now, who remembers the TI-99-4A?
Anyone remember that?
I had that
That was a computer in the 1980s, the TI-99
I had that
With the big cartridge thing on the side
Oh yeah, the big ol' cartridge slot that went on the side
I have played so many games on that
There's something that I need to find
You want to get a TI-99
Just for the heck of it?
Just so you can play, like, Texas Invaders
Wow
Would that be Mexicans?
No, it's a
Space Invaders rip-off
You dingbat
Alright, I'm sorry, that'd be Arizona Invaders
Stop it
Alright
Well, thank you for the
Update on calculators
Glory to tell
Alright, make it quick
I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
A couple of weeks ago
And I was checking my scores on the leaderboards
And I'm going to post a link in the chatroom
Of a Twitpig, because this makes for great radio
Now, the funny thing is
If you look at it, I'm ranked
Above someone called
I'm a greedy Jew
And I found it
Slightly offensive
So someone's game tag is I'm a greedy Jew
Just to be fair, though, you're two slots
Above I'm a greedy Jew, actually
Two slots, yeah
You're under
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you're five slots
Under Yapathy
I just find it
Funny that when I first got Rock Band
I went and I created my band
Which was my roommate's idea, which was called
Rhythm in Jews
When I put it in, it said
And I quote
Jews are banned on Xbox Live
I think that was
A programming issue
I had to go and change the
E to a 3
Way so I can get on and play
Well
Did you report the name for being offensive?
Because I'm thinking, you know, call
Me crazy, but if Mount
Gay or whatever, no, Fort Gay
West Virginia is going to get banned
I have a feeling I'm a greedy
Jew might be
Slightly offensive, and I don't think that's
A town in, like, South Carolina or
Anything, I'm pretty sure that guy's just
A douchebag
And I've seen a couple more names like that, so I popped
In Rock Band 2, flipped the
3 back to an E, and I had
No problem going on live
Whatever makes you happy
I'm just amused by it, that's all
It just amuses
Me, that's all it is
Alright, well I have to
Now that we have one sitting in studio
I have to ask the official Jew of Orange Lawn
Radio Dark Sakura, are you offended by the
Name I'm a Greedy Jew
On Xbox Live?
I don't really
Get offended, I think, by other people, really
Because they're the ones who are stupid and
Ignorant, and I'm not
However, he could very likely
Just admit all the, you know
Perhaps he
Admits that he's Jewish
And happens to be a bit greedy
That could be
Maybe it's really SSJ-100 Matt
However
You called him into the show just to make that
Joke, didn't you?
Kinda, sorta
However
I mean
I just have a hard time
About being offended by other people's
Ignorance
They're just, they're poop
They're being poopy
Why is that person worth my time?
You know
I think
It's a symptom
Of society
And it's not, I don't think
It's funny
I don't think it's funny at all
And I'm sure it is intended to be
Offensive
But I would rather just not give them
The satisfaction of being offended
That's me
Alright
Well, Rama, any other offensive things you wanna
Bring to the attention of our little program?
Baba Booey, Baba Booey
Howard Stern
Bye, Rama

Or our username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio if you care to venture that way
We're taking your calls
Live as we tape our show on this
Lovely Sunday evening
Hot and ready to go
What? No
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
Clearly, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
Who's this?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Yes we can, hi
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill
DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?
Not that much
Two things, just real quick
That shows that hell is freezing over
First, I'm actually getting Halo Reach
Oh my gosh, Halo Reach around
For it?
Somewhat, only because it's the last game
In the series apparently
And I'm getting a $20 gift card from Best Buy
So why not?
Nice
Yeah, just pretty much all the reasons
I mean, I gotta multiplayer and end up cursing everybody out
As usual
But that's just the first sign
And the second sign which is very
I'm gonna ask everybody here for help is
I'm also getting a Playstation 3
By Christmas this year
And the thing is
The only really big condition is
I need to get more games that are not
That everybody can play
Not just myself
Like party games
You could say that
Games are not like
What about the Playstation move?
I mean, it's just gonna be a bunch of wee party
games on the move, any interest in that?
Well, actually that
Is the reason I'm getting it, first off
For the move
There you go right there
Yeah
I was just thinking
I was just thinking more games
Than just the move games
You know, something else
The SingStar franchise is always a good
Party starter, that's really popular at parties
Because it's like karaoke, one of the
Karaoke games, it's a little different from
Rock Band in those games because A, it's exclusively
Singing and lets you do duets and stuff
And B, it actually shows the actual music videos
In the background, which I think is kind of a nice
Touch, especially for people that aren't as familiar
With video games, it's like, suddenly you have a
Karaoke bar in your house, so that's all
Interesting, you know, in that regard, those are
Always fun games, what else?
Fun party games on the
Playstation 3 or multiplayer
Events, Little Big Planet
Absolutely, is a Playstation 3
Exclusive, up to four people can play that game
At once, online or in the same house
Modulation Racers, oh that's a good one too
That's a good one for multiplayer, can you
Do, does it have split screens, you can do that all?
I believe it does
Nice, very nice
What are the fun little party games?
Blur, I don't know
I'm trying to think of things that are exclusive
Because you said you had a 360, right?
There is Buzz
Oh, Buzz is
Very popular for parties, that's the game
Showy game, when it comes to the special
Controllers that are just like the A, B, C and D
Answers, and people who write their own
Questions and everything, that is a big
Big party game, for multiplayer
You can write in your own questions?
Yes you can, that's what I hear
Yeah, I know right
Apparently they, I don't
Know if you can straight up
Do your, I don't have the game personally, I don't know
If you can straight up do your own questions and play
A game locally with those questions you wrote
But I know like people are able to submit
Questions to like official question packs
And things, I've heard of this, I don't
Know, again I don't own the game myself
So I'm not sure of all the details and how it works
All my own questions? That'd be great
Like an OLR trivia pack
Would anyone play that? I don't know
Alright, so I guess those are our
Suggestions, so let us know what you end
Up buying and if you have fun with it
I definitely will guys
Alright, well have fun with PlayStation 3
Keep on gaming
And we'll talk to you later, okay?
Alright, be good guys
Later, we'll try
That's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
Sorry for those guys that didn't get through, but be sure to
Always leave us an email
OrangeLoungeRadio.com or
Our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR
And so forth
Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to tonight?
It's not a lot tonight
One is that there's a rumor
That the Nintendo DS, or not the DS
The 3DS will be out
In Japan in November
This is coming from a company called
Keys Factory
Yeah, Keys Factory, they design
A bunch of DS,
DSi, DSi, XL
Peripherals
And apparently this is coming from
Their Twitter
And it was saying that
Let's see here
It was saying November 20th is when they're expecting
The system out
So
That's interesting, it says on November 20th
11 3DS
Products that we designed to go on sale
All at once, people who are buying 3DS
Buy it at the same time
There'll be more details on our homepage
So
It's interesting, maybe they'll announce that
At Tokyo Game Show, since it's right around the corner
Actually no, I don't think
They actually are at Tokyo Game Show
Well, maybe around the same time
They usually do their own Nintendo thing
So that's that
And then Knights in the Nightmare
A game that was originally out on the Nintendo DS
From Atlus
It's coming to the PSP
And kind of as an added bonus
They are going to be giving you
A copy, a digital copy that is
Of, and I cannot
Pronounce this, but we're going to try
Looks like
Yggdras
Union, I guess
Y-G-G-D-R-A
And
That's going to be in every
Copy, every launch copy of
Knights in the Nightmare, but knowing
Atlus, that will be all the copies of
Knights in the Nightmare on PSP
They're scheduled to come out
November 9th
So that's kind of cool
And
That'd be it
Wow, this is kind of slow on the last minute
Yeah, it's pretty, pretty dead
Alright
Well, that's going to do it for this week's episode
Of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we get around
And get everybody's final thought
Uh, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?
Suebooks!
Can we please make that the fortune cookie message tonight?
I don't know what you had picked, but
Okay, okay, okay
Alright, thank you
Let me pick one once in a while
I had Lewis Black, so
We'll roll him over to next week, you won't mind
Alright
Loki, your final thought tonight?
I don't catch that reference
You will soon
Is that it for your final
I don't get it
Hopefully I'll have a connect in
Two weeks
Alright
Cross my fingers
My final thought is
I don't know
Hi, that's my final thought
I don't know
Bye, that's my final thought
Bye, have a great week everybody
