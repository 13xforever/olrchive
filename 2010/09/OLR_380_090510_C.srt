1
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:09,013
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:14,578
[SPEAKER_28]: We are live on September the 5th of 2010, a Sunday here with our Orange Lounge Radio Marathon.

3
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,201
[SPEAKER_28]: We are almost, what, about seven hours in at this point now?

4
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:24,266
[SPEAKER_28]: We started at about 2.05, and it's now 8.50 on the West Coast here where we tape.

5
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:32,733
[SPEAKER_28]: You can listen live, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and I imagine that's what most of you are doing, because the podcast, you'd have to be way, way, way into that now to get to this point.

6
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:33,393
[SPEAKER_28]: So...

7
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:39,917
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyhow, we were going to do some news here, and I was going to open the Skype line again here in just a moment, so we'll have that again open.

8
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:42,818
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

9
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:43,779
[SPEAKER_28]: Not just yet.

10
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:44,900
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to open it here in a moment.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:56,225
[SPEAKER_28]: But we had another question, I guess, come in on Ask Orange Lounge or something that slipped through the cracks, and I thought it was a pretty good question, so I apologize to bother Alan mid-chew there, but do you remember what that question was all about?

12
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:57,326
[SPEAKER_28]: The extra question we got?

13
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:02,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Which game or system did you pass up on when it came out that you never bought that you now regret?

14
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:07,144
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought there was also a question, what system do you regret buying, too?

15
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:09,625
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, well, let's do both.

16
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:17,348
[SPEAKER_28]: What system do you regret buying, and what thing do you wish you hadn't passed up, I guess that would be?

17
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:19,049
[SPEAKER_28]: Um...

18
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,888
[SPEAKER_28]: Saga Dreamcast Saga Dreamcast Saga Dreamcast

19
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,505
[SPEAKER_28]: So that would probably be my answer.

20
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,185
[SPEAKER_28]: I did get one when they were like $40.

21
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:48,906
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember when they cut the price down to like $40?

22
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:52,267
[SPEAKER_28]: Or at least GameStop was just trying to unload them or something.

23
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:56,408
[SPEAKER_28]: Because at that point you could do all the NES emulators on the Dreamcast and all that stuff.

24
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:57,789
[SPEAKER_28]: It was really cool.

25
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,470
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's when I finally got on the Dreamcast bandwagon.

26
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,950
[SPEAKER_28]: But it was a little bit too late.

27
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,531
[SPEAKER_28]: And keep in mind, guys, the Skype line is not open yet.

28
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:06,872
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you're calling in, hold off.

29
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,992
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll get to the calls a little later here in the program.

30
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:09,953
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan?

31
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:23,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually was able to buy an original edition of Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Saturn, which came out well after the Saturn was dead.

32
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:31,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought it, took the bus after school to go to the mall, dropped the 70 or 80 bucks for it.

33
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:59,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I ended up selling it for a killing on eBay like two years later I never touched it so I bought it never played it and Panzer Dragoon Saga is one of the greatest RPGs especially for the Saturn and I sold it on eBay for like 200 something bucks and I needed the money but it's like why did I do that like I had I just walked into the store and bought it I never touched it you could play ours if you want

34
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:12,767
[SPEAKER_14]: The N64 I got for Ocarina of Time because at that age I was very elitist and snobby about CD-ROM versus card and how Nintendo was making the wrong decision.

35
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:20,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought an N64 just for Ocarina of Time and I never really played any other game aside from that.

36
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:22,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought a bunch of games for the N64 and never touched them.

37
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:24,795
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was probably a waste of money.

38
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:25,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

39
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,936
[SPEAKER_28]: Now you're talking the games you regret buying, right?

40
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, those are my two for that.

41
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:38,282
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have any for the one that I had answered about the system or game you regret not buying?

42
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:46,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I really wish I could have checked out the TurboGrafx, but that was a bit out of my league at the time.

43
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,031
[SPEAKER_28]: My friend had one, and at the time, I thought it was kind of stupid.

44
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:49,911
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta be honest.

45
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,652
[SPEAKER_28]: The games I played on it were not that great.

46
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:58,695
[SPEAKER_28]: We played Splatterhouse, which was kind of cool, in the fact that it was Splatterhouse, and it was kind of like a horror movie type game.

47
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:01,396
[SPEAKER_28]: But otherwise, I didn't find the games on it to be that great.

48
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,638
[SPEAKER_28]: And to this day, I gotta admit, I know DarkSakura's got a lot of love for it.

49
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:07,698
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe it's because she's out of the room.

50
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:08,698
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll dare to say this.

51
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,939
[SPEAKER_28]: I still kind of think the whole thing was kind of overrated.

52
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,080
[SPEAKER_28]: It wasn't that great of a system, I don't think.

53
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:21,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was the only system that got the original Street Fighter, and it also got, you know, Castlevania X, the lost Castlevania game until recently.

54
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,383
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's cool, but, you know, how many of us actually played that?

55
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:27,805
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, sure, Jamie did, but she's, you know, cray-cray.

56
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:28,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

57
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:28,906
[SPEAKER_14]: In a good way.

58
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:34,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Aside from that, all the systems that were even a little bit relevant, I had at one point, I did get a Genesis.

59
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:39,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I got it years after everyone else, but I got it before the PlayStation 1 came out.

60
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:44,240
[SPEAKER_14]: The 32X and the Sega CD were all considered failures, so...

61
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,267
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, don't really have much regrets there.

62
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,169
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the original Lunar on a ROM.

63
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I can play it on my computer.

64
00:04:54,452 --> 00:05:05,020
[SPEAKER_28]: For me, the system that I regret buying, like not, don't, or regret not buying, but the system I regret buying that I kind of wish I hadn't was a second DS.

65
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:11,065
[SPEAKER_28]: I had a DS Fat and then the original DS and then I bought a DS Lite and I don't think I really needed that Lite.

66
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,046
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't handheld game at all.

67
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,487
[SPEAKER_28]: PSP Fat PSP Fat PSP Fat

68
00:05:32,518 --> 00:06:00,881
[SPEAKER_28]: I did and I ended up getting a PSP 3000 as well but you know what I actually would play the PSP probably more than I did the DS just the certain games that were on it with Luminous and the Final Fantasy remakes and so forth I mean don't get me wrong the DS had its games too but I don't know also the PSP 1 I kind of wore it down and it didn't work as well anymore so it kind of justified for me the PSP 3000 even though that's probably not like the greatest reason to have one if that makes sense but yeah

69
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:11,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the idea of buying a movie on UMD is kind of ridiculous, but if you can get Kill Bill on UMD, it fries for like five bucks.

70
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,923
[SPEAKER_14]: That's got a better screen on it than your iPhone does, really.

71
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:14,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

72
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:15,764
[SPEAKER_14]: To watch a movie on that.

73
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:16,645
[SPEAKER_28]: Good stuff.

74
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:25,511
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, we're talking about the system or console you regret most buying, and then the one you regret not buying.

75
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,798
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really have anything that I regret buying.

76
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:34,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess if I was going to pick one, it'd be the GameCom because it was awful.

77
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,280
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even regret the N-Gage because I had some good stuff on there.

78
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:47,202
[SPEAKER_18]: But as far as things I regret not buying... You know, it's funny.

79
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:50,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Robert M. in chat gave the same answer almost at the same time.

80
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:50,863
[SPEAKER_28]: The GameCom.

81
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:51,803
[SPEAKER_28]: This is where you're at.

82
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:53,584
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm...

83
00:06:57,915 --> 00:06:58,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Bradley?

84
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:58,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Bradley?

85
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:26,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's see.

86
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:29,097
[SPEAKER_03]: What I regret probably not buying was I never got a Dreamcast.

87
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:33,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear all the great stories about it, and I just never got around to it.

88
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:34,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

89
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:36,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this might have been the time.

90
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:40,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have a job at the time, so I couldn't get it.

91
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:43,128
[SPEAKER_28]: The system was truly ahead of its time.

92
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:48,973
[SPEAKER_28]: If it had come out like two years later with DVD support, I honestly think it would have whooped the PlayStation 2.

93
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,054
[SPEAKER_28]: I really, truly think that.

94
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:52,335
[SPEAKER_28]: I know I'm crazy, but I do.

95
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:53,396
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

96
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:59,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any systems that I regret buying because I think I like all my systems that I have.

97
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:11,432
[SPEAKER_03]: His story about Panzer Dragoon reminds me, I actually had to sell mine off because I had no money at the time and I really regret doing that and really didn't want to buy it back.

98
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:20,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did win an auction for it on eBay for like 200-something bucks, but the guy never shipped it, which was really annoying.

99
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:24,103
[SPEAKER_03]: He kept saying he was going to ship it, but he didn't, and he gave him like a fake code or something.

100
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:30,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But since I did it through PayPal, I was able to get the money back, at least for that, so I can see if I can find it again sometime.

101
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,895
[SPEAKER_03]: The game I regret buying was the sequel to Alex Kidd and Miracle World.

102
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:39,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what it was called, Alex Kidd 2 something.

103
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:43,199
[SPEAKER_03]: is just because it... I'll say what in Miracle World is a great game.

104
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a while to get through it and it takes a while to figure it out.

105
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:56,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I played it again like a few years ago and I couldn't get through it because there's like some spikes and stuff in the last few levels that can be kind of hard to get past.

106
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But the second game is like, it's a really easy... Instead of having like...

107
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:11,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it doesn't, it's not like the map like the first one has and, and the first one, first one is not exactly as linear, it's not linear.

108
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:16,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you can go, or it's not left to, just left to right is left to right and then you're up and down depending on the level.

109
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:21,119
[SPEAKER_03]: But on, in the second game, you only go left to right and it's actually a really easy game.

110
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And I beat, I beat it the first, first, first day and it's like really disappointing.

111
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a bit, pretty much because of how great the first game was.

112
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:32,923
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

113
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:34,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answers, guys.

114
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:35,064
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

115
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,545
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we're going to do some quick news stories.

116
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:41,987
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a couple left over that we never got around to, and then we actually have some other discussion topics.

117
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:48,910
[SPEAKER_28]: So, DarkSakura, I don't know if you have the piece on the last one that we had left over that we didn't get to before dinner.

118
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, good.

119
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,910
[SPEAKER_18]: About Telltale.

120
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:59,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, Telltale's doing a five-episode Back to the Future series, and it's going to have Marty McFly and Doc Brown.

121
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,875
[SPEAKER_18]: It has Christopher Lloyd voicing Doc Brown, which is great.

122
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:23,159
[SPEAKER_18]: and Hill Valley being 1985 and guidance from the screenwriter Bob Gale and the DeLorean so they're still working on getting the rest of it up but there's still a bit missing you know I guess what hoverboards and Huey Lewis in the news

123
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,401
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm looking forward to seeing what the actual game looks like.

124
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:29,903
[SPEAKER_28]: We've heard a lot of talk about the game and kind of ramping up to it.

125
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,725
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kind of excited to see what the damn thing actually looks like, but I'm sure it'll be fine.

126
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:34,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I have some trivia for you.

127
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:35,887
[SPEAKER_28]: You can kind of guess.

128
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:37,207
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I tell you a secret?

129
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,629
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people are going to judge me for this, but I don't really care.

130
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,671
[SPEAKER_28]: I have never seen Back to the Future 1 or 2.

131
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:44,732
[SPEAKER_19]: We can fix that.

132
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,192
[SPEAKER_28]: But I have seen Part 3.

133
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:47,133
[SPEAKER_28]: Isn't that weird?

134
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,554
[SPEAKER_28]: The Wild West one, right?

135
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:49,634
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw 1 and then I saw 3.

136
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't see 2 for the longest time.

137
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:52,276
[SPEAKER_28]: I never saw 1 or 2.

138
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,128
[SPEAKER_18]: But Rob, here's some trivia for you.

139
00:10:56,228 --> 00:11:02,694
[SPEAKER_18]: On the Back to the Future pinball table, you know that Michael J. Fox would not allow his likeness to be used, so they made a generic looking dude.

140
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,616
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I know that because you've brought it up on the show before.

141
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:06,777
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, true story.

142
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:07,638
[SPEAKER_28]: True story.

143
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:09,798
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

144
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:16,960
[SPEAKER_28]: One other story for you guys, and it has to do with the Connect Beta is going on right now, of course.

145
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,421
[SPEAKER_28]: They're starting to ship out and all that good stuff.

146
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:22,741
[SPEAKER_28]: Someone is trying to sell theirs on eBay.

147
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:29,283
[SPEAKER_28]: They're trying to get $1,200 for it, but it was quickly taken offline.

148
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:33,864
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm assuming Microsoft sent a cease and desist to the kind folks at eBay.

149
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,050
[SPEAKER_28]: So probably Microsoft did not take kindly to the fact that the unit was being sold.

150
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:45,178
[SPEAKER_28]: The seller on eBay was Blue Room Project and there were no bids actually made on the system.

151
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,120
[SPEAKER_28]: So there it was.

152
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:58,913
[SPEAKER_28]: What's interesting about it though is that I would think that this, and the article kind of gets into this too, is that you would think these connects are going to be sending back quite a bit of data to Microsoft servers.

153
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:03,176
[SPEAKER_28]: So it could kind of figure out who's playing connect that shouldn't be, right?

154
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:12,262
[SPEAKER_28]: Like if you get a connect early, aren't you kind of setting yourself up for trouble unless you never sign on to Xbox Live, which I guess you could do, but then how would you get the patches and all that stuff?

155
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,043
[SPEAKER_28]: It just seems tricky, tricky.

156
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:30,110
[SPEAKER_28]: I wish Loki was here to explain a little more about how you could get around that but I'm just thinking, you know what, probably not a good idea to just buy these that you don't really have the rights because Microsoft can track what goes online and you're going to have to go online to get some of the patches and updates so it just doesn't make sense.

157
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,611
[SPEAKER_28]: That was it for the news.

158
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:37,053
[SPEAKER_28]: That was all the news we had set to cover this show.

159
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:41,235
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you have more stories you want to talk about, we're actually going to open up the Skype line.

160
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,235
[SPEAKER_28]: Now it is open, folks.

161
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:45,616
[SPEAKER_28]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

162
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,517
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to take some more calls.

163
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:51,139
[SPEAKER_28]: So you can either call us and talk to us about a news story or really anything you've heard about tonight.

164
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:57,441
[SPEAKER_28]: Or you can send us a tweet at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

165
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,042
[SPEAKER_28]: You can send us a tweet.

166
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:05,306
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'll read those again in a little bit if we're getting some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

167
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:10,630
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think DarkSakura had mentioned something about wanting to do the mailbag again, but I don't know if any letters have dropped in.

168
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,493
[SPEAKER_28]: But we're kind of monitoring all those pretty closely right now.

169
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:17,075
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm actually going to kind of load up the tweets.

170
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,857
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see how those are going.

171
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:20,877
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we are getting some calls.

172
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:21,578
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's go to the phones.

173
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,080
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

174
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

175
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,021
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, this is X-Link.

176
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:26,742
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, X-Link.

177
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:28,203
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome to Hour 7 of the marathon.

178
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:28,623
[SPEAKER_28]: How are you doing?

179
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Doing good, and you?

180
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:32,308
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm still awake, that's a good thing.

181
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,029
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind?

182
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing much.

183
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:43,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm really excited to hear that they are going to do a miniseries based on Back to the Future, which is hopefully going to be epic.

184
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:49,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Now they're getting actual actors to do the voices from the movie and stuff, so that's pretty cool.

185
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,844
[SPEAKER_15]: I would love to see Michael J. Fox to come on also, because that would be excellent.

186
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:53,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

187
00:13:55,371 --> 00:14:02,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, Telltale also got cited for because they announced a new poker game coming out this fall with different characters from different game series.

188
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:17,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Poker Night at the Inventory with Tycho from Penny Arcade, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Max from Sandman Max, and then the Heavy from Team Fortress 2.

189
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:41,916
[SPEAKER_28]: so that should be pretty interesting of a poker game when they get that all said and done yeah we to be fair it was brought up about six hours ago but yeah we did talk about it a little bit but um it sounds kind of interesting i'm not usually like a somebody that gets like super into the uh poker games but um i kind of like where this one's going it's an interesting hodgepodge of characters what do you kind of hope you get out of this poker game

190
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:43,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the wackiness.

191
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:52,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Because of Telltale and the way they're going to put this together, there's going to be some kind of epic fighting going on between characters and stuff, which is going to be absolutely great to see.

192
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,825
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the over-slapstick humor that they usually do with some of their games.

193
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,185
[SPEAKER_28]: Good times.

194
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:00,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Awesome.

195
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:02,508
[SPEAKER_28]: So what else is on your mind?

196
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:02,888
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything?

197
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:07,647
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I've been playing a lot of WoW, as of course you should know.

198
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Of course, because I play a lot of WoW too.

199
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:10,589
[SPEAKER_28]: Fancy that.

200
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we all do.

201
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,392
[SPEAKER_28]: What are some of your WoW accomplishments recently?

202
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, almost had the, uh, TOC 25, which I would have been very proud of.

203
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:26,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, uh, you know, just a lot of different odds and ends, uh, ICC getting farther than that now in the 10 man.

204
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:38,001
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, the guild, um, you know, just, and hopefully I'm really going to be proud because I'm going to try to go for some of the other odds and ends like the fishing mounts and stuff like that.

205
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:38,941
[SPEAKER_15]: So awesome.

206
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:41,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

207
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:41,763
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um,

208
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:43,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

209
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,447
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go and take more calls?

210
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:48,408
[SPEAKER_28]: Nope, that's pretty much about it.

211
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:49,649
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you have a good night.

212
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:50,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Good luck with WoW.

213
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:51,329
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

214
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,650
[SPEAKER_15]: You too.

215
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,290
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, bye.

216
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,991
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

217
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:59,533
[SPEAKER_28]: 1877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

218
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,754
[SPEAKER_28]: You can give us a call.

219
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:04,615
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

220
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,095
[SPEAKER_28]: I was just ringing off the hook a minute ago, so I'm hoping more calls will come in.

221
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,196
[SPEAKER_28]: We are getting some tweets.

222
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:11,796
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you guys.

223
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,097
[SPEAKER_28]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

224
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,758
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll get to those in just a moment.

225
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,520
[SPEAKER_28]: How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?

226
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,980
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you good?

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm a little boozy.

228
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:25,947
[SPEAKER_28]: From the drinking?

229
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:27,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

230
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,209
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm starting to get a little like, hey.

231
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Brandy hits me really fast.

232
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,211
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care.

233
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:30,611
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

234
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:31,912
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

235
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:32,272
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

236
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,954
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

237
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:35,955
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, Spazinator.

238
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:36,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Welcome to the marathon.

239
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,356
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind?

240
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:39,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

241
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:48,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is probably a question that's probably better answered by Loki, but since he took off a few hours ago, I'll ask you guys.

242
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:54,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of sort of toying around with the idea of...

243
00:16:55,615 --> 00:17:01,459
[SPEAKER_05]: more or less recreating an arcade kit that I once saw going years back.

244
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've ever seen this one particular model.

245
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It had Samurai Shodown 4 in it and basically the configuration was it came in two pieces.

246
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,412
[SPEAKER_05]: One section had the

247
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:25,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Joysticks and the buns and the coin slots and all that.

248
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:30,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe the second piece was basically the modern.

249
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,741
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like five or ten feet away.

250
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:38,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was like a set of chains licking the two together.

251
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:40,243
[SPEAKER_28]: Wait, wait, wait.

252
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:41,003
[SPEAKER_28]: You got to back up here.

253
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:44,544
[SPEAKER_28]: This was a special machine or a custom machine you're saying?

254
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:54,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think I'm more or less recreating at least part of the custom machine for myself.

255
00:17:55,545 --> 00:18:04,070
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the control, the part with the controls on it.

256
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:14,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from the part with the controls like the joystick and all that, I was wondering, what kind of materials do you think I should be...

257
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:21,991
[SPEAKER_05]: using to build the cabinet itself, like, should I use, like, particle board and laminate, or...

258
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:43,478
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, this is definitely a Loki question because I don't know anything about this stuff, but I will tell you one somewhat cheap alternative that I've heard being used before is actually trying to find old arcade cabinets that, for whatever reason, the games inside them don't work anymore because the cabinets seem to make pretty good shells for these custom cabinets for whatever it is you're trying to build, a Samurai Shodown 4 case or whatever it is.

259
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:51,863
[SPEAKER_28]: Those are usually a really good place to start, at least from what I've heard, and I think that's what quite a few people have done.

260
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,252
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, don't you guys have a custom cabinet?

261
00:18:56,713 --> 00:19:00,196
[SPEAKER_18]: We just modified a pole position back in the day.

262
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:06,900
[SPEAKER_18]: And used it and put a... Dan built the layout and everything with the buttons and joysticks.

263
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:16,366
[SPEAKER_28]: Otherwise, as far as specific materials that work best, not really my realm of expertise because I've never built a cabinet, so I'm not going to profess to know that stuff.

264
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,227
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm sure there are some websites.

265
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, Loki's a good resource when he's here.

266
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:22,530
[SPEAKER_28]: When he's not babysitting.

267
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:33,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, my goal is to, let's say, to use this as just an example.

268
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:51,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking of getting one of those $150 arcade sticks for the PS3 or 360, drop that into the cabinet, run the arcade stick flyers to my game system, and then try to have my...

269
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I know that Loki was also going to be working on a project about building arcade cabinets for like a hundred bucks.

270
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,234
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, I'm all about building on a budget.

271
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:10,775
[SPEAKER_28]: That's for sure.

272
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

273
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for taking my call.

274
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:15,877
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

275
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:17,038
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

276
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:17,778
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one.

277
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:18,399
[SPEAKER_28]: You too, buddy.

278
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:18,899
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good night.

279
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:20,118
[SPEAKER_28]: YouTube

280
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:49,899
[SPEAKER_28]: Legend of Zaku from your cell phone Oh wow, you guys are really pushing it this time, aren't you?

281
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:17,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little bit.

282
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:23,530
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't done a show this long since DDR tournaments, that's for sure.

283
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:25,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

284
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:33,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, apparently the biggest thing right now is Duke Nukem Forever basically coming back from the dead in a more spectacular way.

285
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I never thought it would actually happen.

286
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:39,564
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yes, what do you think about all this news that has come out of Penny Arcade Expo?

287
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:54,287
[SPEAKER_06]: All I know is that they better just stick to the schedule and get it out because the last thing we need is for other folks to just have this game be the butt of everyone's joke again.

288
00:21:55,368 --> 00:22:00,730
[SPEAKER_28]: At the same time though, at this point, Zaku, what's another year?

289
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,732
[SPEAKER_28]: If they delay it to 2012, what's another year at this point?

290
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But the game is so close.

291
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:10,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, people are already playing a demo of it and

292
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:13,355
[SPEAKER_06]: What I hear is like at polishing stages.

293
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:15,060
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I get it.

294
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like.

295
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:17,224
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree.

296
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:23,428
[SPEAKER_28]: If they're showing it on the floor at Penny Arcade Expo, it's darn close to done.

297
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,590
[SPEAKER_28]: Showing it at Penny Arcade Expo, keep in mind, they bypassed E3 to make this announcement.

298
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:33,873
[SPEAKER_28]: If this has been in development since 2009, they could have announced this at E3, but they didn't.

299
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:38,956
[SPEAKER_28]: They went and took it directly to people like you and me at Penny Arcade Expo.

300
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:43,318
[SPEAKER_28]: That's like unzipping it and whipping it out on the table for everybody to admire.

301
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:43,638
[SPEAKER_28]: That's...

302
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:49,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, this game actually appeals to the hardcore demographic.

303
00:22:50,223 --> 00:23:02,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily something you would want, you know, average Joe gamer who pretty much doesn't have a clue as to what Duke Nukem is, unless they have been playing during the, you know, mid to late 90s.

304
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:05,519
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty much.

305
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:08,422
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, the whole point is that, I guess, I kind of find it surprising that the first, you know,

306
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:39,491
[SPEAKER_06]: The studio behind Borderlands and the guy who founded it pretty much has a connection to 3D Realms and the folks who ran it up until its demise.

307
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:44,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I never thought that guy's career is pretty much owed to Duke Nukem.

308
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:50,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, now I'm wondering, though, if they knew that they had this game, that Gearbox has had this game since 2009.

309
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:53,634
[SPEAKER_28]: When did Duke Nukem come out?

310
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:54,975
[SPEAKER_28]: Didn't it come out about a year ago?

311
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:55,375
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess...

312
00:23:56,485 --> 00:24:02,531
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, all I know is that basically, when I read in the article, like a Taco article where they interviewed, you know, that guy, basically...

313
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:26,656
[SPEAKER_06]: After 3D Realms shut down, most of it was pretty much a two-bit operation running from people's apartments.

314
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:31,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much a garage game up until a point where Gearbox took control of it.

315
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty much coming together piecemeal.

316
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:47,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no way you would mount something unless you have a solid backing from a developer who's able to actually finish the job instead of putting it through development hell.

317
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:49,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah.

318
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, you know, again, it's been shown now.

319
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that is actually going to come out.

320
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:54,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll, you know, see what happens.

321
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:19,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

322
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully everything will make sense.

323
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:28,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And at least I could hear more one-liners out of this guy.

324
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:31,475
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much what OLR needs.

325
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:35,036
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot more Duke Nukem one-liners out of nowhere.

326
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:37,196
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

327
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,317
[SPEAKER_28]: The soundboard is kind of saved for special occasions.

328
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:39,877
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

329
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,258
[SPEAKER_28]: And real quick, a comment from our chatroom.

330
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,239
[SPEAKER_28]: Derek H is asking, is the caller saying that 3D Realms was a garage development house?

331
00:25:47,498 --> 00:26:06,229
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just saying that after 3D Realms blew up because of Duke Nukem Forever's development, the folks from 3D Realms, in the transition to Gearbox, in between that time, started working on Duke Nukem Forever from their apartment.

332
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:15,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of it during that time with 3D Realms' demise, until it got handed over to Gearbox, was pretty much a two-bit operation.

333
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:19,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I know 3D Realms is pretty much a big name studio back in the day.

334
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:25,159
[SPEAKER_06]: They turned out a lot of PC titles that I'm pretty much fond of.

335
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:34,898
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's going to be great.

336
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:44,203
[SPEAKER_28]: The only thing that's going to be sad is that since it's not just like Borderlands, you're not going to get quests in Duke Nukem as far as I know, so it won't be like, hey, you need to go up to the stripper and tipper.

337
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:47,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Although I guess you do have to press R to pee in the toilet.

338
00:26:49,286 --> 00:27:00,432
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the whole point of Duke Nukem is just pick up and play, kill people, max out on your... try to get all the power-ups and weapons and just go all out with

339
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:05,201
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the whole point, is that you're just killing, you're just shooting people, like Doom.

340
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:09,705
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead, you're just like, you know, you're killing a lot more aliens and monsters.

341
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:11,106
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

342
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:12,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And with a lot of one-liners.

343
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:19,173
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, Zaku, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but I hope you can get your hands on Duke Nukem soon, and see it's the real thing.

344
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:19,614
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

345
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:20,635
[SPEAKER_28]: Later.

346
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,057
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one.

347
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:25,219
[SPEAKER_28]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

348
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,179
[SPEAKER_28]: We got another call coming in.

349
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:27,120
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

350
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,441
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

351
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:31,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is DJ Blaziken.

352
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:48,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Not much other than I've been listening to this whole marathon shindig since it started up and the whole music break thing is bringing me back to the old days, back from the really old episode that I started listening to you guys back on your old station.

353
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:51,970
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I'm glad to hear it.

354
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,531
[SPEAKER_28]: That's kind of the idea behind it.

355
00:27:53,571 --> 00:28:00,577
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, for those that are listening on the podcast, we can't do the copyrighted music that we were playing during our little breaks here for meals and potty and all that stuff.

356
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:02,359
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, we're playing a lot of the music.

357
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:16,451
[SPEAKER_28]: When Orange Launch Radio, back when we were a station on Live 365, we would play music from DDR and just a variety of the other music-based games and some of the Dance Mania CDs that inspired the music song list in DDR and so forth.

358
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:27,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, which, of all things, okay, I've been a little bit on a Jersey Shore fanatic point, so I've been fist-pumping throughout the whole breaks.

359
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:28,994
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

360
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,735
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that about this program.

361
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:33,435
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a first for everything.

362
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:44,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, by the way, actually, just thinking of systems I regret not buying, systems I do regret buying, um,

363
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:55,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow, I regret not buying a Sega Dreamcast myself.

364
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:59,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And, actually, you know what?

365
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:06,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Outside of the second system, I regret not buying, because I had a kick-ass fighting game on it, was the N64.

366
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:14,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, it had killer instinct, and the controller itself, the standard controller, was perfect for fighting games.

367
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:18,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to admit, I got used to Street Fighter on a Super Nintendo controller.

368
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:22,677
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole fact that some of the punches and kicks were shoulder buttons totally didn't bother me.

369
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:23,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I was able to get used to it.

370
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:27,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever remember the Capcom controller that they came out for the Super Nintendo?

371
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:28,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

372
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:43,534
[SPEAKER_28]: No, and I thought that was on the Genesis.

373
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:45,854
[SPEAKER_18]: They did it in Japan.

374
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:51,876
[SPEAKER_18]: The six button controller where you held part of it in your hand and you played with the top of your fingers.

375
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,677
[SPEAKER_18]: It was kind of uncomfortable.

376
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,298
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it sounds it.

377
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:09,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, a game I regret not buying, but I've actually got to play, well, I now finally got to buy and own, is Full Calibur.

378
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:38,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Dreamcast good stuff I wish I had Goldeneye too cause god I mean occasionally my friend would bring it over to the daycare occasionally and he'd bring it over to N64 and we'd all just sit down four player multiplayer it was just epicness and even though I never owned it it was just like god I wish I could plop some money down on that and now that I think about it

379
00:30:40,067 --> 00:31:06,774
[SPEAKER_09]: a game that I do regret buying wow it would have to be DDR Disney Channel Edition you must have been a real DDR completionist to get that yeah it's another DDR worthy of the whole old bumper from Step Squad saying this DDR sucks saying to Solo

380
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:09,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Solo was actually pretty good.

381
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Solo was awesome.

382
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:15,346
[SPEAKER_28]: That was some of the best music they had in DDR ever, especially Solo 2000.

383
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:16,747
[SPEAKER_28]: It was amazing.

384
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:23,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think my arcade had the Solo 2000, but stupid idiots trade for Pump It Up.

385
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:26,067
[SPEAKER_28]: Not even the second.

386
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:33,851
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to back up real quick, because you were talking about the Dreamcast and missing out on that and everything, which was the same thing I said for the system that I kind of regret not buying.

387
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:41,796
[SPEAKER_28]: But then I also think about it, and it's like, you know, at that time in my life, there was no way I could have paid that type of money for that system.

388
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:46,318
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I was barely out of college, and I didn't really have a job.

389
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,139
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I sort of worked temp jobs in the summer and so forth.

390
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,200
[SPEAKER_28]: There was no way I would have been able to afford one.

391
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:51,521
[SPEAKER_28]: So...

392
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:58,723
[SPEAKER_28]: I regret not being able to afford it, I guess, but I couldn't buy it.

393
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:04,685
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess I can't say I don't regret not buying one because I was able to buy food and other things.

394
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:16,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, contrary to the whole gym casting, the babysitter my mom sent me to a bunch of times, he had a bunch of systems to play and six or seven arcade games.

395
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:23,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Mortal Kombat 2, Asteroids, Snow Bros, and Defender I was like 6, 7, 10 Yeah, and Mortal Kombat 4 He had Final Doom on the Playstation I played that a lot

396
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:50,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, when one of his friends would come over, we'd link up the two playstations to play four-player Final Doom.

397
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:57,830
[SPEAKER_09]: And, once again, FPS Epicness, which, that's why I ended up buying, what was it?

398
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:05,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I ended up buying Doom on Xbox Live and Soul Calibur Am I the only one that's like what's wrong with this picture?

399
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,803
[SPEAKER_28]: Why is the six year old being allowed to play Mortal Kombat 2 and Doom when he's with the Manny?

400
00:33:14,144 --> 00:33:26,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get that But the cool thing was not only that did I play it in his house but on the occasions I'd go over to the mall and then my mom she was searching for me

401
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:46,899
[SPEAKER_09]: and so she knew I was in the arcade section of the mall at the time and this is the same mall that won't fix their ITG machine it's still down which sucks but at the time they had a Mortal Kombat 4 arcade machine and I would play that constantly because there was only one token to play and how old were you, 8?

402
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I was 10 and actually the first game I ever got actually the first game system I ever got was a Game Boy

403
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:57,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Boy Pocket.

404
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:13,811
[SPEAKER_09]: The first two games I got, one was a combo game cartridge, Mortal Kombat 1 and 2, and the other was Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back, which I loved the cantina song that would play whenever the characters were bringing up dialogue.

405
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:18,229
[SPEAKER_28]: And those games didn't screw you up as a kid?

406
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, you're fine now?

407
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,771
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a good sense of reality?

408
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,432
[SPEAKER_28]: You're stable mentally and all that good stuff?

409
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:22,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

410
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:26,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, my mom was like, it's too violent, blah, blah, blah.

411
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:27,836
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll make you go crazy.

412
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:28,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, really?

413
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:41,066
[SPEAKER_09]: And I bought GTA Liberty City Stories behind her back on Amazon for a PSP hacking point because it was used to get the hen to activate.

414
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:45,415
[SPEAKER_09]: but it ended up not working as well as I thought the hack would work.

415
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:50,017
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just had fun with that and she never knew about it.

416
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:57,820
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you told your mom recently about all these things you were playing behind her back when you were growing up?

417
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:06,563
[SPEAKER_09]: She kind of figured out after a while what I was playing but she didn't care by the time I was... She was like, here's the good thing.

418
00:35:07,123 --> 00:35:09,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't become that stupid Virginia Tech...

419
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:13,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Shooter, or the Von Maher Shooter, which you probably might have heard about.

420
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:16,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've heard about them.

421
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:20,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I didn't go out and shoot at the high school.

422
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go out with a sniper rifle and shoot a bunch of people.

423
00:35:23,575 --> 00:35:32,301
[SPEAKER_09]: If I felt like I wanted to deck someone in the face, I waited until I got home or got on the bus, started up GTA, and started beating up random civilians in games.

424
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,663
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my anchor management.

425
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:42,888
[SPEAKER_28]: I like what Hoofhearted says in chat, saying, My father didn't care that I played MK, but my mom got scared and said, You're going to live with your auntie in Bel-Air.

426
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,170
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

427
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:51,293
[SPEAKER_28]: Blaze, I've got to let you go so we can try and get some more calls and do more Marathon.

428
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:52,113
[SPEAKER_28]: But thank you for the call.

429
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:53,194
[SPEAKER_09]: One last thing.

430
00:35:55,115 --> 00:36:00,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, basically the PSP in of itself is almost like a Super Nintendo controller in of itself with a screen.

431
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:02,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Just with an analog stick.

432
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:16,808
[SPEAKER_09]: and Alpha 3 Max plays fine and I go between that and Street Fighter 4 and I'm looking to get in the EVO tournament one day and beat Daigel Well good luck to you

433
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, peace out, and have a good rockin' show.

434
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,056
[SPEAKER_28]: We will, we'll try.

435
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:22,997
[SPEAKER_28]: Later!

436
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,218
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for being a part of the marathon.

437
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,100
[SPEAKER_28]: That was kind of a marathon phone call here on the Village Lounge Radio Marathon.

438
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:33,423
[SPEAKER_28]: Ah, we can probably do one or two more, whatever, I got nothing else to do.

439
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:34,604
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

440
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,427
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm trying to look in our chat room.

441
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:39,472
[SPEAKER_28]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which is still pretty full here.

442
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:41,996
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

443
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:43,017
[SPEAKER_28]: What was the question?

444
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:47,004
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, BetaCNCRA was asking, why is the show only on Sundays?

445
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:48,386
[SPEAKER_28]: Why can't it be on every day?

446
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:50,166
[SPEAKER_18]: We have this thing called lives.

447
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:52,248
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that and a job.

448
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,589
[SPEAKER_28]: And this show doesn't pay us anything.

449
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,592
[SPEAKER_28]: In fact, we actually pay to do this show.

450
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,554
[SPEAKER_28]: Although we don't pay very much anymore.

451
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:01,975
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't have to pay for a feed anymore.

452
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,957
[SPEAKER_28]: The fine folks at All Games Radio help subsidize that.

453
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:08,980
[SPEAKER_18]: But wait until I can show you the bill for our mixing board.

454
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:09,461
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

455
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,142
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

456
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:11,542
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

457
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hello there.

458
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:14,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

459
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:14,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.

460
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:15,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.

461
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:22,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that Swede, who's been with you all this time.

462
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,049
[SPEAKER_28]: Good morning to you, my friend.

463
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,371
[SPEAKER_28]: So, gosh, when we started, it was probably, what, like midnight where you are?

464
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:30,553
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was... What was it?

465
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember... No, no, no.

466
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 11 o'clock or something.

467
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:35,195
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, that's not too bad.

468
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:38,637
[SPEAKER_28]: If I remember... We've been going for seven hours now.

469
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:39,597
[SPEAKER_28]: So, seven and a half.

470
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,178
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, my God.

471
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:41,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Seven and a half hours.

472
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:41,578
[SPEAKER_28]: So, do the math.

473
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:43,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well... Whatever.

474
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,181
[SPEAKER_04]: But, oh, well, what was I going to say?

475
00:37:48,261 --> 00:38:03,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, Mass Effect is kind of interesting, almost, in that sense that, well, finally, DLC for that game will show up.

476
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:07,915
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah, because that's right, Mass Effect 2, right?

477
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,377
[SPEAKER_28]: Has it had a lot of download content come out?

478
00:38:11,738 --> 00:38:14,760
[SPEAKER_04]: DLC that you actually want to buy, because...

479
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:21,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because that backstory with the Shadow Broker is like, winner!

480
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:22,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

481
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:23,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

482
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:26,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

483
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:30,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already have actually read the comic for it.

484
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:35,953
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mass Effect Redemption comic.

485
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:43,818
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about... Which takes place actually around that, before Mass Effect, around that time when...

486
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:49,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it takes place, like, before Mass Effect 2.

487
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:54,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect movie would be kinda nice in some way, but...

488
00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:21,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my problem though is that my Shepard is not male.

489
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:23,360
[SPEAKER_04]: She's female.

490
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:26,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Shepard is female.

491
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Point!

492
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:30,065
[SPEAKER_28]: Shepard can be whoever you want them to be.

493
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:30,746
[SPEAKER_28]: That is true.

494
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:31,486
[SPEAKER_28]: That is true.

495
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:37,011
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, completely not what you were asking, but I only play female characters in Warcraft.

496
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,204
[SPEAKER_28]: because people treat you better.

497
00:39:39,804 --> 00:40:05,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so do I. Even though the ironic thing about that front is that, well, I didn't get to max level at... I didn't get to max level that soon, actually, because I, like... I didn't hit max level, but then I think I did at some point.

498
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:06,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

499
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I mostly played female characters, too.

500
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:11,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens?

501
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I roll a troll male and I hit max level.

502
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:46,343
[SPEAKER_28]: it's funny the characters you will get most invested in out of everything else I gotta read this comment from chat real quick DDR Dollar says in our chat room this caller reminds me of when I was younger and said the avatar from Ultima was female you know yeah when I played Ultima Quest for the Avatar on the NES usually like half of the different class types you could get were females and I think usually the one I would opt to play is like the druid I think or the shepherdess and both were female

503
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:52,405
[SPEAKER_28]: Unfortunately, I can't think of any system that I regret buying in some way.

504
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:19,523
[SPEAKER_04]: because I don't get any of my system buys, unfortunately.

505
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:25,711
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I might regret is that I smashed two Game Boys in my time.

506
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:26,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I really...

507
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:37,797
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was play, and I actually know the two games that I did play.

508
00:41:38,197 --> 00:41:45,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of it was that I smashed my original Game Boy while I was playing Kirby's Pinball Land.

509
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:48,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awesome.

510
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:54,831
[SPEAKER_04]: The other time was when I smashed my other Game Boy Pocket.

511
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,108
[SPEAKER_04]: playing Wario Land for some strange reason.

512
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:01,290
[SPEAKER_28]: Those Nintendo pinball games were so freaking good, though.

513
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,092
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, the Pokemon pinball was so awesome.

514
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:05,834
[SPEAKER_28]: I used to play that on it.

515
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:07,995
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think I would have broke a Game Boy over it, but, you know.

516
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:13,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but here's the other thing, though.

517
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:16,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I have... Oh, but here's the other thing, though.

518
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:22,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I was much younger at that time because I was like 12 or something when I...

519
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:24,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we lost the connection there.

520
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:24,963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bummer.

521
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,264
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope we didn't lose the whole damn internet again.

522
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:54,499
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, good.

523
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,740
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's still showing us connected and I see the chat room going there, so we're good.

524
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:01,162
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, unfortunately, we lost Hockey Ripper, but Anger Management.

525
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:02,422
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to talk about this, actually.

526
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:11,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's talk about your most angry video game moment that just made you like you wanted to break shit or something like that.

527
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,126
[SPEAKER_28]: Angry video game moment.

528
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:15,247
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, it looks like you're thinking of something.

529
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:24,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Mike Tyson's punch out, the guy in the turban that span around and he had the little gem on his turban that sparkled when he was going to do his move.

530
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:25,299
[SPEAKER_28]: Tiger something, yes.

531
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Him, he brought me to tears.

532
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:29,563
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you actually cry over a video?

533
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:30,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I cried so much over that guy.

534
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,041
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome.

535
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:37,283
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't beat him and it just, I cried.

536
00:43:37,643 --> 00:43:46,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Would you actually do the whole like crying into your pillow thing where you like you throw the controller down and jump on your bed and go No, it was far more heart-wrenching.

537
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:47,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

538
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:48,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you describe?

539
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:50,577
[SPEAKER_14]: I was utterly defeated as a person.

540
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:55,362
[SPEAKER_14]: My nine, ten year old self just had like these bitter tears of

541
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:58,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Several people in chat, thank you.

542
00:43:58,058 --> 00:43:59,299
[SPEAKER_28]: GreatTiger was his name.

543
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,960
[SPEAKER_28]: You've clearly tried to block that from your mind.

544
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,920
[SPEAKER_28]: GreatTiger made you cry.

545
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

546
00:44:06,181 --> 00:44:09,682
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to make you a little t-shirt or something with this picture on it.

547
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:10,883
[SPEAKER_28]: GreatTiger made me cry.

548
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:11,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's the thing.

549
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:17,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually got up to Mike Tyson in that game, and I never actually beat it because he was impossible.

550
00:44:18,085 --> 00:44:19,986
[SPEAKER_14]: But yet I was like, this is...

551
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:25,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, this is just stupid how hard this is.

552
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:30,625
[SPEAKER_14]: So then I just stopped playing to Mike Tyson, but that one boss, I just cried.

553
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:38,110
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I've thrown controllers, like power outages have made me throw controllers, which is very frustrating.

554
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,312
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't think of any boss fights or anything that have really driven me to that, or cry.

555
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:45,233
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't get a drop in WoW the other day.

556
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:46,894
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

557
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:48,295
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not that bad.

558
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:50,156
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll do the Huffy stomp.

559
00:44:50,196 --> 00:44:50,516
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll do the...

560
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:56,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you roll like a 95 and then someone else... That happened.

561
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:59,239
[SPEAKER_14]: That fucking shit happened to you last week.

562
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:00,800
[SPEAKER_28]: I knew it.

563
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,540
[SPEAKER_28]: And you were like, no, it's okay.

564
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,521
[SPEAKER_28]: And like you typed a chat.

565
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,241
[SPEAKER_28]: You're like, oh, it's okay.

566
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:06,262
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations.

567
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:07,382
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad you won it.

568
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:10,183
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm like, he's fucking sitting there fucking throwing a fit.

569
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:12,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Like these probably like pillows are getting thrown in his place right now.

570
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:13,764
[SPEAKER_14]: God damn it.

571
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:17,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do we even fucking do these raves?

572
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:18,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

573
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:20,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Hope that drop was worth it when I push you down the stairs next time I see you.

574
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:28,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Anger Management, DarkSakura any moment in gaming where you've just gotten so angry you wanted to break something?

575
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:33,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Playing Dan in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, I just wanted to take the controller and embed it firmly into his skull.

576
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:38,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Because see, Dan, back in the day, and he's still like this to a degree, but not nearly as bad as he used to be.

577
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Dan likes to gloat.

578
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:45,750
[SPEAKER_18]: And likes to be alpha male, you know, big junk.

579
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,631
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't say.

580
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:49,934
[SPEAKER_18]: And back in the day, he had that problem even more.

581
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,697
[SPEAKER_18]: And so he would kick my ass soundly until I would play Cammy and Gambit.

582
00:45:55,698 --> 00:45:59,205
[SPEAKER_18]: and he would just, ha ha, ha ha, you know, he was Nelson.

583
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:03,813
[SPEAKER_18]: But he would be really dickly about it and finally I'm like, I'm just gonna beat you with this controller.

584
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,498
[SPEAKER_28]: I beat Alan with my shoe last night.

585
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:07,970
[SPEAKER_18]: How was it, Alan?

586
00:46:09,011 --> 00:46:09,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Was it hot?

587
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:10,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me tell you about this in a minute, actually.

588
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:12,213
[SPEAKER_28]: Because we have a call.

589
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:14,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, who uses a shoe?

590
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:16,575
[SPEAKER_28]: Caller, you're on the air.

591
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:17,155
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, who's this?

592
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:19,236
[SPEAKER_24]: I have been derailed.

593
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,738
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys just derailed me with the talk about their shoe.

594
00:46:22,038 --> 00:46:24,819
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the third time you've called in tonight, but that's okay.

595
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:25,340
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind?

596
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,941
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, you must be tired of me calling all the damn time.

597
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:28,441
[SPEAKER_28]: It's all right.

598
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:28,922
[SPEAKER_28]: It's all good.

599
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:29,382
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind?

600
00:46:30,703 --> 00:46:36,606
[SPEAKER_24]: I have an interesting Xbox Live story, which in turn, I end up getting two months free service out of them.

601
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:38,246
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, how'd this work?

602
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:42,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I always buy the cards to reload my subscription.

603
00:46:43,448 --> 00:46:49,211
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a rarity that I actually log in with my credit card, give them my information to re-up me for a month or two.

604
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:54,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, the last time this happened, they started automatically debiting my card, and I'm like, no, don't do that.

605
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:57,675
[SPEAKER_24]: And I set it to make sure that it would not do that.

606
00:46:58,035 --> 00:46:58,295
[SPEAKER_24]: So...

607
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,257
[SPEAKER_24]: I figured I'd go back to the cards and refill.

608
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:08,041
[SPEAKER_24]: They had that $1 special, so I'm like, you know what?

609
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:09,722
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to sign up for that.

610
00:47:09,822 --> 00:47:15,486
[SPEAKER_24]: So I signed up for about two months of service, and then I went out and got another card.

611
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:20,270
[SPEAKER_24]: And I get an email from them saying that they were unable to bill my card because the card was invalid.

612
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,873
[SPEAKER_24]: So I shrug it off like, no big deal.

613
00:47:23,953 --> 00:47:29,057
[SPEAKER_24]: You would think that they would see that in the system I automatically re-upped my account for another year.

614
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Every two, three weeks I would get an email about that.

615
00:47:34,338 --> 00:47:40,064
[SPEAKER_24]: Then one week in July, I figured I'd jump on, buy or something on Netflix.

616
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:44,028
[SPEAKER_24]: I go in and it says that my account is back to silver.

617
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:46,491
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm like, what the hell is going on?

618
00:47:47,312 --> 00:47:48,253
[SPEAKER_24]: I call them up.

619
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:51,864
[SPEAKER_24]: asking them why did they cancel my account.

620
00:47:51,924 --> 00:47:55,046
[SPEAKER_24]: And they said, I did not pay for it.

621
00:47:55,366 --> 00:48:00,950
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm explaining to them, if you see in the system, I purchased a one-year card.

622
00:48:01,471 --> 00:48:03,292
[SPEAKER_24]: So that makes no sense.

623
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:10,557
[SPEAKER_24]: So here I am screaming at the poor guy in India who in turn is like, the best thing I can do is get you a supervisor.

624
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:12,498
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm like, yeah, put him on.

625
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:14,400
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm explaining the whole situation.

626
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,321
[SPEAKER_24]: He's like, my hands are tied.

627
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:17,342
[SPEAKER_24]: There's nothing I can do.

628
00:48:17,992 --> 00:48:23,116
[SPEAKER_24]: At that point, I just drop a nuclear bomb because I'm just beyond aggravated about all of this.

629
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:28,941
[SPEAKER_24]: And he goes, well, what we can do, we can have a manager call you back within 48 hours.

630
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:29,922
[SPEAKER_24]: Fine.

631
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:30,563
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's my number.

632
00:48:30,863 --> 00:48:31,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Call me back in 48 hours.

633
00:48:33,185 --> 00:48:33,405
[SPEAKER_24]: Nope.

634
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:34,206
[SPEAKER_24]: Nothing.

635
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:35,827
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely nothing.

636
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,289
[SPEAKER_24]: So I go online.

637
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,012
[SPEAKER_28]: Wait, wait, wait.

638
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:41,953
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm misunderstanding.

639
00:48:41,993 --> 00:48:42,213
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

640
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,495
[SPEAKER_28]: They were set up to charge you automatically.

641
00:48:45,003 --> 00:48:46,044
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I canceled that.

642
00:48:46,284 --> 00:48:48,385
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, you canceled that, but they tried to do it anyway.

643
00:48:48,966 --> 00:48:49,206
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

644
00:48:49,586 --> 00:48:51,567
[SPEAKER_28]: And then you used prepaid cards.

645
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:52,448
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

646
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:53,309
[SPEAKER_28]: And what were they doing?

647
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:59,693
[SPEAKER_28]: Were they adding it to the time in the past that you hadn't paid for where you were like, I don't want to use this or I'm still lost right now?

648
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:06,517
[SPEAKER_24]: What it was doing, the card was supposed to kick in after I paid for one month, which was in April.

649
00:49:07,038 --> 00:49:07,298
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

650
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:11,400
[SPEAKER_24]: So my live was supposed to go from May 2010 to May, I guess, May 2011 or April 2011.

651
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:11,661
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

652
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:11,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

653
00:49:14,977 --> 00:49:15,557
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

654
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:40,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Manager never called me back, so I go on to the consumers, find contacts from Microsoft.

655
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:45,593
[SPEAKER_24]: I sent an email to Steve Ballmer and somebody else in charge at Microsoft with Xbox Live.

656
00:49:45,974 --> 00:49:46,274
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice.

657
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Within two days, I get a call from the manager.

658
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:51,836
[SPEAKER_24]: I explain everything.

659
00:49:52,277 --> 00:49:55,478
[SPEAKER_24]: He profusely apologizes and goes into the system.

660
00:49:55,598 --> 00:49:59,240
[SPEAKER_24]: It seems that on the supervisor's end, they don't have access to billing.

661
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:02,357
[SPEAKER_28]: That's crazy.

662
00:50:02,437 --> 00:50:03,538
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, what's the point then?

663
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:06,761
[SPEAKER_28]: You'd think there ought to be somebody that can fix it, you know?

664
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:07,402
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just weird.

665
00:50:08,623 --> 00:50:09,524
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, very.

666
00:50:09,764 --> 00:50:13,187
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm like, I'm yelling at the guy, log into your system and fix it.

667
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,468
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, we don't have access to that.

668
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:16,730
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you not have access to, you know?

669
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:23,437
[SPEAKER_28]: Goldanthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelandry.com says, it's because of shit like this that I'm just going to stick to prepaid cards now.

670
00:50:25,097 --> 00:50:30,521
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't blame him, but you know, damn it, a dollar for a month is a good deal and you can't beat that.

671
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:32,923
[SPEAKER_28]: That is a very good deal.

672
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,624
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to say real quick?

673
00:50:35,645 --> 00:50:39,107
[SPEAKER_28]: Because we're going to get back to Angry Games and beating with shoes and stuff in a minute.

674
00:50:39,988 --> 00:50:49,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Long story short, the guy contacts me back, he cancelled my gold, sends me a new code, so now I'm good from July to like June of 2011.

675
00:50:50,055 --> 00:50:51,896
[SPEAKER_24]: So I end up getting like two extra months out of the deal.

676
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:52,997
[SPEAKER_28]: Must be nice.

677
00:50:53,942 --> 00:50:54,302
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

678
00:50:54,382 --> 00:50:58,426
[SPEAKER_28]: So in the moral of the story is yelling at the supervisor fixes the trick every time.

679
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:00,188
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm kidding.

680
00:51:00,228 --> 00:51:00,628
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kidding.

681
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:02,030
[SPEAKER_28]: I used to work in a call center.

682
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,231
[SPEAKER_28]: Please don't.

683
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:03,992
[SPEAKER_24]: I know.

684
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:05,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't yell at them.

685
00:51:05,193 --> 00:51:07,094
[SPEAKER_24]: If they can't help you, find me.

686
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:09,797
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll give you an email address of somebody that will take care of it for you.

687
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,598
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, exactly.

688
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,119
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

689
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,181
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, Ranma, I'm going to let you go for real.

690
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:15,022
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one, okay, buddy?

691
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:16,063
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, good.

692
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:16,804
[SPEAKER_28]: I need more vodka.

693
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:17,604
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, good luck.

694
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:17,905
[SPEAKER_28]: Have fun.

695
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,559
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, where were we?

696
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:21,860
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yes, Beating with Shoes.

697
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,680
[SPEAKER_28]: And Alan's like, I want to tell this story.

698
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:27,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so Rob does not parallel park.

699
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:29,102
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't.

700
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:35,183
[SPEAKER_14]: In San Francisco, near where I live, parking is more precious than platinum or gold.

701
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:41,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you see a space, especially if it's a rock star space right in front of where you're going, you park in it.

702
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:48,127
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, if you're used to parking lots and you can't parallel park, you just say fuck that and you keep going.

703
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:56,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So whenever Rob under extreme duress has to parallel park, I will basically tease the hell out of him for it because he usually will not try.

704
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:05,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And last night when we were going to his Rocky Horror performance, there were basically three blocks of parallel parking without cars.

705
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,362
[SPEAKER_14]: So he just had to like drive in and sort of scoot his car up to the edge.

706
00:52:09,223 --> 00:52:10,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, I don't know.

707
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:11,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you can handle it?

708
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:12,886
[SPEAKER_14]: It's parallel parking.

709
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:16,149
[SPEAKER_14]: So he takes his shoe off and starts whapping me with it.

710
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:20,552
[SPEAKER_28]: No, no, it was, I said, you better be quieter, I'm gonna beat you in my shoe.

711
00:52:21,113 --> 00:52:24,515
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I think I, like, hit the curb with parking.

712
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:29,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, see, and that's the thing, then finally he stops the car and he's like, oh wait, how far away from the curb am I?

713
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, there's no one here.

714
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:37,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, my original making fun of you still stands, and then he took his shoe off and he hit me with it.

715
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:39,688
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you deserved it.

716
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:40,989
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

717
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:43,151
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not one to advocate domestic violence, but, you know.

718
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:51,556
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, he gives me stink eye for making fun of his parallel parking and then he stops the car and we're like five feet away from the curb.

719
00:52:52,556 --> 00:52:53,256
[SPEAKER_14]: With no cars.

720
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:54,737
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't have to wiggle wiggle in at all.

721
00:52:54,877 --> 00:52:55,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Nope, not at all.

722
00:52:56,037 --> 00:52:56,237
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

723
00:52:56,737 --> 00:52:57,177
[SPEAKER_28]: Good times.

724
00:52:57,918 --> 00:52:59,798
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I agree with Brakeman in our chat room.

725
00:52:59,878 --> 00:53:00,998
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck parallel parking.

726
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:01,799
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree with that.

727
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,419
[SPEAKER_28]: And Misty says, fuck driving.

728
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,740
[SPEAKER_28]: That's your attitude, right?

729
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,420
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that's where I'm at.

730
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,261
[SPEAKER_28]: What is it about driving that you're just not going to do it?

731
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:16,636
[SPEAKER_14]: The expense in, you know, car payment, gas insurance.

732
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:19,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone gets drunk and hits you, you're dead.

733
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,558
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's just, it's awful.

734
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:27,559
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's really nice, like, being able to go wherever you want, whenever you want.

735
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,800
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, that's really, you don't have to rely on really anyone else.

736
00:53:31,104 --> 00:53:31,524
[SPEAKER_28]: Just saying.

737
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:34,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the internet at home.

738
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:35,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to go anywhere.

739
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:36,828
[SPEAKER_14]: What about food?

740
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:38,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazon will ship it to my house.

741
00:53:38,169 --> 00:53:42,952
[SPEAKER_28]: What about if it's like, oh my god, I need some pink berry right now or I'm going to kill somebody.

742
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:43,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I went there.

743
00:53:44,373 --> 00:53:44,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard.

744
00:53:44,673 --> 00:53:45,094
[SPEAKER_17]: And they played ABBA.

745
00:53:45,114 --> 00:53:46,134
[SPEAKER_17]: How was it?

746
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:46,615
[SPEAKER_14]: It was awesome.

747
00:53:47,255 --> 00:53:48,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't it amazing?

748
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:48,896
[SPEAKER_14]: So good.

749
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:54,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I had the chocolate with the hazelnut crunch stuff on it and I wanted to die.

750
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,281
[SPEAKER_18]: It was good.

751
00:53:55,841 --> 00:53:56,742
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been telling you.

752
00:53:56,962 --> 00:53:57,382
[SPEAKER_28]: It's amazing.

753
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:58,583
[SPEAKER_18]: And I love the way that place is designed.

754
00:53:58,936 --> 00:53:59,296
[SPEAKER_28]: It's cute.

755
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:00,537
[SPEAKER_28]: Very cute little place.

756
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:01,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, it's a derail.

757
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,459
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's okay.

758
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,282
[SPEAKER_28]: Misty in chat says, it's a combo of the expense, the idiots on the road, and my failed attention span.

759
00:54:09,403 --> 00:54:11,004
[SPEAKER_28]: Long drives can be tough.

760
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:13,646
[SPEAKER_28]: Sometimes I'm like, oh, I want to take a really long drive.

761
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:23,953
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go drive across country, or I'll drive, I'll do something crazy like go drive to Kansas and visit Shane because it's halfway across the country, or I'll drive up to Canada, like Vancouver or something.

762
00:54:24,313 --> 00:54:25,794
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I'm like, oh, God.

763
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,095
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura.com

764
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:58,892
[SPEAKER_18]: We drove to Poster, Washington.

765
00:54:58,912 --> 00:54:59,893
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty much just as far.

766
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:03,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I think last year we did.

767
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:04,359
[SPEAKER_28]: Drive up there is great.

768
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:05,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Dan drove.

769
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:06,002
[SPEAKER_18]: I slept.

770
00:55:07,123 --> 00:55:08,805
[SPEAKER_18]: He would stop me on the way back for snow.

771
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:10,687
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, yeah.

772
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:42,798
[SPEAKER_28]: I love that that's your response.

773
00:55:43,998 --> 00:55:45,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was me.

774
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:58,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

775
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:18,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I know one of them has, the shoulder button has like a magnet in it.

776
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hit it wrong, it'll detach the magnet.

777
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:24,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't, if you, because it works with a magnet somehow.

778
00:56:25,503 --> 00:56:28,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it's not attached in the right place, it won't work.

779
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:29,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, for that.

780
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:37,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the last week when I was playing Burnout Revenge, any time I was like screwing up a bunch, I would get a screaming going.

781
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go, oh, fuck you, god damn it.

782
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:50,897
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so funny how Nintendo, like, puts out this, like, very family-friendly system, you know, and it's like, oh, you know, oh, we have to use friend codes so that children don't hear naughty language and da-da-da.

783
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:57,942
[SPEAKER_28]: But I remember back in the day in college playing Super Mario Kart in the dorms, and we would say the filthiest shit while playing that game.

784
00:56:58,022 --> 00:57:07,628
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, you know, talking about each other, our mothers, you know, sex stuff, and just all this stuff while playing, you know, Mario Kart.

785
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:08,248
[SPEAKER_28]: It got ugly.

786
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:09,088
[SPEAKER_28]: Very ugly.

787
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:12,751
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's not my fault I whoop them all with Toad because he's the best.

788
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:13,191
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

789
00:57:16,653 --> 00:57:17,853
[SPEAKER_28]: Those are cars you will drive.

790
00:57:18,294 --> 00:57:19,074
[SPEAKER_28]: Go-karts, right?

791
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:21,996
[SPEAKER_28]: Would you drive like a real go-kart?

792
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:23,857
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm 6'5".

793
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:24,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Could I fit in one?

794
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:28,019
[SPEAKER_28]: When we go to Disneyland, will you ride Autotopia?

795
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

796
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:36,813
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my god, then I could take a picture of you driving and be all like, hell froze over, lol.

797
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:40,634
[SPEAKER_28]: You're like, this isn't funny, I want to change the topic.

798
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,997
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, Breakman in chat says, long drives are fine as long as your wife or girlfriend sleeps.

799
00:57:49,818 --> 00:57:50,178
[SPEAKER_28]: Lol.

800
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,999
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, my girlfriend just keeps telling me how bad of a driver I am.

801
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,359
[SPEAKER_28]: Bitch, I know I'm a bad driver.

802
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:56,680
[SPEAKER_28]: Close your eyes, you won't notice.

803
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:00,291
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice.

804
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:01,952
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, hey, the phone's ringing.

805
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:02,573
[SPEAKER_28]: Why don't we answer it?

806
00:58:03,554 --> 00:58:04,554
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

807
00:58:04,574 --> 00:58:04,935
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

808
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:07,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Aseo again.

809
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:09,118
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, what's on your mind, Aseo?

810
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I was hoping to talk about Infamous 2.

811
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:16,763
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, okay.

812
00:58:17,224 --> 00:58:17,584
[SPEAKER_28]: What's up?

813
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,665
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think of Infamous 2?

814
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:21,887
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell us a little bit about it for those that don't know what Infamous is all about.

815
00:58:24,249 --> 00:58:28,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I haven't actually played the game, so I don't really know a whole lot about the story, but...

816
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:56,408
[SPEAKER_08]: apparently some world ending thing or whatever disaster strikes and here appears by the name of Cole and he has electrical powers now what I want to talk about the second one is how are they going to integrate the ice abilities into the gameplay mechanics because from what I played on the

817
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:10,274
[SPEAKER_08]: What I played on the demo for the first one, everything just kind of melded together for the electrical abilities, so I'm just wondering how that would work.

818
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Unfortunately, it's not a series I'm on the up and up on.

819
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:17,936
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki's kind of the expert about those, and he's not here, so I don't know.

820
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:22,497
[SPEAKER_28]: Is Infamous a series you've read up on at all, Alan, Jamie, anybody?

821
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:23,577
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know much about this.

822
00:59:23,718 --> 00:59:24,898
[SPEAKER_28]: I bought it, but I haven't played it.

823
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:25,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, really?

824
00:59:25,998 --> 00:59:27,339
[SPEAKER_28]: At least somebody has used it.

825
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,779
[SPEAKER_18]: What series?

826
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:28,639
[SPEAKER_28]: Infamous.

827
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:31,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, um, no.

828
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,836
[SPEAKER_28]: We're so informed here at Orange Lounge Radio.

829
00:59:35,856 --> 00:59:36,497
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome.

830
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:37,797
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we don't have time to play everything.

831
00:59:37,817 --> 00:59:38,238
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

832
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:43,601
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't play anything right now because Dan's playing the game that shan't be named.

833
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:43,881
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

834
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:44,822
[SPEAKER_28]: They've been playing that all night.

835
00:59:44,842 --> 00:59:45,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I was thinking about playing Sims.

836
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:50,065
[SPEAKER_28]: As long as we have been doing this marathon, they have been playing the game we can't name.

837
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:50,425
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

838
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:53,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, it shall not be named.

839
00:59:54,212 --> 00:59:54,472
[SPEAKER_28]: Name it.

840
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:54,732
[SPEAKER_28]: It's violent.

841
00:59:54,752 --> 00:59:55,493
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there a reason why?

842
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:56,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it's not out yet.

843
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:56,934
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh.

844
00:59:56,954 --> 00:59:58,075
[SPEAKER_28]: He's playing Imagine Single Lady.

845
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:58,175
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

846
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:23,677
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't tell you what we were playing.

847
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:24,238
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know nothing.

848
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,441
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know nothing, you savages.

849
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:52,761
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been about an hour.

850
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:53,842
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys want to take a quick break here?

851
01:00:54,142 --> 01:00:54,642
[SPEAKER_28]: Take a stretch?

852
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:55,423
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to get more water.

853
01:00:55,703 --> 01:00:57,624
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to take a potty stretch break.

854
01:00:57,684 --> 01:00:58,084
[SPEAKER_28]: Come back.

855
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:00,225
[SPEAKER_28]: We got some more topics we got through Facebook.

856
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:02,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Twitter topics galore we still have to do.

857
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:03,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, you have to do the theme.

858
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:04,607
[SPEAKER_28]: What theme?

859
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:07,774
[SPEAKER_18]: The Pala Pala Parapara thing.

860
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,114
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I didn't have time to set it up.

861
01:01:09,154 --> 01:01:09,514
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

862
01:01:09,754 --> 01:01:10,274
[SPEAKER_28]: I forgot.

863
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,955
[SPEAKER_28]: I've just put everything on shuffle.

864
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:15,416
[SPEAKER_28]: So maybe you'll get the... I know you like this song.

865
01:01:15,436 --> 01:01:16,936
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll do this song.

866
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:17,336
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

867
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:17,756
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll like this.

868
01:01:18,236 --> 01:01:22,778
[SPEAKER_28]: And so we'll be back with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon as we enter into hour eight in just a moment.

869
01:01:22,818 --> 01:01:28,039
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon, your tweets, so forth and so on.

870
01:01:34,443 --> 01:01:35,104
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio

871
01:01:47,779 --> 01:01:48,820
[SPEAKER_28]: of our marathon.

872
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,841
[SPEAKER_28]: We started at two and it's now ten.

873
01:01:52,302 --> 01:01:52,762
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't believe it.

874
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:58,887
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, and it probably doesn't turn out that long on the podcast because we have been taking musical breaks, which some people might consider cheating, but you know what?

875
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:01,388
[SPEAKER_28]: We gotta go to the bathroom at some point.

876
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:02,089
[SPEAKER_28]: We gotta eat.

877
01:02:02,129 --> 01:02:03,890
[SPEAKER_28]: We gotta, you know, just get up and stretch.

878
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,811
[SPEAKER_28]: This room gets kind of stuffy too, so, you know.

879
01:02:06,772 --> 01:02:07,652
[SPEAKER_28]: That's just how it works.

880
01:02:07,672 --> 01:02:09,073
[SPEAKER_28]: If you don't like it, too bad.

881
01:02:09,294 --> 01:02:10,674
[SPEAKER_28]: The show's free, for God's sake.

882
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,436
[SPEAKER_28]: Stop complaining about free things.

883
01:02:12,956 --> 01:02:13,416
[SPEAKER_28]: You suck.

884
01:02:13,556 --> 01:02:13,736
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

885
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:13,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

886
01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:23,383
[SPEAKER_28]: I should say though, if you want to support free things, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or tell a couple people about the show.

887
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:24,444
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what we always ask.

888
01:02:24,484 --> 01:02:26,585
[SPEAKER_28]: Just tell some friends and all that good stuff.

889
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:27,126
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all we want.

890
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:28,467
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

891
01:02:29,468 --> 01:02:31,109
[SPEAKER_28]: Chat's asking about chat FUs.

892
01:02:31,149 --> 01:02:32,229
[SPEAKER_28]: Can we do some chat FUs?

893
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to read some of those?

894
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

895
01:02:34,311 --> 01:02:36,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead and send them and I'll read them in about 30 minutes.

896
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:37,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Sound good?

897
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:38,711
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

898
01:02:53,243 --> 01:03:05,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Meanwhile, Twitter, we never got around to doing the tweets that were sent us in the last segment because I asked for some tweets and we got on tangents talking about Angry Games and the callers that we had and all that good stuff.

899
01:03:06,007 --> 01:03:10,009
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to try to get to some tweets.

900
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,369
[SPEAKER_28]: But I don't have the Twitter music.

901
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,070
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't do tweets without the Twitter music.

902
01:03:16,971 --> 01:03:17,451
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my gosh.

903
01:03:17,972 --> 01:03:19,032
[SPEAKER_28]: I ruined everything.

904
01:03:19,272 --> 01:03:20,232
[SPEAKER_28]: We have to stop the marathon.

905
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:20,592
[SPEAKER_28]: It's done.

906
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:21,453
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

907
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:24,177
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kidding.

908
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:28,160
[SPEAKER_14]: When you were out getting pizza, I deleted all of the native OLR music files.

909
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:28,961
[SPEAKER_14]: They're gone.

910
01:03:29,261 --> 01:03:29,982
[SPEAKER_28]: You jerk.

911
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:31,943
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, I found it.

912
01:03:43,271 --> 01:03:50,652
[SPEAKER_28]: We love our Twitter, O-L-R-E-D To KRA saying, how is the Final Fantasy XIV beta?

913
01:03:50,773 --> 01:03:52,593
[SPEAKER_28]: Isn't it just a prettier FFXI?

914
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,273
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, pretty much.

915
01:03:54,573 --> 01:03:58,914
[SPEAKER_28]: It's FFXI with different combat and this whole guild leps thing that makes no sense to me whatsoever.

916
01:03:59,594 --> 01:04:02,795
[SPEAKER_28]: The biggest problem with Final Fantasy XI is that it doesn't handhold you at all.

917
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,956
[SPEAKER_28]: And like, I agree, some games overdo it with the handholding.

918
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,656
[SPEAKER_28]: But what was the most frustrating thing about Final Fantasy XI?

919
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:11,977
[SPEAKER_28]: The fact that it just plunks you in the middle of a town and was like, okay, bye.

920
01:04:11,997 --> 01:04:12,417
[SPEAKER_18]: The people.

921
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:12,817
[SPEAKER_18]: The people.

922
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,357
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

923
01:04:15,877 --> 01:04:18,940
[SPEAKER_28]: So Final Fantasy XIV, the beta is really crowded.

924
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:20,802
[SPEAKER_28]: I couldn't figure out what to do.

925
01:04:21,342 --> 01:04:26,627
[SPEAKER_28]: I couldn't figure out that there was a whole other map level I was supposed to go to and activate a switch.

926
01:04:27,227 --> 01:04:35,175
[SPEAKER_28]: You would think the game would lead you through the first couple quests just to kind of give you a tutorial about how the game works, the interface, you know?

927
01:04:35,695 --> 01:05:01,206
[SPEAKER_28]: maybe it's because it's a beta not all of that's built in yet but I just the beta left me feeling very frustrated and that's why I'm kind of laughing at all this like closed betas or the open beta stuff going on is I'm like guys it's not worth your time okay but hey it's a free game and at least you'll know if you can uh buy it when it comes out or not but I honestly think the game is going to tank I think it's going to tank bad especially for a Final Fantasy game like I think they're expecting it to do really well it's not going to do nearly the business 13 did

928
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:04,485
[SPEAKER_28]: But we'll see.

929
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:09,548
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Blaziken sent us several tweets.

930
01:05:09,728 --> 01:05:12,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Usually I limit people to two tweets, but hey, it's the marathon.

931
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:12,670
[SPEAKER_28]: Why not?

932
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,972
[SPEAKER_28]: So DJ Blaziken says, What's cuter than a cat playing Duck Hunt?

933
01:05:17,753 --> 01:05:18,633
[SPEAKER_28]: Nothing!

934
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:22,555
[SPEAKER_28]: And sends us this tweet, or sorry, article via Twitter.

935
01:05:22,575 --> 01:05:23,656
[SPEAKER_28]: And I actually did see this.

936
01:05:24,116 --> 01:05:27,438
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a video on YouTube of a kitty who's actually playing Duck Hunt.

937
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:29,459
[SPEAKER_28]: And they start the game there.

938
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,006
[SPEAKER_28]: And then the kid, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.

939
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:36,567
[SPEAKER_28]: And the cat, see the cat's like scratching the dog with her paws.

940
01:05:40,028 --> 01:05:42,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Like attacking the ducks even though they fly off screen.

941
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:42,849
[SPEAKER_28]: It's adorable.

942
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:46,170
[SPEAKER_27]: Tell me that's not adorable.

943
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:47,530
[SPEAKER_28]: It's adorable.

944
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:52,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Cats are so damn cute.

945
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:52,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

946
01:05:53,598 --> 01:05:56,380
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Blaziken says, don't bother watching football this season.

947
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,880
[SPEAKER_28]: Madden 11 already picked all the winners.

948
01:05:58,681 --> 01:06:06,125
[SPEAKER_28]: And linked us to a news story about how I guess all the winners are already, it's been determined because, you know, there's all the statistics in Madden and everything.

949
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,847
[SPEAKER_28]: The Ravens and Packers will be the conference winners.

950
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:11,088
[SPEAKER_28]: So there it is.

951
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:13,549
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just, I, LOL Super Bowl spoilers.

952
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:20,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the football star that actually is on the cover of Madden has the Madden curse.

953
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:28,009
[SPEAKER_14]: So like if you're the guy who's on the box art, they have a horrible season after the game comes out.

954
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,670
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's like a thing.

955
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:30,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

956
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,611
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't follow the ball.

957
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:31,731
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.

958
01:06:31,771 --> 01:06:32,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard the same thing.

959
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:34,872
[SPEAKER_28]: They always get injured or something happens.

960
01:06:36,232 --> 01:06:37,173
[SPEAKER_28]: Who was on the cover this year?

961
01:06:37,473 --> 01:06:38,213
[SPEAKER_28]: I wasn't paying attention.

962
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,211
[SPEAKER_28]: Was it Brett Favre?

963
01:06:41,391 --> 01:06:42,071
[SPEAKER_28]: People like him.

964
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:43,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Tiger Woods.

965
01:06:45,774 --> 01:06:46,395
[SPEAKER_14]: David Beckham.

966
01:06:47,075 --> 01:06:48,056
[SPEAKER_14]: That's football, right?

967
01:06:48,076 --> 01:06:48,596
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, that's right.

968
01:06:48,616 --> 01:06:49,257
[SPEAKER_28]: It's David Beckham.

969
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:49,917
[SPEAKER_28]: It is.

970
01:06:51,218 --> 01:06:51,598
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

971
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,380
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

972
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,923
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Blaze can send us a story that we talked about in the very first hour of the marathon.

973
01:06:57,943 --> 01:07:01,386
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm just going to assume you didn't hear it about Microsoft raising the price of Xbox Live Gold.

974
01:07:01,786 --> 01:07:03,247
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll just pretend that I didn't get that tweet.

975
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:08,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Apparently Super Scribblenauts is there.

976
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:12,272
[SPEAKER_28]: There's an announcement about Super Scribblenauts or whatever.

977
01:07:12,632 --> 01:07:12,972
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

978
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:16,293
[SPEAKER_28]: Red Entertainment is linking us to this story on Twitter at Mega64.

979
01:07:16,373 --> 01:07:21,095
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess they're excited because they're in the game.

980
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:28,397
[SPEAKER_28]: They're actually in the game, I guess.

981
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:31,491
[SPEAKER_28]: Good for them.

982
01:07:33,593 --> 01:07:34,313
[SPEAKER_28]: Whoopty shit.

983
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:35,193
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, whatever.

984
01:07:56,565 --> 01:07:57,546
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you know who I am?

985
01:07:58,687 --> 01:08:01,169
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I don't expect people to know who I am.

986
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:03,731
[SPEAKER_28]: But yay to them getting in a game, I guess.

987
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:06,874
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess now I won't be able to get away from it.

988
01:08:06,974 --> 01:08:07,855
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll have to know who they are.

989
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:14,778
[SPEAKER_28]: It was... I don't know if I should say this because this is getting back to... I won't go into it any further.

990
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:15,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Allegedly.

991
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:16,399
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

992
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,440
[SPEAKER_28]: The word allegedly will always say it over and over again.

993
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:18,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, come on.

994
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:19,900
[SPEAKER_28]: This is an alleged story.

995
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,081
[SPEAKER_28]: It's all allegedly.

996
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:24,182
[SPEAKER_28]: Allegedly, it was a large man with glasses.

997
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:25,082
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all I'm going to say.

998
01:08:25,162 --> 01:08:25,443
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

999
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:28,404
[SPEAKER_28]: But I think that's all of them, isn't it?

1000
01:08:29,124 --> 01:08:32,586
[SPEAKER_28]: I think in that video they were all large men with glasses, weren't they?

1001
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:35,668
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think that tells you anything.

1002
01:08:35,688 --> 01:08:38,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, large men in IT and software development.

1003
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:39,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1004
01:08:39,611 --> 01:08:40,612
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a unicorn.

1005
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:41,673
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1006
01:08:42,173 --> 01:08:43,414
[SPEAKER_28]: But yay for Super Scribblenauts.

1007
01:08:43,454 --> 01:08:44,075
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that's great.

1008
01:08:45,396 --> 01:08:48,498
[SPEAKER_28]: Sony is going to be rolling out Arrival to iTunes, apparently.

1009
01:08:48,518 --> 01:08:50,320
[SPEAKER_28]: Didn't Loki bring this up earlier in the show?

1010
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,441
[SPEAKER_28]: I think he did.

1011
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:54,101
[SPEAKER_28]: Shout out!

1012
01:08:54,121 --> 01:08:54,182
[SPEAKER_28]: Woo!

1013
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,231
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's see, moving on.

1014
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:20,473
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkTetsuya says, I know this is a more local question, but will the Golfland slash Dave and Buster meetup still happen sometime soon?

1015
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:22,694
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been happening.

1016
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:26,195
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, well there wasn't one this past week.

1017
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:29,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Well no, because Dan and I were saving money and time for our anniversary.

1018
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:31,917
[SPEAKER_18]: But they've been happening.

1019
01:09:33,577 --> 01:09:34,798
[SPEAKER_28]: History will repeat itself.

1020
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:36,318
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

1021
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:38,239
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, it'll happen again, of course.

1022
01:09:40,062 --> 01:09:40,803
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, let's see.

1023
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:46,427
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, Jeju Go on chat says, uh, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1024
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,409
[SPEAKER_28]: Possible, impromptu, listless?

1025
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:49,529
[SPEAKER_28]: Question mark.

1026
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:49,990
[SPEAKER_28]: Huh.

1027
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:52,852
[SPEAKER_28]: We do need to do a listless at some point before the marathon's over.

1028
01:09:53,092 --> 01:09:55,033
[SPEAKER_18]: How about during the next break we write up stuff?

1029
01:09:55,253 --> 01:09:59,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we'll write that in a match game during the next break and then we'll have something to play for real, so that'll be cool.

1030
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:04,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, Amay Satsuma says, what kind of pre-order bonus do you want to see in Duke Nukem Forever?

1031
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:07,419
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to see a Duke Nukem Forever urinal cake.

1032
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:09,840
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that would be quite classy.

1033
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't you think that would be very classy?

1034
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:12,981
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, I think it's classy.

1035
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:17,582
[SPEAKER_28]: Anybody here in the studio, what kind of pre-order bonus do you want to see for Duke Nukem Forever?

1036
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:20,823
[SPEAKER_28]: How about Duke Nukem Forever pasties for your stripper friends?

1037
01:10:20,903 --> 01:10:21,664
[SPEAKER_28]: That would be good, right?

1038
01:10:23,424 --> 01:10:23,744
[SPEAKER_28]: Anybody?

1039
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:25,265
[SPEAKER_18]: I want the stripper pole.

1040
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:26,665
[SPEAKER_28]: You want the stripper pole?

1041
01:10:27,345 --> 01:10:28,546
[SPEAKER_18]: I want the pole and a gun.

1042
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:29,226
[SPEAKER_28]: Huh?

1043
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:31,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, anything?

1044
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:32,307
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1045
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:35,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice.

1046
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:37,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's see.

1047
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:39,291
[SPEAKER_28]: Other tweets at OLR.

1048
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:43,513
[SPEAKER_28]: Breakman says on Twitter, What are the OLR drinking games?

1049
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:44,393
[SPEAKER_28]: What are the rules?

1050
01:10:44,493 --> 01:10:45,854
[SPEAKER_28]: Can the chatters play together?

1051
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:47,095
[SPEAKER_28]: I use any excuse.

1052
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:49,616
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, drink anytime one of us says um.

1053
01:10:50,156 --> 01:10:52,798
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll be floored in like a minute.

1054
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:55,072
[SPEAKER_28]: No, uh, oopsie drink.

1055
01:10:57,114 --> 01:11:04,342
[SPEAKER_28]: I think there is a drinking game compiled on the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wikia.com.

1056
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:07,166
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to say there is a drinking game compiled there.

1057
01:11:08,547 --> 01:11:12,632
[SPEAKER_28]: And it combines some stuff with Under Sedation Live, if you listen to that show.

1058
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:13,373
[SPEAKER_28]: Although, I don't know.

1059
01:11:14,774 --> 01:11:42,134
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm looking at Twitter and there's a tweet from Travis earlier six hours ago so that was during the main show actually heard something on OLR that made me angry and dislike the show and that is something that never happened before okay he's so theatrical I love Travis but just say what it is or I mean I don't know what else to say sorry Travis sorry we ruffled your feathers alright anyhow

1060
01:11:43,755 --> 01:11:44,475
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it for Twitter.

1061
01:11:44,515 --> 01:11:47,096
[SPEAKER_28]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.

1062
01:11:48,456 --> 01:11:49,056
[SPEAKER_28]: That would be fun.

1063
01:11:51,097 --> 01:11:51,537
[SPEAKER_28]: Now what?

1064
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:52,537
[SPEAKER_28]: What are we talking about now?

1065
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:53,497
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, chat FUs.

1066
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Do we have chat FUs?

1067
01:11:55,038 --> 01:11:55,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Just about.

1068
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:56,698
[SPEAKER_28]: Sufficient chat angst?

1069
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,399
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you mean just about?

1070
01:11:59,059 --> 01:11:59,939
[SPEAKER_28]: Either you do or you don't.

1071
01:12:00,059 --> 01:12:00,519
[SPEAKER_18]: You do.

1072
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:01,239
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, good.

1073
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:06,961
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, let's get to the angsty music and we'll do some chat FUs right now.

1074
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:21,948
[SPEAKER_18]: First one comes from Toygak.

1075
01:12:22,608 --> 01:12:24,010
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to being East Coast.

[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1081
01:12:30,937 --> 01:12:34,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop Drinkle holding Pepsi throwback even though it's in limited edition.

1082
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:35,702
[SPEAKER_18]: It's still hard to find.

1083
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:39,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Add to snatch the last 12 pack of throwback out of someone's cart.

1084
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Step it up, Pepsi.

1085
01:12:41,388 --> 01:12:42,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, it's everywhere here, really.

1086
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:48,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Weiland, F you to this ear infection and the hearing loss that's gone with it.

[SPEAKER_18]: Owen, F you to that one guy.

1088
01:12:50,724 --> 01:12:53,286
[SPEAKER_18]: The one guy that did that stuff back then at that place.

1089
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:58,650
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkTetia, fuck having to wake up early to fly home tomorrow.

[SPEAKER_18]: F you to faux holidays.

1094
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:09,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1095
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:11,941
[SPEAKER_18]: You know in some places they work six days a week.

1096
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:27,013
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkCircuitry, F you to annoying little fucking kids who jump up on the 2P pad while you're playing a particularly difficult doubles chart in, insert dance game of choice here, thereby either ruining your score, distracting you, or causing you to fail out entirely, or fall out entirely.

1097
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,741
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Dollar, FU on two parts.

1098
01:13:33,162 --> 01:13:35,583
[SPEAKER_18]: One for someone on IRC who actually has my name.

1099
01:13:36,024 --> 01:13:37,965
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the fucking original, damn it.

1100
01:13:38,946 --> 01:13:45,750
[SPEAKER_18]: And two for the Call of Duty Black Ops developers who are trying to get people like me to play more multiplayer.

1101
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:46,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck that.

[SPEAKER_18]: Final Fantasy VII, FU to the bad effects.

1103

[SPEAKER_18]: Hours later from eating extremely hot slash spicy food.

1104
01:13:55,797 --> 01:13:57,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Feeling like you're giving birth to lava blows.

1105
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:00,306
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

1106
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:01,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Eat more crackers.

1107
01:14:01,346 --> 01:14:01,746
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll help.

1108
01:14:03,087 --> 01:14:04,447

[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're right, though.

1127
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,901
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm almost positive there was.

1128
01:17:13,222 --> 01:17:14,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you actually play that through to completion?

1129
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:19,924
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it true you can beat it with every combination of characters, or no, you can't do it with all of them?

1130
01:17:20,524 --> 01:17:31,907
[SPEAKER_14]: There are... I know that there are two or three characters that it's really preferred that you have at least one of them in there, but yeah, I think you can beat it with all, with any three.

[SPEAKER_28]: Wait, here you go, here you go.

01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:40,974
This is a live-action movie.

1134
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:44,435
Yeah, it was a live-action show.

1135
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:44,855
A TV show.

1136
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:46,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my gosh, I remember that.

1137
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:50,537
[SPEAKER_17]: It was almost like a drama, the way the credits make it look like, huh?

1138
01:17:50,577 --> 01:17:50,897
Yeah.

1139
01:18:02,202 --> 01:18:05,365

1141
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:16,354
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a scene out of Twin Peaks or something.

1142
01:18:27,455 --> 01:18:28,176
[SPEAKER_28]: This is creepy.

1143
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:28,937
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't like this.

1144
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:29,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1145
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:31,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is upsetting.

1146
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,041
[SPEAKER_28]: It's upsetting me.

1147
01:18:32,262 --> 01:18:33,543
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it ruining your memory of the show?

1148
01:18:33,563 --> 01:18:35,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Or is it ruining your memory of the game?

1149
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:38,050
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it making you like the game a little less?

1150
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:40,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it has nothing to do with the game, so... Alright.

1151
01:18:41,074 --> 01:18:44,018
[SPEAKER_28]: But it said in the credits, based on the Lucasfilm game, just so you know.

1152
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:48,978
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, save it for when you get home

1153
01:19:04,534 --> 01:19:06,055
[SPEAKER_18]: It was even mentioned during this show.

1154
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:06,495
[SPEAKER_18]: It was.

1155
01:19:06,515 --> 01:19:08,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Bob grabbed my copy and goes, Look!

1156
01:19:09,637 --> 01:19:10,217
[SPEAKER_28]: It's great.

1157
01:19:10,477 --> 01:19:10,957
[SPEAKER_28]: I love it.

1158
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:15,039
[SPEAKER_28]: And yet I haven't bought Metroid Other M because I'm afraid it's terrible.

1159
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:17,580
[SPEAKER_28]: I've heard from people it's great.

1160
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,962
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been hearing mixed things on it and I'm very worried.

1161
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,902
[SPEAKER_28]: And I have to hook up my Wii to play it.

1162
01:19:21,942 --> 01:19:23,543
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't want to hook up the Wii.

1163
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Solution.

1164
01:19:25,124 --> 01:19:25,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Netflix.

1165
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:26,965
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

1166
01:19:28,132 --> 01:19:29,133
[SPEAKER_18]: or Gamefly or whatever.

1167
01:19:29,213 --> 01:19:30,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I was like, Netflix?

1168
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:32,315
[SPEAKER_18]: You can get games through Netflix too.

1169
01:19:32,516 --> 01:19:41,943
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I could do the Netfly, the Gamefly thing, but that would involve me again getting the motivation to hook up the Wii to my TV and that means, you know.

1170
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:44,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, it takes 10 freaking minutes.

1171
01:19:45,145 --> 01:19:45,846
[SPEAKER_28]: Not in my house.

1172
01:19:45,966 --> 01:19:49,949
[SPEAKER_14]: You've had a Gamefly account since like March that's been rotting since March.

1173
01:19:50,009 --> 01:19:51,070
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't really ever use it.

1174
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:51,751
[SPEAKER_28]: It's kind of sad.

1175
01:19:53,112 --> 01:19:53,452
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1176
01:19:53,492 --> 01:19:54,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it worth it?

1177
01:19:54,052 --> 01:19:57,155
[SPEAKER_28]: Should I play Metroid Other M if I'm such a stan for Super Metroid?

1178
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:58,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Chat, vote, why in?

1179
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:02,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

1180
01:20:02,551 --> 01:20:06,174
[SPEAKER_28]: Breakman says watch FNG Friday Night Gaming or F-ing Live.

1181
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,295
[SPEAKER_28]: It's F-ing Live.

1182
01:20:07,996 --> 01:20:11,119
[SPEAKER_28]: Bobby's going to show Metroid Other M. Maybe I'll check that out.

1183
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:11,439
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

1184
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,561
[SPEAKER_28]: I might.

1185
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:15,883
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

1186
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley, time's up.

1187
01:20:18,065 --> 01:20:18,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you think of something?

1188
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:22,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd probably go with Panzer Dragoon Saga.

1189
01:20:22,268 --> 01:20:24,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really epic game.

1190
01:20:24,769 --> 01:20:29,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one game when the first time I saw the battle system, I got, whoa, that's awesome.

1191
01:20:30,253 --> 01:20:43,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's such a different system and seeing that you're flying right next to the enemies that you're fighting, it's like, oh, this is really, really, really neat because you're flying around them in a circle and then you attack based on that.

1192
01:20:45,996 --> 01:21:13,011
[SPEAKER_03]: and then just a really cool storyline and lots of things to explore and neat things never played it sadly I think I've played all the other games that have been mentioned but I've never played that for some sick reason I'm just not cool yeah well it was only a limited edition and all that kind of stuff it's definitely worth a play I want to say that only 6,000 copies were printed in the US when it came out wow no wonder it's so expensive

1193
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:18,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see some folks in chat about Metroid Other M. Yes, yes, yes, why, why?

1194
01:21:19,034 --> 01:21:20,875
[SPEAKER_28]: But then I got a private message that says it sucks.

1195
01:21:21,136 --> 01:21:24,298
[SPEAKER_28]: So maybe the people who think it sucks don't want to speak up.

1196
01:21:24,698 --> 01:21:25,919
[SPEAKER_28]: Frisbee says at least try it.

1197
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:27,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, there's Miklatov saying no.

1198
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:30,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, we got last minute FU.

1199
01:21:30,642 --> 01:21:33,323
[SPEAKER_28]: Ranma says someone get Sky some caffeine stat.

1200
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,266
[SPEAKER_28]: And Breakman says fuck caffeine, get him some more booze and a cot.

1201
01:21:39,207 --> 01:21:40,027
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there caffeine in that?

1202
01:21:40,327 --> 01:21:41,048
[SPEAKER_18]: It's real dark Pepsi.

1203
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,008
[SPEAKER_18]: You can finish it.

1204
01:21:42,508 --> 01:21:43,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I got the last one so you can have it.

1205
01:21:43,828 --> 01:21:45,509
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, what'd you have for you?

1206
01:21:45,829 --> 01:21:49,590
[SPEAKER_18]: From Marissa, F you to not seeing Rob and Jamie, heart, heart, heart, need to visit.

1207
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:50,911
[SPEAKER_18]: From Marissa.

1208
01:21:51,071 --> 01:21:51,871
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell her about Tron.

1209
01:21:52,231 --> 01:21:53,011
[SPEAKER_28]: She wasn't listening earlier.

1210
01:21:53,031 --> 01:21:53,391
[SPEAKER_18]: You can have it.

1211
01:21:54,132 --> 01:21:54,972
[SPEAKER_18]: You're giving it to me?

1212
01:21:55,092 --> 01:21:55,492
[SPEAKER_28]: I am.

1213
01:21:55,532 --> 01:21:56,352
[SPEAKER_28]: You're a nice lady.

1214
01:21:56,472 --> 01:21:56,893
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

1215
01:21:56,933 --> 01:21:57,373
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1216
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna have more beer.

1217
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:00,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you want some Pepsi?

1218
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,474
[SPEAKER_26]: Good, because I wasn't gonna give it to you.

1219
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:04,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1220
01:22:04,855 --> 01:22:07,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're planning on going to see Tron at Disneyland.

1221
01:22:09,628 --> 01:22:10,829
[SPEAKER_28]: But then your mic cut out.

1222
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:14,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Hint, hint, hint to people who work at Disneyland, let us in.

1223
01:22:15,012 --> 01:22:25,680
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, we're planning on going to see Tron and go to the big Tron party and then go have ourselves digitized so we can live in Tron world and then go play the Tron level in Kingdom Hearts 2.

1224
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:29,343
[SPEAKER_28]: And then, then we might find a life.

1225
01:22:29,363 --> 01:22:30,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Play that music.

1226
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:30,924
[SPEAKER_28]: What music?

1227
01:22:31,344 --> 01:22:35,927
[SPEAKER_28]: Didn't I give you the Tron music from... Oh, because I have it just right here sitting in front of me.

1228
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:37,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine, I'm going to email it to you.

1229
01:22:39,992 --> 01:22:40,953
[SPEAKER_28]: I just happen to have it.

1230
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:41,333
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

1231
01:22:41,613 --> 01:22:42,353
[SPEAKER_28]: Right here, Jamie.

1232
01:22:42,393 --> 01:22:43,194
[SPEAKER_28]: It's on the desktop.

1233
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:47,696
[SPEAKER_28]: I have it saved just for circumstances like this when Jamie's going to shout randomly.

1234
01:22:48,016 --> 01:22:48,396
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob!

1235
01:22:49,617 --> 01:22:51,017
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.

1236
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:56,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't you have that freaking... Whatever.

1237
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,040
[SPEAKER_28]: I just don't want this.

1238
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:00,862
[SPEAKER_14]: You're almost nine hours into the broadcast and tensions are finally... That's right.

1239
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,042
[SPEAKER_28]: Tensions are finally flaring.

1240
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:04,243
[SPEAKER_28]: I will vote you off this island.

1241
01:23:04,663 --> 01:23:06,824
[SPEAKER_28]: I will shove that Vuvuzela so far up your ass.

1242
01:23:07,885 --> 01:23:08,165
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1243
01:23:10,106 --> 01:23:10,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, stop!

1244
01:23:11,527 --> 01:23:11,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop!

1245
01:23:13,268 --> 01:23:13,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucker.

1246
01:23:14,388 --> 01:23:14,628
[SPEAKER_18]: There.

1247
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:17,930
[SPEAKER_28]: I just got a text message from my friend Nathan.

1248
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:22,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe it was a mistake to post about this on Facebook, because I think some of my real-life friends suddenly tune in.

1249
01:23:22,492 --> 01:23:23,473
[SPEAKER_28]: I post on my Facebook.

1250
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,534
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm on hour eight of my radio show.

1251
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:26,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Please help.

1252
01:23:26,494 --> 01:23:33,458
[SPEAKER_28]: No, but Nathan sent me a text saying, if you run out of stuff to talk about, there is always the D&D campaign I ran with you as the sassy black lady.

1253
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,060
[SPEAKER_28]: What's so funny?

1254
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,461
[SPEAKER_28]: We had fun.

1255
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:43,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I can just imagine you playing the sassy black lady.

1256
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:45,897
[SPEAKER_28]: Why is that?

1257
01:23:47,378 --> 01:23:52,960
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, because I've heard you do impressions of people and I could totally see you doing the sassy black lady.

1258
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:56,021
[SPEAKER_18]: You did pull off a good Jewish mother once.

1259
01:23:57,222 --> 01:23:57,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I know.

1260
01:23:58,642 --> 01:23:59,523
[SPEAKER_27]: It was funny.

1261
01:23:59,943 --> 01:24:03,144
[SPEAKER_27]: Rob, why aren't you picking up your phone?

1262
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:04,885
[SPEAKER_27]: You need to call your mother.

1263
01:24:05,585 --> 01:24:05,825
[SPEAKER_17]: See?

1264
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:07,926
[SPEAKER_18]: He does it really well.

1265
01:24:09,564 --> 01:24:17,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you cast like, oh hell no, and it has like a one day cooldown where you use it on like an orc and you couldn't cast it again for another day?

1266
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:20,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1267
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:21,910
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, something like that.

1268
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:30,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know, no, it's just like, you know, all these freaking elves and dwarf people up in here, like, you know, we need some, we need to represent.

1269
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:33,415
[SPEAKER_28]: So, good times.

1270
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:35,173
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

1271
01:24:35,273 --> 01:24:38,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Silent Nathan says he was the best noob player I've ever had.

1272
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:38,795
[SPEAKER_28]: I was awesome.

1273
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:40,175
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, this is the time.

1274
01:24:40,415 --> 01:24:41,836
[SPEAKER_28]: I've told you about the ex, right?

1275
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,817
[SPEAKER_28]: The one that just ruined everything.

1276
01:24:45,597 --> 01:24:47,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, no matter where you take him, he'd ruin it.

1277
01:24:47,918 --> 01:24:53,881
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, for some reason, I invited him to play D&D with us, and he was also a noob at this whole thing, and man, he just ruined it.

1278
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:59,243
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, you know, he'd be like, you know, you know, oh, I want to cast a spell.

1279
01:24:59,323 --> 01:25:00,063
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, it's in the book.

1280
01:25:00,123 --> 01:25:01,624
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to cast a spell in the book.

1281
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:03,205
Um...

1282
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:06,693
[SPEAKER_28]: He's like that.

1283
01:25:07,093 --> 01:25:08,355
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to show my titties.

1284
01:25:08,735 --> 01:25:10,397
[SPEAKER_28]: How do I show my titties?

1285
01:25:10,537 --> 01:25:15,303
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not lying.

1286
01:25:15,463 --> 01:25:16,224
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not lying.

1287
01:25:16,284 --> 01:25:17,606
[SPEAKER_28]: He was like that, allegedly.

1288
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:18,607
[SPEAKER_28]: He was like this.

1289
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:20,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Rob, I'm sending you something.

1290
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:23,833
[SPEAKER_18]: And you need to read the email on the air.

1291
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:25,074
[SPEAKER_28]: Why?

1292
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:26,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I just sent it to you.

1293
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:28,194
[SPEAKER_28]: to my personal email?

1294
01:25:28,234 --> 01:25:28,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1295
01:25:29,655 --> 01:25:31,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to roll a cleric, okay?

1296
01:25:31,616 --> 01:25:32,176
[SPEAKER_14]: What's its name?

1297
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:34,137
[SPEAKER_28]: He was a cleric!

1298
01:25:34,277 --> 01:25:38,739
[SPEAKER_28]: He was a priest in WoW, so he wanted to be a priest in whatever.

1299
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:40,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Pull up the Satan's Game.

1300
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:42,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Satan's Game?

1301
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,621
[SPEAKER_18]: On YouTube.

1302
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:46,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Dungeons and Dragons.

1303
01:25:47,402 --> 01:25:48,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Satan's Game.

1304
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:53,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you brought that up and it'll give us time for you to check your email.

1305
01:25:54,184 --> 01:25:55,485
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got like a million things I'm trying to do.

1306
01:25:57,004 --> 01:25:58,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you don't.

1307
01:25:58,325 --> 01:25:58,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe 100,000.

1308
01:25:58,605 --> 01:26:03,869
[SPEAKER_28]: I told Nathan to call in and talk about D&D, but he doesn't want to.

1309
01:26:04,009 --> 01:26:04,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Do it!

1310
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:07,192
[SPEAKER_28]: Satan's Game?

1311
01:26:07,352 --> 01:26:10,375
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1312
01:26:10,615 --> 01:26:11,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Should be Dungeons & Dragons.

1313
01:26:12,096 --> 01:26:13,397
[SPEAKER_28]: Dungeons & Dragons, Satan's Game.

1314
01:26:14,418 --> 01:26:15,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there you go.

1315
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:16,199
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1316
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:21,264
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that's it.

1317
01:26:23,664 --> 01:26:27,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years Dungeons and Dragons

1318
01:26:35,615 --> 01:26:36,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Satan's Game.

1319
01:26:37,676 --> 01:26:53,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.

1320
01:26:54,100 --> 01:27:00,521
[SPEAKER_21]: This afternoon, the Dead Alewives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.

1321
01:27:01,161 --> 01:27:03,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Observe the previously unobservable

1322
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:05,043
[SPEAKER_21]: What's with the extra music?

1323
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,065
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's not right.

1324
01:27:24,451 --> 01:27:25,632
[SPEAKER_27]: Go look it up on YouTube.

1325
01:27:25,692 --> 01:27:26,532
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be right there.

1326
01:27:26,552 --> 01:27:27,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Do the 8-bit theater one.

1327
01:27:27,273 --> 01:27:27,673
[SPEAKER_18]: It was right there.

1328
01:27:27,713 --> 01:27:28,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Dungeons and Dragons.

1329
01:27:28,714 --> 01:27:29,054
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

1330
01:27:29,074 --> 01:27:30,295
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to hear the opening.

1331
01:27:31,636 --> 01:27:37,459
[SPEAKER_21]: As a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons.

1332
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:42,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north.

1333
01:27:43,463 --> 01:27:46,625
[SPEAKER_13]: You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.

1334
01:27:47,165 --> 01:27:51,048
[SPEAKER_13]: The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.

1335
01:27:51,068 --> 01:27:51,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are they?

1336
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:53,812
[SPEAKER_13]: They're right next to you.

1337
01:27:54,133 --> 01:27:55,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I cast a spell!

1338
01:27:55,415 --> 01:27:56,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's the Mountain Dew?

1339
01:27:56,858 --> 01:27:58,321
[SPEAKER_13]: In the fridge, duh!

1340
01:27:58,482 --> 01:27:59,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanna cast a spell!

1341
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew, just go get it.

1342
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:05,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I can cast any of these, right?

1343
01:28:05,722 --> 01:28:06,202
[SPEAKER_13]: On the list?

1344
01:28:06,282 --> 01:28:08,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, any of the first level ones.

1345
01:28:08,564 --> 01:28:10,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna get a soda, anyone want one?

1346
01:28:11,005 --> 01:28:13,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Cram, I'm not in the room, right?

1347
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:14,246
[SPEAKER_13]: What room?

1348
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:17,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanna cast Magic Missile.

1349
01:28:17,088 --> 01:28:19,409
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanna point out, this is exactly, this is true.

1350
01:28:19,589 --> 01:28:20,650
[SPEAKER_28]: This is all true.

1351
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:25,352
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the funny thing about this video and why you people are laughing at it, because if you've ever been to play D&D, this is it.

1352
01:28:25,672 --> 01:28:26,753
[SPEAKER_28]: It really is like this.

1353
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:29,434
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you a D&D player, Alan?

1354
01:28:30,795 --> 01:28:30,915
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1355
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:31,870
[SPEAKER_28]: Never?

1356
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:32,791
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you never played D&D?

1357
01:28:32,951 --> 01:28:37,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought the rulebook, the kit, when I was in 6th or 7th grade, but I just read it.

1358
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:40,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I never actually had any friends to play with.

1359
01:28:40,295 --> 01:28:40,696
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting a call.

1360
01:28:40,736 --> 01:28:41,136
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm getting a call.

1361
01:28:41,276 --> 01:28:42,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1362
01:28:42,076 --> 01:28:42,377
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

1363
01:28:42,397 --> 01:28:45,278
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Simon Nathan.

1364
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:46,519
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, Nathan!

1365
01:28:46,599 --> 01:28:47,220
[SPEAKER_28]: How are you?

1366
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,400
[SPEAKER_18]: You got any Cheetos?

1367
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:51,262
[SPEAKER_18]: You got any Mountain Dew?

1368
01:28:51,903 --> 01:28:52,203
[SPEAKER_28]: Hold on.

1369
01:28:52,423 --> 01:29:00,548
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll get back to the funny in a minute, but Nathan started this whole stupid D&D conversation in the first place, so you're a D&D nerd, right, Nathan?

1370
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:00,648
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1371
01:29:02,673 --> 01:29:03,994
[SPEAKER_28]: and you still play D&D, right?

1372
01:29:04,054 --> 01:29:04,694
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm the dungeon master.

1373
01:29:05,155 --> 01:29:06,355
[SPEAKER_28]: You're the dungeon master?

1374
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:06,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1375
01:29:06,836 --> 01:29:07,836
[SPEAKER_28]: Right, okay.

1376
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,117
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm the gatekeeper, you're the key master.

1377
01:29:10,217 --> 01:29:10,598
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

1378
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,459
[SPEAKER_17]: He's the dungeon master and you're the cavalier.

1379
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:14,140
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, shush.

1380
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:17,741
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so you wanted to talk about me playing Dungeons & Dragons.

1381
01:29:17,781 --> 01:29:21,283
[SPEAKER_28]: So what was it like to have me as your player in Dungeons & Dragons?

1382
01:29:23,865 --> 01:29:27,987
[SPEAKER_09]: You do remember the orc panty seller, right?

1383
01:29:28,907 --> 01:29:29,688
[SPEAKER_28]: Vaguely, yes.

1384
01:29:30,008 --> 01:29:31,009
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I do actually.

1385
01:29:31,049 --> 01:29:31,509
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I do.

1386
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:43,184
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys wanted to buy your fancy lingerie because all you dudes and women were playing women characters and they needed fancy lingerie.

1387
01:29:47,328 --> 01:29:48,769
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, it's important.

1388
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,131
[SPEAKER_18]: This is fantastic.

1389
01:29:51,171 --> 01:29:51,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep going.

1390
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:52,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to hear more, please.

1391
01:29:56,075 --> 01:29:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Rob roll his charisma check?

1392
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:01,512
[SPEAKER_09]: The normal go-down-kill rats in the basement.

1393
01:30:01,672 --> 01:30:04,313
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to fight undead chickens.

1394
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:07,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, I remember that quest.

1395
01:30:07,134 --> 01:30:08,195
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually distinctly remember.

1396
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:11,016
[SPEAKER_28]: That was like one of the first... I think it was like the first or second night we ever played.

1397
01:30:11,056 --> 01:30:12,836
[SPEAKER_28]: We did the undead chickens in the basement.

1398
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,917
[SPEAKER_18]: But I have to know, did Rob make his charisma rolls?

1399
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:20,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Did he save or fail?

1400
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:21,780
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, stop.

1401
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,240
[SPEAKER_28]: Let the man talk, DarkSakura.

1402
01:30:24,621 --> 01:30:25,101
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um...

1403
01:30:26,727 --> 01:30:27,568
[SPEAKER_28]: No, that's Panda Lady's

1404
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:48,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Sister is here visiting.

1405
01:30:48,885 --> 01:30:49,545
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, say hello.

1406
01:30:49,585 --> 01:30:51,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell what we said hello and send our love from OLR.

1407
01:30:53,426 --> 01:30:55,066
[SPEAKER_26]: What was I going to ask?

1408
01:30:55,206 --> 01:30:56,047
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, Rice Princess.

1409
01:30:56,307 --> 01:30:57,747
[SPEAKER_28]: Say hello and all that.

1410
01:30:58,027 --> 01:31:00,448
[SPEAKER_28]: What was I going to say about... Oh, yes.

1411
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:03,549
[SPEAKER_28]: How was it having me in your game?

1412
01:31:03,569 --> 01:31:07,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Because Alan really likes to hear stories about how terrible my ex was.

1413
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:12,951
[SPEAKER_28]: How was it having me in the game versus having my ex in the game, allegedly?

1414
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:14,872
[SPEAKER_09]: It

1415
01:31:16,753 --> 01:31:18,594
[SPEAKER_09]: It took extra time.

1416
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:19,955
[SPEAKER_09]: He slowed things down.

1417
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:33,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Your very first quest, you were in a basement with shelves, and he decided that he wanted to climb these shelves to get a better look at the surroundings of the basement.

1418
01:31:40,211 --> 01:31:48,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see that happening once, but he tried it at least three times, one of which he rolled a natural one and knocked over the shelf.

1419
01:31:50,716 --> 01:31:53,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is just like real life, allegedly.

1420
01:31:55,179 --> 01:31:56,219
[SPEAKER_16]: This is fantastic.

1421
01:31:58,940 --> 01:31:59,901
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

1422
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:02,882
[SPEAKER_28]: He was interesting.

1423
01:32:03,483 --> 01:32:04,803
[SPEAKER_18]: He was special.

1424
01:32:05,404 --> 01:32:06,404
[SPEAKER_28]: But he's not here anymore.

1425
01:32:06,444 --> 01:32:07,425
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the important thing, right?

1426
01:32:08,665 --> 01:32:09,886
[SPEAKER_09]: He kept thinking that

1427
01:32:10,771 --> 01:32:15,493
[SPEAKER_09]: The cleric was a priest and he kept trying to cast his wow spells in D&D.

1428
01:32:15,753 --> 01:32:16,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Cast smite.

1429
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Smite.

1430
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:20,435
[SPEAKER_14]: I want the bubble.

1431
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll cast a bubble.

1432
01:32:21,456 --> 01:32:22,896
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to cast a bubble.

1433
01:32:27,178 --> 01:32:29,740
[SPEAKER_28]: Nathan's laughing because he knows I'm telling the truth.

1434
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,401
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not exaggerating anything.

1435
01:32:33,661 --> 01:32:34,962
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what happened.

1436
01:32:38,942 --> 01:32:40,003
[SPEAKER_28]: Good times, good times.

1437
01:32:41,284 --> 01:32:46,768
[SPEAKER_28]: Sadly, I'm not playing D&D with you guys anymore because I travel to the Bay pretty much every weekend when you guys play.

1438
01:32:47,148 --> 01:32:50,210
[SPEAKER_28]: But what kind of adventures do you do in D&D now?

1439
01:32:52,932 --> 01:32:55,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, they're not too ridiculous.

1440
01:32:58,876 --> 01:33:05,581
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was a big asshole who everyone kind of hates who's the big hero of the town.

1441
01:33:06,522 --> 01:33:07,703
[SPEAKER_09]: His name's Larbio.

1442
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:11,191
[SPEAKER_09]: and he's modeled after Fabio.

1443
01:33:12,032 --> 01:33:14,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Only more sexual harassment involved.

1444
01:33:15,273 --> 01:33:17,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Does his hair have its own saving throw?

1445
01:33:19,035 --> 01:33:19,295
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1446
01:33:19,455 --> 01:33:20,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Does his hair have its own saving throw?

1447
01:33:23,337 --> 01:33:30,261
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but he did have commercials for a fancy type of butter.

1448
01:33:30,781 --> 01:33:32,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe it's not butter light.

1449
01:33:33,342 --> 01:33:36,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing about that was it glowed in the dark.

1450
01:33:38,962 --> 01:33:39,862
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fantastic.

1451
01:33:42,203 --> 01:33:43,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Your games totally rock.

1452
01:33:44,845 --> 01:33:45,505
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I know.

1453
01:33:46,765 --> 01:33:47,166
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1454
01:33:49,147 --> 01:33:51,908
[SPEAKER_28]: One of these days, Nathan, I'm going to have to drop in and make a cameo.

1455
01:33:52,108 --> 01:33:55,430
[SPEAKER_28]: If I could find my old character sheet, although to be honest, I think it's long gone.

1456
01:33:55,470 --> 01:34:00,312
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's in that box of things that remind me of the X that got shredded when I left.

1457
01:34:00,352 --> 01:34:01,733
[SPEAKER_28]: So sadly, I don't know if I have it anymore.

1458
01:34:02,073 --> 01:34:04,334
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'll have to make a cameo at some point in your game.

1459
01:34:04,795 --> 01:34:05,235
[SPEAKER_28]: It'll be fun.

1460
01:34:05,894 --> 01:34:09,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Every once in a while we've done some drunk D&D nights.

1461
01:34:09,137 --> 01:34:11,119
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done two of those so far.

1462
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:16,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And Eddie has actually come to those.

1463
01:34:16,825 --> 01:34:26,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And one time we played the campaign module that the guys from Penny Arcade had made and was making fun of the Twilight movies.

1464
01:34:27,796 --> 01:34:28,317
[SPEAKER_28]: Very nice.

1465
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:32,644
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, you're more than welcome to stop by.

1466
01:34:33,225 --> 01:34:36,048
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a perfect time because we don't do any big campaigns.

1467
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:39,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something stupid and we get drunk and laugh.

1468
01:34:39,772 --> 01:34:41,013
[SPEAKER_28]: I will absolutely do that.

1469
01:34:41,133 --> 01:34:42,214
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'll cast Bubble.

1470
01:34:42,455 --> 01:34:43,295
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I cast Bubble?

1471
01:34:45,838 --> 01:34:46,038
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1472
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:46,599
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1473
01:34:46,699 --> 01:34:48,241
[SPEAKER_26]: This is not wild.

1474
01:34:48,937 --> 01:35:15,782
[SPEAKER_28]: and that's exactly how Nathan would have to respond to like trying to bite his tongue like you could sense he just wants to jump over the table and be like you're fucking ruining my fucking game you little shit like you just no you can't you can't you can't do that this is this is D&D you not wow it's not no no all right Nathan thank you so much for calling in and good luck with the D&D okay no problem you have a good time the rest of your hours oh we will take care buddy all right bye

1475
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:20,359
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna call him For this incarnation I'm gonna yell at him right now

1476
01:35:55,091 --> 01:35:55,351
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello?

1477
01:35:55,571 --> 01:35:56,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi Shane, how are you?

1478
01:35:56,372 --> 01:35:56,752
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Rob.

1479
01:35:58,012 --> 01:35:58,973
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, I'm good.

1480
01:35:59,113 --> 01:36:00,654
[SPEAKER_28]: You're live on the radio, et cetera, et cetera.

1481
01:36:01,014 --> 01:36:01,674
[SPEAKER_28]: You playing WoW?

1482
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:02,534
[SPEAKER_08]: You playing the beta?

1483
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:03,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1484
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:04,895
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, I wasn't playing the beta.

1485
01:36:04,956 --> 01:36:05,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I was fishing.

1486
01:36:05,936 --> 01:36:06,376
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, hold on.

1487
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:08,437
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to ask you a question because this is really important, okay?

1488
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:09,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to answer it.

1489
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:10,638
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you do.

1490
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:12,399
[SPEAKER_28]: How did we meet?

1491
01:36:14,212 --> 01:36:14,592
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't.

1492
01:36:14,612 --> 01:36:15,393
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't pay attention.

1493
01:36:41,684 --> 01:36:43,706
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just words that come out of the radio.

1494
01:36:43,746 --> 01:36:46,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, okay, if there's something that's interesting, I'll pick it up.

1495
01:36:46,809 --> 01:36:48,011
[SPEAKER_08]: But a phone number?

1496
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:50,713
[SPEAKER_28]: Nah.

1497
01:36:50,733 --> 01:36:54,938
[SPEAKER_28]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Oh, see, I was going to dial 1-866.

1498
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think I got the other two things right.

1499
01:36:57,901 --> 01:36:59,723
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, wait, that could be wrong.

1500
01:36:59,903 --> 01:37:00,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I might get like...

1501
01:37:01,499 --> 01:37:12,543
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, a porn line or something Yeah, it's 877, just for the future Just so you know Alright, well, I'm calling you because you were telling me about a bunch of cool stuff you saw this past week So where were you?

1502
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:13,363
[SPEAKER_28]: What was going on?

1503
01:37:13,423 --> 01:37:15,644
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know what you can and can't say Where were you at?

1504
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:16,344
[SPEAKER_28]: What were you doing?

1505
01:37:16,784 --> 01:37:17,224
[SPEAKER_28]: What's cool?

1506
01:37:17,244 --> 01:37:27,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the GameStop Managers Conference in Austin, but not San Antonio Is there... What's awesome in San Antonio?

1507
01:37:27,268 --> 01:37:27,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyone?

1508
01:37:27,968 --> 01:37:30,109
[SPEAKER_28]: The Alamo Did you go to the Alamo?

1509
01:37:31,184 --> 01:37:32,585
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not a tourist.

1510
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care about that stuff.

1511
01:37:35,528 --> 01:37:39,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what the Alamo is because I think people died there or something.

1512
01:37:40,532 --> 01:37:41,953
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you say tortilla?

1513
01:37:42,493 --> 01:37:43,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Tortilla.

1514
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:45,606
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that Showgirls?

1515
01:37:45,827 --> 01:37:50,230
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I think they played a clip of that at our conference because it was like she was in a phone booth and

1516
01:38:08,144 --> 01:38:09,387
[SPEAKER_08]: The stars at night shine big and bright

1517
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:23,496
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it will if I end in rape or shooting

1518
01:38:42,386 --> 01:38:44,367
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time I went to, whoa, that's loud.

1519
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:48,930
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time I went to a manager's conference in Texas, that was exactly the first thing I did.

1520
01:38:49,631 --> 01:38:50,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it?

1521
01:38:50,712 --> 01:38:51,472
[SPEAKER_12]: I called Mystique.

1522
01:38:51,832 --> 01:38:54,014
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, hey, I'm in Texas.

1523
01:38:54,414 --> 01:38:55,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, I'll prove it.

1524
01:38:56,636 --> 01:38:57,696
[SPEAKER_12]: And the people played along.

1525
01:38:57,736 --> 01:38:58,317
[SPEAKER_12]: It was amazing.

1526
01:39:00,418 --> 01:39:00,778
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice.

1527
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,101
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to the conference this year, Dan.

1528
01:39:04,561 --> 01:39:06,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I haven't gone to a GameStop conference for a while.

1529
01:39:06,862 --> 01:39:07,623
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm missing, I know.

1530
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:09,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'm sorry I did too.

1531
01:39:09,284 --> 01:39:09,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, uh...

1532
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:16,656
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so tell us, I don't know what you can or can't tell us about the conference, Shane, but tell us about your experience there at the conference.

1533
01:39:18,057 --> 01:39:18,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, let's see.

1534
01:39:19,178 --> 01:39:21,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll start off with some highs.

1535
01:39:22,522 --> 01:39:27,586
[SPEAKER_08]: The very first thing that we had to see, we were broken into groups, so we had to go to different vendors.

1536
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:36,675
[SPEAKER_08]: The very first thing we saw in my group was a trailer of tons of different fatalities from the new Mortal Kombat game, and they were hilarious.

1537
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Any that you remember?

1538
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:39,770
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1539
01:39:40,451 --> 01:39:41,292
[SPEAKER_28]: Any that you remember?

1540
01:39:42,272 --> 01:39:43,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1541
01:39:43,554 --> 01:39:47,677
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one where a reptile threw up in somebody's mouth, like a whole bunch of acid.

1542
01:39:47,717 --> 01:39:48,418
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

1543
01:39:48,438 --> 01:39:50,299
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I saw a porn like that once, actually.

1544
01:39:51,881 --> 01:40:03,931
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one where Sector blew up somebody's torso into a few different pieces, and as the pieces were flying up into the air, he locked onto each individual piece and shot missiles at them, so it made them explode even more.

1545
01:40:03,951 --> 01:40:04,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1546
01:40:05,212 --> 01:40:05,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1547
01:40:05,902 --> 01:40:23,450
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one where Skurkin cut right through the guy at the waistline and he didn't fall over or anything and then he cut the guy through the neck all the way through and then he kicked the torso so just the torso flew and then the head flew up and he took his little knife and sliced the head in half.

1548
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:25,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, that's hilarious.

1549
01:40:26,552 --> 01:40:27,913
[SPEAKER_28]: This is sounding like a Saw movie.

1550
01:40:27,933 --> 01:40:29,473
[SPEAKER_18]: What were the stage ones?

1551
01:40:29,513 --> 01:40:30,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you see any of those?

1552
01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:51,367
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they didn't show any stage ones, but they did show in the new acid pit place, or old acid pit place, I guess you would call it, one of the background dudes that was hanging, like, you saw him get dipped into the acid, and he was, like, screaming and freaking out, and then they pulled him back up, and he wasn't on a skeleton, he was, like, this fleshy, dead...

1553
01:40:53,724 --> 01:40:54,705
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fantastic.

1554
01:40:55,346 --> 01:40:57,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it like the Mortal Kombat 2 acid pit?

1555
01:40:58,428 --> 01:40:58,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1556
01:40:59,349 --> 01:41:00,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1557
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:02,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I want this game.

1558
01:41:02,231 --> 01:41:03,773
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds hot.

1559
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:08,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this has come out yet, but I don't care.

1560
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:14,802
[SPEAKER_08]: They had tag team combo things like they do in the Marvel vs. Capcom games.

1561
01:41:14,862 --> 01:41:18,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could be beating somebody up and then tag in another partner and they'll jump right in.

1562
01:41:19,605 --> 01:41:20,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

1563
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:22,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was crazy cool.

1564
01:41:23,188 --> 01:41:23,728
[SPEAKER_28]: That's interesting.

1565
01:41:23,748 --> 01:41:26,530
[SPEAKER_28]: So they stole that from Marvel vs. Capcom, it sounds like.

1566
01:41:26,751 --> 01:41:27,251
[SPEAKER_28]: It's awesome.

1567
01:41:28,132 --> 01:41:31,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I don't know if any other games did it before, but probably not.

1568
01:41:32,555 --> 01:41:34,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what else was cool there?

1569
01:41:36,358 --> 01:41:37,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot.

1570
01:41:40,281 --> 01:41:43,884
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that was the coolest thing I think I saw, which is kind of sad.

1571
01:41:44,664 --> 01:41:45,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get to play Diablo 3.

1572
01:41:46,906 --> 01:41:47,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know how to play it.

1573
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to play it like WoW and that got me killed pretty quick and nice.

1574
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:52,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, I'm done.

1575
01:41:52,281 --> 01:41:52,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I give up.

1576
01:41:52,842 --> 01:41:53,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

1577
01:41:54,242 --> 01:41:55,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to play it.

1578
01:41:55,122 --> 01:41:57,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that I'm terrible at it and I won't buy it.

1579
01:41:58,204 --> 01:41:59,044
[SPEAKER_28]: You're not going to buy it.

1580
01:41:59,104 --> 01:41:59,984
[SPEAKER_28]: Diablo is awesome.

1581
01:42:00,905 --> 01:42:02,065
[SPEAKER_28]: I like it better than StarCraft.

1582
01:42:02,085 --> 01:42:03,305
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to get my budget for StarCraft.

1583
01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:07,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not buying StarCraft either, but if they give me a WoW pet, maybe I'll get it.

1584
01:42:08,387 --> 01:42:09,087
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what have you been doing?

1585
01:42:09,107 --> 01:42:11,568
[SPEAKER_28]: Because I know you were able to get into the Cata Beta as well.

1586
01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:13,429
[SPEAKER_28]: What have you been doing in the Cata Beta?

1587
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:24,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I have played a Worgen up to 12 almost, and then a Goblin up to 4, because that's where the quest is currently broken and we can't proceed.

1588
01:42:25,582 --> 01:42:27,583
[SPEAKER_08]: The Worgen's pretty cool.

1589
01:42:28,283 --> 01:42:29,443
[SPEAKER_08]: The game doesn't feel like WoW.

1590
01:42:29,683 --> 01:42:30,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say that right now.

1591
01:42:30,643 --> 01:42:36,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not feel like the same game we've been playing for so many years, just going through the Worgen and Goblin experience.

1592
01:42:36,645 --> 01:42:41,526
[SPEAKER_08]: But the Worgen's all depressing, and, oh, we've got to save our home from these attacks.

1593
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:42,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God, we're going to die.

1594
01:42:43,619 --> 01:42:51,464
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was like, let me get some bling glasses and I got running over people with my car and it's the best.

1595
01:42:51,764 --> 01:42:53,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Love the Goblin area so, so much.

1596
01:42:53,865 --> 01:42:56,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I was laughing the entire time.

1597
01:42:56,126 --> 01:42:57,327
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't know what to do at first.

1598
01:42:57,347 --> 01:42:57,587
[SPEAKER_28]: I was like,

1599
01:43:04,935 --> 01:43:07,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really close to this guy, why am I not throwing the barrel?

1600
01:43:07,116 --> 01:43:08,777
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you have to get right up next to him.

1601
01:43:08,797 --> 01:43:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that was pretty funny and I laughed at that.

1602
01:43:11,559 --> 01:43:13,100
[SPEAKER_26]: That was awesome.

1603
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:17,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do a spoiler for the Worgen questline, you know, whatever.

1604
01:43:18,183 --> 01:43:18,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1605
01:43:18,843 --> 01:43:20,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was a fun glitch that happened.

1606
01:43:21,124 --> 01:43:32,991
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a part where you're fighting Sylvanas and the whole town is fighting Sylvanas and she knocks you back and she's about to shoot Gen Greymane, the leader of the Worgen people.

1607
01:43:33,664 --> 01:43:35,225
[SPEAKER_08]: with this poison arrow, I guess.

1608
01:43:35,586 --> 01:43:38,668
[SPEAKER_08]: But instead, his son jumps up front to take the arrow.

1609
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:42,411
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I played, she was facing the opposite direction.

1610
01:43:42,771 --> 01:43:48,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So she shot, like, facing to the screen's left, and the prince was right behind her.

1611
01:43:48,596 --> 01:43:49,517
[SPEAKER_08]: But it still killed him.

1612
01:43:49,537 --> 01:43:49,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like...

1613
01:43:50,717 --> 01:43:51,957
[SPEAKER_08]: That just ruins the mood.

1614
01:43:52,397 --> 01:43:54,398
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't see that part.

1615
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:55,638
[SPEAKER_28]: It just skipped over it, I think.

1616
01:43:55,658 --> 01:43:57,219
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't read that at all.

1617
01:43:57,259 --> 01:43:57,939
[SPEAKER_28]: It's in the church.

1618
01:43:57,979 --> 01:43:58,199
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

1619
01:43:58,219 --> 01:44:02,740
[SPEAKER_28]: I knew there was one there, but I didn't see anything on the screen telling me that something was going to happen.

1620
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it was going to happen, but...

1621
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:47,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really care about my worgen nearly as much as I care about the goblin now because the goblin is so funny like the music is all like I don't know whimsical when you play as a goblin in your radio that goes only to 11 but yeah I like it it's not wow what we're used to but it's neat to the evolution of the game

1622
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:50,470
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, you haven't checked out any of the new areas yet?

1623
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:51,611
[SPEAKER_28]: Because that's what I'm waiting to do.

1624
01:44:51,631 --> 01:44:54,293
[SPEAKER_28]: I want my stupid character to copy over so I can check out the new areas.

1625
01:44:54,753 --> 01:44:56,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I still can't get my character to copy over.

1626
01:44:57,695 --> 01:45:00,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm at Darkshore now.

1627
01:45:00,938 --> 01:45:01,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's where I'm at.

1628
01:45:02,759 --> 01:45:07,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll get to see that area redone, but no character copying over.

1629
01:45:07,562 --> 01:45:09,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It's making me a little sad.

1630
01:45:10,365 --> 01:45:11,425
[SPEAKER_28]: I was having the same problem.

1631
01:45:11,686 --> 01:45:12,106
[SPEAKER_28]: What can you do?

1632
01:45:13,058 --> 01:45:17,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, like a month ago, I wouldn't have ever said this, but I think I'm a huge Microsoft down boy now.

1633
01:45:17,643 --> 01:45:17,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Why?

1634
01:45:37,523 --> 01:45:38,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So your loyalty can be bought?

1635
01:45:38,283 --> 01:45:38,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1636
01:45:38,363 --> 01:45:40,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I pay you like $20, you'll wear like an Orange Lounge radio sticker to work?

1637
01:45:40,524 --> 01:45:40,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wear a sticker?

1638
01:45:40,964 --> 01:45:41,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1639
01:45:41,065 --> 01:45:41,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I wear stickers?

1640
01:45:41,565 --> 01:45:42,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you wear a shirt?

1641
01:45:42,565 --> 01:45:45,226
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I can't wear a shirt that says Orange Lounge to work.

1642
01:45:45,246 --> 01:45:45,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Fail.

1643
01:46:06,756 --> 01:46:08,798
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'll pretend and I'll still take the $20.

1644
01:46:08,838 --> 01:46:11,480
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not going to cut it.

1645
01:46:11,521 --> 01:46:12,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wear that sticker.

1646
01:46:12,962 --> 01:46:14,944
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're letting you go.

1647
01:46:15,084 --> 01:46:17,647
[SPEAKER_28]: You're useless to me without being able to promote.

1648
01:46:17,727 --> 01:46:19,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, take care.

1649
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:20,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you too.

1650
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:21,271
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

1651
01:46:22,192 --> 01:46:23,513
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, thank you Shane for being on.

1652
01:46:23,533 --> 01:46:24,454
[SPEAKER_28]: Appreciate the phone calls.

1653
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:26,015
[SPEAKER_28]: Good times.

1654
01:46:29,904 --> 01:46:36,432
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, which would... Oh, I never played the rest of this Dungeons & Dragons thing, so should I finish this, even though the mood is gone?

1655
01:46:36,853 --> 01:46:38,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Or start it over.

1656
01:46:38,695 --> 01:46:39,456
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, why not?

1657
01:46:40,137 --> 01:46:41,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Dungeons & Dragons

1658
01:46:42,572 --> 01:46:43,753
[SPEAKER_21]: Satan's Game.

1659
01:46:44,633 --> 01:47:00,384
[SPEAKER_21]: Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.

1660
01:47:01,064 --> 01:47:07,451
[SPEAKER_21]: This afternoon, the Dead Alewives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.

1661
01:47:08,111 --> 01:47:17,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons & Dragons.

1662
01:47:19,417 --> 01:47:20,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Galstaff.

1663
01:47:20,638 --> 01:47:22,440
[SPEAKER_13]: You have entered the door to the north.

1664
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:26,225
[SPEAKER_13]: You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.

1665
01:47:26,765 --> 01:47:30,670
[SPEAKER_13]: The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.

1666
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:32,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are the Cheetos?

1667
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:33,433
[SPEAKER_13]: They're right next to you.

1668
01:47:33,753 --> 01:47:34,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I cast a spell.

1669
01:47:35,054 --> 01:47:36,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's the Mountain Dew?

1670
01:47:36,456 --> 01:47:37,918
[SPEAKER_13]: In the fridge, duh.

1671
01:47:38,098 --> 01:47:39,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to cast a spell.

1672
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:40,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I have a

1673
01:47:41,067 --> 01:47:42,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you can have them out and do.

1674
01:47:42,768 --> 01:47:43,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Just go get it.

1675
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:45,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I can cast any of these, right?

1676
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:45,810
[SPEAKER_13]: On the list?

1677
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, any of the first level ones.

1678
01:47:47,871 --> 01:47:49,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get a soda.

1679
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:50,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone want one?

1680
01:47:50,613 --> 01:47:52,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Cram, I'm not in the room, right?

1681
01:47:53,054 --> 01:47:53,854
[SPEAKER_13]: What room?

1682
01:47:54,315 --> 01:47:56,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to cast Magic Missile.

1683
01:47:56,696 --> 01:47:59,618
[SPEAKER_11]: The room where he's casting all these spells from.

1684
01:47:59,678 --> 01:48:01,559
[SPEAKER_13]: He hasn't cast anything yet.

1685
01:48:01,939 --> 01:48:03,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I am, though, if you'd listen.

1686
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,341
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm casting Magic Missile.

1687
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:07,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are you casting Magic Missile?

1688
01:48:07,042 --> 01:48:08,363
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing to attack here.

1689
01:48:10,051 --> 01:48:11,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm attacking the darkness!

1690
01:48:14,834 --> 01:48:15,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine, fine.

1691
01:48:16,035 --> 01:48:17,255
[SPEAKER_13]: You attack the darkness.

1692
01:48:17,556 --> 01:48:18,936
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an elf in front of you.

1693
01:48:18,956 --> 01:48:19,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa!

1694
01:48:19,717 --> 01:48:20,417
[SPEAKER_13]: That's me, right?

1695
01:48:20,737 --> 01:48:26,141
[SPEAKER_13]: He's wearing a brown tunic, and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

1696
01:48:26,261 --> 01:48:26,921
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't.

1697
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:27,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I have gray eyes.

1698
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:29,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see that sheet.

1699
01:48:29,443 --> 01:48:33,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it says I have blue, but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

1700
01:48:33,405 --> 01:48:33,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

1701
01:48:34,005 --> 01:48:36,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, you guys can talk to each other now if you want.

1702
01:48:37,932 --> 01:48:38,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1703
01:48:38,852 --> 01:48:39,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1704
01:48:39,893 --> 01:48:42,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

1705
01:48:42,794 --> 01:48:44,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?

1706
01:48:48,036 --> 01:48:49,697
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are being attacked.

1707
01:48:51,753 --> 01:48:54,094
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're outside by the tavern.

1708
01:48:54,174 --> 01:48:55,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool, I get drunk.

1709
01:48:56,495 --> 01:48:58,837
[SPEAKER_13]: There are seven ogres surrounding you.

1710
01:48:58,977 --> 01:48:59,997
[SPEAKER_10]: How could they surround us?

1711
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:02,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Mordenkainen's magical watchdog cast.

1712
01:49:02,418 --> 01:49:03,079
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you didn't.

1713
01:49:03,239 --> 01:49:04,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting drunk.

1714
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:05,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any girls there?

1715
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally did.

1716
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:10,082
[SPEAKER_10]: You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no.

1717
01:49:10,402 --> 01:49:15,485
[SPEAKER_10]: But I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainen's faithful watchdog.

1718
01:49:15,505 --> 01:49:17,105
[SPEAKER_13]: But you never actually cast it.

1719
01:49:17,225 --> 01:49:19,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk.

1720
01:49:20,567 --> 01:49:21,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you are.

1721
01:49:21,747 --> 01:49:23,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any girls there?

1722
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:23,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1723
01:49:23,828 --> 01:49:24,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I did, though.

1724
01:49:24,748 --> 01:49:26,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I completely said when you asked me.

1725
01:49:26,848 --> 01:49:27,629
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you didn't.

1726
01:49:27,929 --> 01:49:30,669
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell.

1727
01:49:30,709 --> 01:49:32,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So now there's ogres, okay?

1728
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:32,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Ogres?

1729
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:35,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, I got an ogre slaying knife.

1730
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:37,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a plus nine against ogres.

1731
01:49:37,451 --> 01:49:38,411
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not there.

1732
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:39,531
[SPEAKER_13]: You're getting drunk.

1733
01:49:39,671 --> 01:49:43,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but if there's any girls there, I want to do them.

1734
01:49:43,752 --> 01:49:44,773
[SPEAKER_21]: There you have it.

1735
01:49:45,193 --> 01:49:48,954
[SPEAKER_21]: A frightening look into America's most frightening pastime.

1736
01:49:49,515 --> 01:49:55,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare.

1737
01:49:56,118 --> 01:50:01,440
[SPEAKER_21]: It's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast when they couldn't do one single pull-up.

1738
01:50:03,561 --> 01:50:03,961
[SPEAKER_28]: All true.

1739
01:50:04,422 --> 01:50:04,722
[SPEAKER_28]: All of it.

1740
01:50:05,502 --> 01:50:06,242
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1741
01:50:06,463 --> 01:50:07,063
[SPEAKER_28]: 100% true.

1742
01:50:07,643 --> 01:50:08,764
[SPEAKER_28]: Including the pull-up.

1743
01:50:14,189 --> 01:50:17,912
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually, you know, funny enough, Nathan thinks that he popped my D&D cherry, but that's not true.

1744
01:50:17,952 --> 01:50:20,134
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually played in high school with some friends of mine.

1745
01:50:20,454 --> 01:50:26,839
[SPEAKER_28]: I hadn't played in years and years after that, but there was a little group of us in high school that used to play, and it was fun.

1746
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,161
[SPEAKER_28]: One of my friends was really into it.

1747
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:32,864
[SPEAKER_28]: He would talk about the campaign at times that wasn't appropriate.

1748
01:50:33,004 --> 01:50:33,685
[SPEAKER_28]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1749
01:50:56,565 --> 01:51:09,548
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know, but you, me, and Ben will all start talking about WoW like, oh yeah, there was that raid yesterday and oh man, the fight and if we'd only done this differently and you can see Jim and Victoria looking at each other like how far away are we from the bar?

1750
01:51:15,969 --> 01:51:16,529
[SPEAKER_28]: Good times.

1751
01:51:16,769 --> 01:51:18,850
[SPEAKER_14]: And what are we going to do as soon as we get back to your place?

1752
01:51:20,433 --> 01:51:32,958
[SPEAKER_28]: We gotta run the daily, that's why this marathon has to be over before 3am when the frickin' servers reset 4, 4am I'm kidding, I'm kidding, God We missed the daily yesterday, Friday?

1753
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:39,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Two days ago Didn't kill us We didn't do a daily That's alright, we'll be okay So you owe me two frosts, I'm very upset

1754
01:51:41,351 --> 01:51:43,012
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I... Okay.

1755
01:51:43,293 --> 01:51:44,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, kids.

1756
01:51:44,654 --> 01:51:45,434
[SPEAKER_18]: I told Alan.

1757
01:51:45,674 --> 01:51:54,721
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm like, Alan, you might want to mark yourself tentative for the raid Monday because I don't know if we're going to be able to run because you're going to be visiting me and, you know... We might go out for Labor Day.

1758
01:51:54,762 --> 01:51:56,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we might go out because it's Labor Day.

1759
01:51:56,163 --> 01:51:56,983
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I have the day off.

1760
01:51:57,023 --> 01:51:57,624
[SPEAKER_28]: And Alan's like...

1761
01:51:59,378 --> 01:51:59,818
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just helping.

1762
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:00,019
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just...

1763
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:53,073
[SPEAKER_28]: You should be saying, oh, yes Come to dinner with me Let me get you outside the house at 8 o'clock Let's get ice cream tomorrow Let's go to Pinkberry Let's go to Pinkberry No, here's the thing, I'm going to tell Alan We will go to Pinkberry tomorrow, but we're only going to go to Pinkberry At 7.50 That's the only time we can go to Pinkberry

1764
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,522
[SPEAKER_28]: Pinkberry's closed the rest of the day for inventory.

1765
01:52:56,742 --> 01:52:57,262
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fine.

1766
01:52:57,403 --> 01:52:58,523
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just playing along.

1767
01:52:58,744 --> 01:52:59,404
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I know.

1768
01:52:59,644 --> 01:52:59,904
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

1769
01:53:01,105 --> 01:53:01,445
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

1770
01:53:02,426 --> 01:53:05,869
[SPEAKER_28]: Jvmon in chat says, I was going to play WoW with my boyfriend, but then he dumped me.

1771
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,531
[SPEAKER_28]: Debbie Downer.

1772
01:53:10,152 --> 01:53:10,412
[SPEAKER_28]: No, but...

1773
01:53:10,816 --> 01:53:11,256
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what?

1774
01:53:11,837 --> 01:53:13,798
[SPEAKER_28]: The couple that games together stays together.

1775
01:53:14,019 --> 01:53:16,140
[SPEAKER_28]: Or at least appreciates each other's nerddom.

1776
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:30,052
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I've dated guys in the past, you know, and I've talked about this in the past on the show, is that part of the difficulty of being gay sometimes is that most gay guys you meet are like, let's talk about fashion, let's talk about Madonna, or oh my god, Lady Gaga, you know, all this stuff.

1777
01:53:30,132 --> 01:53:38,739
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, it's just like, I'm not, like, you know, I like Lady Gaga, I guess, but as far as, like, all that other stuff, like, I'm not, like, into that.

1778
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:43,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Just play classes with different armor classes so you don't have to roll against the same loot.

1779
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:46,961
[SPEAKER_14]: And you will have a happy relationship.

1780
01:53:48,702 --> 01:53:51,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Clothy and a plate, you never have to roll on the same loot.

1781
01:53:52,503 --> 01:53:53,703
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be together for years.

1782
01:53:57,604 --> 01:53:58,784
[SPEAKER_28]: Hold on, we're getting a call.

1783
01:53:59,244 --> 01:54:00,485
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, damn it, I just missed it.

1784
01:54:00,545 --> 01:54:01,345
[SPEAKER_28]: That's alright, I'll call him back.

1785
01:54:02,105 --> 01:54:02,965
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll call him, I don't care.

1786
01:54:03,166 --> 01:54:03,626
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll call him.

1787
01:54:05,006 --> 01:54:07,827
[SPEAKER_28]: Because he's a WoW guildie, and so I'm sure he has some insight on this.

1788
01:54:08,757 --> 01:54:09,077
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

1789
01:54:09,678 --> 01:54:10,759
[SPEAKER_28]: I saw you were trying to call.

1790
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:11,259
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1791
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:12,320
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, no, no.

1792
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,681
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not taking no days off.

1793
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,525
[SPEAKER_15]: You and Alan take off, a.k.a.

1794
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:21,547
[SPEAKER_15]: you the best healer, Alan the best DPS.

1795
01:54:22,228 --> 01:54:24,209
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to be in a lot of trouble for our guild.

1796
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:26,411
[SPEAKER_15]: So, no, you're not taking tomorrow off.

1797
01:54:26,491 --> 01:54:27,432
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand it's a holiday.

1798
01:54:27,492 --> 01:54:28,293
[SPEAKER_15]: You schedule it.

1799
01:54:28,313 --> 01:54:29,173
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to show up.

1800
01:54:29,353 --> 01:54:30,534
[SPEAKER_15]: You know that's part of the deal.

1801
01:54:31,015 --> 01:54:32,076
[SPEAKER_15]: I want my frost badges.

1802
01:54:32,216 --> 01:54:33,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I want my T10 pants.

1803
01:54:33,937 --> 01:54:35,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't get my T10 pants unless you guys show up.

1804
01:54:36,744 --> 01:54:38,525
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to go get Pinkberry with me.

1805
01:54:38,545 --> 01:54:41,328
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get Pinkberry afterwards.

1806
01:54:41,388 --> 01:54:41,968
[SPEAKER_28]: It won't take that long.

1807
01:54:42,028 --> 01:54:44,230
[SPEAKER_28]: No, Pinkberry closes at 10 o'clock.

1808
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:45,091
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

1809
01:54:45,691 --> 01:54:48,053
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't stop rating until 10, 30, 11 o'clock.

1810
01:54:48,473 --> 01:54:49,874
[SPEAKER_15]: What's more important?

1811
01:54:49,954 --> 01:54:50,695
[SPEAKER_28]: God damn it.

1812
01:54:50,735 --> 01:54:51,576
[SPEAKER_28]: What's more important?

1813
01:54:51,616 --> 01:54:57,900
[SPEAKER_28]: Two Frost Badges or fucking original Pinkberry with watermelon and mango?

1814
01:54:59,121 --> 01:55:00,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Frost Badges because I could care less.

1815
01:55:02,053 --> 01:55:03,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not playing Star Trek Online right now.

1816
01:55:04,575 --> 01:55:05,496
[SPEAKER_28]: What is wrong with you?

1817
01:55:05,937 --> 01:55:07,458
[SPEAKER_28]: You're supposed to be supporting me in this.

1818
01:55:07,798 --> 01:55:09,059
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, Alan, come over.

1819
01:55:09,099 --> 01:55:10,460
[SPEAKER_28]: You can use my computer to raid.

1820
01:55:11,221 --> 01:55:12,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Screw you, lady.

1821
01:55:12,562 --> 01:55:13,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, Rob, Rob.

1822
01:55:13,223 --> 01:55:19,808
[SPEAKER_18]: No, because I forgot that the little sale is going on and I have some cryptic points left to spend and it's cheap right now.

1823
01:55:20,028 --> 01:55:20,949
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a sale, Rob.

1824
01:55:20,969 --> 01:55:23,091
[SPEAKER_18]: You are denying a woman a sale.

1825
01:55:24,412 --> 01:55:24,952
[SPEAKER_18]: For shame.

1826
01:55:25,553 --> 01:55:27,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Go raid with your party.

1827
01:55:28,035 --> 01:55:29,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Crossing very thin lines here.

1828
01:55:31,331 --> 01:55:31,872
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

1829
01:55:31,912 --> 01:55:32,753
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's cool, man.

1830
01:55:32,793 --> 01:55:33,674
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta take a day off.

1831
01:55:33,794 --> 01:55:34,575
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm just kidding.

1832
01:55:34,615 --> 01:55:35,757
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just funny the way you just said it.

1833
01:55:35,777 --> 01:55:36,298
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, you know what?

1834
01:55:36,338 --> 01:55:37,019
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need a show.

1835
01:55:37,099 --> 01:55:37,379
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1836
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,841
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't think so.

1837
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:40,844
[SPEAKER_15]: You know better.

1838
01:55:42,808 --> 01:55:43,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Alan, any comment?

1839
01:55:43,809 --> 01:55:50,273
[SPEAKER_14]: See, for those listening that have been considering playing WoW, this is what is waiting for you in the future.

1840
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:51,274
[SPEAKER_14]: This is real.

1841
01:55:52,034 --> 01:55:53,535
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, yeah.

1842
01:55:54,256 --> 01:56:00,860
[SPEAKER_14]: This is like an episode of, I don't know, Intervention and VH1 behind the guild right here.

1843
01:56:03,662 --> 01:56:04,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Nah, I love both of you guys.

1844
01:56:04,883 --> 01:56:05,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Nah.

1845
01:56:05,744 --> 01:56:06,704
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all your fault, Rob.

1846
01:56:06,745 --> 01:56:07,825
[SPEAKER_15]: You got me addicted on it.

1847
01:56:07,925 --> 01:56:08,386
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I know.

1848
01:56:08,426 --> 01:56:08,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

1849
01:56:08,986 --> 01:56:09,787
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a bad person.

1850
01:56:09,827 --> 01:56:10,167
[SPEAKER_28]: It's fine.

1851
01:56:11,098 --> 01:56:11,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Our phone's ringing.

1852
01:56:11,998 --> 01:56:13,539
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess I should take another call, alright?

1853
01:56:14,279 --> 01:56:14,859
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Rob.

1854
01:56:15,039 --> 01:56:17,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I still love you guys regardless if you show up or not.

1855
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,060
[SPEAKER_28]: No homo.

1856
01:56:26,963 --> 01:56:30,003
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the most unenthusiastic kissing noise I've ever heard in my life.

1857
01:56:35,005 --> 01:56:37,245
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't take it anymore.

1858
01:56:37,265 --> 01:56:38,546
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1859
01:56:38,586 --> 01:56:39,006
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

1860
01:56:40,236 --> 01:56:41,657
[SPEAKER_08]: What time is the raid tomorrow?

1861
01:56:41,677 --> 01:56:43,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I might be level 8 and I want to come.

1862
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:44,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1863
01:56:46,019 --> 01:56:46,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

1864
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:50,020
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1865
01:56:50,601 --> 01:56:51,281
[SPEAKER_28]: Hold on, folks.

1866
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:57,646
[SPEAKER_28]: We do a show here called Orange Lounge Radio where we talk about gaming and gaming culture.

1867
01:56:57,706 --> 01:57:03,491
[SPEAKER_28]: This is not the Danger Squad updates and important bulletins.

1868
01:57:03,671 --> 01:57:10,318
[SPEAKER_28]: I can just see there in guild chat now, that bitch just said he ain't coming to raid with us tomorrow because he got a pink berry.

1869
01:57:10,578 --> 01:57:11,319
[SPEAKER_28]: That fat bitch.

1870
01:57:13,361 --> 01:57:13,901
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, really?

1871
01:57:14,622 --> 01:57:16,604
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, 8 o'clock Pacific.

1872
01:57:18,277 --> 01:57:19,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay, 10 o'clock.

1873
01:57:19,958 --> 01:57:20,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go raid.

1874
01:57:20,698 --> 01:57:21,858
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you guys raiding?

1875
01:57:22,538 --> 01:57:24,019
[SPEAKER_28]: They're doing ICC, the second half.

1876
01:57:24,379 --> 01:57:27,900
[SPEAKER_28]: They're trying to do progression, so if you're in greens and blues, I don't know if that's a good idea.

1877
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be in tier 9, but you can still take me.

1878
01:57:30,761 --> 01:57:32,542
[SPEAKER_28]: We took somebody in greens and blues last week.

1879
01:57:32,582 --> 01:57:33,922
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't see why we wouldn't do it again.

1880
01:57:34,242 --> 01:57:35,122
[SPEAKER_28]: You need to talk to Tim.

1881
01:57:37,003 --> 01:57:37,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, sure.

1882
01:57:38,083 --> 01:57:41,324
[SPEAKER_08]: What's his radio show calling?

1883
01:57:45,248 --> 01:57:48,672
[SPEAKER_28]: I can make a joke here, but I don't want to out what he does, so I better not.

1884
01:57:50,074 --> 01:57:51,075
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a good one, Shane.

1885
01:57:51,696 --> 01:57:52,036
[SPEAKER_28]: Go raid.

1886
01:57:52,897 --> 01:57:53,097
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

1887
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,862
[SPEAKER_28]: He better be doing his daily every day.

1888
01:58:00,274 --> 01:58:01,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I spent my points.

1889
01:58:01,395 --> 01:58:02,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm logging out.

1890
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:03,576
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a rear admiral, Rob.

1891
01:58:04,197 --> 01:58:04,677
[SPEAKER_18]: That's funny.

1892
01:58:05,017 --> 01:58:05,858
[SPEAKER_28]: A rear admiral.

1893
01:58:06,978 --> 01:58:07,419
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

1894
01:58:08,499 --> 01:58:13,542
[SPEAKER_28]: Anonymous123 in our chatroom says, When you hear WoW talk and you've never played, you wish you could understand.

1895
01:58:13,582 --> 01:58:17,085
[SPEAKER_28]: When you play or haven't played WoW and you understand WoW talk, you wish you didn't understand.

1896
01:58:18,946 --> 01:58:20,206
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a good question.

1897
01:58:20,267 --> 01:58:22,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Define what a raid is for our listeners, Alan.

1898
01:58:25,367 --> 01:58:26,508
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Blaziken again.

1899
01:58:54,815 --> 01:58:56,096
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind, DJ Blazkid?

1900
01:58:57,797 --> 01:58:59,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not much.

1901
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:05,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Just putzing around Virtual Liberty City in GTA Ballad of Gay Tony now.

1902
01:59:05,884 --> 01:59:06,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Mm-hmm.

1903
01:59:07,725 --> 01:59:10,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally getting past that stupid chopper mission.

1904
01:59:10,888 --> 01:59:11,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Mm-hmm.

1905
01:59:12,669 --> 01:59:14,791
[SPEAKER_09]: But, okay, I don't know.

1906
01:59:14,891 --> 01:59:18,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Has anyone here played Metal Gear by chance?

1907
01:59:19,514 --> 01:59:22,517
[SPEAKER_18]: No, none of us in here have played Oh, No, The Truck Have Started to Move.

1908
01:59:22,537 --> 01:59:23,798
[SPEAKER_28]: The Truck Have Started to Move.

1909
01:59:26,012 --> 01:59:28,674
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically, I'm stuck on the Psycho Mantis battle.

1910
01:59:54,914 --> 01:59:55,935
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the best battle.

1911
01:59:55,955 --> 02:00:00,979
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me almost want to crack my PSP in half as we speak.

1912
02:00:01,099 --> 02:00:02,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I see you are a careful man.

1913
02:00:03,161 --> 02:00:04,081
[SPEAKER_18]: You save often.

1914
02:00:07,264 --> 02:00:10,506
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if it does this on the PSP, but it was so hardcore.

1915
02:00:10,526 --> 02:00:15,029
[SPEAKER_28]: That guy would read your memory card, and if you played other Konami games, he would freaking know.

1916
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:18,192
[SPEAKER_28]: And he'd be like, oh, you like to play Castlevania, do you?

1917
02:00:18,272 --> 02:00:19,573
[SPEAKER_28]: And you'd be like, oh my god!

1918
02:00:19,953 --> 02:00:21,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm possessed by the devil!

1919
02:00:23,207 --> 02:00:29,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have a Castlevania save on there and a DDR save on there, just for a random point.

1920
02:00:30,053 --> 02:00:35,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's just say here, yeah, you've read that, and you're like, you know, Rhythm Banner, something around those lines.

1921
02:00:36,439 --> 02:00:48,350
[SPEAKER_09]: But on top of also anger management and gaming, another thing that almost made me want to break on my controllers and or system is Guitar Hero 3, the freaking devil battle.

1922
02:00:49,457 --> 02:00:57,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost so many times on Hard, an expert to that guy What was that song in Guitar Hero 3 that killed me?

1923
02:01:02,402 --> 02:01:13,386
[SPEAKER_28]: That song in Guitar Hero 3 that used to kill me was the Muse song, the Knights of Cydonia I probably broke my guitar over that, I don't know how many times

1924
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:17,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, but that's an epic song in itself.

1925
02:01:17,403 --> 02:01:18,403
[SPEAKER_28]: It is a pretty epic song.

1926
02:01:18,823 --> 02:01:20,364
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we gotta let you go.

1927
02:01:21,085 --> 02:01:21,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Hurry up, hurry up.

1928
02:01:21,705 --> 02:01:22,305
[SPEAKER_28]: What's your last thought?

1929
02:01:23,926 --> 02:01:26,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... Oh god, no.

1930
02:01:27,548 --> 02:01:28,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, right.

1931
02:01:29,169 --> 02:01:35,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried, well, the War Puffer tried to activate a trial account, and it won't work.

1932
02:01:36,393 --> 02:01:36,793
[SPEAKER_27]: Why not?

1933
02:01:37,193 --> 02:01:38,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a little trial disk and everything.

1934
02:01:38,834 --> 02:01:39,394
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't work.

1935
02:01:39,434 --> 02:01:40,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what'd you do?

1936
02:01:40,795 --> 02:01:41,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't...

1937
02:01:42,665 --> 02:01:43,506
[SPEAKER_09]: You broke it!

1938
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:45,127
[SPEAKER_09]: You broke WoW!

1939
02:01:46,928 --> 02:01:48,428
[SPEAKER_28]: Call Blizzard, technical support.

1940
02:01:49,109 --> 02:01:55,392
[SPEAKER_14]: The trial accounts are so crippled because of people, spammers use trial accounts so they can spam without having to pay.

1941
02:01:55,772 --> 02:02:02,196
[SPEAKER_14]: So the accounts are so crippled, like when I played with a trial account like two years ago, I hated it because I couldn't do anything.

1942
02:02:02,636 --> 02:02:05,578
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when I actually paid for it, it's like, oh, this is a completely different game.

1943
02:02:06,978 --> 02:02:08,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it worth it for the $15?

1944
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've

1945
02:02:10,502 --> 02:02:11,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a wife.

1946
02:02:27,458 --> 02:02:30,940
[SPEAKER_09]: and I play other games other than just one.

1947
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,001
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I say this here real quickly about Warcraft?

1948
02:02:33,341 --> 02:02:43,527
[SPEAKER_28]: The reason why I play so much Warcraft is because of the social element and a lot of my friends play and it's so much fun to raid with them and stuff and it's always fun to meet new people too that are like you and stuff.

1949
02:02:43,587 --> 02:02:44,427
[SPEAKER_28]: First off, two things.

1950
02:02:45,148 --> 02:02:54,593
[SPEAKER_28]: Apparently this has suddenly turned into the Robin Allen Guild radio show because one of the guild members who I've never seen join chat before joined and said, what do you mean Alan has the best DPS?

1951
02:02:54,613 --> 02:02:56,034
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1952
02:02:57,174 --> 02:03:23,702
[SPEAKER_28]: I finally figured out because I've been watching the guild the old web series and I've finally figured out the whole some of the emphasis and some of the lingo the thing is she really did play WoW and that's why like that series is so spot on because I'm sure it's a lot like some of it is probably like you know obviously fiction like some of the weird dating storylines to get into but a lot of the stuff they talk about in game is so true

1953
02:03:26,139 --> 02:03:30,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what about the stuff in the South Park Make Love Not Warcraft episode?

1954
02:03:31,241 --> 02:03:56,152
[SPEAKER_28]: Mom, bathroom And this is I just got a screenshot from one of the guild members Who apparently, yes, in guild chat At 1.56am I'm assuming that's eastern time One of the guildies said That bitch ain't coming to raid tomorrow because he's going to get Pinkberry That fat bitch I just got a screenshot of somebody talking shit about me in guild Wow I know they're listening too If it's one something that would be central time

1955
02:03:57,452 --> 02:04:05,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, one of my girlfriends ended up breaking up with me via Wi-Fi connection on a live Metroid Time Hunters game where we could do voice chat.

1956
02:04:05,821 --> 02:04:06,642
[SPEAKER_09]: We had friend codes.

1957
02:04:07,142 --> 02:04:10,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone in the whole room heard it.

1958
02:04:11,186 --> 02:04:12,988
[SPEAKER_09]: And then my character died.

1959
02:04:13,889 --> 02:04:15,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just like, wow.

1960
02:04:16,372 --> 02:04:16,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Worst.

1961
02:04:17,185 --> 02:04:21,067
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically, it was because I was a gamer and so she

1962
02:04:45,871 --> 02:04:50,019
[SPEAKER_09]: She said, either you quit gaming or I dump you and get this.

1963
02:04:50,059 --> 02:04:55,810
[SPEAKER_09]: This girl was a cheerleader and freshman and I was kind of done with my life trying to find love.

1964
02:04:57,409 --> 02:04:59,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

1965
02:04:59,630 --> 02:04:59,990
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1966
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:13,820
[SPEAKER_28]: If there's one lesson we could teach you here on Orange Lounge Radio, look, I want all the young men to listen up because I know we have some strapping young lads that are, what, between 16 and 21 that listen to this show, young guys trying to find the girl of their dreams and so forth.

1967
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:21,925
[SPEAKER_28]: This is what I want to teach you, and JB, back me up on this, is that if a woman is going to break up with you because you play too many games, she's a bitch.

1968
02:05:22,385 --> 02:05:22,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1969
02:05:24,146 --> 02:05:26,068
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a bitch, and you can do better.

1970
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:31,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's... I'm dating a girl who knows more about anime than I do.

1971
02:05:31,271 --> 02:05:31,831
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

1972
02:05:31,851 --> 02:05:33,292
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, she's just a nerd.

1973
02:05:33,332 --> 02:05:33,992
[SPEAKER_28]: But that's okay.

1974
02:05:34,032 --> 02:05:34,673
[SPEAKER_28]: Nerds are okay.

1975
02:05:35,253 --> 02:05:35,553
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1976
02:05:36,033 --> 02:05:36,474
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, buddy.

1977
02:05:36,494 --> 02:05:37,194
[SPEAKER_28]: We're gonna let you go.

1978
02:05:37,234 --> 02:05:37,954
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one, buddy.

1979
02:05:38,735 --> 02:05:38,995
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1980
02:05:39,035 --> 02:05:39,535
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, later.

1981
02:05:41,416 --> 02:05:45,158
[SPEAKER_28]: There's one thing you could learn from Orange Laundry.

1982
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:48,920
[SPEAKER_28]: It's... I'm not saying if a girl doesn't play games, she's a bitch.

1983
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:52,723
[SPEAKER_28]: That's... But if a girl doesn't understand, you gotta respect the games.

1984
02:05:53,603 --> 02:05:54,083
[SPEAKER_28]: She's a bitch.

1985
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:23,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna get so much hate mail alright well I think I don't know if it's like honey get the keys the baby's coming now and it's like Festergut is at 20% the baby is harshing my mellow right now good news everybody the baby is coming hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this wait wait let me hear it straight did you say raid or rave cause I got my glow sticks here ready for tomorrow night

[SPEAKER_28]: Why not both?

1987
02:06:29,519 --> 02:06:31,220
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's rave during the raid.

1988
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:31,700
[SPEAKER_28]: Why not?

1989
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,021
[SPEAKER_24]: Light switch raid!

1990
02:06:33,661 --> 02:06:37,022
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you been trying to call us for 30 minutes just to make that joke?

1991
02:06:39,523 --> 02:06:44,824
[SPEAKER_24]: No, but it's not like you said raid or rave, so I had to call in just to say something about it.

1992
02:06:45,084 --> 02:06:45,525
[SPEAKER_28]: Raid.

1993
02:06:45,765 --> 02:06:46,525
[SPEAKER_28]: R-A-I-D.

1994
02:06:46,785 --> 02:06:48,145
[SPEAKER_28]: Use it to kill insects.

1995
02:06:48,746 --> 02:06:51,807
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, I know, but I just couldn't resist raid.

1996
02:06:52,387 --> 02:06:52,867
[SPEAKER_24]: Why not?

1997
02:06:53,527 --> 02:06:53,807
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright.

1998
02:06:54,328 --> 02:06:54,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye.

02:06:56,932 --> 02:06:57,092

[SPEAKER_28]: And then... Oh, yeah.

2004
02:07:52,629 --> 02:07:54,930
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta play the one you sent me or you're gonna throw a fit.

2005
02:07:55,631 --> 02:07:56,952
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually got an email from Jamie.

2006
02:07:56,972 --> 02:07:58,113
[SPEAKER_28]: This is play this, ho-bag.

2007
02:07:58,513 --> 02:07:59,514
[SPEAKER_28]: That was actually the subject.

2008
02:08:00,835 --> 02:08:01,976
[SPEAKER_28]: She's so respectful.

2009
02:08:03,717 --> 02:08:04,477
[SPEAKER_26]: So respectful.

2010
02:08:05,598 --> 02:08:05,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:08:06,699 --> 02:08:09,141
[SPEAKER_28]: Big thanks to those of you guys that have been listening the entire time.

02:08:09,201 --> 02:08:10,162
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I don't know how you do it.

2013
02:08:10,202 --> 02:08:10,962
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys are crazy.

2014
02:08:11,623 --> 02:08:13,064
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I can barely tolerate being here.

2015
02:08:13,624 --> 02:08:13,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2016
02:08:13,884 --> 02:08:15,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just leave it all in the other room.

2017
02:08:15,566 --> 02:08:15,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2018
02:08:15,846 --> 02:08:16,046

02:08:20,408 --> 02:08:22,089
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know what we're going to do in the next segment.

[SPEAKER_18]: That's why Dan's not in here.

2034
02:09:17,241 --> 02:09:19,282
[SPEAKER_18]: He's ignoring us in favor of video games.

2035
02:09:19,403 --> 02:09:19,843
[SPEAKER_28]: That's fine.

2036
02:09:20,123 --> 02:09:22,804
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we asked Dan to come play a match game, but he's like, I'm in the middle of a game.

2037
02:09:25,406 --> 02:09:25,726
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2038
02:09:26,146 --> 02:09:28,387
[SPEAKER_28]: How about more Facebook questions from earlier?

2039
02:09:28,947 --> 02:09:29,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do it, Rob.

2040
02:09:29,808 --> 02:09:30,348
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what?

2041
02:09:30,748 --> 02:09:31,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel energetic.

2042
02:09:32,452 --> 02:09:34,213
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like we could go longer

2043
02:09:52,664 --> 02:09:58,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I make mine with decaf, but decaf still has caffeine in it, except I make it kind of strong with a good scoop of Hershey's Cocoa in it.

2044
02:09:59,047 --> 02:10:08,171
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I add some Splenda and about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and use a soy creamer after I add the water.

2045
02:10:08,191 --> 02:10:12,773
[SPEAKER_18]: So it actually tastes like sort of intermediate chocolate.

2046
02:10:12,793 --> 02:10:13,574
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds so hippie.

2047
02:10:13,774 --> 02:10:14,414
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really good.

2048
02:10:14,554 --> 02:10:14,914
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2049
02:10:15,074 --> 02:10:15,795
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll take your word for it.

2050
02:10:16,075 --> 02:10:16,475
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you want some?

2051
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:17,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe later.

2052
02:10:17,835 --> 02:10:18,076
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

2053
02:10:18,336 --> 02:10:20,437
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not tired yet, but give me about another hour.

2054
02:10:20,457 --> 02:10:21,017
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see how we do.

2055
02:10:21,597 --> 02:10:23,377
[SPEAKER_28]: I say we beat 12 o'clock.

2056
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:26,178
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we've only got 45 minutes to go.

2057
02:10:26,718 --> 02:10:27,458
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll probably beat it.

2058
02:10:27,798 --> 02:10:28,319
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Bradley.

2059
02:10:28,479 --> 02:10:29,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Play some more Para.

2060
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:30,879
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to be doing a list list.

2061
02:10:31,579 --> 02:10:33,680
[SPEAKER_28]: It's cheating, though, if I play too much music.

2062
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:37,801
[SPEAKER_28]: Playing about 10 minutes every hour, that's okay, because we need to be able to take breaks and stuff like that.

2063
02:10:37,841 --> 02:10:39,261
[SPEAKER_28]: But if I play much more than that, we're cheating.

2064
02:10:40,601 --> 02:10:41,201
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, hi.

2065
02:10:41,421 --> 02:10:42,902
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to be doing a list list here shortly.

2066
02:10:42,962 --> 02:10:48,063
[SPEAKER_28]: Tonight's topic, if you want to start thinking about this, and I know Bradley's going to want to think about this because he needs to get his list together.

2067
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:54,067
[SPEAKER_28]: Thing I most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011

2068
02:10:59,466 --> 02:11:02,247
[SPEAKER_28]: It's going to be the topic tonight, so start thinking about that and get your list down.

2069
02:11:02,267 --> 02:11:05,187
[SPEAKER_28]: The thing I most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011.

2070
02:11:08,428 --> 02:11:11,929
[SPEAKER_28]: Meanwhile, more Facebook questions that we got earlier this week.

2071
02:11:12,989 --> 02:11:16,130
[SPEAKER_28]: We had Liam earlier ask us, what is our favorite video game of all time?

2072
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:16,770
[SPEAKER_28]: What about this?

2073
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:21,451
[SPEAKER_28]: John on Facebook asked a very similar question, not just what is the best video game ever...

2074
02:11:22,131 --> 02:11:25,594
[SPEAKER_28]: What is the worst video game ever?

2075
02:11:26,354 --> 02:11:30,917
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there a game that you can think of that would qualify as the worst video game ever?

2076
02:11:31,218 --> 02:11:31,778
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura.

2077
02:11:32,338 --> 02:11:40,624
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a game that was so bad that when Dan and I rented it we were horrified by it and called Blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back.

2078
02:11:42,086 --> 02:11:44,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was WCW Thunder.

2079
02:11:45,328 --> 02:11:45,868
[SPEAKER_28]: That bad, huh?

2080
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:47,069
[SPEAKER_18]: It was really that bad.

2081
02:11:47,790 --> 02:11:50,752
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, I actually kind of thought the Spice Girls game was bad.

2082
02:11:51,977 --> 02:11:53,478
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's so hilarious!

2083
02:11:53,498 --> 02:11:56,298
[SPEAKER_18]: It was hilarious, but it was kind of hard to play.

2084
02:11:56,879 --> 02:11:57,799
[SPEAKER_28]: It was awesome.

2085
02:11:58,699 --> 02:12:00,400
[SPEAKER_18]: And the American Blue Stinger was bad.

2086
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:01,960
[SPEAKER_18]: The Japanese one was cool.

2087
02:12:02,881 --> 02:12:03,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Worst game ever.

2088
02:12:03,761 --> 02:12:04,541
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, you got something?

2089
02:12:08,243 --> 02:12:11,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably that King's Quest Mask of Eternity game.

2090
02:12:11,824 --> 02:12:18,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I bought it the day it came out for full retail price, which was like 50 bucks, and it is hideously awful bad.

2091
02:12:19,767 --> 02:12:20,267
[SPEAKER_28]: Terra bad?

2092
02:12:20,387 --> 02:12:20,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Terra bad.

2093
02:12:23,374 --> 02:12:26,756
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I would, uh, what is the worst video game ever?

2094
02:12:26,836 --> 02:12:30,558
[SPEAKER_28]: Fusion Frenzy 2 is probably the worst video game.

2095
02:12:30,678 --> 02:12:30,999
[SPEAKER_28]: One of them.

2096
02:12:31,079 --> 02:12:31,679
[SPEAKER_28]: It's close.

2097
02:12:31,999 --> 02:12:34,941
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, that was that one I made you play on the 360 that was so, so bad.

2098
02:12:35,001 --> 02:12:37,382
[SPEAKER_28]: Like it was like Mario Party, but not fun at all.

2099
02:12:37,402 --> 02:12:42,425
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like when you had me play Yaris, I couldn't help it because I was laughing.

2100
02:12:42,565 --> 02:12:47,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just laugh, just laughter came out of me playing Yaris because it was so, what is this?

2101
02:12:47,528 --> 02:12:48,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not even.

2102
02:12:48,849 --> 02:12:50,230
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's, that's worth something.

2103
02:12:51,889 --> 02:13:18,084
[SPEAKER_28]: and BitBoy was really a special kind of terrible that I played earlier this year too that was really bad or last year and going like if I want to go way back I remember renting this game on the Nintendo Entertainment System and thinking it was just like the worst fucking game I'd ever played and I bet nobody's ever even heard of it it was a Color Dreams game they made the bootleg carts it was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who and I remember this game because it was so terrible

2104
02:13:19,205 --> 02:13:20,806
[SPEAKER_28]: I bet that's a game not even Jamie knows.

2105
02:13:20,846 --> 02:13:22,187
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, that's how obscure this shit is.

2106
02:13:22,207 --> 02:13:22,387
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2107
02:13:22,888 --> 02:13:23,068
[SPEAKER_28]: Huh?

2108
02:13:23,448 --> 02:13:23,948
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I've seen it.

2109
02:13:24,068 --> 02:13:24,389
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you?

2110
02:13:24,509 --> 02:13:25,049
[SPEAKER_28]: It's bad, huh?

2111
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:25,389
[SPEAKER_18]: It's bad.

2112
02:13:25,549 --> 02:13:26,090
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really bad.

2113
02:13:26,850 --> 02:13:28,311
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of those color dreams were really bad.

2114
02:13:28,471 --> 02:13:28,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2115
02:13:29,032 --> 02:13:29,252
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

2116
02:13:29,792 --> 02:13:30,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Good stuff.

2117
02:13:30,313 --> 02:13:32,294
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, any Terra bad games you can think of?

2118
02:13:33,155 --> 02:13:34,335
[SPEAKER_28]: Worst freaking video game?

2119
02:13:35,576 --> 02:13:41,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst, a lot of them that are really terrible are like these girl fighting games on like the Japanese Saturn ones.

2120
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:44,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was like Asuka 120% was one of them.

2121
02:13:44,082 --> 02:13:45,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was actually fun.

2122
02:13:46,323 --> 02:13:47,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of one of them.

2123
02:13:48,345 --> 02:13:52,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been a different one from that one, but usually they're slow and crappy moves and stuff.

2124
02:13:54,849 --> 02:13:57,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Other games were craptastic.

2125
02:13:58,612 --> 02:14:04,896
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, some of our chat room saying DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Assault was another Color Dreams game that was worse.

2126
02:14:05,516 --> 02:14:31,910
[SPEAKER_28]: GreenDragon says Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom The force you had to get through was a bigger pain in the ass than the Doom Dungeon Let's see Dash of Destruction, Yaris Kabuki Warriors says Amaze Satsuma was a really bad game SirDorksalot says the PS1 version of Samurai Shodown 3 was terrible There you go, those are some of the responses there from our chatroom More Facebook questions

2127
02:14:34,688 --> 02:14:39,290
[SPEAKER_28]: John on Facebook also asks the best geek moment ever.

2128
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:40,870
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a good one.

2129
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:43,111
[SPEAKER_28]: The best geek moment ever.

2130
02:14:43,171 --> 02:14:45,492
[SPEAKER_28]: What was your best geek moment ever?

2131
02:14:45,532 --> 02:14:46,412
[SPEAKER_28]: This is kind of tricky.

2132
02:14:47,172 --> 02:14:48,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, mine's easy.

2133
02:14:49,013 --> 02:14:52,454
[SPEAKER_18]: That's beating the dragon blindfolded in Mega Man 2.

2134
02:14:53,795 --> 02:14:54,635
[SPEAKER_28]: That is pretty geeky.

2135
02:14:55,197 --> 02:15:23,247
[SPEAKER_18]: and and uh doing you know doing Mario 8-1 blindfolded if if you know your rhythm it's not that hard but the dragon because and that one was also kind of precise timing too so I and I've only done it three times nice I can't do it now hell no but when when it was out yeah okay all right Alan do you have a best geek moment ever that you can think of

2136
02:15:24,983 --> 02:15:25,984
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2137
02:15:44,982 --> 02:15:47,784
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought though this year's E3 was like a close second.

2138
02:15:48,304 --> 02:15:51,146
[SPEAKER_28]: My first E3 was definitely my best, but this year's E3 was a close second.

2139
02:15:51,166 --> 02:15:52,427
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a really good E3 this year.

2140
02:15:53,267 --> 02:15:55,809
[SPEAKER_18]: What about though going to E3 for the first time as press?

2141
02:15:57,741 --> 02:16:06,769
[SPEAKER_28]: That was cool too, but I honestly didn't notice that huge of a difference because one thing I've learned about press is that if you don't book your show like six months in advance, then you're pretty much having the same show as everyone else.

2142
02:16:07,850 --> 02:16:13,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Plus back in 06 or 07, I don't remember what year we actually went as press, maybe it was 07.

2143
02:16:14,055 --> 02:16:17,898
[SPEAKER_18]: I booked us with Bethesda well in advance so we could get in for the Star Trek screening.

2144
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:20,441
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, which ended up being a mediocre game, which was too bad.

2145
02:16:20,641 --> 02:16:25,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and I got into... Though I got in one time as not as pressed, though, for a pressed thing for PabloCross.

2146
02:16:26,147 --> 02:16:26,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2147
02:16:27,268 --> 02:16:28,410
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry to steal your thunder.

2148
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:29,251
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, that's okay.

2149
02:16:29,791 --> 02:16:30,572
[SPEAKER_28]: But it was good.

2150
02:16:31,513 --> 02:16:34,757
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, there were some really good parties, depending on what year it was, you know.

2151
02:16:35,677 --> 02:16:57,655
[SPEAKER_28]: uh looking in our chat room and some of the questions uh questions here uh JV Mon says my best geek moment was meeting Matt Smith at the New York City premiere of Doctor Who series 5 and being on the 13th episode of Doctor Who Confidential uh Ranma says beating Mega Man 3 Dan Shadow says the parties at E3 were insane yep yep uh what was that place that we went and got beer at

2152
02:16:58,396 --> 02:17:02,081
[SPEAKER_18]: They had like 200 taps on the wall or something like that.

2153
02:17:02,561 --> 02:17:03,743
[SPEAKER_18]: That place was epic.

2154
02:17:03,843 --> 02:17:04,404
[SPEAKER_18]: That was Seattle.

2155
02:17:04,424 --> 02:17:05,686
[SPEAKER_28]: For PAX, that was epic.

2156
02:17:05,966 --> 02:17:07,549
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, maybe some people are there right now.

2157
02:17:07,629 --> 02:17:12,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Although, you know, I did enjoy my Facebook style photo with Jonathan Colton.

2158
02:17:12,155 --> 02:17:12,636
[SPEAKER_18]: That was pretty fun.

2159
02:17:17,992 --> 02:17:20,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got one, I've got one.

2160
02:17:20,474 --> 02:17:22,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of one.

2161
02:17:23,036 --> 02:17:24,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Anime Expo 2000.

2162
02:17:25,658 --> 02:17:27,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie says he remembers seeing me there.

2163
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:34,025
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my last day X. I actually stayed up all night at the DDR room.

2164
02:17:34,405 --> 02:17:40,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I only played it once there, but I was just there watching people because I was waiting for... They were having signings in the morning.

2165
02:17:40,470 --> 02:17:41,991
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the one at Disneyland, wasn't it?

2166
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it 2001 at Disneyland?

2167
02:17:44,013 --> 02:17:45,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Because then I was there for one after that.

2168
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:49,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember if that was a Long Beach one or a Disneyland one.

2169
02:17:49,831 --> 02:17:51,631
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it had to have been Long Beach.

2170
02:17:52,131 --> 02:17:54,352
[SPEAKER_18]: No, 2000 was the one at Disneyland.

2171
02:17:54,372 --> 02:17:55,992
[SPEAKER_18]: 2001 was in Long Beach.

2172
02:17:56,152 --> 02:17:57,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was at Anaheim.

2173
02:17:58,073 --> 02:18:00,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those long piers down there.

2174
02:18:00,233 --> 02:18:01,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We went down there and waited.

2175
02:18:02,734 --> 02:18:08,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, basically staying up all night watching people play DDR, waiting to get signatures from artists and stuff.

2176
02:18:09,784 --> 02:18:10,244
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

2177
02:18:30,973 --> 02:18:32,094
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the year of the chair.

2178
02:18:32,815 --> 02:18:34,156
[SPEAKER_28]: Here's some more geek moments from chat.

2179
02:18:34,196 --> 02:18:37,418
[SPEAKER_28]: GreenDragon says, biggest geek moment, speaking Klingon with my dad.

2180
02:18:37,798 --> 02:18:38,699
[SPEAKER_28]: Dude, your dad is cool.

2181
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:40,240
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

2182
02:18:41,802 --> 02:18:49,828
[SPEAKER_28]: Gilroy Spars, which I think is Nathan, says, being told about a weekend cabin retreat of drinking and massive D&D playing and being very excited about going.

2183
02:18:49,848 --> 02:18:50,809
[SPEAKER_28]: That does sound kind of awesome.

2184
02:18:51,129 --> 02:18:51,670
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2185
02:19:09,068 --> 02:19:15,610
[SPEAKER_18]: That pretty much means have a good year because Rosh Hashanah is this Wednesday night slash Thursday during the day.

2186
02:19:16,771 --> 02:19:20,492
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like I'm the translator of Jew speak tonight or something.

2187
02:19:20,912 --> 02:19:22,393
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just Hebrew, Rob.

2188
02:19:22,793 --> 02:19:23,793
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought of my geek moment.

2189
02:19:23,833 --> 02:19:25,214
[SPEAKER_28]: You thought of your geek moment, yay!

2190
02:19:26,674 --> 02:19:29,655
[SPEAKER_14]: When I was in D-Malay, which was the youth group that I was in.

2191
02:19:30,776 --> 02:19:31,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh boy.

2192
02:19:31,216 --> 02:19:33,136
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, I'm going to out myself.

2193
02:19:33,256 --> 02:19:33,917
[SPEAKER_28]: I was in it too.

2194
02:19:34,397 --> 02:19:37,478
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't talked about it a lot on the show because not a lot of kids were in it.

2195
02:19:38,058 --> 02:19:40,259
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, it's youth masonry, right?

2196
02:19:40,319 --> 02:19:43,240
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like not a lot of... The Shriners and the Masons before their son.

2197
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:48,222
[SPEAKER_28]: Usually if your grandpa's in it, or in my case, you end up being in it, or you have friends that were in it or what have you.

2198
02:19:48,722 --> 02:19:55,945
[SPEAKER_28]: But the reason why I bring this up before he says this is because Alan and I were both in this organization.

2199
02:19:56,326 --> 02:19:58,266
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're convinced that we met each other when we were 15.

2200
02:19:58,306 --> 02:19:58,987
[SPEAKER_28]: We met each other at camp.

2201
02:19:59,287 --> 02:20:01,548
[SPEAKER_28]: Like at camp, at the leadership camp or whatever.

2202
02:20:01,948 --> 02:20:06,890
[SPEAKER_28]: Like we're convinced we met each other and just didn't like, you know, we weren't really...

2203
02:20:07,762 --> 02:20:09,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Nintendo Super Nintendo Super Nintendo

2204
02:20:23,461 --> 02:20:42,245
[SPEAKER_14]: At the convention, which is basically like four days of a bunch of 15-year-old boys just staying up and doing convention things, I think we hooked up a Super NES up to our hotel TV room, and we played, I think we played Rock and Roll Racing and Street Fighter II, I think for like 36 hours without sleeping.

2205
02:20:42,605 --> 02:20:43,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

2206
02:20:43,885 --> 02:20:45,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is something that you can only do when you're 15.

2207
02:20:45,545 --> 02:20:48,226
[SPEAKER_18]: I beg to differ.

2208
02:20:48,506 --> 02:20:49,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh.

2209
02:20:50,553 --> 02:20:51,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I beg to differ.

2210
02:20:51,994 --> 02:21:14,975
[SPEAKER_18]: When I, it was probably my, I'd have to say my second year of college or my first year, somewhere around there, I was working in the game room and so I brought in my TV and my Super Nintendo and my friend brought in his import Saturn and we had gaming going on in the pool hall all night and I ran D&D games and we did this three nights in a row and I did not sleep and on the fourth day of having been awake,

2211
02:21:16,075 --> 02:21:26,281
[SPEAKER_18]: I sit down at my friend's dorm room and lean back on the cushions while they're playing whatever I think it was Doom at the time and wake up in my own dorm bed.

2212
02:21:27,682 --> 02:21:28,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, so they carried you.

2213
02:21:28,823 --> 02:21:29,963
[SPEAKER_18]: They carried me to my dorm room.

2214
02:21:30,024 --> 02:21:30,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't remember any of it.

2215
02:21:30,904 --> 02:21:31,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't remember.

2216
02:21:32,345 --> 02:21:32,505
[SPEAKER_18]: But...

2217
02:21:34,423 --> 02:21:43,528
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, but the best dorm slash frat house story that you possibly have was when you missed this show because you were in San Diego one weekend and you stayed at the gay frat house.

2218
02:21:43,548 --> 02:21:45,309
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you tell this story again on the show real quick?

2219
02:21:45,329 --> 02:21:46,030
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, God, right.

2220
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:46,850
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been years.

2221
02:21:48,131 --> 02:21:52,674
[SPEAKER_18]: I went with Julie to San Diego to see some friends of ours.

2222
02:21:54,095 --> 02:21:56,576
[SPEAKER_18]: One of them lives in Japan right now and the other one lives somewhere.

2223
02:21:56,596 --> 02:21:57,677
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2224
02:22:17,333 --> 02:22:20,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the only place that we had to stay was the gay frat house.

2225
02:22:21,195 --> 02:22:21,975
[SPEAKER_18]: To stay with our friend.

2226
02:22:22,035 --> 02:22:23,776
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, your friend was a gay frat boy.

2227
02:22:23,916 --> 02:22:24,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2228
02:22:24,856 --> 02:22:25,697
[SPEAKER_18]: He lived in the frat house.

2229
02:22:26,197 --> 02:22:29,638
[SPEAKER_18]: So the only spaces, like Julie slept on, I think, on some couch.

2230
02:22:30,179 --> 02:22:33,880
[SPEAKER_18]: And I slept in a little room under the stairs where there had been a mattress.

2231
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,662
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the Harry Potter room.

2232
02:22:36,682 --> 02:22:38,222
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what it called it, the Harry Potter room.

2233
02:22:39,083 --> 02:22:42,124
[SPEAKER_18]: And it had a little light in there all on its own and everything.

2234
02:22:42,144 --> 02:22:42,864
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually kind of neat.

2235
02:22:43,565 --> 02:22:46,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very, very glad they washed the mattress before I used it.

2236
02:22:47,307 --> 02:22:51,653
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I was just like, think about all the handjobs that have taken place in that little closet.

2237
02:22:51,673 --> 02:22:52,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Bro, I'm so drunk, bro.

2238
02:22:53,635 --> 02:22:54,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Bro, where we at, bro?

2239
02:22:58,177 --> 02:23:00,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I slept in the Harry Potter room, Rob!

2240
02:23:25,431 --> 02:23:27,312
[SPEAKER_18]: I read Harry Potter in the Harry Potter room!

2241
02:23:29,673 --> 02:23:32,374
[SPEAKER_28]: And I was like, wait, there's gay frat houses?

2242
02:23:32,514 --> 02:23:34,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I didn't even know they existed at that time.

2243
02:23:34,275 --> 02:23:35,395
[SPEAKER_18]: There's like a national gay fraternity.

2244
02:23:35,415 --> 02:23:38,996
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I know that now, but like ten years ago I didn't, or however long ago that was.

2245
02:23:40,257 --> 02:23:41,898
[SPEAKER_18]: All that long time ago, oh no.

2246
02:23:42,238 --> 02:23:42,838
[SPEAKER_28]: Been a long time.

2247
02:23:43,578 --> 02:23:43,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2248
02:23:45,659 --> 02:23:48,260
[SPEAKER_28]: Red Entertainment is following up saying, bro, don't stop doing that.

2249
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:53,082
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to get something else to drink.

2250
02:23:53,959 --> 02:23:55,240
[SPEAKER_28]: Best and Worst Game Tie-Ins

2251
02:24:18,521 --> 02:24:23,144
[SPEAKER_28]: I think honestly the best as far as movies and all that go, the Silent Hill movie was pretty kickass.

2252
02:24:23,345 --> 02:24:29,029
[SPEAKER_28]: Even though it wasn't perfect, it was still miles above anything else that I think has come out to this point.

2253
02:24:29,109 --> 02:24:31,650
[SPEAKER_28]: So the Silent Hill movie is probably one of the best.

2254
02:24:32,591 --> 02:24:33,952
[SPEAKER_28]: As far as the worst...

2255
02:24:35,353 --> 02:24:36,974
[SPEAKER_28]: That Maniac Mansion shows up there.

2256
02:24:37,294 --> 02:24:38,095
[SPEAKER_28]: That was pretty bad.

2257
02:24:38,255 --> 02:24:42,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Or maybe the Pac-Man cartoon in the 80s was not that great either.

2258
02:24:42,398 --> 02:24:45,660
[SPEAKER_28]: It really didn't work for me.

2259
02:24:45,860 --> 02:24:46,200
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

2260
02:24:46,901 --> 02:24:49,703
[SPEAKER_28]: The best and the worst video game tie-ins, DarkSakura.

2261
02:24:49,743 --> 02:24:50,663
[SPEAKER_28]: Like movie, TV.

2262
02:24:51,344 --> 02:24:52,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Best was Silent Hill.

2263
02:24:52,885 --> 02:24:53,685
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to agree with you there.

2264
02:24:54,086 --> 02:24:57,208
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know how many times I watched it and I bought it on Blu-ray because I'm a fucking addict.

2265
02:24:58,369 --> 02:25:01,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Saw it four times in the theater.

2266
02:25:01,911 --> 02:25:02,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Worst...

2267
02:25:04,338 --> 02:25:10,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Captain N because the characterizations in that were just so awful.

2268
02:25:10,341 --> 02:25:11,102
[SPEAKER_18]: They were hideous.

2269
02:25:12,343 --> 02:25:18,506
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also have to say the Street Fighter movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

2270
02:25:19,307 --> 02:25:21,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Poor Raul Julia having that as his last movie.

2271
02:25:22,749 --> 02:25:23,729
[SPEAKER_18]: But Kali Minow was hot.

2272
02:25:28,698 --> 02:25:48,850
[SPEAKER_14]: any uh alan about uh captain n yeah you brought it up i love that show now when i think back on it why did kid icarus always suffix everything he said with icus like that was his speech impediment what was that well and megaman was always mega this mega that and simon belmont was an idiot and he was supposed to be like this courageous vampire hunter

2273
02:25:50,458 --> 02:25:50,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2274
02:25:51,178 --> 02:25:51,598
[SPEAKER_14]: IDK.

2275
02:25:52,039 --> 02:25:52,419
[SPEAKER_14]: IDK.

2276
02:25:52,759 --> 02:25:54,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Best video game tie-in?

2277
02:25:54,239 --> 02:25:54,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Mario Bros.

2278
02:25:55,019 --> 02:25:55,400
[SPEAKER_14]: cereal.

2279
02:25:57,220 --> 02:25:58,060
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you like food.

2280
02:25:58,381 --> 02:25:58,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2281
02:25:58,821 --> 02:26:02,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I would eat all... That's funny.

2282
02:26:02,622 --> 02:26:02,702
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2283
02:26:03,542 --> 02:26:07,423
[SPEAKER_14]: I would pick out all the marshmallows and then eat... Save the dry cereal for later.

2284
02:26:08,084 --> 02:26:12,185
[SPEAKER_14]: The one... Whatever Nintendo cereal had the two sides, it was like two bags in one box.

2285
02:26:12,685 --> 02:26:13,105
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I remember.

2286
02:26:13,125 --> 02:26:14,226
[SPEAKER_27]: The Nintendo breakfast system.

2287
02:26:14,246 --> 02:26:15,366
[SPEAKER_14]: The Nintendo cereal system, yeah.

2288
02:26:15,486 --> 02:26:15,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2289
02:26:16,106 --> 02:26:16,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that.

2290
02:26:17,507 --> 02:26:18,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Worst...

2291
02:26:23,898 --> 02:26:24,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I had one, I blanked.

2292
02:26:25,238 --> 02:26:25,599
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh-oh.

2293
02:26:25,759 --> 02:26:26,099
[SPEAKER_28]: Tired.

2294
02:26:26,179 --> 02:26:27,759
[SPEAKER_28]: Live radio.

2295
02:26:27,799 --> 02:26:28,500
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I'm yawning.

2296
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:29,940
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't even gotten to the games yet.

2297
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:31,821
[SPEAKER_28]: We gotta get to that segment pretty soon.

2298
02:26:31,981 --> 02:26:33,141
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, let me know if you think about it, okay?

2299
02:26:33,181 --> 02:26:34,862
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, I don't know if you have anything you're thinking of?

2300
02:26:35,782 --> 02:26:37,162
[SPEAKER_28]: Best and worst video game tie-ins?

2301
02:26:37,602 --> 02:26:38,543
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't really think of anything.

2302
02:26:39,763 --> 02:26:44,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Amy and all of the marketing related to Dante's Inferno last year.

2303
02:26:44,385 --> 02:26:47,546
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the worst video game tie-ins ever.

2304
02:26:47,826 --> 02:26:49,626
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, what was so terrible about it, do I ask?

2305
02:26:49,746 --> 02:26:52,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, see what you can get away with with a booth babe.

2306
02:26:53,187 --> 02:27:00,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe tied for God of War 2 when they served a goat or something at the press conference and they had the girls in the togas.

2307
02:27:00,970 --> 02:27:02,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, it was a fake animal.

2308
02:27:02,830 --> 02:27:05,351
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're like, oh yeah, we have a dead goat for God of War 2.

2309
02:27:05,891 --> 02:27:08,512
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's dumb and you're a bad person for thinking of it.

2310
02:27:10,256 --> 02:27:13,619
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, Sony just, in general, has a lot of really bad tie-ins.

2311
02:27:13,639 --> 02:27:17,363
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, sometimes they do really well, like the Kevin Butler stuff, but sometimes they do really bad.

2312
02:27:17,403 --> 02:27:18,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, remember the black and white PSP?

2313
02:27:19,065 --> 02:27:21,287
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, that was not good.

2314
02:27:21,727 --> 02:27:23,769
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, you just feel second-hand embarrassment for them, right?

2315
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:26,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Or the PSP commercial with the squirrels.

2316
02:27:26,972 --> 02:27:27,192
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

2317
02:27:28,374 --> 02:27:28,634
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2318
02:27:29,354 --> 02:27:31,276
[SPEAKER_28]: How about a game to perk us up, everybody?

2319
02:27:31,316 --> 02:27:32,478
[SPEAKER_28]: How about an OLR game?

2320
02:27:32,498 --> 02:27:32,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

2321
02:27:39,207 --> 02:27:39,648
[SPEAKER_28]: LISTLESS

2322
02:27:56,605 --> 02:28:00,108
[SPEAKER_28]: So the way this works, we're going to put together a definitive list.

2323
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:04,332
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to go around and get the top three answers on the list from each person here in studio.

2324
02:28:04,372 --> 02:28:05,233
[SPEAKER_28]: So we have a top 12.

2325
02:28:06,194 --> 02:28:10,577
[SPEAKER_28]: But then we go around the room and ask, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2326
02:28:10,998 --> 02:28:14,961
[SPEAKER_28]: And we reduce down to the top eight, which then you, our chat room, vote.

2327
02:28:15,602 --> 02:28:17,964
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'll come up with the definitive list.

02:28:18,024 --> 02:28:19,805
[SPEAKER_28]: And tonight we've got a great topic for you guys.

02:28:59,113 --> 02:29:00,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually playing games while we broadcast over the web.

2336
02:29:07,268 --> 02:29:09,129
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually playing games while we broadcast.

[SPEAKER_28]: I think our next marathon should be on New Year's.

2357
02:29:58,210 --> 02:30:00,113
[SPEAKER_20]: What sorts of uninterrupted classes would he sing?

2358

[SPEAKER_28]: My number three answer is corporate sponsorship.

2365
02:30:32,955 --> 02:30:34,817
[SPEAKER_28]: Because I will sell out like that.

2366
02:30:34,957 --> 02:30:36,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, very practical.

2367
02:30:36,098 --> 02:30:37,380
[SPEAKER_28]: Corporate sponsorship.

2368
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:41,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Hour 19 of the OLR Marathon brought to us tonight by Cinnabon.

2369
02:30:46,981 --> 02:30:47,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I like sugar!

2370
02:30:48,061 --> 02:30:49,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Every now and then we have a delicious Cinnabon.

2371
02:30:52,265 --> 02:31:04,275
[SPEAKER_28]: And my left arm is tingling and I don't know why, but... Who was that you were talking about once and it was like a, I don't know, it was like some really dumpy actress or something that was a total slut and you said, ah, she looks like she's been glazed up like a Cinnabon.

2372
02:31:04,295 --> 02:31:05,797
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

2373
02:31:06,517 --> 02:31:07,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Who was that?

2374
02:31:07,038 --> 02:31:08,180
[SPEAKER_28]: Were you talking about one of our friends?

2375
02:31:08,340 --> 02:31:08,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2376
02:31:08,961 --> 02:31:09,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

2377
02:31:10,623 --> 02:31:11,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2378
02:31:11,684 --> 02:31:13,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we really want to go there right now?

2379
02:31:13,586 --> 02:31:14,087
[SPEAKER_14]: We can.

2380
02:31:14,227 --> 02:31:14,608
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2381
02:31:14,648 --> 02:31:19,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, she was in her hotel room with her boyfriend and I said she's getting... Oh, yeah.

2382
02:31:19,254 --> 02:31:19,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

2383
02:31:19,955 --> 02:31:24,160
[SPEAKER_14]: She's getting frosted up like a Cinnabon right now because I'm gross like that.

2384
02:31:25,161 --> 02:31:25,861
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, here's the thing.

2385
02:31:26,201 --> 02:31:26,802
[SPEAKER_28]: No, seriously.

2386
02:31:27,082 --> 02:31:28,982
[SPEAKER_28]: We were in Reno and we were gambling.

2387
02:31:29,022 --> 02:31:33,684
[SPEAKER_28]: We were downstairs because they have a queen slot machine, which is the most amazing invention ever made.

2388
02:31:33,704 --> 02:31:34,544
[SPEAKER_28]: Like the band.

2389
02:31:34,584 --> 02:31:36,525
[SPEAKER_28]: Like the band, not like, you know, hey girl.

2390
02:31:36,885 --> 02:31:39,906
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, it was a queen slot machine with Freddie Mercury, right?

2391
02:31:40,306 --> 02:31:44,848
[SPEAKER_28]: But Alan and I went upstairs because Alan was kind of sick and I wanted to set some stuff down.

2392
02:31:45,128 --> 02:31:46,188
[SPEAKER_28]: We're like, we'll be right back.

2393
02:31:46,628 --> 02:31:50,250
[SPEAKER_28]: We get back downstairs and my friend's gone.

2394
02:31:50,330 --> 02:31:51,310
[SPEAKER_28]: Her and her boyfriend are gone.

2395
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:52,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Answer number two.

2396
02:32:20,118 --> 02:32:20,659
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.

2397
02:32:21,759 --> 02:32:22,540
[SPEAKER_18]: The Dan-a-thon.

2398
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,061
[SPEAKER_28]: The Dan-a-thon.

2399
02:32:24,701 --> 02:32:26,522
[SPEAKER_28]: Dan's been ignoring the show mostly tonight.

2400
02:32:26,963 --> 02:32:27,923
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah!

2401
02:32:28,464 --> 02:32:29,704
[SPEAKER_28]: Bastard!

2402
02:32:30,085 --> 02:32:32,486
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought we would need him to get through the show.

2403
02:32:32,546 --> 02:32:33,487
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't needed him.

2404
02:32:34,307 --> 02:32:36,849
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm very proud that we've gotten through this all by our lonesome selves.

2405
02:32:37,049 --> 02:32:37,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Relatively Dan-free.

2406
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:38,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty nice.

2407
02:32:39,250 --> 02:32:41,052
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2408
02:32:41,692 --> 02:32:42,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

2409
02:32:42,292 --> 02:32:42,793
[SPEAKER_28]: Next up.

2410
02:32:43,493 --> 02:32:44,654
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, your number two answer.

2411
02:32:44,974 --> 02:32:45,875
[SPEAKER_03]: A laser light show.

2412
02:32:46,595 --> 02:32:47,776
[SPEAKER_28]: A laser light show.

2413
02:32:47,816 --> 02:32:48,797
[SPEAKER_28]: I could do a light switch rave.

2414
02:32:48,837 --> 02:32:49,257
[SPEAKER_28]: Will that help?

2415
02:32:51,129 --> 02:32:53,009
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know how that translates to radio.

2416
02:32:54,630 --> 02:32:55,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares about the listeners?

2417
02:32:55,610 --> 02:32:57,370
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right, who cares about the listeners?

2418
02:33:01,271 --> 02:33:07,152
[SPEAKER_14]: We put on Pink Floyd's The Wall and it's like... Oh, it just all makes sense now.

2419
02:33:07,292 --> 02:33:10,553
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, when I watch The Wizard of Oz, it has a whole new meaning.

2420
02:33:10,573 --> 02:33:16,334
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, um... Alan, your number two pick for thing you most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011?

2421
02:33:16,534 --> 02:33:20,795
[SPEAKER_14]: A live web stream of booty poppin' go-go dancers in 8-bit cosplay.

2422
02:33:23,825 --> 02:33:25,467
[SPEAKER_28]: Slow that down and say it one more time.

2423
02:33:26,107 --> 02:33:32,233
[SPEAKER_14]: A live web stream of accompanying go-go dancing people in 8-bit cosplay.

2424
02:33:34,836 --> 02:33:35,817
[SPEAKER_28]: Any particular reason why?

2425
02:33:36,597 --> 02:33:40,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we've been doing this for 10 hours and I'm delirious right now.

2426
02:33:41,122 --> 02:33:41,482
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2427
02:33:41,522 --> 02:33:42,883
[SPEAKER_28]: My ideas are going to be kind of whack.

2428
02:33:42,984 --> 02:33:43,204
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2429
02:33:43,244 --> 02:33:44,265
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, that's all right.

2430
02:33:44,737 --> 02:33:47,698
[SPEAKER_28]: My number two answer is somewhat similar, actually.

2431
02:33:47,758 --> 02:33:50,500
[SPEAKER_28]: Thing I most want to see on the OLR Marathon 2011?

2432
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:51,960
[SPEAKER_28]: Nudity!

2433
02:33:53,281 --> 02:33:53,981
[SPEAKER_28]: But not from the hosts.

2434
02:33:55,482 --> 02:34:00,004
[SPEAKER_28]: So the thing I most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011 is nudity, but not from the hosts.

2435
02:34:01,665 --> 02:34:02,625
[SPEAKER_28]: We should hire a stripper.

2436
02:34:04,546 --> 02:34:06,287
[SPEAKER_28]: For the next... Oh, I should have put that down.

2437
02:34:09,599 --> 02:34:10,880
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, what is your number one answer?

2438
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:11,500
[SPEAKER_28]: Showgirls Edition

2439
02:34:39,192 --> 02:34:40,513
[SPEAKER_28]: How does Showgirls Edition work?

2440
02:34:40,573 --> 02:34:41,493
[SPEAKER_28]: You are a whore, darling.

2441
02:34:42,874 --> 02:34:47,157
[SPEAKER_18]: The whole thing is just us answering questions in Showgirls quotes.

2442
02:34:47,837 --> 02:34:48,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

2443
02:34:48,518 --> 02:34:51,039
[SPEAKER_18]: And with a topless dance show.

2444
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, you're stealing my answer.

2445
02:34:53,881 --> 02:34:54,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaming ain't fucking.

2446
02:34:55,202 --> 02:34:55,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2447
02:35:01,246 --> 02:35:05,028
[SPEAKER_28]: So many of our listeners have never seen Showgirls and can't appreciate the humor of that line.

2448
02:35:06,644 --> 02:35:17,899
[SPEAKER_28]: Episode 380 of Orange Lounge Radio Gaming ain't fucking Bradley, what is your number one answer for thing you most want to see of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon 2011?

2449
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:21,184
[SPEAKER_28]: Big money, big prizes

2450
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:26,001
[SPEAKER_28]: I love it!

2451
02:35:26,141 --> 02:35:28,082
[SPEAKER_28]: Big money, big prizes.

2452
02:35:28,222 --> 02:35:30,722
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know where that money's going to come from, but okay.

2453
02:35:30,882 --> 02:35:32,182
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, it's our dream world.

2454
02:35:33,263 --> 02:35:38,544
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, your number one answer for the thing you most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011.

2455
02:35:39,524 --> 02:35:44,765
[SPEAKER_14]: No one is allowed to switch to their next story or segment until they can beat the next level of Battletoads.

2456
02:35:48,306 --> 02:35:50,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of dead air on that marathon.

2457
02:35:55,073 --> 02:35:58,154
[SPEAKER_28]: No one is allowed to switch story until Beat Battletoads level.

2458
02:35:58,334 --> 02:35:58,634
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

2459
02:35:58,674 --> 02:35:59,775
[SPEAKER_28]: I just had to shorten it somehow.

2460
02:36:00,515 --> 02:36:04,056
[SPEAKER_28]: That's going to be very tricky, and there'll be a lot of cursing, actually.

2461
02:36:04,096 --> 02:36:04,796
[SPEAKER_28]: That's going to be tough.

2462
02:36:05,176 --> 02:36:05,457
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2463
02:36:06,237 --> 02:36:09,638
[SPEAKER_28]: My number one answer for thing I most want to see at the OLR Marathon 2011.

2464
02:36:11,018 --> 02:36:16,180
[SPEAKER_28]: Gabe and Tycho show up and exclaim, this is where the real party's at, bitches.

2465
02:36:17,541 --> 02:36:18,041
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2466
02:36:18,061 --> 02:36:18,981
[SPEAKER_28]: How do you like that, huh?

2467
02:36:20,241 --> 02:36:21,842
[SPEAKER_28]: This joke's on Penny Arcade Expo.

2468
02:36:25,808 --> 02:36:26,828
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so there it is.

2469
02:36:26,948 --> 02:36:29,109

02:36:50,677 --> 02:36:51,457
[SPEAKER_28]: They have to say bitches.

2472
02:36:52,898 --> 02:36:56,099
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2473
02:36:56,219 --> 02:36:57,560
[SPEAKER_28]: One of them is about to be eliminated.

2474
02:36:57,620 --> 02:36:58,820
[SPEAKER_28]: The chatters cannot vote on that.

2475
02:36:59,161 --> 02:37:01,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, let me read quickly while you think about that.

2476
02:37:01,362 --> 02:37:05,624
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to actually read some of the suggestions from chat because they have some good ones once in a while.

2477
02:37:07,365 --> 02:37:08,325
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm getting private tells.

2478
02:37:08,705 --> 02:37:10,326
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me on and I will strip for the show.

2479
02:37:12,167 --> 02:37:12,707
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

2480
02:37:14,868 --> 02:37:16,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Showgirls is an amazing movie.

2481
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:18,450
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

2482
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:20,371
[SPEAKER_28]: Took you this long to get to the stripper?

2483
02:37:21,652 --> 02:37:23,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Laser, Lady Gaga.

2484
02:37:23,553 --> 02:37:25,133
[SPEAKER_28]: Lady Gaga would be awesome.

2485
02:37:25,634 --> 02:37:27,315
[SPEAKER_28]: OLR, the musical episode.

2486
02:37:27,875 --> 02:37:28,415
[SPEAKER_28]: LARPing.

2487
02:37:28,756 --> 02:37:29,896
[SPEAKER_28]: Put LARPing on the list.

2488
02:37:29,936 --> 02:37:31,557
[SPEAKER_28]: We could do LARPing the whole episode.

2489
02:37:32,638 --> 02:37:37,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki reads every line ever used by Tingle in all the Zelda games, including Japanese and Tingle's voice.

2490
02:37:39,061 --> 02:37:39,822
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

2491
02:37:40,582 --> 02:37:41,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I just go ahead and pick something?

2492
02:37:41,703 --> 02:37:42,123
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, all right.

2493
02:37:42,143 --> 02:37:43,484
[SPEAKER_28]: Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

2494
02:37:44,584 --> 02:37:44,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Nudity.

2495
02:37:44,845 --> 02:37:45,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Nudity.

2496
02:37:46,772 --> 02:37:47,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Nudity?

2497
02:37:47,513 --> 02:37:48,934
[SPEAKER_18]: How could you eliminate nudity?

2498
02:37:49,214 --> 02:37:51,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we can just get that on the internet anyway.

2499
02:37:51,356 --> 02:37:51,896
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess that's true.

2500
02:37:52,236 --> 02:37:54,418
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, nudity is stricken from the list.

2501
02:37:54,858 --> 02:37:56,960
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2502
02:37:57,661 --> 02:37:58,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Corporate sponsorship.

2503
02:37:59,062 --> 02:38:02,064
[SPEAKER_27]: You'd never... Alright, why?

2504
02:38:02,685 --> 02:38:05,847
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it just wouldn't be LLR without sponsorship.

2505
02:38:06,007 --> 02:38:06,968
[SPEAKER_28]: That's true, that's true.

2506
02:38:07,008 --> 02:38:08,609
[SPEAKER_28]: If we sell out, it's just not the same.

2507
02:38:08,790 --> 02:38:10,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, I'll support you on that.

2508
02:38:10,831 --> 02:38:12,032
[SPEAKER_28]: It is stricken from the list.

2509
02:38:12,272 --> 02:38:13,994
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, which of these is not worthy from the list?

[SPEAKER_28]: The Dan-a-thon.

2512
02:38:45,364 --> 02:38:46,749
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, Alan took Dan off the list.

2513
02:38:46,889 --> 02:38:47,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh-oh.

2514
02:38:47,150 --> 02:38:47,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2515
02:38:49,158 --> 02:38:50,362
[SPEAKER_28]: Why'd you eliminate the Dan-a-thon?

2516
02:38:51,636 --> 02:38:52,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

2517
02:39:14,287 --> 02:39:15,068
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to take off.

2518
02:39:15,168 --> 02:39:15,968
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, Jamie.

2519
02:39:16,028 --> 02:39:18,910
[SPEAKER_28]: I love this answer, but showgirls edition just isn't going to work for me.

2520
02:39:18,970 --> 02:39:19,431
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

2521
02:39:19,831 --> 02:39:20,992
[SPEAKER_28]: Darling, you are a whore.

2522
02:39:21,192 --> 02:39:22,113
[SPEAKER_28]: You're a whore, darling.

2523
02:39:22,213 --> 02:39:22,453
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2524
02:39:23,314 --> 02:39:24,434
[SPEAKER_28]: It is stricken from the list.

2525
02:39:24,715 --> 02:39:25,415
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't know me.

2526
02:39:25,435 --> 02:39:26,496
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2527
02:39:26,536 --> 02:39:30,138
[SPEAKER_28]: So that leaves actually playing games on video.

2528
02:39:30,979 --> 02:39:44,653
[SPEAKER_28]: Balloon Drop, Loki Sings Hours of Disco, Laser Light Show, Livestream of GoGoDancing and 8-Bit Cosplay, Big Money, Big Prizes, No One is Allowed to Switch Stories Until Battletoads is Beaten, and Gabe and Tycho Show Up.

2529
02:39:45,253 --> 02:39:53,642
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so you're going to place a vote over Private Message to Sky in the chatroom with your number one and number two answers, and then we'll tally them all up.

2530
02:39:53,962 --> 02:39:54,902
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta type this out.

2531
02:39:55,342 --> 02:39:58,863
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we will tell you what won.

2532
02:39:58,943 --> 02:39:59,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Not our favorites.

2533
02:39:59,663 --> 02:40:00,043
[SPEAKER_28]: It doesn't matter.

2534
02:40:00,063 --> 02:40:01,144
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not in our hands anymore.

2535
02:40:01,164 --> 02:40:02,804
[SPEAKER_28]: It's in the hands of the listeners.

2536
02:40:02,884 --> 02:40:03,324
[SPEAKER_28]: The voters.

2537
02:40:03,944 --> 02:40:04,364
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

2538
02:40:05,565 --> 02:40:07,085
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to do match game very soon.

2539
02:40:08,625 --> 02:40:08,965
[SPEAKER_18]: You know.

2540
02:40:11,246 --> 02:40:14,967
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if we don't, Happy Bunny will be sad.

2541
02:40:16,307 --> 02:40:16,607
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2542
02:40:17,864 --> 02:40:18,384
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

2543
02:40:19,464 --> 02:40:21,965
[SPEAKER_28]: Now we have to fill time while I wait for votes to come in.

2544
02:40:22,005 --> 02:40:22,845
[SPEAKER_28]: How are we going to do that?

2545
02:40:23,906 --> 02:40:27,106
[SPEAKER_28]: Usually I'd be doing, I don't know, like freaking phone calls or something.

2546
02:40:27,126 --> 02:40:28,027
[SPEAKER_28]: Should I open up the skyline?

2547
02:40:28,107 --> 02:40:28,707
[SPEAKER_28]: Open up the skyline.

2548
02:40:30,067 --> 02:40:30,447
[SPEAKER_28]: Why not?

2549
02:40:30,527 --> 02:40:30,867
[SPEAKER_28]: Do it.

2550
02:40:31,147 --> 02:40:31,828
[SPEAKER_28]: It's almost midnight.

2551
02:40:32,788 --> 02:40:34,928
[SPEAKER_28]: Just want to point out, we're almost to our 10th hour of doing this.

2552
02:40:36,329 --> 02:40:36,929
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm getting crazy.

2553
02:40:38,371 --> 02:40:42,595
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, did you realize what you were signing up for when you were like, sure, Rob, I'll come be on the marathon show with you?

2554
02:40:42,916 --> 02:40:43,296
[SPEAKER_28]: That's good.

2555
02:40:43,496 --> 02:40:43,917
[SPEAKER_28]: You having fun?

2556
02:40:44,037 --> 02:40:44,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2557
02:40:44,777 --> 02:40:44,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Good.

2558
02:40:45,058 --> 02:40:45,678
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad you're having fun.

2559
02:40:45,979 --> 02:40:46,940
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad somebody's having fun.

2560
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:48,221
All right.

2561
02:40:48,241 --> 02:40:48,641
[SPEAKER_28]: Just kidding.

2562
02:40:49,062 --> 02:40:49,342
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2563
02:40:49,382 --> 02:40:51,404
[SPEAKER_28]: We open up the Skype line and see if we get any calls.

2564
02:40:52,385 --> 02:40:56,169
[SPEAKER_28]: You're going to have to talk to whoever calls in, though, because I've got to tally up the votes.

2565
02:40:56,189 --> 02:40:59,892
[SPEAKER_28]: So 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2566
02:41:00,373 --> 02:41:02,155
[SPEAKER_28]: We are open to take some more calls here.

2567
02:41:02,782 --> 02:41:03,942
[SPEAKER_14]: We could play silly YouTubes.

2568
02:41:04,022 --> 02:41:05,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Did we get a call in?

2569
02:41:05,163 --> 02:41:06,303
[SPEAKER_28]: We got a call, yes.

2570
02:41:06,363 --> 02:41:07,504
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, DarkSakura's gonna take this one.

2571
02:41:08,084 --> 02:41:09,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Ghostbusters, what do you want?

2572
02:41:11,085 --> 02:41:12,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's Sterlok.

2573
02:41:12,906 --> 02:41:13,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

2574
02:41:13,986 --> 02:41:14,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

2575
02:41:14,646 --> 02:41:15,206
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?

2576
02:41:15,947 --> 02:41:16,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I am good.

2577
02:41:18,167 --> 02:41:18,928
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?

2578
02:41:19,528 --> 02:41:23,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides being delirious from being up for ten hours straight.

2579
02:41:24,050 --> 02:41:25,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not the delirious one.

2580
02:41:25,330 --> 02:41:26,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob's delirious.

2581
02:41:27,051 --> 02:41:30,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Rob is Mr. Sleep Deprivation Party Pooper.

2582
02:41:31,726 --> 02:41:34,977
[SPEAKER_02]: He hasn't been intaking much alcohol, has he?

2583
02:41:35,298 --> 02:41:38,247
[SPEAKER_18]: He has had two entire drinks.

2584
02:41:39,934 --> 02:41:43,455
[SPEAKER_18]: He hasn't even had the Guinness that I accidentally saved for him.

2585
02:41:45,715 --> 02:41:48,136
[SPEAKER_18]: But I've been making delicious beverages all night.

2586
02:41:48,336 --> 02:41:54,757
[SPEAKER_18]: I made one out of Patron and Grapefruit Juice, which was entirely very tasty.

2587
02:41:55,317 --> 02:41:55,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2588
02:41:55,917 --> 02:41:58,998
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Patron and Orange Juice, and then Brandy and Apple Juice.

2589
02:42:01,119 --> 02:42:01,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And it tastes like pie, doesn't it?

2590
02:42:01,979 --> 02:42:02,719
[SPEAKER_02]: That all sounds very delicious.

2591
02:42:03,659 --> 02:42:04,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Alan had some.

2592
02:42:04,439 --> 02:42:05,119
[SPEAKER_18]: He had lots of it.

2593
02:42:05,219 --> 02:42:05,640
[SPEAKER_18]: That was good.

2594
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:07,320
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like pie.

2595
02:42:07,420 --> 02:42:09,281
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually part of how I make my apple pie drink.

2596
02:42:09,721 --> 02:42:16,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Except when I make the apple pie drink, I let it sit for like a couple of weeks and throw in some cinnamon and spices and it's pretty good.

2597
02:42:16,963 --> 02:42:17,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

2598
02:42:19,723 --> 02:42:20,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2599
02:42:20,724 --> 02:42:22,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have a question for us?

2600
02:42:23,984 --> 02:42:24,705
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care what it is.

2601
02:42:24,725 --> 02:42:25,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Just ask something.

2602
02:42:25,545 --> 02:42:27,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2603
02:42:27,605 --> 02:42:30,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been eagerly awaiting questions.

2604
02:42:31,089 --> 02:42:34,812
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Pokemans in two weeks.

2605
02:42:35,693 --> 02:42:37,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm a big enough nerd.

2606
02:42:38,775 --> 02:42:42,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I am importing and very excited.

2607
02:42:43,079 --> 02:42:44,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh no, your Pokemans let you show me them.

2608
02:42:45,561 --> 02:42:47,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I hear you like Mudkips.

2609
02:42:49,845 --> 02:42:54,829
[SPEAKER_18]: I just thought it was funny at Faname someone cosplayed as a Mudkip.

2610
02:42:56,937 --> 02:42:58,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised.

2611
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, that was also the same year that someone cosplayed as a Wiimote.

2612
02:43:05,147 --> 02:43:05,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is pretty funny.

2613
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:08,851
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii, yeah.

2614
02:43:09,813 --> 02:43:10,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Wee!

2615
02:43:10,333 --> 02:43:10,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Wee!

2616
02:43:10,754 --> 02:43:13,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Did the little pig cry wee wee wee all the way home?

2617
02:43:15,077 --> 02:43:15,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2618
02:43:16,718 --> 02:43:20,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're getting towards the... We've been doing what?

2619
02:43:20,480 --> 02:43:21,321
[SPEAKER_18]: For how long?

2620
02:43:22,101 --> 02:43:24,883
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2621
02:43:24,963 --> 02:43:30,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think this should be an annual event.

2622
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:32,648
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm having fun.

2623
02:43:32,688 --> 02:43:33,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I would pay to...

2624
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:39,841
[SPEAKER_28]: I would pay to see it I've got a PayPal account if you want to contribute

2625
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:59,651
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, no.

2626
02:43:59,911 --> 02:44:02,012
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we'd only be up against DragonCon.

2627
02:44:02,032 --> 02:44:03,112
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, no, I know.

2628
02:44:03,713 --> 02:44:04,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, well.

2629
02:44:05,153 --> 02:44:05,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

2630
02:44:05,893 --> 02:44:06,194
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, well.

2631
02:44:06,254 --> 02:44:06,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, Bobby.

2632
02:44:07,334 --> 02:44:09,455
[SPEAKER_18]: A bunch of my friends are DragonCon right now, anyway.

2633
02:44:10,375 --> 02:44:13,296
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing that.

2634
02:44:13,336 --> 02:44:13,817
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, hi.

2635
02:44:14,557 --> 02:44:18,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a statement for you as well.

2636
02:44:18,438 --> 02:44:18,719
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh-oh.

2637
02:44:20,739 --> 02:44:22,380
Uh-oh.

2638
02:44:26,529 --> 02:44:27,529
[SPEAKER_28]: Look at what you've done.

2639
02:44:28,010 --> 02:44:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what you've done.

2640
02:44:32,731 --> 02:44:33,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this app.

2641
02:44:34,271 --> 02:44:35,971
[SPEAKER_28]: Which one do you have?

2642
02:44:36,091 --> 02:44:36,971
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what's awesome, though?

2643
02:44:36,991 --> 02:44:38,612
[SPEAKER_28]: Because I have a button in front of me, too.

2644
02:44:38,652 --> 02:44:39,572
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what my button does?

2645
02:44:43,013 --> 02:44:44,713
[SPEAKER_28]: No, no, not that button.

2646
02:44:44,733 --> 02:44:46,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you know what my button does to us?

2647
02:44:46,253 --> 02:44:47,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

2648
02:44:47,493 --> 02:44:48,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, Jamie.

2649
02:44:48,474 --> 02:44:48,714
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

2650
02:44:49,154 --> 02:44:50,534
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three.

2651
02:44:54,861 --> 02:44:57,666
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the stupidest marathon in the history of the internet.

2652
02:44:57,806 --> 02:45:00,931
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, wait, Sterlok, you want to know what my button does?

2653
02:45:00,951 --> 02:45:02,073
[SPEAKER_28]: What does your button do?

2654
02:45:02,594 --> 02:45:03,475
[SPEAKER_28]: It hangs up on callers.

2655
02:45:03,535 --> 02:45:09,064
[SPEAKER_17]: You're such a... Rob, you... Alright, dirty, dirty ho bag.

2656
02:45:10,971 --> 02:45:12,513
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2657
02:45:33,012 --> 02:45:34,033
[SPEAKER_28]: Why are we still getting calls?

2658
02:45:34,093 --> 02:45:35,815
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to get to the answer.

2659
02:45:37,156 --> 02:45:38,177
[SPEAKER_28]: Why are people calling?

2660
02:45:38,377 --> 02:45:39,558
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2661
02:45:39,578 --> 02:45:40,159
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, hi.

2662
02:45:40,419 --> 02:45:41,460
[SPEAKER_28]: We're so happy to have you.

2663
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:42,021
[SPEAKER_28]: Who is this?

2664
02:45:43,722 --> 02:45:44,243
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, Rob.

2665
02:45:44,263 --> 02:45:45,003
[SPEAKER_28]: What's up, gang?

2666
02:45:45,524 --> 02:45:45,844
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

2667
02:45:45,924 --> 02:45:46,345
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

2668
02:45:47,906 --> 02:45:48,787
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Scared, though.

2669
02:45:48,807 --> 02:45:49,728
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you doing?

2670
02:45:50,068 --> 02:45:51,009
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, what's up?

2671
02:45:51,189 --> 02:45:51,810
[SPEAKER_28]: How are you doing?

2672
02:45:56,775 --> 02:45:57,115
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello?

2673
02:45:57,135 --> 02:45:57,235
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello?

2674
02:46:01,289 --> 02:46:02,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?

2675
02:46:02,530 --> 02:46:03,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Barely.

2676
02:46:03,170 --> 02:46:03,650
[SPEAKER_28]: What's up?

2677
02:46:03,690 --> 02:46:04,351
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, guys.

2678
02:46:04,591 --> 02:46:05,351
[SPEAKER_28]: What's up, dude?

2679
02:46:05,511 --> 02:46:05,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.

2680
02:46:05,951 --> 02:46:07,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at Walmart, man.

2681
02:46:07,192 --> 02:46:12,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at Walmart just doing some shopping, and I'm listening to you guys for my shitty all-games app radio.

2682
02:46:13,475 --> 02:46:14,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, hold on.

2683
02:46:15,036 --> 02:46:16,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I'd give you guys a call.

2684
02:46:17,057 --> 02:46:22,559
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't criticize the app because it was done, I think, at a very low cost, if not for free.

2685
02:46:23,340 --> 02:46:24,780
[SPEAKER_28]: So we love that app.

2686
02:46:25,441 --> 02:46:28,162
[SPEAKER_28]: If it doesn't work, it's usually the Internet's fault.

2687
02:46:30,527 --> 02:46:33,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening to you guys since about 2pm I'm sorry

2688
02:46:47,557 --> 02:46:48,258
[SPEAKER_28]: I need some preparation, eh?

2689
02:46:48,298 --> 02:46:48,338
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh...

2690
02:47:15,987 --> 02:47:17,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Needs some hemorrhoid pads.

2691
02:47:19,109 --> 02:47:23,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe I need some Propel because I know back in the day Jamie loved Propel.

2692
02:47:24,491 --> 02:47:27,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Propel has been replaced by Vitamin Water Zero.

2693
02:47:27,553 --> 02:47:29,074
[SPEAKER_28]: I love Vitamin Water Zero.

2694
02:47:29,834 --> 02:47:30,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Go get some Barbies.

2695
02:47:37,188 --> 02:47:38,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in the blue jean section right now.

2696
02:47:38,768 --> 02:47:39,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you?

2697
02:47:41,789 --> 02:47:42,229
[SPEAKER_28]: Awesome.

2698
02:47:42,569 --> 02:47:44,189
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, have fun at Walmart.

2699
02:47:44,269 --> 02:47:45,290
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad you're still listening.

2700
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:48,390
[SPEAKER_28]: I love the fact that you're listening on the go on the handy dandy app.

2701
02:47:48,430 --> 02:47:49,170
[SPEAKER_28]: That's hilarious.

2702
02:47:50,351 --> 02:47:51,851
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see how much longer we can go.

2703
02:47:52,111 --> 02:47:52,951
[SPEAKER_28]: Really appreciate it.

2704
02:47:53,431 --> 02:47:56,652
[SPEAKER_28]: And I hope they're not sold out of preparation.

2705
02:47:57,072 --> 02:47:57,512
[SPEAKER_28]: Take care, buddy.

2706
02:47:57,532 --> 02:47:59,433
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to let you go because our connection is kind of wonky.

2707
02:47:59,553 --> 02:48:00,413
[SPEAKER_28]: But you have a good one, okay?

2708
02:48:01,013 --> 02:48:01,933
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, okay.

2709
02:48:01,993 --> 02:48:02,634
[SPEAKER_28]: Later.

2710
02:48:03,914 --> 02:48:06,355
[SPEAKER_28]: He was really, like, cutty and out.

2711
02:48:07,255 --> 02:48:08,936
[SPEAKER_28]: So I had to cut that one short.

2712
02:48:08,956 --> 02:48:09,436
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

2713
02:48:09,596 --> 02:48:10,336
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, caller.

2714
02:48:10,936 --> 02:48:12,137
[SPEAKER_28]: It's nothing personal, I swear.

2715
02:48:12,677 --> 02:48:12,917
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2716
02:48:13,597 --> 02:48:16,458

[SPEAKER_28]: You think everybody would stop listening by now?

2718
02:48:18,279 --> 02:48:21,800
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, usually during the normal show, everybody's tuned out by the time the afterbirth starts.

2719
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:22,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Nobody cares anymore.

[SPEAKER_28]: Somebody went to the LA premiere and we, I don't know, somebody was talking about it.

2736
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:28,125
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess the pads are better and the interface is pretty, but otherwise, hey, it's still DDR.

[SPEAKER_06]: New York City scene is on its way out.

2742
02:50:32,168 --> 02:50:34,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of almost dead at this point.

2743
02:50:34,772 --> 02:50:36,195

[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:50:55,073 --> 02:50:56,294
[SPEAKER_28]: What's a little, come on.

2754
02:50:56,334 --> 02:50:58,856
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta give the listeners some crap once in a while.

2755
02:50:59,337 --> 02:50:59,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2756
02:51:02,179 --> 02:51:03,901
[SPEAKER_28]: But okay, so the New York scene is dying.

2757
02:51:03,941 --> 02:51:04,561
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry to hear that.

2758
02:51:04,581 --> 02:51:07,724
[SPEAKER_28]: But hey, at least you're getting laid so all's good with the world, right?

2759
02:51:09,145 --> 02:51:10,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much, I mean, you know.

2760
02:51:10,506 --> 02:51:12,528
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, DDR is like

2761
02:51:13,314 --> 02:51:16,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as big as it used to be here, but whatever.

2762
02:51:16,575 --> 02:51:17,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We still play somewhat.

2763
02:51:17,776 --> 02:51:21,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to avoid CF like the plague at home in New York.

2764
02:51:22,378 --> 02:51:28,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Coney Island scene is pretty much a wasteland at this point.

2765
02:51:28,801 --> 02:51:34,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it, but everyone's going out to either deep parts of Queens or New Jersey to play.

2766
02:51:34,223 --> 02:51:36,624
[SPEAKER_28]: Wasn't Coney Island supposed to be getting this huge makeover?

2767
02:51:36,924 --> 02:51:39,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Like now or something?

2768
02:51:39,245 --> 02:51:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Even then, Luna Park doesn't have arcades.

2769
02:51:42,610 --> 02:52:10,230
[SPEAKER_06]: that's a problem all the other arcades they used to be an arcade they used to have DDR but it burned down this past year so I don't know whether they'll have DDR when they rebuild all the other places are pretty much the same I mean it's like I can't think of any good places to play now even the one that we had in Queens basically the mall kicked them out so they got sent further into Long Island

2770
02:52:11,930 --> 02:52:13,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's bullshit now.

2771
02:52:13,791 --> 02:52:23,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually go out to, like, Bayside, you know, to Peter Pan Games to play, you know, 2DX, and now we have Poppin' 17.

2772
02:52:24,034 --> 02:52:27,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we got the latest version of Poppin' in New York.

2773
02:52:30,136 --> 02:52:32,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but that just came up recently.

2774
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:35,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I'm just trying to keep this show going with this.

2775
02:52:35,812 --> 02:52:37,053
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's all good.

2776
02:52:37,614 --> 02:52:39,015
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate your dedication.

2777
02:52:39,035 --> 02:52:41,577
[SPEAKER_28]: But we're going to let you go real quick because we have a special announcement to make, okay?

2778
02:52:43,081 --> 02:52:45,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, make sure to go to 2pm.

2779
02:52:46,804 --> 02:52:47,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, right.

2780
02:52:47,284 --> 02:52:48,305
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2781
02:52:48,445 --> 02:52:48,725
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

2782
02:52:50,286 --> 02:52:52,328
[SPEAKER_28]: Ladies and gentlemen, we have made it to midnight.

2783
02:52:52,408 --> 02:52:54,710
[SPEAKER_28]: It is now midnight.

2784
02:52:54,850 --> 02:53:03,937
[SPEAKER_28]: The goal was to make it for 10 hours and we have successfully been broadcasting at Lovely All Games Radio for 10 hours and this is the point where we would call it off, but...

2785
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:05,751
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's keep going.

2786
02:53:05,791 --> 02:53:06,271
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's keep going.

2787
02:53:06,492 --> 02:53:07,372
[SPEAKER_28]: We got another hour.

2788
02:53:07,432 --> 02:53:08,093
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's keep going.

2789
02:53:08,113 --> 02:53:09,034
[SPEAKER_28]: We got another hour in this.

2790
02:53:09,074 --> 02:53:09,655
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's keep going.

2791
02:53:09,675 --> 02:53:10,515
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's do it.

2792
02:53:11,156 --> 02:53:11,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it.

2793
02:53:11,476 --> 02:53:11,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do it.

2794
02:53:12,177 --> 02:53:14,099
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.

2795
02:53:14,239 --> 02:53:14,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

2796
02:53:14,819 --> 02:53:15,059
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2797
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:18,262
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, did you see the screen was lit up with calls?

2798
02:53:18,282 --> 02:53:18,843
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you see that?

2799
02:53:19,063 --> 02:53:19,343
[SPEAKER_28]: I did.

2800
02:53:19,824 --> 02:53:20,404
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my gosh.

2801
02:53:20,444 --> 02:53:20,665
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2802
02:53:20,685 --> 02:53:21,766
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll try to get a couple more calls.

2803
02:53:22,006 --> 02:53:24,688
[SPEAKER_28]: How about listless results real fast though before I go back to the phones?

2804
02:53:24,728 --> 02:53:25,489
[SPEAKER_20]: Listless results.

2805
02:53:25,629 --> 02:53:26,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Listless results.

2806
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:26,990
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hurrying.

2807
02:53:28,979 --> 02:53:32,885
[SPEAKER_28]: The definitive list of the things you most want to see in the OLR marathon 2011.

2808
02:53:32,985 --> 02:53:34,567
[SPEAKER_28]: Oops, I never counted.

2809
02:53:36,329 --> 02:53:38,052
[SPEAKER_14]: You are such a dork.

2810
02:53:38,072 --> 02:53:39,494
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two leaders, clearly.

2811
02:53:43,339 --> 02:53:44,200
[SPEAKER_28]: 21 votes for that one.

2812
02:54:07,071 --> 02:54:07,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2813
02:54:07,792 --> 02:54:09,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Well then just read them, shit.

2814
02:54:09,173 --> 02:54:09,653
[SPEAKER_28]: Fine, here it is.

2815
02:54:10,074 --> 02:54:15,759
[SPEAKER_28]: Tied for number three, the most definitive things you want to see on the OLR Marathon 2011.

2816
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:17,820
[SPEAKER_28]: A laser light show!

2817
02:54:18,521 --> 02:54:19,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

2818
02:54:19,522 --> 02:54:22,284
[SPEAKER_28]: I love how the radio listeners voted for a laser light show.

2819
02:54:23,625 --> 02:54:27,669
[SPEAKER_28]: Gabe and Tycho show up and say, this is where the real party's at, bitches!

2820
02:54:28,229 --> 02:54:29,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

2821
02:54:29,771 --> 02:54:33,434
[SPEAKER_28]: Although they won't have to now, because PAX got moved a week back, so they really could do that.

2822
02:54:34,154 --> 02:54:34,234
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh...

2823
02:54:34,975 --> 02:54:36,736
[SPEAKER_28]: The number two definitive answer.

2824
02:54:36,796 --> 02:54:37,777
[SPEAKER_28]: This is it.

2825
02:54:38,097 --> 02:54:41,259
[SPEAKER_28]: Once we're past this, guys, this is the definitive list.

2826
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:42,220
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no arguing.

2827
02:54:43,160 --> 02:54:43,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Just read it already.

2828
02:54:44,101 --> 02:54:44,541
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, fine.

2829
02:54:44,981 --> 02:54:47,443
[SPEAKER_28]: Livestream of GoGoDancing in 8-bit cosplay.

2830
02:54:47,563 --> 02:54:48,784
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

2831
02:54:49,918 --> 02:54:52,640
[SPEAKER_28]: And the number one answer is a tie.

2832
02:54:53,141 --> 02:54:54,943
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a tie.

2833
02:54:55,383 --> 02:54:55,743
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2834
02:54:55,863 --> 02:54:56,504
[SPEAKER_28]: Read it.

2835
02:54:57,205 --> 02:54:59,386
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually playing games on video.

2836
02:54:59,547 --> 02:55:01,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

2837
02:55:01,889 --> 02:55:03,290
[SPEAKER_28]: And these are landslide.

2838
02:55:03,910 --> 02:55:07,213
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki sings hours and hours of disco.

2839
02:55:08,254 --> 02:55:09,375
[SPEAKER_28]: At the car wash.

2840
02:55:12,638 --> 02:55:13,058
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2841
02:55:13,098 --> 02:55:15,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought a bunch of PSP and DS games that are still in the car.

2842
02:55:16,121 --> 02:55:16,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you?

2843
02:55:16,361 --> 02:55:17,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I didn't know what we were going to do today.

2844
02:55:18,282 --> 02:55:18,803
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't either.

2845
02:55:20,384 --> 02:55:21,004
[SPEAKER_28]: I just showed up.

2846
02:55:21,024 --> 02:55:21,765
[SPEAKER_14]: They're still in the car.

2847
02:55:23,046 --> 02:55:24,326
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2848
02:55:24,367 --> 02:55:24,767
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

2849
02:55:26,048 --> 02:55:26,568
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, hello?

2850
02:55:26,888 --> 02:55:27,249
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

2851
02:55:28,269 --> 02:55:29,971
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2852
02:55:30,111 --> 02:55:31,772
[SPEAKER_28]: DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?

2853
02:55:31,792 --> 02:55:32,492
[SPEAKER_28]: $50 bill.

2854
02:55:35,305 --> 02:55:35,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much.

2855
02:55:36,206 --> 02:55:39,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 3am and I'm half a loopy, so... Oh!

2856
02:55:39,829 --> 02:55:40,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Join the club.

2857
02:55:40,549 --> 02:55:41,990
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll be a perfect fit for our show.

2858
02:55:42,030 --> 02:55:42,791
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2859
02:55:44,032 --> 02:55:44,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2860
02:55:44,793 --> 02:55:45,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the call earlier.

2861
02:55:45,914 --> 02:55:51,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sakura said about going older and not playing games as much and DDR just fading out.

2862
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:54,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I agree with that.

2863
02:55:54,981 --> 02:56:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's next to no place to play DR anymore and even I stopped playing and I didn't get bored of it.

2864
02:56:01,586 --> 02:56:03,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got tired of all these new kids coming around and causing...

2865
02:56:04,690 --> 02:56:05,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

2866
02:56:25,251 --> 02:56:31,595
[SPEAKER_28]: There's Dance Central for those folks that really want something in the mainstream and like their music to be in the mainstream and top 40.

2867
02:56:32,256 --> 02:56:37,039
[SPEAKER_28]: And then for folks that have really grown up on the Bomani hits from Japan, there's Dance Masters.

2868
02:56:37,379 --> 02:56:41,422
[SPEAKER_28]: I really think there's something for everyone on Kinect, and it's kind of exciting where that's going.

2869
02:56:41,442 --> 02:56:43,883
[SPEAKER_28]: And it almost makes me excited about music games again.

2870
02:56:44,223 --> 02:56:45,444
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that game DDR?

2871
02:56:46,225 --> 02:56:48,326
[SPEAKER_28]: No, but DDR's been around since 1998.

2872
02:56:48,366 --> 02:56:48,466
[SPEAKER_28]: It's...

2873
02:56:51,548 --> 02:56:53,268
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been an epically long series.

2874
02:56:53,549 --> 02:56:55,829
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay for it to be dying out right about now, you know?

2875
02:56:57,029 --> 02:56:58,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not disagreeing with that.

2876
02:56:58,750 --> 02:57:01,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind it dying out because it's been around forever.

2877
02:57:01,651 --> 02:57:14,534
[SPEAKER_01]: But my only thing with the two dance games that I was thinking about when I actually saw it was, both of them, I would actually like to see something where you can make your own choreography, not just follow what they have on screen.

2878
02:57:15,634 --> 02:57:18,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything seems to be set to, so you pick one song,

2879
02:57:18,956 --> 02:57:21,716
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow that choreography for that song and it never changes.

2880
02:57:22,997 --> 02:57:28,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to see, because they have, it's the way it looks like is that they're broken to sections.

2881
02:57:28,818 --> 02:57:33,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a four beat for one step, maybe two beats for another step.

2882
02:57:33,339 --> 02:57:38,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you kind of like put it together the way it looks in the commercials.

2883
02:57:38,719 --> 02:57:46,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I'm thinking is, if there's some way maybe to shuffle something around so you can kind of make your own choreography to the song, your own version to it.

2884
02:57:47,041 --> 02:57:47,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Mm-hmm.

2885
02:57:48,254 --> 02:58:00,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one way I was thinking it would actually make the game look better, because otherwise, I mean, I could see it being good, but at the same time, I don't know, it just seems kind of too limited.

2886
02:58:00,361 --> 02:58:04,063
[SPEAKER_28]: I honestly, honestly think that Dance Masters is the future of DDR.

2887
02:58:04,223 --> 02:58:07,485
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I think that's where Konami's putting their stock, is this whole Kinect thing.

2888
02:58:07,625 --> 02:58:10,327
[SPEAKER_28]: And if it takes off, you're going to see something like it in arcades, too.

2889
02:58:11,648 --> 02:58:12,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I hope so.

2890
02:58:12,648 --> 02:58:14,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they fix the lag in the Kinect...

2891
02:58:15,768 --> 02:58:18,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this will definitely take off like crazy.

2892
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can even see dance schools utilizing this.

2893
02:58:21,172 --> 02:58:21,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

2894
02:58:21,993 --> 02:58:22,213
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2895
02:58:22,493 --> 02:58:23,974
[SPEAKER_28]: Buddy, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.

2896
02:58:24,154 --> 02:58:25,315
[SPEAKER_28]: But thanks so much for the call, okay?

2897
02:58:25,976 --> 02:58:26,676
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll get some coffee.

2898
02:58:26,716 --> 02:58:27,056
[SPEAKER_28]: See you later.

2899
02:58:27,076 --> 02:58:27,297
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2900
02:58:27,337 --> 02:58:27,797
[SPEAKER_28]: Good luck.

2901
02:58:29,698 --> 02:58:29,918
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2902
02:58:29,938 --> 02:58:31,660
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll try and get some more calls in.

2903
02:58:31,680 --> 02:58:34,082
[SPEAKER_28]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2904
02:58:34,102 --> 02:58:36,003
[SPEAKER_28]: We still have one more game we want to play before the night's over.

2905
02:58:36,643 --> 02:58:40,927
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'll probably do that in the last segment here after another break.

2906
02:58:42,007 --> 02:58:45,050
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm trying to at least get a couple more calls in if there's still people interested in calling.

2907
02:58:45,070 --> 02:58:48,533
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll give it a couple more minutes.

2908
02:58:48,933 --> 02:58:50,555
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on the OLR-a-thon.

2909
02:58:50,615 --> 02:58:50,955
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

2910
02:58:51,816 --> 02:58:52,376
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Misty.

2911
02:58:52,576 --> 02:58:53,197
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Misty.

2912
02:58:53,237 --> 02:58:53,777
[SPEAKER_28]: How are you?

2913
02:58:54,478 --> 02:58:55,058
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm doing good.

2914
02:58:55,859 --> 02:58:56,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Awesome.

2915
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:57,520
[SPEAKER_25]: The Walmart thing, though?

2916
02:58:58,141 --> 02:58:58,661
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah?

2917
02:58:59,762 --> 02:59:04,266
[SPEAKER_25]: In the middle of the night, it's called I Closed and I Need Some DVDs to Burn Shit To.

2918
02:59:05,487 --> 02:59:05,847
[SPEAKER_28]: I see.

2919
02:59:06,148 --> 02:59:07,929
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you actually close to Walmart where you are?

2920
02:59:07,949 --> 02:59:08,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Whoa.

2921
02:59:09,692 --> 02:59:12,038
[SPEAKER_25]: I got a ride home that night, but still.

2922
02:59:12,319 --> 02:59:12,620
[SPEAKER_28]: I see.

2923
02:59:13,723 --> 02:59:14,305
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well.

2924
02:59:15,192 --> 02:59:18,034
[SPEAKER_28]: Sometimes you need to make the emergency Walmart run, I suppose.

2925
02:59:18,114 --> 02:59:18,955
[SPEAKER_28]: Although, I don't know.

2926
02:59:19,115 --> 02:59:21,637
[SPEAKER_28]: I wish they had 24-hour targets.

2927
02:59:21,697 --> 02:59:25,520
[SPEAKER_28]: And yes, I realize I'm supposed to be boycotting Target, apparently.

2928
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:26,641
[SPEAKER_28]: But I can't.

2929
02:59:27,681 --> 02:59:28,922
[SPEAKER_25]: They're less evil than Walmart.

2930
02:59:29,163 --> 02:59:31,064
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, it's the lesser of two evils.

2931
02:59:31,144 --> 02:59:31,484
[SPEAKER_28]: Still.

2932
02:59:32,085 --> 02:59:35,087
[SPEAKER_28]: They could donate another $150,000 to whatever organization.

2933
02:59:35,147 --> 02:59:37,088
[SPEAKER_28]: It still is less evil than Walmart in my book.

2934
02:59:37,108 --> 02:59:39,030
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm a hippie like that.

2935
02:59:39,090 --> 02:59:39,390
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

2936
02:59:39,410 --> 02:59:40,371
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

2937
02:59:41,451 --> 02:59:44,393
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what about games and stuff?

2938
02:59:44,453 --> 02:59:46,234
[SPEAKER_28]: Any game-y related things you want to share?

2939
02:59:46,274 --> 02:59:47,154
[SPEAKER_28]: Things you've been playing lately?

2940
02:59:48,455 --> 02:59:51,817
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been working on some Green Day Rock Band on during the show, admittedly.

2941
02:59:51,997 --> 02:59:52,498
[SPEAKER_25]: How is that?

2942
02:59:53,899 --> 02:59:54,339
[SPEAKER_25]: I like it.

2943
02:59:54,559 --> 02:59:58,741
[SPEAKER_25]: It turns out that I like more Green Day stuff than I thought I originally would.

2944
02:59:58,761 --> 03:00:01,103
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I never got to play it back in the day.

2945
03:00:01,724 --> 03:00:09,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you ever done that when you get one of those type of band packs or band games or whatever, you're kind of like, oh, I didn't realize they sang that song.

2946
03:00:09,866 --> 03:00:16,788
[SPEAKER_28]: Because I've kind of had that happen, like buying Greatest Hits CDs, you know, you're listening to it and you're like, oh, this band did that song too?

2947
03:00:16,888 --> 03:00:18,068
[SPEAKER_28]: And I never realized that.

2948
03:00:18,868 --> 03:00:19,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you kind of have that going on?

2949
03:00:20,309 --> 03:00:26,690
[SPEAKER_25]: For rock band DLC, it's been more, I got, I sheaped into buying some DLC and it's like, oh, this ain't bad.

2950
03:00:26,710 --> 03:00:27,251
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice.

2951
03:00:28,391 --> 03:00:28,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice.

2952
03:00:30,362 --> 03:00:37,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, Misty, we'll let you get back to some Green Day Rock Band so we can take some more calls, but enjoy your future trips to Walmart and enjoy Green Day Rock Band, okay?

2953
03:00:38,590 --> 03:00:39,191
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, thanks.

2954
03:00:39,251 --> 03:00:39,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, later.

2955
03:00:39,732 --> 03:00:43,415
[SPEAKER_28]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2956
03:00:43,796 --> 03:00:44,476
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on the show.

2957
03:00:44,516 --> 03:00:44,857
[SPEAKER_28]: Who's this?

2958
03:00:45,778 --> 03:00:46,899
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, it's Tiara.

2959
03:00:46,999 --> 03:00:47,820
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Tiara.

2960
03:00:47,860 --> 03:00:48,600
[SPEAKER_23]: What's on your mind?

2961
03:00:48,620 --> 03:00:48,661
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

2962
03:00:50,329 --> 03:00:53,051
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to call in and say that you are complaining.

2963
03:00:53,091 --> 03:00:55,853
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you're not really complaining about how long you've been doing the show.

2964
03:00:55,873 --> 03:00:56,733
[SPEAKER_23]: You're kind of bragging.

2965
03:00:56,794 --> 03:01:00,596
[SPEAKER_23]: But I've been doing this since 11 o'clock this morning, and so has DarkSakura.

2966
03:01:00,616 --> 03:01:03,638
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think both of us kind of beat out the rest of you.

2967
03:01:04,058 --> 03:01:04,819
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, you women.

2968
03:01:05,379 --> 03:01:07,561
[SPEAKER_28]: You always have to assert your dominance over the rest of us.

2969
03:01:07,601 --> 03:01:08,061
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

2970
03:01:08,361 --> 03:01:10,543
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I think DarkSakura is crazy.

2971
03:01:10,603 --> 03:01:16,787
[SPEAKER_28]: Like when she told me that she was doing a podcast, she's like, oh, yeah, 2 o'clock is fine because I've got to get up to do another podcast at 11.

2972
03:01:16,827 --> 03:01:18,748
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm like, and then you're going to do a 10-hour show?

2973
03:01:18,948 --> 03:01:19,689
[SPEAKER_28]: You're crazy.

2974
03:01:21,069 --> 03:01:25,010
[SPEAKER_23]: She just told me that she wanted to do a 12-hour show and be up until 2.

2975
03:01:25,270 --> 03:01:27,831
[SPEAKER_23]: I was like, well, you've already done 12 hours.

2976
03:01:27,911 --> 03:01:28,451
[SPEAKER_23]: It's okay.

2977
03:01:28,471 --> 03:01:29,271
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't have to do that.

2978
03:01:29,291 --> 03:01:29,611
[SPEAKER_28]: It's true.

2979
03:01:29,651 --> 03:01:31,632
[SPEAKER_28]: You're on hour 13 if you think about it.

2980
03:01:31,652 --> 03:01:32,632
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I know.

2981
03:01:32,692 --> 03:01:35,153
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like, come on, guys.

2982
03:01:35,193 --> 03:01:35,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's wrap it up.

2983
03:01:36,033 --> 03:01:37,473
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to go to sleep, all right?

2984
03:01:37,933 --> 03:01:38,513
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm trying.

2985
03:01:38,753 --> 03:01:40,954
[SPEAKER_28]: The phones will not stop ringing.

2986
03:01:41,354 --> 03:01:43,275
[SPEAKER_18]: We're still at, what, over 100 listeners right now?

2987
03:01:43,716 --> 03:01:44,256
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, not quite.

2988
03:01:44,276 --> 03:01:44,696
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

2989
03:01:44,796 --> 03:01:46,577
[SPEAKER_28]: But, I mean, for internet radio, we're sitting pretty.

2990
03:01:46,617 --> 03:01:47,498
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are really popular tonight.

2991
03:01:47,778 --> 03:01:48,459
[SPEAKER_28]: It's crazy.

2992
03:01:48,699 --> 03:01:52,921
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, a lot of old listeners, for some reason, have decided to come back tonight to hear the marathon.

2993
03:01:52,941 --> 03:01:53,622
[SPEAKER_28]: So, it's great.

2994
03:01:54,022 --> 03:01:56,204
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, any stunt to get ratings?

2995
03:01:56,284 --> 03:01:57,104
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey!

2996
03:01:57,304 --> 03:02:03,268
[SPEAKER_23]: And you know, my companion, Rob Kidman, the doctor-ish guy, he's listening now.

2997
03:02:03,348 --> 03:02:08,091
[SPEAKER_23]: He's actually, he went to sleep before the show started, or maybe right after the show started.

2998
03:02:08,531 --> 03:02:10,373
[SPEAKER_23]: And now he's awake again, and he said he's listening.

2999
03:02:10,433 --> 03:02:10,913
[SPEAKER_23]: So, hi, Rob!

3000
03:02:10,933 --> 03:02:11,293
[SPEAKER_23]: Rob!

[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, Chop!

[SPEAKER_28]: He should call.

3005
03:02:14,478 --> 03:02:19,644
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, if he doesn't have Skype, he can't, because overseas it's really hard to call the 800 number.

3006
03:02:19,664 --> 03:02:20,465
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not really toll-free.

3007
03:02:20,486 --> 03:02:24,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'm not sure if he has Skype or not, so if he does, then he should call.

3008
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:25,072
[SPEAKER_28]: He should get on that.

3009
03:02:27,151 --> 03:02:48,742

3063
03:06:09,344 --> 03:06:09,724
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

3064
03:06:09,744 --> 03:06:12,145
[SPEAKER_07]: They took away the lane battles.

3065
03:06:13,065 --> 03:06:14,806
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you have to do it through Battle.net now.

3066
03:06:15,006 --> 03:06:15,586
[SPEAKER_28]: It's crazy.

3067
03:06:15,826 --> 03:06:16,346
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know why.

3068
03:06:16,486 --> 03:06:23,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is horrible because we've got like 10 people playing and it's constantly lagging on a shared connection.

3069
03:06:25,749 --> 03:06:29,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got it wired connected through a switch.

3070
03:06:30,431 --> 03:06:30,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

3071
03:06:31,832 --> 03:06:34,373
[SPEAKER_28]: But of course, there's so many of you on it, it's lagging, of course.

3072
03:06:34,973 --> 03:06:36,113
[SPEAKER_28]: Look at all those nerds.

3073
03:06:36,633 --> 03:06:40,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that you posing at the end of the laptop table?

3074
03:06:40,934 --> 03:06:41,494
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's not him.

3075
03:06:42,234 --> 03:06:43,515
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm the one taking the picture.

3076
03:06:43,555 --> 03:06:43,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

3077
03:06:44,115 --> 03:06:44,375
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

3078
03:06:45,595 --> 03:06:46,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Your friend's doing epic posing.

3079
03:06:47,596 --> 03:06:51,797
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to let you go, SJ100Matt, so we can take one more break and hopefully wrap things up in the next segment.

3080
03:06:51,817 --> 03:06:52,197
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, buddy?

3081

[SPEAKER_28]: All right, have fun.

3084
03:06:56,138 --> 03:06:57,818
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell everyone we said, suck.

3085
03:06:58,973 --> 03:06:59,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

3150
03:10:14,684 --> 03:10:24,494
[SPEAKER_23]: And any games and TV shows about Las Vegas, they're usually about my life, but I have to kind of moderate them and tell them not to tell all of my secrets at once.

3151
03:10:24,834 --> 03:10:25,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Mm-hmm.

3152

[SPEAKER_28]: And what do you do?

3153
03:10:27,596 --> 03:10:29,458
[SPEAKER_28]: So since you live in Vegas, what do you do for a living?

[SPEAKER_28]: And what's the other?

3206
03:13:51,528 --> 03:13:56,652

03:14:02,108 --> 03:14:03,189
[SPEAKER_28]: Tiara is very quick at this.

3211
03:14:04,250 --> 03:14:04,830
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I got one.

[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, you have one yet?

3215
03:14:12,237 --> 03:14:12,837
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it's Ding.

03:14:12,997 --> 03:14:13,217
[SPEAKER_27]: Ding.

3217
03:14:13,478 --> 03:14:13,758
[SPEAKER_27]: Bradley?

3218
03:14:15,940 --> 03:14:16,240
[SPEAKER_28]: Almost.

3219
03:14:17,721 --> 03:14:19,923
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, just listen to the music again while he thinks about his answer.

3220
03:14:21,164 --> 03:14:22,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally dig the 70s here.

[SPEAKER_28]: So here we go.

3226
03:14:26,852 --> 03:14:27,252
[SPEAKER_28]: Kill the music.

[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

3228
03:14:29,193 --> 03:14:31,574
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan was very upset to be missing tomorrow's Raid for the Guild Warcraft.

3229
03:14:31,614 --> 03:14:33,075
[SPEAKER_28]: Getting crafty, he came up with an idea to make a raid.

3230
03:14:33,315 --> 03:14:37,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob, he said, if you let me go to the raid tomorrow, I will... Tiara?

3233
03:15:11,793 --> 03:15:14,513
[SPEAKER_16]: I was listening to Patton Oswalt the other day.

3234
03:15:14,713 --> 03:15:15,734
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know what that means.

3235
03:15:18,134 --> 03:15:19,434
[SPEAKER_23]: You're a liar, sir.

3236
03:15:20,875 --> 03:15:21,675
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't lie.

3237
03:15:23,295 --> 03:15:25,696
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, I will... Scream like a little girl.

3238
03:15:25,996 --> 03:15:27,416
[SPEAKER_28]: Scream like a little girl.

3239
03:15:28,596 --> 03:15:30,837
[SPEAKER_28]: If I let him go to the raid, he'll scream like a girl.

3240
03:15:30,877 --> 03:15:33,037
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if that's incentive, but okay.

3241
03:15:35,117 --> 03:15:36,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking of a different answer.

3242
03:15:36,878 --> 03:15:37,578
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, that's all right.

3243
03:15:39,526 --> 03:15:40,627
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, not a match.

3244
03:15:41,647 --> 03:15:42,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Dare I ask it?

3245
03:15:43,068 --> 03:15:47,030
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, if you let me go to the raid tomorrow, I will... Pay for your Pinkberry.

3246
03:15:47,210 --> 03:15:48,691
[SPEAKER_28]: Pay for your Pinkberry!

3247
03:15:50,451 --> 03:15:51,072
[SPEAKER_28]: Not a match.

03:15:51,132 --> 03:15:57,415
[SPEAKER_28]: And my answer was, quote, if you let me go to the raid tomorrow, I will... Buy you Pinkberry!

03:16:01,403 --> 03:16:02,344
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you serious?

3250
03:16:02,384 --> 03:16:03,245
[SPEAKER_28]: Look, I wrote it down.

3251
03:16:03,265 --> 03:16:05,107
[SPEAKER_28]: They're meant to be.

3252
03:16:05,267 --> 03:16:10,874
[SPEAKER_27]: They're so cute.

3253
03:16:11,675 --> 03:16:13,376
[SPEAKER_17]: There was boy smooching in this house.

3254
03:16:13,437 --> 03:16:14,458
[SPEAKER_17]: It was great.

3255
03:16:15,659 --> 03:16:16,920
[SPEAKER_28]: Sadly, not a match.

[SPEAKER_28]: There it is.

3257
03:16:18,662 --> 03:16:22,505
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, but hey, you still have a chance to make it all up on question number two.

3258
03:16:23,526 --> 03:16:24,326
[SPEAKER_28]: It's still tied.

3259
03:16:24,726 --> 03:16:26,688
[SPEAKER_28]: The board is tied zero to zero.

3260
03:16:27,468 --> 03:16:27,969
[SPEAKER_28]: So here we go.

3261
03:16:28,469 --> 03:16:30,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, AZHP, you didn't get a match either.

3262
03:16:30,971 --> 03:16:31,471
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, here it is.

[SPEAKER_28]: You ready?

3265
03:16:33,833 --> 03:16:39,257
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie is getting very excited for her upcoming Disneyland trip to see Tron.

3266
03:16:41,252 --> 03:16:45,333
[SPEAKER_28]: I am so excited to go see Electronica, exclaimed Jamie.

3267
03:16:46,133 --> 03:16:48,153
[SPEAKER_28]: I have everything for my trip packed.

[SPEAKER_28]: My money, my Disney pins, and my blank.

3269
03:16:59,256 --> 03:17:05,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie said, I am so excited to go see Electronica, and I have everything for my trip packed.

3270
03:17:05,977 --> 03:17:09,518
[SPEAKER_28]: My money, my Disney pins, and my blank.

3271
03:17:17,007 --> 03:17:18,270
[SPEAKER_27]: We dinged at the same time.

3272
03:17:18,290 --> 03:17:20,054
[SPEAKER_27]: Too bad you don't get a point for that.

[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know how you pack the hoes.

3276
03:17:53,863 --> 03:17:54,803
[SPEAKER_28]: Like panty hoes?

3277
03:17:54,904 --> 03:17:56,564
[SPEAKER_28]: Or like my pimps and hoes?

3278
03:17:57,145 --> 03:17:57,805
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, your whores.

3279
03:17:58,606 --> 03:17:59,106
[SPEAKER_28]: Her hoes.

3280
03:17:59,206 --> 03:18:00,527
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I don't know how you pack them.

3281
03:18:01,087 --> 03:18:03,328
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to use a lot of that like styrofoam?

3282
03:18:03,969 --> 03:18:04,809
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well you never know.

3283
03:18:04,829 --> 03:18:06,670
[SPEAKER_28]: There has to be holes in the box.

3284
03:18:06,770 --> 03:18:08,291
[SPEAKER_17]: I use Charmin, Rob.

3285
03:18:08,351 --> 03:18:08,992
[SPEAKER_17]: I use Charmin.

3286
03:18:09,312 --> 03:18:16,176
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, AZHP said my money, my Disney pins, and my Pinkberry!

3287
03:18:16,196 --> 03:18:16,376
[SPEAKER_28]: Pinkberry!

3288
03:18:16,716 --> 03:18:17,477
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3289
03:18:42,168 --> 03:18:43,608
[SPEAKER_28]: I have everything for my trip packed.

3290
03:18:43,668 --> 03:18:46,129
[SPEAKER_28]: My money, my Disney pins, and my... Light cycle.

3291
03:18:46,649 --> 03:18:47,629
[SPEAKER_28]: Light cycle!

3292
03:18:47,649 --> 03:18:49,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, I'm stealing Bradley's answer because I agree with it.

3293
03:18:51,470 --> 03:18:51,950
[SPEAKER_28]: It doesn't matter.

3294
03:18:51,990 --> 03:18:52,730
[SPEAKER_28]: It's still not a match.

3295
03:18:53,991 --> 03:18:58,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, I have my money, my Disney pins, and my... Shermie.

3296
03:18:58,912 --> 03:18:59,812
[SPEAKER_28]: Shermie!

3297
03:19:00,572 --> 03:19:00,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Aww.

3298
03:19:01,232 --> 03:19:02,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Shermie would be afraid.

3299
03:19:02,633 --> 03:19:04,033
[SPEAKER_28]: That might be a match on Ho.

3300
03:19:04,353 --> 03:19:04,373
I...

3301
03:19:04,953 --> 03:19:07,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeremy is a stinky little hoebag sometimes.

3302
03:19:07,754 --> 03:19:08,315
[SPEAKER_18]: She is.

3303
03:19:08,675 --> 03:19:09,275
[SPEAKER_18]: She is.

3304
03:19:09,315 --> 03:19:10,456
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a whore for petting.

3305
03:19:10,996 --> 03:19:12,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say that's a half point.

3306
03:19:12,597 --> 03:19:14,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I don't know.

3307
03:19:14,498 --> 03:19:15,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeremy's a whore.

3308
03:19:17,559 --> 03:19:18,019
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

3309
03:19:19,060 --> 03:19:19,860
[SPEAKER_28]: No, sorry.

3310
03:19:19,980 --> 03:19:21,461
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, Tiara.

3311
03:19:21,521 --> 03:19:25,343
[SPEAKER_28]: The judges backstage have issued an order that you are not to get a half point for that.

3312
03:19:25,403 --> 03:19:26,083
[SPEAKER_28]: Go judges.

3313
03:19:26,263 --> 03:19:26,563
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

3314
03:19:28,124 --> 03:19:33,307
[SPEAKER_28]: and my answer is my money, my Disney pins and my sure me.

3315
03:19:33,347 --> 03:19:33,748
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

3316
03:19:33,788 --> 03:19:34,528
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't say the same answer.

3317
03:19:34,568 --> 03:19:37,190
[SPEAKER_28]: My money, my Disney pins and my glow sticks.

3318
03:19:38,711 --> 03:19:39,772
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, come on.

3319
03:19:39,792 --> 03:19:41,693
[SPEAKER_23]: That was hot.

3320
03:19:44,094 --> 03:19:44,855
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

3321
03:19:45,115 --> 03:19:47,397
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all going to be a party without any hoes.

3322
03:19:47,417 --> 03:19:48,217
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I'm saying.

3323
03:19:48,357 --> 03:19:49,718
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, because they'll be in L.A.

3324
03:19:49,758 --> 03:19:50,819
[SPEAKER_28]: There's plenty there already.

3325
03:19:50,939 --> 03:19:51,919
[SPEAKER_23]: I need my bitches.

3326

[SPEAKER_28]: Final question of the night.

03:20:00,594 --> 03:20:03,675
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob is getting very nostalgic for DDR.

3331
03:20:04,856 --> 03:20:08,297
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, we played a lot of DDR songs tonight, and I'm getting nostalgic for DDR.

3332
03:20:09,218 --> 03:20:13,039
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think it might be time to finally get a DDR machine for his apartment.

3333

[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

3348
03:21:15,559 --> 03:21:17,260
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of you people in chat are sick.

03:21:18,100 --> 03:21:19,601
[SPEAKER_28]: You are sick people.

03:21:29,307 --> 03:21:31,908
[SPEAKER_28]: I know how I'll make the money, Rob thought to himself.

[SPEAKER_28]: I'll sell all my...

3357
03:21:34,258 --> 03:21:36,459
[SPEAKER_28]: Old Console DDR Games.

3358
03:21:37,019 --> 03:21:39,080
[SPEAKER_28]: Old Console DDR Games.

3359
03:21:39,160 --> 03:21:40,901
[SPEAKER_28]: A very practical answer.

3360
03:21:41,641 --> 03:21:42,462
[SPEAKER_28]: You're going to lose.

3361
03:21:42,542 --> 03:21:46,043
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry to say, but practical answers never work.

3362
03:21:46,063 --> 03:21:46,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, no, I'm kidding.

3363
03:21:46,884 --> 03:21:47,384
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll never know.

3364
03:21:48,365 --> 03:21:52,987
[SPEAKER_28]: AZHP says, I'll sell all my porn collection.

3365
03:21:53,767 --> 03:21:54,988
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's see.

3366
03:21:56,345 --> 03:21:59,246
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, I know how I'll make the money, Rob thought to himself.

3367
03:21:59,406 --> 03:22:01,467
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll sell all my... Surprise butt sex.

3368
03:22:01,627 --> 03:22:03,228
[SPEAKER_28]: Surprise butt sex.

3369
03:22:05,228 --> 03:22:06,969
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, how do you feel about that?

3370
03:22:07,469 --> 03:22:08,750
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't care.

3371
03:22:09,490 --> 03:22:11,991
[SPEAKER_28]: Bradley, I know how I'll make the money.

3372
03:22:12,511 --> 03:22:14,232
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll sell all my... Blood.

3373
03:22:14,352 --> 03:22:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just that serious.

3374
03:22:19,284 --> 03:22:21,706
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not the answer, but it's the way he said it.

3375
03:22:21,986 --> 03:22:24,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, this is serious business.

3376
03:22:24,529 --> 03:22:26,410
[SPEAKER_28]: Blood, this is serious business.

3377
03:22:30,634 --> 03:22:31,014
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

3378
03:22:32,355 --> 03:22:34,697
[SPEAKER_28]: Alan, I know how I'll make the money.

3379
03:22:35,198 --> 03:22:37,039
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll sell all my... Battered hilts.

3380
03:22:37,459 --> 03:22:38,540
[SPEAKER_28]: Battered hilts.

3381
03:22:40,925 --> 03:22:41,825
[SPEAKER_28]: Warcraft joke.

3382
03:22:41,905 --> 03:22:42,685
[SPEAKER_28]: I see what you did there.

3383
03:22:42,705 --> 03:22:43,166
[SPEAKER_28]: Good job.

3384
03:22:43,186 --> 03:22:43,526
[SPEAKER_28]: Good job.

3385
03:22:43,886 --> 03:22:44,206
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

3386
03:22:45,466 --> 03:22:48,007
[SPEAKER_28]: And here it is, and I think this is an appropriate final answer.

3387
03:22:48,687 --> 03:22:51,248
[SPEAKER_28]: I know how I'll make the money, Rob thought to himself.

3388
03:22:51,928 --> 03:22:54,348
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll sell all my dignity.

3389
03:22:55,328 --> 03:22:56,689
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

3390
03:22:59,549 --> 03:23:01,250
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, not a match.

3391
03:23:02,785 --> 03:23:03,365
[SPEAKER_28]: Aw.

3392
03:23:03,405 --> 03:23:05,666
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's tally it up.

3393
03:23:06,307 --> 03:23:08,507
[SPEAKER_28]: Just like the Jerry Lewis telethon.

3394
03:23:08,527 --> 03:23:10,448
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, that's going on, isn't it?

3395
03:23:10,468 --> 03:23:12,829
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that's going on right now, and I'm sure it's a lot more entertaining.

3396
03:23:12,849 --> 03:23:13,709
[SPEAKER_28]: And he's still alive.

3397
03:23:13,929 --> 03:23:14,350
[SPEAKER_28]: Good for him.

3398
03:23:14,910 --> 03:23:16,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's look at the big tote board.

3399
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:18,011
[SPEAKER_28]: Drum roll, please.

3400
03:23:18,051 --> 03:23:20,632
[SPEAKER_28]: The big tally is... Oh, oh!

3401
03:23:21,052 --> 03:23:21,652
[SPEAKER_28]: Zero!

3402
03:23:23,393 --> 03:23:25,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Zero to zero.

3403
03:23:25,294 --> 03:23:26,314
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations.

3404
03:23:26,334 --> 03:23:30,296
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's just like football for the World Cups of soccer.

3405
03:23:30,676 --> 03:23:30,936
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

3406
03:23:33,577 --> 03:23:38,222
[SPEAKER_23]: So I win, technically, because obviously I'm the best out of all the zeros.

3407
03:23:38,482 --> 03:23:40,124
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll let you plug something anyway.

3408
03:23:40,164 --> 03:23:43,387
[SPEAKER_28]: And AZHP, if you want to send me a private message, I'll plug whatever you want to plug.

3409
03:23:44,227 --> 03:23:45,829
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you want to plug, Tiara?

3410
03:23:46,474 --> 03:23:53,117
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I will plug Geek Life, which is a blog that I run with a couple of other people, including DarkSakura.

3411
03:23:53,257 --> 03:23:55,478
[SPEAKER_23]: It's geek-life.com.

3412
03:23:55,558 --> 03:23:57,559
[SPEAKER_23]: We do a lot of geeky stuff, sci-fi.

3413
03:23:58,119 --> 03:24:03,242
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a lot of different interesting perspectives on a lot of different stuff.

3414
03:24:03,282 --> 03:24:09,584
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a former military man who's interested in tabletop gaming and stuff like that.

3415
03:24:09,685 --> 03:24:14,687
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have, actually, Sterlok does a column for us where he talks about his experiences as a blind gamer.

3416
03:24:16,008 --> 03:24:27,368
[SPEAKER_23]: Rob Kidman, my doctor he does a tech blog every week and Jamie does some cubicle stuff and geeks and history and all sorts of cool stuff so it's definitely a cool site to check out

3417
03:24:28,211 --> 03:24:29,011
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, check that out.

3418
03:24:29,051 --> 03:24:32,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Geek-life.com And someday when I get motivated, there will be video.

3419
03:24:33,573 --> 03:24:35,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I keep bugging you about that.

3420
03:24:36,053 --> 03:24:36,873
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

3421
03:24:36,933 --> 03:24:40,214
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually shot some video last night, but not enough to make a full blog.

3422
03:24:40,254 --> 03:24:41,575
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'll have to do more later.

3423
03:24:41,795 --> 03:24:46,476
[SPEAKER_28]: But hey, the good news is, now that I have this fancy schmancy iPhone 4, I can do the HD video on the go.

3424
03:24:46,516 --> 03:24:48,397
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's actually really good quality, I gotta say.

3425
03:24:48,437 --> 03:24:49,017
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not gonna lie.

3426
03:24:50,197 --> 03:24:53,158
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, it's better than the $400 camera I bought two years ago.

3427
03:24:53,198 --> 03:24:54,458
[SPEAKER_28]: That's kind of sad, actually.

3428
03:24:55,019 --> 03:24:56,139
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kind of sad about that.

3429
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:58,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Tiara, good luck with the site.

3430
03:24:58,806 --> 03:24:59,548
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one, okay?

3431
03:25:00,310 --> 03:25:01,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, thank you.

3432
03:25:01,293 --> 03:25:01,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye!

3433
03:25:01,714 --> 03:25:02,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye!

3434
03:25:03,664 --> 03:25:05,145
[SPEAKER_28]: and AZHP in chat.

3435
03:25:05,185 --> 03:25:06,105
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I just got it here.

3436
03:25:07,346 --> 03:25:13,450
[SPEAKER_28]: I am organizing my 12,000 MP3s because I ordered the new iPod Touch 4.

3437
03:25:14,210 --> 03:25:21,634
[SPEAKER_28]: Have to plug Music Brains Picard because the program will analyze your MP3 files and attempt to tag them with the correct title, artist, and album.

3438
03:25:22,074 --> 03:25:24,516
[SPEAKER_28]: Works even for my mislabeled pop and music albums.

3439
03:25:24,836 --> 03:25:26,177
[SPEAKER_28]: It's insane how good it is.

3440
03:25:26,277 --> 03:25:27,257
[SPEAKER_28]: Recommend to anyone.

3441
03:25:27,277 --> 03:25:28,278
[SPEAKER_28]: What's it called?

3442
03:25:29,019 --> 03:25:31,602
[SPEAKER_28]: Music Brains Picard, which is a good name for it.

3443
03:25:32,523 --> 03:25:35,748
[SPEAKER_28]: Music Brains with a Z. There you go.

3444
03:25:36,108 --> 03:25:41,195
[SPEAKER_28]: Now the person that I know that is the most anal retentive about their MP3 collection would be Alan.

3445
03:25:41,235 --> 03:25:43,759
[SPEAKER_28]: So would you ever subject your MP3 collection to a program like this?

3446
03:25:44,853 --> 03:25:49,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm too OCD to let anything automated affect my MP3 tags.

3447
03:25:50,776 --> 03:25:57,860
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I could see that it would put the space in the wrong place, and you'd just be like, no!

3448
03:25:58,341 --> 03:26:06,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if it took all of my compilations and unchecked the compilation tag, and like a batch process, I would die.

3449
03:26:06,085 --> 03:26:07,626
[SPEAKER_28]: It'd be over.

3450
03:26:07,926 --> 03:26:08,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

3451
03:26:08,886 --> 03:26:10,047
[SPEAKER_28]: What's ever going to happen if that drive dies?

3452
03:26:10,067 --> 03:26:12,408
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have a backup somehow, or what's going to happen?

3453
03:26:12,428 --> 03:26:13,529
[SPEAKER_28]: A tape backup somehow?

3454
03:26:14,486 --> 03:26:15,928
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

3455
03:26:31,636 --> 03:26:34,097
[SPEAKER_18]: But we have 20 more minutes.

3456
03:26:34,717 --> 03:26:37,438
[SPEAKER_28]: We made it over 10 and a half hours tonight.

3457
03:26:37,498 --> 03:26:38,819
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope you guys enjoyed the marathon.

3458
03:26:38,879 --> 03:26:39,939
[SPEAKER_28]: Next year we just have to top it.

3459
03:26:40,219 --> 03:26:46,281
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully I won't have a show the night before where I have to stay up until 3 in the morning and we can go a little longer.

3460
03:26:46,361 --> 03:26:48,442
[SPEAKER_28]: And DarkSakura won't be taping something in the morning.

3461
03:26:50,023 --> 03:26:54,324
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the after show, honey.

3462
03:26:54,344 --> 03:26:58,626
[SPEAKER_18]: You really should play that one song for X-Link that was going to be my cage match pick.

3463
03:26:58,846 --> 03:26:59,546
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, I'll play it.

3464
03:26:59,826 --> 03:27:00,847
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll play it as we fade to black.

3465
03:27:01,067 --> 03:27:01,947
[SPEAKER_28]: Go back to the all games feed.

3466
03:27:02,447 --> 03:27:06,188
[SPEAKER_18]: But I still have to edit another podcast.

3467
03:27:06,248 --> 03:27:06,748
[SPEAKER_28]: I know you do.

3468
03:27:07,608 --> 03:27:07,908
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

3469
03:27:08,768 --> 03:27:12,929
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, first off, the chatters are yelling because we apparently haven't been going long enough.

3470
03:27:13,029 --> 03:27:18,111
[SPEAKER_28]: And to that I say, oh my God, we've been going for ten and a half hours.

3471
03:27:18,151 --> 03:27:19,571
[SPEAKER_18]: How many people are connected right now?

3472
03:27:19,771 --> 03:27:20,471
[SPEAKER_28]: You savages, 88.

3473
03:27:20,591 --> 03:27:23,612
[SPEAKER_28]: If I'm to believe these numbers I'm looking at.

3474
03:27:25,290 --> 03:27:28,151
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know how the stats work and all that stuff.

3475
03:27:29,031 --> 03:27:29,672
[SPEAKER_28]: But thank you guys.

3476
03:27:29,712 --> 03:27:32,332
[SPEAKER_28]: No, seriously, thank you guys for staying up late with us.

3477
03:27:33,433 --> 03:27:34,733
[SPEAKER_28]: Late with us.

[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you guys rock.

[SPEAKER_28]: But we're getting kind of delirious and I gotta sleep soon.

3480
03:27:37,694 --> 03:27:40,435
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, don't leave us, please.

3481
03:27:40,775 --> 03:27:42,676
[SPEAKER_28]: But we'll be back next week, you guys.

[SPEAKER_18]: Let me look at the chat.

3498
03:28:58,910 --> 03:28:59,150
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

3499
03:29:00,351 --> 03:29:00,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell them no.

3500
03:29:00,971 --> 03:29:02,392
[SPEAKER_28]: Just type N-O, period.

3501
03:29:03,152 --> 03:29:03,993
[SPEAKER_28]: It's very easy.

3502
03:29:04,313 --> 03:29:05,453
[SPEAKER_28]: You have to learn how to say no.

3503
03:29:06,534 --> 03:29:06,854
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

3504
03:29:09,679 --> 03:29:12,024
[SPEAKER_28]: You give them ten and a half hours and it's still not good enough.

3505
03:29:12,625 --> 03:29:14,609
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, DarkSakura is now yelling at chat.

3506
03:29:14,649 --> 03:29:15,591
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, DarkSakura.

3507
03:29:20,871 --> 03:29:46,578
[SPEAKER_28]: I would almost say this is like the longest program in the history of all games but I actually don't think that's true like I actually think all games interactive went longer one week I really do I think they went for like 12 or 13 one week we have to beat those bitches well next year next year we will and we say that endearingly I don't want anyone I don't want somebody running back saying the 11 times radio was calling you guys bitches we love you bitches we love you bitches alright I call everyone my bitches that's right

03:29:48,563 --> 03:30:01,111
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you guys so much for staying up late with us and if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you like what you've heard, you want to support crazy ass independent podcasting, tell a friend about our show or about at least the All Games Network if nothing else.

3509
03:30:01,391 --> 03:30:06,534
[SPEAKER_28]: Help spread the word about independent podcasting because there's a lot of people that work hard to bring this stuff to you guys.

3510
03:30:07,715 --> 03:30:09,436
[SPEAKER_28]: Leave the stream on while we sleep.

3511
03:30:09,496 --> 03:30:10,497
[SPEAKER_28]: That's creepy.

3512
03:30:10,737 --> 03:30:11,117
[SPEAKER_28]: Shut up.

3513
03:30:11,197 --> 03:30:11,457
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

3514
03:30:13,498 --> 03:30:14,839
[SPEAKER_18]: It'd be like Sleep Talking Man.

3515
03:30:14,900 --> 03:30:17,341
[SPEAKER_18]: It's cake o'clock all day long.

3516
03:30:17,401 --> 03:30:19,583
[SPEAKER_28]: Just help us spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

3517
03:30:19,603 --> 03:30:21,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell two friends about the show.

3518
03:30:21,624 --> 03:30:22,625
[SPEAKER_28]: Help us spread the word.

3519
03:30:23,046 --> 03:30:24,026
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's really all we ask.

3520
03:30:24,066 --> 03:30:24,587
[SPEAKER_28]: That's all we want.

3521
03:30:24,647 --> 03:30:28,730
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you didn't like our show, if you thought we sucked, then, well, first off, screw you.

3522
03:30:29,110 --> 03:30:29,691
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm just kidding.

3523
03:30:29,711 --> 03:30:38,518
[SPEAKER_28]: Second off, tune into another show at All Games Radio because there's lots of talented folks there that talk about other games and maybe, you know, we didn't know the answer to the infamous two question.

3524
03:30:39,019 --> 03:30:44,444
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't know a lot about sports games, but I guarantee you there's other shows on the network that will be able to answer those like that.

3525
03:30:44,884 --> 03:30:48,187
[SPEAKER_28]: So check that out at the All Games Network, allgames.com.

3526
03:30:48,687 --> 03:30:52,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Cyber Beast wants to sing us the national anthem of Belgium.

3527
03:30:53,532 --> 03:30:55,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh no, he's going to plug us on national radio in Belgium.

3528
03:30:56,494 --> 03:30:57,474
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome.

3529
03:30:57,494 --> 03:30:58,395
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally misread.

3530
03:30:58,415 --> 03:30:59,615
[SPEAKER_28]: Can we get a tape of that somehow?

3531
03:31:00,176 --> 03:31:01,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I really want to hear that.

3532
03:31:01,896 --> 03:31:02,777
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I want to hear that.

3533
03:31:02,817 --> 03:31:03,817
[SPEAKER_28]: That's going to be awesome.

3534
03:31:04,418 --> 03:31:05,078
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks, you guys.

3535
03:31:05,118 --> 03:31:06,218
[SPEAKER_28]: Dude, we're big in Belgium.

3536
03:31:06,899 --> 03:31:07,999
[SPEAKER_28]: David Hasselhoff, look out.

3537
03:31:08,059 --> 03:31:10,500
[SPEAKER_14]: They can listen to us while they eat their waffles.

3538
03:31:11,521 --> 03:31:13,421
[SPEAKER_14]: While I eat their waffles.

3539
03:31:13,461 --> 03:31:16,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Like that line from Singles to paraphrase, we are loved in Belgium.

3540
03:31:17,216 --> 03:31:17,676
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_28]: Say, Belgium guy is going to record it.

3545
03:31:59,418 --> 03:32:00,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Cyber Beast is our Belgium buddy.

03:32:01,459 --> 03:32:02,020
[SPEAKER_28]: Now I know.

3547
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:04,661
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate it.

3548
03:32:05,161 --> 03:32:06,301
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't go to sleep yet.

3549
03:32:06,341 --> 03:32:07,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I got shit to do.

3550
03:32:08,262 --> 03:32:08,843
[SPEAKER_28]: Are we out?

3551
03:32:09,003 --> 03:32:09,463
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that it?

3552
03:32:09,563 --> 03:32:10,023
[SPEAKER_28]: Good night?

3553
03:32:10,403 --> 03:32:11,003
[SPEAKER_28]: Fade to black?

3555
03:32:11,944 --> 03:32:13,144
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess we're going to play the credits.

3556
03:32:13,344 --> 03:32:15,585
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio.
