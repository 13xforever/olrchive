6451	9013	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
9053	14578	We are live on September the 5th of 2010, a Sunday here with our Orange Lounge Radio Marathon.
15058	18201	We are almost, what, about seven hours in at this point now?
19762	24266	We started at about 2.05, and it's now 8.50 on the West Coast here where we tape.
24906	32733	You can listen live, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and I imagine that's what most of you are doing, because the podcast, you'd have to be way, way, way into that now to get to this point.
33253	33393	So...
34734	39917	Anyhow, we were going to do some news here, and I was going to open the Skype line again here in just a moment, so we'll have that again open.
40537	42818	If you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
42938	43779	Not just yet.
43859	44900	I'm going to open it here in a moment.
45840	56225	But we had another question, I guess, come in on Ask Orange Lounge or something that slipped through the cracks, and I thought it was a pretty good question, so I apologize to bother Alan mid-chew there, but do you remember what that question was all about?
56506	57326	The extra question we got?
57806	62849	Which game or system did you pass up on when it came out that you never bought that you now regret?
63922	67144	I thought there was also a question, what system do you regret buying, too?
68044	69625	Okay, well, let's do both.
70265	77348	What system do you regret buying, and what thing do you wish you hadn't passed up, I guess that would be?
78989	79049	Um...
80646	82888	Saga Dreamcast Saga Dreamcast Saga Dreamcast
103584	105505	So that would probably be my answer.
106205	107185	I did get one when they were like $40.
107365	108906	Remember when they cut the price down to like $40?
109006	112267	Or at least GameStop was just trying to unload them or something.
112847	116408	Because at that point you could do all the NES emulators on the Dreamcast and all that stuff.
116448	117789	It was really cool.
118229	120470	So that's when I finally got on the Dreamcast bandwagon.
120490	121950	But it was a little bit too late.
123491	125531	And keep in mind, guys, the Skype line is not open yet.
125571	126872	So if you're calling in, hold off.
127192	128992	We'll get to the calls a little later here in the program.
129793	129953	Alan?
133896	143399	I actually was able to buy an original edition of Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Saturn, which came out well after the Saturn was dead.
145279	151421	I bought it, took the bus after school to go to the mall, dropped the 70 or 80 bucks for it.
153027	179319	I ended up selling it for a killing on eBay like two years later I never touched it so I bought it never played it and Panzer Dragoon Saga is one of the greatest RPGs especially for the Saturn and I sold it on eBay for like 200 something bucks and I needed the money but it's like why did I do that like I had I just walked into the store and bought it I never touched it you could play ours if you want
180559	192767	The N64 I got for Ocarina of Time because at that age I was very elitist and snobby about CD-ROM versus card and how Nintendo was making the wrong decision.
194568	200212	I bought an N64 just for Ocarina of Time and I never really played any other game aside from that.
200252	202314	I bought a bunch of games for the N64 and never touched them.
203014	204795	So that was probably a waste of money.
205416	205556	Okay.
208294	210936	Now you're talking the games you regret buying, right?
211276	212437	Yeah, those are my two for that.
212577	218282	Do you have any for the one that I had answered about the system or game you regret not buying?
220684	226248	I really wish I could have checked out the TurboGrafx, but that was a bit out of my league at the time.
226690	229031	My friend had one, and at the time, I thought it was kind of stupid.
229271	229911	I gotta be honest.
230091	231652	The games I played on it were not that great.
232452	238695	We played Splatterhouse, which was kind of cool, in the fact that it was Splatterhouse, and it was kind of like a horror movie type game.
238735	241396	But otherwise, I didn't find the games on it to be that great.
242656	246638	And to this day, I gotta admit, I know DarkSakura's got a lot of love for it.
246678	247698	Maybe it's because she's out of the room.
247738	248698	I'll dare to say this.
249118	250939	I still kind of think the whole thing was kind of overrated.
251119	253080	It wasn't that great of a system, I don't think.
253308	261572	Well, it was the only system that got the original Street Fighter, and it also got, you know, Castlevania X, the lost Castlevania game until recently.
261980	265383	And that's cool, but, you know, how many of us actually played that?
265543	267805	I mean, sure, Jamie did, but she's, you know, cray-cray.
268226	268486	Yeah.
268506	268906	In a good way.
269106	274111	Aside from that, all the systems that were even a little bit relevant, I had at one point, I did get a Genesis.
274251	279055	I got it years after everyone else, but I got it before the PlayStation 1 came out.
281037	284240	The 32X and the Sega CD were all considered failures, so...
285905	288267	You know, don't really have much regrets there.
289108	291169	I have the original Lunar on a ROM.
291209	292230	I can play it on my computer.
294452	305020	For me, the system that I regret buying, like not, don't, or regret not buying, but the system I regret buying that I kind of wish I hadn't was a second DS.
306281	311065	I had a DS Fat and then the original DS and then I bought a DS Lite and I don't think I really needed that Lite.
311085	312046	You don't handheld game at all.
312586	313487	PSP Fat PSP Fat PSP Fat
332518	360881	I did and I ended up getting a PSP 3000 as well but you know what I actually would play the PSP probably more than I did the DS just the certain games that were on it with Luminous and the Final Fantasy remakes and so forth I mean don't get me wrong the DS had its games too but I don't know also the PSP 1 I kind of wore it down and it didn't work as well anymore so it kind of justified for me the PSP 3000 even though that's probably not like the greatest reason to have one if that makes sense but yeah
361434	371301	I know the idea of buying a movie on UMD is kind of ridiculous, but if you can get Kill Bill on UMD, it fries for like five bucks.
371361	373923	That's got a better screen on it than your iPhone does, really.
374143	374423	Oh, yeah.
374923	375764	To watch a movie on that.
376244	376645	Good stuff.
377505	385511	DarkSakura, we're talking about the system or console you regret most buying, and then the one you regret not buying.
389298	390798	I don't really have anything that I regret buying.
390838	394619	I guess if I was going to pick one, it'd be the GameCom because it was awful.
395760	399280	I don't even regret the N-Gage because I had some good stuff on there.
399420	407202	But as far as things I regret not buying... You know, it's funny.
407262	410143	Robert M. in chat gave the same answer almost at the same time.
410183	410863	The GameCom.
411123	411803	This is where you're at.
413444	413584	I'm...
417915	418135	Bradley?
418155	418415	Bradley?
445214	446035	Okay, let's see.
446355	449097	What I regret probably not buying was I never got a Dreamcast.
449698	453701	I hear all the great stories about it, and I just never got around to it.
453941	454241	I don't know.
454261	456303	I think this might have been the time.
456323	460846	I didn't have a job at the time, so I couldn't get it.
461186	463128	The system was truly ahead of its time.
463248	468973	If it had come out like two years later with DVD support, I honestly think it would have whooped the PlayStation 2.
469733	471054	I really, truly think that.
471254	472335	I know I'm crazy, but I do.
473256	473396	Yeah.
473536	479021	I don't think there's any systems that I regret buying because I think I like all my systems that I have.
479041	491432	His story about Panzer Dragoon reminds me, I actually had to sell mine off because I had no money at the time and I really regret doing that and really didn't want to buy it back.
492413	500039	I actually did win an auction for it on eBay for like 200-something bucks, but the guy never shipped it, which was really annoying.
500059	504103	He kept saying he was going to ship it, but he didn't, and he gave him like a fake code or something.
504223	510069	But since I did it through PayPal, I was able to get the money back, at least for that, so I can see if I can find it again sometime.
511530	516895	The game I regret buying was the sequel to Alex Kidd and Miracle World.
516915	519077	I can't remember what it was called, Alex Kidd 2 something.
519617	523199	is just because it... I'll say what in Miracle World is a great game.
523760	526762	It takes a while to get through it and it takes a while to figure it out.
527142	536968	Because I played it again like a few years ago and I couldn't get through it because there's like some spikes and stuff in the last few levels that can be kind of hard to get past.
538409	541971	But the second game is like, it's a really easy... Instead of having like...
543974	551016	It's, it doesn't, it's not like the map like the first one has and, and the first one, first one is not exactly as linear, it's not linear.
551976	556538	It's because you can go, or it's not left to, just left to right is left to right and then you're up and down depending on the level.
556998	561119	But on, in the second game, you only go left to right and it's actually a really easy game.
561779	566081	And I beat, I beat it the first, first, first day and it's like really disappointing.
566881	569962	Just a bit, pretty much because of how great the first game was.
572583	572923	All right.
573483	574224	Good answers, guys.
574804	575064	All right.
575984	577545	I think we're going to do some quick news stories.
577765	581987	We had a couple left over that we never got around to, and then we actually have some other discussion topics.
582867	588910	So, DarkSakura, I don't know if you have the piece on the last one that we had left over that we didn't get to before dinner.
589030	589230	Oh, good.
589250	589910	About Telltale.
591851	599414	Basically, Telltale's doing a five-episode Back to the Future series, and it's going to have Marty McFly and Doc Brown.
599434	601875	It has Christopher Lloyd voicing Doc Brown, which is great.
602515	623159	and Hill Valley being 1985 and guidance from the screenwriter Bob Gale and the DeLorean so they're still working on getting the rest of it up but there's still a bit missing you know I guess what hoverboards and Huey Lewis in the news
623840	626401	I'm looking forward to seeing what the actual game looks like.
626762	629903	We've heard a lot of talk about the game and kind of ramping up to it.
630264	633725	I'm kind of excited to see what the damn thing actually looks like, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
633746	634666	I have some trivia for you.
634806	635887	You can kind of guess.
636387	637207	Can I tell you a secret?
638208	640629	A lot of people are going to judge me for this, but I don't really care.
642050	643671	I have never seen Back to the Future 1 or 2.
644031	644732	We can fix that.
645252	646192	But I have seen Part 3.
646593	647133	Isn't that weird?
647633	648554	The Wild West one, right?
648574	649634	I saw 1 and then I saw 3.
649914	651195	I didn't see 2 for the longest time.
651635	652276	I never saw 1 or 2.
653666	656128	But Rob, here's some trivia for you.
656228	662694	On the Back to the Future pinball table, you know that Michael J. Fox would not allow his likeness to be used, so they made a generic looking dude.
663654	665616	I think I know that because you've brought it up on the show before.
665816	666777	Actually, true story.
667197	667638	True story.
668678	669798	All right.
670458	676960	One other story for you guys, and it has to do with the Connect Beta is going on right now, of course.
677820	679421	They're starting to ship out and all that good stuff.
680641	682741	Someone is trying to sell theirs on eBay.
683041	689283	They're trying to get $1,200 for it, but it was quickly taken offline.
689763	693864	I'm assuming Microsoft sent a cease and desist to the kind folks at eBay.
695125	699050	So probably Microsoft did not take kindly to the fact that the unit was being sold.
699651	705178	The seller on eBay was Blue Room Project and there were no bids actually made on the system.
705519	706120	So there it was.
708467	718913	What's interesting about it though is that I would think that this, and the article kind of gets into this too, is that you would think these connects are going to be sending back quite a bit of data to Microsoft servers.
718954	723176	So it could kind of figure out who's playing connect that shouldn't be, right?
723576	732262	Like if you get a connect early, aren't you kind of setting yourself up for trouble unless you never sign on to Xbox Live, which I guess you could do, but then how would you get the patches and all that stuff?
732302	734043	It just seems tricky, tricky.
734563	750110	I wish Loki was here to explain a little more about how you could get around that but I'm just thinking, you know what, probably not a good idea to just buy these that you don't really have the rights because Microsoft can track what goes online and you're going to have to go online to get some of the patches and updates so it just doesn't make sense.
752711	753611	That was it for the news.
753651	757053	That was all the news we had set to cover this show.
757473	761235	So if you have more stories you want to talk about, we're actually going to open up the Skype line.
761335	762235	Now it is open, folks.
762255	765616	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
765636	766517	We're going to take some more calls.
767357	771139	So you can either call us and talk to us about a news story or really anything you've heard about tonight.
772219	777441	Or you can send us a tweet at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
777961	779042	You can send us a tweet.
780643	785306	And we'll read those again in a little bit if we're getting some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
785646	790630	And I think DarkSakura had mentioned something about wanting to do the mailbag again, but I don't know if any letters have dropped in.
791030	794493	But we're kind of monitoring all those pretty closely right now.
794553	797075	I'm actually going to kind of load up the tweets.
797095	799857	Let's see how those are going.
799877	800877	All right, we are getting some calls.
800917	801578	Let's go to the phones.
803039	804080	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
804100	804480	Who's this?
805140	806021	Hey, this is X-Link.
806161	806742	Hey, X-Link.
806762	808203	Welcome to Hour 7 of the marathon.
808243	808623	How are you doing?
809266	810127	Doing good, and you?
810987	812308	I'm still awake, that's a good thing.
812448	813029	What's on your mind?
814670	815271	Nothing much.
815731	823017	Yeah, I'm really excited to hear that they are going to do a miniseries based on Back to the Future, which is hopefully going to be epic.
823097	829482	Now they're getting actual actors to do the voices from the movie and stuff, so that's pretty cool.
829642	832844	I would love to see Michael J. Fox to come on also, because that would be excellent.
832904	833144	Yeah.
835371	842793	Also, Telltale also got cited for because they announced a new poker game coming out this fall with different characters from different game series.
843933	857077	Poker Night at the Inventory with Tycho from Penny Arcade, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Max from Sandman Max, and then the Heavy from Team Fortress 2.
858775	881916	so that should be pretty interesting of a poker game when they get that all said and done yeah we to be fair it was brought up about six hours ago but yeah we did talk about it a little bit but um it sounds kind of interesting i'm not usually like a somebody that gets like super into the uh poker games but um i kind of like where this one's going it's an interesting hodgepodge of characters what do you kind of hope you get out of this poker game
882617	883718	Just the wackiness.
884078	892002	Because of Telltale and the way they're going to put this together, there's going to be some kind of epic fighting going on between characters and stuff, which is going to be absolutely great to see.
893763	896825	That's the over-slapstick humor that they usually do with some of their games.
897645	898185	Good times.
900587	900987	Awesome.
901287	902508	So what else is on your mind?
902568	902888	Anything?
904565	907647	No, I've been playing a lot of WoW, as of course you should know.
907787	909849	Of course, because I play a lot of WoW too.
910229	910589	Fancy that.
910609	911730	Yeah, we all do.
912470	914392	What are some of your WoW accomplishments recently?
915448	919891	Um, almost had the, uh, TOC 25, which I would have been very proud of.
920491	926815	Um, uh, you know, just a lot of different odds and ends, uh, ICC getting farther than that now in the 10 man.
926895	938001	So, uh, the guild, um, you know, just, and hopefully I'm really going to be proud because I'm going to try to go for some of the other odds and ends like the fishing mounts and stuff like that.
938061	938941	So awesome.
940842	941043	Yeah.
941623	941763	So, um,
943226	943626	Alright.
944086	946447	Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go and take more calls?
947428	948408	Nope, that's pretty much about it.
949028	949649	Well, you have a good night.
949689	950349	Good luck with WoW.
951029	951329	Thank you.
951389	951650	You too.
951730	952290	Alright, bye.
953630	955991	Alright.
956011	959533	1877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
959593	961754	You can give us a call.
964275	964615	Alright.
967434	970095	I was just ringing off the hook a minute ago, so I'm hoping more calls will come in.
970135	971196	We are getting some tweets.
971256	971796	Thank you guys.
971876	973097	Twitter.com slash OLR.
973117	974758	We'll get to those in just a moment.
977179	979520	How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?
979540	979980	Are you good?
981000	981961	Yeah, I'm a little boozy.
985387	985947	From the drinking?
986408	987048	Yeah.
987108	988209	I'm starting to get a little like, hey.
988249	989510	Brandy hits me really fast.
989570	990211	I don't care.
990231	990611	All right.
990631	991912	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
991932	992272	Who's this?
993413	994954	Hi, this is Spazinator.
995034	995955	Hey, Spazinator.
995975	996775	Welcome to the marathon.
996795	997356	What's on your mind?
999337	999818	Yeah.
999838	1008464	Well, this is probably a question that's probably better answered by Loki, but since he took off a few hours ago, I'll ask you guys.
1009305	1014509	I'm kind of sort of toying around with the idea of...
1015615	1021459	more or less recreating an arcade kit that I once saw going years back.
1022080	1025562	I don't know if you've ever seen this one particular model.
1025582	1036389	It had Samurai Shodown 4 in it and basically the configuration was it came in two pieces.
1036970	1039412	One section had the
1041977	1045078	Joysticks and the buns and the coin slots and all that.
1045478	1050940	And maybe the second piece was basically the modern.
1050960	1054741	That was like five or ten feet away.
1055081	1058802	And there was like a set of chains licking the two together.
1059222	1060243	Wait, wait, wait.
1060263	1061003	You got to back up here.
1061403	1064544	This was a special machine or a custom machine you're saying?
1065600	1074985	Yeah, I think I'm more or less recreating at least part of the custom machine for myself.
1075545	1084070	At least the control, the part with the controls on it.
1084290	1094896	Aside from the part with the controls like the joystick and all that, I was wondering, what kind of materials do you think I should be...
1096184	1101991	using to build the cabinet itself, like, should I use, like, particle board and laminate, or...
1103024	1123478	Yeah, this is definitely a Loki question because I don't know anything about this stuff, but I will tell you one somewhat cheap alternative that I've heard being used before is actually trying to find old arcade cabinets that, for whatever reason, the games inside them don't work anymore because the cabinets seem to make pretty good shells for these custom cabinets for whatever it is you're trying to build, a Samurai Shodown 4 case or whatever it is.
1124618	1131863	Those are usually a really good place to start, at least from what I've heard, and I think that's what quite a few people have done.
1133191	1135252	DarkSakura, don't you guys have a custom cabinet?
1136713	1140196	We just modified a pole position back in the day.
1141096	1146900	And used it and put a... Dan built the layout and everything with the buttons and joysticks.
1148621	1156366	Otherwise, as far as specific materials that work best, not really my realm of expertise because I've never built a cabinet, so I'm not going to profess to know that stuff.
1156926	1158227	But I'm sure there are some websites.
1158867	1160849	Yeah, Loki's a good resource when he's here.
1161429	1162530	When he's not babysitting.
1163765	1173272	Ultimately, my goal is to, let's say, to use this as just an example.
1173752	1191724	I was thinking of getting one of those $150 arcade sticks for the PS3 or 360, drop that into the cabinet, run the arcade stick flyers to my game system, and then try to have my...
1202790	1207253	Well, I know that Loki was also going to be working on a project about building arcade cabinets for like a hundred bucks.
1207473	1210234	So, you know, I'm all about building on a budget.
1210274	1210775	That's for sure.
1211855	1213396	All right.
1213436	1214957	Well, thanks for taking my call.
1215517	1215877	All right.
1216698	1217038	All right.
1217338	1217778	Have a good one.
1217878	1218399	You too, buddy.
1218479	1218899	Have a good night.
1219878	1220118	YouTube
1246758	1249899	Legend of Zaku from your cell phone Oh wow, you guys are really pushing it this time, aren't you?
1276624	1277785	Yeah, a little bit.
1280167	1283530	We haven't done a show this long since DDR tournaments, that's for sure.
1285031	1285552	Right.
1286092	1293519	So yeah, apparently the biggest thing right now is Duke Nukem Forever basically coming back from the dead in a more spectacular way.
1294159	1295841	I never thought it would actually happen.
1296321	1299564	Oh yes, what do you think about all this news that has come out of Penny Arcade Expo?
1301081	1314287	All I know is that they better just stick to the schedule and get it out because the last thing we need is for other folks to just have this game be the butt of everyone's joke again.
1315368	1320730	At the same time though, at this point, Zaku, what's another year?
1321411	1324732	If they delay it to 2012, what's another year at this point?
1325893	1327333	But the game is so close.
1327394	1330395	I mean, people are already playing a demo of it and
1331168	1333355	What I hear is like at polishing stages.
1334518	1335060	No, I get it.
1335100	1335561	It's just like.
1336804	1337224	I agree.
1337264	1343428	If they're showing it on the floor at Penny Arcade Expo, it's darn close to done.
1343488	1348590	Showing it at Penny Arcade Expo, keep in mind, they bypassed E3 to make this announcement.
1349071	1353873	If this has been in development since 2009, they could have announced this at E3, but they didn't.
1354313	1358956	They went and took it directly to people like you and me at Penny Arcade Expo.
1359016	1363318	That's like unzipping it and whipping it out on the table for everybody to admire.
1363438	1363638	That's...
1365299	1369362	Then again, this game actually appeals to the hardcore demographic.
1370223	1382574	Not necessarily something you would want, you know, average Joe gamer who pretty much doesn't have a clue as to what Duke Nukem is, unless they have been playing during the, you know, mid to late 90s.
1385199	1385519	Pretty much.
1385539	1388422	I mean, the whole point is that, I guess, I kind of find it surprising that the first, you know,
1410189	1419491	The studio behind Borderlands and the guy who founded it pretty much has a connection to 3D Realms and the folks who ran it up until its demise.
1420611	1424672	I never thought that guy's career is pretty much owed to Duke Nukem.
1425433	1430874	Well, now I'm wondering, though, if they knew that they had this game, that Gearbox has had this game since 2009.
1430974	1433634	When did Duke Nukem come out?
1433674	1434975	Didn't it come out about a year ago?
1434995	1435375	I guess...
1436485	1442531	I mean, all I know is that basically, when I read in the article, like a Taco article where they interviewed, you know, that guy, basically...
1460954	1466656	After 3D Realms shut down, most of it was pretty much a two-bit operation running from people's apartments.
1467476	1471877	Pretty much a garage game up until a point where Gearbox took control of it.
1473538	1476519	It was pretty much coming together piecemeal.
1476619	1487582	So there's no way you would mount something unless you have a solid backing from a developer who's able to actually finish the job instead of putting it through development hell.
1488968	1489168	Oh yeah.
1489188	1490568	Well, I mean, you know, again, it's been shown now.
1490608	1492989	It's something that is actually going to come out.
1493009	1494590	So we'll, you know, see what happens.
1518951	1519291	Right.
1520311	1523612	And hopefully everything will make sense.
1524833	1528114	And at least I could hear more one-liners out of this guy.
1529774	1531475	That's pretty much what OLR needs.
1531575	1535036	A lot more Duke Nukem one-liners out of nowhere.
1536876	1537196	I don't know.
1537216	1539317	The soundboard is kind of saved for special occasions.
1539477	1539877	We'll see.
1540457	1542258	And real quick, a comment from our chatroom.
1542278	1546239	Derek H is asking, is the caller saying that 3D Realms was a garage development house?
1547498	1566229	No, I'm just saying that after 3D Realms blew up because of Duke Nukem Forever's development, the folks from 3D Realms, in the transition to Gearbox, in between that time, started working on Duke Nukem Forever from their apartment.
1566249	1575014	So some of it during that time with 3D Realms' demise, until it got handed over to Gearbox, was pretty much a two-bit operation.
1576048	1579632	I know 3D Realms is pretty much a big name studio back in the day.
1582015	1585159	They turned out a lot of PC titles that I'm pretty much fond of.
1593877	1594898	I think it's going to be great.
1595238	1604203	The only thing that's going to be sad is that since it's not just like Borderlands, you're not going to get quests in Duke Nukem as far as I know, so it won't be like, hey, you need to go up to the stripper and tipper.
1605244	1607845	Although I guess you do have to press R to pee in the toilet.
1609286	1620432	No, the whole point of Duke Nukem is just pick up and play, kill people, max out on your... try to get all the power-ups and weapons and just go all out with
1620957	1625201	That's the whole point, is that you're just killing, you're just shooting people, like Doom.
1625902	1629705	But instead, you're just like, you know, you're killing a lot more aliens and monsters.
1630846	1631106	Alright.
1631487	1632808	And with a lot of one-liners.
1633268	1639173	Alright, well, Zaku, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but I hope you can get your hands on Duke Nukem soon, and see it's the real thing.
1639353	1639614	Alright.
1640414	1640635	Later.
1640975	1643057	Have a good one.
1643077	1645219	877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
1645239	1646179	We got another call coming in.
1646219	1647120	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1647140	1647441	Who's this?
1648598	1651801	Hey, this is DJ Blaziken.
1651861	1668716	Not much other than I've been listening to this whole marathon shindig since it started up and the whole music break thing is bringing me back to the old days, back from the really old episode that I started listening to you guys back on your old station.
1669588	1671970	Well, I'm glad to hear it.
1672010	1673531	That's kind of the idea behind it.
1673571	1680577	Now, for those that are listening on the podcast, we can't do the copyrighted music that we were playing during our little breaks here for meals and potty and all that stuff.
1681018	1682359	But yeah, we're playing a lot of the music.
1682679	1696451	When Orange Launch Radio, back when we were a station on Live 365, we would play music from DDR and just a variety of the other music-based games and some of the Dance Mania CDs that inspired the music song list in DDR and so forth.
1697572	1707414	Yeah, which, of all things, okay, I've been a little bit on a Jersey Shore fanatic point, so I've been fist-pumping throughout the whole breaks.
1708274	1708994	Wow.
1709475	1711735	I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that about this program.
1712275	1713435	There's a first for everything.
1713495	1724978	Hey, by the way, actually, just thinking of systems I regret not buying, systems I do regret buying, um,
1728391	1735593	Somehow, I regret not buying a Sega Dreamcast myself.
1736473	1739134	And, actually, you know what?
1739314	1746676	Outside of the second system, I regret not buying, because I had a kick-ass fighting game on it, was the N64.
1747716	1754638	Which, it had killer instinct, and the controller itself, the standard controller, was perfect for fighting games.
1755271	1758394	I have to admit, I got used to Street Fighter on a Super Nintendo controller.
1758414	1762677	The whole fact that some of the punches and kicks were shoulder buttons totally didn't bother me.
1762697	1763458	I was able to get used to it.
1763478	1767461	Did you ever remember the Capcom controller that they came out for the Super Nintendo?
1767982	1768062	Ooh.
1782173	1783534	No, and I thought that was on the Genesis.
1784894	1785854	They did it in Japan.
1786334	1791876	The six button controller where you held part of it in your hand and you played with the top of your fingers.
1794417	1795677	It was kind of uncomfortable.
1796577	1797298	Yeah, it sounds it.
1798638	1809021	And on top of that, a game I regret not buying, but I've actually got to play, well, I now finally got to buy and own, is Full Calibur.
1810301	1838824	Dreamcast good stuff I wish I had Goldeneye too cause god I mean occasionally my friend would bring it over to the daycare occasionally and he'd bring it over to N64 and we'd all just sit down four player multiplayer it was just epicness and even though I never owned it it was just like god I wish I could plop some money down on that and now that I think about it
1840067	1866774	a game that I do regret buying wow it would have to be DDR Disney Channel Edition you must have been a real DDR completionist to get that yeah it's another DDR worthy of the whole old bumper from Step Squad saying this DDR sucks saying to Solo
1867463	1869184	Actually, Solo was actually pretty good.
1870744	1871765	Solo was awesome.
1871785	1875346	That was some of the best music they had in DDR ever, especially Solo 2000.
1875386	1876747	It was amazing.
1877867	1883610	Yeah, I think my arcade had the Solo 2000, but stupid idiots trade for Pump It Up.
1885347	1886067	Not even the second.
1886568	1893851	I want to back up real quick, because you were talking about the Dreamcast and missing out on that and everything, which was the same thing I said for the system that I kind of regret not buying.
1893871	1901796	But then I also think about it, and it's like, you know, at that time in my life, there was no way I could have paid that type of money for that system.
1901876	1906318	You know, I was barely out of college, and I didn't really have a job.
1906398	1909139	I mean, I sort of worked temp jobs in the summer and so forth.
1909420	1911200	There was no way I would have been able to afford one.
1911341	1911521	So...
1912421	1918723	I regret not being able to afford it, I guess, but I couldn't buy it.
1919143	1924685	I guess I can't say I don't regret not buying one because I was able to buy food and other things.
1925925	1936848	Actually, contrary to the whole gym casting, the babysitter my mom sent me to a bunch of times, he had a bunch of systems to play and six or seven arcade games.
1937763	1943889	Mortal Kombat 2, Asteroids, Snow Bros, and Defender I was like 6, 7, 10 Yeah, and Mortal Kombat 4 He had Final Doom on the Playstation I played that a lot
1964005	1970207	Actually, when one of his friends would come over, we'd link up the two playstations to play four-player Final Doom.
1970968	1977830	And, once again, FPS Epicness, which, that's why I ended up buying, what was it?
1978416	1985640	I ended up buying Doom on Xbox Live and Soul Calibur Am I the only one that's like what's wrong with this picture?
1985760	1992803	Why is the six year old being allowed to play Mortal Kombat 2 and Doom when he's with the Manny?
1994144	2006910	I don't get that But the cool thing was not only that did I play it in his house but on the occasions I'd go over to the mall and then my mom she was searching for me
2007304	2026899	and so she knew I was in the arcade section of the mall at the time and this is the same mall that won't fix their ITG machine it's still down which sucks but at the time they had a Mortal Kombat 4 arcade machine and I would play that constantly because there was only one token to play and how old were you, 8?
2029000	2035005	I was 10 and actually the first game I ever got actually the first game system I ever got was a Game Boy
2035979	2037240	Game Boy Pocket.
2037820	2053811	The first two games I got, one was a combo game cartridge, Mortal Kombat 1 and 2, and the other was Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back, which I loved the cantina song that would play whenever the characters were bringing up dialogue.
2054686	2058229	And those games didn't screw you up as a kid?
2058289	2059210	Like, you're fine now?
2059250	2060771	You have a good sense of reality?
2060851	2062432	You're stable mentally and all that good stuff?
2062452	2062912	Yeah, pretty much.
2062932	2066515	Like, my mom was like, it's too violent, blah, blah, blah.
2066575	2067836	It'll make you go crazy.
2067936	2068637	I'm like, really?
2069097	2081066	And I bought GTA Liberty City Stories behind her back on Amazon for a PSP hacking point because it was used to get the hen to activate.
2081894	2085415	but it ended up not working as well as I thought the hack would work.
2086276	2090017	But I just had fun with that and she never knew about it.
2091678	2097820	Have you told your mom recently about all these things you were playing behind her back when you were growing up?
2098180	2106563	She kind of figured out after a while what I was playing but she didn't care by the time I was... She was like, here's the good thing.
2107123	2109504	I didn't become that stupid Virginia Tech...
2110427	2113869	Shooter, or the Von Maher Shooter, which you probably might have heard about.
2114109	2116531	Yeah, I've heard about them.
2117452	2120153	And, you know, I didn't go out and shoot at the high school.
2120173	2122895	I didn't go out with a sniper rifle and shoot a bunch of people.
2123575	2132301	If I felt like I wanted to deck someone in the face, I waited until I got home or got on the bus, started up GTA, and started beating up random civilians in games.
2133482	2134663	That was my anchor management.
2134863	2142888	I like what Hoofhearted says in chat, saying, My father didn't care that I played MK, but my mom got scared and said, You're going to live with your auntie in Bel-Air.
2146850	2147170	All right.
2147911	2151293	Blaze, I've got to let you go so we can try and get some more calls and do more Marathon.
2151453	2152113	But thank you for the call.
2152293	2153194	One last thing.
2155115	2160758	Okay, basically the PSP in of itself is almost like a Super Nintendo controller in of itself with a screen.
2161438	2162439	Just with an analog stick.
2164451	2176808	and Alpha 3 Max plays fine and I go between that and Street Fighter 4 and I'm looking to get in the EVO tournament one day and beat Daigel Well good luck to you
2178834	2180836	Alright, peace out, and have a good rockin' show.
2181156	2182056	We will, we'll try.
2182697	2182997	Later!
2183877	2185218	Thanks for being a part of the marathon.
2186159	2189100	That was kind of a marathon phone call here on the Village Lounge Radio Marathon.
2190001	2193423	Ah, we can probably do one or two more, whatever, I got nothing else to do.
2194204	2194604	Let's see.
2195025	2196427	I'm trying to look in our chat room.
2196467	2199472	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which is still pretty full here.
2201415	2201996	Let's see.
2202376	2203017	What was the question?
2203138	2207004	Oh, BetaCNCRA was asking, why is the show only on Sundays?
2207084	2208386	Why can't it be on every day?
2208925	2210166	We have this thing called lives.
2210506	2212248	Yeah, that and a job.
2212608	2214589	And this show doesn't pay us anything.
2215090	2218592	In fact, we actually pay to do this show.
2219053	2220554	Although we don't pay very much anymore.
2220574	2221975	We don't have to pay for a feed anymore.
2222575	2224957	The fine folks at All Games Radio help subsidize that.
2225938	2228980	But wait until I can show you the bill for our mixing board.
2229301	2229461	Yeah.
2230141	2231142	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2231162	2231542	Who's this?
2232583	2233544	Yeah, hello there.
2233604	2234084	Good evening.
2234104	2234545	Good morning.
2234585	2235425	Good morning.
2238306	2242068	It's that Swede, who's been with you all this time.
2242248	2244049	Good morning to you, my friend.
2244109	2247371	So, gosh, when we started, it was probably, what, like midnight where you are?
2248572	2250553	No, it was... What was it?
2250653	2252474	If I remember... No, no, no.
2252534	2254114	It was like 11 o'clock or something.
2254475	2255195	Well, that's not too bad.
2256436	2258637	If I remember... We've been going for seven hours now.
2258697	2259597	So, seven and a half.
2259657	2260178	Oh, my God.
2260318	2261038	Seven and a half hours.
2261078	2261578	So, do the math.
2262759	2263820	Oh, well... Whatever.
2265639	2268181	But, oh, well, what was I going to say?
2268261	2283412	Well, yeah, Mass Effect is kind of interesting, almost, in that sense that, well, finally, DLC for that game will show up.
2285073	2287915	Oh, yeah, because that's right, Mass Effect 2, right?
2288315	2290377	Has it had a lot of download content come out?
2291738	2294760	DLC that you actually want to buy, because...
2296664	2301146	Well, because that backstory with the Shadow Broker is like, winner!
2302767	2302947	Huh.
2302987	2303267	Really.
2304408	2306489	Nice.
2306709	2310571	And I already have actually read the comic for it.
2312932	2315953	The Mass Effect Redemption comic.
2316454	2323818	What do you think about... Which takes place actually around that, before Mass Effect, around that time when...
2325501	2329925	Well, it takes place, like, before Mass Effect 2.
2330525	2334048	Mass Effect movie would be kinda nice in some way, but...
2355774	2361258	Well, my problem though is that my Shepard is not male.
2361278	2363360	She's female.
2365522	2366843	Shepard is female.
2367123	2367703	Point!
2368144	2370065	Shepard can be whoever you want them to be.
2370125	2370746	That is true.
2370986	2371486	That is true.
2371927	2377011	You know, completely not what you were asking, but I only play female characters in Warcraft.
2378083	2379204	because people treat you better.
2379804	2405717	Well, so do I. Even though the ironic thing about that front is that, well, I didn't get to max level at... I didn't get to max level that soon, actually, because I, like... I didn't hit max level, but then I think I did at some point.
2405937	2406177	Anyway...
2406590	2409897	Yeah, because I mostly played female characters, too.
2410418	2411580	And what happens?
2411821	2416931	Well, I roll a troll male and I hit max level.
2419273	2446343	it's funny the characters you will get most invested in out of everything else I gotta read this comment from chat real quick DDR Dollar says in our chat room this caller reminds me of when I was younger and said the avatar from Ultima was female you know yeah when I played Ultima Quest for the Avatar on the NES usually like half of the different class types you could get were females and I think usually the one I would opt to play is like the druid I think or the shepherdess and both were female
2448043	2452405	Unfortunately, I can't think of any system that I regret buying in some way.
2474597	2479523	because I don't get any of my system buys, unfortunately.
2480164	2485711	The only thing I might regret is that I smashed two Game Boys in my time.
2485771	2486091	I really...
2489850	2497797	One of them was play, and I actually know the two games that I did play.
2498197	2505723	Well, first of it was that I smashed my original Game Boy while I was playing Kirby's Pinball Land.
2506844	2508345	That game was awesome.
2509486	2514831	The other time was when I smashed my other Game Boy Pocket.
2515546	2518108	playing Wario Land for some strange reason.
2518368	2521290	Those Nintendo pinball games were so freaking good, though.
2521490	2524092	Like, the Pokemon pinball was so awesome.
2524873	2525834	I used to play that on it.
2525874	2527995	I don't think I would have broke a Game Boy over it, but, you know.
2529716	2533639	Oh, but here's the other thing, though.
2533779	2536521	I have... Oh, but here's the other thing, though.
2536701	2542826	I was much younger at that time because I was like 12 or something when I...
2543502	2544623	I think we lost the connection there.
2544643	2544963	That's a bummer.
2544983	2547264	I hope we didn't lose the whole damn internet again.
2574059	2574499	Okay, good.
2574559	2577740	No, it's still showing us connected and I see the chat room going there, so we're good.
2578201	2581162	Well, unfortunately, we lost Hockey Ripper, but Anger Management.
2581242	2582422	I want to talk about this, actually.
2582842	2591165	Let's talk about your most angry video game moment that just made you like you wanted to break shit or something like that.
2591806	2593126	Angry video game moment.
2593226	2595247	Alan, it looks like you're thinking of something.
2595689	2604318	Mike Tyson's punch out, the guy in the turban that span around and he had the little gem on his turban that sparkled when he was going to do his move.
2604358	2605299	Tiger something, yes.
2606120	2607421	Him, he brought me to tears.
2608382	2609563	Did you actually cry over a video?
2609583	2610965	I cried so much over that guy.
2614400	2615041	That's awesome.
2615081	2617283	I couldn't beat him and it just, I cried.
2617643	2626452	Would you actually do the whole like crying into your pillow thing where you like you throw the controller down and jump on your bed and go No, it was far more heart-wrenching.
2626973	2627253	Really?
2627494	2628274	Can you describe?
2628314	2630577	I was utterly defeated as a person.
2631798	2635362	My nine, ten year old self just had like these bitter tears of
2636818	2638018	Several people in chat, thank you.
2638058	2639299	GreatTiger was his name.
2640179	2641960	You've clearly tried to block that from your mind.
2642820	2643920	GreatTiger made you cry.
2644060	2644260	Yeah.
2646181	2649682	I want to make you a little t-shirt or something with this picture on it.
2649722	2650883	GreatTiger made me cry.
2651003	2651863	And here's the thing.
2651943	2657705	I actually got up to Mike Tyson in that game, and I never actually beat it because he was impossible.
2658085	2659986	But yet I was like, this is...
2661798	2665121	I was like, this is just stupid how hard this is.
2665901	2670625	So then I just stopped playing to Mike Tyson, but that one boss, I just cried.
2671727	2678110	I think I've thrown controllers, like power outages have made me throw controllers, which is very frustrating.
2678210	2682312	I can't think of any boss fights or anything that have really driven me to that, or cry.
2683633	2685233	I didn't get a drop in WoW the other day.
2685293	2686894	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2687534	2688295	I'm not that bad.
2689035	2690156	I'll do the Huffy stomp.
2690196	2690516	I'll do the...
2693237	2696678	Yeah, you roll like a 95 and then someone else... That happened.
2696698	2699239	That fucking shit happened to you last week.
2700359	2700800	I knew it.
2701060	2702540	And you were like, no, it's okay.
2702620	2703521	And like you typed a chat.
2703541	2705241	You're like, oh, it's okay.
2705281	2706262	Congratulations.
2706542	2707382	I'm glad you won it.
2707722	2710183	But I'm like, he's fucking sitting there fucking throwing a fit.
2710243	2712864	Like these probably like pillows are getting thrown in his place right now.
2712884	2713764	God damn it.
2715805	2717325	Why do we even fucking do these raves?
2717385	2718026	I don't know.
2718046	2720526	Hope that drop was worth it when I push you down the stairs next time I see you.
2723271	2728205	Anger Management, DarkSakura any moment in gaming where you've just gotten so angry you wanted to break something?
2728476	2733860	Playing Dan in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, I just wanted to take the controller and embed it firmly into his skull.
2734441	2738844	Because see, Dan, back in the day, and he's still like this to a degree, but not nearly as bad as he used to be.
2739685	2741327	Dan likes to gloat.
2742187	2745750	And likes to be alpha male, you know, big junk.
2745810	2746631	You don't say.
2747632	2749934	And back in the day, he had that problem even more.
2750914	2754697	And so he would kick my ass soundly until I would play Cammy and Gambit.
2755698	2759205	and he would just, ha ha, ha ha, you know, he was Nelson.
2759886	2763813	But he would be really dickly about it and finally I'm like, I'm just gonna beat you with this controller.
2764895	2766498	I beat Alan with my shoe last night.
2767290	2767970	How was it, Alan?
2769011	2769511	Was it hot?
2769651	2770932	Let me tell you about this in a minute, actually.
2771512	2772213	Because we have a call.
2772233	2774374	Seriously, who uses a shoe?
2775875	2776575	Caller, you're on the air.
2776635	2777155	Hi, who's this?
2778136	2779236	I have been derailed.
2779477	2781738	You guys just derailed me with the talk about their shoe.
2782038	2784819	This is the third time you've called in tonight, but that's okay.
2784859	2785340	What's on your mind?
2785400	2787941	Yeah, you must be tired of me calling all the damn time.
2788041	2788441	It's all right.
2788481	2788922	It's all good.
2788942	2789382	What's on your mind?
2790703	2796606	I have an interesting Xbox Live story, which in turn, I end up getting two months free service out of them.
2797266	2798246	Okay, how'd this work?
2799127	2802908	Well, I always buy the cards to reload my subscription.
2803448	2809211	It's a rarity that I actually log in with my credit card, give them my information to re-up me for a month or two.
2810051	2814833	Now, the last time this happened, they started automatically debiting my card, and I'm like, no, don't do that.
2815093	2817675	And I set it to make sure that it would not do that.
2818035	2818295	So...
2819734	2823257	I figured I'd go back to the cards and refill.
2824538	2828041	They had that $1 special, so I'm like, you know what?
2828721	2829722	I'm going to sign up for that.
2829822	2835486	So I signed up for about two months of service, and then I went out and got another card.
2835706	2840270	And I get an email from them saying that they were unable to bill my card because the card was invalid.
2840510	2843873	So I shrug it off like, no big deal.
2843953	2849057	You would think that they would see that in the system I automatically re-upped my account for another year.
2850794	2853477	Every two, three weeks I would get an email about that.
2854338	2860064	Then one week in July, I figured I'd jump on, buy or something on Netflix.
2860725	2864028	I go in and it says that my account is back to silver.
2864189	2866491	And I'm like, what the hell is going on?
2867312	2868253	I call them up.
2869162	2871864	asking them why did they cancel my account.
2871924	2875046	And they said, I did not pay for it.
2875366	2880950	And I'm explaining to them, if you see in the system, I purchased a one-year card.
2881471	2883292	So that makes no sense.
2883992	2890557	So here I am screaming at the poor guy in India who in turn is like, the best thing I can do is get you a supervisor.
2891338	2892498	I'm like, yeah, put him on.
2892919	2894400	I'm explaining the whole situation.
2894440	2896321	He's like, my hands are tied.
2896341	2897342	There's nothing I can do.
2897992	2903116	At that point, I just drop a nuclear bomb because I'm just beyond aggravated about all of this.
2904257	2908941	And he goes, well, what we can do, we can have a manager call you back within 48 hours.
2909682	2909922	Fine.
2910022	2910563	Here's my number.
2910863	2911984	Call me back in 48 hours.
2913185	2913405	Nope.
2913886	2914206	Nothing.
2914887	2915827	Absolutely nothing.
2916748	2918289	So I go online.
2918390	2921012	Wait, wait, wait.
2921092	2921953	I'm misunderstanding.
2921993	2922213	Okay.
2922533	2924495	They were set up to charge you automatically.
2925003	2926044	No, I canceled that.
2926284	2928385	Okay, you canceled that, but they tried to do it anyway.
2928966	2929206	Yes.
2929586	2931567	And then you used prepaid cards.
2932248	2932448	Yes.
2932528	2933309	And what were they doing?
2933349	2939693	Were they adding it to the time in the past that you hadn't paid for where you were like, I don't want to use this or I'm still lost right now?
2940613	2946517	What it was doing, the card was supposed to kick in after I paid for one month, which was in April.
2947038	2947298	Okay.
2947858	2951400	So my live was supposed to go from May 2010 to May, I guess, May 2011 or April 2011.
2951500	2951661	Okay.
2951681	2951761	Okay.
2954977	2955557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2974948	2980591	Manager never called me back, so I go on to the consumers, find contacts from Microsoft.
2980871	2985593	I sent an email to Steve Ballmer and somebody else in charge at Microsoft with Xbox Live.
2985974	2986274	Nice.
2987134	2989815	Within two days, I get a call from the manager.
2990416	2991836	I explain everything.
2992277	2995478	He profusely apologizes and goes into the system.
2995598	2999240	It seems that on the supervisor's end, they don't have access to billing.
3001536	3002357	That's crazy.
3002437	3003538	Like, what's the point then?
3004359	3006761	You'd think there ought to be somebody that can fix it, you know?
3006801	3007402	It's just weird.
3008623	3009524	Yeah, very.
3009764	3013187	I'm like, I'm yelling at the guy, log into your system and fix it.
3013267	3014468	Oh, we don't have access to that.
3014829	3016730	How do you not have access to, you know?
3017831	3023437	Goldanthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelandry.com says, it's because of shit like this that I'm just going to stick to prepaid cards now.
3025097	3030521	I don't blame him, but you know, damn it, a dollar for a month is a good deal and you can't beat that.
3030681	3032923	That is a very good deal.
3033583	3035624	Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to say real quick?
3035645	3039107	Because we're going to get back to Angry Games and beating with shoes and stuff in a minute.
3039988	3049594	Long story short, the guy contacts me back, he cancelled my gold, sends me a new code, so now I'm good from July to like June of 2011.
3050055	3051896	So I end up getting like two extra months out of the deal.
3052296	3052997	Must be nice.
3053942	3054302	Yeah.
3054382	3058426	So in the moral of the story is yelling at the supervisor fixes the trick every time.
3059687	3060188	I'm kidding.
3060228	3060628	I'm kidding.
3060949	3062030	I used to work in a call center.
3062070	3063231	Please don't.
3063311	3063992	I know.
3064232	3065073	Don't yell at them.
3065193	3067094	If they can't help you, find me.
3067134	3069797	I'll give you an email address of somebody that will take care of it for you.
3069817	3070598	Yeah, exactly.
3071819	3072119	All right.
3072480	3074181	All right, Ranma, I'm going to let you go for real.
3074221	3075022	Have a good one, okay, buddy?
3075663	3076063	Okay, good.
3076083	3076804	I need more vodka.
3077064	3077604	All right, good luck.
3077644	3077905	Have fun.
3079079	3080559	Alright, where were we?
3080639	3081860	Oh yes, Beating with Shoes.
3081960	3083680	And Alan's like, I want to tell this story.
3085161	3087881	Yeah, so Rob does not parallel park.
3088582	3089102	He doesn't.
3090302	3095183	In San Francisco, near where I live, parking is more precious than platinum or gold.
3095884	3101405	So if you see a space, especially if it's a rock star space right in front of where you're going, you park in it.
3102225	3108127	But, you know, if you're used to parking lots and you can't parallel park, you just say fuck that and you keep going.
3108847	3116813	So whenever Rob under extreme duress has to parallel park, I will basically tease the hell out of him for it because he usually will not try.
3117714	3125200	And last night when we were going to his Rocky Horror performance, there were basically three blocks of parallel parking without cars.
3125420	3128362	So he just had to like drive in and sort of scoot his car up to the edge.
3129223	3130264	And I was like, I don't know.
3130564	3131605	Are you sure you can handle it?
3131925	3132886	It's parallel parking.
3132966	3136149	So he takes his shoe off and starts whapping me with it.
3137009	3140552	No, no, it was, I said, you better be quieter, I'm gonna beat you in my shoe.
3141113	3144515	And then I think I, like, hit the curb with parking.
3144555	3149580	Yeah, see, and that's the thing, then finally he stops the car and he's like, oh wait, how far away from the curb am I?
3150140	3152322	And I'm like, there's no one here.
3152722	3157646	Like, my original making fun of you still stands, and then he took his shoe off and he hit me with it.
3158887	3159688	Well, you deserved it.
3160249	3160989	Yeah.
3161029	3163151	I'm not one to advocate domestic violence, but, you know.
3165174	3171556	So yeah, he gives me stink eye for making fun of his parallel parking and then he stops the car and we're like five feet away from the curb.
3172556	3173256	With no cars.
3173276	3174737	He didn't have to wiggle wiggle in at all.
3174877	3175657	Nope, not at all.
3176037	3176237	Yeah.
3176737	3177177	Good times.
3177918	3179798	Yeah, I agree with Brakeman in our chat room.
3179878	3180998	Fuck parallel parking.
3181058	3181799	I agree with that.
3182879	3184419	And Misty says, fuck driving.
3184519	3185740	That's your attitude, right?
3185760	3187420	Yeah, that's where I'm at.
3187480	3190261	What is it about driving that you're just not going to do it?
3192114	3196636	The expense in, you know, car payment, gas insurance.
3198136	3199897	Someone gets drunk and hits you, you're dead.
3200917	3202558	You know, it's just, it's awful.
3203358	3207559	But it's really nice, like, being able to go wherever you want, whenever you want.
3207599	3209800	Like, that's really, you don't have to rely on really anyone else.
3211104	3211524	Just saying.
3212885	3214126	I have the internet at home.
3214186	3215487	I don't have to go anywhere.
3216428	3216828	What about food?
3216868	3218109	Amazon will ship it to my house.
3218169	3222952	What about if it's like, oh my god, I need some pink berry right now or I'm going to kill somebody.
3223012	3223513	I went there.
3224373	3224653	I heard.
3224673	3225094	And they played ABBA.
3225114	3226134	How was it?
3226194	3226615	It was awesome.
3227255	3228096	Isn't it amazing?
3228596	3228896	So good.
3228936	3234620	I had the chocolate with the hazelnut crunch stuff on it and I wanted to die.
3234760	3235281	It was good.
3235841	3236742	I've been telling you.
3236962	3237382	It's amazing.
3237402	3238583	And I love the way that place is designed.
3238936	3239296	It's cute.
3239837	3240537	Very cute little place.
3240557	3241298	Sorry, it's a derail.
3242138	3243459	No, it's okay.
3243519	3248282	Misty in chat says, it's a combo of the expense, the idiots on the road, and my failed attention span.
3249403	3251004	Long drives can be tough.
3251044	3253646	Sometimes I'm like, oh, I want to take a really long drive.
3253746	3263953	I'm going to go drive across country, or I'll drive, I'll do something crazy like go drive to Kansas and visit Shane because it's halfway across the country, or I'll drive up to Canada, like Vancouver or something.
3264313	3265794	And then I'm like, oh, God.
3266815	3267095	DarkSakura.com
3296969	3298892	We drove to Poster, Washington.
3298912	3299893	It's pretty much just as far.
3299973	3303298	I think last year we did.
3303498	3304359	Drive up there is great.
3304399	3305281	Well, Dan drove.
3305481	3306002	I slept.
3307123	3308805	He would stop me on the way back for snow.
3310307	3310687	Yeah, yeah.
3341457	3342798	I love that that's your response.
3343998	3345899	Yeah, that was me.
3357503	3358324	Thanks for watching!
3374998	3378760	I know one of them has, the shoulder button has like a magnet in it.
3378880	3381301	If you hit it wrong, it'll detach the magnet.
3381882	3384483	And you can't, if you, because it works with a magnet somehow.
3385503	3388105	And so if it's not attached in the right place, it won't work.
3388805	3389645	So that, for that.
3389745	3397309	And I know the last week when I was playing Burnout Revenge, any time I was like screwing up a bunch, I would get a screaming going.
3398590	3400651	Just go, oh, fuck you, god damn it.
3400971	3410897	It's so funny how Nintendo, like, puts out this, like, very family-friendly system, you know, and it's like, oh, you know, oh, we have to use friend codes so that children don't hear naughty language and da-da-da.
3410917	3417942	But I remember back in the day in college playing Super Mario Kart in the dorms, and we would say the filthiest shit while playing that game.
3418022	3427628	Like, you know, talking about each other, our mothers, you know, sex stuff, and just all this stuff while playing, you know, Mario Kart.
3427728	3428248	It got ugly.
3428588	3429088	Very ugly.
3430169	3432751	But it's not my fault I whoop them all with Toad because he's the best.
3432971	3433191	Yes.
3436653	3437853	Those are cars you will drive.
3438294	3439074	Go-karts, right?
3440835	3441996	Would you drive like a real go-kart?
3443016	3443857	I'm 6'5".
3443917	3444837	Could I fit in one?
3445998	3448019	When we go to Disneyland, will you ride Autotopia?
3449040	3449300	Sure.
3451391	3456813	Oh my god, then I could take a picture of you driving and be all like, hell froze over, lol.
3458794	3460634	You're like, this isn't funny, I want to change the topic.
3463835	3467997	Let's see, Breakman in chat says, long drives are fine as long as your wife or girlfriend sleeps.
3469818	3470178	Lol.
3470958	3473999	Well, my girlfriend just keeps telling me how bad of a driver I am.
3474079	3475359	Bitch, I know I'm a bad driver.
3475439	3476680	Close your eyes, you won't notice.
3480051	3480291	Nice.
3481032	3481952	Oh, hey, the phone's ringing.
3481972	3482573	Why don't we answer it?
3483554	3484554	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3484574	3484935	Who's this?
3486696	3487557	It's Aseo again.
3487777	3489118	Hey, what's on your mind, Aseo?
3491359	3494562	Actually, I was hoping to talk about Infamous 2.
3496063	3496763	Well, okay.
3497224	3497584	What's up?
3497744	3498665	What do you think of Infamous 2?
3499125	3501887	Tell us a little bit about it for those that don't know what Infamous is all about.
3504249	3508192	Well, I haven't actually played the game, so I don't really know a whole lot about the story, but...
3509636	3536408	apparently some world ending thing or whatever disaster strikes and here appears by the name of Cole and he has electrical powers now what I want to talk about the second one is how are they going to integrate the ice abilities into the gameplay mechanics because from what I played on the
3541871	3550274	What I played on the demo for the first one, everything just kind of melded together for the electrical abilities, so I'm just wondering how that would work.
3550614	3553415	Unfortunately, it's not a series I'm on the up and up on.
3553475	3557936	Loki's kind of the expert about those, and he's not here, so I don't know.
3558416	3562497	Is Infamous a series you've read up on at all, Alan, Jamie, anybody?
3562797	3563577	I don't know much about this.
3563718	3564898	I bought it, but I haven't played it.
3565098	3565438	Oh, really?
3565998	3567339	At least somebody has used it.
3567359	3567779	What series?
3568219	3568639	Infamous.
3569612	3571373	Oh, um, no.
3573695	3575836	We're so informed here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3575856	3576497	That's awesome.
3576517	3577797	Well, we don't have time to play everything.
3577817	3578238	I'm sorry.
3579759	3583601	We can't play anything right now because Dan's playing the game that shan't be named.
3583721	3583881	I know.
3583901	3584822	They've been playing that all night.
3584842	3585782	I was thinking about playing Sims.
3585962	3590065	As long as we have been doing this marathon, they have been playing the game we can't name.
3590225	3590425	What?
3590445	3593387	Once again, it shall not be named.
3594212	3594472	Name it.
3594492	3594732	It's violent.
3594752	3595493	Is there a reason why?
3595533	3596874	Because it's not out yet.
3596894	3596934	Oh.
3596954	3598075	He's playing Imagine Single Lady.
3598095	3598175	Yes.
3622236	3623677	I didn't tell you what we were playing.
3623697	3624238	I don't know nothing.
3650220	3651441	I don't know nothing, you savages.
3652021	3652761	It's been about an hour.
3652781	3653842	You guys want to take a quick break here?
3654142	3654642	Take a stretch?
3654702	3655423	I want to get more water.
3655703	3657624	We're going to take a potty stretch break.
3657684	3658084	Come back.
3658684	3660225	We got some more topics we got through Facebook.
3660285	3662246	Twitter topics galore we still have to do.
3662526	3663747	Rob, you have to do the theme.
3664207	3664607	What theme?
3665373	3667774	The Pala Pala Parapara thing.
3667794	3669114	Oh, I didn't have time to set it up.
3669154	3669514	I'm sorry.
3669754	3670274	I forgot.
3671335	3672955	I've just put everything on shuffle.
3673055	3675416	So maybe you'll get the... I know you like this song.
3675436	3676936	We'll do this song.
3676956	3677336	Okay.
3677356	3677756	You'll like this.
3678236	3682778	And so we'll be back with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon as we enter into hour eight in just a moment.
3682818	3688039	We'll be back with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon, your tweets, so forth and so on.
3694443	3695104	Orange Lounge Radio
3707779	3708820	of our marathon.
3709200	3710841	We started at two and it's now ten.
3712302	3712762	Can't believe it.
3713043	3718887	Alright, and it probably doesn't turn out that long on the podcast because we have been taking musical breaks, which some people might consider cheating, but you know what?
3719787	3721388	We gotta go to the bathroom at some point.
3721428	3722089	We gotta eat.
3722129	3723890	We gotta, you know, just get up and stretch.
3723910	3725811	This room gets kind of stuffy too, so, you know.
3726772	3727652	That's just how it works.
3727672	3729073	If you don't like it, too bad.
3729294	3730674	The show's free, for God's sake.
3730935	3732436	Stop complaining about free things.
3732956	3733416	You suck.
3733556	3733736	Alright.
3733756	3733977	Alright.
3736178	3743383	I should say though, if you want to support free things, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or tell a couple people about the show.
3743503	3744444	That's what we always ask.
3744484	3746585	Just tell some friends and all that good stuff.
3746606	3747126	That's all we want.
3748207	3748467	All right.
3749468	3751109	Chat's asking about chat FUs.
3751149	3752229	Can we do some chat FUs?
3752290	3753430	Are we going to read some of those?
3753450	3754171	Sure.
3754311	3756693	Go ahead and send them and I'll read them in about 30 minutes.
3756733	3757033	Sound good?
3757369	3758711	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3773243	3785967	Meanwhile, Twitter, we never got around to doing the tweets that were sent us in the last segment because I asked for some tweets and we got on tangents talking about Angry Games and the callers that we had and all that good stuff.
3786007	3790009	So I'm going to try to get to some tweets.
3790369	3791369	But I don't have the Twitter music.
3792670	3794070	I can't do tweets without the Twitter music.
3796971	3797451	Oh my gosh.
3797972	3799032	I ruined everything.
3799272	3800232	We have to stop the marathon.
3800272	3800592	It's done.
3800733	3801453	No!
3803496	3804177	I'm kidding.
3804197	3808160	When you were out getting pizza, I deleted all of the native OLR music files.
3808520	3808961	They're gone.
3809261	3809982	You jerk.
3811383	3811943	Alright, I found it.
3823271	3830652	We love our Twitter, O-L-R-E-D To KRA saying, how is the Final Fantasy XIV beta?
3830773	3832593	Isn't it just a prettier FFXI?
3833333	3834273	Yeah, pretty much.
3834573	3838914	It's FFXI with different combat and this whole guild leps thing that makes no sense to me whatsoever.
3839594	3842795	The biggest problem with Final Fantasy XI is that it doesn't handhold you at all.
3842875	3845956	And like, I agree, some games overdo it with the handholding.
3846356	3848656	But what was the most frustrating thing about Final Fantasy XI?
3848676	3851977	The fact that it just plunks you in the middle of a town and was like, okay, bye.
3851997	3852417	The people.
3852437	3852817	The people.
3853675	3855357	Yeah.
3855877	3858940	So Final Fantasy XIV, the beta is really crowded.
3859681	3860802	I couldn't figure out what to do.
3861342	3866627	I couldn't figure out that there was a whole other map level I was supposed to go to and activate a switch.
3867227	3875175	You would think the game would lead you through the first couple quests just to kind of give you a tutorial about how the game works, the interface, you know?
3875695	3901206	maybe it's because it's a beta not all of that's built in yet but I just the beta left me feeling very frustrated and that's why I'm kind of laughing at all this like closed betas or the open beta stuff going on is I'm like guys it's not worth your time okay but hey it's a free game and at least you'll know if you can uh buy it when it comes out or not but I honestly think the game is going to tank I think it's going to tank bad especially for a Final Fantasy game like I think they're expecting it to do really well it's not going to do nearly the business 13 did
3903965	3904485	But we'll see.
3907767	3909548	DJ Blaziken sent us several tweets.
3909728	3912330	Usually I limit people to two tweets, but hey, it's the marathon.
3912370	3912670	Why not?
3913110	3916972	So DJ Blaziken says, What's cuter than a cat playing Duck Hunt?
3917753	3918633	Nothing!
3918713	3922555	And sends us this tweet, or sorry, article via Twitter.
3922575	3923656	And I actually did see this.
3924116	3927438	It's a video on YouTube of a kitty who's actually playing Duck Hunt.
3928438	3929459	And they start the game there.
3932065	3934006	And then the kid, this is terrible radio, but I don't care.
3934386	3936567	And the cat, see the cat's like scratching the dog with her paws.
3940028	3942028	Like attacking the ducks even though they fly off screen.
3942088	3942849	It's adorable.
3945389	3946170	Tell me that's not adorable.
3947090	3947530	It's adorable.
3948551	3952032	Cats are so damn cute.
3952112	3952452	Let's see.
3953598	3956380	DJ Blaziken says, don't bother watching football this season.
3956420	3957880	Madden 11 already picked all the winners.
3958681	3966125	And linked us to a news story about how I guess all the winners are already, it's been determined because, you know, there's all the statistics in Madden and everything.
3967506	3969847	The Ravens and Packers will be the conference winners.
3970527	3971088	So there it is.
3971408	3973549	So I just, I, LOL Super Bowl spoilers.
3975285	3980007	I think the football star that actually is on the cover of Madden has the Madden curse.
3980567	3988009	So like if you're the guy who's on the box art, they have a horrible season after the game comes out.
3988430	3989670	I think that's like a thing.
3989950	3990230	I don't know.
3990430	3991611	I don't follow the ball.
3991631	3991731	It is.
3991771	3992571	I've heard the same thing.
3992851	3994872	They always get injured or something happens.
3996232	3997173	Who was on the cover this year?
3997473	3998213	I wasn't paying attention.
4000310	4001211	Was it Brett Favre?
4001391	4002071	People like him.
4002632	4003312	Tiger Woods.
4005774	4006395	David Beckham.
4007075	4008056	That's football, right?
4008076	4008596	Yes, that's right.
4008616	4009257	It's David Beckham.
4009637	4009917	It is.
4011218	4011598	All right.
4013840	4014380	Let's see.
4014520	4017923	DJ Blaze can send us a story that we talked about in the very first hour of the marathon.
4017943	4021386	So I'm just going to assume you didn't hear it about Microsoft raising the price of Xbox Live Gold.
4021786	4023247	We'll just pretend that I didn't get that tweet.
4025170	4028631	Apparently Super Scribblenauts is there.
4029271	4032272	There's an announcement about Super Scribblenauts or whatever.
4032632	4032972	I don't know.
4032992	4036293	Red Entertainment is linking us to this story on Twitter at Mega64.
4036373	4041095	I guess they're excited because they're in the game.
4046756	4048397	They're actually in the game, I guess.
4050911	4051491	Good for them.
4053593	4054313	Whoopty shit.
4054533	4055193	I mean, whatever.
4076565	4077546	Do you know who I am?
4078687	4081169	No, I don't expect people to know who I am.
4082070	4083731	But yay to them getting in a game, I guess.
4083851	4086874	I guess now I won't be able to get away from it.
4086974	4087855	I'll have to know who they are.
4089676	4094778	It was... I don't know if I should say this because this is getting back to... I won't go into it any further.
4094958	4095438	Allegedly.
4096139	4096399	All right.
4096659	4098440	The word allegedly will always say it over and over again.
4098460	4098920	Oh, come on.
4098940	4099900	This is an alleged story.
4100400	4101081	It's all allegedly.
4101921	4104182	Allegedly, it was a large man with glasses.
4104282	4105082	That's all I'm going to say.
4105162	4105443	All right.
4106883	4108404	But I think that's all of them, isn't it?
4109124	4112586	I think in that video they were all large men with glasses, weren't they?
4114407	4115668	I don't think that tells you anything.
4115688	4118210	Yeah, large men in IT and software development.
4118290	4119511	Yeah, I know, I know.
4119611	4120612	It's like a unicorn.
4121392	4121673	All right.
4122173	4123414	But yay for Super Scribblenauts.
4123454	4124075	I think that's great.
4125396	4128498	Sony is going to be rolling out Arrival to iTunes, apparently.
4128518	4130320	Didn't Loki bring this up earlier in the show?
4130960	4131441	I think he did.
4133561	4134101	Shout out!
4134121	4134182	Woo!
4151570	4154231	Alright, let's see, moving on.
4154311	4160473	DarkTetsuya says, I know this is a more local question, but will the Golfland slash Dave and Buster meetup still happen sometime soon?
4161853	4162694	They've been happening.
4163994	4166195	Yeah, well there wasn't one this past week.
4166455	4169776	Well no, because Dan and I were saving money and time for our anniversary.
4170676	4171917	But they've been happening.
4173577	4174798	History will repeat itself.
4175918	4176318	That's it.
4177078	4178239	Yes, it'll happen again, of course.
4180062	4180803	Um, let's see.
4182164	4186427	Uh, Jeju Go on chat says, uh, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
4186527	4188409	Possible, impromptu, listless?
4189009	4189529	Question mark.
4189770	4189990	Huh.
4190130	4192852	We do need to do a listless at some point before the marathon's over.
4193092	4195033	How about during the next break we write up stuff?
4195253	4199417	Yeah, we'll write that in a match game during the next break and then we'll have something to play for real, so that'll be cool.
4200597	4204438	Let's see, Amay Satsuma says, what kind of pre-order bonus do you want to see in Duke Nukem Forever?
4205119	4207419	I want to see a Duke Nukem Forever urinal cake.
4207699	4209840	I think that would be quite classy.
4209860	4211100	Don't you think that would be very classy?
4211941	4212981	I know, I think it's classy.
4214341	4217582	Anybody here in the studio, what kind of pre-order bonus do you want to see for Duke Nukem Forever?
4217882	4220823	How about Duke Nukem Forever pasties for your stripper friends?
4220903	4221664	That would be good, right?
4223424	4223744	Anybody?
4224344	4225265	I want the stripper pole.
4225745	4226665	You want the stripper pole?
4227345	4228546	I want the pole and a gun.
4229066	4229226	Huh?
4230566	4231346	Alan, anything?
4231827	4232307	I don't know.
4235569	4235849	Nice.
4236569	4237830	Alright, let's see.
4237870	4239291	Other tweets at OLR.
4239651	4243513	Breakman says on Twitter, What are the OLR drinking games?
4243613	4244393	What are the rules?
4244493	4245854	Can the chatters play together?
4245994	4247095	I use any excuse.
4247575	4249616	Yeah, drink anytime one of us says um.
4250156	4252798	You'll be floored in like a minute.
4253610	4255072	No, uh, oopsie drink.
4257114	4264342	I think there is a drinking game compiled on the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wikia.com.
4264483	4267166	I want to say there is a drinking game compiled there.
4268547	4272632	And it combines some stuff with Under Sedation Live, if you listen to that show.
4272752	4273373	Although, I don't know.
4274774	4302134	I'm looking at Twitter and there's a tweet from Travis earlier six hours ago so that was during the main show actually heard something on OLR that made me angry and dislike the show and that is something that never happened before okay he's so theatrical I love Travis but just say what it is or I mean I don't know what else to say sorry Travis sorry we ruffled your feathers alright anyhow
4303755	4304475	That's it for Twitter.
4304515	4307096	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.
4308456	4309056	That would be fun.
4311097	4311537	Now what?
4311737	4312537	What are we talking about now?
4312957	4313497	Oh, chat FUs.
4313518	4314278	Do we have chat FUs?
4315038	4315458	Just about.
4315578	4316698	Sufficient chat angst?
4317438	4318399	What do you mean just about?
4319059	4319939	Either you do or you don't.
4320059	4320519	You do.
4320819	4321239	All right, good.
4321700	4326961	All right, let's get to the angsty music and we'll do some chat FUs right now.
4340526	4341948	First one comes from Toygak.
4342608	4344010	F you to being East Coast.
4344130	4344450	P.S.
4344530	4346112	Thanks for the amazing show.
4346813	4346953	Aww.
4348014	4349936	Ranma, massive F you to Pepsi cult.
4350016	4350297	What?
4350937	4354481	Stop Drinkle holding Pepsi throwback even though it's in limited edition.
4354861	4355702	It's still hard to find.
4355823	4359446	Add to snatch the last 12 pack of throwback out of someone's cart.
4359567	4360528	Step it up, Pepsi.
4361388	4362690	Dude, it's everywhere here, really.
4364659	4368322	Weiland, F you to this ear infection and the hearing loss that's gone with it.
4368742	4370003	Owen, F you to that one guy.
4370724	4373286	The one guy that did that stuff back then at that place.
4374867	4378650	DarkTetia, fuck having to wake up early to fly home tomorrow.
4379531	4379991	Poor baby.
4381092	4382593	Breakman, my F you.
4382854	4384855	F you to five day work weeks.
4385656	4386857	F you to faux holidays.
4388238	4389239	Okay.
4390279	4391941	You know in some places they work six days a week.
4393334	4407013	DarkCircuitry, F you to annoying little fucking kids who jump up on the 2P pad while you're playing a particularly difficult doubles chart in, insert dance game of choice here, thereby either ruining your score, distracting you, or causing you to fail out entirely, or fall out entirely.
4410560	4412741	DDR Dollar, FU on two parts.
4413162	4415583	One for someone on IRC who actually has my name.
4416024	4417965	I'm the fucking original, damn it.
4418946	4425750	And two for the Call of Duty Black Ops developers who are trying to get people like me to play more multiplayer.
4425930	4426530	Fuck that.
4427991	4430333	Final Fantasy VII, FU to the bad effects.
4432194	4435396	Hours later from eating extremely hot slash spicy food.
4435797	4437758	Feeling like you're giving birth to lava blows.
4439986	4440306	You know what?
4440366	4441066	Eat more crackers.
4441346	4441746	They'll help.
4443087	4444447	Ray Goldrush.
4445067	4448828	F you to this Japanese textbook for being confusing and hard to learn vocabulary and kanji in.
4451909	4452709	Kawaisone.
4454770	4455530	Alpha Kananagram.
4455790	4458631	F you to me having to wait for next Tuesday for 360.
4458671	4459271	Poor baby.
4460571	4460951	Poor baby.
4465854	4468296	I'm officially out of topics.
4485100	4486582	What is your favorite video game of all time?
4506934	4507634	Well said TGL, bitches
4535286	4539088	Guardian Legend Bradley, what is your favorite video game of all time?
4544451	4554117	It's hard for me to decide Go on It's too hard I love them all so much Alan?
4554917	4555638	You want to try this one?
4557238	4558099	Valkyrie Profile
4559501	4588455	and Ty Maniac you can't pick two you're a cheater no okay fine you pick two Maniac Mansion okay why Valkyrie Profile because your mom I don't know don't give me that look like I don't need a reason bitch like there's gotta be something about the game that you like right the art the music the story the unmatched combat no RPG has ever really done what was the combat in Valkyrie Profile for those that don't know
4590666	4603427	it was a weird hybrid of active time battle and real time it had really insane combos in it like Street Fighter why Maniac Mansion?
4604724	4605965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4625680	4627240	I barely remember that.
4627821	4628921	I think you're right, though.
4629261	4630901	I'm almost positive there was.
4633222	4634703	Did you actually play that through to completion?
4635043	4639924	Is it true you can beat it with every combination of characters, or no, you can't do it with all of them?
4640524	4651907	There are... I know that there are two or three characters that it's really preferred that you have at least one of them in there, but yeah, I think you can beat it with all, with any three.
4652407	4653348	Wait, here you go, here you go.
4653408	4654368	Look at this, Blast in the Past.
4656833	4660974	This is a live-action movie.
4661074	4664435	Yeah, it was a live-action show.
4664475	4664855	A TV show.
4664956	4666536	Oh my gosh, I remember that.
4666756	4670537	It was almost like a drama, the way the credits make it look like, huh?
4670577	4670897	Yeah.
4682202	4685365	Let's see, let me see if I can go... Oh, it was created by Eugene Levy, really?
4686145	4690469	Let's see, wait, there's a... I think it ran for like three episodes before they pulled the plug on it.
4693132	4696354	This is like a scene out of Twin Peaks or something.
4707455	4708176	This is creepy.
4708336	4708937	I don't like this.
4709137	4709438	Alright.
4710199	4711000	Yeah, this is upsetting.
4711220	4712041	It's upsetting me.
4712262	4713543	Is it ruining your memory of the show?
4713563	4715967	Or is it ruining your memory of the game?
4716728	4718050	Is it making you like the game a little less?
4718070	4720573	Well, it has nothing to do with the game, so... Alright.
4721074	4724018	But it said in the credits, based on the Lucasfilm game, just so you know.
4728257	4728978	Hey, save it for when you get home
4744534	4746055	It was even mentioned during this show.
4746175	4746495	It was.
4746515	4748616	Because Bob grabbed my copy and goes, Look!
4749637	4750217	It's great.
4750477	4750957	I love it.
4751157	4755039	And yet I haven't bought Metroid Other M because I'm afraid it's terrible.
4755239	4757580	I've heard from people it's great.
4757620	4759962	I've been hearing mixed things on it and I'm very worried.
4760122	4761902	And I have to hook up my Wii to play it.
4761942	4763543	I don't want to hook up the Wii.
4763903	4764664	Solution.
4765124	4765484	Netflix.
4766805	4766965	What?
4768132	4769133	or Gamefly or whatever.
4769213	4770874	Oh, I was like, Netflix?
4771094	4772315	You can get games through Netflix too.
4772516	4781943	Yeah, I could do the Netfly, the Gamefly thing, but that would involve me again getting the motivation to hook up the Wii to my TV and that means, you know.
4782283	4784485	Rob, it takes 10 freaking minutes.
4785145	4785846	Not in my house.
4785966	4789949	You've had a Gamefly account since like March that's been rotting since March.
4790009	4791070	I don't really ever use it.
4791130	4791751	It's kind of sad.
4793112	4793452	I don't know.
4793492	4794032	Is it worth it?
4794052	4797155	Should I play Metroid Other M if I'm such a stan for Super Metroid?
4797526	4798567	Chat, vote, why in?
4801690	4802090	Let's see.
4802551	4806174	Breakman says watch FNG Friday Night Gaming or F-ing Live.
4806234	4807295	It's F-ing Live.
4807996	4811119	Bobby's going to show Metroid Other M. Maybe I'll check that out.
4811139	4811439	We'll see.
4812040	4813561	I might.
4815543	4815883	We'll see.
4816984	4818045	Bradley, time's up.
4818065	4818705	Did you think of something?
4819086	4822028	I think I'd probably go with Panzer Dragoon Saga.
4822268	4824349	It's a really epic game.
4824769	4829853	It's the one game when the first time I saw the battle system, I got, whoa, that's awesome.
4830253	4843842	Just because it's such a different system and seeing that you're flying right next to the enemies that you're fighting, it's like, oh, this is really, really, really neat because you're flying around them in a circle and then you attack based on that.
4845996	4873011	and then just a really cool storyline and lots of things to explore and neat things never played it sadly I think I've played all the other games that have been mentioned but I've never played that for some sick reason I'm just not cool yeah well it was only a limited edition and all that kind of stuff it's definitely worth a play I want to say that only 6,000 copies were printed in the US when it came out wow no wonder it's so expensive
4873891	4878374	Let's see some folks in chat about Metroid Other M. Yes, yes, yes, why, why?
4879034	4880875	But then I got a private message that says it sucks.
4881136	4884298	So maybe the people who think it sucks don't want to speak up.
4884698	4885919	Frisbee says at least try it.
4886019	4887480	Oh, there's Miklatov saying no.
4889201	4890241	Hey, we got last minute FU.
4890642	4893323	Ranma says someone get Sky some caffeine stat.
4894464	4897266	And Breakman says fuck caffeine, get him some more booze and a cot.
4899207	4900027	Is there caffeine in that?
4900327	4901048	It's real dark Pepsi.
4901068	4902008	You can finish it.
4902508	4903808	I got the last one so you can have it.
4903828	4905509	Alright, what'd you have for you?
4905829	4909590	From Marissa, F you to not seeing Rob and Jamie, heart, heart, heart, need to visit.
4910431	4910911	From Marissa.
4911071	4911871	Tell her about Tron.
4912231	4913011	She wasn't listening earlier.
4913031	4913391	You can have it.
4914132	4914972	You're giving it to me?
4915092	4915492	I am.
4915532	4916352	You're a nice lady.
4916472	4916893	I know.
4916933	4917373	Thank you.
4917613	4919193	I'm gonna have more beer.
4919653	4920494	Did you want some Pepsi?
4921374	4922474	Good, because I wasn't gonna give it to you.
4922734	4924215	Alright.
4924855	4927696	Yeah, we're planning on going to see Tron at Disneyland.
4929628	4930829	But then your mic cut out.
4931329	4934392	Hint, hint, hint to people who work at Disneyland, let us in.
4935012	4945680	But no, we're planning on going to see Tron and go to the big Tron party and then go have ourselves digitized so we can live in Tron world and then go play the Tron level in Kingdom Hearts 2.
4946541	4949343	And then, then we might find a life.
4949363	4950023	Play that music.
4950383	4950924	What music?
4951344	4955927	Didn't I give you the Tron music from... Oh, because I have it just right here sitting in front of me.
4956828	4957849	Fine, I'm going to email it to you.
4959992	4960953	I just happen to have it.
4961053	4961333	Oh, yeah.
4961613	4962353	Right here, Jamie.
4962393	4963194	It's on the desktop.
4963234	4967696	I have it saved just for circumstances like this when Jamie's going to shout randomly.
4968016	4968396	Rob!
4969617	4971017	Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.
4971718	4976100	Don't you have that freaking... Whatever.
4976400	4977040	I just don't want this.
4977060	4980862	You're almost nine hours into the broadcast and tensions are finally... That's right.
4980942	4982042	Tensions are finally flaring.
4982803	4984243	I will vote you off this island.
4984663	4986824	I will shove that Vuvuzela so far up your ass.
4987885	4988165	All right.
4990106	4990766	Ah, stop!
4991527	4991947	Stop!
4993268	4993608	Fucker.
4994388	4994628	There.
4995749	4997930	I just got a text message from my friend Nathan.
4998290	5002452	Maybe it was a mistake to post about this on Facebook, because I think some of my real-life friends suddenly tune in.
5002492	5003473	I post on my Facebook.
5003833	5005534	I'm on hour eight of my radio show.
5005614	5006094	Please help.
5006494	5013458	No, but Nathan sent me a text saying, if you run out of stuff to talk about, there is always the D&D campaign I ran with you as the sassy black lady.
5017160	5018060	What's so funny?
5018760	5019461	We had fun.
5020915	5023556	I can just imagine you playing the sassy black lady.
5024417	5025897	Why is that?
5027378	5032960	You know, because I've heard you do impressions of people and I could totally see you doing the sassy black lady.
5033540	5036021	You did pull off a good Jewish mother once.
5037222	5037782	Yes, I know.
5038642	5039523	It was funny.
5039943	5043144	Rob, why aren't you picking up your phone?
5043544	5044885	You need to call your mother.
5045585	5045825	See?
5047166	5047926	He does it really well.
5049564	5057948	Did you cast like, oh hell no, and it has like a one day cooldown where you use it on like an orc and you couldn't cast it again for another day?
5059809	5060169	Sorry.
5060929	5061910	Yeah, something like that.
5062570	5070874	Well, you know, no, it's just like, you know, all these freaking elves and dwarf people up in here, like, you know, we need some, we need to represent.
5072735	5073415	So, good times.
5074813	5075173	Let's see.
5075273	5078094	Silent Nathan says he was the best noob player I've ever had.
5078174	5078795	I was awesome.
5078835	5080175	Okay, this is the time.
5080415	5081836	I've told you about the ex, right?
5081976	5083817	The one that just ruined everything.
5085597	5087458	Like, no matter where you take him, he'd ruin it.
5087918	5093881	Well, for some reason, I invited him to play D&D with us, and he was also a noob at this whole thing, and man, he just ruined it.
5094001	5099243	Like, you know, he'd be like, you know, you know, oh, I want to cast a spell.
5099323	5100063	Oh, it's in the book.
5100123	5101624	I want to cast a spell in the book.
5103145	5103205	Um...
5106072	5106693	He's like that.
5107093	5108355	I want to show my titties.
5108735	5110397	How do I show my titties?
5110537	5115303	I'm not lying.
5115463	5116224	I'm not lying.
5116284	5117606	He was like that, allegedly.
5118006	5118607	He was like this.
5119247	5120929	Okay, Rob, I'm sending you something.
5121870	5123833	And you need to read the email on the air.
5124654	5125074	Why?
5125555	5126376	I just sent it to you.
5127354	5128194	to my personal email?
5128234	5128755	Yes.
5129655	5131156	I want to roll a cleric, okay?
5131616	5132176	What's its name?
5132216	5134137	He was a cleric!
5134277	5138739	He was a priest in WoW, so he wanted to be a priest in whatever.
5138819	5140419	Pull up the Satan's Game.
5141820	5142580	Satan's Game?
5142660	5144621	On YouTube.
5145341	5146702	Dungeons and Dragons.
5147402	5148582	Satan's Game.
5150583	5153724	Because you brought that up and it'll give us time for you to check your email.
5154184	5155485	I've got like a million things I'm trying to do.
5157004	5158205	Maybe you don't.
5158325	5158565	Maybe 100,000.
5158605	5163869	I told Nathan to call in and talk about D&D, but he doesn't want to.
5164009	5164210	Do it!
5166552	5167192	Satan's Game?
5167352	5170375	Yeah.
5170615	5171836	Should be Dungeons & Dragons.
5172096	5173397	Dungeons & Dragons, Satan's Game.
5174418	5175139	Yeah, there you go.
5175659	5176199	Okay.
5176220	5181264	I don't think that's it.
5183664	5187470	Like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years Dungeons and Dragons
5195615	5196815	Satan's Game.
5197676	5213519	Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.
5214100	5220521	This afternoon, the Dead Alewives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.
5221161	5223782	Observe the previously unobservable
5224102	5225043	What's with the extra music?
5225083	5226065	Yeah, that's not right.
5244451	5245632	Go look it up on YouTube.
5245692	5246532	It'll be right there.
5246552	5247213	Do the 8-bit theater one.
5247273	5247673	It was right there.
5247713	5248694	Dungeons and Dragons.
5248714	5249054	That's it.
5249074	5250295	I don't want to hear the opening.
5251636	5257459	As a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons.
5259801	5262843	Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north.
5263463	5266625	You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.
5267165	5271048	The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.
5271068	5271388	Where are they?
5272810	5273812	They're right next to you.
5274133	5275295	I cast a spell!
5275415	5276698	Where's the Mountain Dew?
5276858	5278321	In the fridge, duh!
5278482	5279804	I wanna cast a spell!
5281480	5283921	Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew, just go get it.
5284161	5285562	I can cast any of these, right?
5285722	5286202	On the list?
5286282	5288203	Yes, any of the first level ones.
5288564	5290725	I'm gonna get a soda, anyone want one?
5291005	5293306	Hey, Cram, I'm not in the room, right?
5293446	5294246	What room?
5294707	5297068	I wanna cast Magic Missile.
5297088	5299409	I just wanna point out, this is exactly, this is true.
5299589	5300650	This is all true.
5300750	5305352	That's the funny thing about this video and why you people are laughing at it, because if you've ever been to play D&D, this is it.
5305672	5306753	It really is like this.
5308374	5309434	Are you a D&D player, Alan?
5310795	5310915	No.
5311630	5311870	Never?
5311890	5312791	Have you never played D&D?
5312951	5317794	I bought the rulebook, the kit, when I was in 6th or 7th grade, but I just read it.
5317854	5320255	I never actually had any friends to play with.
5320295	5320696	I'm getting a call.
5320736	5321136	I'm getting a call.
5321276	5322056	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5322076	5322377	Who's this?
5322397	5325278	This is Simon Nathan.
5325439	5326519	Hey, Nathan!
5326599	5327220	How are you?
5327320	5328400	You got any Cheetos?
5330221	5331262	You got any Mountain Dew?
5331903	5332203	Hold on.
5332423	5340548	We'll get back to the funny in a minute, but Nathan started this whole stupid D&D conversation in the first place, so you're a D&D nerd, right, Nathan?
5340568	5340648	Yeah.
5342673	5343994	and you still play D&D, right?
5344054	5344694	I'm the dungeon master.
5345155	5346355	You're the dungeon master?
5346375	5346816	Yes.
5346836	5347836	Right, okay.
5348376	5350117	I'm the gatekeeper, you're the key master.
5350217	5350598	No, no, no.
5350778	5353459	He's the dungeon master and you're the cavalier.
5353699	5354140	Alright, shush.
5354660	5357741	Alright, so you wanted to talk about me playing Dungeons & Dragons.
5357781	5361283	So what was it like to have me as your player in Dungeons & Dragons?
5363865	5367987	You do remember the orc panty seller, right?
5368907	5369688	Vaguely, yes.
5370008	5371009	Yes, I do actually.
5371049	5371509	Yes, I do.
5372955	5383184	You guys wanted to buy your fancy lingerie because all you dudes and women were playing women characters and they needed fancy lingerie.
5387328	5388769	Hey, it's important.
5390250	5391131	This is fantastic.
5391171	5391591	Keep going.
5391791	5392712	I want to hear more, please.
5396075	5397476	Did Rob roll his charisma check?
5398911	5401512	The normal go-down-kill rats in the basement.
5401672	5404313	They had to fight undead chickens.
5405614	5407054	Now, I remember that quest.
5407134	5408195	I actually distinctly remember.
5408255	5411016	That was like one of the first... I think it was like the first or second night we ever played.
5411056	5412836	We did the undead chickens in the basement.
5412916	5414917	But I have to know, did Rob make his charisma rolls?
5419579	5420399	Did he save or fail?
5421319	5421780	All right, stop.
5422020	5423240	Let the man talk, DarkSakura.
5424621	5425101	So, um...
5426727	5427568	No, that's Panda Lady's
5447144	5448525	Sister is here visiting.
5448885	5449545	Oh, say hello.
5449585	5451665	Tell what we said hello and send our love from OLR.
5453426	5455066	What was I going to ask?
5455206	5456047	Yes, Rice Princess.
5456307	5457747	Say hello and all that.
5458027	5460448	What was I going to say about... Oh, yes.
5461708	5463549	How was it having me in your game?
5463569	5467090	Because Alan really likes to hear stories about how terrible my ex was.
5468850	5472951	How was it having me in the game versus having my ex in the game, allegedly?
5474792	5474872	It
5476753	5478594	It took extra time.
5478674	5479955	He slowed things down.
5481135	5493781	Your very first quest, you were in a basement with shelves, and he decided that he wanted to climb these shelves to get a better look at the surroundings of the basement.
5500211	5508675	I can see that happening once, but he tried it at least three times, one of which he rolled a natural one and knocked over the shelf.
5510716	5513778	Which is just like real life, allegedly.
5515179	5516219	This is fantastic.
5518940	5519901	Oh, yeah.
5520061	5522882	He was interesting.
5523483	5524803	He was special.
5525404	5526404	But he's not here anymore.
5526444	5527425	That's the important thing, right?
5528665	5529886	He kept thinking that
5530771	5535493	The cleric was a priest and he kept trying to cast his wow spells in D&D.
5535753	5536374	Cast smite.
5536614	5538735	Smite.
5538955	5540435	I want the bubble.
5540535	5541436	I'll cast a bubble.
5541456	5542896	I want to cast a bubble.
5547178	5549740	Nathan's laughing because he knows I'm telling the truth.
5551260	5553401	You're not exaggerating anything.
5553661	5554962	That's exactly what happened.
5558942	5560003	Good times, good times.
5561284	5566768	Sadly, I'm not playing D&D with you guys anymore because I travel to the Bay pretty much every weekend when you guys play.
5567148	5570210	But what kind of adventures do you do in D&D now?
5572932	5575734	Right now, they're not too ridiculous.
5578876	5585581	But there was a big asshole who everyone kind of hates who's the big hero of the town.
5586522	5587703	His name's Larbio.
5588670	5591191	and he's modeled after Fabio.
5592032	5594893	Only more sexual harassment involved.
5595273	5597014	Does his hair have its own saving throw?
5599035	5599295	What?
5599455	5600916	Does his hair have its own saving throw?
5603337	5610261	No, but he did have commercials for a fancy type of butter.
5610781	5612942	I can't believe it's not butter light.
5613342	5616744	And the thing about that was it glowed in the dark.
5618962	5619862	That's fantastic.
5622203	5623164	Your games totally rock.
5624845	5625505	Yeah, I know.
5626765	5627166	Alright.
5629147	5631908	One of these days, Nathan, I'm going to have to drop in and make a cameo.
5632108	5635430	If I could find my old character sheet, although to be honest, I think it's long gone.
5635470	5640312	I think it's in that box of things that remind me of the X that got shredded when I left.
5640352	5641733	So sadly, I don't know if I have it anymore.
5642073	5644334	But I'll have to make a cameo at some point in your game.
5644795	5645235	It'll be fun.
5645894	5649097	Every once in a while we've done some drunk D&D nights.
5649137	5651119	We've done two of those so far.
5651580	5656585	And Eddie has actually come to those.
5656825	5666114	And one time we played the campaign module that the guys from Penny Arcade had made and was making fun of the Twilight movies.
5667796	5668317	Very nice.
5669621	5672644	So, yeah, you're more than welcome to stop by.
5673225	5676048	That would be a perfect time because we don't do any big campaigns.
5676088	5679672	It's just something stupid and we get drunk and laugh.
5679772	5681013	I will absolutely do that.
5681133	5682214	And I'll cast Bubble.
5682455	5683295	Can I cast Bubble?
5685838	5686038	No.
5686439	5686599	No.
5686699	5688241	This is not wild.
5688937	5715782	and that's exactly how Nathan would have to respond to like trying to bite his tongue like you could sense he just wants to jump over the table and be like you're fucking ruining my fucking game you little shit like you just no you can't you can't you can't do that this is this is D&D you not wow it's not no no all right Nathan thank you so much for calling in and good luck with the D&D okay no problem you have a good time the rest of your hours oh we will take care buddy all right bye
5716198	5720359	I'm gonna call him For this incarnation I'm gonna yell at him right now
5755091	5755351	Hello?
5755571	5756312	Hi Shane, how are you?
5756372	5756752	It's Rob.
5758012	5758973	Hello, I'm good.
5759113	5760654	You're live on the radio, et cetera, et cetera.
5761014	5761674	You playing WoW?
5761694	5762534	You playing the beta?
5762875	5763435	Yeah.
5763555	5764895	No, no, no, I wasn't playing the beta.
5764956	5765756	I was fishing.
5765936	5766376	Okay, hold on.
5766416	5768437	I have to ask you a question because this is really important, okay?
5768897	5769938	I'll have to answer it.
5769958	5770638	No, you do.
5770958	5772399	How did we meet?
5774212	5774592	No, I don't.
5774612	5775393	I don't pay attention.
5801684	5803706	It's just words that come out of the radio.
5803746	5806769	I'm like, okay, if there's something that's interesting, I'll pick it up.
5806809	5808011	But a phone number?
5808892	5810713	Nah.
5810733	5814938	1-877-GAME-OLR Oh, see, I was going to dial 1-866.
5814958	5817861	And then I think I got the other two things right.
5817901	5819723	And I was like, wait, that could be wrong.
5819903	5820784	I might get like...
5821499	5832543	You know, a porn line or something Yeah, it's 877, just for the future Just so you know Alright, well, I'm calling you because you were telling me about a bunch of cool stuff you saw this past week So where were you?
5832583	5833363	What was going on?
5833423	5835644	I don't know what you can and can't say Where were you at?
5835704	5836344	What were you doing?
5836784	5837224	What's cool?
5837244	5847068	I was at the GameStop Managers Conference in Austin, but not San Antonio Is there... What's awesome in San Antonio?
5847268	5847588	Anyone?
5847968	5850109	The Alamo Did you go to the Alamo?
5851184	5852585	No, I'm not a tourist.
5853306	5855448	I don't care about that stuff.
5855528	5859431	I don't even know what the Alamo is because I think people died there or something.
5860532	5861953	Can you say tortilla?
5862493	5863054	Tortilla.
5865086	5865606	Is that Showgirls?
5865827	5870230	Oh, I think they played a clip of that at our conference because it was like she was in a phone booth and
5888144	5889387	The stars at night shine big and bright
5901095	5903496	I don't think it will if I end in rape or shooting
5922386	5924367	The first time I went to, whoa, that's loud.
5924708	5928930	The first time I went to a manager's conference in Texas, that was exactly the first thing I did.
5929631	5930652	Was it?
5930712	5931472	I called Mystique.
5931832	5934014	It was like, hey, I'm in Texas.
5934414	5935595	Listen, I'll prove it.
5936636	5937696	And the people played along.
5937736	5938317	It was amazing.
5940418	5940778	Nice.
5941199	5944101	Well, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to the conference this year, Dan.
5944561	5946782	Well, I haven't gone to a GameStop conference for a while.
5946862	5947623	I'm missing, I know.
5947943	5949224	Yes, I'm sorry I did too.
5949284	5949764	I was like, uh...
5951451	5956656	Alright, so tell us, I don't know what you can or can't tell us about the conference, Shane, but tell us about your experience there at the conference.
5958057	5958818	Oh, let's see.
5959178	5961240	Well, I'll start off with some highs.
5962522	5967586	The very first thing that we had to see, we were broken into groups, so we had to go to different vendors.
5967666	5976675	The very first thing we saw in my group was a trailer of tons of different fatalities from the new Mortal Kombat game, and they were hilarious.
5977208	5978790	Any that you remember?
5979590	5979770	What?
5980451	5981292	Any that you remember?
5982272	5983513	Oh, yeah.
5983554	5987677	There was one where a reptile threw up in somebody's mouth, like a whole bunch of acid.
5987717	5988418	That was funny.
5988438	5990299	I think I saw a porn like that once, actually.
5991881	6003931	There was one where Sector blew up somebody's torso into a few different pieces, and as the pieces were flying up into the air, he locked onto each individual piece and shot missiles at them, so it made them explode even more.
6003951	6004551	Okay.
6005212	6005332	Um...
6005902	6023450	There was one where Skurkin cut right through the guy at the waistline and he didn't fall over or anything and then he cut the guy through the neck all the way through and then he kicked the torso so just the torso flew and then the head flew up and he took his little knife and sliced the head in half.
6023470	6025431	I was like, oh, that's hilarious.
6026552	6027913	This is sounding like a Saw movie.
6027933	6029473	What were the stage ones?
6029513	6030534	Did you see any of those?
6031992	6051367	No, they didn't show any stage ones, but they did show in the new acid pit place, or old acid pit place, I guess you would call it, one of the background dudes that was hanging, like, you saw him get dipped into the acid, and he was, like, screaming and freaking out, and then they pulled him back up, and he wasn't on a skeleton, he was, like, this fleshy, dead...
6053724	6054705	That's fantastic.
6055346	6057608	Was it like the Mortal Kombat 2 acid pit?
6058428	6058789	Yeah.
6059349	6060010	Nice.
6061030	6062011	Oh, I want this game.
6062231	6063773	That sounds hot.
6063933	6068657	I don't know if this has come out yet, but I don't care.
6069197	6074802	They had tag team combo things like they do in the Marvel vs. Capcom games.
6074862	6078685	So you could be beating somebody up and then tag in another partner and they'll jump right in.
6079605	6080346	Oh, wow.
6080366	6082667	Yeah, it was crazy cool.
6083188	6083728	That's interesting.
6083748	6086530	So they stole that from Marvel vs. Capcom, it sounds like.
6086751	6087251	It's awesome.
6088132	6091494	Yeah, and I don't know if any other games did it before, but probably not.
6092555	6094316	Let's see, what else was cool there?
6096358	6097219	Not a lot.
6100281	6103884	No, that was the coolest thing I think I saw, which is kind of sad.
6104664	6105845	I did get to play Diablo 3.
6106906	6107827	I didn't know how to play it.
6108280	6111281	I tried to play it like WoW and that got me killed pretty quick and nice.
6111341	6112161	It's like, okay, I'm done.
6112281	6112662	I give up.
6112842	6113242	It's cool.
6114242	6115022	I need to play it.
6115122	6117663	I understand that I'm terrible at it and I won't buy it.
6118204	6119044	You're not going to buy it.
6119104	6119984	Diablo is awesome.
6120905	6122065	I like it better than StarCraft.
6122085	6123305	I'm going to get my budget for StarCraft.
6123325	6127247	I'm not buying StarCraft either, but if they give me a WoW pet, maybe I'll get it.
6128387	6129087	Well, what have you been doing?
6129107	6131568	Because I know you were able to get into the Cata Beta as well.
6132229	6133429	What have you been doing in the Cata Beta?
6135060	6144742	I have played a Worgen up to 12 almost, and then a Goblin up to 4, because that's where the quest is currently broken and we can't proceed.
6145582	6147583	The Worgen's pretty cool.
6148283	6149443	The game doesn't feel like WoW.
6149683	6150563	I'll say that right now.
6150643	6156565	It does not feel like the same game we've been playing for so many years, just going through the Worgen and Goblin experience.
6156645	6161526	But the Worgen's all depressing, and, oh, we've got to save our home from these attacks.
6161666	6162966	Oh, my God, we're going to die.
6163619	6171464	and I was like, let me get some bling glasses and I got running over people with my car and it's the best.
6171764	6173845	Love the Goblin area so, so much.
6173865	6176106	I was laughing the entire time.
6176126	6177327	I didn't know what to do at first.
6177347	6177587	I was like,
6184935	6187076	I'm really close to this guy, why am I not throwing the barrel?
6187116	6188777	No, you have to get right up next to him.
6188797	6191399	But yeah, that was pretty funny and I laughed at that.
6191559	6193100	That was awesome.
6193640	6197982	I'm going to do a spoiler for the Worgen questline, you know, whatever.
6198183	6198783	Sure.
6198843	6200784	Because it was a fun glitch that happened.
6201124	6212991	There's a part where you're fighting Sylvanas and the whole town is fighting Sylvanas and she knocks you back and she's about to shoot Gen Greymane, the leader of the Worgen people.
6213664	6215225	with this poison arrow, I guess.
6215586	6218668	But instead, his son jumps up front to take the arrow.
6219189	6222411	But when I played, she was facing the opposite direction.
6222771	6228156	So she shot, like, facing to the screen's left, and the prince was right behind her.
6228596	6229517	But it still killed him.
6229537	6229817	I was like...
6230717	6231957	That just ruins the mood.
6232397	6234398	I didn't see that part.
6234458	6235638	It just skipped over it, I think.
6235658	6237219	I didn't read that at all.
6237259	6237939	It's in the church.
6237979	6238199	Oh, yeah.
6238219	6242740	I knew there was one there, but I didn't see anything on the screen telling me that something was going to happen.
6242840	6244121	I knew it was going to happen, but...
6262022	6287292	I don't really care about my worgen nearly as much as I care about the goblin now because the goblin is so funny like the music is all like I don't know whimsical when you play as a goblin in your radio that goes only to 11 but yeah I like it it's not wow what we're used to but it's neat to the evolution of the game
6288448	6290470	Alright, you haven't checked out any of the new areas yet?
6290490	6291611	Because that's what I'm waiting to do.
6291631	6294293	I want my stupid character to copy over so I can check out the new areas.
6294753	6296915	I still can't get my character to copy over.
6297695	6300577	I'm at Darkshore now.
6300938	6301818	I think that's where I'm at.
6302759	6307542	So I'll get to see that area redone, but no character copying over.
6307562	6309044	It's making me a little sad.
6310365	6311425	I was having the same problem.
6311686	6312106	What can you do?
6313058	6317623	Yes, like a month ago, I wouldn't have ever said this, but I think I'm a huge Microsoft down boy now.
6317643	6317703	Why?
6337523	6338263	So your loyalty can be bought?
6338283	6338343	Yes.
6338363	6340504	So if I pay you like $20, you'll wear like an Orange Lounge radio sticker to work?
6340524	6340944	I'll wear a sticker?
6340964	6341044	Yeah.
6341065	6341545	Can I wear stickers?
6341565	6342505	Will you wear a shirt?
6342565	6345226	No, I can't wear a shirt that says Orange Lounge to work.
6345246	6345466	Fail.
6366756	6368798	but I'll pretend and I'll still take the $20.
6368838	6371480	That's not going to cut it.
6371521	6372502	I'll wear that sticker.
6372962	6374944	Alright, we're letting you go.
6375084	6377647	You're useless to me without being able to promote.
6377727	6379349	Alright, take care.
6380270	6380830	Alright, you too.
6380950	6381271	Bye.
6382192	6383513	Alright, thank you Shane for being on.
6383533	6384454	Appreciate the phone calls.
6385375	6386015	Good times.
6389904	6396432	Let's see, which would... Oh, I never played the rest of this Dungeons & Dragons thing, so should I finish this, even though the mood is gone?
6396853	6398234	Or start it over.
6398695	6399456	Alright, why not?
6400137	6401658	Dungeons & Dragons
6402572	6403753	Satan's Game.
6404633	6420384	Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.
6421064	6427451	This afternoon, the Dead Alewives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.
6428111	6437041	Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons & Dragons.
6439417	6440118	Galstaff.
6440638	6442440	You have entered the door to the north.
6443061	6446225	You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.
6446765	6450670	The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.
6450730	6452091	Where are the Cheetos?
6452411	6453433	They're right next to you.
6453753	6454914	I cast a spell.
6455054	6456316	Where's the Mountain Dew?
6456456	6457918	In the fridge, duh.
6458098	6459459	I want to cast a spell.
6459479	6460000	Can I have a
6461067	6462708	Yes, you can have them out and do.
6462768	6463528	Just go get it.
6463749	6465169	I can cast any of these, right?
6465310	6465810	On the list?
6465890	6467791	Yes, any of the first level ones.
6467871	6469152	I'm going to get a soda.
6469212	6470332	Anyone want one?
6470613	6472914	Hey, Cram, I'm not in the room, right?
6473054	6473854	What room?
6474315	6476676	I want to cast Magic Missile.
6476696	6479618	The room where he's casting all these spells from.
6479678	6481559	He hasn't cast anything yet.
6481939	6483280	I am, though, if you'd listen.
6483420	6485341	I'm casting Magic Missile.
6485461	6487022	Why are you casting Magic Missile?
6487042	6488363	There's nothing to attack here.
6490051	6491512	I'm attacking the darkness!
6494834	6495754	Fine, fine.
6496035	6497255	You attack the darkness.
6497556	6498936	There's an elf in front of you.
6498956	6499577	Whoa!
6499717	6500417	That's me, right?
6500737	6506141	He's wearing a brown tunic, and he has gray hair and blue eyes.
6506261	6506921	No, I don't.
6507001	6507842	I have gray eyes.
6508502	6509303	Let me see that sheet.
6509443	6513325	Well, it says I have blue, but I decided I wanted gray eyes.
6513405	6513905	Whatever.
6514005	6516367	Okay, you guys can talk to each other now if you want.
6517932	6518292	Hello.
6518852	6519313	Hello.
6519893	6522434	I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.
6522794	6524735	Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?
6528036	6529697	You guys are being attacked.
6531753	6534094	No, you're outside by the tavern.
6534174	6535495	Cool, I get drunk.
6536495	6538837	There are seven ogres surrounding you.
6538977	6539997	How could they surround us?
6540117	6542358	I had Mordenkainen's magical watchdog cast.
6542418	6543079	No, you didn't.
6543239	6544199	I'm getting drunk.
6544319	6545620	Are there any girls there?
6545700	6546620	I totally did.
6546660	6550082	You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no.
6550402	6555485	But I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainen's faithful watchdog.
6555505	6557105	But you never actually cast it.
6557225	6559687	Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk.
6560567	6561547	Yeah, you are.
6561747	6563188	Are there any girls there?
6563208	6563628	Yeah.
6563828	6564628	I did, though.
6564748	6566748	I completely said when you asked me.
6566848	6567629	No, you didn't.
6567929	6570669	You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell.
6570709	6572210	So now there's ogres, okay?
6572390	6572930	Ogres?
6573270	6575170	Man, I got an ogre slaying knife.
6575250	6577431	It's got a plus nine against ogres.
6577451	6578411	You're not there.
6578471	6579531	You're getting drunk.
6579671	6583352	Okay, but if there's any girls there, I want to do them.
6583752	6584773	There you have it.
6585193	6588954	A frightening look into America's most frightening pastime.
6589515	6595457	Remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare.
6596118	6601440	It's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast when they couldn't do one single pull-up.
6603561	6603961	All true.
6604422	6604722	All of it.
6605502	6606242	Yes.
6606463	6607063	100% true.
6607643	6608764	Including the pull-up.
6614189	6617912	I actually, you know, funny enough, Nathan thinks that he popped my D&D cherry, but that's not true.
6617952	6620134	I actually played in high school with some friends of mine.
6620454	6626839	I hadn't played in years and years after that, but there was a little group of us in high school that used to play, and it was fun.
6627320	6629161	One of my friends was really into it.
6629201	6632864	He would talk about the campaign at times that wasn't appropriate.
6633004	6633685	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6656565	6669548	I don't know, but you, me, and Ben will all start talking about WoW like, oh yeah, there was that raid yesterday and oh man, the fight and if we'd only done this differently and you can see Jim and Victoria looking at each other like how far away are we from the bar?
6675969	6676529	Good times.
6676769	6678850	And what are we going to do as soon as we get back to your place?
6680433	6692958	We gotta run the daily, that's why this marathon has to be over before 3am when the frickin' servers reset 4, 4am I'm kidding, I'm kidding, God We missed the daily yesterday, Friday?
6693679	6699441	Two days ago Didn't kill us We didn't do a daily That's alright, we'll be okay So you owe me two frosts, I'm very upset
6701351	6703012	Well, I... Okay.
6703293	6704534	Okay, kids.
6704654	6705434	I told Alan.
6705674	6714721	I'm like, Alan, you might want to mark yourself tentative for the raid Monday because I don't know if we're going to be able to run because you're going to be visiting me and, you know... We might go out for Labor Day.
6714762	6716143	Yeah, we might go out because it's Labor Day.
6716163	6716983	You know, I have the day off.
6717023	6717624	And Alan's like...
6719378	6719818	I'm just helping.
6719838	6720019	I'm just...
6747731	6773073	You should be saying, oh, yes Come to dinner with me Let me get you outside the house at 8 o'clock Let's get ice cream tomorrow Let's go to Pinkberry Let's go to Pinkberry No, here's the thing, I'm going to tell Alan We will go to Pinkberry tomorrow, but we're only going to go to Pinkberry At 7.50 That's the only time we can go to Pinkberry
6774200	6776522	Pinkberry's closed the rest of the day for inventory.
6776742	6777262	It's fine.
6777403	6778523	I'm just playing along.
6778744	6779404	No, I know.
6779644	6779904	I know.
6781105	6781445	Let's see.
6782426	6785869	Jvmon in chat says, I was going to play WoW with my boyfriend, but then he dumped me.
6788230	6789531	Debbie Downer.
6790152	6790412	No, but...
6790816	6791256	You know what?
6791837	6793798	The couple that games together stays together.
6794019	6796140	Or at least appreciates each other's nerddom.
6796160	6810052	Like, I've dated guys in the past, you know, and I've talked about this in the past on the show, is that part of the difficulty of being gay sometimes is that most gay guys you meet are like, let's talk about fashion, let's talk about Madonna, or oh my god, Lady Gaga, you know, all this stuff.
6810132	6818739	And, you know, it's just like, I'm not, like, you know, I like Lady Gaga, I guess, but as far as, like, all that other stuff, like, I'm not, like, into that.
6819119	6823320	Just play classes with different armor classes so you don't have to roll against the same loot.
6825201	6826961	And you will have a happy relationship.
6828702	6831622	Clothy and a plate, you never have to roll on the same loot.
6832503	6833703	You'll be together for years.
6837604	6838784	Hold on, we're getting a call.
6839244	6840485	Oh, damn it, I just missed it.
6840545	6841345	That's alright, I'll call him back.
6842105	6842965	I'll call him, I don't care.
6843166	6843626	We'll call him.
6845006	6847827	Because he's a WoW guildie, and so I'm sure he has some insight on this.
6848757	6849077	Hi.
6849678	6850759	I saw you were trying to call.
6851039	6851259	No.
6851639	6852320	No, no, no, no, no.
6852380	6853681	You're not taking no days off.
6856583	6858525	You and Alan take off, a.k.a.
6858685	6861547	you the best healer, Alan the best DPS.
6862228	6864209	We're going to be in a lot of trouble for our guild.
6864550	6866411	So, no, you're not taking tomorrow off.
6866491	6867432	I understand it's a holiday.
6867492	6868293	You schedule it.
6868313	6869173	You're going to show up.
6869353	6870534	You know that's part of the deal.
6871015	6872076	I want my frost badges.
6872216	6873517	I want my T10 pants.
6873937	6875999	I can't get my T10 pants unless you guys show up.
6876744	6878525	They have to go get Pinkberry with me.
6878545	6881328	You can get Pinkberry afterwards.
6881388	6881968	It won't take that long.
6882028	6884230	No, Pinkberry closes at 10 o'clock.
6884270	6885091	Thank you very much.
6885691	6888053	We don't stop rating until 10, 30, 11 o'clock.
6888473	6889874	What's more important?
6889954	6890695	God damn it.
6890735	6891576	What's more important?
6891616	6897900	Two Frost Badges or fucking original Pinkberry with watermelon and mango?
6899121	6900803	Frost Badges because I could care less.
6902053	6903575	I'm not playing Star Trek Online right now.
6904575	6905496	What is wrong with you?
6905937	6907458	You're supposed to be supporting me in this.
6907798	6909059	Oh, Alan, come over.
6909099	6910460	You can use my computer to raid.
6911221	6912022	Screw you, lady.
6912562	6913142	Rob, Rob, Rob.
6913223	6919808	No, because I forgot that the little sale is going on and I have some cryptic points left to spend and it's cheap right now.
6920028	6920949	It's a sale, Rob.
6920969	6923091	You are denying a woman a sale.
6924412	6924952	For shame.
6925553	6927074	Go raid with your party.
6928035	6929376	Crossing very thin lines here.
6931331	6931872	No, I'm kidding.
6931912	6932753	No, it's cool, man.
6932793	6933674	You gotta take a day off.
6933794	6934575	No, I'm just kidding.
6934615	6935757	It's just funny the way you just said it.
6935777	6936298	You're like, you know what?
6936338	6937019	We don't need a show.
6937099	6937379	What?
6937700	6938841	No, I don't think so.
6940143	6940844	You know better.
6942808	6943629	Alan, any comment?
6943809	6950273	See, for those listening that have been considering playing WoW, this is what is waiting for you in the future.
6950333	6951274	This is real.
6952034	6953535	This is, yeah.
6954256	6960860	This is like an episode of, I don't know, Intervention and VH1 behind the guild right here.
6963662	6964843	Nah, I love both of you guys.
6964883	6965163	Nah.
6965744	6966704	It's all your fault, Rob.
6966745	6967825	You got me addicted on it.
6967925	6968386	No, I know.
6968426	6968966	Congratulations.
6968986	6969787	I'm a bad person.
6969827	6970167	It's fine.
6971098	6971938	Our phone's ringing.
6971998	6973539	I guess I should take another call, alright?
6974279	6974859	Alright, Rob.
6975039	6977540	I still love you guys regardless if you show up or not.
6977680	6978060	No homo.
6986963	6990003	That was the most unenthusiastic kissing noise I've ever heard in my life.
6995005	6997245	I can't take it anymore.
6997265	6998546	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6998586	6999006	Who's this?
7000236	7001657	What time is the raid tomorrow?
7001677	7003678	Because I might be level 8 and I want to come.
7004118	7004518	Yes.
7006019	7006819	Oh my god.
7009720	7010020	Okay.
7010601	7011281	Hold on, folks.
7012881	7017646	We do a show here called Orange Lounge Radio where we talk about gaming and gaming culture.
7017706	7023491	This is not the Danger Squad updates and important bulletins.
7023671	7030318	I can just see there in guild chat now, that bitch just said he ain't coming to raid with us tomorrow because he got a pink berry.
7030578	7031319	That fat bitch.
7033361	7033901	Like, really?
7034622	7036604	Oh, 8 o'clock Pacific.
7038277	7039757	So, okay, 10 o'clock.
7039958	7040678	I want to go raid.
7040698	7041858	What are you guys raiding?
7042538	7044019	They're doing ICC, the second half.
7044379	7047900	They're trying to do progression, so if you're in greens and blues, I don't know if that's a good idea.
7047920	7049341	I want to be in tier 9, but you can still take me.
7050761	7052542	We took somebody in greens and blues last week.
7052582	7053922	I don't see why we wouldn't do it again.
7054242	7055122	You need to talk to Tim.
7057003	7057943	Whatever, sure.
7058083	7061324	What's his radio show calling?
7065248	7068672	I can make a joke here, but I don't want to out what he does, so I better not.
7070074	7071075	You have a good one, Shane.
7071696	7072036	Go raid.
7072897	7073097	Bye.
7075340	7076862	He better be doing his daily every day.
7080274	7081315	Okay, I spent my points.
7081395	7082075	Now I'm logging out.
7082375	7083576	I'm a rear admiral, Rob.
7084197	7084677	That's funny.
7085017	7085858	A rear admiral.
7086978	7087419	Let's see.
7088499	7093542	Anonymous123 in our chatroom says, When you hear WoW talk and you've never played, you wish you could understand.
7093582	7097085	When you play or haven't played WoW and you understand WoW talk, you wish you didn't understand.
7098946	7100206	This is a good question.
7100267	7102588	Define what a raid is for our listeners, Alan.
7105367	7106508	DJ Blaziken again.
7134815	7136096	What's on your mind, DJ Blazkid?
7137797	7139419	Well, not much.
7139659	7145363	Just putzing around Virtual Liberty City in GTA Ballad of Gay Tony now.
7145884	7146204	Mm-hmm.
7147725	7150647	Finally getting past that stupid chopper mission.
7150888	7151168	Mm-hmm.
7152669	7154791	But, okay, I don't know.
7154891	7158994	Has anyone here played Metal Gear by chance?
7159514	7162517	No, none of us in here have played Oh, No, The Truck Have Started to Move.
7162537	7163798	The Truck Have Started to Move.
7166012	7168674	Basically, I'm stuck on the Psycho Mantis battle.
7194914	7195935	That was the best battle.
7195955	7200979	It made me almost want to crack my PSP in half as we speak.
7201099	7202620	I see you are a careful man.
7203161	7204081	You save often.
7207264	7210506	I don't know if it does this on the PSP, but it was so hardcore.
7210526	7215029	That guy would read your memory card, and if you played other Konami games, he would freaking know.
7215410	7218192	And he'd be like, oh, you like to play Castlevania, do you?
7218272	7219573	And you'd be like, oh my god!
7219953	7221434	I'm possessed by the devil!
7223207	7229093	Because I have a Castlevania save on there and a DDR save on there, just for a random point.
7230053	7235959	And let's just say here, yeah, you've read that, and you're like, you know, Rhythm Banner, something around those lines.
7236439	7248350	But on top of also anger management and gaming, another thing that almost made me want to break on my controllers and or system is Guitar Hero 3, the freaking devil battle.
7249457	7257860	I lost so many times on Hard, an expert to that guy What was that song in Guitar Hero 3 that killed me?
7262402	7273386	That song in Guitar Hero 3 that used to kill me was the Muse song, the Knights of Cydonia I probably broke my guitar over that, I don't know how many times
7274381	7277323	Oh my god, but that's an epic song in itself.
7277403	7278403	It is a pretty epic song.
7278823	7280364	Alright, we gotta let you go.
7281085	7281665	Hurry up, hurry up.
7281705	7282305	What's your last thought?
7283926	7286948	Um... Oh god, no.
7287548	7288368	Oh, right.
7289169	7295432	I tried, well, the War Puffer tried to activate a trial account, and it won't work.
7296393	7296793	Why not?
7297193	7298774	I got a little trial disk and everything.
7298834	7299394	It won't work.
7299434	7300014	Well, what'd you do?
7300795	7301035	I don't...
7302665	7303506	You broke it!
7303546	7305127	You broke WoW!
7306928	7308428	Call Blizzard, technical support.
7309109	7315392	The trial accounts are so crippled because of people, spammers use trial accounts so they can spam without having to pay.
7315772	7322196	So the accounts are so crippled, like when I played with a trial account like two years ago, I hated it because I couldn't do anything.
7322636	7325578	And then when I actually paid for it, it's like, oh, this is a completely different game.
7326978	7328979	So is it worth it for the $15?
7329020	7329760	Because I've
7330502	7331062	I got a wife.
7347458	7350940	and I play other games other than just one.
7351200	7353001	Can I say this here real quickly about Warcraft?
7353341	7363527	The reason why I play so much Warcraft is because of the social element and a lot of my friends play and it's so much fun to raid with them and stuff and it's always fun to meet new people too that are like you and stuff.
7363587	7364427	First off, two things.
7365148	7374593	Apparently this has suddenly turned into the Robin Allen Guild radio show because one of the guild members who I've never seen join chat before joined and said, what do you mean Alan has the best DPS?
7374613	7376034	Yeah.
7377174	7403702	I finally figured out because I've been watching the guild the old web series and I've finally figured out the whole some of the emphasis and some of the lingo the thing is she really did play WoW and that's why like that series is so spot on because I'm sure it's a lot like some of it is probably like you know obviously fiction like some of the weird dating storylines to get into but a lot of the stuff they talk about in game is so true
7406139	7410546	Okay, what about the stuff in the South Park Make Love Not Warcraft episode?
7411241	7436152	Mom, bathroom And this is I just got a screenshot from one of the guild members Who apparently, yes, in guild chat At 1.56am I'm assuming that's eastern time One of the guildies said That bitch ain't coming to raid tomorrow because he's going to get Pinkberry That fat bitch I just got a screenshot of somebody talking shit about me in guild Wow I know they're listening too If it's one something that would be central time
7437452	7445080	Actually, one of my girlfriends ended up breaking up with me via Wi-Fi connection on a live Metroid Time Hunters game where we could do voice chat.
7445821	7446642	We had friend codes.
7447142	7450606	Everyone in the whole room heard it.
7451186	7452988	And then my character died.
7453889	7455471	I was just like, wow.
7456372	7456692	Worst.
7457185	7461067	Basically, it was because I was a gamer and so she
7485871	7490019	She said, either you quit gaming or I dump you and get this.
7490059	7495810	This girl was a cheerleader and freshman and I was kind of done with my life trying to find love.
7497409	7499470	Well, you know what?
7499630	7499990	You know what?
7500030	7513820	If there's one lesson we could teach you here on Orange Lounge Radio, look, I want all the young men to listen up because I know we have some strapping young lads that are, what, between 16 and 21 that listen to this show, young guys trying to find the girl of their dreams and so forth.
7514180	7521925	This is what I want to teach you, and JB, back me up on this, is that if a woman is going to break up with you because you play too many games, she's a bitch.
7522385	7522766	Yes.
7524146	7526068	She's a bitch, and you can do better.
7527489	7531151	And that's... I'm dating a girl who knows more about anime than I do.
7531271	7531831	There you go.
7531851	7533292	Well, she's just a nerd.
7533332	7533992	But that's okay.
7534032	7534673	Nerds are okay.
7535253	7535553	Alright.
7536033	7536474	Alright, buddy.
7536494	7537194	We're gonna let you go.
7537234	7537954	Have a good one, buddy.
7538735	7538995	Alright.
7539035	7539535	Alright, later.
7541416	7545158	There's one thing you could learn from Orange Laundry.
7545539	7548920	It's... I'm not saying if a girl doesn't play games, she's a bitch.
7548980	7552723	That's... But if a girl doesn't understand, you gotta respect the games.
7553603	7554083	She's a bitch.
7557560	7583994	I'm gonna get so much hate mail alright well I think I don't know if it's like honey get the keys the baby's coming now and it's like Festergut is at 20% the baby is harshing my mellow right now good news everybody the baby is coming hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this wait wait let me hear it straight did you say raid or rave cause I got my glow sticks here ready for tomorrow night
7588539	7589279	Why not both?
7589519	7591220	Let's rave during the raid.
7591300	7591700	Why not?
7592200	7593021	Light switch raid!
7593661	7597022	Have you been trying to call us for 30 minutes just to make that joke?
7599523	7604824	No, but it's not like you said raid or rave, so I had to call in just to say something about it.
7605084	7605525	Raid.
7605765	7606525	R-A-I-D.
7606785	7608145	Use it to kill insects.
7608746	7611807	I know, I know, but I just couldn't resist raid.
7612387	7612867	Why not?
7613527	7613807	Alright.
7614328	7614508	Bye.
7616932	7617092	Yeah, no!
7617112	7617272	Yeah!
7646408	7646728	DarkSakura.com
7670467	7670707	Okay.
7671027	7672589	And then... Oh, yeah.
7672629	7674930	I gotta play the one you sent me or you're gonna throw a fit.
7675631	7676952	I actually got an email from Jamie.
7676972	7678113	This is play this, ho-bag.
7678513	7679514	That was actually the subject.
7680835	7681976	She's so respectful.
7683717	7684477	So respectful.
7685598	7685938	Alright.
7686699	7689141	Big thanks to those of you guys that have been listening the entire time.
7689201	7690162	Like, I don't know how you do it.
7690202	7690962	You guys are crazy.
7691623	7693064	Like, I can barely tolerate being here.
7693624	7693864	Alright.
7693884	7695085	I'll just leave it all in the other room.
7695566	7695826	Alright.
7695846	7696046	I'll leave...
7697346	7700068	All right, we'll be right back, guys, with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon.
7700408	7702089	I don't know what we're going to do in the next segment.
7702109	7703069	Just tune in and find out.
7703089	7705371	We'll be back after this break here at All Games Radio.
7711814	7713435	Hi, and now we're back, everybody.
7713455	7717017	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on Hour 9 of our marathon episode.
7717037	7718999	We started at 2 o'clock today, and it's now 1116.
7720099	7724862	Yes, we are taping here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
7725782	7726103	Sorry, we...
7726863	7728144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7752759	7753139	Oh, okay.
7753199	7753660	Sounds good.
7754120	7754580	He'll be back.
7754680	7755080	Okay, good.
7755961	7757181	That's why Dan's not in here.
7757241	7759282	He's ignoring us in favor of video games.
7759403	7759843	That's fine.
7760123	7762804	Yeah, we asked Dan to come play a match game, but he's like, I'm in the middle of a game.
7765406	7765726	All right.
7766146	7768387	How about more Facebook questions from earlier?
7768947	7769768	Let's do it, Rob.
7769808	7770348	And you know what?
7770748	7771709	I feel energetic.
7772452	7774213	I feel like we could go longer
7792664	7798187	Well, I make mine with decaf, but decaf still has caffeine in it, except I make it kind of strong with a good scoop of Hershey's Cocoa in it.
7799047	7808171	And then I add some Splenda and about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and use a soy creamer after I add the water.
7808191	7812773	So it actually tastes like sort of intermediate chocolate.
7812793	7813574	It sounds so hippie.
7813774	7814414	It's really good.
7814554	7814914	All right.
7815074	7815795	I'll take your word for it.
7816075	7816475	Do you want some?
7817375	7817775	Maybe later.
7817835	7818076	We'll see.
7818336	7820437	I'm not tired yet, but give me about another hour.
7820457	7821017	We'll see how we do.
7821597	7823377	I say we beat 12 o'clock.
7824078	7826178	Well, we've only got 45 minutes to go.
7826718	7827458	We'll probably beat it.
7827798	7828319	Hi, Bradley.
7828479	7829239	Play some more Para.
7829639	7830879	We're going to be doing a list list.
7831579	7833680	It's cheating, though, if I play too much music.
7833720	7837801	Playing about 10 minutes every hour, that's okay, because we need to be able to take breaks and stuff like that.
7837841	7839261	But if I play much more than that, we're cheating.
7840601	7841201	Bradley, hi.
7841421	7842902	We're going to be doing a list list here shortly.
7842962	7848063	Tonight's topic, if you want to start thinking about this, and I know Bradley's going to want to think about this because he needs to get his list together.
7850540	7854067	Thing I most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011
7859466	7862247	It's going to be the topic tonight, so start thinking about that and get your list down.
7862267	7865187	The thing I most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011.
7868428	7871929	Meanwhile, more Facebook questions that we got earlier this week.
7872989	7876130	We had Liam earlier ask us, what is our favorite video game of all time?
7876170	7876770	What about this?
7877450	7881451	John on Facebook asked a very similar question, not just what is the best video game ever...
7882131	7885594	What is the worst video game ever?
7886354	7890917	Is there a game that you can think of that would qualify as the worst video game ever?
7891218	7891778	DarkSakura.
7892338	7900624	There was a game that was so bad that when Dan and I rented it we were horrified by it and called Blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back.
7902086	7904047	And it was WCW Thunder.
7905328	7905868	That bad, huh?
7906148	7907069	It was really that bad.
7907790	7910752	And you know, I actually kind of thought the Spice Girls game was bad.
7911977	7913478	But it's so hilarious!
7913498	7916298	It was hilarious, but it was kind of hard to play.
7916879	7917799	It was awesome.
7918699	7920400	And the American Blue Stinger was bad.
7920900	7921960	The Japanese one was cool.
7922881	7923681	Worst game ever.
7923761	7924541	Alan, you got something?
7928243	7931084	Probably that King's Quest Mask of Eternity game.
7931824	7938446	Because I bought it the day it came out for full retail price, which was like 50 bucks, and it is hideously awful bad.
7939767	7940267	Terra bad?
7940387	7940907	Terra bad.
7943374	7946756	Um, I would, uh, what is the worst video game ever?
7946836	7950558	Fusion Frenzy 2 is probably the worst video game.
7950678	7950999	One of them.
7951079	7951679	It's close.
7951999	7954941	Uh, that was that one I made you play on the 360 that was so, so bad.
7955001	7957382	Like it was like Mario Party, but not fun at all.
7957402	7962425	It was like when you had me play Yaris, I couldn't help it because I was laughing.
7962565	7967428	I was just laugh, just laughter came out of me playing Yaris because it was so, what is this?
7967528	7968249	I do not even.
7968849	7970230	So that's, that's worth something.
7971889	7998084	and BitBoy was really a special kind of terrible that I played earlier this year too that was really bad or last year and going like if I want to go way back I remember renting this game on the Nintendo Entertainment System and thinking it was just like the worst fucking game I'd ever played and I bet nobody's ever even heard of it it was a Color Dreams game they made the bootleg carts it was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who and I remember this game because it was so terrible
7999205	8000806	I bet that's a game not even Jamie knows.
8000846	8002187	Like, that's how obscure this shit is.
8002207	8002387	No.
8002888	8003068	Huh?
8003448	8003948	No, I've seen it.
8004068	8004389	Have you?
8004509	8005049	It's bad, huh?
8005069	8005389	It's bad.
8005549	8006090	It's really bad.
8006850	8008311	A lot of those color dreams were really bad.
8008471	8008732	Yeah.
8009032	8009252	Yeah.
8009792	8010233	Good stuff.
8010313	8012294	Bradley, any Terra bad games you can think of?
8013155	8014335	Worst freaking video game?
8015576	8021100	The worst, a lot of them that are really terrible are like these girl fighting games on like the Japanese Saturn ones.
8021660	8024062	I don't know if it was like Asuka 120% was one of them.
8024082	8025423	That game was actually fun.
8026323	8027464	I'm thinking of one of them.
8028345	8032868	It might have been a different one from that one, but usually they're slow and crappy moves and stuff.
8034849	8037011	Other games were craptastic.
8038612	8044896	Let's see, some of our chat room saying DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Assault was another Color Dreams game that was worse.
8045516	8071910	GreenDragon says Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom The force you had to get through was a bigger pain in the ass than the Doom Dungeon Let's see Dash of Destruction, Yaris Kabuki Warriors says Amaze Satsuma was a really bad game SirDorksalot says the PS1 version of Samurai Shodown 3 was terrible There you go, those are some of the responses there from our chatroom More Facebook questions
8074688	8079290	John on Facebook also asks the best geek moment ever.
8080170	8080870	This is a good one.
8080910	8083111	The best geek moment ever.
8083171	8085492	What was your best geek moment ever?
8085532	8086412	This is kind of tricky.
8087172	8088313	Oh, mine's easy.
8089013	8092454	That's beating the dragon blindfolded in Mega Man 2.
8093795	8094635	That is pretty geeky.
8095197	8123247	and and uh doing you know doing Mario 8-1 blindfolded if if you know your rhythm it's not that hard but the dragon because and that one was also kind of precise timing too so I and I've only done it three times nice I can't do it now hell no but when when it was out yeah okay all right Alan do you have a best geek moment ever that you can think of
8124983	8125984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8144982	8147784	I thought though this year's E3 was like a close second.
8148304	8151146	My first E3 was definitely my best, but this year's E3 was a close second.
8151166	8152427	This is a really good E3 this year.
8153267	8155809	What about though going to E3 for the first time as press?
8157741	8166769	That was cool too, but I honestly didn't notice that huge of a difference because one thing I've learned about press is that if you don't book your show like six months in advance, then you're pretty much having the same show as everyone else.
8167850	8173775	Plus back in 06 or 07, I don't remember what year we actually went as press, maybe it was 07.
8174055	8177898	I booked us with Bethesda well in advance so we could get in for the Star Trek screening.
8178078	8180441	Yeah, which ended up being a mediocre game, which was too bad.
8180641	8185727	Yeah, and I got into... Though I got in one time as not as pressed, though, for a pressed thing for PabloCross.
8186147	8186888	Yeah.
8187268	8188410	I'm sorry to steal your thunder.
8188750	8189251	Oh, that's okay.
8189791	8190572	But it was good.
8191513	8194757	Yeah, there were some really good parties, depending on what year it was, you know.
8195677	8217655	uh looking in our chat room and some of the questions uh questions here uh JV Mon says my best geek moment was meeting Matt Smith at the New York City premiere of Doctor Who series 5 and being on the 13th episode of Doctor Who Confidential uh Ranma says beating Mega Man 3 Dan Shadow says the parties at E3 were insane yep yep uh what was that place that we went and got beer at
8218396	8222081	They had like 200 taps on the wall or something like that.
8222561	8223743	That place was epic.
8223843	8224404	That was Seattle.
8224424	8225686	For PAX, that was epic.
8225966	8227549	Yes, maybe some people are there right now.
8227629	8232115	Although, you know, I did enjoy my Facebook style photo with Jonathan Colton.
8232155	8232636	That was pretty fun.
8237992	8240134	I've got one, I've got one.
8240474	8242075	I just thought of one.
8243036	8244257	Anime Expo 2000.
8245658	8247339	Jamie says he remembers seeing me there.
8247380	8254025	That was my last day X. I actually stayed up all night at the DDR room.
8254405	8260450	I think I only played it once there, but I was just there watching people because I was waiting for... They were having signings in the morning.
8260470	8261991	That was the one at Disneyland, wasn't it?
8262912	8263993	Was it 2001 at Disneyland?
8264013	8265594	Because then I was there for one after that.
8265990	8269391	I can't remember if that was a Long Beach one or a Disneyland one.
8269831	8271631	No, it had to have been Long Beach.
8272131	8274352	No, 2000 was the one at Disneyland.
8274372	8275992	2001 was in Long Beach.
8276152	8277533	Yeah, it was at Anaheim.
8278073	8280193	It was one of those long piers down there.
8280233	8281773	We went down there and waited.
8282734	8288395	So yeah, basically staying up all night watching people play DDR, waiting to get signatures from artists and stuff.
8289784	8290244	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
8310973	8312094	That was the year of the chair.
8312815	8314156	Here's some more geek moments from chat.
8314196	8317418	GreenDragon says, biggest geek moment, speaking Klingon with my dad.
8317798	8318699	Dude, your dad is cool.
8319840	8320240	Let's see.
8321802	8329828	Gilroy Spars, which I think is Nathan, says, being told about a weekend cabin retreat of drinking and massive D&D playing and being very excited about going.
8329848	8330809	That does sound kind of awesome.
8331129	8331670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8349068	8355610	That pretty much means have a good year because Rosh Hashanah is this Wednesday night slash Thursday during the day.
8356771	8360492	It's like I'm the translator of Jew speak tonight or something.
8360912	8362393	It's just Hebrew, Rob.
8362793	8363793	I thought of my geek moment.
8363833	8365214	You thought of your geek moment, yay!
8366674	8369655	When I was in D-Malay, which was the youth group that I was in.
8370776	8371196	Oh boy.
8371216	8373136	Alright, I'm going to out myself.
8373256	8373917	I was in it too.
8374397	8377478	I haven't talked about it a lot on the show because not a lot of kids were in it.
8378058	8380259	Like, it's youth masonry, right?
8380319	8383240	So it's like not a lot of... The Shriners and the Masons before their son.
8383440	8388222	Usually if your grandpa's in it, or in my case, you end up being in it, or you have friends that were in it or what have you.
8388722	8395945	But the reason why I bring this up before he says this is because Alan and I were both in this organization.
8396326	8398266	So we're convinced that we met each other when we were 15.
8398306	8398987	We met each other at camp.
8399287	8401548	Like at camp, at the leadership camp or whatever.
8401948	8406890	Like we're convinced we met each other and just didn't like, you know, we weren't really...
8407762	8409664	Super Nintendo Super Nintendo Super Nintendo
8423461	8442245	At the convention, which is basically like four days of a bunch of 15-year-old boys just staying up and doing convention things, I think we hooked up a Super NES up to our hotel TV room, and we played, I think we played Rock and Roll Racing and Street Fighter II, I think for like 36 hours without sleeping.
8442605	8443545	Oh my god.
8443885	8445465	Which is something that you can only do when you're 15.
8445545	8448226	I beg to differ.
8448506	8449106	Uh-oh.
8450553	8451234	I beg to differ.
8451994	8474975	When I, it was probably my, I'd have to say my second year of college or my first year, somewhere around there, I was working in the game room and so I brought in my TV and my Super Nintendo and my friend brought in his import Saturn and we had gaming going on in the pool hall all night and I ran D&D games and we did this three nights in a row and I did not sleep and on the fourth day of having been awake,
8476075	8486281	I sit down at my friend's dorm room and lean back on the cushions while they're playing whatever I think it was Doom at the time and wake up in my own dorm bed.
8487682	8488583	Oh, so they carried you.
8488823	8489963	They carried me to my dorm room.
8490024	8490824	Don't remember any of it.
8490904	8491344	Don't remember.
8492345	8492505	But...
8494423	8503528	I'm sorry, but the best dorm slash frat house story that you possibly have was when you missed this show because you were in San Diego one weekend and you stayed at the gay frat house.
8503548	8505309	Can you tell this story again on the show real quick?
8505329	8506030	Oh, God, right.
8506090	8506850	It's been years.
8508131	8512674	I went with Julie to San Diego to see some friends of ours.
8514095	8516576	One of them lives in Japan right now and the other one lives somewhere.
8516596	8517677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8537333	8540314	Because the only place that we had to stay was the gay frat house.
8541195	8541975	To stay with our friend.
8542035	8543776	Oh, your friend was a gay frat boy.
8543916	8544156	Yeah.
8544856	8545697	He lived in the frat house.
8546197	8549638	So the only spaces, like Julie slept on, I think, on some couch.
8550179	8553880	And I slept in a little room under the stairs where there had been a mattress.
8554180	8556662	It's like the Harry Potter room.
8556682	8558222	That's what it called it, the Harry Potter room.
8559083	8562124	And it had a little light in there all on its own and everything.
8562144	8562864	It was actually kind of neat.
8563565	8566826	I'm very, very glad they washed the mattress before I used it.
8567307	8571653	I know, I was just like, think about all the handjobs that have taken place in that little closet.
8571673	8572934	Bro, I'm so drunk, bro.
8573635	8574597	Bro, where we at, bro?
8578177	8580118	I slept in the Harry Potter room, Rob!
8605431	8607312	I read Harry Potter in the Harry Potter room!
8609673	8612374	And I was like, wait, there's gay frat houses?
8612514	8614255	Like, I didn't even know they existed at that time.
8614275	8615395	There's like a national gay fraternity.
8615415	8618996	No, I know that now, but like ten years ago I didn't, or however long ago that was.
8620257	8621898	All that long time ago, oh no.
8622238	8622838	Been a long time.
8623578	8623898	Alright.
8625659	8628260	Red Entertainment is following up saying, bro, don't stop doing that.
8631901	8633082	I need to get something else to drink.
8633959	8635240	Best and Worst Game Tie-Ins
8658521	8663144	I think honestly the best as far as movies and all that go, the Silent Hill movie was pretty kickass.
8663345	8669029	Even though it wasn't perfect, it was still miles above anything else that I think has come out to this point.
8669109	8671650	So the Silent Hill movie is probably one of the best.
8672591	8673952	As far as the worst...
8675353	8676974	That Maniac Mansion shows up there.
8677294	8678095	That was pretty bad.
8678255	8682278	Or maybe the Pac-Man cartoon in the 80s was not that great either.
8682398	8685660	It really didn't work for me.
8685860	8686200	I don't know.
8686901	8689703	The best and the worst video game tie-ins, DarkSakura.
8689743	8690663	Like movie, TV.
8691344	8692184	Best was Silent Hill.
8692885	8693685	I have to agree with you there.
8694086	8697208	And you know how many times I watched it and I bought it on Blu-ray because I'm a fucking addict.
8698369	8701250	Saw it four times in the theater.
8701911	8702311	Worst...
8704338	8710121	Captain N because the characterizations in that were just so awful.
8710341	8711102	They were hideous.
8712343	8718506	And I also have to say the Street Fighter movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
8719307	8721708	Poor Raul Julia having that as his last movie.
8722749	8723729	But Kali Minow was hot.
8728698	8748850	any uh alan about uh captain n yeah you brought it up i love that show now when i think back on it why did kid icarus always suffix everything he said with icus like that was his speech impediment what was that well and megaman was always mega this mega that and simon belmont was an idiot and he was supposed to be like this courageous vampire hunter
8750458	8750718	Yeah.
8751178	8751598	IDK.
8752039	8752419	IDK.
8752759	8754099	Best video game tie-in?
8754239	8754999	Super Mario Bros.
8755019	8755400	cereal.
8757220	8758060	Because you like food.
8758381	8758601	Yeah.
8758821	8762522	I would eat all... That's funny.
8762622	8762702	No.
8763542	8767423	I would pick out all the marshmallows and then eat... Save the dry cereal for later.
8768084	8772185	The one... Whatever Nintendo cereal had the two sides, it was like two bags in one box.
8772685	8773105	Yeah, I remember.
8773125	8774226	The Nintendo breakfast system.
8774246	8775366	The Nintendo cereal system, yeah.
8775486	8775706	Yeah.
8776106	8776646	Okay, that.
8777507	8778067	Worst...
8783898	8784798	I had one, I blanked.
8785238	8785599	Uh-oh.
8785759	8786099	Tired.
8786179	8787759	Live radio.
8787799	8788500	I know, I'm yawning.
8788760	8789940	We haven't even gotten to the games yet.
8790420	8791821	We gotta get to that segment pretty soon.
8791981	8793141	Well, let me know if you think about it, okay?
8793181	8794862	Bradley, I don't know if you have anything you're thinking of?
8795782	8797162	Best and worst video game tie-ins?
8797602	8798543	Can't really think of anything.
8799763	8804365	Amy and all of the marketing related to Dante's Inferno last year.
8804385	8807546	It's the worst video game tie-ins ever.
8807826	8809626	Oh, what was so terrible about it, do I ask?
8809746	8812067	Like, see what you can get away with with a booth babe.
8813187	8820930	Or maybe tied for God of War 2 when they served a goat or something at the press conference and they had the girls in the togas.
8820970	8822210	Of course, it was a fake animal.
8822830	8825351	But they're like, oh yeah, we have a dead goat for God of War 2.
8825891	8828512	No, that's dumb and you're a bad person for thinking of it.
8830256	8833619	Yeah, Sony just, in general, has a lot of really bad tie-ins.
8833639	8837363	Like, sometimes they do really well, like the Kevin Butler stuff, but sometimes they do really bad.
8837403	8838884	Like, remember the black and white PSP?
8839065	8841287	Oh yeah, that was not good.
8841727	8843769	Like, you just feel second-hand embarrassment for them, right?
8844750	8846512	Or the PSP commercial with the squirrels.
8846972	8847192	Yes.
8848374	8848634	Alright.

9034957	9036038	Yes, very practical.
9036098	9037380	Corporate sponsorship.
9037640	9041104	Hour 19 of the OLR Marathon brought to us tonight by Cinnabon.
9046981	9047981	I like sugar!
9048061	9049943	Every now and then we have a delicious Cinnabon.
9052265	9064275	And my left arm is tingling and I don't know why, but... Who was that you were talking about once and it was like a, I don't know, it was like some really dumpy actress or something that was a total slut and you said, ah, she looks like she's been glazed up like a Cinnabon.
9064295	9065797	I don't know.
9066517	9067018	Who was that?
9067038	9068180	Were you talking about one of our friends?

9085161	9085861	Okay, here's the thing.
9086201	9086802	No, seriously.
9087082	9088982	We were in Reno and we were gambling.
9089022	9093684	We were downstairs because they have a queen slot machine, which is the most amazing invention ever made.
9093704	9094544	Like the band.
9094584	9096525	Like the band, not like, you know, hey girl.
9096885	9099906	Okay, it was a queen slot machine with Freddie Mercury, right?
9100306	9104848	But Alan and I went upstairs because Alan was kind of sick and I wanted to set some stuff down.
9105128	9106188	We're like, we'll be right back.
9106628	9110250	We get back downstairs and my friend's gone.

9146963	9147923	Yeah!
9148464	9149704	Bastard!
9150085	9152486	I thought we would need him to get through the show.
9152546	9153487	We haven't needed him.
9154307	9156849	I'm very proud that we've gotten through this all by our lonesome selves.
9157049	9157950	Relatively Dan-free.
9158150	9158570	Pretty nice.
9159250	9161052	Alright.

9162292	9162793	Next up.

9164974	9165875	A laser light show.
9166595	9167776	A laser light show.
9167816	9168797	I could do a light switch rave.
9168837	9169257	Will that help?
9171129	9173009	I don't know how that translates to radio.
9174630	9175570	Who cares about the listeners?
9175610	9177370	That's right, who cares about the listeners?
9181271	9187152	We put on Pink Floyd's The Wall and it's like... Oh, it just all makes sense now.
9187292	9190553	Like, when I watch The Wizard of Oz, it has a whole new meaning.
9190573	9196334	Alright, um... Alan, your number two pick for thing you most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011?
9196534	9200795	A live web stream of booty poppin' go-go dancers in 8-bit cosplay.
9203825	9205467	Slow that down and say it one more time.
9206107	9212233	A live web stream of accompanying go-go dancing people in 8-bit cosplay.
9214836	9215817	Any particular reason why?
9216597	9220882	Because we've been doing this for 10 hours and I'm delirious right now.
9221122	9221482	All right.
9221522	9222883	My ideas are going to be kind of whack.
9222984	9223204	All right.
9223244	9224265	Hey, that's all right.
9224737	9227698	My number two answer is somewhat similar, actually.
9227758	9230500	Thing I most want to see on the OLR Marathon 2011?
9231360	9231960	Nudity!
9233281	9233981	But not from the hosts.
9235482	9240004	So the thing I most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011 is nudity, but not from the hosts.
9241665	9242625	We should hire a stripper.
9244546	9246287	For the next... Oh, I should have put that down.
9249599	9250880	DarkSakura, what is your number one answer?
9250900	9251500	Showgirls Edition
9279192	9280513	How does Showgirls Edition work?
9280573	9281493	You are a whore, darling.
9282874	9287157	The whole thing is just us answering questions in Showgirls quotes.
9287837	9288158	Oh, okay.
9288518	9291039	And with a topless dance show.
9292000	9293861	Hey, you're stealing my answer.
9293881	9294782	Gaming ain't fucking.
9295202	9295522	Alright.
9301246	9305028	So many of our listeners have never seen Showgirls and can't appreciate the humor of that line.
9306644	9317899	Episode 380 of Orange Lounge Radio Gaming ain't fucking Bradley, what is your number one answer for thing you most want to see of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon 2011?

9326141	9328082	Big money, big prizes.
9328222	9330722	I don't know where that money's going to come from, but okay.
9330882	9332182	Hey, it's our dream world.
9333263	9338544	Alan, your number one answer for the thing you most want to see in the OLR Marathon 2011.
9339524	9344765	No one is allowed to switch to their next story or segment until they can beat the next level of Battletoads.
9348306	9350366	Lots of dead air on that marathon.
9355073	9358154	No one is allowed to switch story until Beat Battletoads level.
9358334	9358634	I don't know.
9358674	9359775	I just had to shorten it somehow.
9360515	9364056	That's going to be very tricky, and there'll be a lot of cursing, actually.
9364096	9364796	That's going to be tough.
9365176	9365457	All right.
9366237	9369638	My number one answer for thing I most want to see at the OLR Marathon 2011.
9371018	9376180	Gabe and Tycho show up and exclaim, this is where the real party's at, bitches.
9377541	9378041	All right.
9378061	9378981	How do you like that, huh?
9380241	9381842	This joke's on Penny Arcade Expo.
9385808	9386828	Alright, so there it is.

9410677	9411457	They have to say bitches.
9412898	9416099	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9416219	9417560	One of them is about to be eliminated.
9417620	9418820	The chatters cannot vote on that.
9419161	9421302	Actually, let me read quickly while you think about that.
9421362	9425624	I want to actually read some of the suggestions from chat because they have some good ones once in a while.
9427365	9428325	I'm getting private tells.
9428705	9430326	Let me on and I will strip for the show.
9432167	9432707	Let's see.
9434868	9436489	Showgirls is an amazing movie.
9437830	9438450	Let's see.
9438870	9440371	Took you this long to get to the stripper?
9441652	9443032	Laser, Lady Gaga.
9443553	9445133	Lady Gaga would be awesome.
9445634	9447315	OLR, the musical episode.
9447875	9448415	LARPing.
9448756	9449896	Put LARPing on the list.
9449936	9451557	We could do LARPing the whole episode.
9452638	9457480	Loki reads every line ever used by Tingle in all the Zelda games, including Japanese and Tingle's voice.
9459061	9459822	Let's see.
9460582	9461623	Can I just go ahead and pick something?
9461703	9462123	Yeah, all right.
9462143	9463484	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
9464584	9464824	Nudity.
9464845	9465045	Nudity.
9466772	9467352	Nudity?
9467513	9468934	How could you eliminate nudity?
9469214	9471095	Because we can just get that on the internet anyway.
9471356	9471896	I guess that's true.
9472236	9474418	Alright, nudity is stricken from the list.
9474858	9476960	Bradley, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9477661	9478762	Corporate sponsorship.
9479062	9482064	You'd never... Alright, why?
9482685	9485847	Because it just wouldn't be LLR without sponsorship.
9486007	9486968	That's true, that's true.
9487008	9488609	If we sell out, it's just not the same.
9488790	9490051	Alright, I'll support you on that.
9490831	9492032	It is stricken from the list.
9492272	9493994	Alan, which of these is not worthy from the list?
9497479	9523432	um Gabe and Tycho show up why are you my entire list just got eliminated fuck all of you seriously no I'll pick another one no if that's the one you feel should be eliminated then we should eliminate it it's fine it's fine I'm just your boyfriend and you know you want to just ruin my day that's fine no I'm fine with it it's fine let's just see where we are at 8 o'clock tomorrow um Danathon Danathon

9526889	9527070	Uh-oh.
9527150	9527431	Okay.
9529158	9530362	Why'd you eliminate the Dan-a-thon?
9531636	9532356	Thanks for watching!
9554287	9555068	I'm going to take off.
9555168	9555968	I'm sorry, Jamie.
9556028	9558910	I love this answer, but showgirls edition just isn't going to work for me.
9558970	9559431	I'm sorry.
9559831	9560992	Darling, you are a whore.
9561192	9562113	You're a whore, darling.
9562213	9562453	All right.
9563314	9564434	It is stricken from the list.
9564715	9565415	You don't know me.
9565435	9566496	All right.
9566536	9570138	So that leaves actually playing games on video.
9570979	9584653	Balloon Drop, Loki Sings Hours of Disco, Laser Light Show, Livestream of GoGoDancing and 8-Bit Cosplay, Big Money, Big Prizes, No One is Allowed to Switch Stories Until Battletoads is Beaten, and Gabe and Tycho Show Up.
9585253	9593642	Alright, so you're going to place a vote over Private Message to Sky in the chatroom with your number one and number two answers, and then we'll tally them all up.
9593962	9594902	I gotta type this out.
9595342	9598863	And then we will tell you what won.
9598943	9599623	Not our favorites.
9599663	9600043	It doesn't matter.
9600063	9601144	It's not in our hands anymore.
9601164	9602804	It's in the hands of the listeners.
9602884	9603324	The voters.
9603944	9604364	There you go.
9605565	9607085	We need to do match game very soon.
9608625	9608965	You know.
9611246	9614967	Because if we don't, Happy Bunny will be sad.
9616307	9616607	Alright.
9617864	9618384	There you go.
9619464	9621965	Now we have to fill time while I wait for votes to come in.
9622005	9622845	How are we going to do that?
9623906	9627106	Usually I'd be doing, I don't know, like freaking phone calls or something.
9627126	9628027	Should I open up the skyline?
9628107	9628707	Open up the skyline.
9630067	9630447	Why not?
9630527	9630867	Do it.
9631147	9631828	It's almost midnight.
9632788	9634928	Just want to point out, we're almost to our 10th hour of doing this.
9636329	9636929	I'm getting crazy.
9638371	9642595	Alan, did you realize what you were signing up for when you were like, sure, Rob, I'll come be on the marathon show with you?
9642916	9643296	That's good.
9643496	9643917	You having fun?
9644037	9644217	Yeah.
9644777	9644938	Good.
9645058	9645678	I'm glad you're having fun.
9645979	9646940	I'm glad somebody's having fun.
9647460	9648221	All right.
9648241	9648641	Just kidding.
9649062	9649342	All right.
9649382	9651404	We open up the Skype line and see if we get any calls.
9652385	9656169	You're going to have to talk to whoever calls in, though, because I've got to tally up the votes.
9656189	9659892	So 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9660373	9662155	We are open to take some more calls here.
9662782	9663942	We could play silly YouTubes.
9664022	9665143	Did we get a call in?
9665163	9666303	We got a call, yes.
9666363	9667504	Okay, DarkSakura's gonna take this one.
9668084	9669584	Ghostbusters, what do you want?
9671085	9672485	Hey, it's Sterlok.
9672906	9673366	Hi.
9673986	9674306	Hello.
9674646	9675206	How are you?
9675947	9676467	I am good.
9678167	9678928	What is going on?
9679528	9683489	Besides being delirious from being up for ten hours straight.
9684050	9685290	I'm not the delirious one.
9685330	9686250	Rob's delirious.
9687051	9690792	Because Rob is Mr. Sleep Deprivation Party Pooper.
9691726	9694977	He hasn't been intaking much alcohol, has he?
9695298	9698247	He has had two entire drinks.
9699934	9703455	He hasn't even had the Guinness that I accidentally saved for him.
9705715	9708136	But I've been making delicious beverages all night.
9708336	9714757	I made one out of Patron and Grapefruit Juice, which was entirely very tasty.
9715317	9715577	Nice.
9715917	9718998	And then Patron and Orange Juice, and then Brandy and Apple Juice.
9721119	9721959	And it tastes like pie, doesn't it?
9721979	9722719	That all sounds very delicious.
9723659	9724259	Alan had some.
9724439	9725119	He had lots of it.
9725219	9725640	That was good.
9726840	9727320	It's like pie.
9727420	9729281	It's actually part of how I make my apple pie drink.
9729721	9736022	Except when I make the apple pie drink, I let it sit for like a couple of weeks and throw in some cinnamon and spices and it's pretty good.
9736963	9737303	Cool.
9739723	9740403	Awesome.
9740724	9742384	Do you have a question for us?
9743984	9744705	I don't care what it is.
9744725	9745525	Just ask something.
9745545	9747565	I don't know.
9747605	9750026	I've been eagerly awaiting questions.
9751089	9754812	The new Pokemans in two weeks.
9755693	9757695	Yes, I'm a big enough nerd.
9758775	9762679	I am importing and very excited.
9763079	9764861	Oh no, your Pokemans let you show me them.
9765561	9767703	Yes, I hear you like Mudkips.
9769845	9774829	I just thought it was funny at Faname someone cosplayed as a Mudkip.
9776937	9778559	I'm not surprised.
9779000	9783305	Of course, that was also the same year that someone cosplayed as a Wiimote.
9785147	9785868	Which is pretty funny.
9787590	9788851	The Wii, yeah.
9789813	9790173	Wee!
9790333	9790594	Wee!
9790754	9793075	Did the little pig cry wee wee wee all the way home?
9795077	9795337	Yeah.
9796718	9800200	Yeah, we're getting towards the... We've been doing what?
9800480	9801321	For how long?
9802101	9804883	What?
9804963	9810127	I really think this should be an annual event.
9811968	9812648	I'm having fun.
9812688	9813109	I would pay to...
9815939	9819841	I would pay to see it I've got a PayPal account if you want to contribute
9837290	9839651	Oh, no.
9839911	9842012	Oh, we'd only be up against DragonCon.
9842032	9843112	Yeah, no, I know.
9843713	9844173	Oh, well.
9845153	9845553	Exactly.
9845893	9846194	Oh, well.
9846254	9846774	Sorry, Bobby.
9847334	9849455	A bunch of my friends are DragonCon right now, anyway.
9850375	9853296	They're not doing that.
9853336	9853817	Yes, hi.
9854557	9858198	I also have a statement for you as well.
9858438	9858719	Uh-oh.
9860739	9862380	Uh-oh.
9866529	9867529	Look at what you've done.
9868010	9871890	Look at what you've done.
9872731	9873691	I love this app.
9874271	9875971	Which one do you have?
9876091	9876971	You know what's awesome, though?
9876991	9878612	Because I have a button in front of me, too.
9878652	9879572	You know what my button does?
9883013	9884713	No, no, not that button.
9884733	9886133	Do you know what my button does to us?
9886253	9887473	Wait, wait, wait.
9887493	9888174	Jamie, Jamie.
9888474	9888714	What?
9889154	9890534	One, two, three.
9894861	9897666	This is the stupidest marathon in the history of the internet.
9897806	9900931	Okay, wait, Sterlok, you want to know what my button does?
9900951	9902073	What does your button do?
9902594	9903475	It hangs up on callers.
9903535	9909064	You're such a... Rob, you... Alright, dirty, dirty ho bag.
9910971	9912513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9933012	9934033	Why are we still getting calls?
9934093	9935815	I want to get to the answer.
9937156	9938177	Why are people calling?
9938377	9939558	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9939578	9940159	I mean, hi.
9940419	9941460	We're so happy to have you.
9941500	9942021	Who is this?
9943722	9944243	Hello, Rob.
9944263	9945003	What's up, gang?
9945524	9945844	Hi.
9945924	9946345	Who's this?
9947906	9948787	This is Scared, though.
9948807	9949728	What are you doing?
9950068	9951009	Hey, what's up?
9951189	9951810	How are you doing?
9956775	9957115	Hello?
9957135	9957235	Hello?
9961289	9962189	Can you hear me?
9962530	9963090	Barely.
9963170	9963650	What's up?
9963690	9964351	Hey, guys.
9964591	9965351	What's up, dude?
9965511	9965891	Nothing.
9965951	9967132	I'm at Walmart, man.
9967192	9972194	I'm at Walmart just doing some shopping, and I'm listening to you guys for my shitty all-games app radio.
9973475	9974976	Hold on, hold on.
9975036	9976256	I thought I'd give you guys a call.
9977057	9982559	Don't criticize the app because it was done, I think, at a very low cost, if not for free.
9983340	9984780	So we love that app.
9985441	9988162	If it doesn't work, it's usually the Internet's fault.
9990527	9993809	I've been listening to you guys since about 2pm I'm sorry
10007557	10008258	I need some preparation, eh?
10008298	10008338	Uh...
10035987	10037928	Needs some hemorrhoid pads.
10039109	10043691	Or maybe I need some Propel because I know back in the day Jamie loved Propel.
10044491	10047193	Propel has been replaced by Vitamin Water Zero.
10047553	10049074	I love Vitamin Water Zero.
10049834	10050895	Go get some Barbies.
10057188	10058668	I'm in the blue jean section right now.
10058768	10059108	Are you?
10061789	10062229	Awesome.
10062569	10064189	Well, have fun at Walmart.
10064269	10065290	I'm glad you're still listening.
10065330	10068390	I love the fact that you're listening on the go on the handy dandy app.
10068430	10069170	That's hilarious.
10070351	10071851	We'll see how much longer we can go.
10072111	10072951	Really appreciate it.
10073431	10076652	And I hope they're not sold out of preparation.
10077072	10077512	Take care, buddy.
10077532	10079433	I'm going to let you go because our connection is kind of wonky.
10079553	10080413	But you have a good one, okay?
10081013	10081933	Okay, okay.
10081993	10082634	Later.
10083914	10086355	He was really, like, cutty and out.
10087255	10088936	So I had to cut that one short.
10088956	10089436	I'm sorry.
10089596	10090336	I'm sorry, caller.
10090936	10092137	It's nothing personal, I swear.
10092677	10092917	Okay.
10093597	10096458	So, 1877 GameOLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10096478	10098239	You think everybody would stop listening by now?
10098279	10101800	Like, usually during the normal show, everybody's tuned out by the time the afterbirth starts.
10101840	10102480	Nobody cares anymore.
10102500	10104721	But, nope, tonight, almost midnight, still going.
10107442	10108642	Hi, on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10110174	10114977	Oh man, Legend of Zaku again Zaku again What's on your mind?
10116538	10139490	Nah, just like watching paint dry, in other words watching my hard drive format for the past four hours And listening to this show, yeah, I know Yeah, I know But yeah, I guess, I don't know if you mentioned any Bomani related stuff like, um, hold on I'll put John's picture I mean, that's supposed to be location testing in New Jersey now
10139741	10141022	Wait, take us off speakerphone.
10141042	10141623	This sucks.
10143044	10143744	Oh, come on.
10144205	10144785	It sucks.
10145466	10145946	I hate it.
10147027	10148468	Rob's got a wedgie right now.
10148488	10150250	I do not consent to speakerphone.
10151571	10152071	Alright.
10152272	10152532	Alright.
10154894	10155134	Alright.
10155414	10158136	DDR, it came up on the show a couple weeks ago.
10158577	10162220	Somebody went to the LA premiere and we, I don't know, somebody was talking about it.
10162260	10168125	I guess the pads are better and the interface is pretty, but otherwise, hey, it's still DDR.
10169943	10177607	Well, that and they started unlocking songs now, so we're getting a lot of, like, crossover, a lot of B-Mani crossovers, like, pull it up.
10177627	10190774	I know it was, like, as early as a few days ago, they had some, they had, like, I forgot what songs they had, but I know some of them, like, ah, here we go.
10192135	10197738	They unlocked, uh, there's Vanessa's from 2DX15 that was unlocked.
10199596	10228839	other songs so like songs from a series I stopped following four years ago basically pretty no yeah around that pretty no what is a pretty no is that like a pink you know tending to my girlfriend and other things in life I mean I do play but not as much as I used to and that's due to age like I'm getting old I'm getting pretty old now
10229864	10232148	New York City scene is on its way out.
10232168	10234191	Kind of almost dead at this point.
10234772	10236195	Someone goes to New Jersey now.
10236536	10237557	You got a girlfriend now?
10238960	10241324	Yeah, I've been in a relationship since April.
10241484	10242245	Oh my gosh.
10242486	10243728	How often does she have to be inflated?
10244264	10245745	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
10245785	10247146	Oh, I had to.
10247166	10248187	You have my permission.
10249548	10251450	You have my permission to call Rob a hoobag.
10253332	10254633	I'm kidding, come on.
10255073	10256294	What's a little, come on.
10256334	10258856	I gotta give the listeners some crap once in a while.
10259337	10259657	Alright.
10262179	10263901	But okay, so the New York scene is dying.
10263941	10264561	I'm sorry to hear that.
10264581	10267724	But hey, at least you're getting laid so all's good with the world, right?
10269145	10270446	Pretty much, I mean, you know.
10270506	10272528	As I said, DDR is like
10273314	10276535	It's not as big as it used to be here, but whatever.
10276575	10277716	We still play somewhat.
10277776	10281197	I try to avoid CF like the plague at home in New York.
10282378	10288000	Coney Island scene is pretty much a wasteland at this point.
10288801	10294123	I hate to say it, but everyone's going out to either deep parts of Queens or New Jersey to play.
10294223	10296624	Wasn't Coney Island supposed to be getting this huge makeover?
10296924	10299165	Like now or something?
10299245	10301706	Even then, Luna Park doesn't have arcades.
10302610	10330230	that's a problem all the other arcades they used to be an arcade they used to have DDR but it burned down this past year so I don't know whether they'll have DDR when they rebuild all the other places are pretty much the same I mean it's like I can't think of any good places to play now even the one that we had in Queens basically the mall kicked them out so they got sent further into Long Island
10331930	10333471	I know, it's bullshit now.
10333791	10343074	I usually go out to, like, Bayside, you know, to Peter Pan Games to play, you know, 2DX, and now we have Poppin' 17.
10344034	10347855	Yes, we got the latest version of Poppin' in New York.
10350136	10352357	I don't know why, but that just came up recently.
10353010	10355472	I know, I'm just trying to keep this show going with this.
10355812	10357053	No, it's all good.
10357614	10359015	I appreciate your dedication.
10359035	10361577	But we're going to let you go real quick because we have a special announcement to make, okay?
10363081	10365103	Alright, make sure to go to 2pm.
10366804	10367244	Yeah, right.
10367284	10368305	Alright, take care, buddy.
10368445	10368725	Bye.
10370286	10372328	Ladies and gentlemen, we have made it to midnight.
10372408	10374710	It is now midnight.
10374850	10383937	The goal was to make it for 10 hours and we have successfully been broadcasting at Lovely All Games Radio for 10 hours and this is the point where we would call it off, but...
10385130	10385751	Let's keep going.
10385791	10386271	Let's keep going.
10386492	10387372	We got another hour.
10387432	10388093	Let's keep going.
10388113	10389034	We got another hour in this.
10389074	10389655	Let's keep going.
10389675	10390515	Let's do it.
10391156	10391456	Let's do it.
10391476	10391897	Let's do it.
10392177	10394099	And then we were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.
10394239	10394719	Yay.
10394819	10395059	All right.
10395080	10398262	Well, did you see the screen was lit up with calls?
10398282	10398843	Did you see that?
10399063	10399343	I did.
10399824	10400404	Oh my gosh.
10400444	10400665	All right.
10400685	10401766	So we'll try to get a couple more calls.
10402006	10404688	How about listless results real fast though before I go back to the phones?
10404728	10405489	Listless results.
10405629	10406330	Listless results.
10406450	10406990	I'm hurrying.
10408979	10412885	The definitive list of the things you most want to see in the OLR marathon 2011.
10412985	10414567	Oops, I never counted.
10416329	10418052	You are such a dork.
10418072	10419494	There's two leaders, clearly.
10423339	10424200	21 votes for that one.
10447071	10447311	Alright.
10447792	10449133	Well then just read them, shit.
10449173	10449653	Fine, here it is.
10450074	10455759	Tied for number three, the most definitive things you want to see on the OLR Marathon 2011.
10456319	10457820	A laser light show!
10458521	10459302	Yay!
10459522	10462284	I love how the radio listeners voted for a laser light show.
10463625	10467669	Gabe and Tycho show up and say, this is where the real party's at, bitches!
10468229	10469631	Yay!
10469771	10473434	Although they won't have to now, because PAX got moved a week back, so they really could do that.
10474154	10474234	Uh...
10474975	10476736	The number two definitive answer.
10476796	10477777	This is it.
10478097	10481259	Once we're past this, guys, this is the definitive list.
10481279	10482220	There's no arguing.
10483160	10483881	Just read it already.
10484101	10484541	Okay, fine.
10484981	10487443	Livestream of GoGoDancing in 8-bit cosplay.
10487563	10488784	Yay!
10489918	10492640	And the number one answer is a tie.
10493141	10494943	It's a tie.
10495383	10495743	All right.
10495863	10496504	Read it.
10497205	10499386	Actually playing games on video.
10499547	10501228	Yay.
10501889	10503290	And these are landslide.
10503910	10507213	Loki sings hours and hours of disco.
10508254	10509375	At the car wash.
10512638	10513058	There you go.
10513098	10515740	I brought a bunch of PSP and DS games that are still in the car.
10516121	10516341	Did you?
10516361	10517802	Because I didn't know what we were going to do today.
10518282	10518803	I didn't either.
10520384	10521004	I just showed up.
10521024	10521765	They're still in the car.
10523046	10524326	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10524367	10524767	Who's this?
10526048	10526568	Hey, hello?
10526888	10527249	Hello.
10528269	10529971	Hey, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
10530111	10531772	DDR Dollar Bill, what's up?
10531792	10532492	$50 bill.
10535305	10535986	Nothing much.
10536206	10539328	It's like 3am and I'm half a loopy, so... Oh!
10539829	10540489	Join the club.
10540549	10541990	You'll be a perfect fit for our show.
10542030	10542791	What's on your mind, buddy?
10544032	10544532	Not much.
10544793	10545894	I was on the call earlier.
10545914	10551758	I think Sakura said about going older and not playing games as much and DDR just fading out.
10553600	10554901	Man, I agree with that.
10554981	10561566	I mean, there's next to no place to play DR anymore and even I stopped playing and I didn't get bored of it.
10561586	10563768	I just got tired of all these new kids coming around and causing...
10564690	10565491	Thanks for watching!
10585251	10591595	There's Dance Central for those folks that really want something in the mainstream and like their music to be in the mainstream and top 40.
10592256	10597039	And then for folks that have really grown up on the Bomani hits from Japan, there's Dance Masters.
10597379	10601422	I really think there's something for everyone on Kinect, and it's kind of exciting where that's going.
10601442	10603883	And it almost makes me excited about music games again.
10604223	10605444	Is that game DDR?
10606225	10608326	No, but DDR's been around since 1998.
10608366	10608466	It's...
10611548	10613268	It's been an epically long series.
10613549	10615829	It's okay for it to be dying out right about now, you know?
10617029	10618030	I'm not disagreeing with that.
10618750	10621611	I don't mind it dying out because it's been around forever.
10621651	10634534	But my only thing with the two dance games that I was thinking about when I actually saw it was, both of them, I would actually like to see something where you can make your own choreography, not just follow what they have on screen.
10635634	10638455	Like everything seems to be set to, so you pick one song,
10638956	10641716	You follow that choreography for that song and it never changes.
10642997	10648778	And I kind of want to see, because they have, it's the way it looks like is that they're broken to sections.
10648818	10653319	So you have a four beat for one step, maybe two beats for another step.
10653339	10658519	You know, you kind of like put it together the way it looks in the commercials.
10658719	10666941	And the way I'm thinking is, if there's some way maybe to shuffle something around so you can kind of make your own choreography to the song, your own version to it.
10667041	10667281	Mm-hmm.
10668254	10680181	I mean, that's one way I was thinking it would actually make the game look better, because otherwise, I mean, I could see it being good, but at the same time, I don't know, it just seems kind of too limited.
10680361	10684063	I honestly, honestly think that Dance Masters is the future of DDR.
10684223	10687485	Like, I think that's where Konami's putting their stock, is this whole Kinect thing.
10687625	10690327	And if it takes off, you're going to see something like it in arcades, too.
10691648	10692568	Man, I hope so.
10692648	10694490	I mean, if they fix the lag in the Kinect...
10695768	10698710	Yeah, this will definitely take off like crazy.
10698750	10700912	And I can even see dance schools utilizing this.
10701172	10701652	We'll see.
10701993	10702213	All right.
10702493	10703974	Buddy, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.
10704154	10705315	But thanks so much for the call, okay?
10705976	10706676	I'll get some coffee.
10706716	10707056	See you later.
10707076	10707297	All right.
10707337	10707797	Good luck.
10709698	10709918	All right.
10709938	10711660	We'll try and get some more calls in.
10711680	10714082	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
10714102	10716003	We still have one more game we want to play before the night's over.
10716643	10720927	And we'll probably do that in the last segment here after another break.
10722007	10725050	I'm trying to at least get a couple more calls in if there's still people interested in calling.
10725070	10728533	So we'll give it a couple more minutes.
10728933	10730555	Hi, you're on the OLR-a-thon.
10730615	10730955	Who's this?
10731816	10732376	It's Misty.
10732576	10733197	Hi, Misty.
10733237	10733777	How are you?
10734478	10735058	I'm doing good.
10735859	10736159	Awesome.
10736540	10737520	The Walmart thing, though?
10738141	10738661	Yeah?
10739762	10744266	In the middle of the night, it's called I Closed and I Need Some DVDs to Burn Shit To.
10745487	10745847	I see.
10746148	10747929	Are you actually close to Walmart where you are?
10747949	10748830	Whoa.
10749692	10752038	I got a ride home that night, but still.
10752319	10752620	I see.
10753723	10754305	Alright, well.
10755192	10758034	Sometimes you need to make the emergency Walmart run, I suppose.
10758114	10758955	Although, I don't know.
10759115	10761637	I wish they had 24-hour targets.
10761697	10765520	And yes, I realize I'm supposed to be boycotting Target, apparently.
10765620	10766641	But I can't.
10767681	10768922	They're less evil than Walmart.
10769163	10771064	Yes, it's the lesser of two evils.
10771144	10771484	Still.
10772085	10775087	They could donate another $150,000 to whatever organization.
10775147	10777088	It still is less evil than Walmart in my book.
10777108	10779030	But I'm a hippie like that.
10779090	10779390	Whatever.
10779410	10780371	Yeah.
10781451	10784393	Well, what about games and stuff?
10784453	10786234	Any game-y related things you want to share?
10786274	10787154	Things you've been playing lately?
10788455	10791817	I've been working on some Green Day Rock Band on during the show, admittedly.
10791997	10792498	How is that?
10793899	10794339	I like it.
10794559	10798741	It turns out that I like more Green Day stuff than I thought I originally would.
10798761	10801103	Because I never got to play it back in the day.
10801724	10809246	Have you ever done that when you get one of those type of band packs or band games or whatever, you're kind of like, oh, I didn't realize they sang that song.
10809866	10816788	Because I've kind of had that happen, like buying Greatest Hits CDs, you know, you're listening to it and you're like, oh, this band did that song too?
10816888	10818068	And I never realized that.
10818868	10819849	Do you kind of have that going on?
10820309	10826690	For rock band DLC, it's been more, I got, I sheaped into buying some DLC and it's like, oh, this ain't bad.
10826710	10827251	Nice.
10828391	10828631	Nice.
10830362	10837830	Alright, well, Misty, we'll let you get back to some Green Day Rock Band so we can take some more calls, but enjoy your future trips to Walmart and enjoy Green Day Rock Band, okay?
10838590	10839191	Okay, thanks.
10839251	10839712	Alright, later.
10839732	10843415	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10843796	10844476	Hi, you're on the show.
10844516	10844857	Who's this?
10845778	10846899	Hi, it's Tiara.
10846999	10847820	Hi, Tiara.
10847860	10848600	What's on your mind?
10848620	10848661	Hi.
10850329	10853051	I just wanted to call in and say that you are complaining.
10853091	10855853	Well, you're not really complaining about how long you've been doing the show.
10855873	10856733	You're kind of bragging.
10856794	10860596	But I've been doing this since 11 o'clock this morning, and so has DarkSakura.
10860616	10863638	So I think both of us kind of beat out the rest of you.
10864058	10864819	Oh, you women.
10865379	10867561	You always have to assert your dominance over the rest of us.
10867601	10868061	No, I'm kidding.
10868361	10870543	No, I think DarkSakura is crazy.
10870603	10876787	Like when she told me that she was doing a podcast, she's like, oh, yeah, 2 o'clock is fine because I've got to get up to do another podcast at 11.
10876827	10878748	I'm like, and then you're going to do a 10-hour show?
10878948	10879689	You're crazy.
10881069	10885010	She just told me that she wanted to do a 12-hour show and be up until 2.
10885270	10887831	I was like, well, you've already done 12 hours.
10887911	10888451	It's okay.
10888471	10889271	You don't have to do that.
10889291	10889611	It's true.
10889651	10891632	You're on hour 13 if you think about it.
10891652	10892632	Yeah, I know.
10892692	10895153	It's like, come on, guys.
10895193	10895913	Let's wrap it up.
10896033	10897473	I want to go to sleep, all right?
10897933	10898513	I'm trying.
10898753	10900954	The phones will not stop ringing.
10901354	10903275	We're still at, what, over 100 listeners right now?
10903716	10904256	Uh, not quite.
10904276	10904696	Oh, okay.
10904796	10906577	But, I mean, for internet radio, we're sitting pretty.
10906617	10907498	You guys are really popular tonight.
10907778	10908459	It's crazy.
10908699	10912921	Well, a lot of old listeners, for some reason, have decided to come back tonight to hear the marathon.
10912941	10913622	So, it's great.
10914022	10916204	Hey, any stunt to get ratings?
10916284	10917104	Hey!
10917304	10923268	And you know, my companion, Rob Kidman, the doctor-ish guy, he's listening now.
10923348	10928091	He's actually, he went to sleep before the show started, or maybe right after the show started.
10928531	10930373	And now he's awake again, and he said he's listening.
10930433	10930913	So, hi, Rob!
10930933	10931293	Rob!
10931414	10931894	Well, hello!
10931914	10932315	Hello!
10932355	10933116	Hello, Chop!
10933617	10934197	He should call.
10934478	10939644	Well, if he doesn't have Skype, he can't, because overseas it's really hard to call the 800 number.
10939664	10940465	It's not really toll-free.
10940486	10944150	Yeah, I'm not sure if he has Skype or not, so if he does, then he should call.
10944170	10945072	He should get on that.
10947151	10968742	but yeah, I just wanted to call and tell you guys wrap it up, I'm getting tired we're trying, we still got a match game to do we're gonna try and get through that, okay alright, take care, Tiara kisses, kisses Tron, Tron in December yes, Tron goodbye, Tron Alan, you look like you're actually falling asleep over there, are you doing alright?
10969833	10970313	Are you okay?
10970553	10971514	More booze!
10971574	10973814	Are you okay if we do match game or do we need to wrap this shit up?
10973934	10974615	Because we've made it.
10974815	10975835	We promised midnight.
10975875	10976775	We made it to midnight.
10977196	10978376	We don't owe him anything else.
10978636	10982618	We can pull the plug whenever we want, guilt free, okay?
10983138	10984158	Just putting that out there.
10985499	10989260	You watch out because then I'll start doing a return of my old show.

11074991	11078753	you have to have the computer room are there any dice with more than 6 sides there?
11080223	11081084	I think so, yeah.

11082624	11087947	We have Descent, we have Settlers of Catan, we got a lot of board game stuff.
11088147	11088867	I see, I see.
11089228	11090368	Playing all the classic nerds.
11090548	11093470	I actually sent a couple pictures to a mailbag.
11093930	11094450	Oh, you did?
11094710	11096511	Oh, DarkSakura should open that mailbag at some point.
11096531	11097112	Was that from you?
11097492	11097712	Yes.
11098652	11101254	Oh, well then let me... She probably thought it was spam.
11101314	11104435	I didn't delete it, I didn't delete it, so let me pull it back up.
11104816	11105796	Okay.

11110019	11110359	Good time.
11110379	11116521	Well, what are some of the epic battles that have taken place at the beach house where you guys stay indoors and play games all day and don't go to the beach?
11117681	11131866	Well, we all got StarCraft II hooked up, so we've been doing, you know, we have about, let's see, we've got about ten computers there, like four desktops and the rest laptops.
11132227	11134047	Who's winning, Terran, Protoss, or Zerg?
11134447	11135528	Holy crap, a Nintendo 64.

11161183	11161684	Oh, wow.

11163726	11163966	Dear...

11169344	11169724	What's that?
11169744	11172145	They took away the lane battles.
11173065	11174806	Yeah, you have to do it through Battle.net now.
11175006	11175586	It's crazy.
11175826	11176346	I don't know why.
11176486	11183248	Which is horrible because we've got like 10 people playing and it's constantly lagging on a shared connection.
11185749	11189791	And we've got it wired connected through a switch.
11190431	11190771	So...
11191832	11194373	But of course, there's so many of you on it, it's lagging, of course.
11194973	11196113	Look at all those nerds.
11196633	11200914	Is that you posing at the end of the laptop table?
11200934	11201494	No, that's not him.

11207596	11211797	All right, we're going to let you go, SJ100Matt, so we can take one more break and hopefully wrap things up in the next segment.
11211817	11212197	Okay, buddy?
11213237	11213917	All right, cool.

11241017	11242438	We've got to go to another break.
11242458	11243898	We'll read the email when we get back from break.
11244238	11245499	Will we have time for match game?
11245659	11246019	I don't know.

11411501	11413443	And I'm from the lovely Las Vegas.
11414684	11424494	And any games and TV shows about Las Vegas, they're usually about my life, but I have to kind of moderate them and tell them not to tell all of my secrets at once.
11424834	11425054	Mm-hmm.
11425975	11427516	And what do you do?
11427596	11429458	So since you live in Vegas, what do you do for a living?

11436923	11437603	And what's the other?
11438243	11442786	Well, I shouldn't say, but I think you know the answer.

11728596	11730837	If I let him go to the raid, he'll scream like a girl.
11730877	11733037	I don't know if that's incentive, but okay.
11735117	11736578	I was just thinking of a different answer.

12129490	12131991	Bradley, I know how I'll make the money.
12132511	12134232	I'll sell all my... Blood.
12134352	12135392	He's just that serious.
12139284	12141706	It's not the answer, but it's the way he said it.
12141986	12144028	Like, this is serious business.
12144529	12146410	Blood, this is serious business.
12150634	12151014	Alright.
12152355	12154697	Alan, I know how I'll make the money.
12155198	12157039	I'll sell all my... Battered hilts.
12157459	12158540	Battered hilts.
12160925	12161825	Warcraft joke.
12161905	12162685	I see what you did there.
12162705	12163166	Good job.
12163186	12163526	Good job.
12163886	12164206	All right.
12165466	12168007	And here it is, and I think this is an appropriate final answer.
12168687	12171248	I know how I'll make the money, Rob thought to himself.
12171928	12174348	I'll sell all my dignity.
12175328	12176689	Yay!
12179549	12181250	Sorry, not a match.
12182785	12183365	Aw.
12183405	12185666	Let's tally it up.
12186307	12188507	Just like the Jerry Lewis telethon.
12188527	12190448	Oh yeah, that's going on, isn't it?
12190468	12192829	Yeah, that's going on right now, and I'm sure it's a lot more entertaining.
12192849	12193709	And he's still alive.
12193929	12194350	Good for him.
12194910	12196070	Let's look at the big tote board.
12196210	12198011	Drum roll, please.
12198051	12200632	The big tally is... Oh, oh!
12201052	12201652	Zero!
12203393	12205094	Zero to zero.
12205294	12206314	Congratulations.
12206334	12210296	So it's just like football for the World Cups of soccer.
12210676	12210936	Yes.
12213577	12218222	So I win, technically, because obviously I'm the best out of all the zeros.
12218482	12220124	Alright, we'll let you plug something anyway.
12220164	12223387	And AZHP, if you want to send me a private message, I'll plug whatever you want to plug.
12224227	12225829	What do you want to plug, Tiara?
12226474	12233117	I think I will plug Geek Life, which is a blog that I run with a couple of other people, including DarkSakura.
12233257	12235478	It's geek-life.com.
12235558	12237559	We do a lot of geeky stuff, sci-fi.
12238119	12243242	We have a lot of different interesting perspectives on a lot of different stuff.
12243282	12249584	We have a former military man who's interested in tabletop gaming and stuff like that.
12249685	12254687	And we have, actually, Sterlok does a column for us where he talks about his experiences as a blind gamer.
12256008	12267368	Rob Kidman, my doctor he does a tech blog every week and Jamie does some cubicle stuff and geeks and history and all sorts of cool stuff so it's definitely a cool site to check out
12268211	12269011	Alright, check that out.
12269051	12272692	Geek-life.com And someday when I get motivated, there will be video.
12273573	12275913	Yeah, I keep bugging you about that.
12276053	12276873	I know.
12276933	12280214	I actually shot some video last night, but not enough to make a full blog.
12280254	12281575	So I'll have to do more later.
12281795	12286476	But hey, the good news is, now that I have this fancy schmancy iPhone 4, I can do the HD video on the go.
12286516	12288397	And it's actually really good quality, I gotta say.
12288437	12289017	I'm not gonna lie.
12290197	12293158	Alright, it's better than the $400 camera I bought two years ago.
12293198	12294458	That's kind of sad, actually.
12295019	12296139	I'm kind of sad about that.
12296640	12298746	Alright, Tiara, good luck with the site.
12298806	12299548	Have a good one, okay?
12300310	12301113	Alright, thank you.
12301293	12301694	Bye!
12301714	12302777	Bye!
12303664	12305145	and AZHP in chat.
12305185	12306105	Oh, I just got it here.
12307346	12313450	I am organizing my 12,000 MP3s because I ordered the new iPod Touch 4.
12314210	12321634	Have to plug Music Brains Picard because the program will analyze your MP3 files and attempt to tag them with the correct title, artist, and album.
12322074	12324516	Works even for my mislabeled pop and music albums.
12324836	12326177	It's insane how good it is.
12326277	12327257	Recommend to anyone.
12327277	12328278	What's it called?
12329019	12331602	Music Brains Picard, which is a good name for it.
12332523	12335748	Music Brains with a Z. There you go.
12336108	12341195	Now the person that I know that is the most anal retentive about their MP3 collection would be Alan.
12341235	12343759	So would you ever subject your MP3 collection to a program like this?
12344853	12349536	I'm too OCD to let anything automated affect my MP3 tags.
12350776	12357860	Yeah, I could see that it would put the space in the wrong place, and you'd just be like, no!
12358341	12366065	Yeah, if it took all of my compilations and unchecked the compilation tag, and like a batch process, I would die.
12366085	12367626	It'd be over.
12367926	12368106	Yeah.
12368886	12370047	What's ever going to happen if that drive dies?
12370067	12372408	Do you have a backup somehow, or what's going to happen?
12372428	12373529	A tape backup somehow?
12374486	12375928	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
12391636	12394097	But we have 20 more minutes.
12394717	12397438	We made it over 10 and a half hours tonight.
12397498	12398819	I hope you guys enjoyed the marathon.
12398879	12399939	Next year we just have to top it.
12400219	12406281	Hopefully I won't have a show the night before where I have to stay up until 3 in the morning and we can go a little longer.
12406361	12408442	And DarkSakura won't be taping something in the morning.
12410023	12414324	This is the after show, honey.
12414344	12418626	You really should play that one song for X-Link that was going to be my cage match pick.
12418846	12419546	All right, I'll play it.
12419826	12420847	I'll play it as we fade to black.
12421067	12421947	Go back to the all games feed.
12422447	12426188	But I still have to edit another podcast.
12426248	12426748	I know you do.
12427608	12427908	All right.
12428768	12432929	All right, first off, the chatters are yelling because we apparently haven't been going long enough.
12433029	12438111	And to that I say, oh my God, we've been going for ten and a half hours.
12438151	12439571	How many people are connected right now?
12439771	12440471	You savages, 88.
12440591	12443612	If I'm to believe these numbers I'm looking at.
12445290	12448151	I don't know how the stats work and all that stuff.
12449031	12449672	But thank you guys.
12449712	12452332	No, seriously, thank you guys for staying up late with us.

12454793	12455593	Yeah, you guys rock.
12455633	12457514	But we're getting kind of delirious and I gotta sleep soon.
12457694	12460435	Oh, don't leave us, please.
12460775	12462676	But we'll be back next week, you guys.
12462696	12463496	Don't cry for me.
12463516	12466337	We'll be back next week at 6 o'clock Pacific.

12531226	12532107	That's it, you guys.
12532327	12532707	I'm sorry.

12536909	12537169	What?
12537669	12538530	Let me look at the chat.
12538910	12539150	What?
12540351	12540891	Tell them no.
12540971	12542392	Just type N-O, period.
12543152	12543993	It's very easy.
12544313	12545453	You have to learn how to say no.
12546534	12546854	Alright.
12549679	12552024	You give them ten and a half hours and it's still not good enough.
12552625	12554609	Alright, DarkSakura is now yelling at chat.
12554649	12555591	Thank you, DarkSakura.
12560871	12586578	I would almost say this is like the longest program in the history of all games but I actually don't think that's true like I actually think all games interactive went longer one week I really do I think they went for like 12 or 13 one week we have to beat those bitches well next year next year we will and we say that endearingly I don't want anyone I don't want somebody running back saying the 11 times radio was calling you guys bitches we love you bitches we love you bitches alright I call everyone my bitches that's right
12588563	12601111	Thank you guys so much for staying up late with us and if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you like what you've heard, you want to support crazy ass independent podcasting, tell a friend about our show or about at least the All Games Network if nothing else.
12601391	12606534	Help spread the word about independent podcasting because there's a lot of people that work hard to bring this stuff to you guys.
12607715	12609436	Leave the stream on while we sleep.
12609496	12610497	That's creepy.
12610737	12611117	Shut up.
12611197	12611457	Alright.
12613498	12614839	It'd be like Sleep Talking Man.
12614900	12617341	It's cake o'clock all day long.
12617401	12619583	Just help us spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.
12619603	12621244	Tell two friends about the show.
12621624	12622625	Help us spread the word.
12623046	12624026	And that's really all we ask.
12624066	12624587	That's all we want.
12624647	12628730	And if you didn't like our show, if you thought we sucked, then, well, first off, screw you.
12629110	12629691	No, I'm just kidding.
12629711	12638518	Second off, tune into another show at All Games Radio because there's lots of talented folks there that talk about other games and maybe, you know, we didn't know the answer to the infamous two question.
12639019	12644444	We don't know a lot about sports games, but I guarantee you there's other shows on the network that will be able to answer those like that.
12644884	12648187	So check that out at the All Games Network, allgames.com.
12648687	12652591	Hey, Cyber Beast wants to sing us the national anthem of Belgium.
12653532	12655954	Oh no, he's going to plug us on national radio in Belgium.
12656494	12657474	That's awesome.
12657494	12658395	I totally misread.
12658415	12659615	Can we get a tape of that somehow?
12660176	12661816	Yeah, I really want to hear that.
12661896	12662777	I know, I want to hear that.
12662817	12663817	That's going to be awesome.
12664418	12665078	Thanks, you guys.
12665118	12666218	Dude, we're big in Belgium.
12666899	12667999	David Hasselhoff, look out.
12668059	12670500	They can listen to us while they eat their waffles.
12671521	12673421	While I eat their waffles.
12673461	12676683	Like that line from Singles to paraphrase, we are loved in Belgium.
12677216	12677676	Thanks for watching!
12693692	12694112	DarkSakura.com
12712155	12713476	Did you just forget already?
12713636	12715177	No, I didn't know who said what.
12716517	12719398	Say, Belgium guy is going to record it.
12719418	12720599	Cyber Beast is our Belgium buddy.
12721459	12722020	Now I know.
12723000	12724661	I appreciate it.
12725161	12726301	I can't go to sleep yet.
12726341	12727182	I got shit to do.
12728262	12728843	Are we out?
12729003	12729463	Is that it?
12729563	12730023	Good night?
12730403	12731003	Fade to black?
12731444	12731864	Let's go.
12731944	12733144	I guess we're going to play the credits.
12733344	12735585	Thank you so much for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio.
12736226	12736966	We'll see you next week.
12736986	12738147	Let's do it again next week.
12738207	12738767	What do you say?
12741883	12742463	See you next week!
12773409	12774524	Thanks for watching!
