0	12000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on September the 5th of 2010,
12000	17200	a Sunday here with our Orange Lounge Radio Marathon. We are almost, what, about 7 hours
17200	18200	in at this point now.
18200	19760	Dan, check on the pizza.
19760	25080	We started at about 2.05 and it's now 8.50 on the west coast here where we tape. You
25080	28680	can listen live, of course, to All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. I imagine that's what most
28680	32080	of you are doing because the podcast, you'd have to be way, way, way into that now to
32080	37080	get to this point. So, anyhow, we were going to do some news here and I was going to open
37080	40720	the Skype line again here in just a moment, so we'll have that again open if you want
40720	45880	to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Not just yet, I'm going to open it here in a moment.
45880	48920	But we had another question, I guess, come in on Ask Orange Lounge or something. It slipped
48920	53600	through the cracks and I thought it was a pretty good question, so I apologize to bother
53600	57040	Alan mid-chew there, but do you remember what that question was all about? The extra question
57040	58040	we got?
58040	62240	Which game or system did you pass up on when it came out that you never bought that you
62240	63240	now regret?
63240	67520	Or, I thought there was also a question about what system do you regret buying to?
67520	74640	Okay, well, let's do both. What system do you regret buying and what thing do you wish
74640	83320	you hadn't passed up, I guess that would be? I think for me, the thing that I most regret
83320	87880	passing up probably was the Sega Dreamcast the first time it was out. I ended up buying
87880	92980	one eventually, but I didn't buy one when it first came out in 99 because that was kind
92980	97200	of the period where I was still trying to wrap up all my college stuff and my life was
97200	100800	in this total discourse for a while. So I didn't buy one when it first came out, which
100800	105480	is a pity because it was kind of an awesome system. So that would probably be my answer,
105480	108280	the Sega Dreamcast. I did get one when they were like 40 bucks. Remember when they cut
108280	111840	the price down to like 40 bucks? Or at least GameStop was just trying to unload them or
111840	115920	something because at that point you could do all the NES emulators on the Dreamcast
115920	119920	and all that stuff. It was really cool. So that's when I finally got on the Dreamcast
119920	125040	bandwagon, but it was a little bit too late. And keep in mind guys, the Skype line is not
125040	128480	open yet. So if you're calling in, hold off, we'll get to the calls a little later here
128480	139360	in the program. Alan? I actually was able to buy an original edition of Panzer Dragoon
139360	147160	Saga for the Saturn, which came out well after the Saturn was dead. I bought it, took the
147160	153920	bus after school to go to the mall, dropped the 70 or 80 bucks for it. I ended up selling
153920	162960	it for a killing on eBay. Like two years later, I never touched it. So I bought it, never
162960	168080	played it. And Panzer Dragoon Saga is one of the greatest RPGs, especially for the Saturn.
168080	172760	And I sold it on eBay for like 200 something bucks and I needed the money. But it's like,
172760	177080	why did I do that? Like I had, I just walked into the store and bought it and I never touched
177080	184580	it. You could play ours if you want. The N64 I got for Ocarina of Time because I was very,
184580	190000	you know, at that age I was very elitist and snobby about CD-ROM versus card and how Nintendo
190000	197160	was making the wrong decision. And I bought an N64 just for Ocarina of Time and I never
197160	203040	really played any other game. I bought a bunch of games for the N64 and never touched them.
203040	208800	So that was probably a waste of money. So those would be the, wait, now you're talking
208800	213520	the games you regret buying, right? Yeah those are my two for that. Do you have any for the
213520	221140	one that I had answered about the system or game you regret not buying? I really wish
221140	226720	I could have checked out the TurboGrafx, but that was a bit out of my league at the time.
226720	230000	My friend had one and at the time I thought it was kind of stupid. I gotta be honest like
230000	234360	the games I played on it were not that great. Like we played Splatterhouse which was kind
234360	237880	of cool. Like in the fact that you know it was Splatterhouse it was kind of like a horror
237880	242960	movie type game but otherwise I didn't find the games on it to be that great. And to this
242960	247200	day I got to admit I know Dark Soccer's got a lot of love for it. Maybe it's because she's
247200	250360	out of the room. I'll dare to say this. I still kind of think the whole thing was kind
250360	254040	of overrated. Like it wasn't that great of a system I don't think. Well it was the only
254040	259240	system that got the original Street Fighter and it also got you know Castlevania X the
259240	264740	lost Castlevania game until recently. And that's cool but you know how many of us actually
264740	269280	played that? I mean sure Jamie did but she's you know cray cray. Yeah in a good way. Aside
269280	273280	from that all the systems that were even a little bit relevant I had at one point I did
273280	278560	get a Genesis. I got it years after everyone else but I got it before the PlayStation one
278560	287280	came out. The 32X and the Sega CD were all considered failures so you know don't really
287280	292400	have much regrets there. I have the original Lunar on a ROM I can play it on my computer
292400	300600	so. For me the system that I regret buying like not don't regret not buying but the game
300600	307320	the system I regret buying that I kind of wish I hadn't was a second DS. I had a DS
307320	310760	fat and then the original DS and then I bought a DS lite and I don't think I really needed
310760	314720	that lite. You don't handheld game at all. I really don't. Unless you're on a plane.
314720	318320	Yeah so I honestly think the DS fat would have been good enough for me and I should
318320	321400	have never bought the lite and I bought the lite in a moment of weakness I bought it when
321400	326800	I was traveling and literally had like nothing else to do so I went to a local game stop
326800	331040	in the town and bought the lite and I kind of wish I hadn't. What about the PSP fat?
331040	334880	I'm sure you have one of those right? I did and I ended up getting a PSP 3000 as well
334880	339080	but you know what I actually would play the PSP probably more than I did the DS. Just
339080	342720	the certain games that were on it with luminous and the final fantasy remakes and so forth.
342720	348840	I mean don't get me wrong the DS had its games too but I don't know also the PSP one I kind
348840	354320	of wore it down and it didn't work as well anymore so it kind of justified for me the
354320	359920	PSP 3000 even though that's probably not like the greatest reason to have one if that makes
359920	365880	sense but yeah. I know the idea of buying a movie on UMD is kind of ridiculous but if
365880	372220	you can get you know Kill Bill on UMD it fries for like five bucks that's got a better strain
372220	377560	on it than your iPhone does really. Oh yeah. To watch a movie on that. Good stuff. Dar
377560	384280	Sacra we're talking about the system or console you regret most buying and then the one you
384280	391680	regret not buying. I don't really have anything that I regret buying I guess if I was going
391680	396800	to pick one it would be the game com because it was awful. I don't even regret the end
396800	406720	gauge because I had some good stuff on there but as far as things I regret not buying.
406720	410200	You know what's funny Robert M. in chat gave the same answer almost at the same time the
410200	420800	game com this is where you're at. I'm because I haven't really passed up anything. I think
420800	427200	maybe no I have Proteus salamander deluxe pack because Dan's been wanting it lately.
427200	434000	Oh on the PSP? No the Saturn. Oh because they have they have a gratius collection on PSP
434000	440040	I think they did a salamander one. I've regretted never buying a duo RX because we could
440040	447960	certainly use one. Bradley? Okay let's see what I regret and probably not buying was
447960	453400	I never got a Dreamcast. I hear all the great stories about it and I just never got around
453400	459160	to it. I don't know I don't think this might have been the time. I did have a job at the
459160	463160	time so I didn't really have couldn't get it. The system was truly ahead of its time
463160	467920	if it had come out like two years later with DVD support I think I honestly think it would
467920	473320	have whipped the PlayStation 2. I really truly think that. I know I'm crazy but I do. Yeah
473320	478680	I don't think there's any systems that I regret buying because I think I like all my systems
478680	485360	that I have. His story about Prince of Dragoon makes me reminds me I actually had to sell
485360	490040	mine off because I was I had like no money at the time and really regret doing that and
490040	495880	really didn't want to buy it back. I actually did win an auction for it on eBay for like
495880	500600	200 something bucks but the guy never shipped it which was really annoying. He kept saying
500600	504200	he wasn't going to ship it but he didn't and it gave him like a fake code or something
504200	508320	but since I did it through PayPal I was able to get the money back at least for that so
508320	515440	I can see if I can find it again sometime. The game I regret of buying was the sequel
515440	519560	to Alex Kidd in Miracle World. I can't remember what it was called. Alex Kidd 2 something
519560	524640	is just because Alex Kidd in Miracle World is a great game. It takes a while to get through
524640	530200	it and it takes a while to figure it out because I played it again like a few years ago and
530200	534560	I couldn't get through it because there's like some spikes and stuff in the last few
534560	540320	levels that can be kind of hard to get past. But the second game is like it's a really
540320	549760	easy instead of having like the map like the first one has and the first one is not exactly
549760	556000	it's not linear or it's not left to right it's left to right and up and down depending
556000	560320	on the level but in the second game you only go left to right and it's actually a really
560320	568640	easy game. I beat it the first day and it's like really disappointing just because of
568640	576640	how great the first game was. Alright good answers guys. I think we're going to do some
576640	580600	quick news stories. We had a couple left over that we never got around to and then we actually
580600	584560	have some other discussion topics. So Dark Soccer I don't know if you have the piece
584560	589360	on the last one that we had left over that we didn't get to before dinner. I do. About
589360	596500	Telltale. Basically Telltale is doing a five episode Back to the Future series and it's
596500	601440	going to have Marty McFly and Doc Brown. It has Christopher Lloyd voicing Doc Brown which
601440	611240	is great and Hill Valley being 1985 and guidance from the screenwriter Bob Gale and the DeLorean.
611240	618040	So they're still working on getting the rest of it up but they're still a bit missing you
618040	624760	know. I guess what? Hoverboards and Huey Lewis in the news. I'm looking forward to seeing
624760	628600	like what the actual game looks like. You know we've heard a lot of talk about the game
628600	632400	and kind of like ramping up to it. I'm kind of excited to see what the damn thing actually
632400	635800	looks like but I'm sure it'll be fine. I have some trivia for you. You can kind of guess
635800	639920	because can I tell you a secret? Like a lot of people are going to judge me for this but
639920	645280	I don't really care. I have never seen Back to the Future one or two. We can fix that.
645280	649520	But I have seen part three isn't that weird? The Wild West one. I saw one and then I saw
649520	655380	three I didn't see two for the longest time. I never saw one or two. But Rob. What? Here's
655380	659280	some trivia for you. On the Back to the Future pinball table you know that Michael J. Fox
659280	663840	would not allow his likeness to be used so they made a generic looking dude. I think
663840	667320	I know that because you've brought it up on the show before. Actually true story. True
667320	675440	story. Alright. One other story for you guys and it has to do with the Connect Beta is
675440	680880	going on right now of course. They're starting to ship out and all that good stuff. Someone
680880	687320	is trying to sell theirs on eBay. They're trying to get twelve hundred dollars for it.
687320	693000	But it was quickly taken offline. I'm assuming Microsoft sent a cease and desist to the kind
693000	698200	of folks at eBay. So probably Microsoft did not take kindly to the fact that the unit
698200	704280	was being sold. The seller on eBay was Blue Room Project and there were no bids actually
704280	710740	made on the system. So there it was. What's interesting about it though is that I would
710740	715100	think that this and the article kind of gets into this too is that you would think these
715100	719160	connects are going to be sending back quite a bit of data to Microsoft servers so it could
719160	724440	kind of figure out who's playing connect that shouldn't be. Right? Like if you get a connect
724440	727800	early aren't you kind of setting yourself up for trouble unless you never sign on to
727800	731840	Xbox Live which I guess you could do but then how would you get the patches and all that
731840	736360	stuff. It just seems tricky tricky. I wish Loki was here to explain a little more about
736360	739640	how you could get around that but I'm just thinking you know what probably not a good
739640	744840	idea to just buy these that you don't really have the rights because Microsoft can track
744840	747920	what goes online and you're going to have to go online to get some of the patches and
747920	754600	updates so it just doesn't make sense. That was it for the news. That was all the news
754600	759900	we had set to cover this show. So if you have more stories you want to talk about we're
759900	764400	actually going to open up the Skype line. Now it is open folks. 1-877-GAME-OLR our username
764400	767760	on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio. We're going to take some more calls. So you can either
767760	772200	call us and talk to us about a news story or really anything you've heard about tonight
772200	781480	or you can send us a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can send us a tweet and we'll
781480	785560	read those again in a little bit if we're getting some tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r
785560	788840	and I think Dark Soccer had mentioned something about wanting to do the mailbag again but
788840	793480	I don't know if any letters have dropped in. We're kind of monitoring all those pretty
793480	799480	closely right now. I'm actually going to kind of load up the tweets. Let's see how those
799480	803960	are going. Alright we are getting some calls. Let's go to the phones. Hi you're on OrangeLawnTradio
803960	809400	who's this? Hey this is XLink. Hey XLink welcome to hour 7 of the marathon. How ya doing? Doing
809400	815760	good and you? I'm still awake that's a good thing. What's on your mind? Nothing much.
815760	820800	I'm really excited to hear that they are going to do a mini series based on Back to the Future
820800	826080	which is hopefully going to be epic now they're getting actual actors to do the voices from
826080	831040	the movie and stuff so that's going to be cool. I would love to see Michael J. Fox come
831040	837720	on also because that would be excellent. Also Telltale also got excited for it because they
837720	841980	announced a new poker game coming out this fall with different characters from different
841980	850680	game series. Poker Night at the Inventory with Tycho from Penny Arcade, the Strong Bad from
850680	859460	Home Star Runner, Max from Sam & Max and then the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. So that should
859460	864160	be pretty interesting of a poker game when they get that all said and done. Yeah to be
864160	868960	fair it was brought up about 6 hours ago but yeah we did talk about it a little bit but
868960	874960	it sounds kind of interesting. I'm not usually somebody that gets super into the poker games
874960	879920	but I kind of like where this one's going. It's an interesting hodgepodge of characters.
879920	884400	What do you kind of hope you get out of this poker game? Just the wackiness because of
884400	887020	Telltale and the way they're going to put this together there's going to be some kind
887020	891280	of epic fighting going on between characters and stuff which is going to be absolutely
891280	901280	great to see. That's the over-slapstick humor that they usually do with some of their games.
901280	907000	So what else is on your mind? Anything? No I've been playing a lot of WoW as of course
907000	911560	you should know. Of course because I play a lot of WoW too. Fancy that. Yeah we all
911560	918960	do. What are some of your WoW accomplishments recently? Almost had the TOC 25 which I would
918960	925800	have been very proud of. Just a lot of different odds and ends. ICC getting farther than that
925800	933560	now in the 10 man so with the guild. Hopefully I'm really going to be proud because I'm going
933560	937880	to try to go for some of the other odds and ends like the fishing mounts and stuff like
937880	945840	that. Awesome. Yeah so. Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you
945840	949640	go and take more calls? Nope that's pretty much about it. Well you have a good night
949640	957560	good luck with WoW. Thank you you too. Alright bye. Alright 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on
957560	968280	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio you can give us a call. Alright. I was just ringing off the
968280	971380	hook a minute ago so I'm hoping more calls will come in. We are getting some tweets thank
971380	978800	you guys. Twitter.com slash OLR we'll get to those in just a moment. How you doing over
978800	987360	there DuckSock are you good? Yeah I'm a little woozy. From the drinking? Yeah I'm starting
987360	990920	to get a little like heyyyy. Brandy hits me really fast. I don't care. Alright hey you're
990920	996280	on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this? Hi this is Spazzinator. Hey Spazzinator welcome to the
996280	1002760	marathon what's on your mind? Yeah well this is probably a question that's probably better
1002760	1011960	answered by Loki but since he took off a few hours ago I'll ask you guys. I'm kind of sort
1011960	1020320	of toying around with the idea of more or less recreating our K-Camp that I once saw
1020320	1029360	going years back. I don't know if you've ever seen this one particular model. It had a samurai
1029360	1040240	showdown 4 in it and basically the configuration was and it came in two pieces. The one section
1040240	1049560	had the joysticks and the buns and the coin slots and all that and maybe the second piece
1049560	1057000	was basically the monitoring. There was like 5 or 10 feet away and there was like a chain
1057000	1062520	flicking the two together. Wait wait wait you gotta back up here. This was a special
1062520	1070840	machine or a custom machine you're saying? Yeah I think more or less recreating at least
1070840	1084920	part of the custom machine for myself or at least the part with the controls on it. You
1084920	1092360	know aside from the part with the controls like the joystick and all that I was wondering
1092360	1099640	what kind of materials do you think I should be using to build the cabin itself like should
1099640	1104400	I use like particle boards and laminate or? Yeah this is definitely a low key question
1104400	1108040	because I don't know anything about this stuff but I will tell you one like somewhat cheap
1108040	1112120	alternative that I've heard being used before is like actually trying to find old arcade
1112120	1116280	cabinets that for whatever reason the games inside them don't work anymore because the
1116280	1120440	cabinets seem to make pretty good shells for these custom cabinets for whatever it is you're
1120440	1125440	trying to build. A samurai showdown 4 case or whatever it is. Those are usually a really
1125440	1131280	good place to start at least from what I've heard and I think that's what quite a few
1131280	1137800	people have done. Like don't you guys have like a custom cabinet in some time? We just
1137800	1144480	modified a pole position back in the day and used it and put a damp built the layout and
1144480	1150600	everything with the buttons and joysticks. Yeah. Otherwise as far as like specific materials
1150600	1155040	that work best not really my realm of expertise because I've never built a cabinet so I'm
1155040	1159240	not going to profess to know that stuff but I'm sure there are some websites or yeah Loki
1159240	1164520	is a good resource you know when he's here when he's not babysitting. Yeah ultimately
1164520	1173960	my goal is to you know like let's say get you know to use this is just an example I'm
1173960	1184160	thinking of gaining one of those $150 arcade sticks for the PNC or 360 drop drop that into
1184160	1192880	the cabinet run but arcade sticks wires to my gain system and then in turn have my gain
1192880	1199320	system go to my high def TV and more or less kind of sort of have a arcade cabinet but
1199320	1205520	not quite. Well I know that Loki was also going to be working on a project about building
1205520	1210200	arcade cabinets for like a hundred bucks so you know I'm all about building on a budget
1210200	1217920	that's for sure. Alright well thanks for taking my call. Alright. Alright have a good one.
1217920	1223440	You too buddy have a good night. You too. Alright. 1877 game OLR or our username on
1223440	1229320	Skype is orange lounge radio. Yeah we're taking more calls I've been seeing quite a few it's
1229320	1233320	like they'll all come in all at once. I think you can tell when like the 30 seconds catches
1233320	1237180	up to everybody because you know there's time from the time we say something to encode to
1237180	1241360	send all games to broadcast to you so like I think after that 30 seconds is up like the
1241360	1245480	phone just lights up it's kind of awesome. Take a few more calls here and then maybe
1245480	1249480	go back to the Twitter. Did we check the email bag? Do we have any new emails to go to? I
1249480	1257100	think they were junk mail. Stupid spammers. Spammers need to go kill themselves. Not really
1257100	1263240	though but yes. Alright more calls. Hi you're on orange lounge radio the marathon who's
1263240	1269760	this? Legend of Zaku from your cell phone. Hey Legend of Zaku from your cell phone. Welcome
1269760	1275960	to hour 7 of the marathon what's up? Oh wow you guys are really pushing it this time aren't
1275960	1283080	you? Yeah a little bit. We haven't done a show this long since DDR tournaments that's
1283080	1289580	for sure. Right so yeah apparently the the biggest thing right now is Duke Nukem Forever
1289580	1294920	basically coming back from the dead in a more spectacular way. I never thought it would
1294920	1298880	actually happen. Oh yes what do you think about all this news that has come out of Penny
1298880	1305040	Arcade Expo? All I know is that it you know it better they better just stick to the schedule
1305040	1312160	get it out because the last thing we need is for other folks to just you know have this
1312160	1318840	game be the butt of everyone's joke again. At the same time though at this point Zaku
1318840	1323960	what's another year? Like you know if they if they delay it to 2012 what's another year
1323960	1329960	at this point? But but the game is so close I mean people are already playing a demo of
1329960	1337440	it and what I hear is like at polishing stages. No I get it it's just like. I agree if they're
1337440	1342560	showing it on the floor at Penny Arcade Expo it's darn close to done and they're they're
1342560	1348000	really I mean showing it at Penny Arcade Expo keep in mind they bypassed E3 to make this
1348000	1352700	announcement they if this has been in development since 2009 they could have announced this
1352700	1358040	at E3 but they didn't they went and took it directly to people like you and me at Penny
1358040	1363360	Arcade Expo that's like unzipping it and whipping it out on the table for everybody to admire
1363360	1370880	that's what. Then again this game actually appeals to the hardcore demographic not necessarily
1370880	1376760	something you would want you know average Joe gamer who pretty much doesn't have a clue
1376760	1382480	as to what Duke Nukem is unless they have been playing during the you know mid to late
1382480	1390040	90s. Well I mean they've tried to drop these little inklings of Duke Nukem to put it back
1390040	1395400	in our consciousness in the past couple years like the Duke Nukem release on Xbox Live and
1395400	1400600	I think there's another like isn't there a 2D Duke Nukem game set to come out? Pretty
1400600	1408000	much I mean the whole point is that I guess I kind of find it surprising that the first
1408000	1414200	you know you know the studio behind Borderlands and the guys found it it pretty much has connection
1414200	1421440	to 3D Realms and the you know and the folks who ran it up until its demise. I never thought
1421440	1426240	is you know that guy's career is pretty much owed to Duke Nukem. Well now I'm wondering
1426240	1430400	though if um you know they knew that they had this game that Gearbox has had this game
1430400	1435040	since like 2009 like when did Duke Nukem come out? Didn't it come out about a year ago?
1435040	1440560	I guess I guess it would be about I'm wondering if they didn't push out that Duke Nukem Live
1440560	1444360	around the time that they knew that Gearbox would be taking this game on to kind of help
1444360	1447960	push Duke Nukem back to the front of everybody's minds like that's kind of one thing I'm thinking
1447960	1452560	now in retrospect. Wondering how the timing of everything worked out. All I know is that
1452560	1458120	basically from what I read in the article like a Taco article when they interviewed
1458120	1464380	you know that guy basically after 3D Realms shut down most of it was pretty much a two
1464380	1470280	bit operation running from people's apartments. Pretty much a garage game up until a point
1470280	1475760	where Gearbox took control of it. So it was pretty much it was pretty much coming together
1475760	1481840	piecemeal so there's no way you would mount something unless you have a solid backing
1481840	1486800	from one of the developers able to actually finish the job instead of putting it through
1486800	1493560	development hell. 15 years is like pretty much pushing it for any product. You know
1493560	1500840	even Starcraft 2 but then again Blizzard took their time and they got it out the door. But
1500840	1506560	3D Realms pretty much you know that's what cost them you know that's what took the studio
1506560	1513080	down with them. The fact they couldn't deliver. Well I mean you know again it's been shown
1513080	1519120	now it's something that is actually going to come out so we'll you know see what happens.
1519120	1526280	Right and hopefully everything everything will make sense and at least I can hear more
1526280	1532720	like one liners out of this guy. That's pretty much what OLR needs a lot more Duke Nukem
1532720	1539400	one liners out of nowhere. I don't know the soundboard is kind of saved for special occasions
1539400	1543560	we'll see. And real quick a comment from our chat room Derek H is asking is the caller
1543560	1550640	saying that 3D Realms was a garage development house? No I'm just saying that after 3D Realms
1550640	1558960	blew up because of Duke Nukem Forever's development the folks from 3D Realms in the transition
1558960	1564560	the gearbox you know in between that time started working you know worked on Duke Nukem
1564560	1571880	Forever from their apartment. So some of it during that time with 3D Realms the demise
1571880	1577080	still got handed over the gearbox was pretty much a two-bit operation. I know 3D Realms
1577080	1582480	pretty much a you know big-name studio back in the day. Hell they really they turned out
1582480	1593640	a lot of PC types and now I'm pretty much fond of. All right. So I hope you know. Well
1593640	1597080	I think it's going to be great. The only thing that's going to be sad is that since it's
1597080	1600960	not you know just like Borderlands you're not going to get quests in Duke Nukem as far
1600960	1605160	as I know so it won't be like you know hey you need to go up to the stripper and tipper
1605160	1610320	although I guess you do have to press R to pee in the toilet. No the whole point of Duke
1610320	1617520	Nukem is just pick up and play you know kill people max out on your on your try to like
1617520	1622440	get all the power ups and weapons and just go all out. That's the whole point is it you're
1622440	1627720	just killing you're just shooting people like do but instead you're just like you know you're
1627720	1633280	killing a lot more aliens and monsters. All right. And with the bottom one-liners. All
1633280	1636360	right well Zaku we got to let you go to get some more calls but I hope you can get your
1636360	1642000	hands on Duke Nukem soon and see see it's the real thing. All right. Later. Have a good
1642000	1646080	one. 877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio we have another call coming in.
1646080	1651760	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hey this is DJ Blaziken. Hey DJ Blaziken what's
1651760	1657320	on your mind? Oh not much other than I've been listening to this whole marathon shindig
1657320	1663600	since it started up and the whole music break thing is bringing me back to the old days
1663600	1669640	back from the really old episodes I started listening to you guys back on your old station.
1669640	1674080	Well I'm glad to hear I'm glad to hear it that's kind of the idea behind it now for
1674080	1677600	those that are listening on the podcast we can't do the copyrighted music that we were
1677600	1681320	playing during our little breaks here for meals and potty and all that stuff but yeah
1681320	1683840	we're playing a lot of the music you know when Orange Launch Radio back when we were
1683840	1690080	a station on live 365 we would play music from DDR and like of just a variety of the
1690080	1695360	other music based games and some of the dance mania CDs that inspired the music song list
1695360	1703120	in DDR and so forth. Yeah so of all things okay I've been a little bit on a dirty shore
1703120	1709840	fanatic so I've been fist pumping throughout the whole breaks. Wow. I don't think I've
1709840	1715760	ever heard anyone say that about this program there's a first for everything. Hey by the
1715760	1724440	way um actually just um thinking of systems that regret not buying systems that do regret
1724440	1738840	buying um somehow I regret not buying a Sega Dreamcast myself because and actually you
1738840	1743160	know what I also had a second system I regret not buying because I had to kick ass fighting
1743160	1752800	game on it was um the N64 which it had killer instinct and the controller itself the standard
1752800	1757080	controller was perfect for fighting games especially if you're in the Street Fighter
1757080	1763040	because you had the six buttons you had the A, B and then the little yellow buttons the
1763040	1768240	C buttons or whatever they were called something like that was perfect for Street Fighter.
1768240	1772040	I have to admit I got used to Street Fighter on a Super Nintendo controller like the whole
1772040	1775540	fact that some of the like punches and kicks were shoulder buttons like totally didn't
1775540	1779720	bother me like I just I was able to get used to it. Did you ever remember the Capcom controller
1779720	1783500	that they came out for the Super Nintendo? Oh no and I thought that was on the Genesis
1783500	1786800	was the special like six button. They did it in Japan. Oh really huh. The six button
1786800	1791480	controller where you held a part of it in your hand and you played with the top of your
1791480	1800080	fingers and it was it was kind of uncomfortable. Yeah it sounds it. And on top of that a game
1800080	1806280	I regret not buying but I've actually got to play well I now finally got to buy and
1806280	1817880	own is um full caliber Dreamcast. Good stuff. I wish I had GoldenEye too because yeah I
1817880	1822280	mean occasionally my friend would bring it over to the daycare occasionally and he'd
1822280	1827880	be over send 64 and we'd all just sit down four player multiplayer it was just epicness
1827880	1834840	and you know I never owned it it was just like god now I wish I could plop some money
1834840	1846040	down on that. And now the thing about it um a game that I do regret buying wow it would
1846040	1853800	have to be DDR Disney Channel edition. You must have been a real DDR completionist to
1853800	1861720	get that. Yeah yeah. It's a no it's another DDR worthy of the whole um bumper old bumper
1861720	1868800	from Step Squad 3. This DDR sucks. It ain't a solo. Actually solo was actually pretty
1868800	1874940	good. Um and solo was awesome that was some of the best music they had in DDR ever especially
1874940	1881960	solo 2000 was amazing. Just saying. Yeah I think my arcade had the solo 2000 but stupid
1881960	1887520	idiots trade for pump it up. Not even the same. I want to back up real quick because
1887520	1890240	you were talking about like the Dreamcast and missing out on that and everything which
1890240	1894080	was the same thing I said for the system that um I kind of regret not buying but then I
1894080	1898520	also think about it and it's like you know at that time in my life there was no way I
1898520	1904560	could have paid that type of money for that system you know I was barely out of college
1904560	1908800	there and I didn't really have a job I mean I sort of worked temp jobs in the summer and
1908800	1914300	so forth. There is no way I would have been able to afford one so I regret not being able
1914300	1920320	to afford it I guess but I you know I couldn't buy it. I guess I can't say I don't regret
1920320	1925640	not buying one because I was able to buy you know food and you know other things but. Sorry
1925640	1926640	Scott.
1926640	1931080	Actually I'm contrary to the whole Dreamcast thing um the babysitter my mom sent me to
1931080	1937480	a bunch of times he had like a bunch of systems to play and like six or seven arcade games
1937480	1941160	like in Mortal Kombat 2, Asteroids, Snow Bros.
1941160	1945160	Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait how old were you when you were going
1945160	1946160	to the babysitter?
1946160	1948760	I was I was like six.
1948760	1949760	The Manny?
1949760	1950760	Seven.
1950760	1956560	Okay you they were letting you play Mortal Kombat 2 at six years old?
1956560	1963920	Yeah and Mortal Kombat he had he had Final Doom on the PlayStation I played that a lot
1963920	1968040	actually when one of his friends would come over we'd link up the two Playstations to
1968040	1976280	play uh four player Final Doom and once again FPS epicness which that's why I ended up buying
1976280	1982920	um what was it I ended up buying Doom on Xbox Live and Soul Calibur.
1982920	1986880	Am I the only one that's like what's wrong with this picture why is the six-year-old
1986880	1994360	being allowed to play Mortal Kombat 2 and Doom when he's with the Manny like I don't
1994360	1995360	get that.
1995360	2002280	Hey but but the cool thing was like not only that did I play it in his house but on the
2002280	2007600	occasions I'd go over to the mall and then my mom like she was searching for me so she
2007600	2012080	knew I was in the arcade section of the mall at the time and this is the same mall that
2012080	2019320	won't fix the ITG machine it's still down which sucks um but at the time they had a
2019320	2025120	Mortal Kombat 4 arcade machine and I would play that constantly because it was only one
2025120	2026120	token to play.
2026120	2028860	And how old were you eight?
2028860	2033840	I was 10 and actually the first game I ever got wow actually the first game system I ever
2033840	2040540	got was a Game Boy a Game Boy Pocket first two games I got one with a combo game cartridge
2040540	2048720	Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 and then the other was Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back which which
2048720	2054760	I loved the cantina song that would play whenever the characters were bringing up dialogue.
2054760	2059400	And those games those games didn't screw you up as a kid like you're fine now you have
2059400	2062520	a good sense of reality you're you're stable mentally and all that good stuff.
2062520	2066520	Not pretty much like my mom was like nah nah nah it's cute violence blah blah blah it
2066520	2071920	will make you go crazy I'm like really and I bought GTA Liberty City Stories behind her
2071920	2082200	back on Amazon for a PSP hacking point because it was used to get the hen to activate but
2082200	2087880	it ended up not working as well as I thought the hack would work but I just had fun with
2087880	2091720	that and just she never knew about it.
2091720	2096480	Have you told your mom recently about all these things you were playing behind her back?
2096480	2098240	When you were growing up?
2098240	2102240	You kind of figured out after a while what I was playing but she didn't care by the time
2102240	2108720	I was she was like you know as long as here's the good thing I didn't become that stupid
2108720	2113960	Virginia Tech shooter or the Von Mar shooter which you probably might have heard about
2113960	2120040	yeah I've heard about them and and you know I didn't go out and shoot at the high school
2120040	2124680	I didn't go out with a sniper rifle and shoot a bunch of people if I felt like I wanted
2124680	2129800	to deck someone in the face I waited until I got home or got on the bus started up GTA
2129800	2134760	and started beating up random civilians in the game that's that was my anger management.
2134760	2139560	I like what hoofhearted says in chat saying my father didn't care that I played MK but
2139560	2146840	my mom got scared and said you're going to live with your auntie in Bel Air.
2146840	2151320	Alright Blaze I gotta let you go so we can try and get some more calls and do more marathon
2151320	2153320	but thank you for that one last thing.
2153320	2159280	Yes um okay basically the PSP in and of itself is almost like a Super Nintendo controller
2159280	2167080	in and of itself with a screen this was an analog stick yes and Alpha 3 Max plays fine
2167080	2172680	and I go between that and Street Fighter 4 and I'm looking to get in the Evo tournament
2172680	2181160	one day it'd be Daigo well good luck to you alright alright have a good rockin show we

2233640	2243960	evening uh if that's sweet who's been with you all this time good morning to you my friend
2243960	2250040	so gosh when we started it was probably what like midnight where you are no it was what
2250040	2254880	was it if I remember no no no it was like 11 o'clock or something well that's not too
2254880	2260520	bad we've been going for seven hours now so just seven and a half oh my god seven and
2260520	2269680	a half hours so do the math oh whatever all right but um what was I gonna say well um
2269680	2280160	yeah um Mass Effect is uh kind of interesting almost in that sense that well finally DLC
2280160	2286980	for that game will will uh show up oh for yeah because that's right Mass Effect Mass
2286980	2293300	Effect 2 right has it had a lot of download content come out DLC that you actually want
2293300	2304020	to buy because it well because that backstory with a shadow broker is like winner huh really
2304020	2313120	nice or yeah but here and uh I and I already have actually read the comic for it uh the
2313120	2318520	Mass Effect Redemption Mass Effect Redemption comic what do you think which takes place
2318520	2328780	actually around that before Mass Effect around that time when um well or when it takes place
2328780	2335440	like before Mass Effect 2 let me ask you about this even though it's totally not to get it
2335440	2339120	not the part that you wanted to call in talk about but there was a rumor last week on the
2339120	2344520	show about um that I guess Matthew Fox from Lost had been cast to be the dude in a Mass
2344520	2350760	Effect movie what do you think about the possibility of a Mass Effect movie Mass Effect movie would
2350760	2360600	be kind of nice in some way but well how but my problem though is that my Shepard is not
2360600	2370040	male she's female Shepard is female points Shepard can be whoever you want them to be
2370040	2375360	that is true that is true you know um completely not what you were asking but um I only play
2375360	2382840	female characters in Warcraft because people treat you better well so do I well yeah even
2382840	2392240	though the uh the ironic thing about that front is that well um I didn't get to max
2392240	2401160	level at um I did I didn't get to max level that soon actually because I like every time
2401160	2407800	I didn't hit max level but then I think I did at some point anyway yeah because I mostly
2407800	2416560	played female characters too and what happens well I roll a troll male and I and I hit max
2416560	2422760	level it's funny the characters you will get most invested in out of everything else I
2422760	2427000	gotta read this comment from chat real quick uh DDR dollar says uh in our chat room this
2427000	2431320	caller reminds me of when I was younger and said the avatar from Ultima was female you
2431320	2437720	know yeah when I played Ultima quest for the avatar on the um NES usually like half half
2437720	2442040	of the different class types you could get were females and I think usually the one I
2442040	2447920	would opt to play is like the druid I think or the shepherdess and both were female so
2447920	2453540	you know I I totally get that reference DDR dollars saying so just kind of funny it wasn't
2453540	2457040	that I was in that case it was pre-assigned if you want to be the fighter it was the male
2457040	2462360	if you want to be and in Ultima 3 was the same way like the paladin in Ultima 3 was
2462360	2466120	female she had a little heart for the shield which was just very precious see a little
2466120	2472760	it's cute adorable anyhow so um unfortunately I can't think of any system that I regret
2472760	2480400	buying in some way because I don't get any of my system buys unfortunately what about
2480400	2487160	a game I might regret is that I smashed a uh smashed two game boys oh my gosh oh my
2487160	2494880	gosh I really and one of them was play and I actually know they know the two uh and the
2494880	2500860	two games that I did buy whatever did play well first of it was that I smashed my original
2500860	2509480	game boy while while I was playing Kirby's pinball land that game was awesome some the
2509480	2516560	other time was uh when I was uh I smashed my other gameboy pocket playing uh warrior
2516560	2521400	land for some strange reason those Nintendo pinball games were so freaking good though
2521400	2526200	like uh the pokemon pinball was so awesome I used to play that on it I don't think I
2526200	2533520	would have broke a gameboy over it but you know uh oh but here's the other thing though
2533520	2540080	I have uh oh but here's the other thing though I was uh much younger at that time because
2540080	2546360	I was like 12 or something when I smashed my first gameboy or something I think and
2546360	2553040	you've had anger management classes since then no I haven't and well and well what is
2553040	2559040	it and uh and usually I don't break stuff the only thing that I've managed to break
2559040	2569120	was uh oh I heard managed to break was uh and then he cut out I think we lost the connection
2569120	2574600	there that's a bummer I hope we didn't lose the whole damn internet again okay good no
2574600	2578280	it's still strongly disconnected and I see the chat room going there so we're good well
2578280	2582000	unfortunately we lost hockey ripper but uh anger management I want to talk about this
2582000	2588720	actually let's talk about your most like angry video game moment that just made you like
2588720	2593760	you you wanted to break shit or something like that angry video game moment Alan it
2593760	2599520	looks like you're you're thinking of something Mike Tyson's punch out um the guy in the turban
2599520	2603720	that span around and he had the little gem on his turban that sparkle when he was gonna
2603720	2609800	do his move tiger something yes him he brought me to tears did you actually cried I cried
2609800	2617920	so much over that guy that's awesome I couldn't beat him and it just I cried would you would
2617920	2620600	you actually do the whole like crying into your pillow thing where you like you throw
2620600	2626320	the controller down and jump on your bed and go no it was more it was far more heart wrenching
2626320	2632840	and really I was can you describe I was utterly defeated as a person my nine ten year old
2632840	2639000	self just had like these bitter tears of several people in chat thank you great tiger was his
2639000	2643960	name you've you've clearly tried to block that from your mind great tiger made you cry
2643960	2649420	yeah I want to like make you like a little like t-shirt or something like with this picture
2649420	2654080	on a great tiger made me cry and here's the thing I actually got up to Mike Tyson in that
2654080	2659640	game and I never actually beat it because he was impossible but yet I was like this
2659640	2666880	is I was like this is just stupid how hard this is so then I just stopped playing to
2666880	2674160	Mike Tyson but did that one boss I just cried I think I've thrown controllers like power
2674160	2678840	outages have made me thrown controllers which is very frustrating I can't think of like
2678840	2683960	any boss fights or anything that have really driven me to that or or cry I didn't get a
2683960	2689080	drop in Wow the other day and that no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not that bad I'll
2689080	2696640	do the Huffy stomp I'll do the yeah you roll like in 95 and then someone else that happened
2696640	2702880	that fucking shit happened last week I knew it and you were like no it's okay and like
2702880	2707920	you type to chat you're like oh it's okay congratulations I'm glad you want it but I'm
2707920	2711620	like he's fucking sitting there fucking throwing a fit like these probably like pillows are
2711620	2717280	getting thrown in his place right now god damn it why do we even fucking do these rooms
2717280	2723440	I hope that drop was worth it when I push you down the stairs next time I see you anger
2723440	2727560	management dark soccer any any moment in gaming where you've just gotten so angry you wanted
2727560	2732120	to break something playing Dan and x-men versus Street Fighter I just wanted to take the controller
2732120	2736640	and embed it firmly into his skull because see Dan back in the day and he's still like
2736640	2742400	this to a degree but not nearly as bad as it used to be Dan likes to gloat and likes
2742400	2749280	to be alpha male you know big junk you don't say and back in the day he had that problem
2749280	2755880	even more and so he would kick my ass soundly until I would play cami and gambit and he
2755880	2761440	would just haha haha you know he was Nelson but he would be really dickly about it and
2761440	2766200	finally I'm like I'm just gonna beat you with this controller I beat Alan with my shoe last
2766200	2770580	night how was it Alan I'll tell you was it hot let me tell you about this in a minute
2770580	2775080	actually uh because we have a call story we have a seriously who uses a shoe all right
2775080	2780320	uh caller you're on the air hi who's this I haven't derailed you guys just derailed
2780320	2784280	me with the talk about their shoe this is the like third time you've called in tonight
2784280	2788000	but that's okay what's on your mind yeah you must be tired of me calling all the damn time
2788000	2792880	it's all right it's all good what's on your mind I guess I have an interesting Xbox Live
2792880	2798880	story which in turn I end up getting two months free service out of them okay how'd this work
2798880	2805560	well I always buy the cards to reload my subscription it's a rarity that I actually log in with
2805560	2810840	my credit card give my information to rip me for a month or two now the last time this
2810840	2815700	happened they start automatically debiting my card I'm like no don't do that and I set
2815700	2821460	it to make sure that it would not do that so what I had so you know I figured I'd go
2821460	2827120	back to the card you know refill one month or two they had like that one dollar special
2827120	2831280	so I'm like you know what I'm going to sign up for that so I signed up for about two months
2831280	2837200	of service and then I went out and got another card they get an email from saying that they
2837200	2843440	were unable to bill my card because the card was invalid so I shrugged it off like no big
2843440	2847820	deal you would think that they would see it in the system I automatically re-upped my
2847820	2855960	account for another year every two three weeks I would get an email about that then one week
2855960	2862860	in July I figured I'd jump on fire something on Netflix I go in and it says that my account
2862860	2869960	is back to silver and I'm like what the hell is going on I call them up asking them why
2869960	2876720	did they cancel my account and they said I did not pay for it and I'm explaining to them
2876720	2884400	if you see in the system I purchased a one year card so that makes no sense so here I
2884400	2889720	am screaming at the poor guy in India who in turn is like the best thing is to get you
2889720	2895480	a supervisor I'm like yeah put him on I'm explaining the whole situation he's like my
2895480	2900920	hands are tied there's nothing I can do at that point I just drop a nuclear bomb because
2900920	2906760	I'm just beyond aggravated about all of this and he goes what what we can do to have a
2906760	2913760	manager call you back within 48 hours fine here's my number call mecca 48 hours nope
2913760	2922680	nothing absolutely nothing so I go online wait wait wait I'm missing okay they were
2922680	2927680	set up to charge you automatically no I canceled that okay you canceled that but they tried
2927680	2933500	to do it anyway yes and then you use prepaid cards yes and what were they doing were they
2933500	2937400	adding it to the time in the past that you hadn't paid for where you were like I don't
2937400	2942980	want to use this or I don't I'm still lost right now what it was doing the card was supposed
2942980	2948760	to kick in after I paid for one month which was in April okay so my lie was supposed to
2948760	2956260	go from May 2010 to May I guess May 2011 April 2011 okay but I kept getting the email saying
2956260	2961880	that they were not able to build my car for my account and yet I it's it's listed that
2961880	2967900	I already have a year with them oh so for some reason they're still trying to charge
2967900	2973320	your card even though you put the prepaid one on right now I get it okay so the manager
2973320	2980760	manager never called me back so I go on to the consumerist find like contacts from Microsoft
2980760	2985900	I sent emails to Steve Ballmer and somebody else in charge at Microsoft with Xbox live
2985900	2992880	nice within two days I get a call from the manager I explained everything he profuse
2992880	2997980	he apologizes and goes into the system it seems that on the supervisor's end they don't
2997980	3005060	have access to billing that's crazy like what's the point then you think there ought to be
3005060	3011480	somebody that can fix it you know it's just weird yeah very I'm like I'm yelling at the
3011480	3015580	guy log into your system and fix it oh we don't have access to that how do you not have
3015580	3020480	access to you know uh gold anthro in our chat room at chat dot orange laundry dot com says
3020480	3025620	it's because of shit like this that I'm just gonna stick to prepaid cards now I don't blame
3025620	3031300	him but you know damn it a dollar for a month is a good deal you can't beat that that is
3031300	3036060	that is a very good deal all right Rama anything else you wanna say real quick cuz we're gonna
3036060	3040900	get back to angry games and beating with shoes and stuff in a minute long story short the
3040900	3048660	guy contacts me back he canceled my my gold sends me a new code so now I'm good from July
3048660	3053900	to like June of 2011 so I end up getting like two extra months out of the deal must be nice
3053900	3059180	yeah so in the moral of the story is yelling at the supervisor fixes the trick every time
3059180	3063220	I'm kidding I'm kidding don't I used to work in a call center please don't sometimes they're
3063220	3068060	I know don't yell at them if they can't help you find me I'll give you an email address
3068060	3073460	to somebody to take care of it for you yeah exactly all right all right Rama I'm gonna
3073460	3077420	let you go for real have a good one okay buddy okay good I need more vodka all right good
3077420	3082900	luck have fun all right where were we oh yes beating with shoes and Alan's like I want
3082900	3091340	to tell this story yeah so Rob does not parallel park he doesn't in San Francisco near where
3091340	3097700	I live parking is more precious than platinum or gold so if you see a space especially if
3097700	3103540	it's a rock star space right in front of where you're going you park in it but you know if
3103540	3107580	you're used to parking lots and you can't parallel park you just say fuck that and you
3107580	3113500	keep going so whenever Rob under extreme duress has to parallel park I will basically tease
3113500	3119860	the hell out of him for it because he usually will not try and last night when we were going
3119860	3124460	to his rocky horror performance there were basically three blocks of parallel parking
3124460	3129180	without cars so he just had to like drive in and sort of scoot his car up to the edge
3129180	3133140	and I was like I don't know are you sure you can handle it it's parallel parking so he
3133140	3138780	takes his shoe off and starts whapping me with it no no it was I said I if you better
3138780	3144460	be quieter I'm gonna beat you in my shoe and then I think I like hit the curb with parking
3144460	3149060	yeah see and then finally he stops the car he's like oh wait how far away from the curb
3149060	3155780	am I and I'm like there's no one here like my original making fun of you still stands
3155780	3160500	and then he took his shoe off and he hit me with it well you deserved it yeah you know
3160500	3166300	I'm not I'm not one to advocate domestic violence but you know so yeah he gives me stink eye
3166300	3170500	for making fun of his parallel parking and then he you know stops the car and we're like
3170500	3174820	five feet away from the curb with no cars he didn't have to wiggle wiggle in at all
3174820	3180420	no not at all yeah good times yeah I agree with brake man in our chat room fuck parallel
3180420	3186020	parking I agree with that and misty says fuck driving that's your that's your attitude that's
3186020	3190540	where I'm at yeah what is it about driving that you're just you're just not gonna do
3190540	3199500	it the expense in you know car payment gas insurance someone gets drunk and hit you you're
3199500	3206220	dead you know it's just it's awful but it's really nice like being able to go wherever
3206220	3211180	you want whenever you want like that's really you don't have to rely on really anyone else
3211180	3217660	just saying I had the internet at home I don't have to go anywhere what about food Amazon
3217660	3221860	will ship it what about if it's like oh my god I need some pink berry right now or I'm
3221860	3229340	gonna like kill somebody I went there I heard they played Abba mm-hmm amazing I had the
3229340	3236100	chocolate with the the hazelnut crunch stuff on it and I wanted to die it was good I've
3236100	3240140	been telling you it's amazing I love the way that place is designed it's cute very cute
3240140	3245860	little place sorry to derail that's okay misty and chat says it's a combo of the expense
3245860	3251360	the idiots on the road and my fail attention span long drives can be tough like sometimes
3251360	3256060	I'm like oh I want to take like a really long drive like I'm gonna go drive across country
3256060	3259980	or I'll drive like I'll do something crazy like go drive to Kansas and visit Shane is
3259980	3264420	like halfway across the country or I'll drive up to Canada like Vancouver or something and
3264420	3270260	then I'm like oh god that would be so grueling though like at the drive there is not usually
3270260	3275820	the bad part it's the drive home like our Portland trip right yeah I thought we were
3275820	3281200	making well we were making really good time we got through Oregon I was like this is great
3281200	3285220	you know this isn't bothering me at all they don't then once we got into Reading California
3285220	3290560	and realized there were still what three four hours after the drive wanted to die get me
3290560	3294740	out of this car it's tough I think dark soccer has done a similar drive right haven't you
3294740	3299100	driven all the way up to southern Washington we right we drove to Prosser Washington pretty
3299100	3304460	much just as far I think last year we did the drive drive drive up there is great well
3304460	3311460	Dan drove I slept and he would stop me on the way back for snow talking more about angry
3311460	3315320	games I didn't ask Bradley this question yet I gotta see I cuz Bradley's one of those very
3315320	3320020	quiet like if you can't tell he's very quiet very shy does it does not get angry I gotta
3320020	3323140	ask him if he's ever gotten angry he's like I'm gonna kill this bitch wait hold on hold
3323140	3326340	on I gotta say this chat comment real quick though xlink in our chat room talking about
3326340	3331380	angry stuff I got upset when a certain member of my guild had won the role for the battered
3331380	3335460	hilt twice and then decided to give one of them to his boyfriend that likes to beat him
3335460	3349060	with his shoe yeah I love that that's your response yeah yeah that was me all right
3349060	3357460	Bradley yeah well I do get very angry at games sometimes I can't remember like any specific
3357460	3363620	really really big incidents I know throwing controllers all the time I was a kid good
3363620	3368100	thing about Genesis controllers is they're there you can always fix them pretty much
3368100	3374020	like Saturn controller there that I think that the round controller that wasn't Saturn
3374020	3379380	was it and there's one of them has the the shoulder button has like a magnet if you hit
3379380	3384020	it wrong it'll detach the magnet and you can't if you can't because it works with a magnet
3384020	3389580	somehow and so if it's not attached in the right place it won't work so that for that
3389580	3394900	and then I know last week when I was playing burnout revenge anytime was I screwing up
3394900	3401760	a bunch out yeah that would go screaming going oh fuck you god damn it it's so funny how
3401760	3407260	Nintendo like puts out this like very family-friendly system you know and it's like oh you know
3407260	3410820	oh we have to use friend codes so that children don't hear naughty language and did it up
3410820	3415100	but I remember back in the day in college playing Super Mario Kart in the dorms and
3415100	3419900	we would say the filthiest shit while playing that game like you know talking about each

3500300	3506020	that don't know what infamous is all about uh well I haven't actually played the game
3506020	3512380	so I don't really know a whole lot about the story but uh apparently um some world ending
3512380	3520060	between a warbird disaster strikes and hero appears by the name of coal and he has electrical
3520060	3526940	powers now what I want to talk about the second one is um how are they going to integrate
3526940	3536300	the uh um ice abilities into the uh gameplay mechanics because from what I played on the
3536300	3545620	um um sorry from what I played on the demo for the first one um everything just kind
3545620	3550460	of melded together for the electrical abilities so I'm just wondering how that would work

3699620	3706020	380 of our show a very long episode of that september the 5th 2010 where we are entering
3706020	3713380	hour 8 of our marathon we started at 2 and it's now 10 can't believe it all right and
3713380	3716340	it probably doesn't turn out that long in the podcast because we have been taking musical
3716340	3720660	breaks which some people might consider cheating but you know what we got to go to the bathroom
3720660	3724280	at some point we got to eat we got to you know just get up and stretch this room gets
3724280	3729240	kind of stuffy too so you know that's just how it works if you don't like it too bad
3729240	3736400	the show's free for god's sake stop complaining about free things you suck all right i should
3736400	3740480	say though um if you want to support free things you can always like leave us a nice
3740480	3744420	review on itunes or tell a couple people about the show you know that's what we always ask
3744420	3750020	just tell some friends and all that good stuff that's all we want all right um chat's asking
3750020	3754340	about chat fus can we do some chat if use are we gonna read some of those sure um go
3754340	3758240	ahead and send them and i'll read them in about 30 minutes sound good okay so send in
3758240	3763380	your uh fus over private message to dark sakura and she'll do chat fus and that's a first
3763380	3767320	for the podcast feed we don't have to do those in the podcast feed but just for you guys
3767320	3773160	because we love you we'll do them tonight how's that sound works for me all right awesome
3773160	3777620	meanwhile twitter we uh we never got around to uh doing the tweets that were sent us in
3777620	3781980	the last uh segment because i asked for some tweets and we got on tangents talking about
3781980	3787360	angry games and and the callers that we had and all that good stuff so uh i'm gonna try
3787360	3793680	to get to some tweets but i don't have the twitter music i can't do tweets without the
3793680	3800320	twitter music oh my gosh it's all i ruined everything we have to stop the marathon it's
3800320	3807000	done nose i'm kidding yeah when you were out getting pizza i deleted all of the native
3807000	3824520	olr music files they're gone you jerk all right i found it phew we love our twitter
3824520	3833400	oh uh to care a saying uh how is the final fantasy 14 beta isn't it just a prettier ff11
3833400	3837480	yeah pretty much it's ff11 with different combat and this whole guild left thing that
3837480	3841840	makes no sense to me whatsoever the biggest problem with final fantasy 11 is that it doesn't
3841840	3846240	hand hold you at all and like i i agree some games overdo it with the hand holding but
3846240	3849640	what was the most frustrating thing about final fantasy 11 the fact that it just plunked
3849640	3856960	you in the middle of a town and was like decay by the people yeah um so final fantasy 14
3856960	3862340	is it's the beta is really crowded i couldn't figure out what to do like i couldn't figure
3862340	3866040	out that there was like a whole nother map level i was supposed to go to and like activate
3866040	3870640	a switch like you would think the game would lead you through the first couple quests just
3870640	3874840	to kind of like give you a tutorial like you know about how the game works the interface
3874840	3878880	you know maybe it's because it's a beta not all of that's built in yet but i just the
3878880	3882320	beta left me feeling very frustrated and that's why i'm kind of laughing at all this like
3882320	3888320	closed betas or the open beta stuff going on is i'm like guys it's not worth your time
3888320	3892220	okay but hey it's a free game and at least you'll know if you can uh buy it when it comes
3892220	3896000	out or not but i honestly think the game is going to tank i think it's going to tank bad
3896000	3899560	especially for a final fantasy game like i think they're expecting it to do really well
3899560	3909080	it's not going to do nearly the business 13 did but we'll see um dj blaiskin said of several
3909080	3914040	tweets and usually i limit people to two tweets but hey it's the marathon why not so dj blaiskin
3914040	3920760	says what's cuter than a cat playing duck hunt nothing and sends us this uh tweet or
3920760	3925240	sorry an article via twitter and i actually did see this it's a video on youtube of a
3925240	3932480	kitty who's actually playing duck hunt and they start the game there and then the kid
3932480	3935720	this is terrible radio but i don't care and the cat see the cat's like scratching the
3935720	3941160	dog with her paws and oh i'm going for the next like attacking the ducks even though
3941160	3948760	they fly off screen it's adorable tell me that's not adorable it's adorable cats are
3948760	3956320	so damn cute uh let's see dj blaiskin says don't bother watching football this season
3956320	3960600	madden 11 already picked all the winners and lead us to a news story about how i guess
3960600	3964400	uh all the winners are already uh it's been determined because you know there's all the
3964400	3969400	statistics in madden and everything um the ravens and packers will be the conference
3969400	3976840	winners so there it is so i just i lol super bowl spoilers i think the football star that
3976840	3982640	actually is on the cover of madden has the madden curse so like if you're the guy who's
3982640	3988980	on the box the box art they have a horrible season after the game comes out i think that's
3988980	3992800	like a thing i don't know i don't follow it is i've heard that i've heard the same thing
3992800	3997640	they always get injured or something happens yeah who was on the cover this year i wasn't
3997640	4007200	paying attention was it brett farve people like him tiger woods david beckham that's
4007200	4015040	football right yes that's right it's david beckham it is all right um let's see dj blaiskin
4015040	4018160	sent us a story that we talked about in the very first hour of the marathon so i'm just
4018160	4021800	gonna assume you didn't hear it about microsoft raising the price of xbox live gold we'll
4021800	4029520	just pretend i didn't get that tweet um apparently super scribble knots is um there there's an
4029520	4034140	announcement about super scribble knots or whatever i don't know uh redertainment is
4034140	4040480	linking us to this story on twitter at mega 64 i guess they're excited because they're
4040480	4053800	in the game i don't they're actually in the game i guess good for them i don't whoopty
4053800	4059320	shit i mean whatever i got it i met them once at e3 a couple of them i don't know who it
4059320	4062840	was that i met because i had no idea who they were and they were really offended that i
4062840	4066680	didn't know who they were like we didn't know who they were and they were like offended
4066680	4071400	and i'm like get over yourself like you have some lulzy video game blog on the internet
4071400	4078680	like oh my god your dick is so powerful you know it's like god do you know who i am no
4078680	4084740	i don't expect people to know who i am but yay to them getting in a game i guess whatever
4084740	4089720	i guess now i i won't be able to get away from it i'll have to know who they are it
4089720	4094120	was i don't know if i should say this because this is get back to i won't i won't go into
4094120	4098840	it any further allegedly uh all right the word allegedly will always say oh come on

4104120	4108760	that's all i'm going to say all right but i think that's all of them isn't it like i
4108760	4114520	think i think in that video they were all large men with glasses weren't they i don't

4503960	4509520	video game of all time such a simple question that i don't know if it's been discussed here
4509520	4514840	on the show yet tonight guardian legend why you can't just say a name it's a chick that
4514840	4521560	turned into a plane and she shoots stuff and she fights giant eyeball creatures and tentacle
4521560	4527640	monsters and then the little the little freaking ball people from uh the adventure of lolo
4527640	4538080	are in it the end well said tgl bitches guardian legend bradley what is your favorite video
4538080	4564960	game of all time her um you can't pick two you're a cheater no okay fine you can pick
4564960	4572480	two maniac mansion okay why valkyrie profile because your mom i don't know don't give me
4572480	4575840	that look like i don't need a reason bitch like there's got to be something about the
4575840	4584560	game that you like right the art the music the story the unmatched combat no rpg is ever
4584560	4590840	really done what was the combat in valkyrie profile for those that don't know um it was
4590840	4600360	a weird hybrid of uh active time battle and um real time all right i had really insane
4600360	4606360	combos in it like street fighter why maniac mansion because it's iconic and it was the
4606360	4612320	first game that really brought um comedy into adventure gaming and it had a modern setting
4612320	4618440	as teenagers in present day whereas all adventure games up till then was like adventure or sci-fi
4618440	4622480	you know and they had the saturday morning show like later on didn't it when they're
4622480	4628280	like a saturday morning maniac mansion show or something i barely remember that i think
4628280	4634160	you're right though i'm almost positive there was did you actually play that through to
4634160	4638000	completion is it is it true you can beat it with every combination of characters or no
4638000	4646000	you can't can't do it with all of them there are hmm i know that there are two or three
4646000	4649720	characters that it's really preferred that you have at least one of them in there but
4649720	4653480	yeah i think you can beat it with all with any three wait here you go here you go look
4653480	4654480	at this blast in the past
4654480	4673360	this is live action yeah it was a live action show tv show oh my gosh i remember that it
4673360	4682320	was like almost like a drama the way the credits make it look like huh
4682320	4686760	let's see let me see if i can go oh it's created by eugene levee really let's see wait there's
4686760	4694800	a i think it ran for like three episodes before they pulled the plug on it

4699480	4703680	big baby blacks i can't fly for a minute if you know what i mean this is like a scene
4703680	4710040	out of twin peaks or something there she is this is creepy i don't like this all right
4710040	4715200	yeah this is upsetting is it ruining your memory of the show or is it ruining your memory
4715200	4721120	of the game is it making you like it has nothing to do with the game so all right yeah but
4721120	4728320	it said in the credits based on the lucas film game just so you know
4728320	4732400	you look like you're about to beat me with that microphone it's all right all right um

5643300	5648980	at some point in your game it'll be fun every once in a while we've done some drunk dnd nights
5648980	5657460	we've done two of those yeah so far and uh eddie has actually come to those so and one time we

5964900	5969780	broken the groups so we had to go to different vendors the very first thing we saw in my group
5969780	5975140	was a like a trailer of tons of different fatalities from the new moral combat game
5975140	5981220	and they were hilarious and any that you remember what any that you remember
5981220	5986740	oh yeah um there was one where reptile threw up in somebody's mouth like a whole bunch of acid
5986740	5994260	that was funny pick us up like that once actually there was one where sector like blew up somebody's
5994260	5999460	torso and like a few different pieces and as the pieces were flying at the air he locked onto each
5999460	6005620	individual piece and shot missiles at them so made them explode even more okay um there was one where
6005620	6011940	there was one where squirt can cut like i don't feel like right through the guy at the waistline
6011940	6016340	and he didn't fall over anything and then he cut the guy through the neck all the way through and
6016340	6021620	then he like kicked the torso so just the torso flew and then the head flew up and he took his
6021620	6027060	little knife and sliced the head in half i was like oh that's hilarious this is sounding like
6027060	6033060	a song what were the stage the stage ones did you see any of those no they didn't show any stage
6033060	6039380	ones but they did show um in the new uh acid pit place or old acid pit place i guess you would call
6039380	6045380	it um one of the background dudes that was hanging like you saw him get dipped into the acid he was
6045380	6049460	like screaming and freaking out and then they pulled him back up and he wasn't a skeleton he
6049460	6055620	was like this fleshy dead like dripping thing it was awesome that's fantastic rose was it like the
6055620	6063700	mortal kombat 2 um acid pit yeah yeah nice oh i want this game that that sounds hot they also
6063700	6071860	i don't know if this has come out yet but i don't care um because yeah they had tag team like uh
6071860	6076260	combo things like they do in like the marvel vs capcom game so you could be beating somebody up
6076260	6083300	and then tag in another partner and they'll jump right in oh wow yeah it was crazy cool that's
6083300	6088500	interesting so they stole that from uh marvel vs capcom it sounds like it's awesome yeah and i
6088500	6094660	don't know if any other games did it before but probably not um let's see what else was cool there
6094660	6104820	uh not a lot um no that was the coolest thing i think i saw which is kind of sad um i did get
6104820	6110260	to play Diablo 3 um i didn't know how to play it i tried to play it like wow and that got me killed
6110260	6115700	pretty quick and i was just like okay i'm done i give up it's cool i need to play it i understand
6115700	6120100	that i'm terrible at it and i won't buy it you're not gonna buy it diablo is awesome it's better
6120100	6124820	than i i like it better than starcraft i'm gonna get my i'm not buying for starcraft either but
6124820	6129700	if they give me a wild pet maybe and i'll get it well what have you been doing because i i know you
6129700	6135140	were able to get into the cata beta as well um what have you been doing in the cata beta um i
6135140	6142500	have played a warden up to 12 almost and then a goblin up to four because that's where the quest
6142500	6149060	is currently broken we can't proceed so the organs you know pretty cool the game doesn't feel like
6149060	6154020	wow i'll say that right now it does not feel like the same game we've been playing for so many years
6154020	6158580	um just going through the wargon and goblin experience but the wargons all depressing you
6158580	6164820	know we gotta save our home from these attacks oh my god we're gonna die and god was like
6164820	6171540	let me get some like bling glasses and i got running over people with my car and it's the best
6171540	6177540	love the goblin area so so much wasn't that the entire time wasn't that working quest with the
6177540	6183540	barrels uh on the abomination's heads like the best thing ever though i didn't know what to do
6183540	6187460	at first i was like i'm really close to this guy why am i not throwing the barrel no you have to
6187460	6192340	like get right up next to him but yeah that was pretty funny and i laughed at that stuff too it
6192340	6198740	was awesome um i'm gonna do a spoiler for the the wargon quest line uh you know whatever sure um
6198740	6203300	because it was there's a fun glitch that happened there's a part where you're fighting sylvanas
6203300	6208900	and uh like you're like the whole town is fighting sylvanas and she knocks you back and
6208900	6214900	she's about to shoot uh again graymane the leader of the wargon people uh with this poison arrow i
6214900	6221300	guess but instead his son jumps in front to take the arrow but when i played she was facing the
6221300	6228420	opposite direction so she shot like facing to the screen's left and the prince was right behind her
6228420	6234420	but it still killed and i was like that just ruins the mood interesting did you see the um part in
6234420	6238820	the wargon quest line where it's like we're gonna insert a movie here of you getting transformed
6238820	6244420	into a wargon or one of the characters says that i didn't see that part i just i just skipped over
6244420	6249220	it i think scroll back up a few times it's funny it's in the church yeah it's it's right and when
6249220	6252820	you transform when you go from the church to when you're in the gallows thing not to ruin it but
6252820	6256660	i did so oh yeah yeah i think there was one there but i didn't see anything on screen telling me
6256660	6262100	that something was going to happen i just i knew it was going to happen but no no yeah i don't
6262100	6266500	really care about my work immediately as much as i don't care about the goblin now because goblin is
6266500	6275540	so funny like the music is all like i don't know whimsical when you play it's a goblin and your
6275540	6284980	radio that goes only to uh 11. but yeah i like it it's it's not wow what we're used to but it's
6284980	6290420	it's neat it's the evolution of the game all right you haven't checked out any of the new areas yet
6290420	6293620	because that's what i'm waiting to do like i want my stupid character to copy over so i can check
6293620	6300740	out the new areas i i still can't get my character to copy over um i'm just i'm at dark shore now
6300740	6307380	i think that's why i'm at um so i'll get to see that area redone but no no character copying over
6307380	6314580	it's been keeping me a little sad no i was having the same problem what can you do all right well
6314580	6319540	uh if anyone here in the studio have questions for shane if not i'm gonna let him go and uh we're
6319540	6325140	gonna get back to our show sound good all right get back to our marathon marathoning all right
6325140	6332660	well any last thoughts for our listeners shane um yes uh you know like a month ago i wouldn't have
6332660	6338420	ever said this but i think i'm a huge microsoft down boy now why because of all the free stuff
6338420	6344020	they threw at us at conference and f you the sony and nintendo for not trying to win our affection
6344020	6350500	by giving us lots of free stuff so your loyalty can be bought yes so if i pay you like 20 you'll
6350500	6356980	wear like an orange lounge radio sticker to work uh i'll wear a sticker yeah like can i wear
6356980	6366820	stickers will you wear a shirt no i can't wear a shirt that says orange lounge tour fail um but

6408180	6414980	weaker years to the occult and a game like dnd fuels their imagination and makes them feel
6414980	6422500	special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of el diablo this afternoon the dead
6422500	6429700	ale wives watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session observe the previously

7277380	7282260	is a pretty epic song all right we gotta let you go please hurry up hurry up what's your last thought
7283540	7292980	um oh god no oh right um i tried well the work effort tried to activate like a trial account
7293860	7299700	and it won't work why not i got a little trial desk and everything it won't work what would you
7299700	7309620	do oh wow and everything won't log me in it's stupid call blizzard technical support the trial
7309620	7314420	accounts are so crippled because of people spammers use trial accounts so they can spam
7314420	7319220	without having to pay so the accounts are so crippled like when i played with a trial account
7319220	7323860	like two years ago i hated it because i couldn't do anything and then when i actually paid for it
7323860	7329620	it's like oh this is a completely different game so is it worth it for the 15 bucks because i
7329620	7334420	was in here in a whole lot i've known for your show but from every single last one of my friends
7334420	7341860	who has it been bragging all about oh i got level 80 blah blah blah and i've rolled this character
7342420	7349300	why aren't you playing i'm like uh i got a life and i play other games other than just
7349300	7354180	one i can't can i say this here real quickly about warcraft the reason why i play so much
7354180	7358660	warcraft is because the social element uh and you know a lot of my friends play and it's it's
7358660	7362420	so much fun to like raid with them and stuff and it's always fun to like meet new people too that
7362420	7366660	are that are like you and stuff first off two things apparently this has suddenly turned into
7366660	7371220	the robin allen guild radio show because one of the guild members who i've never seen join chat
7371220	7378580	before joined and said what do you mean allen has the best dps our bro joined and finally figured
7378580	7385380	out because i've been watching the guild the whole web series and i've finally figured out the whole
7385380	7390820	and some of the episodes and some of the lingo the thing is she really did play wow and that's
7390820	7396740	why i like that series is so spot on because i'm sure it's a lot like some of it is probably like
7396740	7400980	you know obviously fiction like some of the weird dating storylines to get into but a lot of the
7400980	7408820	stuff they talk about in game is so true and then i just i just got yourself in the south park make
7408820	7415700	laws not warcraft episode ma'am bathroom and this is uh i just got a screenshot from one of the
7415700	7422500	guild members who apparently yes in guild chat at uh at 1 56 a.m i'm assuming that's eastern time
7422500	7425860	uh one of the guildies said that bitch ain't coming to raid tomorrow because he's going to
7425860	7429060	get pink berry that fat bitch i just got a screenshot of somebody talking shit about me
7429060	7435140	and guild wow rob if it's one i know i know they're they're listening to if it's one something that
7435140	7441060	would be central time actually one of my girlfriends ended up breaking up with me via wi-fi connection
7441060	7448420	on a live metroid time hunters game where we could do voice chat we had friend codes everyone in the
7448420	7458900	whole room heard it and then my character died i was just like wow um worst breakup ever i uh
7458900	7465860	i whatever happened like a phone call like like text messages break up how how okay you have to
7465860	7472500	explain that better like what what what did she do she she just came on the vo ip or whatever was
7472500	7477940	like um i you know i i want to kill you a couple more times in metroid and by the way i hate you
7477940	7485540	and i don't want to see you again basically it was because i was a gamer and so she she said
7485540	7491540	she said either you quit gaming or i dumped you and get this this girl was a cheerleader and
7491540	7498100	freshman and i was kind of done with my life trying to find love well you know what if i had
7498100	7501700	the hot shirt cheerleaders you know what if there's one lesson we could teach you here on orange
7501700	7506340	lingerie to look i want i want all the young men to listen up because i know we have you know some
7506340	7511220	some strapping young lads that are what between like 16 and 21 that listen to the show young guys

7515300	7519940	be back me up on this is that if a woman is going to break up with you because you play too many
7519940	7529140	games she's a bitch yes she's a bitch and you can do better and that's just i'm dating a girl who

7795060	7801140	strong with a good scoop of a hershey's cocoa in it and then i add some splenda and uh back
7801140	7809140	about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and use a soy creamer after i add the water this actually

7829940	7834900	doing uh listless it's cheating though if i play too much music like playing about 10 minutes every
7834900	7838340	hour that's that's okay because we needed to be able to take breaks and stuff but if i play much
7838340	7842820	more than that we're cheating all right uh bradley hi we're going to be doing a listless here shortly
7842820	7846420	tonight's topic if you want to start thinking about this and i know bradley's gonna want to
7846420	7854900	think about this he needs to get his list together okay um would be uh the topic tonight thing i most
7854900	7861220	want to see in the olr olr marathon 2011 okay it's going to be the topic tonight so start thinking
7861220	7866500	about that get your list down okay thing i most want to see in the olr marathon 2011 all right
7867140	7874020	um meanwhile more facebook questions that we uh got earlier this week um we had liam earlier ask
7874020	7878820	us what is our favorite video game of all time what about this uh john on facebook asked a very
7878820	7886340	similar question not just what is the best video game ever what is the worst video game ever is
7886340	7892180	there a game that you can think of that would qualify as the worst video game ever dark soccer
7892180	7898420	there was a game that was so bad that when dan and i rented it we were horrified by it and called
7898420	7906260	blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back and it was wcw thunder that bad huh it was
7906260	7912580	really that bad and you know i actually kind of thought the spice girls game was bad but it's so
7912580	7919860	hilarious it was hilarious come on kind of hard to play it was awesome and the american blue stinger
7919860	7926020	was bad the japanese one was cool all right worst game ever alan you got something um
7928100	7933380	probably that king's quest mask of eternity game because i bought it the day it came out for full
7933380	7940820	retail prize which was like 50 bucks and it is hideously awful bad terra bad terra bad
7942980	7949620	um i would uh what is the worst video game ever fusion frenzy 2 is probably the worst video game
7950420	7954980	one of them it's close uh that was that one i made you play on the 360 that was so so bad like
7954980	7960820	it was like mario party but not fun at all was like when you had me play yaris i couldn't help
7960820	7965780	it because i was laughing i was just laughing just laughter came out of me playing yaris
7965780	7972900	because it was so what is this i do not even so that's that's worth something um and and bit boy
7972900	7977380	was really a special kind of terrible that i played earlier um this year too that was really
7977380	7983620	bad or last year uh and um going like if i want to go way back okay i remember renting this game
7983620	7986900	on the nintendo entertainment system and thinking it was just like the worst fucking game i'd ever
7986900	7991300	played and i bet nobody's ever even heard of it it was a color dreams game okay they made
7991300	7996740	they made the bootleg carts it was called master chew and the drunk nerd who and i remember this
7996740	8001700	game because it was so terrible i bet that's a game not even jamie knows like that's how obscure
8001700	8007380	this show huh no i've seen it have you it's bad it's bad it's really bad a lot of those color
8007380	8012180	dreams were really bad yeah yeah good stuff bradley any terra bad games you can think of
8012180	8018260	uh worst freaking video game uh the worst a lot of them that are really terrible are like these
8018260	8023060	girl fighting games on like the japanese saturn ones i don't think like ask i don't know if it's
8023060	8028820	like oscar 120 was actually fun i'm thinking of like one of them they might have been a different
8028820	8034900	one from that one but usually they're slow and they make crappy moves and stuff uh with other
8034900	8042580	games were craptastic let's see some of our uh chat room uh saying uh ddr dollar bill says silent
8042580	8047380	assault was another color dreams game that was worse green dragon says princess tomato in the
8047380	8051700	salad kingdom the forest you had to get through was a bigger pain in the ass than the doom dungeon
8052260	8061380	uh let's see uh dash of destruction yaris kabuki warriors says amaze satsuma was a really bad game
8061380	8068420	sir dorks a lot says the ps1 version of samurai showdown 3 was terrible there you go those are
8068420	8075780	some of the responses there from our chat room more facebook questions uh john on facebook also
8075780	8083940	asks the the best geek moment ever this is a good one the best geek moment ever what was your like
8083940	8091140	best geek moment ever this is kind of tricky oh mine's easy that's uh beating the dragon blindfold
8091140	8099140	did in mega man 2 that is pretty geeky and and uh doing you know doing mario ate one blindfolded
8099780	8107060	if if you know your rhythm it's not that hard but the dragon because and that one was also
8107060	8116260	kind of precise timing too so i i've only done it three times nice i can't do it now hell no
8116260	8122820	but when when it was out yeah okay all right alan do you have a best geek moment ever that you can
8122820	8129700	think of not right now all right now i would say mine was probably my first e3 walking through the
8129700	8134580	doors of my first e3 it was kind of like oh this is what i've read about in gaming magazines for
8134580	8139780	so long and i'm actually here and oh my god and then i realized everything was really overpriced
8139780	8145620	and all the lines were long but it was still a pretty cool experience um i thought though
8145620	8149780	this year's e3 was like a close second you know you're my first e3 was definitely my best but
8149780	8153940	this year's e3 was a close second this is a really good e3 this year so what about though
8153940	8159460	going to e3 for the first time is press um that was cool too but i honestly didn't notice that
8159460	8162900	huge of a difference because one thing i've learned about press is that if you don't book
8162900	8166740	your show like six months in advance then you're pretty much having the same show as everyone else
8167780	8173700	plus back in oh six or oh seven i don't remember what year we actually went as press maybe it was
8173700	8177940	oh seven i booked us with bethesda well in advance so we could get in for the star trek screening
8177940	8182580	yeah which ended up being a mediocre game which was too bad yeah and i got into though i got him
8182580	8187940	one time as not as pressed though for a press thing for public cross no i'm sorry for to steal
8187940	8192660	your thunder oh that's okay but it was it was good um yeah there were some really good parties
8192660	8197380	depending on uh what year it was you know uh looking in our chat room and some of the questions
8197380	8202660	uh questions here uh jv mon says my best geek moment was meeting matt smith at the new york
8202660	8207380	city premiere of doctor who series 5 and being on the 13th episode of doctor who confidential
8208580	8214660	uh rama says beating mega man 3 dan shadow says the parties at e3 were insane yep yep
8215700	8220980	what was that place that we went and got beer at they had like 200 anywhere 200 taps on the
8220980	8226180	wall or something like that that place was oh seattle those packs for packs that was epic yes
8226180	8231060	maybe some people are there right now although you know i did enjoy my uh my facebook style photo
8231060	8243620	with jonathan colton that was pretty fun all right um i've got one oh yes uh at anime expo
8243620	8249540	2000 this is like jamie says you must remember seeing me there it was that was my last day x
8249540	8255380	yeah yeah uh actually stayed up all night uh at the ddr room i didn't i think i only played it
8255380	8259060	once there but i was just they were watching people because i was waiting for that there's
8259060	8263380	like they were having like signings in the morning at disneyland wasn't it was it 2001
8263380	8267700	at disneyland because then i was there for one after that uh can't remember if that was a long
8267700	8273620	beach winner in disneyland one it wasn't no it hadn't been long beach no no the 2000 was the one
8273620	8280100	at disneyland 2001 was yeah it was at an aheim okay it was one with like a long pier down there
8280100	8284580	we went down there and waited yeah so yeah basically stay up all night watching people play
8284580	8290980	ddr waiting to get signatures from like artists and stuff that's pretty geeky staying up all
8290980	8296980	night to play ddr that was a day charging two dollars a play on a third mix i mostly was just
8296980	8301860	watching because i only played like once because that was the first time i'd ever seen it so it
8301860	8307700	was just kind of interesting to watch then then once i found the ddr usa and at roseville golf
8307700	8313300	land then and then i the obsession began that was the year of the chair here's some more geek
8313300	8317620	moments from chat green dragon says biggest geek moment speaking cling on with my dad
8317620	8325060	dude your dad is cool uh let's see uh gilroy spars which i think is nathan says uh being told about
8325060	8329700	a weekend cabin retreat of drinking and massive dnd playing and being very excited about going
8329700	8333380	that does sound kind of awesome but you have to actually go for it to be a geek moment just you
8333380	8340580	know uh ben jamus a friend of mine irl who's listening says meeting robocop at an la kings
8340580	8346420	game so by the way actually my friend ben is is also jewish dark sakura and i'm supposed to tell
8346420	8351860	you la shana tova is that that that pretty much means have a good year because russia shana is
8351860	8357300	this uh oh there you go wednesday night slash thursday during the day i got it's like i'm i'm
8357300	8362580	like the translator of like jew speak tonight or something i don't know it's just hebrew rob
8362580	8368100	i thought of my geek moment you thought of your geek moment yay um when i was in dmla which was
8368100	8374180	the youth group that i was in uh oh boy we went all right i'm gonna out myself i was in it too
8374180	8377940	and the reason i haven't talked about a lot of the show because not a lot of kids were in it
8377940	8382820	like it's not it's it's youth masonry right so it's like not a lot of the masons before their
8382820	8387140	son usually if your grandpa's in it or you're like in my case you end up being in it you have friends
8387140	8392340	that were in it or what have you but um the the reason why i bring this up before he he says this
8392340	8397540	is um because alan and i were both in this organization so we're convinced that we met
8397540	8402580	each other when we were 15 like at camp at the leadership camp or whatever like we're convinced
8402580	8409540	we met each other and just didn't like you know we weren't really like neither of us were practicing
8409540	8413940	homosexuals at the time and yeah so you know just it was i was like i know i was like magically
8413940	8418020	gathering cards exactly yeah me too i'd be like let's talk about new super nintendo which is
8418020	8421700	weird that we wouldn't have met because we would have had all those same interests like now going
8421700	8426340	but it's just weird i don't know so at the convention which is basically like four days
8426340	8430900	of a bunch of 15 year old boys just staying up and doing convention things i think we hooked up a
8431620	8437380	super ness up to our hotel route tv room and we played i think we played rock and roll racing
8437380	8444340	and street fighter 2 i think for like 36 hours without sleeping oh my god which is something
8444340	8453300	that you can only do when you're 15 i beg to differ oh i beg to differ okay when i it was
8453300	8458740	probably my i'd have to say my second year of college or my first year somewhere around there
8458740	8462980	i was working in the game room and so i brought in my tv and my super nintendo and my friend
8462980	8469700	brought in his import saturn and we had gaming going on in the pool hall all night and i ran dnd
8469700	8474340	games and we did this three nights in a row and i did not sleep and on the fourth day of having
8474340	8480660	been awake i was i sit down at my friend's dorm room and lean back on the cushions while they're
8480660	8487940	playing um whatever i think it was doom at the time and wake up in my own dorm bed oh so they
8487940	8494740	carried you they carried me to my dorm room don't remember any of it don't remember but i'm sorry
8494740	8499540	but the best like dorm slash frat house story that you possibly have was when you missed this show
8499540	8504020	because you were in san diego one weekend and you stayed at the gay frat house can you tell this
8504020	8510980	story again on the show real quick right it's been years i um i went with julie to uh san diego to
8510980	8516180	see um some friends of ours um who one of them lives in japan right now and the other one lives
8516180	8521700	somewhere in town i think now he moved up here he used to be julie's roommate for a while anyway um
8522900	8529460	we uh there was like hardly anywhere else to stay and so the only place i got to stay was this
8529460	8536260	little cot under the stairs it was a little room how did you end up going to a gay frat house as
8536260	8541620	your hotel because the only place that we had to stay was the gay frat house to stay with our
8541620	8546580	friends oh your friend was a gay frat boy yeah okay he lived in the frat house okay so the only
8546580	8552580	spaces like julie slept on i think on some couch and i slept in a little room under the stairs
8552580	8557220	where there had been a mattress it's like the harry potter room we caught that's what he called
8557220	8561780	it the harry potter room and so it had like a little light in there all on its own and
8561780	8566260	everything it was actually kind of neat um i'm very very glad they washed the mattress before
8566260	8569780	i used it i know i was just like think about all the hand jobs have taken place in that little
8569780	8574580	closet all right bro i'm so drunk bro bro where are we at bro
8578100	8584500	sorry but it was it was a fun visit though because we went to extraordinary dessert which is this
8584500	8594020	gourmet dessert shop in san francisco and like amazing stuff and um went to uh julie in california
8594020	8599620	up in the mountains um kind of a little touristy town but it was the first place i ever had buffalo
8599620	8606660	burgers and i came back on i slept in the harry potter room rob i read harry potter in the harry
8606660	8614500	potter room and i was like wait there's gay frat houses like i didn't even know there's like a
8614500	8618740	gay fraternity no i know that now but like 10 years ago i didn't remember however long ago that
8618740	8626500	was all right all that long time ago oh no it's been a long time all right uh redertainment is
8626500	8634580	falling up saying bro don't stop doing that i need to get something else to drink all right
8634580	8641540	um let's see should we move on to another question here uh yes uh another question from john on
8641540	8650580	facebook says the best and worst game tie-ins i.e movies tv so forth although i guess i could
8650580	8657220	go on to like action figures and all that good stuff so the best and the worst tie-ins um
8658340	8662260	i think honestly the best as far as like movies and all that go the silent hill movie was pretty
8662260	8667220	kick-ass like it's even though it wasn't like perfect it was still like miles above anything
8667220	8671540	else i think has come out to this point so um the silent hill movie is probably one of the best
8672100	8678900	um as far as the worst that maniac mansion shows up there that's that was pretty bad or um
8678900	8683140	maybe the pac-man cartoon in the 80s was was not that great either like it really didn't
8683860	8688340	i don't know it didn't didn't work for me i don't know the best and the worst video game
8688340	8694340	tie-ins dark sakura like movie tv best was silent hill i have to agree with you there and you know
8694340	8697220	how many times i've watched it and i bought it on blu-ray because i'm a fucking addict
8698180	8708500	saw it four times in the theater um worst captain n because the characterizations in that were just
8708500	8717780	so awful they were hideous and um i also have to say the the street fighter movie with john
8717780	8723700	claudia van damme poor ral julia having that this is last movie but kali minnow was hot
8728500	8736260	any uh alan about uh captain n yeah jane brought it up i love that show now when i think back on it
8736260	8741380	why did kick kid ikaris always suffix everything he said with ikis like that was his speech
8741380	8746100	impediment what was that well and maybe i was mega this mega that and simon belmont was an idiot and
8746100	8754340	he was supposed to be like this courageous vampire hunter yeah idk idk best video game tie-in super
8754340	8762500	mario brothers cereal because you like food yeah i would no i would eat all that's funny no um
8763300	8768660	i would pick out all the marshmallows and then eat save the dry cereal for later the one the
8768660	8773860	whatever the nintendo cereal had the two sides it was like two bags in one box the nintendo
8773860	8780820	breakfast cereal system yeah yeah okay that worst uh
8783700	8790180	i had one i blanked oh tired live radio i know i'm yawning we haven't even gotten to the games yet
8790180	8793380	we had to get to that segment pretty soon well let me know if you think about it okay bradley
8793380	8797860	i don't know if you have anything you're thinking of best and worst video game tie-ins can't really
8797860	8805540	think anything any and all of the marketing related to dante's inferno last year oh that
8805540	8811220	whole debacle tie-ins ever oh what was so terrible about it like see what you can get away with with
8811220	8818420	a booth babe or like or maybe tied for god of war 2 when they served like a goat or something at the
8818420	8822820	press conference and they have the girls in the togas of course it was a fake animal right but
8822820	8827700	they're like oh yeah we have a dead goat for god of war 2 no that's dumb and you're a bad person
8827700	8834340	for thinking of it yeah sony just in general has a lot of really bad tie-ins like sometimes they do
8834340	8837780	really well like the kevin butler stuff but sometimes they do really bad like remember the
8837780	8843060	black and white psp oh yeah oh that was not not good like you just feel secondhand embarrassment
8843060	8850340	for them right or the psp commercial with the squirrels yes all right how about a game to perk
8850340	8862020	us up everybody how about an olr game yay tonight folks we're going to play a game called listless

10202900	10208260	following four years ago basically pretty no yeah around that pretty no
10208260	10216100	no what is a pretty no is that like my priorities right now aside from having
10216100	10223060	you know tending to my girlfriend and other things in life yeah so i mean i do play but not as much
10223060	10228820	as i used to and that's that's due to age like i'm getting you know i'm getting pretty old now
10229700	10235860	new york city scene is on on its way out kind of almost dead at this point so we go to new jersey
10235860	10242260	now you got a girlfriend now yeah i've been i've been in a relationship since april oh my gosh

10257860	10264580	crap once in a while all right um but okay so the new york scene is dying i'm sorry to hear that but
10264580	10267620	hey at least you're at least you're getting laid so it all's good with the world right
10268980	10275940	pretty much i mean you know as i said ddr is like it's not as big as it used to be here but
10275940	10282580	whatever we still play somewhat i try to avoid cf like the plague back home in new york coney
10282580	10289140	island's pretty coney island scene is pretty much a you know the wasteland at this point i hate to
10289140	10294340	say it but everyone's going out to either like deep parts of queens or new jersey to play wasn't
10294340	10298900	coney island supposed to get like this huge makeover like like now or something like they're
10298900	10304900	going to reopen it even then luna park doesn't have arcades oh that's a problem all the other
10304900	10310420	arcades i mean the other they used to be an arcade they used to have ddr but it burned down this you
10310420	10316580	know this this past year so i don't know whether they'll have ddr when they rebuild all the other
10316580	10323780	places are pretty much the same i mean it's like i i can't think of any good places to play now
10323780	10329300	even the one that we had in queens basically the mall kicked them out so they got sent further
10329300	10337140	into long island i know it's it's bullshit now i usually go out to like bay tide you know peter

10512420	10515940	there you go i brought a bunch of psp and ds games that are still in the car
10515940	10518740	did you because i didn't know what we were gonna do today i i didn't either
10519940	10524660	i i just showed up they're still in the car hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
10524660	10532020	hey hello hello hey this is the ddr dollar bill ddr dollar bill what's up $50 bill
10533860	10540020	nothing much it's like three of them half a loopy so join the club you'll be a perfect
10540020	10545380	fit for our show what's on your mind buddy not much i was wanting to call earlier i think uh
10545380	10550420	zacker said about uh going older and not playing games too much and ddr just fading out
10550420	10555060	man i took care of that i mean there's like there's next to no places to play the art anymore
10555060	10559380	and even i stopped playing and i just got i didn't get bored of it i just got tired of all
10559380	10564740	these new kids coming around causing crap and everything you know it it stopped becoming fun
10564740	10569780	i'm interested in some of this resurgence that's coming up namely dance central and dance masters
10569780	10573060	and part of the reason that interests me is because it's very different like it's a whole
10573060	10577380	new way to kind of play a dance game it's not just stomping on a mat and the song list for dance
10577380	10581380	central like i love the fact that both these games exist because there's truly something
10581380	10586180	for everyone there's dance central for those folks that really want something in the mainstream and
10586180	10590580	like their you know music to be in the mainstream and top 40 and then for folks that have really
10590580	10594980	grown up on the you know bamani hits from japan there's dance masters i really think there's
10594980	10598900	something for everyone on connect and i it's kind of exciting where that that's going and it almost
10598900	10605620	makes me like excited about music games again is that game ddr no but you know ddr is a great
10605620	10613380	no but you know ddr has been around since 1998 it's it's it's been an epically long series it's
10613380	10618500	it's okay for it to be dying out right about now you know i'm not disagreeing with that i you know
10618500	10623780	i don't mind it dying out because it's you know forever but my only thing with the two dance games
10623780	10628660	that i was thinking about when i actually saw it was one both of them i would actually like
10628660	10633860	to see something where you can make your own choreography not just follow what they have
10633860	10640020	on screen like everything seems to be set to so you pick one song you follow that choreography
10640020	10646340	for that song and never changes and i kind of want to see because they have it's the way it
10646340	10652180	looks like it's that they're broken to sections so you have a four four beat for one step maybe two
10652180	10655780	two beats for another step you know you kind of like put it together the way it looks in the
10655780	10661300	commercials you know versus us whatever and the way i'm thinking is if there is some way maybe
10661300	10666100	to shuffle something around so you can kind of make your own choreography to the song your own
10666100	10670980	version to it i mean that's one way i'm thinking it would actually make the game a little better
10670980	10678580	because otherwise i mean i could see being good but at the same time i don't know it just seems
10678580	10683300	it just seems kind of too limited i honestly honestly think that dance masters is the future
10683300	10687860	of ddr like i think that's where konami's put in their stock is this whole connect thing and if it
10687860	10693620	takes off you're going to see something like it in arcades too man i hope so i mean if they fix
10693620	10699300	the lag and connect in the connect yeah this will definitely take off like crazy and i can even see
10699300	10703620	dance schools utilizing this we'll see all right buddy i'm going to let you go to get some more
10703620	10707700	calls but thanks so much for the call okay i'll get some coffee see you later all right good luck
10709460	10713060	all right we'll try and get some more calls in now one eight seven seven game olr or our username on

10722260	10725300	least get a couple more calls in if there's still people interested in calling so we'll give it a
10725300	10728740	couple more minutes one eight seven seven game olr our username is skype is orange laundry

10749540	10756340	i got a ride home that night but still i see all right well i sometimes you need to make the
10756340	10761700	emergency walmart run i suppose although i don't know like i i wish they had 24-hour targets and
10761700	10767700	yes i i realize like i'm supposed to be boycotting target apparently but i don't i can't like they're
10767700	10772580	less evil than walmart yes they're it's it's the lesser of two evils still they could donate
10772580	10777700	another 150 000 whatever organization it still is less evil than walmart in my book but i'm just
10777700	10784740	i'm i'm a hippie like that whatever so well anything uh what about games and stuff any

12364340	12370020	process i would i would die it'd be over yeah what's ever going to happen if that drive died
