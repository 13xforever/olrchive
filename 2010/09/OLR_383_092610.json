{"text": " Today, September 26th, 2010, a new mini-game is found in Halo Reach, the classic video game show is rated by the ESRB. What website will bribe you with Microsoft Points to use it? Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice. We tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, www.allgames.com to listen live. My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over, I forgot my name for a minute there, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Crunchy. How are you? Crunchy. Good. Crunchy the Bagel Queen. Okay, can that be your new name tonight? Crunchy the Bagel Queen? No. Please? No. Okay. Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki. Hello. How are you doing Tech Master Loki? I'm doing fine. Good. See, I remembered your guys' names even though Crunchy the Bagel Queen wants to go buy something else tonight. Alright, also, I just got the finger, alright. Also say hello to special guests we have in the studio tonight. In fact, they had so much fun last week, they're back for more, suckers. Say hello to the Doctor and, okay, and Rice Princess. I like that you're psychic to the point where you can't remember your own name. That's wonderful. Okay, she's referencing a phone call we just, okay, every week on the, just for those that only download the podcast and don't listen live, every week we do a phone call before the show is live with Bobby Blackwolf, the gentleman who does the show before us. And I don't know, I claim to have ESP or something, but Loki was actually reading Bobby's mind, not mine. I don't know. It was dumb. Like even repeating the story is really dumb. Wouldn't that mean I have ESP? That's because you're psycho and have ESPN. This is really, really dumb. For real. For real, real. For real. Alright. Rob, it's for reals, okay. Chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you want to join us live and chat with us tonight. You got a fan in chat, Darkisque's in chat saying, Rice Princess, we loves you. Aw, thanks. I love you too, whoever you are. You don't even know him. No, I really don't. But thank you. I like you too. Rama says, I thought tonight was a repeat as many times as Jamie said crunchy lol. No, it's, we're live here on this lovely September evening of 2008, no, I'm kidding. Alright. It's 2010 of course, we're live and we're going to talk about all the latest and greatest in video games and all that. But of course we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week? Dark Sakura? Crunchy the bagel queen? How was your, how was your gaming week? I love Plants vs. Zombies a lot. Like I was supposed to go to bed at midnight a couple nights ago, so I was going to Apple Hill on the weekend. Okay, your mic is full of fail. You gotta grab it. Okay. I got it. Alright. Nothing ever. I had to go to bed early one night and cause we were going to Apple Hill the next day, which is awesome and has lots of apple juice. Apple Hill's awesome. Yes. Anyway, um, but instead of going to bed on time when I was supposed to, I was up for three hours playing Plants vs. Zombies and didn't even realize how late I was up playing Plants vs. Zombies and did it again yesterday. And I love that game. Plants vs. Zombies is freaking rad and then I played some Final Fantasy 13. How many times can this dude say hero? For those of, you know, our listeners that aren't local to the Sacramento area, Apple Hill is a place a little bit up, um, I guess a little Eastern from us, um, it's Camino California up the hill, I guess if you will, um, where they have a lot of apples and crafts and stuff and, um, I mean the apple cider's awesome, but apple cider's, you know, awesome all the time, but it's crafts. No, they have lots of good organic markets there. And a corn maze. But, but, they don't have a corn maze. They're just no corn. Is that a maze maze? They had a corn maze when I went there like years ago, like 10 years ago. Well I had never been, okay? I'm from Alabama where we have stuff like swamps. Um, swamp hill, but they've got craft, the blueberry swamp is, there was a place there that had a really good lamb burger of which I got lamb burger juice all over my hands and wiped it off on a lamb. Is there, is there a lamb? That is sick. PETA is going to be calling any minute now. Here's your sister. Come here. That's gross. And for the record, I went shopping at the organic market up there and I picked heirloom tomatoes, fell down the hill. My knee looks better than it did. You took a tumble down apple hill. Well, it was funny is that this is the awesome part. This was the awesome part was that I, uh, when I fell on my knees, I really bruised up my knee really bad, but I did not tear my jeans. So you were a bruised apple hill. She peels. I'll be here all night, everybody. But a bump. Don't forget to tip your waitress. Okay. Indeed. So I love how your gaming week is like, yeah, I play plan for zombies and a little more fun fancy 13 and Oh my God, apples, apples, apples, apples, apples, and I'm not talking max. I got fudge. Oh, congrats. They do have an apple cider milkshake. That's pretty good though. We had lunch at the place has had the apple milkshakes and it's so good video games are pretty cool. Let's go to apple hill and pack some fudge. Just like crunchy, the bagel queen. We don't need to go to apple hill to do that. All right. All right. You guys have earned it. Hold on. What I love is that your mic is so crappy. It won't pick that thing up. Anyway. All right. My mic is not crappy. It's the swear bear in you have a swear bear. What is a swear bear? It's a bear that makes really obscene comments and it has two different settings on the back of it has a switch, which I thought was an on off switch and for the longest time kept saying kiss my ass instead of like all the, instead of all the wonderful things he normally says, but like he will say of course kiss my ass and he'll say, um, eat shit and die motherfucker, you know, but I have it on my desk and it just, it's a really cute looking bear that says, hug me or press press me and like it's chest and some people are like, Oh, it's a bear. What the fuck did they just say to me? I know. Seriously. Why do we not have a swear bear here in the studio? I will bring it in next week. You know what? I'm not going to be here next week. So I think that's too bad. Why don't you have the swear? Why don't you have the swear bear sit in for me next week? I'm sorry. I ate it. Okay. So. Sure. Loki. How was your gaming week? Um, it was pretty brief cause I don't have a lot of time and place of at home, but, um, you know, I've been playing a lot of iPod games and stuff. Uh, well, okay. Really only one iPod game and playing plants versus zombies. Uh, I can't help it. It's so addicting. Um, but yeah, it's, it's an awesome game, so you should get it really on any platform that you can. Um, then also of course more grand theft auto and that was pretty much it. It's, I don't know. It's fun. We went back, like I said, to, uh, the Lost and Damned expansion and, um, I kinda, I kinda missed the old, uh, open world actual death matches and stuff instead of being confined to a really small portion of the map. So it's kinda nice to do that and we're gonna be modding it again soon. So we'll be back to the incredible games that we used to play. Um, and then since she brought up something completely unrelated to the games, I thought I'd bring something up that, you know, totally missed the boat on, like, years ago when it came out. But, um, this morning I actually watched that movie, uh, Shoot Em Up. That movie is fucking crazy. Oh, I don't know. Um, I've never seen a person kill more people with a carrot than, you know, in that movie. He, he murdered literally, like, 12 to 15 people with a carrot. It didn't, like, break at any point? No, different carrots. Oh. He, like, you know, shoved one through a guy's throat. He stabbed a person in the eye with a carrot. It was just, it was so, the movie, it, from the beginning, was just so over the top. What the fuck movie is this? It's with, um, oh, what the fuck is his name, uh. That actor that nobody knows. I don't know. Yeah, I can't think of any. That guy who did that thing in that place. Yeah. But no, it's a really, um, really just over the top movie. If they spend, like, two minutes where it's just kinda, okay, normal, and then it's just, like, boom, all action, just all the time. Like, over the top. Over the top action. Just gratuitous. They're having sex in a gunfight at the same time. I mean, there's, oh, there, there's parts where he is, um, he was doing something with a baby. Oh. Oh my. Shoot Em Up is a 2007 action film starring Clive Owen, Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Bellucci. She was the hot chick in The Matrix, huh? And she was the hot chick in that movie, too. She was a, she was a lactating prostitute that he brought the baby to, to feed. Wow. Sounds like a real family fun film. No, it's awesome, though. Seriously, it is, like, such an awesome movie, and I do idolize the fact that he killed people that annoyed him. Like, he's all, you know, my pet pet, like, there's, like, one part, after a gunfight, they're, like, getting away from these bad guys, and this guy cuts them off without, you know, he's merged lanes without signaling. So he chased the guy down, slammed him off the road, and then, you know, made him get in a car accident. There was some other guy that was slurping a, you know, milkshake, he shot the milkshake. Another guy that had, like, really nasty-looking toenails, so he blew off his toes. Of course, they were holding up. I could have swore that Loki said, let's talk about actual video games this week. Yeah, but then he said. I did! For, like, five seconds. This is his Apple Hill moment. Just give it to him, Rob. Geez. No, seriously, I mean, I totally missed this when it came out in theaters, but, you know, it was, like, on DVD and Blu-ray and stuff like that, until it was on, you know, cable TV. No, seriously, it's such an awesome movie. Just way over the top. I don't understand why it didn't do better than it did in the box office, because it was just such a crazy movie. If I'm understanding this correctly, he's killing anyone that even slightly annoys him? Like, there's no anger issues at all in this movie. Not everybody, but, like, usually it's like, you know, just, I don't know, it's just lots of funny one-liners in there, and just really ridiculous stuff, you know, at one point he gets both of his thumbs broken, and he's, like, firing the gun in really weird ways. He uses the carrot a lot, like, he uses the carrot to fire the gun, he jams a carrot into the trigger of an Uzi and throws the Uzi, like, at the bad guys, and it's just, it's so ridiculous. Oh, there's one scene in the warehouse where he rigs this elaborate pulley system with all these guns, and, like, they're coming after him, he's watching them on security cameras and firing different guns in remote places, it's just ridiculous, but it would make such an awesome video game. Yeah, and this is called when? And that's how we bring it back. And this is called again? Shoot Em Up. Shoot Em Up. That sounds like a lot of video games, actually. No, seriously, I think it was, like, one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen. I mean, I think it even surpasses, like, Wanted for me, you know, because Wanted I thought was a pretty awesome action movie, but this is just ridiculous. This is, like, big hit ridiculous and then some. I love the big hit. Oh, that movie is ridiculous. All right, wow. Back to Shoot Em Up Radio. I have a torrent ready. Okay. I mean, I have a YouTube clips of it ready. Of course. My Gaming Week. Today, I actually played Plants vs. Zombies. I'm not even kidding. I played for, like, five minutes. Oh, wow, is there an echo in the room? Um, yeah. Other games I played this week. I played a little more of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light because I hadn't really played it since the week it came out and I was like, oh, I want to beat more of it because it's such a cool game. So I want to play more of that. So I did. What? What's that? Sorry. I remembered another game I played. Is she just going to cut me off for your game? I see how it is. Sorry. Well, you mentioned you made me think about it. Fine. What? Droplets. The hell's that? It's a little puzzle game on Steam. $2. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You know what? I've got to go play that, too, because I got gifted a copy of that. Yeah. So I got to check that out. I just didn't this week. You should think about- It's actually fun. I'll check it out. I've heard good things about it. You should think about fitting Earthbound into there somewhere, Rob. At some point. Yes. I know. Yes. You're a little behind, like, many years. Stop. And, let's see, I played World of Warcraft a lot because it's awesome. Dork. Shut up. You played, too. Shut up. I played something new. I played Need for Speed World, which is the free MMO, because it's free. It's an MMO? It's a free Need for Speed MMO. It came up on the show a couple of weeks ago. I have to know. What do you do? Do you just race against people? To be honest, it really isn't much different from a Need for Speed game on, like, Xbox 360. At least that's how it felt to me, is just that, you know, other people would show up in races. It was like, okay, you remember Test Drive on the 360? I don't know if you ever played it, but you would just see other people as you're driving by in the world. Like you'd just kind of drive by them and there'd be, like, actual people on their 360s out on the road that you'd be driving by. Except none of them were me, because if they were me, I'd be driving off-road because that's all I did with those cars. Well, you sometimes see people doing that, too. It's pretty much like that, but, like, it's kind of such a clusterfuck that, like, in the first couple, like, I guess around a race or something, there's no collision detection because, like, seriously, there'll be, like, 20 cars piled up where all the cars happen to start, so it looks kind of funny with all these names. So I didn't really get the MMO part of it, but... And the cops are very dumb in that game. Well, but as a free need... They can't figure out how to get you off-road. It's like, where'd he go? Hold on, though, because I don't want to sound like I'm talking negative about the game, because let's not neglect the fact it is a free need-for-speed game. I didn't pay anything for it, and it's totally free, so hey, you know, it's really hard for me to sit here and say, you know, talk bad about a free game, because it actually was pretty decent. And the only free games I can think of that I can talk bad about are Yaris, of course, Totem Ball. That was really bad. I mean, there's only a handful, so... But this is worth your time to look, especially if you're, like, a fan of racing games or you like need-for-speed. It plays a lot like one of the Xbox games that I've played in the past, so... Oh. Yeah, why not? All right. Check that out. Cool. Other than that, not a whole lot. I was playing some new iPhone games, because who doesn't love iPhone games? The Game Center games. There's a game in there called Word Challenge, and I was a little scared at first because it's by Zynga. Because there's words in it, and I was really scared. I know. I was like, oh, but I'm illiterate. But I actually thought it's... It's basically Boggle. You know the old game with Dias Boggle? I do. But it's free, and you can play online, and there's challenges, and it's... Did I mention free? The free part's good. So is that why it's called Word Challenge? Word Challenge? Yes, because it involves words. And it's challenging. Okay. It's challenging, because some of these words, I'm like, I never knew that was a word. Like the? Like what? I don't know. What does that mean? You want to play around on here? You made that word up. Every obscure three-letter word. You know. That's like playing Scrabble Solitaire. What does it all mean? I guess. I don't know. I could go in and look up some obscure words. They have that one game that's on the App Store now. It's like some pirate version of Scrabble, where all the words are like R. There's only so many words you can do in pirate-speak. R, and then Rrrrrrrrrrr? No, but that's literally what it was. Yeah, it was literally that. It was kind of a joke for Talk Like a Pirate Day or whatever. Oh, I see. Ooooh, why do you know that? Let's see, I'm actually launching the game right now so I can read some of the obscure words. I'm going into the challenges, because X-Link dared to send me some challenges. And I whooped him. But... let's see what are some of the wagers eager look at some of the like like these aren't words you think of like as you're playing these days let me look at some of like okay you're eager that's not a word it is a word according it's bad English it's like you're eager t-w-a-e-t way I've never I was what wait w-a-e-t way like I did you say I see tire and I see twas and I get those like twas the night before Christmas but way I've never heard of that and I almost said twig but I know how to toy gives um what's a Vega V IGA Vega I don't know that sounds dirty a Vega I think it's like it sounds like part of a word like vegetable vagina okay the definition of Vega one of the heavy rafters and especially a log supporting the roof of an American Indian or Spanish architecture of the southwest cuz I fucking know Spanish architect Jesus don't you feel sheepish now I do don't know that word all right you're more eager and what is the Scottish variant of two oh so fucking Scottish words are in the game I guess word would be banned and scrabble just saying alright so anyway that's my playing that's my one problem with this game is that just like totally you could just drag your finger around the board and connect three letters as long as there's a value probably have a word so if you might be able to make a word out of nothing but vowels actually alright how about the our guests how was your gaming week the doctor well much like rice princess I only own a Nintendo Wii so Nintendo of America I haven't playing video games at all what do you been doing in real life did you Apple Hill I went I did and I and I hate Captain Picard what it's first princess is showing me Captain Picard Captain Picard and I went to Apple Hill apparently and we ate lots of apples and had sex all right don't make things up all right you should make a drink named after you know Star Trek and call it Bacardi salacious salacious pop in our chat room says Aviga is a little vajay from Italy that hipsters right around on all right rice princess I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week but I thought I'd try anyway I played homework for the PC did you and insomnia for the bed and that's about it that's my gaming week in action you need to get a little like one of those like books to read in bed I need to get one of those little books you know that's what they're called right but well I think that any reader device or something like an iPhone or a Kindle or something and then I'm like one of those things with paper and words but then I'm like I'm like look at this game and see if books is you didn't let me finish my thought but no I was like oh rice princesses poor so I price just leave it for you fucker rub it in my face loves you well you can just take junk mail staple it together and pretend it's a book books I have to buy like $500 books for school I should probably read them but no I won't book should be $500 I mean I realize that you realize that yeah publishing companies are like well we can't make money on the books we have to keep re-releasing the same crap in church $500 well and plus they're not giving a discount on the iBooks and stuff now which I think is ridiculous for schools well I prefer like paper books anyway so it seems to me though that they should be given since they're not distributing the paper they should give a discount some of the books end up being cheaper anyway though I've gotten a few through Amazon that are just end up being something like maybe $30 cheaper than my old textbook for the Kindle well I use the Kindle app on my phone hmm so then like it's a lot better than bringing a whole big book with me I actually bought a book in iBooks this week iPhone no it's like a real is this the first time you bought a book in like 30 years probably no I buy books here and there but Judy Bloom it was not a shitty balloon book screen it was actually a political book which one I know weird I don't want to get into it because okay politics is controversial like a Playboy app on there and the problem is it's like everything in Playboy other than the nudity and it's like no one wants to read that nobody it's like wait a minute post advertisement man where are the titties but no it's just articles so that was my gaming week awesome yeah sounds like fun it was all right now before we get into some gaming news of yes we we do have some on the show housekeeping I'm not going to be here next week because I'm going to be in Los Angeles at the happiest place on earth with all the happy people so I won't be here next week however they're still going to be a show dark soccer is going to be here look he's going to be here and they're running things so good luck you all right so enjoy next week's show while I'm not here also joining us on Facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio and twitter.com slash olr is where you can find us on Twitter lots of fun any housekeeping you want to add rice princess no okay all right let's get into some gaming news Loki you want to start us off tonight apparently I GM claims to have received technical specs for the Nintendo DS 3ds Nintendo DS we know what's in it now years after it's come out stickers and puppies in myspace.com ah let's see apparently the handheld system will be using the DMP pick a 200 GPU wow that's impressive except I don't know what it is um running as slowed down 166 megahertz along with two arm 11 CPUs running at 266 megahertz and that's a lot of megahertz right no of course not which of course it doesn't seem to back the rumor that it was running the Nvidia Tegra chips and it says according to IGN as well they will also have a looks like a gig and a half of flash memory for storage much like the DS eyes do now except you know a little bit more apparently numerous developers are working on software for the platform obviously since they showed a bunch of stuff at e3 anyways and said that they've likened the graphical capabilities to current generation consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 albeit on smaller lower resolution screens that's Connie and apparently I guess it's only gonna have 64 megs of RAM which doesn't really compare you know favorably to like you know the iPhones half a gig see that's what I don't understand is why they can't put more RAM in these things I mean because RAM isn't that expensive and you know kind of sucks when you don't have enough of it it's just my thought so yeah do the cartridges not have it on there um no they don't but see that's the other thing is so I don't understand why you couldn't do that say for example have more RAM on the cartridge or something I don't know it's kind of dumb like even when the Xbox 360 came out they have like what like 256 megs of RAM or something in there I'm like you're releasing a system now that has like 256 megs of RAM when computers have well over that I mean we're not talking like a computer from say the year 2000 or something I mean we're talking about an Xbox 360 that's coming out years later and technology has just gotten way better I mean you have a cutting-edge you know CPU GPU and you know all this other stuff but oh we're only gonna stick like four megs of RAM in there you know and we're gonna run DOS or something it's like don't skimp on important stuff like that but I guess their reasoning behind is that first off the 3ds doesn't have an iOS or some sort of operating system the hog resources and also because it's low resolution it's not going to use as much RAM does it explain how the 3d without glasses works though no 3d without glasses it's basically like we talked about that like six months ago no it works very much like those oh and I of course can't remember what they're called now you have you seen those like for example kind of a hologram things that they have lenticular it's like a lenticular page or something like that where basically there's lenses in there that force half the image into one eye and half the image into the other eye and it makes it seem like it's popping out or not necessarily popping out but going back in it gives it depth so that's how it works oh there's actually a person standing behind the DS and like holding stuff in front of your face tiny tiny digital midget is how it's done mm-hmm so there will be plenty of sex games on the 3ds then what I would assume so yes it's powered by the force all right I don't know what powers this game but there's gonna be a apparently a reboot rumored of Tomb Raider this you know this has been rumored for some time and it's kind of a duh because you know Tomb Raider it's been making those games for times now I don't know seriously well the last one a reboot and then the last one before that a reboot I guess I don't know but well and then this Laura Croft game was also kind of a reboot but it was more like let's go this way with it let's make kind of a different game with the same character it's it's it's kind of different yes it's worked well all those times well actually some of them weren't bad and this most recent one the Laura Croft game is the most interesting one I think I've played since the first two on the PC years ago but they got it right then they wouldn't be rebooting it every few years well I think there's supposed to be different different franchises like I think there's gonna be new Laura Croft games for the arcade download and then the DVD blu-ray games will be these this this reboot or whatever that's been rumored for some time and in an interview with I'm sorry not an interview but a report from Eurogamer apparently says that the latest issue a PC gamer I guess I get their eyes on it first says that the new Tomb Raider is indeed happening it's supposed to be set on a Japanese island and it will offer Laura in an open world it's a quote cohesive level with multiple ways around the puzzles so it's one giant level I guess is how this game is supposed to work Croft 64 something like that they're gonna say that Laura is quote younger and inexperienced in the ways of raiding tombs I love that quote she's inexperienced in raiding tombs she just needs a strong man to share the way they're guessing holiday 2011 for Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 and PC notice how I left out the Wii as long as you can lock everybody in the freezer I'll be happy she looks so mad in that picture but a little picture yeah I you know obviously I really like the game that was on Xbox so it's kind of the download that's coming out on the other platforms really soon so if that's kind of the direction they're going with it I'm I'm all for it although it's not supposed to be that they've said it's gonna be a completely different kind of game I guess more like the original but I don't know like the latest game on the arcade kind of has me excited about Lara Croft again so this could be good I liked back when the early rumors were suggesting it was more of a survival horror game like if that's true and I think that's awesome that doesn't even make sense though how is there a segue between Tomb Raider and then oh did you ever see the descent the movie the descent did see the where it's all the chicks in the cave and it's like one of the scariest movies I've ever seen oh come on I don't think I've ever seen a scarier movie than the descent but it wasn't that the whole time like I've seen much scarier movies than that like the Care Bears movie shit was scary man Pokemon three assholes like you know caverns or something like that fraggle rock the movie give you nightmares it didn't really give me nightmares it actually like I bet I'm so I'm kind of sick like it actually made me want to go like explore a cave just so I could get scared more I want well hold on and now you know though what every gay guy in Ammon our County does rob rice princess I wanted to go spelunking were you gonna go I asked spelunking you'll laugh if I tell you the only movie that gave me nightmares huh poltergeist 3 some of the poltergeist movies were kind of scary it was the mirrors freaked out over mirrors for like a week I'm not even kidding about the Care Bears movie like there's this one part where they go into the fun house and it's like the guy's chasing him and he looks like you know crazy and I'm just like ah I love it oh no we watched labyrinth last night and I always get freaked out with the creatures that take their heads off I know they're no that when I was a little kid I would fast forward through that scene like no joke scared the crap out of me and you guys are fucking trivializing my this is have to do a Tomb Raider scary forest and then rice princess and I earlier we were talking about you know return to Oz and I'm sorry like I don't know how like any of you that are in like your late 20s early 30s that saw return to Austin it was in theaters that movie scarred me like it was she had the fucking head glasses it was scary it was based off the directly off the books yeah like all you know watered down like the other movie and I think that they should do more of those types of movies okay I gotta get watered down I gotta go to our chat room chat that orange on twitter.com bonds double-oh-six says the transformer movie from the 80s cuz someone died and I almost cried oh you know what and they say shit no bumblebees like oh shit no it wasn't bumblebee it was cliffjumper no it was bumblebee but no no it wasn't it was what's-his-face his dad said oh shit it isn't dented no one that when they were crashing into Cybertron oh yeah towards the beginning bumblebee goes oh shit no no no that wasn't that wasn't him I think it was no it was figure it out oh my god nerd battle I have seen I own the movie on laserdisc video CD and two DVDs of it okay and I have watched them right yes okay point that I have lines memorized okay and it was spike okay I got one more one more quick line here from chat chat on original calm salacious pop says lol Irene I ain't mad cuz if I was mad you would be dead I'm on seven I'm on seven you don't want to see me on ten let's see some of the other movies be named in chat right now labyrinth yeah legend with the young it was it was no legend there's a scene I cannot watch that movie the scene at the beginning where he's talking about the unicorns oh that scene that you we can't talk about cuz it's a spoiler yeah no the scene at the beginning when Tim Curry's like talking about unicorns and he's like mother night let your duck surround me and I'm like yes are both wrong it was frenzy that's on YouTube no I'm talking about when they blew up the ship on the on Unicron that was the one that spike said so dark soccer and you got more gaming news for us Robert Stack was in that in Orson Welles and Leonard Nimoy hey Orson Welles was there and then he died yeah that's sort of like what happened to Ralph Julia the one that said the one that said it is even dented oh shit what are we gonna do now at spike yes I was okay okay thank you I am BB anyway oh and and Robert Stack its character said damn it anyway there's somebody we need to bring back as a zombie Robert Stack hell yeah okay any who Atari launched this thing called Atari go and they want to make classic games good for social gaming ooh basically Tom Kozak who is the executive VP of online and mobile gaming said that they're gonna use Atari's catalog and independent developers to I guess provide more casual and online social gaming basically it's here's our old shit you don't have an Atari play this and I could go no sir you're wrong I have several I don't need your online blaming we've played their games on like every system that's been released ever yay I can play Missile Command again and then like I could put mr. awesome on my friends list on Facebook and then just you know get all these little like pokes and graphics about how much better he is at Missile Command to me why can't we just like have Atari go sit in their corner and stop putting out their old shit how about Atari no well they're also though are doing more things for the core games as well like they have a Facebook tie-in that's going to unlock extra con or might unlock extra content for test drive unlimited 2 and then asteroids online and deer hunter deer hunter online are they're gonna be reimaginings of those in a socialized context and I quoted that how does one socialize and asteroids hey rock dude I shot your rock oh yeah well my rocks now three that's what's gonna be on Facebook like it'll come up and it'll be all Jamie shot your rock and asteroids click here to shoot her back this is all free though right I hope if it's Facebook it's got to be right I don't know they use they use the word that I hate oh my microtransactions fun so yeah I will make the most microtransactions transaction is a trend zero trends but I've been on that site recently I think after this whole thing launched and like I was able to play Missile Command for free that some of the newer ones were gonna have the whole microtransaction I literally played one level and I was like Oh Missile Command back to porn I wonder if those different kind of Missile Command that's basically everyone's night on the internet every day Rob oh look something cool porn well wait a second why don't they do that I mean if you think about it it makes perfect sense to me everybody is looking for casual gaming and porn so why not make like a Facebook that's like you know full of porn and like you asked book and just have like you know tons of casual games you know they could be like Missile Command and stuff but they're no they have porn in the background or you know it's you're playing against porn stars or they're porno things where you have like a big dildo shooting floating vaginas or something yeah sure whatever yeah yeah sure whatever you know support any kind of work come on coming soon to the PC it's the Atari go I don't like it stop it right hey remember that one we bought years and years ago for Rob and it was like summer boys something like that in the back said like watch these boys beat the heat and their meat in this crazy sex drive bringing this up on our video game talk show that's the best line I've ever seen on the back of a DVD ever it's why we bought it for you Rob Wow cuz you like to watch gay porn but Rob so does Jamie but Rob has the ability to sleep through very noisy gay porn Wow at Disneyland oh yeah I remember the clincher right there at Disneyland we were we all we all went to Disneyland on the trip with with the giggling lesbians of orange on radio story the giggling lesbians of orange it was Kristen and Meg's ego to play Atari game and then we're all like awake and Rob's like all the girls we had a suite and it was like the living room with a fold with the height of bed and then there was a closed-off room with two double beds in it and so Kristin Meg's he had one and I ignored their slurp you know he says oh my and I was and I was I was you know so we all wore awake before Rob and Rob's just like dead to the world and very interesting like with this pillow half over said it was funny hold on watch if you listen carefully can you hear it yeah you hear all that clicking yeah that's all the people unsubscribing from all our right now so so Kristen takes out her laptop this is I brought gay porn and so it's really loud and she turns up her computer all the way and Rob's just like we let it play through like the biggest you know this aquatic scene that would make show girls I don't really be shamed I have one more idea for a game this is actually not it's not too bad I mean it's all right you know know how they have that kind of hobby that's geocaching or you know I guess GPS hunting that type of stuff you call it fine porn or found porn and basically hide porn around there and mark it on your GPS you know location people can go find the porn or there could be a naked slut yeah that's way too much work I'm gonna do that on my computer oh I found porn and I'm gonna watch it that's that's the new Google Earth a little click you can do like just randomly you have to search the Google Earth for like random porn place and rent please one time at work I was trying to type in Google and I typed in goggle and it brought up porn years ago it was a typo good job that's like when you tell people at work like oh yeah if you want to see the latest so what's going on you you go to whitehouse.com with the president because whitehouse.com I don't know if it still is we used to be a porno site hmm cuz whitehouse.gov is the correct oh clever how about video game news did you know we do that you're on orange on radio once in a while why would we do that I don't know Loki do you have some are you busy looking for making sure it up it's not a real website anymore it used to be used to be yeah anyways big brother was watching they were and they were amused so super street fighter 4 is not coming out on PC I know people are probably surprised considering it's been months since it's been released but uh it's not coming on PC because apparently games are pirated and stuff on the PC so yeah they didn't want to release it on PC I guess what does that mean I think that their first Street Fighter 4 game got pirated a lot now I think apparently they said in a recent interview with fourgamer.net that Yoshin Nori Oh No confirmed that while the PC version of Street Fighter 4 was a big seller worldwide wait a second that sold a lot and wasn't really pirated that much then okay whatever the publisher has no plans to put the new and improved super Street Street Fighter 4 iteration on home computers new platforms high rate of piracy they said that the port is still possible if Capcom can find reasonable DRM solution for the title you honestly just forget it I mean cuz you're gonna waste all this damn time spend all this money on DRM solution and be cracked in a day I mean just put it out really it's you're not gonna get pirated any less than if you have DRM on it then not having DRM on it do you think there's gonna come a time when the companies just start saying you know what too bad so sad for the people that can't handle this but the DRM now is that you must connect to the internet and you have to put in a unique serial number just like you do for a lot of MMOs like World of Warcraft and stuff do you think the day is coming where you know what that too bad so sad if that DRM doesn't work for you but piracy has gotten so bad that we have no other choice cuz I keep thinking in my mind I kind of I'm surprised the companies haven't got to this point you know as much as I don't like it as a consumer it would surprise me at all if they started going there it's possible that they do that but even sometimes there's ways around that around getting the phone home and types you know that kind of thing you could for example have a program running in the background that mimics their authentication server and you just change the forwards on like a certain IP address on your computer so that it forwards to that they've done that for a few things you know like some of the Adobe programs and stuff like that you phone home and you can disable that I would know so I mean don't get me wrong I don't I don't want folks to hear me the wrong way I'm not like saying like I support this DRM to start happening but I wouldn't be surprised if companies kind of felt like there was no other choice and by this way of like big companies like Microsoft and stuff that put out these operating systems and they supposedly have these ways that you know the system you know calls home that you know authenticate Windows and that kind of thing and yet there's still pirated versions out there despite the fact there oh Windows 7 no we're gonna have stronger security and part it it's like okay so that took three seconds instead of two seconds okay well in the interest of the companies I mean DRM is not always gonna work I mean it some people may not want to spend the effort to try to get past it usually it just ends up hurting the people that bought the game legitimately and all it really does is delay when people pirate the game so that does drive some sales for people but they have to also realize a lot of people that we're gonna you know pirate the game probably we're gonna buy it originally so you technically not losing sales because if they can't pirate the game they're just not gonna download it and they're not gonna play it they're not gonna you know unless it's a really really good game they're not gonna go out and buy it all right hmm you guys remember the old like pathetic ways that they used to like try to stop pirating like we're gonna put a crazy word in the instruction booklet that you have to know like to get past the thing it's like yeah well then you just told all your friends what's the second word on page four of the manual yeah I'm yeah and what's the crazy you know third day of the week the way we said you know it was like and then you just tell all your friends and it doesn't matter the wheels I don't know the wheels yeah they for the Lucasarts games they had wheels that you had to rotate around at different things and then you'd have to read a code number out of one of the slots or something what wah wah and those even didn't work either because you could either photocopy the manual or you can rip apart that disk and photocopy the disk so once again it doesn't matter what DRM solutions they put out there even if it's a USB dongle or something like that some really expensive programs like graphic programs so like that that are you know thousands of dollars will actually have a physical device that needs to be plugged into the computer to work those still can be pirated though because people find ways to mimic whatever that device is and there's no way around everything everybody's gonna find a way around something given them out you know a significant amount of time there will always be a way around something because if you can make it someone else can make it again all right well speaking of a game that was somewhat hurt by piracy allegedly halo reach I came out of course a couple weeks ago and if you already have beat the game and you're already bored of it maybe there should be a mini game that you should go play that is actually hidden in halo reach it's called reach racer and it's a warthog racing game that is inside reach what happens is that if two people get to a spot in the oni sword base you can actually play this little mini game reach racer oh you all right over there you made me drop my mic sorry about that trauma I hey I think I think that's kind of cool I like when there's fun little things like that in a game so I just know all morning I was hearing boom yay boom yay boom yay all morning why was Dan playing halo reach yes is that what he actually says yeah no it has a little party mode thing in there where you get a headshot kids go and then they put on the duck boots from Castlevania go right sorry bones double o6 and share bonds double o6 and chat says okay that almost made me want to get reach that's kind of cool well the the forge editor and the reach anyways it's just really incredible anyways so maybe that's your thing going back up a little bit in chat Robert M is talking about the copy protection thing it says the pages with red paper to keep it from being copied I remember those two there were manuals that would have like the red paper so ridiculous but it kind of worked for a little bit like until the internet came out where it's color scanners and they're like foil again color copies not available to copy these CDs alright release dates coming up in a minute but first dark Sakura well there has been something that has been spotted a new Wii controller oh it's actually the Wii remote plus that seems to be a combination of the Wii motion plus and the Wii remote and it's gonna be coming with a game called fling smash that well it looks like tennis but with a crazy-ass ball so you have to use this ball guy named zip and you use your controller I guess to smack them around the different places I'd I'd have to see more than just this this picture and now there is no date out for the UK the game is listed but not the special controller so I don't know when they're gonna get it overseas I can't help but feel this is like kind of like a Wii play type thing it is throw in a controller with a subpar game there was there is no interest in this game whatsoever not that I'm judging this game without playing it but I'm just gonna take a wild guess and guess didn't say it's not very good it will be the best game of the there'll be the best-selling game of the year because it comes with a stupid remote well if you think about the games 50 bucks and you get a remote that's probably worth at least 50 bucks because I'm sure it's gonna be more than just the normal remote and people should get pissed off because now they bought a remote and super emotional plus and now they come out with something that's all-in-one despite the fact that perhaps they should have I don't know put it all in one to begin with so that they could do all the stuff that they said they were gonna be able to do it prints money dark use K and chat says whatever we is dead you guys agree no what what do you think rice princess we have a week now I use it for Netflix it's poop it's doing all right it's just there's I mean the games coming out that were our big releases for Nintendo I just don't really care too much about like ooh it's Donkey Kong Country again wow that's awesome I remember playing that back on super Nintendo let's not forget how amazed and in all we all were after e3 at you know their lineup and yes I was impressed with Metroid other M and then it sucked wow that's awesome thank you I'm glad that team ninja really pulled it off oh but it sucked and then you know new Zelda game whoop these shit it's just a brighter more colorful cheerful Twilight Princess with new gadgets and shit I mean I don't know it's it was it was sounds like fun it was it was a difference between like you know what it looks like on paper what it actually comes out to be and I don't know the 3ds 3ds will be kind of cool you'll have to check out what the games look like and stuff like that but as far as like the console releases for this year from Nintendo I could care less yeah Kirby's epic yarn I guess looks all right it's kind of a neat design for the game but you know like Donkey Kong I could care less or couldn't care less I guess because care less that makes no sense and then fling smash well no one cares about fling smash except now that has a you know stupid controller thing in it all right well let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of things that are coming out to a store near you real soon this week actually some pretty cool stuff coming out of course dead rising 2 will be out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC this week so that's pretty sweet guitar hero warriors of rock you know it's kind of funny is a lot of the music games coming out nowadays people don't care so but guitar hero where he's a rock is coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and we never forget they're all $60 because Activision is fucking lame and so they decided to charge $60 for all three games because I don't know you're suckers and you'll buy it so wonderful let them get away with that and then they're gonna be charging $60 for all their Wii games oh but it doesn't matter because people don't buy games in the week also of course guitar hero warriors of rock will be coming out in different bundles they have one with like the full band set up which is really just the instruments from last year so don't expect the new guitar in that you can only get that in the guitar kit and they aren't selling the guitar separately so if you want the lame new guitar that's out there you're gonna buy in that stupid bundle other fun stuff coming up this week a re-release of the sims 3 they're calling the deluxe edition I believe that's with some of the download content are in the download content but the expansions that were in there it's sims 3 and sims 3 ambitions save you a little bit money there I guess farm frenzy animal country on the DS deer drive on the DS it's a deer hunting game front mission evolved on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this is kind of not necessarily the tactical strategy game as before but it is a armored core clone so that'll be coming from Square Enix and I don't know if it'll be very good oh and it's also on PC uh Ottlier Rorona the alchemists of Arland that's coming out now on PlayStation 3 it's a role-playing game from Tecmo and I believe Nippon Ichi more effects on Xbox 360 from 505 games Tropico 3 is getting the gold edition coming out on PC quantum 3 the kind of the Gears of War clone on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 from Tecmo koei and crap from Ubisoft pets fantasy moonlight magic and sunlight magic those are coming out this week on the Nintendo DS if you like fishing we're Paula's pro bash fishing 2010 on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and the Wii DS and PSP they also have a bundle for the PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and the Wii those actually come with a wireless fishing rod except for the week comes with a crappy attachment for the controllers and then FIFA soccer 2011 coming out and pretty much all systems except for PlayStation 2 I believe my sim sky heroes on Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 we DS and what else we have coming out oh of course plants vs. zombies the console edition for the Xbox 360 it's really just the port of the X actually it is just the Xbox live arcade game but it also comes with Pagle and Zuma as well as well some download content for that so that's kind of cool we're checking out of course because plants vs. zombies is sweet Greg Hastings paintball to a really crappy first-person shooter game I mean really who would want to play a game that mimics something that mimics combat when you can just play a game that mimics combat but whatever that's on a Wii and Xbox 360 this week oops prank party coming from oops let's have a prank party ah yes can you guess who this is coming to us from there they're a company that used to make really awesome stuff and then they purchased this smaller company that's right it's Hudson coming to us from Konami Thank You Konami because we really need some more party games on the week there just wasn't enough what kind of pranks can you pull that's a good question what kind of prank pranks can we pull let's see here it's uh apparently it's incredibly fun as smart mix of a hundred brain-teasing puzzle-solving and reflex testing games wait a second that's not a prank at all nah has fooled you it's actually brain games pranks on you but apparently dancing no like you know I know no putting like rice pandas and apparently freezer apparently why you're playing the game though you can T you can tease the competition with outlandish pranks all a name of good clean fun embarrassing outfits side-splitting family-friendly pranks they make light-hearted taunts oops prank party will have players coming back for more off-the-wall four-player action time and time again no they won't no one cares frisbee in chat says I thought Loki was gonna say oops pregnant pregnant party I'd go to that party deafed in chat says oops prank party isn't that olr every other week see Sid Meier's pirates coming out and we this week the guild to Renaissance on PC haunted house the remake of the Atari game thank you sorry for bringing out wonderful games that are not three oh wait no this is a remake of an old classic Atari game that's on the weeb guess yes we'll just have to wait for my xbox 360 xbox live arcade version to come out I'm highly anticipating that one frisbee in chat says cutting the brakes out of someone's car now that's a prank party game I play that sounds like fun like really horrific or you know when you can't do really Jamba juice and there's no Jamba juice shut up you're a bitch and she did that to me once just so you know I was really really really thirsty and it was a hot day and Irene goes you want some of my Jamba juice and I'm like oh it sounds so awesome and I take the cup and they go to take a sip and it's empty and she's laughing that's the meanest thing that's ever done to me and then she had a delicious cupcake and thanks to our wonderful DJ friend from the Bay Area get fit with Mel B's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 yes it'll be the first guess what this is a collector's item because it's the first PlayStation move fitness game whoo I'm not really excited about that it's gonna be crap hello I'm Mel B there's a Jenny McCarthy fitness game on the Wii and I just I would love to do all those nasty exercises every time I think about the Spice Girls in a video game though I just can't help it here in my mind let's put another girl through her pieces if you've ever played the Spice Girls game on PS1 none of you probably have a few more things coming out this week good god sorry it's it's getting in the fourth quarter so I love how it's all crap like oops prank party just bogging down well okay I mean there's a lot of crap that comes out in between our Call of Duty games I make it snappy script spelling bee it's a spelling bee game on the DS that'll be exciting death smiles the version without all the fun extra stuff it's slightly cheaper on Xbox 360 so I release their Final Fantasy 14 the I had to wait another week edition that is coming to us on PC painkiller pandemonium on PC what's pandemonium about it is it's probably not good and then I don't think this dates right but they're saying the sly collections coming on PlayStation 3 I think it's later in the later in the year and then finally this is high-quality Wii games for you this is one of those first party games for Nintendo that's really gonna innovate and change the whole landscape of the Wii we party coming to us on the Wii that's also from Hudson that made the Mario Party games I played it at e3 it was cute but it's another party game cute that's just like with them complaining on why the GameCube people only buy it for kids stuff it's only got kids game why can't we get people to actually you know develop mature games on our system I don't know why you know I have a question for anyone no okay when you've heard of this game that's gonna come out and it's really hyped and it sounds really good and you really want to play it and then you actually get it lately has it lived up to the hype for you you mean like Final Fantasy 14 when I played the beta yeah I wanted to cry it was so tears of joy no tears of pain yeah don't worry they're limiting the amount of suffering you actually have to endure because you can't play long hours on this game because they will start dropping your XP really yeah I haven't played the full game yet and like here's here's the sick thing y'all I'm really sick oh you're sick here's the thing um even though like I really hated the beta I still feel like I need to buy the retail game because I spent so much time on 11 and it's a Final Fantasy games oh that's exactly yes I know the industry you do have a problem it's called wasting your money on shit don't do it how about you just wait for the reviews to come out yeah I'm gonna try and see if some of the reviews what they say but I mean like okay remember back in the day like say with Symphony of the Night or like Metal Gear Solid or something there was this big hype about it and you play it and it's a great game it's innovative it's just wonderful nowadays it doesn't seem like there are games like that anymore what do you think Rob um I don't know I thought Final Fantasy 13 was pretty awesome and it had a lot of hype behind it I mean not 14 but 13 was pretty good I don't know sometimes the hype machine can kind of ruin games like I think part of the reason I didn't want to buy Halo Reach is that like you just can't get away from it and I'm just like like I was playing Lara Croft online and I actually got an Xbox Live message somebody that was like well you're not playing Halo Reach and I'm just like screw you I'll play what I want I'm like I'm gonna put in freaking cameo or one of like the Xbox 360 launch games just to irritate you but then I realized I'd actually have to play cameo and that I don't know I someone saw someone this week playing on my friends list and you know who you are I think cuz I don't remember who you are someone's actually playing lost via domus the lost console wow it was terrible absolutely terrible like the show lost the show law I was at the one where Michael's like man I don't have time for that world and all he was doing was yelling well the whole time like I remember that game it was awful all right let's go to Japanese release dates of Loki's known with the US coming out in Japan this week we have monster hunter frontier online season 9.0 on the Xbox 360 from Capcom is the monster hunter series is pretty epic over there although they don't really do anything with it here on the 360 interesting dead rising 2 gets its Japanese release this this week as well to kind of coincide with the stateside one over here Madden NFL 11 gets its release in Japan it's been out here for a little bit but it gets localized for Japan so it actually even though it's still all the same American football teams it's all in Japanese a game called quantum theory comes out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan there's a regular and limited edition it's kind of a looks like kind of like a bayonetta II type of game I don't know lots of like epic looking cutscenes and guns and you know swords and limbs falling off and all that fun stuff that's from Tecmo I wonder if it's a team ninja game I don't think it is though going over to the PlayStation 3 probably quite a few of those same games coming out of there yep dead rising 2 comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3 and quantum theory and Madden NFL so all those same games coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well but no monster hunter because that is exclusive I guess to the 360 going over to the Nintendo Wii to check out the releases over there we have really not a lot this week it's kind of slow really the next big big release is the Kaito no Kirby game which would be the Kirby's epic yarn over here that comes out in Japan on the 14th of October before that not a lot of big stuff PlayStation 2 obviously things have really slowed down so nothing of note there on the Nintendo DS okami den chisaki tayo comes

recon predator Tom Clancy's Hawks to also on October 1st FIFA 11 Sean White skateboarding Tom Clancy's Hawks to again for over PC and that's it for this week on the end of that fiend so something that hopefully you didn't purchase a PB well of course as we mentioned last week a PB is no more it has been canceled after just three months and well fans aren't exactly happy about that they are a little upset because they invested you know 50 bucks on the game that they can no longer play well apparently I guess people have been trying to get refunds via steam and haven't really met you know with any success on that but EA apparently is gonna try to help people out it says the user has been posting about their experience talking to EA support regarding this issue several users have been able to receive a $20 discount code for their inconvenience while others have I guess managed to convince support representatives to give them a game of equivalent value the I guess the person that posted the threat originally included a chat log that shows that they were able to get a copy of Dragon Age 2 upon the tiles release so I guess if you bought a PB you may want to go chat with EA support which is of course support.ea.com and see if they can help you out and get you some of your money back that you spent on it you're gross Rob sorry sorry totally listening to Loki right now I promise mm-hmm yes well I'm not talking anymore so that's not really helpful we're still listening to you okay I was offering rice princess and black licorice and she was like oh no get that out of my face looks like dog crap I don't want your licorice it's really good you want some dark soccer I can't have licorice and Dan insists on eating it around me in his car and I'm like gag it's really good so what I had to do since rice princess loves it so much I waved the bag in front of her face so she could get the smell and then she's like sure I want one and that means she just wants to take one to throw it at me so I let her put her hand in the bag to grab when she's all like you put them up your butt before you put them in the bag knock it off all right oh yeah bummer about APB and all that but I feel bad for those customer service reps that I have to deal with all the angst because you know it's gonna open the floodgate once you hear the one person got something free now you know no thanks in part to this show there's gonna be tons of people that go on there and they're like I want my free stuff I bought APB where's my free stuff just like that I found a Christmas card that was hello random no I school it was sent to me by one of our listeners by by Rob overseas mm-hmm and it says fuck office parties fuck jingle bells fuck mince pies fuck Rudolph like Santa fuck Christmas how appropriate since you're Jewish now yes I'm gonna put it up on my desk right now good idea all right hey let's say 100 Matt wants to know us so what's the difference is the black licorice bigger and longer just tastier actually yeah if you like the taste of shit like which is amazing all right bro you're gross your face is gross hey this game is awesome though it's not gross at all you don't know Jack remember this game this is like the best video game ever I loved this game it's hardly a video game but yeah that's like a game show you type of game well anyway it's been rated by the ESRB for the 360 the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and you know what that means it's coming out soon because the ESRB always ruins and spoils releases so it looks like it is really happening THQ is revamping it all we know is that the game got rated on crude humor quote the ending credits contain audio commercials of fictitious TV reality programs for example farting with the stars which is accompanied by lard loud flatulent sound effects yay more dick and fart jokes my favorite yay I never talk about those not at all so I'm your card you should put a picture up of rice princess holding black licorice I'm never touching it ever again shut up all right I think this means now that our show is starting to completely derail it's time to bring it back to some classics for the segment we call here on orange lounge radio the classic game of the week it's a chance for dark soccer to dive into the video game vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids and your spinach trucks stop chasing the spinach truck and play this video game for a little bit dark soccer what's the classic game of the week elevator action whoa Ella later go down good end a whole elevator action is first of all this is Dan suggestion okay elevator action came out in 1983 by Taito you know what else Taito gave us bubble bobble and puzzle bobble yay I love Taito games and it actually had a sequel elevator action 2 also called elevator action returns the game is great it's the music was done by Yoshino Imamura so let's go on with how the game is played you play a spy and you go down an elevator you actually are in a building that has lots of elevators and you have to can get secret documents and go through 30 levels and then do all these puzzles involving different elevators and you've got enemy agents they're trying to shoot you no face so you either have to shoot them back or run away or hide and you get all your documents and you go from the top of the building to the bottom and the lower that you get you actually have to solve more puzzles to get around it the control was a four-way joystick two buttons one for shooting the other for jumping and kicking because I always jump and kick at the same time so very very simple easy game two players you'd alternate times you play as agent 17 codenamed Otto so you don't have a timer but you do have a time limit it goes into a hurry-up mode so the music will change and tell you to hurry up pretty much yeah um you see you have different you get a different score for retrieving documents knocking on agent by dropping a light on them crush an agent using the elevator gory yeah you can get crushed to the elevator too if you're not careful knock out an agent by jumping or kicking eliminate an agent by gun and you get bonus points completing each round and you also get an extra life we hit 10,000 points as far as versions of it there is actually a parody called Ella paper action which is a that sounds stupid yeah um they had a two of them on palm OS agency and agency two it's based on elevator action there's Dexter's laboratory robot rampage that's based on elevator action to 505 games put a similar game out on the week called spy games elevator mission it's called elevator combat in Europe there's a port on Gameboy there's any s version that made it on to the virtual console in 2007 and an elevator action death parade is a light gun shooter that uses elevator doors when changing scenes so there you go as far as earlier ports there was the ZX spectrum and shred CPC MSX Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy there was one plan for the Atari 2600 but there is it never was released however the prototype exists and was sold at classic gaming Expo 2001 it was only 95% complete though and then Sony had a mobile version of it as far as compilations we have elevator action EX for Game Boy Color elevator action old new Game Boy Advance elevator action returns on Sega Saturn which I think I have title legends set in the title legends power up and yeah that's it so can I be honest about something what I think this game sucks like it's one of those things I remember much more fondly as a child but I actually bought that title collection when it was out on the regular Xbox and kind of revisited this game and I was like this game is horrible like I think part of that's just cuz it's really hard and always get crushed by elevators I've seen Dan play through this game just like all the time really and when I said hey Dan help me think of a classic game he's like elevator action okay no I mean it is a classic in some regards I just I didn't I thought it was one of those games always kind of looked better than it played now you know what came in in this vein that I actually like a whole lot better hmm mappy maybe mappy will be on the list one day all right well there it is good old good Namco goodness like it or not your classic game of the week elevator action elevator action there it is that's a pretty cool YouTube to the guy beating the level because it makes it look so easy it's really not this game is hard if you ever play this game rice princess no it's hard looks like it it is okay all right well that's gonna do it for this first half year of orange lounge radio but don't go anywhere there's plenty more when we come back including your phone calls and your tweets make sure you get in those Twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr and we're gonna talk about PlayStation 3 updates that that wrecked some things related to USB we're gonna talk about a website that'll bribe you with Microsoft points to use it and much more when we come back after this break with more of orange lounge radio welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are live on this Sunday evening September the 26th of 2010 where we are taping the 383rd episode of our podcast if you can believe it I am I know right we're almost 400 is right around the corner if you think about it it's gonna be what about 17 weeks away it's about four months away so right around Christmas New Year's yeah crazy huh no wait a little further than that like January February maybe just in time for Valentine's Day whoa all right joining us tonight as you can hear a rice princess and the doctor and we were talking a little bit about the break music which I know you podcaster folks can't hear it sadly it's copyright stuff I'm sorry you can't play it but we can do it live and we played a variety of songs during that break and the last one we played was from Secret of Mana the flight into the unknown and that made Jamie go let's have a secret of mana party and I'm like wow yes that's a great idea for sirs cuz I haven't played secret how long does that game take to beat though it's a really long time isn't it it's a yeah I think you can be in one sitting oh unless we marathon did switched out who would be crazy the doctors taking pictures in studio I don't know why I'm just kidding so but um yeah the secret about a marathon would be fun I actually got really far and secret to evermore I got really close to beating it I never did though I don't think evermore is nearly as bad as some people think it was yeah oh yeah Wow you know you know we should do we should do RPG a month seriously good luck tearing me away from Wow but here's Rob's RPG of life maybe on oh something else about secret evermore cuz another song we played in that break was the theme to Guild Wars which I think that composer that does the the soundtrack to Guild Wars Jeremy soule I think is how you say his last name is really talented and he composed that when he was like a practically teenager like 19 or 20 I think he did secret evermore like when he was a teenager he actually I think composed that soundtrack so cray-cray crazy right so I think actually no I think it take the bat he was 19 when he did I think the secret evermore stuff and then later on probably in his 20s he did the Gil war stuff but he was very young when he did a lot of that and he did the music to oblivion which I know you're not a big fan of that game but the soundtrack is a amazing yeah he's a talented guy so he did the music to pray which even though it was kind of a and for actually it's one of the few first-person shooters I really really really liked and you know why because it was made for people who are terrible at first-person shooters because you never die you cannot die and pray it's easy mode when you die you go into the spirit world where you have to shoot these like ghost looking things to regain your health and stuff and then you go back right where you left off so pray is like total easy mode but it had really good music so anyway cool there you go chat that orange lounge radio.com you're playing plants versus zombies salacious pop and chat says people who hated evermore were just being 16 year old weeaboo square stands and didn't like it because it was square USA developed and Rama is starting to fight saying actually no it took a week to beat that's why let's throw down you know what it had a dog in it instantly cool so there you go all right let's get back into some more video game news here Twitter topics coming up at twitter.com slash olr just a little bit so make sure you're working are you all right over there dark soccer you're like throwing everything you okay my nose was a little runny so I reached for tissue which slid off of my scanner onto where I had placed the portfolio on my portfolio on the letter tray and it slid off of that onto the floor and flipped over and then the portfolio fell down way to go fantastic good job all right again get those twitter topics and we're gonna be getting to those in just a moment but in the meantime some fast rapid-fire news starting with Loki yes there is an update done to 3d game heroes this week you may remember that game the one that's kind of like Zelda but not this time they've done an update that adds a sack boy playable character which is kind of cool and then on top of that there's also some 50 new player made heroes that have been added to everyone's lineup plus allows the players to carry weapons over into their new game plus files and incorporate a handful of bug fixes that they've done to the game so that's kind of cool sounds awesome that's one of those games like I played like maybe the first third I have not touched my copy of it yet it's actually so it's it's again it is the Legend of Zelda on ps3 and I am surprised Nintendo has not sued yet like it is that close to the original Legend of Zelda it's you'd like this game I think Grace Princess cuz you like the old school games right I do like the old school this 3d game hero is like one big just BJ to old video games Wow no right that's hot I know wait so which Zelda is it most like the very very first one oh not my favorite but like it this week mark the first releases to the PlayStation Store of PlayStation 1 imports yes now we're able to play games from other regions and the first two releases you may wonder what they are Joanna key and Gaia seed yay ooh so I Nikki is great so you'll be able to get those on the PlayStation Store they will run you six dollars $5.99 let's see other fun stuff there is a fan made Half-Life 2 movie trailer that was put out at now this is not just some amateur movie trailer by the way it's actually done by an animator Marco Sputoni and he's actually I believe he works for Weta so he has one damn sexy trailer out there that could very well turn into a real movie I mean it looks pretty awesome so that's available out there right now check out and then of course a trailer for a game that I I've been looking forward to for quite a long time and this week during I believe is left over from last week at Tokyo game show Earth Defense Force insect Armageddon has its first trailer out there and it looks awesome it's a got this giant spider mech thing that's attacking New Detroit which is the city that the game is gonna take place in and also looks like it carries over some of the stuff from Earth Defense Force to including a jetpack and I believe there's four different upgrade armors you're gonna be able to get I'm assuming one of them is this jetpack thing so I can't wait it's supposed to be coming out this fall or not this fall uh that'd be cool no this spring speaking of trailers and she brought up that Half-Life 2 trailer did you see that freaking Pokemon real life Pokemon Armageddon or whatever it was dumb what in the heck was that it's like for those that didn't see it it's like real have you guys seen the rice princess started watching it but then I realized it was Pokemon and I was just like it's like somebody took Pokemon and made it real life and it's like obviously like a student project or something was like a big-budget student project like it's it's crazy how kind of the team rocket things are all you know the sci-fi of or the the the effects were good enough for sci-fi television because that's what the special effects look like was like the really bad like shark to post kind of effects so that's awesome yeah just saying so I got this got me thinking here because again you know there's folks in chat talking about like role-playing games and stuff a salacious pop is saying you know what I really enjoyed Final Fantasy mystic quest because I played it knowing it was kitty you know that game wasn't as terrible as everybody out made it to be it just wasn't Final Fantasy just like 11 but actually I think dark soccer might be onto something with the role-playing game of the month you know I have an idea what do you think like we pick like a role-playing game like a classic of some sort that we would see who can get the furthest in like a month and then we could have like a blog of how we're doing in the game and submit screenshots and stuff like that why are you laughing rice princess because I think the first game should be earthbound well maybe even lose maybe the first game can't be earthbound I don't know what do you think dark side do you like this idea should we should we have like a classic role-playing game that we all have to play I can already tell you I would I would freaking lose because I have school we'll have work yeah but work doesn't give you homework sometimes they do actually so maybe maybe we should just pick like one night where we've got nothing going on and do do this do the Zelda fest what what no I saw a role-playing on a Zelda fest quit trying to change something no it's like the Zelda fest we see who can get the furthest ah okay okay by like a certain time limit we could do something like that could be interesting fun or be like still playing damn plants versus zombies because I recognize the music because it plays in my sleep now and SSG 100 Matt says this will happen when Rob and Jamie actually play their magic card battle yeah that was like a year ago right no I found them recently magic all right I have to let me get back into some quick news here this is news that makes me very happy and I know to make Loki very very happy rumors abound once again that Capcom is indeed working on a new Mega Man Legends game this is as they should be this is a source telling Mega Man fansite Rockman Corner that apparently a new game in this series that started on the PlayStation 1 is in development they're not confirming that it's called Mega Man Legends 3 but they are saying it's the next entry in the series which makes it would make sense to me that it's not gonna be like Mega Man Legends 3 it'll be like Mega Man Legends with some subtitle that acts as like a reboot because you know it's been a good what eight years at least since we've seen the last game in the series so yeah this project right now is very very secretive and not a lot of information is available now you might just say well okay anybody could pull out of their ass that they're working on a new Mega Man Legends game what brings this some clout to it the tipster that is bringing this to the attention of Rockman Corner is called the shadow and you have to trust the shadow because Alec Baldwin played him no but the shadow also pegged the release date of Mega Man 9 and some of the very specific details in the game so it's somebody who has kind of done this before so who knows could be very cool I'm excited I would love to see kind of something we didn't get to tonight but I know had been floating around out there was a Mega Man Doom mod that made Doom look like Mega Man Legends kind of it was it was actually kind of awesome I have to admit so we have let's see when the Kinect comes out we're going to have dance masters from Konami we're gonna have dance central from harmonix well guess what overseas they're getting a game called dance paradise in Europe it's coming from mindscape and you're universal music it's gonna be coming out when the Kinect comes out no word on a release over here but just to give you a kind of a heads up on what to expect in this game since it is a partnership with Universal Music you do have some pretty big names in this for instance David Guetta and Kelly Rowland when love takes over Gwen Stefani what you waiting for Lady Gaga bad romance LaRue bulletproof MC Hammer can't touch this no doubt hey baby Sophie Ellis I just I love that all of those songs were in the last few months and then MC Hammer with Kentucky from 30 years ago so feel it but it's a classic Sophie Ellis Beckster with murder on the dance floor and the doctor's favorite song Jerry Halliwell with its raining men remember MC Hammer needs money well you know as you know but then I'm looking at screenshots of the game and I'm kind of like oh this looks like it's gonna be like kind of a cheap hack of a game I don't know I don't know if it looks really that good but the song list is is pretty darn good because they did team up with Universal Music so hmm so 20 of the 40 songs have been announced so far so yeah I don't know interested to see more in that also one other story there's rumors going around this week that project Milo was canceled this week 19 contractors that were working on the project were let go some of the other people that were on the project are going to be using the technology in a new fable themed connect game when your game doesn't have a title it's probably not going to come out yet I agree with last week's statement from that it was basically the creepy pedo in the yard game like just watching those videos was scary so lion head isn't gonna comment on rumors or speculation but it's looking like yeah might not happen by the way Peter Molyneux was quoted in the past few months saying that Milo is basically a very very big tech demo so maybe that was the hint that the beginning of the end was coming so that's all I've got dark Sakura I got some stuff how about rock band we have the download content coming out that will be a lot of anthrax woohoo I love anthrax so the anthrax pack will be among the living I'm the man Indians mad house which I love that song and metal thrashing mad actually the later two are live versions and the whole pack will be 680 Microsoft points for individual tracks coming out stuff again that I have to get my chemical romance I'm not okay and welcome to the black parade totally totally want both of those 30 seconds to Mars closer to the edge a tray of coffin nails buck cherry out of line and two doobie brothers tracks listen to the music and long train running I still can't believe there's a band called Atreyu there's a band saying there's a band called ludo all right that's awesome yes and they're pretty cool so as far as other stuff how about cave story there is going to be a DSI where and what I heard a gasp I just I like cave story now looks really cool if there's that a screenshot that we're looking at here that's cool like updated version of the cave story graphics on the screen well and basically yeah and actually yeah it's um commission if this picture was commissioned in honor of the announcement so I guess it's a maybe an idea of what it might be could be like but at any rate it's going to be a DSI where a version of the game and it will they say it's done they're just testing it and it's apparently going to I have a classic one and an update and then last but not least Donkey Kong Country for Wii it's called Donkey Kong Country Returns and it comes with a banana pocket for your it's like a condom for your condom for your Wii it kept anyway it comes with this banana thing that you can put your wiimote into so double banana it's a banana pouch I just keep thinking maybe I'm just banana it's a penis joke

follow us on Twitter you should follow us on Twitter anyway so that way we can tweet you with reminders about what's coming up with the show yay when sometimes when we go to conventions and stuff random things we will send out on the Twitter as well like pictures and all that cool stuff all right back into some more news Loki what do you got for us I've got plants versus always not I've got some cool stuff including you may remember some of the things that Sony does to you know curb piracy and stuff well now they've disabled it's funny because everybody's joking oh now they have those USB mod chips they're gonna disable the USB ports I only weren't that far off they've disabled some USB peripherals I guess according to a report that was on their website the issue I guess they were disabling counterfeit ps3 controllers but it was actually disabling third our unlicensed third-party controllers in some of these devices affected by this actually were the yobo ps3 joybox which I believe is an arcade stick the XCM cross battle plus adapter which was kind of a adapter lie you use an Xbox 360 controller on the PlayStation 3 and the split the split fish frag FX which is kind of a hybrid controller and mouse and that's kind of lame that that's part of firmware 3.5 other things though that it kind of broke as well some old mad cats controllers even though they are fully licensed apparently they are now broken so if you only 2008 wireless ps3 gamepad or the 2008 wired ps3 gamepad or the ps3 wireless micro con which is now discontinued they do not work anymore so man if I were mad cats I would be pissed like especially if they're licensed if they're unlicensed well then too bad so sad right but if they're licensed that's grounds to like sue and stuff yes soon well and I don't know if this is like meant to stop people from using the USB mod chips but that last firmware update was to stop people from using the USB mod chips so I can only assume this is either an extra precaution or they're just being dicks I'm gonna go with the latter I think they're being dicks because really I don't know about you but I haven't heard of some big ol mass problem with counterfeit controllers I don't know people out there going oh man all those counterfeit controllers out there I just can't find a good ps3 controller well there are a lot of shitty controllers out there actually yeah but these are actually counterfeit controllers there's a YouTube that was on Kotaku as well where someone actually bought a cheap DualShock 3 controller that was a counterfeit so you know that's kind of lame that those are out there but I mean I can't imagine this is a huge problem that one that warrants a software update I mean hell I can think of a lot of problems that this console has it haven't been fixed with a software update like home being lame nice all right well how would you like to get free Microsoft points that's right free Microsoft points well guess what there's a website that will bribe you with free Microsoft points they're keeping it in the family because that website is Bing that's right Microsoft search engine the rival to Google Bing is running this new little like Bing toolbar that you can install on your browser by the way well at the first announcement said that it was only compatible with Internet Explorer but some things I've been reading in forum chats and stuff say that it actually works with Firefox so I don't know you I mean it would make sense it would only work with Internet Explorer right that whole like Microsoft only stuff but anyhow if you use it to take part in daily promotions or do searching you will earn reward points that you can then turn into Microsoft points so here's the thing though you can only get the Microsoft points in 100 point denominations but just installing the toolbar gets you 250 points so that's kind of cool I guess so what I'm also hearing though again the reading through comments and things is apparently they will only like send you the the points in like cards in the mail like what a waste of cardboard and all that stuff like when they could be sending it to you digitally cuz like you know a hundred Microsoft points is like a buck 25 seriously yeah I'm gonna try it with Firefox have fun give me your Microsoft points and Microsoft is desperate to get Bing off the ground like they're trying all kinds of stuff well you know what's interesting it's not a bad site actually their maps is actually really cool and in some ways it's even better than Google like it's actually caused Google to have to kind of like up some of the aunties on some of their things like the satellite pictures and stuff so you know Bing it has some pretty neat stuff going for it I mean it's not terrible just because it's Microsoft I keep seeing advertisements and like being this and being automatically like download itself on my toolbar and bing bing bing bing and it's just like bada-bing and yeah exactly exactly I like that they have like a neat little picture every day and they're their application on did it oh no did it maybe I was trying to click cancel and I click the other thing so now it closed all my windows great and it means you closed your next story didn't it yay awesome oh well that's what I have an iPhone for you're gonna bring up stories on the iPhone why not all right well I got a stretch for time here I was ready to go on to the next story you know what Rob sometimes things just don't go the way you expect them to hey don't be rude I wasn't being rude being a realist Bing has pretty pictures on it that's not like about being when you go to their website and the iPhone app is actually kind of neat I don't have an iPhone really would you like to touch mine no it's got your finger juice on it yes you may okay have my story yay all right because this is the joy of the iPhone oh great now it's not loading sucker me at Miyamoto it basically what the story is about is that Miyamoto has always considered the maker of the Rubik's Cube mr. Rubik himself to be his rival so he wants to make something along the lines of a Rubik's Cube as his big pet project so like selling a bazillion wheeze isn't good enough no basically he said and I'm gonna quote for quite some time I have viewed professor Rubik who created the Rubik's Cube as a sort of rival I've always thought it would be cool to create something like a Rubik's Cube I've told lots of people about that for 20 years of us thought that the Rubik's cubes are great they've all left him and I wanted to make something like that but I still haven't tried to do so I must be taking it easy Wow and then he said he wanted to be a manga artist oh he just wants to do everything doesn't he you know what he's created some of the most memorable video game characters ever like that history will never forget some of these video game characters and yet it's just not good enough for him no and well he was said that he did some comic strips for um Tezuka who's the Nintendo ad general manager wait wait what which characters are you talking about that he created you know the ones that we would never forget was that like Captain Rainbow or something do you remember Captain Rainbow good point from a dark Tetsuya in chat room didn't Nintendo used to make toys and stuff back in the 70s actually Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda card yeah they did it playing cards right yeah hmm and then they did Game & Watch I love Game & Watch it works with Firefox well thank you now I enjoy your Microsoft points I will good time what are you gonna buy with those Microsoft points probably the rest of the steampunk outfit on my avatar all right Loki it's your turn you gonna put down plants versus zombies and actually sorry I can do this so there's other Sony news and this would kind of tie in with the stuff that happened before when they were moving things to stop hacking remember they removed the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3 to stop the hacking of the system via Linux well apparently there was a class-action lawsuit filed against Sony because of that and Sony has now filed a motion to dismiss that class-action lawsuit brought against the company and sadly enough I kind of agree with them because well you'll see for example they say that I guess apparently some of the seven I guess similar suits they were all consolidated their file last thing it says fails to present evidence that the company overtly advertise the other OS and its marketing campaigns on the p4 on the ps3 packaging which I don't remember them doing either one of those but I do remember them talking about it at e3 so or z3 or game developers conference camera which one this is Sony also claims that the ps3 warranty license agreement in the PlayStation Network terms of service specifically provide ps3 purchasers with a license non ownership interest in the software and use of the PlayStation Network provided that Sony has the right to disable or alter your software features or terminate or limit the access to the PlayStation Network it by issuing firmware updates and also I guess that apparently people do have the option to keep the other OS by declining the update and they just can't access the PlayStation Network so in other words in other words they're saying you can access this feature by disabling a different feature instead yes also they're saying that because some of the the they should you know dismiss the suit because some of the plaintiffs did not use the other OS feature in fact there is you have it didn't use it in the same way I guess and or just didn't use it all because you know they have ways of checking that and so I guess they wouldn't really have been affected by it it's some people I think doing a money grab if you ask me so I'm sure some people are just like that earlier story we had about APB and all the people complaining the yeah but there's some people that are gonna go try to get money that really didn't even play APB they just bought it well that's different though I mean they'd have proof of purchase of you know APB they give them the serial number or something like that that this is a little different than saying oh you know I I don't know like for example a class-action lawsuit that I was part of just because I hate 24-hour fitness I canceled my 24-hour fitness membership and there was a class-action lawsuit saying that there was people affected by the fact that when you cancel your membership they bill you a couple more times just really yeah did that happen to you no it didn't happen to me that's what I still got I got a $5 check I got a three month pass to 24-hour fitness I'm like oh garbage thank you it's like wonderful I can't wait to go back to the gym I don't like going to thank you this is way better than any other compensation you could possibly provide me nice very nice Lisa should be able to kick them in the pants or something yeah going to our chat room at chat orange laundry calm for such eloquent comments such as the one from Toa gak who says Sony can suck a dick what they did was wrong do you agree rice princess can Sony suck a dick they probably could collectively yeah let's see why not Derek H in our chair room says that's like a car company removing your seat belts because you didn't use them that's actually a pretty good comparison except for the fact that I don't think the other OS is gonna like you know save your life at any point I guess maybe it could I guess anything's possible don't make assumptions wrong all right going on to more stories in our show here another rumor going around and this is about more 3d games I know right I'm already over it but apparently there are yet more rumored ports of PlayStation 2 games being remade for the PlayStation 3 and in 3d one of them I've got to admit sounds really interesting it's the Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection and if you're looking at a sample box art that's out there it's Mortal Kombat 1 2 and ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 kind of redone in HD I gotta admit that being that I love the cheesy Mortal Kombat games from back in the day that actually sounds kind of awesome I'm not gonna lie being able to you know play that in three in well I wouldn't play in 3d but HD and all that jazz not interested rice princess you don't like Mortal Kombat it's alright I can play it in its normal form I guess that's true apparently it's gonna have stereoscopic 3d support and this is being reported by a French gaming website but they have box art to go with it and I don't know it's coming out oh well then I believe it what about the Prince of Persia trilogy 3d that's the other one that's being remember about that one yet only if it has video of Jake Gyllenhaal me I can imagine that they would because everybody's kind of jumping on that bandwagon of re-releasing stuff hey I'm okay with that Prince of Persia games are pretty awesome it's the sands of time or you're within and the two thrones all coming out sounds like they'd be a perfect tie in with the DVD release of the movie now wouldn't it wouldn't it and the Mortal Kombat HD collection might make the perfect companion piece to the new Mortal Kombat game wouldn't it how about Jake Gyllenhaal and the oncoming something I don't know never mind I try to make sex jokes around you Robin I just can't because I'm distracted by you it's I'm not sure how to take that but I think compliment interesting Derek H says they should remake every game with parallax backgrounds in 3d that might actually happen on the 3ds actually if what we saw at a most a classic gaming Expo I'd even fucking go to that what am I thinking at e3 is any indication cuz you know they had like the Xevious this old old old Namco game from like the 80s was redone in 3d pac-man yeah they had Star Fox was redone they were talking about like redoing ocarina of time they're gonna go back and redo all these games in 3d you know why it's because they can just take the code they already have tack on 3d and re-release a damn game again just like we can take some GameCube games tack on we remote waggle and re-release it hey look we're supporting the fans because we released lots of games this year new games uh oh I'm sorry that would actually be just game you've got to admit a game like pilot wings would be kind of awesome in 3d like I have to me okay here's the thing though rice friends let's keep this in mind I don't like 3d either like I don't like hearing about all these movies and things that are in 3d but the 3ds is for some reason is different like a you can turn off the 3d when it bugs you because it has a slider that lets you adjust the intensity so it's easier on your eyes and it is kind of a neat effect I gotta say being able to see the 3d without glasses is kind of cool I don't know how long that'll last but here's something that kind of has me thinking you know for the longest time we've been wondering where our virtual console games on the DSI where our virtual console games and virtual consoles kind of slowed up lately what if a lot of these re-releases with 3d end up being downloadable games for the DSI like they're gonna re-release these games all over again but this time they're in 3d I mean if the price is right like five ten dollars could be worth it for some of these games only the only the real real classics like I wouldn't buy games like princess tomato and salad Kingdom or whatever are what are you talking about my favorite game ever shut up no I wouldn't want to play clash and demon head in 3d no you're fixing something that's not broken I don't know it it's not worth it to me why would I pay for it again you know it was fine how it was before and you know if I want 3d I'll just go into real I hear they have 3d in real they apparently yes they do so I mean I don't know I'm just not down with the 3d I still want a 3ds though you got it you got to check one out when they you know I'll watch you play with now does it actually look like the stuffs coming out of the screen no it's going into the going in the screen it's like looking through a through a window into a three dimension imagine not like they're looking for a real window at the naked woman in the window your description of it makes me think of like the old head tracking thing with a wiimote hack that's what it makes me think of well if you think about how the 3ds really works with all the prisms and stuff basically sending a different image to each eye it kind of makes sense how it looks when you see it I know but some of it here's the thing but then some of the 3d effects what they do is they put the main image on the very very back plane so that way when there's 3d effects it does look like things are coming forward because they'll put the static image on the very last plane in the very back and then things are shooting out like there was one little demo they were showing out on the floor that was somebody opening a champagne bottle in slow motion and the champagne goes everywhere well it's just to show off the technology yeah like all I think of when I think of that is just Nintendo saying we're Nintendo give me your money give me your money people give them their money I know there's still one console and I'm just worried that this one this gimmick fades like it will that the 3ds I mean what's you know we you know you hope that would be around for a few years but it's just gonna die every seven-year-old is going to want one every single seven-year-old here's the thing though it doesn't matter that if it if the 3d stuff fails because the other thing they can do is they can have a nice because the top screen is like twice the resolution is the bottom screen they can have a nice HD screen or they can also just use the extra processing power to make really nice games well we'll see again a system is only as good as the games that are on it and there are a lot of very promising developers hopping in on it although again it's portable gaming and I'm not always the biggest fan of portable games but if it can give me something that the television games can't 3d in this case might be worth a look I don't know as if it has really really really great games that necessitated I'm gonna have to go well you can go ahead and spend your money I'm poor I'm just gonna have to go buy a virtual boy you can only steal one oh my god that's a great idea no bad idea never mind forget I said that all right let's go to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer is gonna open up the email bag dive in headfirst try not to drowned under the massive emails that are in there try not to inhale into the anthrax that comes with the messages you read a few all right this one is from lab rat y2k I just finished a journey into my own gaming vault this trip had me play earthbound mother in Japan for the SNES for the first time it's like they read rice princesses mind I know I can't speak highly enough of this game it had a great story and I found that I actually cared about the NPCs additionally I truly enjoyed the humor this is something that's been missing from most of the recent JRPGs if you haven't covered this on your retro gaming segment it would definitely be worth consideration lab rat y2k I concur greeting well now if you don't play it all the way to the very very end where you actually beat it then be careful because rice princess will make fun of you for the rest of your life so you better play it to completion it's true don't just play the first town like Rob did I played at least four towns are you sure about that I had a full party of people like you don't get that until like practically halfway through the game stop laughing at me bitch greetings again from Rob above hi I have been hoping and waiting for Verizon to get an iPhone contract because I'm shopping for a phone keep on waiting let's imagine that if it became reality I have some pretty good reasons to believe that apps that use the network for gaming or social networking will not work between AT&T and Verizon the only ones that will are the ones that push and pull things via the internet like Facebook or Twitter app I think this will be an eye-opening disappointment I hope I'm wrong imagine iPhones with babies from Rob above I know I'm not sure I follow the logic there why they wouldn't work because of them using the networks the time for networks I mean if the bandwidth is different than some network or some apps might have problems like things like Netflix and so forth but I would think that if a Verizon iPhone goes out of the marketplace the band was only gonna get better because there's you know gonna be more of it available there'll be a bunch of people that get off of AT&T's network that'll make it easier for them and then there'll be people on Verizon's now where it's kind of like you know spreading it out a little bit I don't know next email hey hey with the plans versus zombies talk on last show it brings to focus my addiction to the game on Steam looking over my playtime is almost depressing portal two hours half-life 2 one of the best first-person shooters made 44 minutes team fortress 2 2 hours torchlight 8 hours plants versus zombies game of the year edition 40 hours Wow hopefully I'll have the chance to give the other games the playtime they deserve in the meantime I'm really hoping that next year's plants versus zombies DS game will feature the multiplayer elements of the 360 release keep us big keep podcasting and stay something Robert M it's like the listeners are reading our minds this week with the whole like plants versus zombies like everybody's talking about how they've been playing that even though that game is a good year or two old at this point it's cuz you're psychic Rob shut up no no no okay greetings all our it's your favorite your friendly neighborhood turtle here I just wanted to thank you so much for the marathon show actually listen to the entire podcast in one long day of work I was worn out after that anywho I think the idea of Blizzcon is stupid but is anyone besides me pulling out their hair while waiting for any news about Diablo 3 back in the day of Diablo 2 I never used any form of voiceover IP and still spent hundreds of hours playing it I can't imagine the addiction this time around keep up the great work on the best structured most informational and best podcast running on the internet to your local your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle a serious turtle yes serious turtle I have been pulling my hair out over Diablo 3 in fact I've pulled out a whole little clump in the back in a nice little circle but I am I'm actually really excited about Diablo 3 all things considered it's it's been way too long since the first game World of Warcraft honestly feels like more like World of Diablo to me in the way it plays it's just in the Warcraft mythology so I'm I'm I'm very excited about Diablo 3 and I think I brought this up on the show before I think there's definitely when it comes to Blizzard two different camps there's the Starcraft people and there's a Diablo people and not a lot of crossover I appreciate Starcraft I bought it it's fun I see why people like it but I didn't really play it to completion because I never play games completion anymore let's face it but Diablo 3 oh it's on because you're not Korean yes it's because I'm not Korean no I'm reading anyway dear olr I was listening to Loki's failtastic Apple metaphor and thought I'd take a crack at it so I want to take me and a bunch of my friends out to a restaurant I could just get takeout and have a party at home but I like the experience that comes with dining out also I don't want my house getting trashed so I treat my friends to dinner at a semi-fine restaurant paying for the entire meal because I'm a nerd with a full-time job the restaurant presumably includes the cost of the dining experience waiters dishes silverware bad music random crap on the walls etc in with the cost of the meal because if people saw what this actually cost they might not choose to enjoy the dining experience this cost comes to me because I'm the one paying however if the restaurant is an establishment that makes each individual person pay for their own dining experience and I'm not going to stand out in front of a restaurant yell fuck you and fuck your fucking dining fee instead I will give my business to different restaurant that doesn't charge outrageous dining fees that ladies and gentlemen is how to craft a metaphor stay black entertainment this message is brought to you by 2x plus 2y minus 8 equals 4y solve for X the answer by the way is X equals 4y minus y plus 4 sorry you weren't here when that happened Danja we had a caller on the show and Dan was just like at the end like there was that awkward silence and Dan was like all right stay black have a good week you know we were just like what now I will explain my answer okay 2x plus 2y minus X for Y who cares I know she's wants to show off her skills no it's because I have these numbers running through my brain all the time now stupid algebra okay I want to I want to go back to the metaphor because it didn't really make any sense to me at all but I like the story cool story bro okay all right well is that it for the mail bag or do we have more emails that's all I'm gonna read well if you didn't get your email read how sad for you try again mail bag at orange lounge radio calm and you should like put at the top like dark soccer read this or I'll send you more math that's how you get her to read more emails threaten her with any meth no math because I could use the meth just a party all night all right now's the part of the show where we get angsty if he's the week I would like to say an fu2 holland and I give enough you two people are too slow to finish a transaction you know who I'm talking about person trying to buy something for somebody I paid them and now they're like oh I'm really busy right now yeah that's right I'll talk shit about them if they don't come through and they're in good if you did the fact that I'm having pains in my tooth like three days before I'm supposed to go to Disneyland and it's like I don't I really don't want to go to the dentist right now because it's gonna be so expensive and so I'm gonna be taking a big old box of oro gel with me good times it's not because of the licorice black licorice all right rice princess any f us tonight yeah if you to black licorice like I just said are you licorice racist hey I just don't you just hate all licorice equally I don't prefer to hang around black licorice okay that's okay because I hate all licorice equally oh I like red licorice also if you to 3d and the doctor lastly if you to money because I want more of it I don't have any right now oh but like you live in the middle of nowhere where rent is like $20 I know don't you even have a roommate now no I don't have a roommate anymore I thought you did yeah that ship sailed oh what happened was it bad it's we'll talk later oh you're my roommate now in the middle of nowhere Oh a party whoops prank party with Rob ship sailed okay some comments from chat room Rama says hey I'm black and I hate black licorice too and Derek H is calling you a liquor racist all right just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line is gonna be open at 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange launcher do but not yet because we have two more stories to go look yeah yes um I told people to get their dialing fingers ready they're dialing fingers it's like playing flame and finger I'm waiting Microsoft getting a taste of money because of halo reach has decided you know what maybe one halo game every three years not frequent enough we need to be putting out more halo games and they're saying you know probably I guess Phil Spencer this is Microsoft's VP they're saying it's a matter of keeping players engaged and not going dark for two years at a time they want to do what Activision has done with Call of Duty which is whore that bitch out like no other and they said I used to look at annual releases of non sports games as people just like just trying to milk me I figured nobody had enough time to do a good job and all the negatives that would associate with those kinds of scenarios kudos Activision because they've done a good job putting good game continuing to release each year I think the fans like it and it's a good thing that they do it that way that's because they had two different developers working on it I don't know if that's gonna work with halo do you think that halo is just gonna go really downhill now that a different studios gonna be developing it oh yeah I mean especially if it sounds like they're gonna try to crank them out as fast as possible that sounds dangerous just do not put roughing games on halo because they really fucked up crackdown too um do you think they're gonna try and crank out a halo game again as early as next year that because if that's the case and somebody's already working on it I don't know we'll have to see I it's just gonna get to the point though see with Call of Duty even you know the modern warfare was really awesome and then modern warfare 2 was still very awesome and world at war that came out in between that was just kind of like it's alright but still people went and played the one game so people aren't necessarily buying every year's you know iteration of the game and that's also another thing that's really hard to do it when you're putting a really good multiplayer game is like halo reach for example people will be playing halo region till the next halo game comes out but if it keeps coming out each year and if like some of them happen to suck or maybe are made by Treyarch then people might not give a shit anymore I just you know I hope they don't take a respectable name and really drive it into the ground but then again fresh blood isn't always a bad thing it could be cool just most of the time it could be cool but the thing is like Microsoft they need more franchises seein you know fables a great game I guess I fucking hate peeler Molinos so much why he's such a prick seriously our game is so awesome it does all these things other games don't do you're gonna really care for this dog really I cared so much I stopped playing months ago this dog's gonna come your life no he's annoying he's like hey dig here there's treasure here dig here dig here dig here there's treasure here you can raise your family and it's so wonderful this time you're gonna be able to be the king or queen of your kingdom you have to run it and things are gonna happen you're gonna have your dog still because everybody loves dog and and it's really amazing and we're gonna do this project Milo shit that's gonna be so wonderful you're gonna interact with this kid like you're interacting with a real kid don't play with your kids your kids can interact with this kid just like you're interacting with real friends because they don't have real friends oh he's just so annoying with his leg new technology and shit and I'm sorry like here's the thing he comes out saying that these games are gonna be so much more incredible than the last game because of all these reasons and they're like nearly identical to the last year's release it's like what happened all this innovation that you're gonna put in there because this game is kind of terrible well no and why don't we go back to the original scrap Milo because yeah that's stupid and creepy and we can do we can do the we'll get an adult guy an adult woman and then integrate porn into the games I'm glad that they were able to show off this wonderful tech demo where they can interact with a child and stuff but like if you actually heard about what the game was supposed to be about it was stupid it was just like oh you interact with this child and if you help them find snails because he's moved here from it from isn't that connect animals no no no they make my little okay it's not connect to humans okay it's a child it's a real boy like Pinocchio he wants to be a real boy but he's just digital and you interact with him he helped by snails because he's just so depressed from flying here from I think he was coming from Britain or something like that and somewhere in England flying from England doesn't know anybody and his parents are going through some hard times maybe divorce or something and that's this is way more anger than I was anticipating your Jeff Goldblum voice is just no it's is it's the Peter molyneaux voice that's how he talks going to chat that orange hundred calm salacious pop says damn Loki why you mad though amazed that suma says Loki's British accent sucks it's not a project it's a Peter molyneaux accident oh he talked dark Tetsuya says well I think Loki's British accent beats Rob's I'm not trying to sound British I'm trying to sound like Peter moly no I'm Mel B and today we're going to be talking about fable Rob this bloody old fool bloody old fool she's trying to do also buy my new game L be blah blah blah girl power let's put another girl through patience you know remember when he is pimping out halo or not halo yeah it's pimping out halo Milo in there no no he was pimping out fucking fable to he's like oh no I'm gonna show you something very innovative it's a ball you play you play fetch with the dog with the ball it's like I can fucking do that now with my dog I don't have a dog I can throw a ball at my cat and it's way more entertaining than playing who's like who seriously is gonna go into halo and play fetch your fucking dog for hours on end is this what I'm really paying money for is to play fetch my fucking dog mm-hmm granted it was fun killing people or like torturing them in this little like you know device you can sacrifice real life you can kill people in real life you act like it's impossible it's entirely possible we have salacious pop in chat says that this is Loki right now actually this is Loki right now I apologize that that was very low volume playing YouTube I bet you anything though that fable 3 is going to be very very very very very similar to fable 2 ok dark soccer is finally giving me back my clue DVD it's only been two years since she's had it no Rob it's been longer feels like you have like three movies in here me too I'm gonna watch this when I get home no I'm not I'm gonna play Wow don't joke with us like alright can I do one more story that we can open up the skyline sure alright Nintendo will sue at least that's what they've been doing this week threatening to do they've been threatening Pokemon fan sites who have been posting Pokemon black and white screenshots the game came out in Japan and of course you know folks have been importing it and have been posting screenshots of it on their fan sites but Nintendo has brought down the legal hammer of justice with a cease and desist saying quote while Nintendo appreciates your interest in and support of the Pokemon game series your publication of this content infringes Nintendo's copyrights in violation of federal law your activity also and has the potential caught to cause substantial damage to Nintendo and leaves Nintendo with no choice but to take steps to protect its intellectual property rights some of the sites that were hit poker beach pokey beach I don't know and your beach poker be check up your Pokemon sorry be I don't know if that's one of the names of the Pokemon is Siri be or something and of course they're very upset no and this is awesome because Nintendo is so epically horrible at advertising their own stuff now yes they're going to get pissed off apparently when other people actually try to advertise for them like that's that's amazing it's also kind of disturbing to me that it's like well the game's out somewhere but hold on because there was an update that came out to this that might kind of shed a little light on it and it was you know some various commenters on websites were kind of noticing that the sites that got shut down were admitting to using ROMs to get the screens so maybe the problem wasn't that they were posting screenshots but it's admitting how they did it by getting ROMs of an import game I mean still screenshots are just screenshots and the game is already out but you know if you're gonna go around openly saying I stole the game what if I said you know I wished upon a magic lamp and the gene granted me this copy of the game are they gonna shut down my Pokemon site now well then maybe I don't know I mean I could say that it fell from the sky in a blaze of glory or you just don't say how you got the screenshots at all you just post them I mean isn't that what most websites do but Rob that would be like they get their exclusive report we got the exclusive photoshop those those are photoshop I don't believe that Pokemon has that in there also keep in mind that the DSI pokie shopped version was region locked for for black and white I'm so black and blue is the Pokemon bruise y'all know Shane right yeah on the show a few times he's playing Pokemon black and white right now on his Japanese DS yeah yes it's the or no no it's yeah he's playing it on an older one that isn't region locked cuz only like the newer ones are region locked so he has an old DS so it's not Japanese DS was no one get on his XL I don't know he's he's playing it one way or another is that's all he ever post that on Facebook anymore seriously this pokey man if you're listening if you're listening call in so we can get a review on Pokemon black and white although all he's gonna say he's gonna say it's awesome why cuz it's awesome why cuz it's Pokemon and they're awesome well there's the review that's gonna be it right shame loves his pokey man's tweet them to you all right shall we open up the skype line do it let's do it and here here's that commercial I was referring to earlier is I've seen this commercial on real television pick up the phone and call us now one eight seven seven game ol I should do this

they need to stop making controller simple as that what stuff falls apart within like two three months yeah that would suck if I put a pair of um symbols from my drop for my own rock band drum set they stopped working within three months are they pretty cheap though I mean is it like you get what you pay for something like that I mean the current I got him replaced and I use them sparingly and as they're starting to act up a little bit here and there well they have updated them for the rock band three drum set since they actually included with that now and they're supposed to be more sensitive once rock band three out I want to play it so bad makes two more weeks it's like a 16th or some oh wait I'm getting a comment from rice princess here in the background what's that rice princess I was just saying that Rama was a piece of sexual chocolate oh thank you my dear I love you too speaking of a rock band I have to plug the umlaut that's coming up in December it's this thing they do in San Francisco at the DNA lounge where you can actually like you I don't want to say rent the stage but you sort of do like you get to play a song on stage in front of like all the people that are there it's like a concert where you're a band so I'm thinking the doctor and rice princess and I should do a band would it be fun yay I tried to get my friend Victoria to do it but she's kind of being flaky flake on it no I would definitely do that would you yeah oh heck yeah but we have to dress up okay enter grok side yeah what does it dark sakura we need to do it we need a fourth dark sakura what would I do with my bro drums oh you can't do drums oh my god it'll be like I'm fucking monocle all over again you can do interpretive dance Beatles rock band harmony like rock star saying I was just grimacing musically okay good stuff I think this is gonna have to happen what do you think Rama you have to get on stage to see in front of hundreds of people know it what's that I said I'm all for it awesome awesome I have to get over my stage right now you'll be fine just put a paper bag on your head and cut out little like like like in um um guitar hero you can do on guitar freakin um put a bucket of chicken thing on your head it's hard like bucket head there you go no I'm talking I was you know like the little icon guys from guitar freaks you know that game that was made by that could be our band name guitar freaks was first well if you want I give you permission to use my band name what's that rhythm in Jews Rama Jews have no rhythm come on come on I tease because I suggested that I could play with one arm like the drummer for a definitely actually that's an amazing idea because what you should do you should do that whole thing where you put your hand through your shirt so it looks like you don't have an arm awesome because he has a floor pad maybe we can put it on the floor and I can hit it with my feet only if you only if you kick your legs back in a wheelchair it's not like your lieutenant Dan it's it's Halloween time so he she could we go to a Halloween store and get you one of those fake arms always been lobbed off I'll be awesome that's okay it was a good idea at the time I know right we'll just get dark soccer good and drunk before she goes on stage alright drunk I won't be able to say why do I get a drug just bribe her with Guinness that here's the best part guys this doesn't get me they stream loud on the internet so all of you could watch never mind I'll get the recorder ready and it'll be good act F suggests instrument freaks or band freaks which is facts maniacs which is great because there's people from harmonics that actually go to the event and it would be extremely offensive if we named although I don't know if any people are harmonious is they're wonderful people but it would be funny could be freaky guitarists we could be the five seven threes we know we could be the Spice Girls we could dress up as Spice Girls more like the shy girls I get to be Jerry that's all all right forget it hi Rama anything else you want to share with our listeners I just got one thing to say I'm gonna quick I'm tired of everybody bitching at me that I jump on the Skype lane first for everybody else if you don't want me on almost every single week call in and be relevant about something I was gonna say it has

we'll just see you wait for a call I don't think I've ever been here when nobody's called yeah but oh my god there's no one calling today oh no oh now it's lighten up okay good crazy all right oh you're on orange lounge radio thanks for calling now you're on with the doctor what's going on may I have the Spanish option for for what oh la bienvenidos a orange lounge radio telephono s en fuego Rob Rob s muy caliente literally brain Telemundo that's all I know Lune smart a smear go away actually you find this really funny this is act f2 course right yeah you know what's funny is now I'm seeing cuz Skype is popping up like all these people who have never called the show before are starting to call in so we're gonna have to make this call quick so you get to some more people but I just want to quickly throw this out here do you know how we used to learn Spanish in high school you'd probably get a kick out of this no I haven't okay there's this little song and I still remember it to this day and it's how you learn how to conjugate verbs okay you ready vamos hablar el verbo kami nar kami nar kami nar to walk yo kami no tu kami nace el kami nay it was dead Tom B and I still remember this song to this day is pathetic French horrible what did you think didn't have any song what did you think of the verb conjugation song wasn't it awesome oh yeah all right so speaking of video games what's up in video game world yeah video games so interesting oh I wanted to talk about a story to talk about last week about a certain video game side that sells all games ah yes that site that went up and down and then up again oh I think they're still down though because we're definitely not covering the story that they came back I'm aware that they're still down there went my final story of the night oh what would you want to say about the site that shall not be named well not necessarily about the site but about like steam and other sites like I don't remember the other right direct to drive also that sell games the digital distribution distribution well I'm you know it has a lot of people kind of thinking about digital distribution with the website going down it's kind of like a lot of people were giving it second thought like gee is one day all my games just going to suddenly stop working now to be fair I believe the games that the website got me with a pitchfork was selling they were DRM free right and then steam has always said if they ever go down they do have this magic key that will unlock the DRM and all the games and they have like a panic button they can hit they'll automatically make all the games DRM free and I'm surprised hackers haven't found it yet but it must be I think they might have it must be a patch or something I don't know but you know they there is a way out but yeah it's kind of worrying because I have a lot of games I have bought and given to me on steam so I kind of I kind of worry about that where I think it's going to be down someday I think you'll be okay if you read the terms of service for steam it sounds like you'll be okay now here's the one you would worry about honestly if I were you was be that on live as neat as that service is and this scale cool as it looks at the whole streaming game through the internet or whatever when you buy those games you're basically buying the game on someone else's computer and if that service ever goes down you're gonna lose that game now I think they've excuse me they've guaranteed it for what like three years I think but that's you know after that three years you may not have the game anymore which you know after three years you may not want to play the game anymore but I don't know there's some games I want to go back and visit after a long time like the very first civilization I could still play that game it's great and no I didn't place it five this week I'm a bad sieve fan anyhow well good thing on live it's it's I think it's not available in Mexico so I don't have to worry about that hopefully someday as always get last in line I'm sorry yeah all right well any other thoughts before we let you go no that's pretty much it all right you have a good one and I hope you enjoyed the new Kirby game when it comes out because I know you're gonna be fan all right it's in your icon in case I forgot take care one eight seven seven game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio sorry doctor I kind of took over that call that's right go ahead yes that's hot that's hot I'm gonna be I'm gonna be really horny tonight so it's okay well this concludes another episode of orange lounge radio all right no just kidding one eight we still have time for a few more calls one eight seven seven two game olr or our username on skype excuse me orange lounge radio and to those of you guys I saw some first-time callers trying to get through so we'll see if we can't get some of these calls here again that's one eight seven seven another call olr or a username on skype is orange laundry yes that is a call coming in right now let's take it thank you for calling orange lounge radio right you're online with the doctor what's up hey this is entertainment hey what's up what's on your mind I want to bitch about PSN for a second okay right on well I got move and I downloaded a couple demos because I didn't get the $99 package with the demo disk in it okay so I I set this up to download overnight and usually I can go to work or set stuff to download overnight on live and it'll be done when I wake up or get home so I wake up and the thing is and my PlayStation 3 is still on I'm serious it's still trying to download well no it downloaded overnight but it took at least eight hours because I went to sleep about 2 a.m. and left to go see a movie at about 11 and it was still on oh wait what was it you were trying to download just the the patch or seven seven demos for move Wow and none of them were any bigger than about three hundred fifty max it wasn't the same no it wasn't the same day the network went down right it's just it maybe they were just getting hammered I don't know that's so it's kind of freaky you know you can buy full games on PSN can she has like gigs and gigs of data that would just take you hours like you could just go out the door drive to the mall downtown and back in less time than it would take for the stupid game to download digital distribution might not really be the wave of the future just yet it works for the smaller games like on Xbox Live Arcade and you know some of the smaller PSN games but that's crazy I imagine just a bunch of people were hitting it all at once but it's kind of surprising they don't have a better backup system you know for that well a lot of people must be trying to download the heavy rain move patch now because I triggered it to download at about 9 o'clock which is 8 Pacific and it's been about an hour and it says it's 16% complete and it will take 324 minutes left oh that's ridiculous do you have points running I mean maybe your porn torrents are clogging everything that could be the job no the only thing I'm doing right now is I'm calling you on my iPad huh and that's it this is pretty good quality for an iPad I must say huh well I I don't know sir I you could call Sony and complain or you could just bitch about it on internet forums like you're doing now yeah most people are going to be doing I mean what can you do the internet is for yeah exactly it's for bitching anonymously on internet forums about your products yeah anything else you want to complain about while you're on no I was I did finally play some of the demos and they're really good the tumble demo is really nice mm-hmm and so is ruse which is kind of what I've always wanted from wiimote from out of the week do you think it's do you think that this the PlayStation might have a serious competitor here to the Wii I don't know it all depends on the games right right but it sounds like you were enjoying a couple of these demos yeah the ruse demo is kind of this militaristic strategy game which I might have to pick that up when it finally comes out I don't know I still haven't got the move myself yet maybe maybe at some point or I'll just go over to Loki and play his that sounds like an even better idea right Loki yeah all right I haven't even played mine yet any other last thoughts before we let you go that's about it all right just don't forget to turn off the port hopefully someday I will be able to play heavy rain with move all right well let us know maybe next week and maybe it might take that long all right good luck take care of you too all right one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call give us a call let's walk I like this little icon on skype because it was Dario no let's start you you love Dario right I do all right doctor you ready for another call sure all right you're online with orange lounge radio this is the doctor what's up hello it's salacious pop hey what's up salacious pop that much I'm calling in so everyone can hear my hot sexy I have a chest cold bro voice ah dude I love the bro voice yeah I'm gonna go put on like a Dave Matthews band CD and put on a visor sideways like a great visual yeah keep talking keep talking I was calling about Ronda's comment that mad cats really just needs to stop making controllers okay I have a little story about that awesome I used I bought one of their like eight and one memory sticks for the Dreamcast where it has a switch on it it died after like a month it deleted all my saves no I love that it not only died but it deleted them that's that's amazing yeah and then since he was talking about controllers I bought a Blanca six button the fighting pad for the 360 when Street Fighter 4 came out and I got it off I think eBay it was brand new it was in like the horrible clamshell where you need like a box cutter and a living sacrifice to get the fuck it's open and meanwhile you break the product is you're opening yeah yeah it didn't work like it was just dead out of the box the 360 was like I don't know what the fuck you just connected to me but this is doubt it get that get this away from me so I said like 40 bucks on a mad cat's controller that was just dead like that's awesome so they need to stop very good yeah I agree with all those stories I would probably buy one just to you know step on it and kick the grass room I can hear Rob giggling hi hi feel better fine also since you guys are talking about the Tomb Raider reboot I really think that no one Kerr about Lara Croft anymore and that they need to put that franchise to bed because there are so many bad games associated with that hold on you enjoyed that Lara Croft in the guardian light game as much as I did unless you were lying for my benefit no see that's the thing that's an awesome game no it is but because it has Lara Croft and Tomb Raider attached to it like that's the brand people are gonna go oh you know what's this shit and they're not gonna buy it I think that's what if if that co-op game was put under a new IP with new characters people would go oh this is a great game because it is but just the Tomb Raider games for the ps2 were awful three four five for the ps1 were awful so I just feel that this kind of box office poison like I don't know she's Lara Croft is Lara Croft is the M night Shyamalan of video games you pretty much like they just they don't care you know she was genre breaking in 96 with her you know platforming and her bad pyramid tips but now no one cares no wonder no one care about Lara Croft which is which is a shame because I think that you know I'd often still put out good games with her it's just that she as an icon is bringing their ideas down I don't know do you think maybe they got one more chance like maybe this reboot if it's really good maybe people can look past it and forgive or no it's over put it pasture didn't I thought the game the adventure game that they put out for her last year or the year before I think it's for the ps3 was also supposed to be really good but like again I've never really heard of that like once it came out no one cared and it never really broke any sales charts so I think it may just be a done deal I guess with the reboot if they'd have to put a lot of money into marketing it to say like no really guys this was actually good or just put the topless patch in honestly and then boys everywhere want to play right just just release it on PC in the skidding community will take care of that for them there you go all right anything else you want to share with the listeners nope that's it I managed to stave off having a coffee fit for a good two minutes so I think now's a good time to leave okay feel better better get better or Disneyland so I can spin you around in a teacup yay I'll throw up on you awesome all right bye okay bye one eight seven seven game olr that's really he's funny he's funny he's a good guy yes Orange Launch Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call oh we're back to being British again hello Rob what we doing tonight I'm going to our chat room at chat that orange lounge radio calm Frisbee going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio calm Frisbee in our chat room says pyramid tits I smell a new Silent Hill monster oh good lord yeah how do you smell that all the way from where you're at that's kind of that's a little bit freaky I don't know you know so did you have any other last minute stories Loki each you want to get to sure hold on we get more calls now it's lighting up like crazy let's get to another call doctor you ready yep thank you for calling orange lounge radio you're online with the doctor what's up hey what's up suppose what's that I'm on with the doctor you're on with the doctor I'm the doctor is there any aliens I need to be worrying about them ah there's tons of aliens dude I got my son a screwdriver and I'm ready to go oh shit I gotta run we better because there is an awful lot of running so we definitely need to do that so besides the aliens what's going on tonight with you wait who is that hi who is this this is zappy hi zappy how are you I'm pretty good okay I'll let's talk to doctor yet okay well the reason was talking good call in was because it's sort of related to what rare team was talking about before is because I have a copy of ruse but for the Xbox 360 and let me tell you that controller is in isn't cutting it like it's I can see it's a really good game but you're just being held back by the horrible horrible controls like I select my units and always picking the wrong ones and it's just not working I could see that because that's a lot of games in game room are kind of like that a lot of Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 kind of made me think that because it was just so awful to try and control but it's kind of a bummer that that controller really ruins some games and what pisses me off is because I didn't know that they're gonna have a PlayStation move and that would probably work a lot better than trying to you know it's basically like having a big anchor and being thrown off the side of the boat you're kind of being dragged down to the bottom the ocean there well now what do you think though about this new Xbox 360 controller they're supposed to be putting out that has the whole like yeah you just twist it and then it's like a different d-pad it looks like a big gimmick to charge me $65 isn't that terrible that they're only bound bundling it with that dumb play in charge or whatever it is like oh it's so annoying how they do this just like it's just like Nintendo doing that new Nintendo remote with Wii Plus or whatever with a crappy tennis knockoff game I mean really that's yeah but at least the Wii Sports Resort was at least you know fun that's true I don't know I didn't play a lot of that very seriously because I kind of gave up on the way I haven't had my Wii plugged in and like over a year which is really sad because I wanted to play Metroid but I just I can't bring myself to hook up the new Nintendo Wii. God dammit you're lazy. Somewhere deep in Nintendo America's headquarters, Reggie is amazed crying himself to sleep after that. but the problem is like I have heard nothing but bad things about the new Metroid and it's making me a little weird well I've heard a few good things here and there but I'm a little scared because like Super Metroid is like the Holy Grail of video games to me and oh yeah I love Super Metroid and if they botched it like I'm I'm really really sad like my experience with new Metroid was about five minutes at Best Buy and it seemed okay but I have five minutes I can't really say here or there could be good just wouldn't kind of made me honest yeah you can't base an entire review of a game off of just five minutes you know cuz I'm sure everybody at E3 loved it you know the lines to play that game at E3 were like hours long it was almost as long as the 3ds line at some points because it was moving a little slower really it's not like I guess the people who couldn't get into the 3ds line said okay I'll sell from Metroid yes yes maybe not hours but like at least an hour it's crazy how long lines get there that reminds me I'm getting my wallet ready this week to find out how much they'll be raping me out of my wallet for the 3ds oh is that are they announcing a date this week well I'm hearing there and finally announced it like in the middle of this week I think was Wednesday that's right because Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo game show right but they always do their own little kind of like spin-off right they do their own little fan event around the same time so that makes sense so I'm kind of like basically unless they're like charging a thousand bucks they basically got me locked down for that thing I gonna say it's probably gonna be 249 and it's gonna come with a like either I think it'll be like kind of like a tech demo II type of game that's just a bunch of like the movie trailers and some of the tech demos they were showing it on 3ds and then like ocarina of time in 3d or some old-ass Nintendo IP that they can just easily do as the pack in the game well they got me at launch for DS and I bought the PSP within three months of launch so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna pick this up do you regret buying either of those systems maybe the PSP a little bit you know the DS I had been having like as a paperweight for the last six months there really hasn't been anything coming out this year for it no yeah they didn't really show a lot of d3 either because there it's all about the 3ds now you know and except for the little girl games like fancy Nancy yeah that's like the only thing that seems interesting coming out is maybe Pokemon in black and white well that's true that's gonna be a big deal when it comes out well otherwise I just don't see my fancy all right well zappy any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go tonight um don't buy ruse on the 360 the PC is probably the best choice and maybe the PlayStation move version all right word of warning of caution to the listeners all right you have a good one zappy thanks for the call later later later all right that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight thank you guys so much for all the calls tonight sorry to those that didn't get through like you should have called when we first opened it cuz it was wide open I'm so sorry guys but we had a wrap up and get my friend Frodo got through at the very beginning clearly yeah we would yeah by the way for those that are angry they didn't get through on tonight you can thank that first call for eating up 30 seconds of your time just so you know there you go I know quickly any other last-minute stories they'll give us to get out any plants versus zombies action dark soccer wants to share I'm currently owning a bunch of zombies you know what that game needs and maybe it has it and I don't know multiplayer I'm the Xbox 360 version it does does it it they've added it yeah that's cool I might have to play it on the 360 player I'm just playing a little puzzle mode I don't know if this is mentioned before because I've been paying a lot of attention plants versus zombies is now becoming a quest in World of Warcraft capitalism mm-hmm so that's pretty awesome peace bloom versus ghouls or whatever they're calling it it's hilarious I want the sunflower pet not gonna lie also there is a fan release of the command conquer 3 the forgotten it's a brand new expansion for command and conquer 3 and the best part about it it's fan made so go check it out at the forgotten dot CNC labs calm and check out the new units and different things you get to play around with so that's kind of cool you said unit also World of Warcraft yes mobile guild chats coming to World of Warcraft I believe via the World of Warcraft armory which is an iPhone iPad or iPod Android device app and you probably have to pay the premium that you have to pay it is a $2.99 monthly subscription fee yeah yeah not gonna lie though it's yes it's extremely homosexual well I'm not to be honest I'm not gonna lie it actually sounds kind of cool like you being able to sign on and just say hey hey I don't know just sign up for some other sort of I'm sure there's other voice chat options perhaps through sky I'm not really gonna get it I mean through Skype totally free and I'm sure you can do you know some sort of party chat with that ventrilo on the iPhone that's why do they have that chatters Oh Amiga seven seven says you mean it's homotextual that was funny I like that so cute the baby not I know I know all right anything else you want to share with Loki the last minute stories no hey dark Sakura anything you've got over there yeah that's what I thought more plants versus zombies well that's gonna do it for another episode of orange lounge
