1
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:18,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, September 5th, 2010, the 360 is set to get a new controller.

2
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:25,016
[SPEAKER_00]: News from PAX includes the return of a long-forgotten game franchise, and could comic books be coming to the PS3?

3
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:37,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:40,777
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:48,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And joining you over the next several, many, long hours, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes going by Sky in our chatroom and so forth.

6
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:52,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

8
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:54,011
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

9
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on podcast number two for the day.

10
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, yes.

11
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,757
[SPEAKER_09]: You're having quite the podcasting day, but we'll get to that in a minute.

12
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:01,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

13
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have to introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.

14
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:05,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

15
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:06,564
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

16
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:07,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

17
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:09,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I made an observation this morning.

18
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:10,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to confirm.

19
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:10,948
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that?

20
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anybody remembers the guy, Reginald Vel Johnson.

21
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:17,014
[SPEAKER_07]: You may remember him.

22
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Was he the dad on Family Matters?

23
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,217
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the dad on Family Matters.

24
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:20,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

25
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I'm a pop culture sponge.

26
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:29,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, I was watching Ghostbusters today because they were playing it on Comedy Central, and he was a cop in that.

27
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:29,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like...

28
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:33,329
[SPEAKER_07]: How many fucking movies and shows has he been a damn police officer in?

29
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's always a goddamn police officer in everything.

30
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:38,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite a few, actually.

31
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:42,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Die Hard 1, Die Hard 2, and Ghostbusters, as well as Family Matters.

32
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:47,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, I'd have to go through the rest of these to figure out, you know, which ones of these.

33
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,473
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually a police officer, but it just has his name on there.

34
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:53,035
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just weird.

35
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:53,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

36
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:54,797
[SPEAKER_09]: What has he done lately?

37
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:57,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we get him on the show, maybe, to do some voiceovers?

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,462
[SPEAKER_09]: He was also in Die Hard Vendetta, the video game.

39
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:03,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, bringing it back to games.

40
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:03,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it.

41
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:04,265
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

42
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:07,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the next many hours, we are going to be talking about video games.

43
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:24,355
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually having an early start, so we are live at All Games Radio.

44
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:30,578
[SPEAKER_09]: We do tape live every Sunday at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, usually.

45
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:34,999
[SPEAKER_09]: But today it's 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern, and we're starting to show a little bit early.

46
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 10 o'clock in England.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, 10 at night.

48
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:42,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally we're getting kind of an earlier show in for them, so I hope some folks overseas are listening too.

49
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:47,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're going to actually try to go late tonight.

50
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how late.

51
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,105
[SPEAKER_09]: The goal is midnight tonight.

52
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:51,576
[SPEAKER_09]: We might go longer.

53
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,257
[SPEAKER_09]: We might go not as long.

54
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:54,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

55
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:55,479
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

56
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're doing the marathon episode.

57
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:57,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

58
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:58,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we can.

59
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:00,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

60
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,865
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a fundraiser for anything.

61
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:04,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you should donate to charities.

62
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Do good in your life.

63
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:11,192
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're just doing this for fun because everybody else is at some freaking convention this weekend.

64
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're having a little mini festival of our own.

65
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,717
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have some guests joining us in studio here today.

66
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how long they'll be with us.

67
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he'll be with us the whole time.

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello to Salacious Pop or Alan.

69
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

70
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:24,683
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

71
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Much better than last time.

72
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:26,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

73
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:27,745
[SPEAKER_09]: What was wrong last time?

74
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I had food poisoning when I was on the show.

75
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:30,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

76
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,389
[SPEAKER_09]: You were recovering from the Reno trip.

77
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:32,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

78
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:33,890
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're feeling much better today.

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

80
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:34,711
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

81
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was a little worried about that because we're doing this marathon today.

82
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,373
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't really plan it out very well.

83
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:42,454
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, hey, let's broadcast for 12 hours.

84
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:43,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

85
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:45,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, when are we going to eat?

86
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:47,356
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

87
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:50,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully Dan is going to be back at some point where we'll be able to kind of rotate in and out.

88
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So learn with us here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

89
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:55,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Just order a pizza.

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put the pizza guy on the show.

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about games.

92
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:01,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I'm going to get fired.

93
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:01,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

94
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,263
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

95
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't that Dan couldn't have the sodium, we could totally just do a take and bake.

96
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Send Dan off to be our errand boy.

97
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:09,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

98
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:10,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

99
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Papa Murphy's.

100
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

101
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Also joining us, say hello to Bradley, our KDN42.

102
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,534
[SPEAKER_01]: You said there'd be surprises.

103
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:18,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the first one.

104
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:18,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

105
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:19,916
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

106
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:25,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You were on the show a couple months ago, but before that you weren't on for a couple years.

107
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a few months ago, I don't remember.

108
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:27,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were.

109
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:31,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last time I was on was at your house.

110
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:33,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was a while ago.

111
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:34,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought for some reason.

112
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:34,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.

113
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

114
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you maybe mentioned me because I was here for her party or something before that.

115
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, that might have been it.

116
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:40,136
[SPEAKER_01]: That might have been it.

117
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just popped in the chat room like once or twice.

118
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,381
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

119
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:44,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's new with Bradley?

120
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:45,343
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you up to?

121
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:49,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I haven't been playing any games this last week because I was on the road.

122
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:52,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like a seven-day trip of National Parks.

123
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:52,913
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

124
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:13,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next one was Theodore Roosevelt, which I just kind of drove around.

125
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:20,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the next day was Rocky Mountain, where you go up like 12,000 feet when you're driving.

126
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Arches, which has all the natural arches in it.

127
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:25,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And Canyonlands, which is a big canyon.

128
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:30,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Also was, what's the next one after that?

129
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:33,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Was Coral Reef, or Capital Reef.

130
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:36,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Bradley, I'm thinking you should just be a park ranger.

131
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:39,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, can't you see Bradley as a park ranger?

132
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I could totally see that.

133
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:44,128
[SPEAKER_09]: He'd just be in his cabin during the winters with the Xbox and what have you.

134
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, let me give a little background on Orange Lingerie.

135
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:57,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we have a lot of extra time today, I can kind of do that for the people who haven't listened in a very, or just now listening, or you haven't heard this story because you haven't told it in a long time.

136
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what Orange Lingerie is all about.

137
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:00,940
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki,

138
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

139
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,925
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR is still around, but the culture isn't quite the same as it used to be back in my day.

140
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:45,369
[SPEAKER_09]: But we decided to start a show about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution and that whole scene.

141
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way the show was for about the first, what, about three, four years we were doing that?

142
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:52,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Then when podcasting came around, we got into doing that.

143
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:53,455
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to do a spinoff show.

144
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:57,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a spinoff show of our main show about just video games in general.

145
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:04,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that kind of took off and ended up kind of taking over the DDR part when music games and so forth...

146
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,545
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

147
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:26,384
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

148
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,206
[SPEAKER_09]: and all the ways you guys can interact with us and give us your opinion.

149
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,855
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because we're technologically able.

150
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the technology.

151
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We can repair something.

152
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:08,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Something, something.

153
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:09,316
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

154
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:13,557
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, the reason why I give that background is that we all kind of bring different things to the table.

155
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:15,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We all like different types of games.

156
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: For instance, DarkSakura, she does the classic game of the week here on the show every week because she has a vast brain full of useless video game trivia and these obscure-ass import games even I don't hear of ever, so...

157
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,821
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of her background, right?

158
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:34,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that kind of a fair assessment?

159
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:35,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

160
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:45,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Loki, speaking of random trivia, he has been in nine different shows or series playing a law enforcement officer.

161
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:50,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, the one in Ghostbusters, he was a prison guard, but goddammit, that's close enough.

162
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:53,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So, nine different series or movies.

163
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have to be an officer to be a prison guard?

164
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a law enforcement job.

165
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,413
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's a lot.

166
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:02,854
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just really typecast.

167
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, enough talking about him.

168
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to talk about him anymore.

169
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Promise?

170
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:06,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Promise.

171
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have a good 12 hours to do so.

172
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're not staying the whole time.

173
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:14,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Loki is kind of... I see him as more of our tech, hack, crack...

174
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,611
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a way to break the game, he will, kind of guy.

175
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:22,475
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the guy that probably bought a Game Genie as soon as they were out to see how he could screw up the game.

176
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:23,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought one, though.

177
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be kind of a fair assessment of what you're all about?

178
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure.

179
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:28,280
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

180
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And then me, I don't know.

181
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:32,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up on Commodore 64 and all the old school games.

182
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like to think of myself as kind of like a retro-y gamer as well.

183
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:36,987
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like a lot of new stuff, too.

184
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I think lately it's been MMOs.

185
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:39,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played a lot of them.

186
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:41,971
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot of like computer games too.

187
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not all of them, but I try to do them.

188
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just kind of a little bit of everything.

189
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:53,961
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the reason why I kind of lay all that out is I want to ask Bradley, what types of games do you bring?

190
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,262
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your gaming background?

191
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,804
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your likes and dislikes in gaming?

192
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

193
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:21,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool deal, cool deal.

194
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:29,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I always think it's a bad idea when people go around saying, I hate all sports games, or I hate sports video games.

195
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Sports video games are crap.

196
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:39,223
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people on this show, it may not be the preference of the types of games we play most of the time, but I think it would be a lie to say I hate all sports games, because I

197
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:42,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I love NBA Jam, and I love that it's coming back.

198
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a way to make it very nice and simple for you.

199
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:58,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like racing games, how you have your arcade racing games, which are fun to play, and your simulation racing games, which require you to be able to drive and tune a car with the same precision that you would a real car.

200
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:01,876
[SPEAKER_07]: You hate simulation sports games.

201
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:04,618
[SPEAKER_07]: You do like arcade-style sports games, though.

202
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:06,539
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually makes a lot of sense.

203
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:12,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And then over there, those folks, usually it's like, oh, well, I hate all those Japanese RPGs.

204
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,222
[SPEAKER_09]: There's too much of the same stuff.

205
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:17,183
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe I'll play Final Fantasy.

206
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:22,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play that one that is kind of out in the mainstream.

207
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:23,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Or music games.

208
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:26,086
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are like, that arrow stomping?

209
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:26,766
[SPEAKER_09]: No, what is that?

210
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,827
[SPEAKER_09]: That Japanese rave-y techno music?

211
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:29,287
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

212
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:29,767
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

213
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:33,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sort of see that as the hardcore music games, like Beatmania 2DX.

214
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,170
[SPEAKER_09]: is a hardcore music game.

215
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,334
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure everybody has enjoyed Guitar Hero at least once, a rock band at a party, drunk, right?

216
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:42,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's kind of interesting.

217
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,055
[SPEAKER_09]: This ties into an email.

218
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recommend DDR drunk.

219
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:47,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it can be fun.

220
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:48,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Until you hit your head.

221
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:49,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Responsibly.

222
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:58,304
[SPEAKER_09]: We had an email on the show last week that kind of got me thinking about all this, was the whole, like, my friend says I'm not a gamer because I don't play X, Y, and Z. Remember that?

223
00:11:58,444 --> 00:11:59,585
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

224
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,521
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of not because it's been a busy week for me.

225
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:32,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I had school and I had my visit to the mikveh on Thursday.

226
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:33,888
[SPEAKER_05]: My conversion went through.

227
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I am now the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio.

228
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:38,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Congrats!

229
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:43,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Although SSJ100Matt is probably very upset about his title being stripped and his tiara.

230
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the host.

231
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:51,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you guys can also be the official co-Jews.

232
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:54,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they can be your... It says Yarmulke being stripped.

233
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,111
[SPEAKER_09]: They can be your harem of Jews.

234
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: They can be my posse.

235
00:12:59,012 --> 00:12:59,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, your posse.

236
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, any, anyway, uh, my, my Chavra, that's it.

237
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:09,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um, so yeah, that happened, and it was really great, and then I had to go talk in front of people on Friday.

238
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:27,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I, I played some Star Trek Online, and I had to go because Dan came home, and it was, I don't know, I just, I, I played a little bit, not a lot, just some, and so, oh, oh, oh, oh, my anniversary was on, um,

239
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday, my fifth anniversary.

240
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dan got me this instead of a rose.

241
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:34,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Sims 3 Ambitions.

242
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:36,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And isn't that much better than a rose?

243
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:41,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he also wrote me a note that said, in fact, here it is.

244
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put it up on the thing.

245
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on my Facebook right now.

246
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I didn't get you a rose.

247
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you would like this more.

248
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:47,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.

249
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,785
[SPEAKER_09]: D. Aww.

250
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take a picture and put it on the thing.

251
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:52,007
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sweet.

252
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,849
[SPEAKER_09]: You should gush about him while he's not here to defend himself.

253
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,171
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really cute.

254
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,373
[SPEAKER_09]: He has to be a manly man when he's here on the show.

255
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish Dan would stop believing his underwear in the hall.

256
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's move on to Loki.

257
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,208
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

258
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,292
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was pretty slim.

259
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:16,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned.

260
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still fun.

261
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:22,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played a few other things.

262
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,097
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

263
00:14:52,805 --> 00:15:17,149
[SPEAKER_07]: so there's a few games on there that haven't really been leaked out for JTAG users and that kind of stuff so I got to play a few different Xbox Live Arcade games that aren't out yet um that are actually kind of cool so one of them that I played was um Bonk apparently they're remaking Bonk um from Bonk's Adventure the old TurboGrafx game and um

264
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

265
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:24,900
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of done along the lines of how they did the Hudson Adventure Island remake.

266
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:34,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, but the one thing that they kind of took out of it that really made Bonk Bonk is his giant head.

267
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:40,080
[SPEAKER_07]: His head is now a little bit more proportioned to his body, which really sucks.

268
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it has the same type of, like when you're climbing a wall before in Bonk's Adventure, he used to use his teeth.

269
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:52,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in this, he's still biting the wall, but he also looks like he's climbing, so it doesn't make any sense why he's biting the wall.

270
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:55,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember a New Adventure Island game.

271
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:56,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that on the Wii or something?

272
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:57,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on the Wii.

273
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

274
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was a WiiWare game.

275
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:01,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

276
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't very good.

277
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:03,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

278
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:04,476
[SPEAKER_07]: That's too bad.

279
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one's kind of just okay, but I don't know.

280
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it might be pretty fun.

281
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:13,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play a whole lot of it, just a few levels, but...

282
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:14,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

283
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wish they'd left this head.

284
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,447
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really have to change too much.

285
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:25,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Just clean up the sprites a little bit and go from there.

286
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,413
[SPEAKER_09]: The last Adventure Island game I remember playing that I just absolutely loved was Super Adventure Island on the Super Nintendo.

287
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:33,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys ever played this game.

288
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:39,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the reasons I really loved that game was the soundtrack to that game was amazing.

289
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:40,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Actraiser

290
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

291
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,147
[SPEAKER_07]: The version that they have on PartnerNet is broken.

292
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:25,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't go past the main menu because you can move the cursor around on the menu, but no button that you press will actually allow you to start the game, which kind of sucked because I wanted to play that.

293
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else did I play?

294
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:28,576
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one other game I played.

295
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:34,460
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a dancing game that's coming out.

296
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, yeah, Dance It's Your Stage, which we'll be talking about coming out next week.

297
00:17:41,364 --> 00:18:04,274
[SPEAKER_07]: um, it's terrible, it's really, really bad, and I don't know, I'm not too familiar with the game itself, but I think, based off the music that I saw in there, and that guy looks like a total douche, um, I believe it's, um, it says it's a port of a German Wii game, I think it's based off of a

298
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's based off of a TV show.

299
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,097
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so strange that they're bringing it here then.

300
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:14,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it have David Hasselhoff in it then that you can dance to?

301
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:20,421
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but the music though in it is just not good.

302
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really the only thing that kind of sucks.

303
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:26,584
[SPEAKER_07]: The gameplay itself isn't very good either because it's got two kind of...

304
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:29,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

305
00:18:45,509 --> 00:19:08,354
[SPEAKER_07]: and it gets really confusing when it's you know going really fast and then also the music's very very very very terrible so um I really don't recommend picking it up not that many people probably would have next week anyways but it is a terrible game very very very terrible game um is it bad?

306
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:14,055
[SPEAKER_07]: it's very bad I wasn't sure it's terabad it's terabad terabad um

307
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:17,224
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did I play?

308
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:19,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, one other.

309
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:23,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a cave shooter game, and I'm going to butcher the name.

310
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:27,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was called Grungy or something like that.

311
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:28,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

312
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,052
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just from memory there.

313
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:33,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's your typical cave shooter games.

314
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:33,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it...

315
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

316
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:37,056
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

317
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that it for Game of the Week?

318
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:00,352
[SPEAKER_09]: That is it.

319
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:06,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be looking forward to your sneak peeks every week now of new stuff coming out until you get shut down.

320
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:12,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, until the console gets banned off partner net.

321
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:24,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually when they would ban the consoles, it's actually worse than if you got banned off live because when they ban your console, they blow all the e-fuses and it makes your console very...

322
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:26,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Broken.

323
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:27,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

324
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:28,216
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of evil.

325
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:34,803
[SPEAKER_07]: But the person that sold me the console took out the resistor that allows those e-fuses to be blown.

326
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:40,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they ban me from PartnerNet, the console will be just fine.

327
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:44,011
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like Mission Impossible, where it's like, this message will self-destruct in 30 seconds.

328
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but here's the thing.

329
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:45,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

330
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:54,842
[SPEAKER_07]: If I got banned from PartnerNet, I probably wouldn't care because here I thought there was going to be actual beta tests of games and stuff like that.

331
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:55,843
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the case.

332
00:20:55,883 --> 00:21:02,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could definitely see why they don't do that because people would be leaking that crap left and right.

333
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:08,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And even still with some of the arcade games, people leak them out there and that's got to suck for them.

334
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:08,256
[SPEAKER_07]: But

335
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,249
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

336
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:52,477
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start off tonight the marathon with a comment from Spazinator who is talking about the soundtracks because I was talking about Yuzo Koshiro a little bit ago says in my opinion the OSTs for Killer Instinct, Actraiser, Super Castlevania 4 and Mr. Bones have the best music.

337
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all some really good soundtracks although I don't know Mr. Bones.

338
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:56,640
[SPEAKER_09]: What system was that on?

339
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

340
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:13,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool, cool.

341
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:19,580
[SPEAKER_03]: The Killer Cuts CD that you got when you pre-ordered Killer Instinct on SNES was amazing.

342
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

343
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Hours and hours played in high school.

344
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:24,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't necessarily a pre-order either.

345
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:28,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I just went into Montgomery Wars back in the day and bought mine and I said, where's my CD?

346
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:31,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

347
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:41,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say one of my favorites was not actually from the game at all, but was the soundtrack to the Mortal Kombat motion picture because that CD was awesome.

348
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:44,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Mortal Kombat, test your mind.

349
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:45,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that song somewhere I'll have to play it on break.

350
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:46,417
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

351
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:48,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's move on to My Gaming Week.

352
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:49,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk quickly about this.

353
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:52,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, was that the Mortal Kombat game soundtrack?

354
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,422
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the actual movie soundtrack was awesome.

355
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:57,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the movie soundtrack was awesome, but remember the one that they did for the game?

356
00:22:58,105 --> 00:22:58,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Less awesome.

357
00:22:59,206 --> 00:22:59,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.

358
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:01,307
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very awesome.

359
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:02,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so awesome.

360
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to play Keyzer, that soundtrack.

361
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And Spazinator is clarifying in chat that Mr. Bones was a Sega Saturn game.

362
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:09,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

363
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:15,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about the Ghosts and Goblins kind of game that was on.

364
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:18,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

365
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:19,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

366
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,836
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a lot of other comments and chats here.

367
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:24,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was going to add one more thing to my gaming week.

368
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really my gaming week yet, but it will be.

369
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:37,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you haven't read my Twitter, I will be getting an iPod Touch.

370
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know what you're thinking.

371
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,350
[SPEAKER_07]: This goes against my total hatred of Macs.

372
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:42,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrong.

373
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:43,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And really Apple in general.

374
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:50,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've kind of gotten blinded by the whole hating Macs because iPods are not Macs.

375
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,300
[SPEAKER_07]: iPods are their own thing.

376
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, rationalize it however you can, Loki.

377
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,942
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Backpedal Express.

378
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:04,125
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, I didn't pay for this with my own money.

379
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:05,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what it really is.

380
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:09,587
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's being given them, how can he say no?

381
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:11,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they are still great MP3 players and stuff.

382
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,692
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think they're decent MP3s.

383
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:18,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't really give a crap about playing MP3s, but... Oh, they're game systems now, too.

384
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:18,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

385
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:19,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

386
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:27,928
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, if they gave me the gift card and said you have to spend it on a Mac computer, I think I'd have issues.

387
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,591
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm fine with the new iPod.

388
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:31,752
[SPEAKER_09]: FarFantasy10 Soundtrack for the Win

389
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:54,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment says the music from Brutal Legend was awesome.

390
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:57,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad they never released a formal original soundtrack for that game.

391
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:02,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Cyber Beast, I love this, chimes in with Daytona.

392
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:07,491
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what game actually had one of the little side soundtracks that they did?

393
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,812
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon.

394
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:14,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were both gorgeous arrangements of the music.

395
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Was Prey the one that was all piano?

396
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:17,317
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the ladies singing.

397
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:19,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

398
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a third.

399
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:26,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a lot that was on piano, but Celtic Moon was all the, you know, Celtic style.

400
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:26,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right.

401
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:27,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

402
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:27,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

403
00:25:28,264 --> 00:25:28,564
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

404
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:29,925
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

405
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be keeping an eye on chat throughout the night.

406
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com.

407
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:36,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazatsuma says, Loki, your soul is mine.

408
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:37,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Love, Steve Jobs.

409
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,590
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

410
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:41,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to spend the gift card on something.

411
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:44,634
[SPEAKER_07]: It was either that or, like, a bunch of the nanos.

412
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:48,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And what the hell would I do with a bunch of nanos or a bunch of the shuffles or whatever?

413
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:49,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

414
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,561
[SPEAKER_09]: But what a lot of companies do sometimes is that if they're buying these cards in bulk, then there's a discount on them.

415
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:30,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if a company buys $55 Starbucks cards to give away as an incentive, they might reduce the cost of that.

416
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:32,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So that way they have no cash value.

417
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:33,884
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not really gift cards.

418
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:34,924
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like coupons.

419
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then you can't do that.

420
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:40,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So it really depends if someone paid full cash value up front or not.

421
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Zeebo wants to know how you got the gift card.

422
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:45,246
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do?

423
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:45,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a present?

424
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:47,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you can talk about it.

425
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:48,727
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can talk about it.

426
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:50,488
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really anything I did.

427
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually what our video reps did.

428
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:59,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Our video reps do sales incentives with Sony for various titles throughout the year.

429
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:01,932
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten a bunch of things from Sony.

430
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:06,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, they do include us game reps even though we have nothing to do with this.

431
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,154
[SPEAKER_07]: in on the, you know, little spiffs.

432
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:20,498
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, for example, we've gotten a Sony HDTV, we've gotten a surround sound system, a camcorder, and they got a PlayStation 3.

433
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't included in that, but don't care, I already have one.

434
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:29,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to be getting, probably later on this year, a Sony-style card for $500.

435
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:32,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So they actually gave us a $500 card for Apple.

436
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:36,946
[SPEAKER_07]: T-ara suggested that you could buy a bunch of shuffles and throw them like ninja stars.

437
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:53,743
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I decided, because I'm nice and a wonderful husband and stuff, I bought myself an iPod.

438
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:56,804
[SPEAKER_07]: The new iPod Touch 8 gig.

439
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:58,705
[SPEAKER_07]: One for myself and one for my wife.

440
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,306
[SPEAKER_07]: To which she's like, what am I going to do with that?

441
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:04,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, God, I should have just spent it... Put Bejeweled on it for her.

442
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going... She doesn't care.

443
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:08,189
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, I can play Bejeweled online.

444
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:11,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, well, you can browse the internet with that.

445
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:15,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, can I just browse the internet anywhere or do I have to be on Wi-Fi?

446
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you have to be on Wi-Fi.

447
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:17,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's stupid.

448
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:18,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just use my computer here.

449
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Apple make diapers?

450
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we could use those right now.

451
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:27,261
[SPEAKER_07]: You should sell it and get the money so we can put it in our savings account.

452
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,782
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always the answer for stuff.

453
00:28:29,202 --> 00:28:33,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, the next time when we get that Sony-style card, she isn't getting shit.

454
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all mine.

455
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, though, I don't know what the hell I'd get from Sony-style for $500.

456
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelly sounds like my mother.

457
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:43,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just her Jewiness, I guess.

458
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:45,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, wait.

459
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:48,056
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura can officially be offended by that now.

460
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care, I don't care

461
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,451
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let me talk about my gaming week.

462
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:16,293
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week, I actually didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

463
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the same old, same old.

464
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I will talk about one new thing I played.

465
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:21,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to get a sneak peek at something just like Loki did.

466
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:27,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to play World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the beta for that, at least for a little bit.

467
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:31,144
[SPEAKER_09]: It worked for like a morning and then I couldn't get in all day yesterday.

468
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:33,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So Alan watched me play this too.

469
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,066
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool.

470
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:35,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I rolled a Worgen.

471
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:37,407
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

472
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,833
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

473
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,382
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

474
00:30:42,754 --> 00:31:10,308
[SPEAKER_09]: and when you collect the barrels then you have to walk up to the giant fat abomination creatures and you put the barrel on its head and then your character will yell fire and then the camera zooms back in a seamless motion and it goes back up to where you started the quest and there's a guy there with a gun and it shows him aiming it at the barrel and pulling the trigger and you watch the bullet fly with the camera and it hits the bullet and the abomination is saying something like uh oh me worried

475
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:16,550
[SPEAKER_09]: and then the bullet hits the barrel which is filled with gunpowder and the dude explodes and chunks go everywhere.

476
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

477
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:18,791
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like fun.

478
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:19,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It's getting hardcore.

479
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm liking this stuff.

480
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:33,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play the Goblin area yet but apparently they have a highway through the Goblin town and there's all these car racing Mario Kart type quests so they're getting crazy with all the different quests they have in the game.

481
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:36,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it called Grand Theft Azura.

482
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:36,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

483
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:38,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of all the little cars.

484
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:39,119
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

485
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,521
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

486
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:45,383
[SPEAKER_09]: The crack is saying your name, DarkSakura.

487
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I was just thinking that something that would be fun is if I play Sims all throughout the show and have a house built by the end of the show.

488
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,388
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want.

489
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:54,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Or start it at 5.

490
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll log into Star Trek Online.

491
00:31:57,492 --> 00:31:58,673
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wouldn't do that.

492
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:02,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, guys, I don't know what we're going to do once the regular show is over.

493
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:04,597
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to fill seven hours of radio somehow.

494
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:05,758
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure out how we get there.

495
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:06,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Worgan, Thumbs Up for Me

496
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:29,897
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

497
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:51,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of janky, did the Final Fantasy XI, or not XI, might as well be XI because it sucks.

498
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:56,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, did the Final Fantasy XIV beta, the open beta start this week?

499
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:56,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

500
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:59,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of, but a lot of people are having problems getting in.

501
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:04,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you have to actually register for the open beta, and they're only letting so many people in at a time.

502
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then that's a closed beta.

503
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupid.

504
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing they're having a lot of problems.

505
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:11,361
[SPEAKER_07]: See, they're limiting the amount of people that can play the beta.

506
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,822
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the time, yeah.

507
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:13,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

508
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:14,463
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

509
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:14,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

510
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that game's in a lot of trouble.

511
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:38,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm worried.

512
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:43,548
[SPEAKER_09]: They really, if they're smart, they're going to push back the release of that game and not try to release it.

513
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:44,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But it might be too late now.

514
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:45,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

515
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:50,412
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, speaking of release dates, playing this World of Warcraft beta got me thinking.

516
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's coming out this year.

517
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:56,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I know Blizzard has swore up and down that they're going to try and get it out this year.

518
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:01,338
[SPEAKER_09]: If they make this year, mid-December is like the earliest you're going to see this game.

519
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:02,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be out before Christmas.

520
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:02,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

521
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be mid-December then.

522
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,244
[SPEAKER_09]: When you say before Christmas, you mean like two weeks before Christmas.

523
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:14,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Before Christmas, because they've already sent out a map notice saying that their map stuff's ending on the 25th.

524
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:14,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

525
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:17,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like there's a lot left still.

526
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:21,238
[SPEAKER_09]: of the beta process.

527
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:28,340
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really matter that they sent out that notice, but I'm just saying that right now, that's what they're saying is that it's going to be out before Christmas.

528
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're probably waiting to announce the actual release date at BlizzCon, but I'm thinking mid-December because there's still all this stuff they've got to do.

529
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:40,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to do the actual patch for Cataclysm, which will probably be about three weeks before the game releases.

530
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:45,485
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to do the world event that leads up to the Cataclysm, which is another three weeks.

531
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:51,128
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to do one more patch still of the taking of Gnomeregan and Echo Islands.

532
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:52,329
[SPEAKER_09]: That still has to happen too.

533
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's still a good 10 weeks of plot content that has to happen before the game can come out.

534
00:34:58,573 --> 00:34:59,974
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's only so much time left.

535
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:00,654
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

536
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:01,695
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

537
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:04,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to our guests and their gaming weeks.

538
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, how was your gaming week?

539
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:09,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty boring.

540
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Same old, same old.

541
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe an hour or two of Zuma's Revenge.

542
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:13,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Revisited that.

543
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:13,783
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of fun.

544
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:14,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just a lot of WoW.

545
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:16,806
[SPEAKER_03]: No real developments there.

546
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:18,287
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your big WoW accomplishments lately?

547
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:26,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I got enough rep with the oracles to buy their stupid egg that hatches once a week to try and get the mount from it.

548
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

549
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:29,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

550
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:29,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Very boring.

551
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:30,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

552
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:30,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

553
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:31,582
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

554
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:39,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other games that you like to play regularly outside of WoW just so the listeners don't think you play WoW all time all the day, although that may be what you actually do?

555
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:42,878
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really it.

556
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:45,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

557
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest 2, I've talked about that before.

558
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:49,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Zuma's Revenge, like I just said.

559
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Peggle on your phone, your new iPhone 4 that we got last week.

560
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:54,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Peggle is crack.

561
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:56,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Peggle's really awesome.

562
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:58,381
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

563
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:02,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of our listeners are saying the stream is skipping.

564
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:08,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what's going on, but with a 12-hour show, I'm sure it's going to be a problem through a lot of it.

565
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,829
[SPEAKER_09]: But just a reminder to everybody in studio, whatever bandwidth, you got to make sure.

566
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I did forget to close my torrent, so I just closed it.

567
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-ohs.

568
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:15,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there you go.

569
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,112
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, maybe that'll help.

570
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:17,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

571
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,094
[SPEAKER_09]: If it still is skipping in about 10 minutes, I'll try rebooting the stream.

572
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: But meanwhile...

573
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:28,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I kind of asked Bradley about his game of the week and he said he was doing mostly traveling, but I'll ask again if there's anything you want to throw out there, Bradley.

574
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:34,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there was no games this week, but I want to go with my last week because I was playing a bunch of games then.

575
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Shadow Complex.

576
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,691
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun game.

577
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:41,134
[SPEAKER_01]: That was for last year's Summer Arcade.

578
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:43,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually bought all the ones for this year.

579
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:43,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

580
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Just mainly because I bought the four of them, so I bought Monday Night Combat as well.

581
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:58,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I played through the demo, and it's a game I probably might play a little bit, but it's not one I'd play a lot because it's one of those team-based combat games I'm not big on.

582
00:36:58,742 --> 00:37:03,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Castlevania HD, I didn't play that last week, but I played through the game on that, and that's fun.

583
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:08,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of one thing, as you said on one of the previous podcasts, was that...

584
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,127
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

585
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:27,787
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

586
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:50,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you do that one.

587
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:55,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what the other games... Limbo, that one's actually a pretty cool game.

588
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,116
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's worth a play.

589
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:07,499
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a bit expensive for the $15 just because if the first playthrough of it, it only took me about three and a half hours, and if...

590
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:08,239
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

591
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:36,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

592
00:38:58,264 --> 00:38:59,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light?

593
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:00,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did play that.

594
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:02,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I played through the first four levels and that was pretty fun.

595
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:07,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played the co-op because I haven't had a second person there to play it.

596
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:09,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds interesting from what you said last week.

597
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two weeks ago, I think.

598
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:14,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was definitely a fanboy for that game, I'm not even going to lie.

599
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,123
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of one of those surprises.

600
00:39:17,263 --> 00:39:19,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.

601
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:21,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wasn't, so it was cool.

602
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:23,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the arcade feel of that game a lot.

603
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like playing Gauntlet, kind of.

604
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I also played Burnout Revenge.

605
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:34,578
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been like a year, almost nine or eight, ten months since I played it last, but I like the Burnout games as they're...

606
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:40,060
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like arcade racing simulators, but arcade racing.

607
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fun knocking people off the road and trying to get the thing.

608
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:49,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the burning laps and preview races where you have to beat a certain time are really annoying.

609
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:54,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you die, if you mess up one time, you have to restart the whole race and start over and over.

610
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:58,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes like an hour to get a gold on it or a perfect rating on it.

611
00:39:59,125 --> 00:39:59,405
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

612
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess that's going to do it for everybody's gaming weeks.

613
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,350
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you all right over there?

614
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:05,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Crash?

615
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:07,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I just knocked my fork over.

616
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Party foul.

617
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:11,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my delicious food, which I'm not going to describe.

618
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:12,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still very garlicky.

619
00:40:13,017 --> 00:40:13,317
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

620
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:14,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing wrong with garlic.

621
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:18,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move into some gaming news after we do some housekeeping tonight.

622
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:23,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a whole lot to add other than we already talked about we're going to be going a long, long, long show tonight.

623
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:26,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if the skipping problem is resolved.

624
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like some people are saying, yeah, it's better.

625
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Some are saying it's still going, so we'll see.

626
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:31,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll give it a few more minutes to work itself out.

627
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:40,101
[SPEAKER_09]: and otherwise I guess I'll say add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

628
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:45,223
[SPEAKER_09]: If you follow us on there, we can give you updates so that you know if we're going to be doing a show early or whatever's going on.

629
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:47,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some news.

630
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:50,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's finally start talking some actual gaming news here today.

631
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:54,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Big news out of Penny Arcade Expo, right Loki?

632
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, this is kind of like...

633
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:03,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Very surprising news, but I'm sure people are taking it with a grain of salt.

634
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:10,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Duke Nukem Forever is coming out 2011 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

635
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:16,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It is now being developed by Gearbox Software with the help of 2K Games.

636
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:45,785
[SPEAKER_07]: and they are finishing what 3D Realms took over 10 years to start I guess and it was playable on the show floor and it's everything Duke Nukem should be you know with being able to pee everywhere and you know blowjob into windows and you know strippers are there strippers strippers punting eyeballs across you know a football field

637
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:47,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Good stuff.

638
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:48,640
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

639
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's where I want to start.

640
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:55,204
[SPEAKER_09]: This is obviously, yay, funny gaming news.

641
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:57,065
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like, hooray, it's finally happening.

642
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:59,806
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, there's a part of me that goes, okay, well, look.

643
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:04,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is really the same game that Duke Nukem Forever was originally going to be.

644
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:10,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, that might be kind of a duh because it's probably been like five different games over the past 13 years.

645
00:42:10,392 --> 00:42:11,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure more than that, yeah.

646
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:22,706
[SPEAKER_09]: But I honestly think after the closure of 3D Realms, I think these guys probably got the IP and probably nuked everything that had happened before.

647
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:27,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know they say that they've taken what 3D Realms started or whatever, but I go...

648
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:29,153
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Duke Nukem

649
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:53,951
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a game where we cannot make a promise we cannot fulfill.

650
00:42:55,091 --> 00:43:02,214
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get past the shock and awe and then we can go to all the retailers and first parties and work with our launch plan.

651
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:04,815
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be coming out though.

652
00:43:06,776 --> 00:43:30,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited, I love the Duke Nukem games and to be honest, just from the screenshots and the little cam videos that they had of the gameplay it looks good, it looks like, you know, because I think they're really going to kind of keep the vibe of the old games in there and it's just going to be souped up now and Gearbox, you know, they've definitely got a good pedigree as far as first person shooters go so I'm pretty confident that they'll churn out a good game

653
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:33,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

654
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiplayer.

655
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,311
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not really showing a lot of that.

656
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,174
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be good multiplayer though if Gearbox is involved.

657
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:40,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they do map editing and all that stuff.

658
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:41,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so too.

659
00:43:41,637 --> 00:43:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

660
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:48,384
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the most fun part of the original Duke Nukem was looking at all those custom maps that would come out for that.

661
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the PC version, but I don't know about the 360 and PS3.

662
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Parish the thought.

663
00:43:52,145 --> 00:43:53,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that.

664
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:55,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's a topic near and dear to your heart, Alan, right?

665
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:15,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Quaking with rage right now.

666
00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:15,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

667
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:21,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Once Portal 2 is out, their next press release better have Half-Life in it.

668
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll see.

669
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:26,243
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on to another topic.

670
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:32,806
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll know more about that game, I guess, closer to when it actually releases, which it sounds like is actually going to happen at some point.

671
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:33,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

672
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:37,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Talking about another thing that's floating around out there.

673
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:40,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if they're showing this at PAX, but I guess the news broke.

674
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually heard about it thanks to the GameStop Managers Conference.

675
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:46,313
[SPEAKER_09]: They were showing this, which was the week before PAX.

676
00:44:47,253 --> 00:44:55,956
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think a lot of the stuff that is at PAX now was probably at this conference like the week before but this was one of them and it has to do with the new Xbox 360 controller.

677
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:59,097
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a redesign of the Xbox 360 wireless controller.

678
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:00,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It's now going to be silver.

679
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:07,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of has this black, white, silver look to it with only the green being in the lights for the Xbox logo.

680
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,740
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really the only place they are.

681
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:13,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, the other big change to this, a new D-pad.

682
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:16,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

683
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:19,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, in America, they are fixing the D-pad.

684
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,206
[SPEAKER_09]: But not only are they fixing it, it's really different.

685
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,647
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're doing, it's a transforming D-pad.

686
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:35,192
[SPEAKER_09]: What you can do, you can pop out the plus sign to have it just be the plus sign, or you can actually have a whole little like kind of...

687
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:37,093
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

688
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I already know the answer to that, so I can't say.

689
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:06,581
45.

690
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:08,881
[SPEAKER_09]: 45 says... About-ish.

691
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:09,721
[SPEAKER_09]: About-ish.

692
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:10,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

693
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:12,862
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $64.99 for this new controller.

694
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:13,502
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why?

695
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,843
[SPEAKER_09]: They're only selling it with the Play and Charge kit as a bundle.

696
00:46:18,963 --> 00:46:20,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a limited edition.

697
00:46:20,884 --> 00:46:26,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a part of me that kind of goes, like, looks at that and goes, you little shits.

698
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:30,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know your controller is a problem.

699
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:33,170
[SPEAKER_09]: You've known this for a long time.

700
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:39,855
[SPEAKER_09]: You've fixed it with limited releases, like some sort of tease, like time again in Europe.

701
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:48,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that you're finally releasing something kind of a step beyond that here, you're going to gouge for it when it's like a problem in the first place?

702
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you suck.

703
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:52,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a dick, whoever thought of this.

704
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:53,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

705
00:46:55,222 --> 00:47:02,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the look to the controller though, even though it is a little weird that the buttons are not that yellow, blue, red, green.

706
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:09,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's going to be wonderful for, I don't know, players that are new and that they have color, you know, little...

707
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Indicators and stuff on the screen that correspond to those buttons.

708
00:47:15,445 --> 00:47:20,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the buttons don't have colors because they're black and white.

709
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:21,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did they do that?

710
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:22,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just dumb.

711
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:29,374
[SPEAKER_07]: The only way I would see that being acceptable is if they were backlit with those actual colors.

712
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:34,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks gray when it's turned off, but actually has colors shining through when you turn it on.

713
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:36,379
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not the case with this.

714
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just them being dumb.

715
00:47:40,453 --> 00:47:44,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, I'm sure the only thing limited is the bundle and color.

716
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:46,397
[SPEAKER_09]: They will continue with the new D-pad.

717
00:47:46,918 --> 00:47:47,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

718
00:47:47,538 --> 00:47:48,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're right on that.

719
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:49,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

720
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:50,820
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't really said on that, though.

721
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this is a trial thing?

722
00:47:53,422 --> 00:47:56,004
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a trick to get you to buy it right now for $65.

723
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:58,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

724
00:47:59,146 --> 00:48:01,388
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to get you suckers on an impulse buy.

725
00:48:01,408 --> 00:48:02,008
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.

726
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:03,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

727
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:03,929
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

728
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

729
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,111
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

730
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:23,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in the realm of PlayStation, they were sending out a survey seeing if people would be interested in having a digital comic service on the PS3 and not just on the PSP.

731
00:48:24,658 --> 00:48:48,805
[SPEAKER_05]: and um so I'm not sure if they're actually going to do that now but I mean it would be kind of neat being able to read my comics on the TV although honestly I can just look at my digital comics on my computer and we have a computer hooked up to our TV in the front room so big diff um I think nothing's really going to replace you know actually having paper in your hand and reading the comic and going ooh pretty you know

732
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:52,546
[SPEAKER_09]: But for those that want it, it's available.

733
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:53,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good for them.

734
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:57,427
[SPEAKER_05]: If Sony wants to do it, good for them.

735
00:48:57,487 --> 00:48:58,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll get something out of it.

736
00:48:59,508 --> 00:49:02,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that it's going to be worth the expenditure.

737
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:05,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read comics on my iPhone.

738
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:07,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Having it handheld, that's one thing.

739
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are a little more portable.

740
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,111
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to take a book that you'd worry about ruining.

741
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:15,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm at work right now and I want to read a comic.

742
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not at work and want to read a comic.

743
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on my lunch.

744
00:49:20,781 --> 00:49:22,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm on my lunch break and want to read a comic.

745
00:49:22,582 --> 00:49:24,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I have my break sign up all day.

746
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:31,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised you haven't brought this up in your comic podcast yet.

747
00:49:32,064 --> 00:49:35,445
[SPEAKER_09]: You taped a comic podcast this morning, right?

748
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:38,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but we focus more on the comics themselves.

749
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:38,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

750
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:40,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And where can they download that?

751
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:43,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let you work in a cheap plug for your new old spinoff show.

752
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:47,058
[SPEAKER_05]: InfamousGamers.net is the site.

753
00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:49,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no I, there's just an N. Infamous.

754
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:51,084
[SPEAKER_05]: The letter N. Nice.

755
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's actually just Infamous.net, yeah.

756
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be InfamousGamers.com.

757
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:04,883
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the meantime, though, you also can find easier links right now on our various Twitters and whatnot.

758
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:05,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

759
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:07,504
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

760
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:08,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck with that, by the way.

761
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're totally a sucker for having done that already this morning.

762
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:15,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've already been broadcasting for an hour or two, right?

763
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:16,228
[SPEAKER_05]: We were Skype-casting.

764
00:50:16,528 --> 00:50:17,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Skype-casting?

765
00:50:17,488 --> 00:50:17,868
[SPEAKER_09]: That works.

766
00:50:17,888 --> 00:50:19,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we do it, is Skype.

767
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:19,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype.

768
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:20,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And when do your new episodes come out?

769
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:23,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And every so often we get Dalek voice.

770
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:25,192
[SPEAKER_09]: You tape today, but it'll come out what, tomorrow?

771
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:25,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow.

772
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:26,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, very cool.

773
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:29,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got, after we're done here, I've got editing to do.

774
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:30,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun!

775
00:50:30,554 --> 00:50:31,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck with that.

776
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:32,595
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

777
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:35,616
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on to more stories, Loki.

778
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:39,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's kind of funny.

779
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:49,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Medal of Honor, a big game that's going to be coming out from EA this October, is actually banned from military bases.

780
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:54,530
[SPEAKER_07]: At least GameStop's located in military bases.

781
00:50:55,211 --> 00:51:03,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, this is a decision, I guess, by GameStop and also with, I believe...

782
00:51:05,737 --> 00:51:15,001
[SPEAKER_07]: They said the PX Commanding General of the Army and Air Forces Exchange Services.

783
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:17,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I made the decision about that.

784
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:24,966
[SPEAKER_07]: So it says GameStop has agreed out of respect for our past and present men and women in uniform.

785
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:27,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not carry Medal of Honor in any of our...

786
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:29,289
[SPEAKER_07]: A.A.F.E.S.

787
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:38,896
[SPEAKER_07]: based stores at this time does not include our four stores on marine installations GameStop fully supports the A.A.F.E.S.

788
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:49,785
[SPEAKER_07]: in this endeavor and it is sensitive to the fact in multiplayer mode one side will assume the role of Taliban fighters

789
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:58,367
[SPEAKER_07]: As such, GameStop has agreed to have all marketing materials pulled by noon today and stop taking reservations.

790
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:07,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Customers who entered our AAFES stores and wish to reserve metal can and should be directed to the nearest GameStop location off base.

791
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:18,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we appreciate the sensitivity and know our AAFES based stores will continue to honor the great customer base in which they serve.

792
00:52:20,188 --> 00:52:24,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course that is because the Taliban are in multiplayer.

793
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:29,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, because our soldiers can go and fight in Iraq and stuff like that.

794
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:35,058
[SPEAKER_07]: But oh my god, the Taliban's in a video game and then we're going to flip out because they can't handle that.

795
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:36,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dumb.

796
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,263
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just like saying we should remove all the Germans out of Call of Duty because, you know...

797
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:45,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

798
00:52:45,132 --> 00:52:47,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I would find it a little weird in the first place.

799
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:49,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not weird, but I would...

800
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:03,770
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

801
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:23,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you want to play Mario Kart or something?

802
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:51,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Oil.

803
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:15,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, I understand it's oil as well, but, I mean, there's still the fighting for freedom kind of crap because, you know, you're trying to save everybody from the terrorists.

804
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:19,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just, I don't understand what the big deal is.

805
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:30,004
[SPEAKER_09]: What's also interesting is that they're really not the first, you know, country, U.S., to take issue with this because I think we had a story on the show last week, right, about the British had a problem with this game too.

806
00:54:30,584 --> 00:54:34,326
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're talking about banning it, I think, in Britain completely.

807
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:34,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

808
00:54:35,026 --> 00:54:35,767
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop GameStop GameStop

809
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:55,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment in our chatroom kind of reiterates a point here.

810
00:54:56,068 --> 00:55:00,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We also support the ability of people in the military to go off base and buy the game.

811
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, go off base and buy the game.

812
00:55:03,352 --> 00:55:07,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's not like the game is banned altogether.

813
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:12,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that would kind of be against the Constitution, but, you know, they don't have to support it, I suppose.

814
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:13,717
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

815
00:55:14,918 --> 00:55:21,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just something that they did because they think it's, you know, out of respect to those who serve, we will not be stocking this game.

816
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:27,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And they apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.

817
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:30,051
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, they're like, well, just go off base and buy it.

818
00:55:30,752 --> 00:55:33,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand what the big deal is then.

819
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:38,679
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were saying, oh, well, we don't want it on the base because that sets the wrong precedent.

820
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:41,681
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can buy it off base and bring it back in.

821
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:42,222
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

822
00:55:42,242 --> 00:55:42,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

823
00:55:43,499 --> 00:55:49,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's talk about something a little less serious than these types of games and talk about something a little more casual, shall we?

824
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:51,925
[SPEAKER_09]: This is also news that's coming out of Penny Arcade Expo.

825
00:55:52,645 --> 00:55:56,047
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a brand new crossover game from Telltale Games.

826
00:55:56,448 --> 00:55:59,570
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember there was a teaser that I believe we brought up on the show last week.

827
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:13,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see, if you could imagine, what would Homestar Runner, the guys from Penny Arcade, Sam and Max, and now Team Fortress 2 characters, what are they all going to do in a new game together?

828
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:14,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Blow shit up?

829
00:56:40,085 --> 00:56:43,306
[SPEAKER_09]: They are apparently showing off the game right now at PAX.

830
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:45,006
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got posters and all that good stuff.

831
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:47,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan Connors, the CEO of Telltale,

832
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:13,920
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like this game is going to have a lot of smack talking in it, which might be kind of cool, because Homestar Runner talking shit will actually be really funny, I think.

833
00:57:15,441 --> 00:57:17,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're a stupid poopy head.

834
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:21,204
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

835
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:27,527
[SPEAKER_09]: What I think is another thing to kind of draw out of that quote, we pitched the idea to friends in the industry.

836
00:57:28,347 --> 00:57:29,208
[SPEAKER_09]: So they got...

837
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:30,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Team Fortress 2

838
00:57:59,042 --> 00:57:59,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Seaman Seaman Seaman

839
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:26,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the chick from Mirror's Edge.

840
00:58:27,094 --> 00:58:29,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see EA and Steam have a close relationship.

841
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:37,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the unicorns from that stupid game on Steam.

842
00:58:37,425 --> 00:58:38,466
[SPEAKER_09]: The Pink Honest game?

843
00:58:38,867 --> 00:58:39,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

844
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:45,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you're talking PC, how about an orc and a night elf?

845
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:47,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady Gaga Lady Gaga

846
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people have too much time on their hands.

847
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:11,882
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually kind of good.

848
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it up there and you didn't even look.

849
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

850
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:15,823
[SPEAKER_09]: When did you put it up?

851
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:16,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday.

852
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:18,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've been busy the past couple days.

853
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:21,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I was busy sleeping yesterday, I'll have you know.

854
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You how?

855
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:24,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Two naps.

856
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:25,588
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this, Alan?

857
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:28,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob took two naps yesterday.

858
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:30,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Two two-hour naps.

859
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:31,710
[SPEAKER_03]: An old man.

860
00:59:32,371 --> 00:59:33,031
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very cute.

861
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:35,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up, don't judge me.

862
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:37,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jay Dizzle, perfect answer.

863
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:39,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Duke Nukem should be in the game.

864
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:39,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

865
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:42,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, it's going to be a big release coming up.

866
00:59:42,556 --> 00:59:43,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that answer.

867
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:44,297
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

868
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:47,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on and talk about more gaming news.

869
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:51,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Release date's coming up in just a moment, but first, DarkSakura has something for us.

870
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's not really so much of a story, so much as an impression.

871
00:59:54,742 --> 00:59:58,583
[SPEAKER_05]: The new screen caps for the Mortal Kombat game that's coming out are up.

872
00:59:59,524 --> 01:00:01,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks really fun.

873
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:02,807
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

874
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:23,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what the word is.

875
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:38,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking really at what I'm telling just from the images and it seems to me like there's this one scene in here with Katana, let me find her, where she's just covered in blood and it's fantastic.

876
01:00:38,754 --> 01:00:49,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And Melina has her horrible, ugly eat your face face and everything just looks like what Mortal Kombat used to be except for being 3D instead of

877
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:54,609
[SPEAKER_05]: being, you know, the motion cap.

878
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:14,178
[SPEAKER_09]: To be fair, I didn't play the DC Universe game, but I played pretty much all the others.

879
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:20,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoyed the first couple, what was it, Deception, and there was another one in there too.

880
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:23,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the last one they did with all the kids.

881
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:24,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Deadly Alliance.

882
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:25,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually a decent game.

883
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:26,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Deadly Alliance is awesome.

884
01:01:27,026 --> 01:01:28,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the little RPG thing in there.

885
01:01:28,827 --> 01:01:36,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, even those mini modes, some of them were kind of stupid, like in Deception they had the kart racing and stuff, which was definitely an afterthought, but I ate that shit up.

886
01:01:36,371 --> 01:01:37,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was awesome.

887
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

888
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:53,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

889
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be fantastic.

890
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:59,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I want there to be special stage fatalities for every stage.

891
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:00,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

892
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:01,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want more blood.

893
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:10,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like these new IP owners, Warner Brothers is taking care of this now after Midway, although a lot of the people that used to be involved are involved now.

894
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:15,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It really sounds like they're just like, okay, after that DC... They interviewed Ed Boon about it a few months ago.

895
01:02:16,077 --> 01:02:16,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

896
01:02:16,657 --> 01:02:20,378
[SPEAKER_09]: After that DC Universe game, let's just give the fans what they want.

897
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:21,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just go balls to the wall.

898
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:26,782
[SPEAKER_09]: We want a Street Fighter 4-esque type of upgrade.

899
01:02:26,902 --> 01:02:32,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Street Fighter 4 was a fucking awesome upgrade from old school Street Fighter.

900
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's what they're going to give us with this new Mortal Kombat game.

901
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:40,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at this red guy here and he's throwing the scorpion little chain thing.

902
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:42,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Ermac?

903
01:02:42,213 --> 01:02:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that the ninja from Deadly Alliance?

904
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:45,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever his name was.

905
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:46,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember his name.

906
01:02:46,158 --> 01:02:46,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

907
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,941
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's another thing that I wouldn't mind seeing.

908
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:49,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's Ermac.

909
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:53,006
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember Soul Calibur's create a fighter thing?

910
01:02:53,427 --> 01:02:56,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can create certain ones that have actually a story to it?

911
01:02:56,831 --> 01:02:57,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be...

912
01:02:59,468 --> 01:03:00,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Reptile, Spitting, Splashy, Acid Vomit

913
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:18,390
[SPEAKER_09]: They do a pretty good job on the Soul Calibur games, though.

914
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I will give you that.

915
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:25,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably my second favorite series of fighting games behind Mortal Kombat, and yes, even above Street Fighter, is Soul Calibur.

916
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:39,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Those games are really badass, and I'm really waiting for news on Soul Calibur V. I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, it's about time to hear about Soul Calibur V, because the Yoda and Darth Vader days have long passed, so I'd like to know what's up with that.

917
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,983
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, like, the robot dudes.

918
01:03:42,164 --> 01:03:42,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Cyrax.

919
01:03:43,164 --> 01:03:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that they've pulled a lot of the stuff that people liked from the other series.

920
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:48,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually got high hopes for this.

921
01:03:48,547 --> 01:03:48,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

922
01:03:49,088 --> 01:03:52,550
[SPEAKER_05]: For any of our friends, though, that are at PAX, I want to hear what you think about it.

923
01:03:52,890 --> 01:04:03,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm liking that it looks like a lot of the roster for Mortal Kombat 3, except they kind of, at least so far, looks like they've said Sia to a lot of the characters that just really weren't notable out of those games, like Striker.

924
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:05,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, who... I liked him.

925
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:06,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Who played Striker?

926
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:06,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, come on.

927
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:07,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play him, actually.

928
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:08,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, come on.

929
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:08,640
[SPEAKER_09]: He sucks.

930
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Because...

931
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,903
[SPEAKER_05]: If you knew how to use him right, he was really, really awesome.

932
01:04:13,903 --> 01:04:17,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had this one-punch combo that was super sweet.

933
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say I loved Cabal.

934
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:22,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Cabal.

935
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:28,114
[SPEAKER_09]: He was awesome, and I don't think he's really coming back because he wasn't really notable in the mythology.

936
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:28,995
[SPEAKER_05]: He had the run thing.

937
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:32,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was cheap, and I loved Sindel.

938
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Sindel.

939
01:04:33,258 --> 01:04:37,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Sindel was badass, but again, what was she really there to do?

940
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:41,303
[SPEAKER_09]: She was there to be the one dude's wife, and then she kind of disappears.

941
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:44,705
[SPEAKER_09]: She didn't really... Or no, she's Katana's mom, though, isn't she?

942
01:04:45,026 --> 01:04:47,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, and the other one was the Goro chick.

943
01:04:48,488 --> 01:04:50,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't care for her.

944
01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:50,910
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

945
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:51,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Shiva.

946
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:52,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiva, that was it.

947
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:53,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't care for her.

948
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, what a derivative name that is.

949
01:04:56,273 --> 01:04:58,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really like Sindel and her scream thing.

950
01:05:00,922 --> 01:05:03,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, like I said, it's not exactly a story.

951
01:05:03,503 --> 01:05:06,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anyone wants to see the images, just go to Eurogamer.net.

952
01:05:06,885 --> 01:05:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're really... I'm actually excited about a Mortal Kombat game.

953
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:15,948
[SPEAKER_09]: VidPower in our chatroom says, Striker is the Dan of the Mortal Kombat universe.

954
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you can win a game with Dan, you're pretty awesome, right?

955
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:38,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, I like that Derek H in our chatroom By the way, I neglected to say this last week on the show And I really need to give a big holler and thank you to Derek H for the big battle Which wrapped up last week Even though we got our butts kicked by the host country, Dead Picks Alive You know how that usually happens in the Olympics?

956
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:48,369
[SPEAKER_09]: The host country usually wins And Dead Picks Alive won We made a really good job second place So thank you to all the listeners who helped out in the big battle there And I just want to give kudos to Derek for putting that all together

957
01:05:48,909 --> 01:05:51,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I do the same thing with Cammy Cammy's actually a good character too

958
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:16,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Alan, just like his eyes got really big and he's looking like, I'm gonna cut this bitch.

959
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:16,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan hates Cammy.

960
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:17,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan hates Cammy.

961
01:06:17,732 --> 01:06:18,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan's yelling from the other room.

962
01:06:18,572 --> 01:06:20,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you like Cammy, right?

963
01:06:20,854 --> 01:06:22,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, she's amazing.

964
01:06:22,835 --> 01:06:29,840
[SPEAKER_05]: And my favorite thing that she does is the little mid-air combos where she spins and then goes into a different kick or a punch or something.

965
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they called?

966
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:31,902
[SPEAKER_05]: The hooligan combos, I think?

967
01:06:32,002 --> 01:06:33,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my thing with Cammy.

968
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:35,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I like her as a character.

969
01:06:35,845 --> 01:06:38,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know Kylie Minogue playing her in the movie was the best thing ever.

970
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:40,988
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only good thing about the movie.

971
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:46,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I like her as a character, but as a street fighter, God, I hate her.

972
01:06:47,353 --> 01:06:48,774
[SPEAKER_09]: She's so useless.

973
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:50,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, I take that back.

974
01:06:50,055 --> 01:06:52,196
[SPEAKER_09]: T-Hawk is probably the most useless street fighter.

975
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:54,238
[SPEAKER_07]: She just has a nice ass.

976
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:54,998
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

977
01:06:55,218 --> 01:06:56,539
[SPEAKER_07]: They drew her with a nice ass.

978
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,141
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really the only good thing.

979
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:00,382
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my thing.

980
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:04,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter how much someone says a character sucks.

981
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:06,747
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoy playing them and you're good at them...

982
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:09,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody else better watch out.

983
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:12,977
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the trash-talking roots of the gaming universe.

984
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:17,341
[SPEAKER_09]: What you believe to be true is law, and everybody else is stupid.

985
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:23,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody can agree that you'd probably look better naked than T-Hawk anyway.

986
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,310
[SPEAKER_05]: T-Hawk would be disproportionate if he actually didn't have clothes on.

987
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:27,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

988
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:29,840
[SPEAKER_05]: No penis.

989
01:07:33,323 --> 01:07:33,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

990
01:07:34,123 --> 01:07:37,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the whole point is, it's just like with video games.

991
01:07:38,146 --> 01:07:41,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Games are only as good as the system they're on.

992
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:43,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the system they're on.

993
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:46,052
[SPEAKER_05]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

994
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then a character is only as good as the player playing.

995
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:56,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Take my Kami bashing with a grain of salt because I love Fei Long.

996
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,314
[SPEAKER_09]: He's my favorite character in Street Fighter.

997
01:07:59,215 --> 01:08:00,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's badass.

998
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:05,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy playing Sakura, but that's just because she's fun because she does her little hop thing.

999
01:08:05,438 --> 01:08:05,679
[SPEAKER_03]: You?

1000
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:06,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing Sakura?

1001
01:08:06,579 --> 01:08:07,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Karin was really good.

1002
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Gambit and Cammy

1003
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:33,166
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Men vs. Street Fighter

1004
01:08:57,148 --> 01:08:59,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.

1005
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:03,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's starting to ramp up a little bit because we're getting into the long fourth quarter.

1006
01:09:05,414 --> 01:09:10,037
[SPEAKER_07]: So starting things off, Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii and DS this week.

1007
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:16,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

1008
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:26,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii version comes out later, if that's right.

1009
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:28,870
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1010
01:09:48,632 --> 01:10:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: NHL 11 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Midnight Mysteries, The Edgar Allan Poe Conspiracy on Nintendo DS Kingdom Hearts I will be buying that game Quoth the Raven, never more

1011

[SPEAKER_07]: Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep coming out on the PSP.

1012
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:08,781
[SPEAKER_07]: No PSP Go though.

1013
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:12,282
[SPEAKER_07]: NHL Slapshot.

1014
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:17,384
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the crappy Wii game with the hockey stick controller.

1015
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're not going to break a TV with that.

1016
01:10:20,985 --> 01:10:22,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Sports Champions!

1017
01:10:22,065 --> 01:10:22,666
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the fun part!

1018
01:10:22,906 --> 01:10:36,050
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're at your friend's house and he beats you in NHL, whatever, whatever, and he's like, yeah, ha, I beat you, you suck, ha ha, you can just start bashing the TV in with your controller saying, ha, well, I fucked up your TV, later, bitch.

1019
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:42,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Sports Champions, the Wii Sports type game for the PlayStation Move.

1020
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:45,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, this will make a nice coaster for the next two weeks.

1021
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:51,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Saints Row Double Pack, it's a re-release of the two Saints Row games on Xbox 360 for only $29.99.

1022
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:52,247
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a...

1023
01:10:58,314 --> 01:10:58,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1024
01:10:59,035 --> 01:11:03,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Brunswick Cosmic Bowling Game, which I'm sure is not terrible at all on the Wii.

1025
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:05,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Ruse.

1026
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:11,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the real-time strategy game that you can bluff in on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1027
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:15,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Aeon Assault on, uh, Valeria.

1028
01:11:16,048 --> 01:11:17,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like that's how you pronounce that.

1029
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably fucked that up.

1030
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:21,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that's on PC.

1031
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Start the Party.

1032
01:11:23,374 --> 01:11:26,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be a real party in your house when you're staring at this, uh,

1033
01:11:26,957 --> 01:11:31,642
[SPEAKER_07]: in this Blu-ray case, and that's on the PS3.

1034
01:11:32,143 --> 01:11:32,703
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

1035
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:34,805
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you start the party?

1036
01:11:35,746 --> 01:11:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Start the party by buying the party supplies in preparation for two weeks.

1037
01:11:40,091 --> 01:11:41,653
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this fucking game, Loki?

1038
01:11:41,733 --> 01:11:43,014
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

1039
01:11:43,254 --> 01:11:44,636
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, iToyPlay?

1040
01:11:45,577 --> 01:11:47,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Think of that, but now with the PlayStation Move controller.

1041
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:59,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Kung Fu Rider, a game so terrible it's actually probably more fun to stare at the case than actually play it.

1042
01:12:00,138 --> 01:12:03,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be coming out as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1043
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:09,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Photo World, it's a game where you take photos with a DSi camera.

1044
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:11,686
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, it's a DSi only game.

1045
01:12:11,926 --> 01:12:12,466
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1046
01:12:12,506 --> 01:12:15,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do stuff that I don't know, I can do without the game.

1047
01:12:15,648 --> 01:12:16,249
[SPEAKER_07]: With the game.

1048
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:18,210
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds more useful than Ping Pals.

1049
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:19,788
[SPEAKER_09]: on the DS.

1050
01:12:19,848 --> 01:12:20,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, almost.

1051
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:25,734
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sims 3 Fastlane stuff.

1052
01:12:25,894 --> 01:12:26,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to read this in our chat room.

1053
01:12:27,235 --> 01:12:30,618
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I got to catch up on some chat comments because the chat's starting to fill up here.

1054
01:12:30,678 --> 01:12:31,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to you guys for tuning in early.

1055
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:32,700
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

1056
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,301
[SPEAKER_09]: There's quite a few of you here tonight, so thank you guys.

1057
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:35,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.orangehamsradio.com.

1058
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:36,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1059
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:38,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Where was that?

1060
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1061
01:12:38,505 --> 01:12:40,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to say this about Rose.

1062
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:44,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Derek H., who brought up Cammy in the first place, actually says, I destroy people with Rose.

1063
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:45,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Destroy.

1064
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:47,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1065
01:12:47,353 --> 01:12:48,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Illusion Spark, bitches.

1066
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks like you and Derek have a lot in common because you're both Cammy and Rose players.

1067
01:12:53,197 --> 01:12:53,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1068
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:55,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Where was I?

1069
01:12:55,219 --> 01:12:56,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1070
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:56,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Start the party.

1071
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Entertainment says start the party.

1072
01:12:58,802 --> 01:13:00,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Gin, vodka, and hot women not included.

1073
01:13:01,804 --> 01:13:02,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Or fun.

1074
01:13:02,364 --> 01:13:04,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have vodka and tequila.

1075
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:05,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you?

1076
01:13:05,487 --> 01:13:05,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1077
01:13:05,687 --> 01:13:06,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want some?

1078
01:13:06,588 --> 01:13:06,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1079
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:08,609
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start the party right now.

1080
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:11,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, I need everyone to drink up my booze.

1081
01:13:12,915 --> 01:13:17,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have a little bit, but keep in mind, I gotta drive home when this is all over, so I'll get... You've got hours to get sober.

1082
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have a drink or two.

1083
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:21,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I could also run out and get dinner at some point, so I'll have, like, a beer.

1084
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:22,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a Guinness?

1085
01:13:22,185 --> 01:13:23,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a Guinness.

1086
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:23,867
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't have a Guinness.

1087
01:13:23,907 --> 01:13:24,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two Newcastles left.

1088
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:27,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle.

1089
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:28,199
[SPEAKER_05]: A few more games this week.

1090
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:28,919
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have Newcastle.

1091
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:30,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

1092
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,459
[SPEAKER_07]: UFC Undisputed 2010 on PSP.

1093
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Prison Tycoon Alcatraz, once again delayed.

1094
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Value Soft, for not being able to hit your damn street dates.

1095
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:43,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Dawn of Heroes on DS, speaking of delayed games.

1096
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:45,542
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be coming out this week, maybe.

1097
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:48,602
[SPEAKER_07]: King's Bounty Armored Princess.

1098
01:13:49,943 --> 01:13:51,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Not sure what that is, but...

1099
01:13:52,023 --> 01:13:52,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's on PC.

1100
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:59,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future on Nintendo DS.

1101
01:13:59,446 --> 01:14:01,007
[SPEAKER_07]: That comes out one week from today.

1102
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:03,708
[SPEAKER_09]: That is it.

1103
01:14:04,248 --> 01:14:04,528
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1104
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:08,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on and talk about Japanese release dates, looking at what's coming out in Japan.

1105
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:13,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off with the Xbox 360 on September 9th.

1106
01:14:13,892 --> 01:14:19,154
[SPEAKER_09]: UFC Undisputed 2010 is coming out on the Xbox 360 for those that are into that.

1107
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:21,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

1108
01:14:21,739 --> 01:14:26,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming out over there.

1109
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:27,962
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can find it.

1110
01:14:28,403 --> 01:14:28,803
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1111
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:32,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Split Second gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 3.

1112
01:14:33,085 --> 01:14:35,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, UFC Undisputed 2010 gets a release there, too.

1113
01:14:35,886 --> 01:14:37,847
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, next week, Front Mission Evolved.

1114
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know, that's on the 16th.

1115
01:14:40,668 --> 01:14:42,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Wanted to get that out there because I know there's a lot of Front Mission fans.

1116
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,630
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a cultish type of game.

1117
01:14:45,571 --> 01:14:47,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the Wii and what's coming out on the Wii...

1118
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:51,859
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Okami getting a price cut this week on the Wii.

1119
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:58,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Biohazard 4 is also getting a price cut and the Biohazard Chronicles.

1120
01:14:58,723 --> 01:15:02,164
[SPEAKER_09]: That of course is Resident Evil, what they call that series over there is Biohazard.

1121
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:11,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, One Piece Gigant Battle from Bandai Namco is coming out on the DS this week.

1122
01:15:11,949 --> 01:15:15,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea what that game is all about, but I'm assuming it's going to be a giant battle.

1123
01:15:32,356 --> 01:15:33,818
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it's called.

1124
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:56,769
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's coming out in Europe?

1125
01:15:56,809 --> 01:16:05,994
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 6th we have Chime for PC and then the 7th is Dragon Age Origins Witch Hunt and Mass Effect 2 Lair of the Shadow Broker and on the 8th we have Amnesia The Dark Descent and Plants vs. Zombies which is crack.

1126
01:16:21,904 --> 01:16:46,806
[SPEAKER_05]: and then on the 10th we have Ace Combat Joint Assault, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 which I don't know I'm still kind of giddy about Birth by Sleep but this amnesia thing sounds kind of interesting I was looking up a little bit about it too that I think it would be interesting to to see that one but

1127
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that coming out in the US?

1128
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:50,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Amnesia?

1129
01:16:50,826 --> 01:16:52,930
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dark Descent.

1130
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Frictional Games.

1131
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:55,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1132
01:16:57,433 --> 01:17:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: If it does, it'll be ported over by Zoo Games because they love taking European releases and bringing them out over here.

1133
01:17:03,775 --> 01:17:04,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually.

1134
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.

1135
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:11,817
[SPEAKER_07]: After they delayed them for months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months.

1136
01:17:11,837 --> 01:17:13,517
[SPEAKER_05]: But Plants vs. Zombies, that game is kind of crack.

1137
01:17:13,777 --> 01:17:19,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean... I'm actually looking... See, I'm looking forward to downloading that on the iPod when it comes in.

1138
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:22,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposed to get it next week because they're not yet released.

1139
01:17:22,799 --> 01:17:25,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be out on DS in January.

1140
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:25,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1141
01:17:26,823 --> 01:17:27,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1142
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, me being kind of a noob to the whole app store and stuff, I'm very pleased that they're not that expensive.

1143
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:44,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Except, I was actually shopping for something to use as like a Garmin or, you know, some sort of GPS thing.

1144
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:50,121
[SPEAKER_07]: To add GPS to the iPod Touch is ridiculously expensive.

1145
01:17:50,682 --> 01:17:53,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's a TomTom adapter.

1146
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:57,303
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $79.99 just for the GPS adapter.

1147
01:17:57,583 --> 01:18:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they want you to pay another $40 for the fucking app.

1148
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:08,666
[SPEAKER_07]: To which I gave them the big middle finger and said, fuck you, I will just look up directions on Google Maps and I'm smart enough as a human being to figure out how to get there.

1149
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:11,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not need you to tell me how to get there for almost $120.

1150
01:18:14,748 --> 01:18:14,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1151
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:18,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I better be getting free blowjobs for $120 from that thing, you know.

1152
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,271
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's not worth it.

1153
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:31,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and honestly, I mean, if you've got, you may as well just use Google Maps, because seriously, it's kind of like irritating, I think, when you have the speaking GPS.

1154
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I am going to get, though, I want to get one of these Virgin Mobile MiFis 2200s.

1155
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:44,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know that the MiFi 2200 is actually available through a bunch of different, like Verizon and Sprint and stuff like that.

1156
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:47,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're way more expensive and you have to have a contract.

1157
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:48,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm cheap.

1158
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:51,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes I don't want to pay my bills.

1159
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is perfect.

1160
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I heard about those devices.

1161
01:18:57,743 --> 01:18:58,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of want to get one.

1162
01:18:58,924 --> 01:18:59,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious.

1163
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:01,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting one for, we could do it for podcasting.

1164
01:19:01,828 --> 01:19:03,290
[SPEAKER_07]: You can connect with the five devices.

1165
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:05,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do like podcasting anywhere.

1166
01:19:06,054 --> 01:19:10,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, I'm just going to shove it in my pocket and I can use my iPod Touch like, you know,

1167
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:11,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a phone, basically.

1168
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I would worry about podcasting over 3G, though.

1169
01:19:14,462 --> 01:19:17,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we skip enough on this stream as it is.

1170
01:19:17,103 --> 01:19:22,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, 3G's not... It's like an average DSL connection.

1171
01:19:22,065 --> 01:19:25,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not horrible as long as you're in a decent area.

1172
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:28,968
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I don't know.

1173
01:19:29,008 --> 01:19:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't exactly use it for podcasting all the time.

1174
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:34,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe just surfing the web while I'm...

1175
01:19:35,038 --> 01:19:35,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Out there.

1176
01:19:35,858 --> 01:19:41,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the iPhone as far as surfing the web and stuff, but I don't want to pay the fees each month for it.

1177
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:46,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I don't really need the phone stuff too much.

1178
01:19:46,623 --> 01:19:49,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I use maybe, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes a month.

1179
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:53,866
[SPEAKER_07]: All these cell phone plans are way too expensive for what they give me.

1180
01:19:54,226 --> 01:20:00,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I have been looking at... They've been advertising the new Virgin Mobile ones, too, for $25 a month for everything.

1181
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:01,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just I don't like the phones for that.

1182
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only bad thing.

1183
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,791
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was like...

1184
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:07,594
[SPEAKER_07]: and iPhone for $25 a month then I'd be all over that shit.

1185
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:09,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

1186
01:20:09,776 --> 01:20:13,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not trying to sound like a peddler for Virgin Mobile.

1187
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:21,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about the PlayStation 3 and all sorts of weird stuff going on in the mod chip world there.

1188
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:36,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you may remember the PlayStation Jailbreak was, um, announced last week, and of course, you know, for a very expensive hundred and, I don't remember how much it was, $70 or something like that for it.

1189
01:20:36,839 --> 01:20:43,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, funny enough, um, you know, there was a temporary injunction placed on them last week where they were prevented from selling it until the 31st.

1190
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:46,445
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1191
01:21:13,179 --> 01:21:27,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone that bought one had their money returned, which is awesome because at the same time, the people that may have been buying them from Ozmodchips or even in the US, now Sony is going after the US manufacturers or I should say resellers.

1192
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:45,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they're going at, uh, against, uh, against ZumbaLDC, whose, um, website shopsjailbreak.com has been, uh, selling a new PS3 jailbreak mod chips for the very expensive price of like a hundred and, you know, a hundred and some dollars.

1193
01:21:46,593 --> 01:21:49,776
[SPEAKER_07]: PS Groove is an open source mod chip that runs off of a TNC++ USB development board or an 1890 USB key.

1194
01:22:09,677 --> 01:22:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of those run under $30-some dollars.

1195
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:22,245
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $24 for the one and about $31 for the other, which is a lot cheaper than $100-some dollars.

1196
01:22:22,885 --> 01:22:36,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's great about that is the part that kind of pissed off Sony with the whole backup manager, they actually have disabled the backup manager, but then of course people have released modified versions that have the backup manager in there again, but...

1197
01:22:36,973 --> 01:22:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a solution that is now widely available.

1198
01:22:39,435 --> 01:22:48,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sony, by snipping this other one in the butt, kind of made themselves a bigger problem.

1199
01:22:48,824 --> 01:22:58,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now they're actually porting the PlayStation Groove to the PSP, which will run as an application on there, on a homebrew console.

1200
01:22:59,973 --> 01:23:06,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll actually be able to use your PSP for free to mod your PlayStation 3 if you have that.

1201
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:14,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you can't wait for that to come out and you happen to have a Nokia N900, you can actually do that for free now.

1202
01:23:15,026 --> 01:23:23,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can connect that to your PlayStation 3 using the special port of the PlayStation Groove to crack your system.

1203
01:23:23,953 --> 01:23:24,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1204
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:26,936
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1205
01:23:46,690 --> 01:24:00,599
[SPEAKER_07]: The stealth version of it, which isn't entirely stealth yet because they haven't erased all the old ID code out of it, is making the game look like, or making it look like you're playing a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which a lot of people out there are, so it would be hard to track them down.

1206
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,661
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's only going to get worse for them now.

1207
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:12,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Because once you have this system out now to actually mod your system, people are going to find out ways to do custom firmwares and it only goes from there.

1208
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:13,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to snowball.

1209
01:24:15,785 --> 01:24:17,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything Sony can do about all this?

1210
01:24:17,826 --> 01:24:18,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they can.

1211
01:24:19,147 --> 01:24:23,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, other than, you know, maybe they can fix the hack.

1212
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:34,437
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently, from what I was reading, though, the way that they actually... This exploit is done is actually before the firmware.

1213
01:24:34,557 --> 01:24:38,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So to patch it with the firmware might be impossible.

1214
01:24:38,539 --> 01:24:40,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It's before the firmware actually kicks in.

1215
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:40,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1216
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:49,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's impossible maybe to do that, but they may be able to block the ID for the backup manager or something like that.

1217
01:24:50,088 --> 01:24:58,094
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's that easy to change the game ID on the backup manager, that won't really be an issue because they can just keep changing it to keep dodging any blocks that they put in place.

1218
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting.

1219
01:25:01,795 --> 01:25:07,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely they're going to be doing another update soon for either PlayStation Move stuff.

1220
01:25:07,137 --> 01:25:12,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they already have that Move stuff available right now, the firmware for that.

1221
01:25:12,339 --> 01:25:17,501
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're going to be doing the 3D Blu-ray stuff and who knows what other patches later on.

1222
01:25:17,521 --> 01:25:20,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're going to try to patch it, that's for sure.

1223
01:25:20,222 --> 01:25:24,204
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a feeling it's going to go back and forth just like the whole PSP stuff.

1224
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:27,126
[SPEAKER_09]: But you won't be able to play online with this, right?

1225
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:28,947
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be able to get that, right?

1226
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:32,770
[SPEAKER_07]: As of right now, see, here's the thing with online.

1227
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:41,557
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's the issue with playing with the backup manager because it shows that ID code and they can go, okay, this person's playing online with this ID code.

1228
01:25:41,897 --> 01:25:43,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, they're using the backup manager.

1229
01:25:43,258 --> 01:25:43,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Ban.

1230
01:25:43,898 --> 01:25:44,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We ban their console.

1231
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,102
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're changing it to mimic Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

1232
01:25:49,302 --> 01:25:51,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll look like, oh, they're playing Modern Warfare 2.

1233
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:55,073
[SPEAKER_07]: and then they're not going to ban them.

1234
01:25:55,614 --> 01:26:07,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they successfully mask the backup manager and make it look like Modern Warfare 2 then there really is nothing they can do as far as detecting which console is running this backup manager.

1235
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:11,641
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be tough.

1236
01:26:12,442 --> 01:26:13,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see what develops.

1237
01:26:14,304 --> 01:26:18,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious to see how Sony's long-term strategy of this plays out.

1238
01:26:18,749 --> 01:26:23,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like, yeah, they can try and stop this with the court orders and everything, but once the technology is out there, it's out there.

1239
01:26:23,374 --> 01:26:26,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be very hard to stop, especially when they're telling people how to make their own.

1240
01:26:26,417 --> 01:26:30,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're already starting to dump games too.

1241
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:37,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole scene now because the hard drives, you don't even really have to do too much.

1242
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,981
[SPEAKER_07]: You just can copy the file straight to your hard drive.

1243
01:26:42,102 --> 01:26:44,022
[SPEAKER_07]: People are just doing Blu-ray dumps.

1244
01:26:44,262 --> 01:26:50,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Would Spazinator be able to use this to get his videos to work when Sony keeps screwing them over with the whole new console and all that?

1245
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:51,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1246
01:26:51,925 --> 01:26:52,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1247
01:26:53,045 --> 01:26:53,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1248
01:26:54,066 --> 01:26:55,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's see.

1249
01:26:55,527 --> 01:26:58,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman in our chat room says, so people hacked a Sony system?

1250
01:26:58,369 --> 01:26:59,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that business as usual with Sony?

1251
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:01,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Not for the PS3.

1252
01:27:01,511 --> 01:27:02,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, not for the PS3.

1253
01:27:02,692 --> 01:27:11,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they really kind of rolled this out as unhackable and for a while it certainly seemed that way, although we all knew in the back of our heads somebody would hack it eventually.

1254
01:27:11,738 --> 01:27:12,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's finally coming around.

1255
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:20,484
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the fact that Blu-ray hasn't really been easily adopted into burning and all that yet, it's still got a ways to go, I think, before you're going to see like, you know,

1256
01:27:21,624 --> 01:27:23,226
[SPEAKER_09]: mass market piracy for this.

1257
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:25,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know.

1258
01:27:25,027 --> 01:27:29,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But they keep claiming piracy killed the PSP, but I don't know.

1259
01:27:29,271 --> 01:27:30,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I have mixed feelings on that.

1260
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's totally right.

1261
01:27:31,432 --> 01:27:35,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good scapegoat because they don't really, it's hard to tell what the numbers are actually on that.

1262
01:27:37,537 --> 01:27:41,881
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I'm sure it contributed to it, but then again, look at the Nintendo DS.

1263
01:27:41,961 --> 01:27:50,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that system is doing really well, and I don't, I mean, I know piracy has affected that, but it's hard to say, and

1264
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:52,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1265
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting to see what happens.

1266
01:27:57,242 --> 01:27:58,883
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

1267
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:00,484
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be fun to play around with, I think.

1268
01:28:01,845 --> 01:28:02,145
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1269
01:28:03,285 --> 01:28:11,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on to another story about the Xbox 360 this time and some price changes going on on the 360.

1270
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,730
[SPEAKER_09]: This was news that came out this week.

1271
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:18,333
[SPEAKER_09]: A one-month gold subscription to Xbox Live is going up.

1272
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:21,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting November 1st, $8 to $10.

1273
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:24,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Three months, going up from $20 to $25.

1274
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And a full year of Xbox Live, up $50 to $60.

1275
01:28:26,588 --> 01:28:28,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's really $49.99 to $59.

1276
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:29,150
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $50 to $60.

1277
01:28:38,067 --> 01:28:41,812
[SPEAKER_09]: The price of Xbox Live has gone up, folks.

1278
01:28:41,952 --> 01:28:48,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's interesting about this story, it's the first time we've ever had this story in the history of our show, which has been going about as long as Xbox Live has.

1279
01:28:48,762 --> 01:28:52,046
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't raised the price in the years that it's been active.

1280
01:28:52,547 --> 01:28:54,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it justified that they raise the price now?

1281
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:55,731
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1282
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:58,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of thought it was about time.

1283
01:28:59,862 --> 01:29:12,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you gotta keep up with the market and if you're not making enough to match cost and still have the right profit margin they're expecting, then I don't see why not.

1284
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:36,902
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way if you're worried about this price increase there are some ways you can lock in the old price you can do a renewal of one year through xbox.com right now for 40 bucks or you can also buy some of those prepaid cards right now with the lower prices because you know you can still find those for the old prices and if you load up on a couple of those then you'll be locked in for however much time and dude it's seriously like 80 some cents more a month

1285
01:29:38,328 --> 01:29:39,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what it is averaged out.

1286
01:29:40,009 --> 01:29:41,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, $10 more?

1287
01:29:42,171 --> 01:29:44,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that is more money for you to pay.

1288
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:49,715
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, look at what the hell download content in your Xbox Live Arcade games cost that much.

1289
01:29:49,755 --> 01:29:53,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that everybody's cash strapped nowadays with the economy and everything.

1290
01:29:53,718 --> 01:29:54,679
[SPEAKER_07]: But come on!

1291
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:57,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Take... Eat one less lunch out or something.

1292
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, stop fucking bitching about $10.

1293
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like the price is doubling.

1294
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:04,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that you may not use all the features.

1295
01:30:04,581 --> 01:30:08,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Because honestly, I don't use most of the features on Xbox Live.

1296
01:30:08,922 --> 01:30:09,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't use Twitter.

1297
01:30:09,642 --> 01:30:10,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't use Facebook.

1298
01:30:11,283 --> 01:30:12,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, none of the extra stuff.

1299
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:14,844
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the ESPN streaming and stuff like that.

1300
01:30:15,004 --> 01:30:16,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I could care less about it.

1301
01:30:16,604 --> 01:30:20,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that it's going up $10, it doesn't really bother me because...

1302
01:30:21,105 --> 01:30:49,671
[SPEAKER_09]: you know so what well speaking of ESPN in our chat room Blaze says given that this ESPN functionality is supposed to be absurdly amazing then it's not that big a deal Breakman says fuck you Microsoft everyone kept asking them when Xbox Live will go free so they said fuck you we'll raise the price I'm okay with this price hike because they haven't done one in so long and it does seem like you know the amount of content on Xbox Live there's a lot of it there I'm okay with it you know because we're talking on a yearly basis too

1303
01:30:51,175 --> 01:30:56,537
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is where we're going instead of the online pass, I'm okay with it.

1304
01:30:56,938 --> 01:30:59,118
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, I think we all know it's not.

1305
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:01,079
[SPEAKER_09]: That online pass still exists.

1306
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:04,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And to me, you can't do this and that.

1307
01:31:05,981 --> 01:31:10,323
[SPEAKER_09]: This online pass is ridiculous in the first place, but it's even more so with this.

1308
01:31:10,523 --> 01:31:13,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't blame Microsoft for the online pass stuff.

1309
01:31:13,405 --> 01:31:15,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame the third-party publishers for that.

1310
01:31:15,686 --> 01:31:16,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft could stop it.

1311
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:20,083
[SPEAKER_09]: It's their servers, their store.

1312
01:31:20,103 --> 01:31:20,823
[SPEAKER_07]: They can stop.

1313
01:31:20,963 --> 01:31:21,944
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their software, though.

1314
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:25,645
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want to prevent people from connecting online, they can do that.

1315
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:27,966
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their software.

1316
01:31:28,026 --> 01:31:38,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that they should step up and say, hey, you shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff on our service because they made everybody play nice with the guitar controllers and stuff like that.

1317
01:31:38,651 --> 01:31:39,771
[SPEAKER_07]: They all had to work together.

1318
01:31:41,492 --> 01:31:42,653
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of cool, but...

1319
01:31:43,753 --> 01:31:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1320
01:31:59,378 --> 01:32:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: like if Microsoft said oh by the way we're going to charge you $10 to play this game online or I'm sorry Microsoft said no we're going to charge you $10 extra to play this game online if you buy it used then there might be some issues but I don't think they're going to go that route because they're making enough money as it is on live and maybe they try supporting it with ad revenue and stuff like that and maybe it's just the cost to run this stuff keeps going up and up I mean they keep adding you know

1321
01:32:28,559 --> 01:32:30,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Features and stuff to it.

1322
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's just getting more expensive.

1323
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1324
01:32:34,861 --> 01:32:40,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do feel the value of $50 for Xbox Live now is certainly better than it was 8 years ago.

1325
01:32:40,743 --> 01:32:42,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is cool.

1326
01:32:42,383 --> 01:32:46,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that they would just say, we want to make more money so we're going to raise the price.

1327
01:32:46,864 --> 01:32:54,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they would actually say, because they're going to try to keep it as low as possible to stay competitive with the PlayStation Network.

1328
01:32:55,527 --> 01:32:55,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And

1329
01:32:56,667 --> 01:33:00,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see them raising prices just because, oh, we need to make more money.

1330
01:33:01,112 --> 01:33:04,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just that the cost of doing things is going up.

1331
01:33:04,616 --> 01:33:17,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Blaze said, remember that this online pass stuff applies to games that are multi-console, and Microsoft requires an online play go through their servers, but Sony makes third-party people run their own servers.

1332
01:33:18,757 --> 01:33:24,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, but still, then put the online pass on Sony, not Microsoft.

1333
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, though... Stop being lazy and just putting out the same code for both systems.

1334
01:33:27,399 --> 01:33:35,581
[SPEAKER_07]: If people are that pissed off about a $10 price hike, then you need to spend the extra effort it's going to take to go and find those cards for cheaper.

1335
01:33:35,942 --> 01:33:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, they're...

1336
01:33:37,842 --> 01:33:38,983
[SPEAKER_07]: There are cards out there.

1337
01:33:39,023 --> 01:33:41,885
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of ways to get cards for like 40 bucks now.

1338
01:33:42,445 --> 01:33:44,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, go stock up on some of those.

1339
01:33:44,867 --> 01:33:56,915
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're so concerned about spending the extra 83 cents a month, I mean, seriously, go for a walk around your local strip malls and stuff like that.

1340
01:33:56,955 --> 01:33:59,177
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably find 83 cents on the ground.

1341
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:01,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not that fucking expensive.

1342
01:34:02,099 --> 01:34:04,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, go without a can of soda one week, you know?

1343
01:34:05,781 --> 01:34:06,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 83 cents a month.

1344
01:34:06,922 --> 01:34:07,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's break that down by week.

1345
01:34:08,004 --> 01:34:12,168
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like 20 cents a week.

1346
01:34:12,548 --> 01:34:13,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

1347
01:34:13,769 --> 01:34:14,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Find a dime.

1348
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:18,474
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that it's not that much money, but here you go, you devil's advocate.

1349
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:19,975
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the principle.

1350
01:34:20,456 --> 01:34:24,700
[SPEAKER_09]: They're raising the price, and what are they doing to justify the raising of the price?

1351
01:34:25,168 --> 01:34:29,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, people aren't too worried about paying $60 for games.

1352
01:34:29,653 --> 01:34:36,381
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a $10 price hike per game, so why aren't you just still playing your original PlayStation 2 and Xbox then?

1353
01:34:36,681 --> 01:34:42,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Why aren't you boycotting all these different game systems since it's so expensive for you to spend the extra $10?

1354
01:34:43,389 --> 01:34:45,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're a fucking hypocrite is what I think you are.

1355
01:34:46,809 --> 01:34:51,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman in our chatroom says, I'll pay Microsoft an extra $10 a month to take Facebook off my 360.

1356
01:34:53,075 --> 01:34:53,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen to that.

1357
01:34:53,675 --> 01:34:55,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook on 360 is ugly.

1358
01:34:55,517 --> 01:34:58,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it looks better on a cell phone, and that is saying a lot.

1359
01:34:59,381 --> 01:34:59,661
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1360
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:03,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on and get into the classic video game of the week.

1361
01:35:03,524 --> 01:35:11,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane where DarkSakura will dig into the gamer vault and find a game that she thinks, hey...

1362
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,194
[SPEAKER_09]: You kids out there in internet land.

1363
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:15,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Get off my lawn and play this game.

1364
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:18,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Get off my lawn and go inside and play this game.

1365
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:21,862
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1366
01:35:22,623 --> 01:35:24,004
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Men for the Sega Genesis.

1367
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:27,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, not this little player arcade.

1368
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to save something for the future, Rob.

1369
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:31,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, um...

1370
01:35:33,092 --> 01:35:35,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, I think, one of the best games that came on the Genesis.

1371
01:35:36,259 --> 01:35:38,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in 1993, and it was the whole 90s era of X-Men.

1372
01:35:45,087 --> 01:35:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: and the game basically starts off where you're in the danger room and there's a virus that goes into the danger room so you have to go through different areas within the danger room and then fight Magneto at the end.

1373
01:35:58,341 --> 01:36:03,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So you play as Gambit or Nightcrawler, Wolverine or Cyclops and they have...

1374
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:06,856
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1375
01:36:24,635 --> 01:36:30,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, with Wolverine, he basically has his big bad claws and his healing factor.

1376
01:36:32,143 --> 01:36:35,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Gambit has his charged cards for a special attack.

1377
01:36:35,908 --> 01:36:37,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Cyclops has the optic blast.

1378
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:41,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nightcrawler has the ability to teleport, which is useful.

1379
01:36:41,234 --> 01:36:42,916
[SPEAKER_05]: He was actually my favorite character to use in the game.

1380
01:36:43,576 --> 01:36:51,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You also get Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel as sort of helpers.

1381
01:36:51,864 --> 01:36:52,985
[SPEAKER_05]: You can call on them for help.

1382
01:36:53,926 --> 01:36:56,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also get Jean Grey to pop up if you happen to fall.

1383
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And you fight different X-Men villains, so it's pretty cool.

1384
01:36:59,952 --> 01:37:04,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the cool things about this game, and it had a... It broke the fourth wall, Bob.

1385
01:37:06,457 --> 01:37:06,737
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

1386
01:37:07,818 --> 01:37:15,322
[SPEAKER_05]: It, um... When you defeat Mojo, you have to reset the computer in the Danger Room, but what it really means is reset your machine.

1387
01:37:16,503 --> 01:37:25,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole trick is that you just sort of have to pop the reset button, and then it'll black out and pop up these numbers like a computer rebooting, you know, in the 90s.

1388
01:37:25,748 --> 01:37:27,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So what, somebody's 486, I guess?

1389
01:37:28,529 --> 01:37:28,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1390
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... But, uh, we had a giggle from Loki about something...

1391
01:37:35,313 --> 01:37:38,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Something with someone posing.

1392
01:37:39,177 --> 01:37:39,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious now.

1393
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:46,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we wait until after the classic game?

1394
01:37:46,163 --> 01:37:51,527
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I need to point out is that if you hit the button too hard, of course, it will reset the game and you're like SOL.

1395
01:37:52,288 --> 01:37:59,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you have a Nomad, the Nomad doesn't have a reset button, so you're SOL there unless you level skip.

1396
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:18,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, all of the music in the game was done by Fletcher Beasley, who used the Genesis emulation music software, and it would work with the Yamaha 2612 FM synthesizer chip on the Genesis, so you could play the sounds back through it and you'd know what it sounded like.

1397
01:38:18,822 --> 01:38:20,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually got a really cool soundtrack.

1398
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it sounds really good.

1399
01:38:23,263 --> 01:38:23,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1400
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:32,626
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's quoted as saying that he was trying to use the sound of the distorted guitar in his tracks to make them sound edgier.

1401
01:38:33,447 --> 01:38:35,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, it's got a great soundtrack.

1402
01:38:35,607 --> 01:38:36,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos to him.

1403
01:38:37,108 --> 01:38:38,108
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a really cool game.

1404
01:38:38,268 --> 01:38:43,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually, there's one level in that game that pissed me off to no end and it was always the Mojo World level.

1405
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Hated it.

1406
01:38:46,771 --> 01:38:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

1407
01:38:49,812 --> 01:38:50,592
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fighting mode.

1408
01:38:51,952 --> 01:38:52,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Mojo Jojo.

1409
01:38:53,573 --> 01:38:54,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

1410
01:38:55,965 --> 01:39:01,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there you go, your classic game of the week is X-Men on the Genesis.

1411
01:39:01,989 --> 01:39:02,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1412
01:39:03,469 --> 01:39:04,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, DarkSakura.

1413
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:09,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Good pick, even if I'm more of a fan of the arcade one, but that's okay.

1414
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:11,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Loki, why are you giggling?

1415
01:39:12,114 --> 01:39:18,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nothing, there was someone who was pointing out, actually one of our listeners, they were pointing out that

1416
01:39:18,898 --> 01:39:22,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard that... Have you seen the story about Earth Defense Force?

1417
01:39:22,843 --> 01:39:24,685
[SPEAKER_07]: A new Earth Defense Force game coming out next year.

1418
01:39:25,245 --> 01:39:27,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually clicked on the link to check it out.

1419
01:39:27,908 --> 01:39:37,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it links the Structoid article that links also a CheapAssGamer article where I'm the source of that news information.

1420
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:37,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1421
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like...

1422
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:40,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard about it.

1423
01:39:40,761 --> 01:39:41,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm looking at this.

1424
01:39:41,602 --> 01:39:43,682
[SPEAKER_09]: This was just, what's today, the 5th?

1425
01:39:44,322 --> 01:39:45,963
[SPEAKER_09]: This was like four hours ago.

1426
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:50,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the GameStop conference, I think they had an actual logo for it.

1427
01:39:50,624 --> 01:39:59,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you go to edfia.com, you can check out, they have the placeholder logo for Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.

1428
01:40:00,347 --> 01:40:04,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Launch Radio Podcast co-host Loki has recently uncovered a sequel to the B-movie quality Earth Defense Force 2017.

1429
01:40:17,997 --> 01:40:20,359
[SPEAKER_09]: If this news is correct, then all is well with the world.

1430
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:23,120
[SPEAKER_09]: The game falls under the same category as Deadly Premonition for me.

1431
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:30,764
[SPEAKER_09]: According to his information, Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon for the Xbox 360 is being released sometime in February 2011 by D3 Publisher.

1432
01:40:31,105 --> 01:40:36,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, who works for a game distributor and has a strong track record on things such as unannounced games, tweeted the following.

1433
01:40:36,608 --> 01:40:42,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saw this on my release list from D3 Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon coming February on Xbox 360.

1434
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:43,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, wasn't that like a month ago?

1435
01:40:44,232 --> 01:40:45,973
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1436
01:41:10,413 --> 01:41:10,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops!

1437
01:41:11,613 --> 01:41:16,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want D3 being pissed off at me because then that comes back to me and then I lose my job.

1438
01:41:16,675 --> 01:41:18,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you gotta stop putting on Twitter.

1439
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:23,177
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do it here on the show in Secret Club where these people don't listen.

1440
01:41:23,517 --> 01:41:27,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a crazy person that says these things, okay?

1441
01:41:27,739 --> 01:41:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just meant for sharing with the listeners, not to be as posted as a story.

1442
01:41:35,442 --> 01:41:44,072
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so when Joystick picks this article up, say four months from now, and they're like, hey, we just discovered that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1443
01:41:44,172 --> 01:41:47,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it'd be like, hey, I knew about that months ago.

1444
01:41:47,695 --> 01:41:49,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

1445
01:41:49,998 --> 01:41:52,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so you can realize that we knew it first.

1446
01:41:53,121 --> 01:41:55,983
[SPEAKER_09]: They better not be mad at you because you know what?

1447
01:41:56,003 --> 01:41:57,944
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been supporting this game from the beginning.

1448
01:41:57,964 --> 01:41:58,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It is so awesome.

1449
01:41:59,065 --> 01:41:59,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so excited.

1450
01:41:59,485 --> 01:42:01,767
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably helped this sequel happen, honestly.

1451
01:42:01,967 --> 01:42:03,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know anyone who talks about this with you.

1452
01:42:03,488 --> 01:42:03,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It is so awesome.

1453
01:42:03,968 --> 01:42:06,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I own four copies of this game, okay?

1454
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:08,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know why I did that?

1455
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:11,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in case ever one of my discs breaks.

1456
01:42:11,112 --> 01:42:12,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one of them has?

1457
01:42:12,253 --> 01:42:13,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I played it so much.

1458
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:16,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had three backup copies I bought.

1459
01:42:16,996 --> 01:42:19,238
[SPEAKER_07]: We were clearing them out of our warehouse for five bucks each.

1460
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:20,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm taking all of those.

1461
01:42:21,739 --> 01:42:24,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I love this game.

1462
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And I fully support the sequel.

1463
01:42:27,443 --> 01:42:29,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope to God it has four-player co-op.

1464
01:42:29,444 --> 01:42:30,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I borrow one?

1465
01:42:30,685 --> 01:42:32,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually looked for the game.

1466
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:33,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't able to find it.

1467
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:34,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.

1468
01:42:34,528 --> 01:42:34,788
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1469
01:42:35,268 --> 01:42:36,749
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, lesson learned here.

1470
01:42:36,889 --> 01:42:37,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

1471
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:39,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Posting Loki's stuff.

1472
01:42:40,271 --> 01:42:40,972
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't care.

1473
01:42:41,272 --> 01:42:41,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't.

1474
01:42:42,633 --> 01:42:42,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.

1475
01:42:43,233 --> 01:42:45,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they would have said something by now.

1476
01:42:45,935 --> 01:42:46,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's true.

1477
01:42:46,976 --> 01:42:48,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It was out there a month ago.

1478
01:42:48,336 --> 01:42:51,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I mean, it's... The official logo showed up now.

1479
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:55,241
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the official websites up and the GameStop conference.

1480
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:56,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone took a picture.

1481
01:42:56,101 --> 01:42:57,302
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Earth Defense Force returns 2011.

1482
01:42:57,342 --> 01:42:58,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1483
01:42:58,342 --> 01:42:59,603
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a banner for it.

1484
01:42:59,843 --> 01:43:01,304
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happening.

1485
01:43:01,564 --> 01:43:06,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so the story that went up four hours ago then is like behind because this has already been confirmed.

1486
01:43:06,127 --> 01:43:07,528
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no longer a rumor.

1487
01:43:07,668 --> 01:43:11,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, Destructoid, they ran their story 16 hours ago, apparently.

1488
01:43:12,231 --> 01:43:17,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just picked up on... Neo games are fun, I guess.

1489
01:43:17,654 --> 01:43:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: They ran... This was posted yesterday.

1490
01:43:22,457 --> 01:43:24,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So... I don't know.

1491
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:26,160
[SPEAKER_07]: People are just figuring it out now.

1492
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,921
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's why you gotta read my stuff closely.

1493
01:43:29,502 --> 01:43:29,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

1494
01:43:32,042 --> 01:43:37,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Destructoid called D3 to get confirmation, so maybe you'll be in the office on Tuesday.

1495
01:43:37,245 --> 01:43:37,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Who told you that?

1496
01:43:40,606 --> 01:43:42,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they referenced CheapAssGamer.

1497
01:43:44,348 --> 01:43:49,750
[SPEAKER_07]: But they also have NeoGAF, though, right above that link, if you noticed.

1498
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:51,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, you know what?

1499
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:54,912
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of fucked up, though, because it really wasn't CheapAssGamer.

1500
01:43:55,072 --> 01:44:00,495
[SPEAKER_09]: It's somebody on a blog on CheapAssGamer who starts off by referencing you.

1501
01:44:02,259 --> 01:44:05,641
[SPEAKER_09]: That really was not CheapAssGamer doing that at all.

1502
01:44:05,741 --> 01:44:06,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It had nothing to do with that.

1503
01:44:06,722 --> 01:44:07,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It was that user.

1504
01:44:08,103 --> 01:44:10,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So either that user or you should have been credited.

1505
01:44:11,927 --> 01:44:12,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying.

1506
01:44:13,007 --> 01:44:13,428
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.

1507
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:15,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care that I'm not credited.

1508
01:44:15,329 --> 01:44:16,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

1509
01:44:16,771 --> 01:44:19,153
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Blueswim, which I believe is one of our listeners.

1510
01:44:19,173 --> 01:44:20,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've heard that name before.

1511
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:22,415
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of our listeners.

1512
01:44:22,455 --> 01:44:22,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

1513
01:44:22,836 --> 01:44:26,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That website does little personal blog things and he's excited about this game like you are.

1514
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,080
[SPEAKER_07]: As he should.

1515
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:28,881
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1516
01:44:49,705 --> 01:44:50,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1517
01:44:50,566 --> 01:44:51,146
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

1518
01:44:51,646 --> 01:44:51,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1519
01:44:52,487 --> 01:44:53,007
[SPEAKER_09]: We're over it.

1520
01:44:53,027 --> 01:44:53,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get past this.

1521
01:44:53,447 --> 01:44:53,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm over it.

1522
01:44:53,907 --> 01:44:54,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's get past this.

1523
01:44:55,228 --> 01:44:56,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of funny.

1524
01:44:56,169 --> 01:44:58,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to beg them, though, for a copy of that game.

1525
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:00,471
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to send that to me now!

1526
01:45:01,292 --> 01:45:02,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

1527
01:45:02,552 --> 01:45:04,413
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1528
01:45:04,714 --> 01:45:05,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's the marathon, folks.

1529
01:45:06,014 --> 01:45:06,995
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about...

1530
01:45:07,415 --> 01:45:08,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost two hours in already.

1531
01:45:08,956 --> 01:45:10,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've got plenty more show to come.

1532
01:45:10,957 --> 01:45:12,218
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have the main show.

1533
01:45:12,318 --> 01:45:27,368
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to do Twitter topics, rapid fire stories, some news about the iPod Touch we're going to get into, some iPod related news, Xbox Live Arcade, price drop for the DSi, the mailbags, the FUs, all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1534
01:45:27,908 --> 01:45:29,629
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are going to be taking a music break here.

1535
01:45:29,869 --> 01:45:31,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be editing the podcast a little differently.

1536
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:34,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to kind of jump skip into the next segment.

1537
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:37,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize for the sloppy editing, but we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast.

1538
01:45:38,593 --> 01:45:40,854
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to take a quick break though here in studio.

1539
01:45:42,414 --> 01:45:43,315
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do some music.

1540
01:45:43,355 --> 01:45:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, today's break music is like all music that we used to play on OLR when we were an actual station back in what, like 2002, 2003?

1541
01:45:51,698 --> 01:45:51,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1542
01:45:53,839 --> 01:46:00,095
[SPEAKER_09]: because we're awesome that way yes so we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio don't go anywhere about five minutes marathon continues

1543
01:46:06,004 --> 01:46:06,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio

1544
01:46:27,122 --> 01:46:27,983
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1545
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:50,901
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1546
01:47:07,518 --> 01:47:11,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So Twitter topics, if you're hearing my voice and you want to get some Twitter topics in, send those in.

1547
01:47:11,681 --> 01:47:14,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?

1548
01:47:14,402 --> 01:47:22,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hey, on Twitter topics, guys, try to refrain from just linking us to news stories because we have a lot coming up later in the marathon, too.

1549
01:47:22,287 --> 01:47:25,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that we don't appreciate that, but we probably are covering it at some point.

1550
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:31,853
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you have good questions or feedback on an earlier story or something, that's definitely what we're looking for tonight.

1551
01:47:32,293 --> 01:47:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.

1552
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:39,238
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an Easter egg discovered from Wave Race Blue Storm.

1553
01:47:39,818 --> 01:47:41,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that old game.

1554
01:47:41,559 --> 01:47:45,562
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually just found a... What was it?

1555
01:47:45,962 --> 01:47:51,846
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an Easter egg that kind of changes some of the announcer audio in the game.

1556
01:47:51,926 --> 01:47:57,750
[SPEAKER_07]: He starts berating you, and then also, for some reason, when you do your boost, it goes, which is...

1557
01:47:59,091 --> 01:48:01,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure Irene would get a kick out of that.

1558
01:48:02,398 --> 01:48:05,464
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's interesting though.

1559
01:48:05,864 --> 01:48:10,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it's just a key press that you do on one of the options screens.

1560
01:48:12,656 --> 01:48:18,900
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny that games, even though they're out that long, that some Easter eggs haven't been discovered yet.

1561
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:24,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember there was one a couple weeks ago about a Splinter Cell game.

1562
01:48:25,004 --> 01:48:36,212
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually had it where there was a secret mission where you had to recover or had to find all these space seals that were hidden in the game.

1563
01:48:36,632 --> 01:48:40,234
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a special save the seals mission, which is kind of weird.

1564
01:48:41,715 --> 01:48:47,299
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a game from Activision called Blood Drive.

1565
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:51,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the information has been leaked out from the BBFC.

1566
01:48:52,703 --> 01:48:53,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I also saw it on their list.

1567
01:48:55,465 --> 01:48:58,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is going to be a combat racing game.

1568
01:48:59,347 --> 01:49:07,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the marketing shill, as they put it, is Shaun of the Dead meets Mad Max in Death Race.

1569
01:49:08,153 --> 01:49:11,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically a game that's cheesy and very gory.

1570
01:49:11,595 --> 01:49:12,296
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like fun.

1571
01:49:12,416 --> 01:49:13,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it sounds awesome.

1572
01:49:13,677 --> 01:49:17,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is somewhat budget priced.

1573
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $50 retail.

1574
01:49:19,182 --> 01:49:21,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll be coming out in November.

1575
01:49:21,884 --> 01:49:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be cool.

1576
01:49:24,226 --> 01:49:26,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm down for combat racing games.

1577
01:49:26,388 --> 01:49:29,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And cheesy is good, as long as it's a good game.

1578
01:49:29,911 --> 01:49:33,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily a terrible driving game.

1579
01:49:33,954 --> 01:49:34,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1580
01:49:55,041 --> 01:50:03,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, in case you're still curious about it, it is a port of a German Wii game developed by Sproing.

1581
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:13,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess you'll practice 20 unique choreographies and dance your way from the street stage all the way to the TV studio.

1582
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:18,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Under the watchful eye of Detlef D. Soest.

1583
01:50:20,965 --> 01:50:21,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Some douche.

1584
01:50:22,166 --> 01:50:28,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is basically some German dancer, choreographer.

1585
01:50:29,272 --> 01:50:29,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said.

1586
01:50:31,774 --> 01:50:36,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, like I said before, it's a terrible game.

1587
01:50:36,738 --> 01:50:38,880
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it doesn't play very well.

1588
01:50:40,021 --> 01:50:45,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at the screenshots that they have of it, it's got this really weird...

1589
01:50:48,051 --> 01:50:57,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like a note highway or something, but it's sort of like DDR where they've got arrows coming down the screen, but it's two different rows of arrows, as you can see right here.

1590
01:50:58,217 --> 01:51:05,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to kind of move your controllers in different directions to match the different analog sticks.

1591
01:51:06,081 --> 01:51:09,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And while that might be cool and stuff to do on, like, say...

1592
01:51:11,805 --> 01:51:13,107
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a dance pad or something.

1593
01:51:13,527 --> 01:51:20,136
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really awkward on the controller, especially since one side doesn't correspond to certain directions.

1594
01:51:20,216 --> 01:51:21,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just mixed all over the place.

1595
01:51:22,439 --> 01:51:25,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh... The music's terrible, so...

1596
01:51:26,024 --> 01:51:26,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't buy it.

1597
01:51:27,024 --> 01:51:28,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, you need to buy some other games.

1598
01:51:29,245 --> 01:51:31,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Plants vs. Zombies might be this week.

1599
01:51:32,546 --> 01:51:32,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Check that out.

1600
01:51:33,706 --> 01:51:45,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, of course, the new iPod Touch with iOS 4, the Retina display, and Game Center has been revealed at the new Apple event that was this week.

1601
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:52,233
[SPEAKER_07]: is available in an 8GB model for $229, 32GB for $299, and a 64GB model for $399.

1602
01:51:52,574 --> 01:52:06,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It is coming out next week, and it basically has all the wonderful features of the new iPhone 4, except, of course, no GPS, no phone, and much cheaper, I think.

1603
01:52:07,043 --> 01:52:09,485
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I will be picking one of those up myself.

1604
01:52:09,745 --> 01:52:19,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, some of the other stuff that they announced at the event, of course, the new Apple TV for $99, which is kind of cool, I guess, if you're into that.

1605
01:52:20,149 --> 01:52:29,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And then something else that was kind of cool, one of the things that they're really kind of pushing that the iPhone and iPod is like a gaming platform.

1606
01:52:29,492 --> 01:52:35,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Project Sword, which is a game that's running on the Unreal 3 engine and is coming out from Epic.

1607
01:52:36,196 --> 01:52:37,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually looks pretty good.

1608
01:52:38,277 --> 01:52:42,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a sword fighting game that is focused on one-on-one battles.

1609
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:48,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of like... Oh, there's some Wii game that came out that's kind of similar to that.

1610
01:52:49,224 --> 01:52:50,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully not like the Castlevania fighting game.

1611
01:52:51,385 --> 01:52:51,566
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1612
01:52:52,626 --> 01:52:58,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks pretty good, and it's kind of amazing to see that they have ported the Unreal 3 engine to iOS.

1613
01:53:00,058 --> 01:53:00,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat.

1614
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:01,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Neat.

1615
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:02,822
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1616
01:53:04,605 --> 01:53:07,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Alan, you were telling me about something earlier that you'd seen about this whole mess, right?

1617
01:53:08,383 --> 01:53:19,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been reading on Joystick and Kotaku about a free tech demo that Epic released this week called Epic Citadel for the iPhone 4 and also for the new iPod Touches that are coming out.

1618
01:53:19,726 --> 01:53:23,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the engine that this sword game is going to be running on.

1619
01:53:24,308 --> 01:53:26,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much just you and the touch interface in a town.

1620
01:53:28,209 --> 01:53:30,850
[SPEAKER_03]: and all you can do is really just walk around and look at stuff.

1621
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:38,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But the graphics, I guess, the way they ported the Unreal Engine into the phone is so good that you just can't believe that you're getting this on an iPhone.

1622
01:53:38,893 --> 01:53:42,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And the videos for it, for those that want to look it up on Google, it's called Epic Citadel.

1623
01:53:42,814 --> 01:53:44,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free on the App Store.

1624
01:53:44,895 --> 01:53:47,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So whoever has a new iPhone can download it and check it out.

1625
01:53:47,217 --> 01:53:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be amazing.

1626
01:53:48,278 --> 01:53:48,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm downloading it right now.

1627
01:53:49,038 --> 01:53:55,123
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's really sad is all they would really have to do now with the iPhone to really kind of compete in the market.

1628
01:53:55,183 --> 01:53:59,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, they already are competing in the market with like the Nintendo DS and the PSP, but they're really kind of...

1629
01:53:59,867 --> 01:54:01,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they came out at the conference.

1630
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:07,991
[SPEAKER_09]: They took a shot at Nintendo and Sony and said that they've sold more than those two combined, although it's fuzzy math.

1631
01:54:08,071 --> 01:54:09,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand.

1632
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:09,912
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm downloading it.

1633
01:54:09,952 --> 01:54:22,159
[SPEAKER_07]: But to basically kind of deliver that finishing blow, if you would put it, if they added some sort of actual buttons, some sort of controller interface to that, it would be – I mean, how are you going to compete with that?

1634
01:54:22,199 --> 01:54:24,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, now you've got a platform that's very popular.

1635
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,821
[SPEAKER_07]: The apps are really cheap.

1636
01:54:26,381 --> 01:54:53,745
[SPEAKER_03]: and the games are actually getting to be on par if not better than some of the stuff that's on the PSP and on the DS yeah it really is the one thing the iPhone, iTouch, whatever is missing is a tangible controller I mean if they could have that it would be amazing when you were playing Sonic 2 on the iPhone 4 at the Apple store they had to bring the screen in a little bit to like a little thumbnail so that it could put a little digital D-pad and buttons on there and it really affected the gameplay

1637
01:54:54,335 --> 01:54:54,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I sure did.

1638
01:54:57,117 --> 01:54:57,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1639
01:54:57,517 --> 01:55:03,320
[SPEAKER_09]: An AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom at chat.orangeandre.com agrees, seriously, Apple just needs to make a controller shell for it.

1640
01:55:03,901 --> 01:55:04,141
[SPEAKER_09]: K.O.

1641
01:55:04,181 --> 01:55:08,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Ray in our chatroom says, yes, Epic Citadel is all eye candy and it looks sweet.

1642
01:55:08,223 --> 01:55:08,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's something.

1643
01:55:09,584 --> 01:55:12,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've kind of thrown this idea out for a while now.

1644
01:55:13,647 --> 01:55:15,628
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what if Apple made a gaming console?

1645
01:55:15,668 --> 01:55:17,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what if they did?

1646
01:55:17,929 --> 01:55:19,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the Apple TV's down to $99.

1647
01:55:20,071 --> 01:55:23,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's to say they can't come up with some sort of wireless Bluetooth controller or something that

1648
01:55:24,173 --> 01:55:26,255
[SPEAKER_09]: All they have to do is put iOS on that box.

1649
01:55:26,395 --> 01:55:29,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, iOS on the box to make it a wireless controller.

1650
01:55:29,478 --> 01:55:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a little bit more powerful, kind of like an iPhone or something like that.

1651
01:55:34,723 --> 01:55:36,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Then now your games are really cheap.

1652
01:55:36,264 --> 01:55:39,768
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all digital, but make a portable system.

1653
01:55:40,008 --> 01:55:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to...

1654
01:55:41,409 --> 01:55:48,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony better step up, because seriously, right now they're really slacking as far as their system goes, and they're going to lose it really quick.

1655
01:55:50,316 --> 01:55:50,656
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1656
01:55:51,016 --> 01:55:55,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well speaking of the iPhone, Mirror's Edge and Puzzle Agent also came out on the iPhone.

1657
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:57,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were releases earlier this week.

1658
01:55:57,942 --> 01:56:01,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Mirror's Edge was already out on the iPad, but now it's on the iPhone.

1659
01:56:01,945 --> 01:56:06,088
[SPEAKER_09]: On the iPad it was $10, and now it's only going to be $5 on the iPhone.

1660
01:56:06,908 --> 01:56:10,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Telltale is trying out a game release on iPhone.

1661
01:56:10,611 --> 01:56:11,612
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Puzzle Agent.

1662
01:56:11,932 --> 01:56:13,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember this came out on PCs a little bit ago.

1663
01:56:14,695 --> 01:56:19,038
[SPEAKER_09]: That is where Telltale games are about approximately on the other iDevices.

1664
01:56:19,478 --> 01:56:25,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, they're on the App Store and check those out if you are interested in either of those series.

1665
01:56:25,903 --> 01:56:35,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, going back to the more traditional consoles, on the Xbox Live Arcade, King of Fighters Sky Stage is supposed to be hitting the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade on September 15th.

1666
01:56:36,432 --> 01:56:41,196
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be costing $10, 800 Microsoft points or whatever that converts to in yen.

1667
01:56:42,177 --> 01:56:47,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is the one, by the way, where Terry Bogard and Mai are like shooters.

1668
01:56:47,782 --> 01:56:49,383
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1669
01:57:12,043 --> 01:57:34,055
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting that Disney's doing this twice Because Epic Mickey has a collector's edition too But with Tron Evolution For PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 There will be the collector's edition It comes with a toy model light cycle From Sideshow Collectibles A display case for it With a drawer to keep the game in It's $130 So you're paying an extra $70 for this figurine But I gotta say

1670
01:57:37,817 --> 01:57:39,738
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a sweet looking figurine.

1671
01:57:39,838 --> 01:57:43,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a little light bike from the new movie.

1672
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,301
[SPEAKER_09]: If it actually lit up, I might have to do it.

1673
01:57:47,381 --> 01:57:48,282
[SPEAKER_09]: No word on that yet.

1674
01:57:48,442 --> 01:57:52,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just wait and see because they're going to have collectible toys and stuff I'm sure when the Tron stuff comes out.

1675
01:57:52,724 --> 01:57:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: You could probably buy one standalone that would be a lot cooler than that.

1676
01:57:59,426 --> 01:58:00,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Those collector's editions, man.

1677
01:58:00,867 --> 01:58:02,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's a real waste of money.

1678
01:58:02,508 --> 01:58:08,390
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you know the Black Ops one that they have coming out now with that little car that has a camera on it and stuff?

1679
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:12,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things are actually out now as some other device.

1680
01:58:13,131 --> 01:58:22,074
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're really popular in the hacking community because they're so easy to modify to do a bunch of different things like installing Linux and crap on it and stuff.

1681
01:58:22,114 --> 01:58:24,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So it might be a good buy to actually get that.

1682
01:58:24,515 --> 01:58:30,241
[SPEAKER_07]: or if you're smart, you'll just go buy the actual toy that's out now instead of spending the extra money.

1683
01:58:31,915 --> 01:58:36,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Tron is awesome, but any game that's a movie tie-in, eh, not sure if wants.

1684
01:58:36,738 --> 01:58:37,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, this game looks pretty awesome.

1685
01:58:38,019 --> 01:58:43,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, I played it at E3 and it was kinda cool because it was like Prince of Persia, but with Tron graphics.

1686
01:58:43,783 --> 01:58:47,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, apparently it's heavily influenced with Capoeira, like all the fighting is based on Capoeira.

1687
01:58:48,226 --> 01:58:49,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, it was kinda rad.

1688
01:58:50,047 --> 01:58:56,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But Shane was watching me play it, and you know, Shane didn't really see Tron as a kid because I think he was like born the year it came out or something.

1689
01:58:57,473 --> 01:58:59,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, I know, right?

1690
01:58:59,794 --> 01:59:00,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think like,

1691
01:59:01,215 --> 01:59:02,256
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1692
01:59:21,114 --> 01:59:26,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, they have it where, um, you know, the main guy, cause it kinda reminds me a lot of, like, The Force Unleashed, almost.

1693
01:59:27,237 --> 01:59:47,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, he's chasing after these guys on light cycles and stuff, and, um, one of the, uh, recognizers, and, you know, he's chasing after them, and all of a sudden, you know, he kills one of them with the disc on the actual light cycle, and then, uh, they start shooting at him, he jumps up, uh, like, runs along the wall, and then transforms back into the light cycle again.

1694
01:59:47,548 --> 01:59:48,949
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just fuckin' sweet.

1695
01:59:50,089 --> 01:59:57,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta admit, I've been to the movies a couple times lately, and that trailer usually plays, and every time they show the trailer for the new Tron movie, I get a little stiffy.

1696
01:59:59,475 --> 02:00:00,276
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks awesome.

1697
02:00:00,356 --> 02:00:05,199
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to see that in 3D, IMAX, and with those D-Box motion seats.

1698
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do the full shebang.

1699
02:00:07,101 --> 02:00:16,487
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as those tickets go on sale, I'm almost wanting to go to LA just to see it at the official Disney theater, because I'm that crazy excited.

1700
02:00:17,133 --> 02:00:18,494
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1701
02:00:36,347 --> 02:00:38,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Tron world after all

1702
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:08,642
[SPEAKER_09]: and, uh, yeah, it's gonna be this huge event that starts October 8th.

1703
02:01:08,662 --> 02:01:09,722
[SPEAKER_05]: It better have all the games in there.

1704
02:01:10,363 --> 02:01:11,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what pisses me off.

1705
02:01:11,644 --> 02:01:14,125
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a week after I'm gonna be there anyway for Gay Days.

1706
02:01:14,845 --> 02:01:15,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So mad.

1707
02:01:16,066 --> 02:01:16,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitches.

1708
02:01:16,987 --> 02:01:17,987
[SPEAKER_09]: But, that means I have to go back.

1709
02:01:18,888 --> 02:01:19,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go.

1710
02:01:19,388 --> 02:01:22,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's October 8th until, I think, we need to go.

1711
02:01:22,890 --> 02:01:24,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, are we that crazy?

1712
02:01:24,311 --> 02:01:24,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1713
02:01:24,591 --> 02:01:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1714
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:25,372
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going.

1715
02:01:26,132 --> 02:01:34,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So there'll be no show the week the Tron movie comes out because DarkSakura and I are gonna go see it at the official 3D Disney theater in Anaheim.

1716
02:01:35,054 --> 02:01:36,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes we are.

1717
02:01:38,395 --> 02:01:41,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, we're going to travel across country to see a movie in a theater.

1718
02:01:41,917 --> 02:01:45,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're worse than the Twilight fans in some regards.

1719
02:01:45,758 --> 02:01:49,820
[SPEAKER_07]: If only we could do that here and see a movie in a theater.

1720
02:01:51,801 --> 02:01:59,504
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't understand because then when it's over, we can go to the electronica party and then we can ride Space Mountain a million times.

1721
02:01:59,544 --> 02:02:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: They should actually redo Space Mountain as Tron Mountain for the movie.

1722
02:02:02,685 --> 02:02:10,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a rumor that if the Tron thing is really successful and the movie does really well, that the Tomorrowland arcade is going to permanently be Flynn's arcade.

1723
02:02:11,585 --> 02:02:14,047
[SPEAKER_05]: That will make me completely giddy.

1724
02:02:15,048 --> 02:02:16,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the way it should be too.

1725
02:02:16,348 --> 02:02:21,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that the reproduction Flins that they do is going to have all the old games and everything too.

1726
02:02:22,132 --> 02:02:22,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1727
02:02:23,353 --> 02:02:27,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it's the same Flins Arcade that's been at Comic Con and some of that stuff.

1728
02:02:27,556 --> 02:02:28,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been traveling around a little bit.

1729
02:02:29,537 --> 02:02:31,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if this new Tron movie is terrible.

1730
02:02:31,999 --> 02:02:39,164
[SPEAKER_09]: You all need to satisfy what I've built it up in my mind of seeing this as a child and you all need to go see this movie opening day so it does well.

1731
02:02:39,344 --> 02:02:42,185
[SPEAKER_05]: and dude, it's Flynn's the bad guy.

1732
02:02:42,886 --> 02:02:43,686
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I think he is.

1733
02:02:44,266 --> 02:02:44,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is he?

1734
02:02:45,507 --> 02:02:46,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a clone.

1735
02:02:47,487 --> 02:02:48,888
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Clue's the bad guy.

1736
02:02:49,488 --> 02:02:49,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1737
02:02:51,857 --> 02:02:52,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited.

1738
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:56,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Takeo Reyes in our chatroom saying, oh, the marathon's affecting Sky already.

1739
02:02:56,542 --> 02:02:58,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Stiffies, crazy trips to Disneyland.

1740
02:02:58,724 --> 02:02:59,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over.

1741
02:02:59,905 --> 02:03:02,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.orangeonstrater.com Let's see.

1742
02:03:02,267 --> 02:03:02,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman.

1743
02:03:02,928 --> 02:03:04,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Disney's gonna make a live nerd dance party?

1744
02:03:05,531 --> 02:03:06,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they are.

1745
02:03:06,732 --> 02:03:07,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerd dance party.

1746
02:03:07,733 --> 02:03:10,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know if DarkSakura and I are gonna be there, it's an extra nerd dance party.

1747
02:03:11,016 --> 02:03:13,978
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to figure out what day that is and announce our arrival well in advance.

1748
02:03:13,998 --> 02:03:15,278
[SPEAKER_05]: We need sparkly silver clothes.

1749
02:03:15,359 --> 02:03:17,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we need to get some of our LA peeps to gum.

1750
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:21,202
[SPEAKER_09]: We need Marissa to shake her boobies at this.

1751
02:03:21,542 --> 02:03:26,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We need DJ Tyrant to show up and write a story for the website once every six months or so.

1752
02:03:26,765 --> 02:03:28,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Disneyland friends, people who work there.

1753
02:03:29,126 --> 02:03:29,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1754
02:03:29,367 --> 02:03:29,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you.

1755
02:03:30,107 --> 02:03:33,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we need our cast member friends that work there to show up.

1756
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:37,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have other LA listeners, so we're going to figure out what day this is.

1757
02:03:37,692 --> 02:03:39,413
[SPEAKER_09]: And the minute tickets go on sale, we've got to get them.

1758
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:40,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're doing this.

1759
02:03:41,235 --> 02:03:42,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I'm so excited.

1760
02:03:42,536 --> 02:03:44,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Scott can come with you.

1761
02:03:44,617 --> 02:03:45,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott's in LA?

1762
02:03:45,658 --> 02:03:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1763
02:03:45,998 --> 02:03:46,418
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1764
02:03:47,579 --> 02:03:52,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I'm making all these plans while Dan's in the other room probably going, the fuck she is.

1765
02:03:55,185 --> 02:03:57,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, we're going to go see Tron at Disneyland, okay?

1766
02:03:59,606 --> 02:04:01,507
[SPEAKER_05]: He said we have it on air.

1767
02:04:01,747 --> 02:04:02,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take Dan.

1768
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take it.

1769
02:04:03,408 --> 02:04:04,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Put Dan in the car.

1770
02:04:04,489 --> 02:04:05,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's coming with us.

1771
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:07,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1772
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:07,890
[SPEAKER_05]: We ain't working.

1773
02:04:08,451 --> 02:04:08,831
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1774
02:04:10,392 --> 02:04:14,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Spazinator in chat says Sky will try to get Loki to build him a real light cycle.

1775
02:04:14,554 --> 02:04:14,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I just might.

1776
02:04:15,674 --> 02:04:15,954
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1777
02:04:16,054 --> 02:04:17,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how to build motorcycles.

1778
02:04:18,055 --> 02:04:19,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you better learn real quick.

1779
02:04:19,356 --> 02:04:19,636
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1780
02:04:20,617 --> 02:04:22,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on with some other quick stories.

1781
02:04:22,217 --> 02:04:23,198
[SPEAKER_09]: That was supposed to be a quick story.

1782
02:04:23,218 --> 02:04:24,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It ended up taking like 15 minutes.

1783
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:25,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Sakura.

1784
02:04:25,982 --> 02:04:28,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Namco is remaking Arcade Classics.

1785
02:04:29,105 --> 02:04:41,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, coming out for Wii is going to be Namco Museum Megamix, which has different remixed games, like the Galaga Remix, the Pac-Man Rail Shooter thing.

1786
02:04:42,836 --> 02:04:50,862
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also going to be, though, an old-school game called Grobda Remix, which is a shmup-y game, so yay.

1787
02:04:51,003 --> 02:04:53,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, of course, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally-X, Galaga, blah, blah, blah.

1788
02:04:55,473 --> 02:04:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: and then for Sims 3 fans like myself, Barnacle Bay!

1789
02:05:00,135 --> 02:05:01,856
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting on the big pirate bandwagon.

1790
02:05:02,316 --> 02:05:03,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what my theory about this is?

1791
02:05:04,797 --> 02:05:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: They're putting out downloadable content so that you can have you know like it's a whole town of piratey goodness but I think they're really getting the inspiration from all these players that have made their own pirate stuff.

1792
02:05:19,304 --> 02:05:21,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just like, oh we'll do it too.

1793
02:05:22,306 --> 02:05:24,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway it's going to be coming out.

1794
02:05:24,867 --> 02:05:26,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you make Johnny Depp walk the plank?

1795
02:05:26,848 --> 02:05:27,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish.

1796
02:05:28,549 --> 02:05:34,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for people who may be a little bit pissed off with Xbox in September, there's Halo freebies.

1797
02:05:35,153 --> 02:05:35,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1798
02:05:36,434 --> 02:05:43,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the launch of Halo Reach, it's going to be the 14th through 20th will be Invasion Week.

1799
02:05:44,398 --> 02:05:47,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get new gear, exciting content.

1800
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:47,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Help!

1801
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's invading my wallet!

1802
02:05:49,161 --> 02:05:50,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Spectacular prizes!

1803
02:05:50,861 --> 02:05:54,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And a chance to play with creators of the game, and that was a quote.

1804
02:05:54,762 --> 02:06:06,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Xbox Live Gold features to Silver members on September 17th through 20th, and anyone who gets online can download the Invasion theme.

1805
02:06:08,747 --> 02:06:11,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see Master Chiefs running around in party hats.

1806
02:06:12,728 --> 02:06:18,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, as well, Resident Evil 5 Avatar outfits and game add-ons will be discounted.

1807
02:06:18,831 --> 02:06:32,018
[SPEAKER_05]: September 13th, Puzzle Games will be getting the DOTW deal, Best to Move Live, Puzzle Chronicles, Tower Blocks, Deluxer, knocked down to 400 Microsoft points, $5, and Gyromancer is going from $1,200 to $800.

1808
02:06:32,058 --> 02:06:33,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Rock Band 3 Avatar stuff, and...

1809
02:06:42,183 --> 02:06:48,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the Marketplace is Bully Scholarship Edition and Cabela's African Safari, which isn't Africa.

1810
02:06:50,046 --> 02:06:54,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of all this, are we allowed to talk about what Dan's playing in the front room right now?

1811
02:06:54,588 --> 02:06:56,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that like a no-no topic?

1812
02:06:56,989 --> 02:06:57,229
[SPEAKER_09]: No-no?

1813
02:06:57,909 --> 02:06:58,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, no-no.

1814
02:06:58,630 --> 02:06:58,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

1815
02:06:59,230 --> 02:07:01,391
[SPEAKER_09]: This is completely unrelated to what we were just talking about, I promise.

1816
02:07:03,332 --> 02:07:05,152
[SPEAKER_09]: We can talk about it, but I don't know where he got it.

1817
02:07:05,312 --> 02:07:06,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Me neither.

1818
02:07:06,053 --> 02:07:06,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Me neither.

1819
02:07:08,582 --> 02:07:09,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sweet.

1820
02:07:09,383 --> 02:07:11,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're getting more people committing to coming to the electronic.

1821
02:07:11,665 --> 02:07:12,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is going to be awesome.

1822
02:07:13,226 --> 02:07:13,486
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1823
02:07:14,047 --> 02:07:16,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1824
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:19,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have a story you wanted to do, Loki?

1825
02:07:19,952 --> 02:07:20,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.

1826
02:07:20,913 --> 02:07:21,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.

1827
02:07:21,213 --> 02:07:22,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to do Twitter topics.

1828
02:07:22,454 --> 02:07:22,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my gosh.

1829
02:07:22,954 --> 02:07:23,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to forget the tweets.

1830
02:07:24,195 --> 02:07:24,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do Twitter topics.

1831
02:07:25,156 --> 02:07:25,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1832
02:07:26,097 --> 02:07:27,838
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll give you a little more time to think about that story anyway.

1833
02:07:29,299 --> 02:07:33,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet.

1834
02:07:34,001 --> 02:07:36,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We only have a few tonight probably because I said don't send us links.

1835
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:40,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I don't think I don't think Tigerclaw's in chat tonight.

1836
02:07:40,824 --> 02:07:41,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, is he okay?

1837
02:07:43,585 --> 02:07:46,306
[SPEAKER_09]: He probably went on vacation for Labor Day like most people do.

1838
02:07:47,266 --> 02:07:48,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Every night I expect to see links from Tigerclaw.

1839
02:07:48,947 --> 02:07:51,188
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not there tonight.

1840
02:07:51,548 --> 02:07:53,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to send a search party to his home?

1841
02:07:53,168 --> 02:07:55,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is not typical.

1842
02:07:55,449 --> 02:07:57,230
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think he's probably on a trip.

1843
02:07:58,730 --> 02:07:59,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Let loose the hounds.

1844
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:00,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1845
02:08:01,471 --> 02:08:01,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1846
02:08:04,351 --> 02:08:16,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Our good buddy Jay Jugo on Twitter is saying, Breakdown for the win by OLR because they're playing the old school music tonight from our old rotation, which is all the old Bomani music and so forth.

1847
02:08:17,134 --> 02:08:24,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Maren Marvel, speaking of people we may or may not see at the Tron thing, is OLR Marathon Night a horrible night to have a curse?

1848
02:08:25,478 --> 02:08:30,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, what curse, what would be a bad curse to have during the, what would be a bad curse to have during the OLR marathon?

1849
02:08:31,382 --> 02:08:32,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Glittery vampires.

1850
02:08:32,303 --> 02:08:35,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably diarrhea would be a bad curse to have actually during this marathon.

1851
02:08:35,085 --> 02:08:35,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So we better not get pizza.

1852
02:08:35,866 --> 02:08:36,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1853
02:08:41,727 --> 02:08:43,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, more tweets here.

1854
02:08:44,169 --> 02:08:45,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Leo Shen sends us a tweet.

1855
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:50,794
[SPEAKER_09]: BlazeBlue, Continuum Shift 2 announced for arcades and three new characters are on the way.

1856
02:08:51,134 --> 02:08:55,237
[SPEAKER_09]: He does link us to the official website, and I don't think this is a story that even comes up later.

1857
02:08:55,937 --> 02:09:04,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the official website's all in Japanese, so I can't say a whole lot else with this, but for those of you guys that are fans of this series, you played this game, right, Alan?

1858
02:09:04,284 --> 02:09:04,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1859
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:07,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Loki, you might have a little bit too.

1860
02:09:07,302 --> 02:09:12,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the arcade version on my cabinet.

1861
02:09:12,567 --> 02:09:13,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have this in Gamefly one week?

1862
02:09:14,148 --> 02:09:17,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was the very first game I got with Gamefly and I brought it over to your house.

1863
02:09:17,771 --> 02:09:20,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess there's a new one coming out, so that's pretty cool.

1864
02:09:21,176 --> 02:09:28,362
[SPEAKER_09]: TKL Ray sends us a tweet Would y'all be interested in doing the Extra Life Marathon this year?

1865
02:09:28,582 --> 02:09:39,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Donations go to your local CMN hospital, which if I'm not mistaking is Children's Miracle Network, I think I do remember these tweets from last year God, has it been a year already?

1866
02:09:39,612 --> 02:09:49,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so October 16th It depends Didn't we try to do this last year and something happened?

1867
02:09:50,743 --> 02:09:51,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we did.

1868
02:09:51,564 --> 02:09:52,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it just didn't work out.

1869
02:09:52,764 --> 02:09:53,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Something happened.

1870
02:09:53,525 --> 02:09:54,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't work out.

1871
02:09:55,987 --> 02:10:01,851
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can't participate directly, we'll definitely donate at least, but we'll see.

1872
02:10:01,911 --> 02:10:04,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to commit just yet, especially after doing a marathon tonight.

1873
02:10:06,274 --> 02:10:10,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we could do a full, full, full marathon, especially after having just done one tonight.

1874
02:10:10,236 --> 02:10:12,258
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have waited, huh?

1875
02:10:12,338 --> 02:10:12,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

1876
02:10:14,241 --> 02:10:19,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator PSN tweets For those that have a PS3 and care, there's an episode of Campus PD on the PSN store that's temporarily free.

1877
02:10:34,838 --> 02:10:36,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It's under TV shows and free.

1878
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:51,581
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I watch early in the morning.

1879
02:10:51,601 --> 02:10:52,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Drunken sorority chicks?

1880
02:10:53,142 --> 02:11:05,552
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically just cops on... There was an episode of that I watched that they were busting some guys for having pot in a frat house or something like that because they saw it through a window.

1881
02:11:05,912 --> 02:11:08,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they came in and it was just a bunch of...

1882
02:11:09,778 --> 02:11:14,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Hippie college kids complaining that you don't have the right to enter my premises, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1883
02:11:14,579 --> 02:11:15,460
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's in plain sight.

1884
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:16,380
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see it right here.

1885
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:19,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, it gives us probable cause to enter your residence.

1886
02:11:19,921 --> 02:11:22,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So shut the fuck up, Mr. Law Major.

1887
02:11:23,702 --> 02:11:25,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Pot in a frat house?

1888
02:11:25,243 --> 02:11:26,323
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't say.

1889
02:11:26,343 --> 02:11:26,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1890
02:11:26,723 --> 02:11:27,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out.

1891
02:11:27,523 --> 02:11:28,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Get right out of town.

1892
02:11:28,544 --> 02:11:29,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... No.

1893
02:11:31,685 --> 02:11:32,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

1894
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:33,210
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1895
02:11:50,547 --> 02:11:55,393
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've watched Cops in Mardi Gras or whatever, they have that episode or whatever.

1896
02:11:55,413 --> 02:12:02,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Ho Ho Ho, their special episodes with all the prostitutes that they're picking up and stuff.

1897
02:12:03,082 --> 02:12:04,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your top back on, ma'am.

1898
02:12:04,643 --> 02:12:04,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Ma'am.

1899
02:12:05,885 --> 02:12:06,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your shirt back on, ma'am.

1900
02:12:08,087 --> 02:12:08,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Come with me, ma'am.

1901
02:12:09,729 --> 02:12:11,031
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had anything to drink tonight, ma'am.

1902
02:12:12,441 --> 02:12:16,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it's... Yeah, wonderful programming.

1903
02:12:16,802 --> 02:12:19,623
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what they put... Can you believe COPS is still on?

1904
02:12:20,203 --> 02:12:25,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, COPS started, like, when FOX Network started in, like, 87, and it is still on.

1905
02:12:26,005 --> 02:12:28,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that America's Most Wanted, still going.

1906
02:12:28,386 --> 02:12:28,926
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

1907
02:12:28,946 --> 02:12:31,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Is John Walsh still hosting after all these years?

1908
02:12:31,787 --> 02:12:32,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

1909
02:12:32,587 --> 02:12:37,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't they finally find who killed his son, like, just not that long ago, and it turns out the guy died?

1910
02:12:37,609 --> 02:12:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the guy that was already in prison, I think, kept confessing and then recanting it like four times so they couldn't.

1911
02:12:44,836 --> 02:12:46,377
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's probably on his Wikipedia.

1912
02:12:46,758 --> 02:12:47,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, probably.

1913
02:12:48,159 --> 02:12:49,580
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a horrible story, though, what happened.

1914
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:49,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1915
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:51,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he was, it actually involves video games.

1916
02:12:51,562 --> 02:12:53,844
[SPEAKER_09]: He was playing like an Atari 2600 when he got kidnapped, right?

1917
02:12:54,164 --> 02:12:55,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Or something like that, out of Sears or something?

1918
02:12:55,946 --> 02:12:56,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

1919
02:12:56,286 --> 02:12:57,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Or watching other kids play it, I think.

1920
02:12:58,308 --> 02:12:58,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1921
02:12:58,749 --> 02:12:58,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1922
02:12:59,629 --> 02:12:59,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1923
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:01,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't mean to be a downer on the show.

1924
02:13:01,631 --> 02:13:02,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah, wah.

1925
02:13:02,132 --> 02:13:02,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah, wah.

1926
02:13:02,792 --> 02:13:03,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah, wah.

1927
02:13:03,553 --> 02:13:04,714
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it for the Twitter topics.

1928
02:13:05,014 --> 02:13:09,317
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be taking more tweets later on in the evening at twitter.com slash OLR.

1929
02:13:09,437 --> 02:13:11,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be tweeting random stuff and Klingon, by the way.

1930
02:13:11,879 --> 02:13:12,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1931
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:16,282
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says that SalaciousPop does a great state trooper.

1932
02:13:16,843 --> 02:13:17,403
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1933
02:13:19,024 --> 02:13:19,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Ma'am, please.

1934
02:13:20,966 --> 02:13:22,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Ma'am, don't run out into the street, ma'am.

1935
02:13:23,227 --> 02:13:23,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your shirt on.

1936
02:13:24,588 --> 02:13:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Into the car, ma'am.

1937
02:13:25,789 --> 02:13:28,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman in the chat says, Ma'am, please put your shirt back on.

1938
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:29,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, I meant sir.

1939
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:33,361
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 3 and PSP

1940
02:13:50,459 --> 02:13:58,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, I guess, powered by Curiosity, which is not a word, but according to Sony it is.

1941
02:13:59,342 --> 02:14:17,068
[SPEAKER_07]: It is apparently going to be a music service that's cloud-based that'll, at least it'll be coming out in Europe, and subscribers will have access to millions of songs, and then, of course, it's going to be very similar to kind of the Zoom pass that's on, you know, Microsoft's service.

1942
02:14:17,788 --> 02:14:31,005
[SPEAKER_07]: and it says in addition the service will be compatible with Bravia TVs, Blu-ray disc players, home theater systems, and VAIO computers with one single account without the need to manage digital files so you can listen to a bunch of stuff.

1943
02:14:31,706 --> 02:14:35,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So am I correct in assuming this is just more that corporate synergy with Sony Music?

1944
02:14:36,212 --> 02:14:36,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so, yeah.

1945
02:14:36,892 --> 02:14:44,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And so probably a movie thing is... Well, I guess they already have movies on Sony Marketplace, so I guess never mind, but maybe more TV.

1946
02:14:44,876 --> 02:14:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want a piece of the apple pie.

1947
02:14:46,137 --> 02:14:47,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll come in together.

1948
02:14:53,594 --> 02:14:57,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess if they've had movies and TV all this time, I mean, where the hell's the music been?

1949
02:14:58,397 --> 02:15:01,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, they'll have like a game soundtrack or something.

1950
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:04,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, they haven't done a major music store at all.

1951
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:04,601
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for sure.

1952
02:15:04,621 --> 02:15:08,003
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't done anything major on their services.

1953
02:15:09,884 --> 02:15:11,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I don't know.

1954
02:15:12,065 --> 02:15:12,346
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1955
02:15:13,206 --> 02:15:17,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on and talk about going back to the iPhone stuff a little bit.

1956
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:20,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I used to play this game a lot.

1957
02:15:20,714 --> 02:15:21,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Aurora Faint.

1958
02:15:21,915 --> 02:15:24,558
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of a Bejeweled-y type game that they have on the iPhone.

1959
02:15:24,858 --> 02:15:27,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, these guys are really taking these to the next level.

1960
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:28,522
[SPEAKER_09]: They've written their own

1961
02:15:28,982 --> 02:15:30,943
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayTime is this new thing.

1962
02:15:31,383 --> 02:15:33,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a real-time multiplayer game

1963
02:15:57,751 --> 02:16:02,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Playtime will allow real time voice chat during the gameplay across these platforms.

1964
02:16:14,907 --> 02:16:22,074
[SPEAKER_09]: CEO Jason Citrone of Aurora Feint said, quote, Traditionally, multiplayer technology has been accessible only to top-tier developers.

1965
02:16:22,535 --> 02:16:24,536
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just too complicated and time-consuming.

1966
02:16:24,997 --> 02:16:30,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So we invented PlayTime, which literally takes one day to integrate into a casual game.

1967
02:16:31,563 --> 02:16:40,292
[SPEAKER_09]: More information about this, VOIP, lobbies and matchmaking for casual games, expanding to incorporate team-based voice chat, 16-player game servers.

1968
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,480
[SPEAKER_09]: for the core titles.

1969
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:43,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So it definitely sounds like they're trying to build this thing up.

1970
02:16:43,541 --> 02:16:44,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as I know, it doesn't cost money.

1971
02:16:45,302 --> 02:16:46,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing, though.

1972
02:16:46,082 --> 02:16:50,683
[SPEAKER_09]: The games I've noticed on my phone that do support this, it kind of gets in the way.

1973
02:16:51,244 --> 02:16:54,425
[SPEAKER_09]: You only have so much real estate on the iPhone screen.

1974
02:16:54,465 --> 02:17:00,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sort of get annoyed when I try to launch a game and I get this whole register now for open faint.

1975
02:17:01,207 --> 02:17:02,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just like, fuck off.

1976
02:17:02,708 --> 02:17:05,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play my Commodore 64 emulator.

1977
02:17:05,389 --> 02:17:10,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need VOIP to play The Last Ninja on the Commodore 64.

1978
02:17:10,731 --> 02:17:11,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out.

1979
02:17:11,991 --> 02:17:14,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of it is kind of annoying.

1980
02:17:14,712 --> 02:17:16,773
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to tone it down a little bit.

1981
02:17:16,833 --> 02:17:17,853
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice that it's there.

1982
02:17:18,173 --> 02:17:19,494
[SPEAKER_09]: This technology is cool.

1983
02:17:19,614 --> 02:17:21,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great that they're bridging the gap.

1984
02:17:21,635 --> 02:17:23,135
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't throw it in my face.

1985
02:17:23,756 --> 02:17:24,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

1986
02:17:24,756 --> 02:17:27,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Have it a little button in the corner that I can use.

1987
02:17:28,898 --> 02:17:50,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it hides once you do kind of sign in it's just annoying I don't like trying to go into a game for the first time and it's like sign up like Tap Tap Revenge 3 I tried playing for the first time and it's like sign up for Tapulous and connect to your Facebook and like fuck off I just want to tap my screen and time to stuff

1988
02:17:50,974 --> 02:17:52,177
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you looking at over there, DarkSakura?

1989
02:17:52,197 --> 02:17:52,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that that?

1990
02:17:52,657 --> 02:17:53,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic Citadel.

1991
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:55,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the Epic Citadel thing we were talking about earlier?

1992
02:17:55,863 --> 02:17:57,046
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty damn nice.

1993
02:17:57,426 --> 02:17:57,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1994
02:17:59,259 --> 02:18:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll take some screen captures.

1995
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:01,181
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1996
02:18:03,263 --> 02:18:03,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1997
02:18:03,743 --> 02:18:06,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea how to pronounce this.

1998
02:18:06,505 --> 02:18:10,589
[SPEAKER_09]: BetaCNCRA says, I don't care about ads.

1999
02:18:10,649 --> 02:18:11,750
[SPEAKER_09]: They should go die.

2000
02:18:11,870 --> 02:18:12,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Go away ads.

2001
02:18:13,491 --> 02:18:21,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I understand that ads are what it takes to support some free things, but some of these open faint games are things I pay for, and that's where things get really annoying.

2002
02:18:21,518 --> 02:18:22,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just saying.

2003
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:23,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

2004
02:18:24,261 --> 02:18:31,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to chat with us live here at Orange Launch Radio as we tape our super long episode today, Labor Day weekend.

2005
02:18:32,251 --> 02:18:36,096
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you're going to have to put that down and talk about what you've got in gaming news.

2006
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:39,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Like...

2007
02:18:39,821 --> 02:18:41,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, can you give me a chance to finish?

2008
02:18:43,523 --> 02:18:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, American McGee is doing another Alice game, Alice Madness Returns, but it's going to be not over the top, so they're saying.

2009
02:18:56,350 --> 02:19:07,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be adult and mature, but it's definitely going to be an M-rated title, but it's not like they're doing it just to make it an M-rated title.

2010
02:19:08,196 --> 02:19:09,157
[SPEAKER_05]: They want it to be

2011
02:19:11,258 --> 02:19:17,561
[SPEAKER_05]: with the established universe but have it be something more for an adult to grasp.

2012
02:19:18,382 --> 02:19:18,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for kids.

2013
02:19:18,982 --> 02:19:19,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Disney.

2014
02:19:23,885 --> 02:19:27,667
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to make it extra violent, extra gory, extra bloody.

2015
02:19:28,207 --> 02:19:34,050
[SPEAKER_05]: They want the content itself, the subject matter to be where it gets the M rating.

2016
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:35,631
[SPEAKER_05]: If that makes sense.

2017
02:19:38,343 --> 02:19:39,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be fun.

2018
02:19:39,804 --> 02:19:45,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not going to be like over-the-top Mortal Kombat style blood, but they still, you know, Alice is still going to cut things, right?

2019
02:19:46,089 --> 02:19:48,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure if she stabs something, it'll bleed.

2020
02:19:48,511 --> 02:19:50,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Just won't, you know, gush a geyser of blood.

2021
02:19:51,233 --> 02:19:53,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really not sure how to take a news story like that.

2022
02:19:53,294 --> 02:20:01,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they're saying, like, well, we're not trying to go for a mature rating, but our game will have mature content, but it's necessary to the plot.

2023
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:05,884
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like telling an actress, like, your topless scene is integral to the plot.

2024
02:20:05,944 --> 02:20:06,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's...

2025
02:20:06,604 --> 02:20:07,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It always is.

2026
02:20:07,565 --> 02:20:11,948
[SPEAKER_09]: It's artistically important to the story that you're naked in this scene.

2027
02:20:12,448 --> 02:20:14,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Highbrow is what we're going for.

2028
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:14,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

2029
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:16,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Highbrow boobies.

2030
02:20:16,051 --> 02:20:20,915
[SPEAKER_09]: When the killer gets you in the shower, you see you need to be topless because you're in the shower.

2031
02:20:22,056 --> 02:20:28,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about dealing with mental illness or an abusive childhood.

2032
02:20:30,069 --> 02:20:31,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Topless scenes or Alice?

2033
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:34,152
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking about... I agree.

2034
02:20:34,192 --> 02:20:42,778
[SPEAKER_05]: The type of topic, though, considered mature and adult would be something like, the character herself is supposed to be kind of nuts and living a very unhappy life.

2035
02:20:43,558 --> 02:20:44,959
[SPEAKER_03]: In a brothel full of topless women.

2036
02:20:46,661 --> 02:20:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, usually the protagonists in Silent Hill games, once you finally find out what their origin is, it's like, whoa, that's really messed up.

2037
02:20:54,906 --> 02:20:55,807
[SPEAKER_05]: He did what to his wife?

2038
02:20:56,447 --> 02:20:56,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2039
02:20:56,688 --> 02:20:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like the little girl who...

2040
02:20:59,711 --> 02:21:13,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Her special bad guy was the daddy chained to the door with the knife trying to do dirty things Takeo Rei in our chatroom says the 3D boobs in Piranha 3D were very important to its plot It was!

2041
02:21:13,619 --> 02:21:23,184
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a movie I haven't seen yet but I think I need to even though I think a lot of those gore movies are kind of stupid like when it knows it's over the top sometimes they're really funny

2042
02:21:24,315 --> 02:21:26,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you gotta have boobs in there just to show your cheese.

2043
02:21:27,017 --> 02:21:32,059
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I don't understand is that there's actually a version... This was great.

2044
02:21:32,099 --> 02:21:33,120
[SPEAKER_09]: It was in the local paper.

2045
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:35,721
[SPEAKER_09]: They were talking about the local drive-ins and how they're still going.

2046
02:21:36,041 --> 02:21:40,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were showing Piranha at the drive-in, but it's not 3D because you can't do 3D on a drive-in screen.

2047
02:21:41,084 --> 02:21:46,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were interviewing this lady who took her... It had nothing to do with this fact, but it should have.

2048
02:21:46,067 --> 02:21:48,248
[SPEAKER_09]: She took her 6- and 8-year-old to go see Piranha.

2049
02:21:49,308 --> 02:21:49,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2050
02:21:50,749 --> 02:21:55,610
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm not one to tell you what to do with your kids, but at the same time I couldn't help and look at that but go, really?

2051
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:57,530
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bad parenting.

2052
02:21:57,690 --> 02:22:01,891
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to take your six-year-old to go see Piranha and it's not even in 3D.

2053
02:22:02,991 --> 02:22:03,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make it better?

2054
02:22:03,991 --> 02:22:04,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2055
02:22:05,092 --> 02:22:10,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you take them to the lake the next day and then they don't want to go to the lake anymore.

2056
02:22:10,933 --> 02:22:14,713
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, oh, speaking of gore movies, apparently Saw is getting a 3D version.

2057
02:22:14,813 --> 02:22:15,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, do not want.

2058
02:22:16,174 --> 02:22:16,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard that.

2059
02:22:16,814 --> 02:22:17,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not want.

2060
02:22:18,188 --> 02:22:22,732
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I like it when it's over the top, but I don't like it when it tries to be real like Saw does.

2061
02:22:22,752 --> 02:22:23,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to see Machete?

2062
02:22:24,533 --> 02:22:25,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see Machete!

2063
02:22:25,714 --> 02:22:28,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Jarrah Gage in chat says, Machete has fake Lindsay Lohan boobs.

2064
02:22:30,258 --> 02:22:32,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard there was nudity from Lohan in that.

2065
02:22:33,661 --> 02:22:40,166
[SPEAKER_05]: As I described Machete this morning, it's a movie based off a trailer, based off a fake movie.

2066
02:22:42,247 --> 02:22:42,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely want to see it.

2067
02:22:43,305 --> 02:22:43,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Hobo with a Shotgun

2068
02:23:16,346 --> 02:23:17,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

2069
02:23:17,607 --> 02:23:21,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki and me and then the mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.

2070
02:23:22,311 --> 02:23:22,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes.

2071
02:23:24,012 --> 02:23:32,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, of course, the Microsoft summer gaming thing worked out really well for them.

2072
02:23:33,226 --> 02:23:37,051
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to do it again, but this time in the fall.

2073
02:23:37,852 --> 02:23:42,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to call it the Microsoft Xbox Live Arcade Game Feast Promotion.

2074
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:44,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And there will be, of course, a bunch of games coming out.

2075
02:23:44,962 --> 02:23:47,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I guess, starting September 29th.

2076
02:23:48,767 --> 02:23:50,369
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2077
02:24:10,205 --> 02:24:11,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like free.

2078
02:24:11,306 --> 02:24:12,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Free is good.

2079
02:24:13,307 --> 02:24:19,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, also Super Meat Boy will be coming out October 20th to wrap the whole thing up.

2080
02:24:21,154 --> 02:24:22,955
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll also be 1,200 Microsoft points.

2081
02:24:24,556 --> 02:24:30,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, we'll be able to give you guys previews on each of these games soon because I've played most of them already.

2082
02:24:32,362 --> 02:24:34,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about them in coming weeks.

2083
02:24:36,527 --> 02:24:37,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty.

2084
02:24:37,767 --> 02:24:41,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Any of those games you think are worth buying based off of what you played so far?

2085
02:24:41,589 --> 02:24:42,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Comic Jumper was kind of fun.

2086
02:24:42,949 --> 02:24:44,269
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a beat-em-up game.

2087
02:24:44,289 --> 02:24:52,112
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a really neat looking... It's kind of like a comic zone, but HD-ish.

2088
02:24:52,972 --> 02:24:54,412
[SPEAKER_07]: The main character's kind of weird looking, though.

2089
02:24:55,873 --> 02:24:57,213
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks like a Ninja Turtle, almost.

2090
02:24:58,414 --> 02:24:59,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninja Turtle crossed with...

2091
02:25:01,394 --> 02:25:06,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, some sort of Flash Gordon and Deadpool.

2092
02:25:07,278 --> 02:25:08,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Super Meat Boy is supposed to be really good.

2093
02:25:08,839 --> 02:25:10,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just disappointed that it was broken.

2094
02:25:10,841 --> 02:25:14,083
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't stay broken forever.

2095
02:25:14,444 --> 02:25:15,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'll fix it eventually.

2096
02:25:16,605 --> 02:25:18,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And Hydrophobia, I don't know about Hydrophobia.

2097
02:25:19,246 --> 02:25:20,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, price drop!

2098
02:25:20,687 --> 02:25:26,350
[SPEAKER_09]: The DSi and the DSi Extra Large are going to be getting a hiccup at a bad time.

2099
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:30,952
[SPEAKER_09]: In North America, the DSi and DSi Extra Large are getting a price drop.

2100
02:25:30,992 --> 02:25:34,574
[SPEAKER_09]: It's effective September 12th, so not just yet, but real soon.

2101
02:25:35,295 --> 02:25:38,116
[SPEAKER_09]: The handhelds will now be $150 for the DSi and $170 for the DSi XL.

2102
02:25:41,618 --> 02:25:43,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Time to clear out that inventory before the 3DS comes out.

2103
02:26:07,583 --> 02:26:22,336
[SPEAKER_09]: and then the 3DS will come out and I'll have to buy that too so it's a win-win so yay price drops and all that good stuff alright let's move on to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails and you know if we feel like it we'll read them

2104
02:26:24,102 --> 02:26:24,882
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we all, of course.

2105
02:26:24,942 --> 02:26:26,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course we're going to read emails from you guys.

2106
02:26:26,743 --> 02:26:29,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

2107
02:26:30,285 --> 02:26:37,648
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have DarkSakura open up the old mailbag and dive in and pull out a letter right now, but not until I play the music.

2108
02:26:44,531 --> 02:26:49,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we actually got two emails, but I figured maybe in two hours I'll check the mailbox again.

2109
02:26:51,727 --> 02:27:09,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Periodically Hello, OLR I can finally listen live to your show OLR starts at 3am on Monday in Belgium Still, I can't call in tonight I'll wake everyone Show starts at 11pm Anyways, I have a question for Loki

2110
02:27:10,407 --> 02:27:15,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I have all Sega guns, Light Phaser, Menacer, Stunner, Virtua Gun, and the Dreamcast Gun.

2111
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:19,993
[SPEAKER_05]: My problem is that none of these guns, except for the Menacer, work on newer TVs.

2112
02:27:20,513 --> 02:27:25,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I currently don't have room for an old TV, so I was wondering if I could make these guns work on a modern LCD TV.

2113
02:27:26,636 --> 02:27:27,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just go ahead and close the email.

2114
02:27:27,777 --> 02:27:29,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for a weekly OLR, you guys are so awesome.

2115
02:27:30,118 --> 02:27:31,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Cyber Beast, Belgium.

2116
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:33,000
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can't.

2117
02:27:35,688 --> 02:27:47,918
[SPEAKER_07]: That's unfortunate, but you're not going to be able to do that because newer guns that they have out now basically kind of have little light sensor bars or some sort of sensor bar that attaches to the TV that you would use.

2118
02:27:48,199 --> 02:27:49,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Wii style.

2119
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:55,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's like the Wii or even if you want to go even older school like the Power Glove.

2120
02:27:55,785 --> 02:28:02,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically just something because they can't do the refresh stuff on the TVs anymore, so that's

2121
02:28:03,491 --> 02:28:04,532
[SPEAKER_07]: What the solution is now.

2122
02:28:04,612 --> 02:28:08,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So, unfortunately, you're not going to be able to use those on newer TVs.

2123
02:28:09,735 --> 02:28:11,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And that should answer the question.

2124
02:28:12,156 --> 02:28:12,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email.

2125
02:28:13,037 --> 02:28:13,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guys.

2126
02:28:14,097 --> 02:28:15,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Molten Brown here.

2127
02:28:15,898 --> 02:28:16,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

2128
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:20,261
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be chocolate.

2129
02:28:22,121 --> 02:28:26,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just listening to your last show and I wanted to take a shot at figuring out THQ's warped reasoning.

2130
02:28:27,229 --> 02:28:36,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps to THQ, the amount that they sell to their distributors depends on how many people will buy the game new, since the distributors will only buy what they think they will be able to sell.

2131
02:28:37,083 --> 02:28:44,629
[SPEAKER_05]: If the distributors are having a hard time unloading the new game because people are buying it used, then they will decrease the amount of new games they buy from the producers.

2132
02:28:45,010 --> 02:28:49,513
[SPEAKER_05]: This means that in the end, THQ and other producers will get less money since distributors are buying less of their game.

2133
02:28:50,074 --> 02:28:58,000
[SPEAKER_05]: While I don't agree with this reasoning, nor THQ's stance towards used gamers, I can... I'm thinking of used gamers, like the gamers themselves being used.

2134
02:28:59,221 --> 02:29:00,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I can... I feel so used today.

2135
02:29:01,103 --> 02:29:01,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm spent.

2136
02:29:02,364 --> 02:29:03,184
[SPEAKER_09]: By this program.

2137
02:29:04,745 --> 02:29:09,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I can kind of see where they are coming from since they are in the business to make money.

2138
02:29:09,848 --> 02:29:12,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad though it is, that's what it boils down to.

2139
02:29:14,231 --> 02:29:19,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, keep up the good work and hopefully next time I will be awake enough to send a longer email with some questions.

2140
02:29:19,234 --> 02:29:21,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Your dutiful listener, Molten Brown.

2141
02:29:21,295 --> 02:29:23,316
[SPEAKER_05]: The not gross version of Molten Brown.

2142
02:29:24,153 --> 02:29:25,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, I don't think that's the case at all.

2143
02:29:25,874 --> 02:29:27,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's why I don't think that.

2144
02:29:27,854 --> 02:29:32,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the first game that they pulled that on was UFC 2010.

2145
02:29:32,636 --> 02:29:50,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, they wouldn't have announced it to anybody until the day the game was released, except the fact that Destructoid got a hold of, I guess, a source of somebody who purchased the game before the street date and found out that it had this whole thing on there anyways.

2146
02:29:50,101 --> 02:29:52,322
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't going to tell anybody about it until last minute.

2147
02:29:52,682 --> 02:29:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

2148
02:30:11,705 --> 02:30:12,966
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on and so forth.

2149
02:30:37,125 --> 02:30:38,226
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2150
02:30:58,378 --> 02:31:05,044
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't make your online service better within the $60 price point, then you need to raise the price of your games.

2151
02:31:05,124 --> 02:31:11,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether that's popular or not with your consumers, that's the risk you're going to have to take if that's really an issue for you.

2152
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:14,472
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, it doesn't come down to making their service better.

2153
02:31:14,773 --> 02:31:20,858
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I'm aware, the UFC stuff, I don't think they've really done anything to their online service and made it really awesome.

2154
02:31:21,098 --> 02:31:24,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anyone's going, oh my god, the online UFC is so sweet.

2155
02:31:24,221 --> 02:31:26,322
[SPEAKER_07]: This is way better than every other game I've ever played.

2156
02:31:26,683 --> 02:31:30,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's the case at all, and I don't think that's ever going to be the case with this stuff.

2157
02:31:30,386 --> 02:31:36,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just an excuse that they're using to try to justify charging you an extra $10 if you buy the game used.

2158
02:31:37,612 --> 02:31:43,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Breakman in our chatroom says, quite simply, if that's a plan to drive up sales, it's not a very good plan.

2159
02:31:43,917 --> 02:31:45,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, that's what it was, because they...

2160
02:31:46,821 --> 02:32:03,866
[SPEAKER_07]: If that was their intent, was to drive up new sales, because the way it works, it goes either you're going to have your direct consumers or your direct retailers that you're working with, like the GameStops and whatever, or the distributors that they're working with.

2161
02:32:03,926 --> 02:32:08,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So either way, they have customers that need to place orders with those companies.

2162
02:32:09,088 --> 02:32:13,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Then those companies say, okay, we have X number of pieces on order.

2163
02:32:13,329 --> 02:32:14,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how many pieces we think we need.

2164
02:32:15,891 --> 02:32:20,094
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have on order plus a little bit of extra of a pad to sell later on.

2165
02:32:20,595 --> 02:32:22,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what they placed with the actual publisher.

2166
02:32:22,917 --> 02:32:42,314
[SPEAKER_07]: If their intent was on driving up new game sales, then they would have let that news out a lot earlier so that people would go, oh, okay, well then I need to buy a new version of this game instead so that I can get my online content for no additional price, which really doesn't make any sense anyways.

2167
02:32:43,195 --> 02:32:56,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that would be, they would have to do that in order for that to actually be true, but they didn't, and, you know, now they're even talking about raising the price, you know, from five to ten dollars, so...

2168
02:32:58,365 --> 02:32:59,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just a big old cash grab.

2169
02:32:59,685 --> 02:33:00,326
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all it is.

2170
02:33:01,466 --> 02:33:05,347
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point, the video game market is going to crash under the weight of all this.

2171
02:33:05,407 --> 02:33:07,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because they think they need some extra money.

2172
02:33:07,468 --> 02:33:14,650
[SPEAKER_07]: They think that, oh, hey, well, we can make money off of each used sale because these damn used sales, they're cutting into our new game sales.

2173
02:33:14,810 --> 02:33:24,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know if that's the case at all because I think a lot of people that are planning on buying those used games weren't going to buy your game new anyways.

2174
02:33:24,613 --> 02:33:25,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2175
02:33:25,313 --> 02:33:27,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of the fact that you don't have...

2176
02:33:29,562 --> 02:33:31,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, online or online's extra or something like that.

2177
02:33:31,743 --> 02:33:33,284
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they may just say, you know what?

2178
02:33:33,404 --> 02:33:34,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need that game at all.

2179
02:33:35,085 --> 02:33:38,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll be resentful against you and not buy your product going forward.

2180
02:33:39,427 --> 02:33:40,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So it may have a negative impact.

2181
02:33:41,067 --> 02:33:43,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, overall, it's not a really good move.

2182
02:33:43,869 --> 02:33:45,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of people are going to move that direction anyways.

2183
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:47,190
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2184
02:33:48,171 --> 02:33:56,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to, I guess, appropriately following up all this ranting, a segment we do here on the show every week called the FUs of the Week.

2185
02:33:57,015 --> 02:33:57,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Gross.

2186
02:34:13,363 --> 02:34:14,684
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to having to take algebra.

2187
02:34:14,904 --> 02:34:16,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it's a hard class, just that I hate math.

2188
02:34:18,166 --> 02:34:18,446
Loki?

2189
02:34:19,707 --> 02:34:24,710
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to people that drive really slow in front of me or that are lost and don't seem to know where they're going.

2190
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:29,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate people that all of a sudden just cut over a couple lanes because they missed their turn.

2191
02:34:29,533 --> 02:34:29,893
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2192
02:34:29,913 --> 02:34:37,138
[SPEAKER_07]: If you miss your turn, you need to make a U-turn and then correct it that way instead of just going, oh my god, and cutting off everybody.

2193
02:34:39,349 --> 02:34:42,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have a lot of angst, so I'll go with the driver FU too.

2194
02:34:42,337 --> 02:34:45,345
[SPEAKER_09]: FU that SUV that totally cut me off merging onto I-80 today.

2195
02:34:45,566 --> 02:34:46,207
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a bitch.

2196
02:34:47,591 --> 02:34:47,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan?

2197
02:34:50,093 --> 02:34:51,694
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to hot weather, I guess?

2198
02:34:51,834 --> 02:34:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2199
02:34:52,855 --> 02:34:53,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty mellow right now.

2200
02:34:53,715 --> 02:34:54,816
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because you live in Silent Hill.

2201
02:34:55,176 --> 02:34:55,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

2202
02:34:55,276 --> 02:34:56,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's always cold.

2203
02:34:56,217 --> 02:34:56,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2204
02:34:57,578 --> 02:34:58,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not lying.

2205
02:34:58,298 --> 02:35:00,860
[SPEAKER_09]: When you drive up the hill to get to Alan's house, it suddenly gets foggy.

2206
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:02,722
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be the middle of August and it's like fog.

2207
02:35:03,282 --> 02:35:04,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Bradley, how you doing over there?

2208
02:35:04,363 --> 02:35:06,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an F you?

2209
02:35:06,144 --> 02:35:06,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an F you.

2210
02:35:06,564 --> 02:35:09,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have no free time starting Wednesday again for a few months.

2211
02:35:09,767 --> 02:35:10,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Why's that?

2212
02:35:11,108 --> 02:35:12,228
[SPEAKER_01]: My second job starts up again.

2213
02:35:12,749 --> 02:35:13,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good times.

2214
02:35:13,509 --> 02:35:13,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

2215
02:35:14,190 --> 02:35:14,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, good luck.

2216
02:35:16,171 --> 02:35:16,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2217
02:35:16,511 --> 02:35:17,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2218
02:35:18,112 --> 02:35:19,373
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for the FUs of the week.

2219
02:35:20,053 --> 02:35:24,216
[SPEAKER_09]: A few more news stories and then we'll get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2220
02:35:24,236 --> 02:35:27,838
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be the first time tonight we'll be taking calls, but we will take some calls.

2221
02:35:28,518 --> 02:35:31,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Loki, what do you got?

2222
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:35,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Retro City Rampage is a game that they're showing off at PAX right now.

2223
02:35:35,222 --> 02:35:45,488
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a WiiWare game that originally was supposed to be an NES title that was going to be a port of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then something happened where that didn't end up coming out.

2224
02:35:45,908 --> 02:35:57,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 type of game, but it's now just all sorts of references for different 8-bit games are in here.

2225
02:35:57,653 --> 02:36:06,477
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be coming out on WiiWare in December, but I mean they have everything from Contra references to Metal Gear to just...

2226
02:36:06,977 --> 02:36:08,338
[SPEAKER_07]: All sorts of neat gameplay.

2227
02:36:08,838 --> 02:36:10,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It just looks really cool.

2228
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,321
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all done in kind of an 8-bit style.

2229
02:36:12,741 --> 02:36:21,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And once again, actually that was the Grand Theft Auto 3 that ran on the NES is called Project Grand Theft Endo was the original thing.

2230
02:36:23,108 --> 02:36:25,810
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really, really cool.

2231
02:36:27,463 --> 02:36:29,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely worth checking out once it comes out.

2232
02:36:29,204 --> 02:36:33,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it does actually come to Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network as they were saying.

2233
02:36:36,086 --> 02:36:37,167
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks like a sweet game.

2234
02:36:40,008 --> 02:36:41,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually does look really sweet.

2235
02:36:41,269 --> 02:36:43,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I like those games that kind of get in the retro.

2236
02:36:43,449 --> 02:36:47,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I don't know, I wasn't super duper into the Scott Pilgrim game for some reason.

2237
02:36:47,891 --> 02:36:50,992
[SPEAKER_09]: It was okay, but I don't think I played enough of it actually.

2238
02:36:52,173 --> 02:36:53,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

2239
02:36:55,074 --> 02:36:56,415
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be picking this up, though, Loki?

2240
02:36:57,216 --> 02:37:01,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I haven't really played the Wii in a long time, but I definitely... Mine's still not hooked up.

2241
02:37:01,819 --> 02:37:03,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even buy the new Metroid.

2242
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:07,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that might be shocking and awe, but I'm kind of just waiting for it to come out on Xbox 360.

2243
02:37:08,864 --> 02:37:13,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, in my mind, I'm like, it'll come out on the 360 at some point, right?

2244
02:37:13,587 --> 02:37:13,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the PS3?

2245
02:37:15,609 --> 02:37:18,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know, I'm being stupid right now, but yeah, that's it.

2246
02:37:20,217 --> 02:37:23,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ranma's yelling at me saying, you need to play more Scott Pilgrim.

2247
02:37:23,843 --> 02:37:24,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I do.

2248
02:37:25,549 --> 02:37:28,271
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, going on to one more story before the calls, you guys.

2249
02:37:29,192 --> 02:37:32,654
[SPEAKER_09]: The Fast Racing League is something coming out on WiiWare.

2250
02:37:32,714 --> 02:37:34,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Futuristic Fast Racing League.

2251
02:37:35,316 --> 02:37:37,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, what could this be?

2252
02:37:37,678 --> 02:37:42,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Jet Rocket, I guess, is the folks that make the game, or is this?

2253
02:37:42,241 --> 02:37:44,783
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, that's the other game they made.

2254
02:37:44,923 --> 02:37:46,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Shin'en is the name of the company.

2255
02:37:47,765 --> 02:37:50,547
[SPEAKER_09]: They're making this game called Fast Racing League.

2256
02:37:50,627 --> 02:37:53,869
[SPEAKER_09]: All there is is promotion art, but there you go.

2257
02:37:54,930 --> 02:37:59,454
[SPEAKER_09]: My thought when I look at this, though, is that, gee, somebody's making F-Zero for the Wii.

2258
02:37:59,634 --> 02:38:01,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that they're not just calling it F-Zero.

2259
02:38:02,036 --> 02:38:04,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fast, racingly.

2260
02:38:04,438 --> 02:38:05,739
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Wipeout to me.

2261
02:38:06,059 --> 02:38:06,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Super fast.

2262
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:11,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Wipeout's kind of like F-Zero in a way.

2263
02:38:11,444 --> 02:38:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's all the same type of stuff, but, I mean, the vehicle design looks like Wipeout.

2264
02:38:15,467 --> 02:38:19,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though, that they need to be able to play that perfectly is a Nedcon.

2265
02:38:20,631 --> 02:38:21,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

2266
02:38:22,292 --> 02:38:24,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is like playing Wipeout with a Nedcon.

2267
02:38:24,727 --> 02:38:26,128
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2268
02:38:44,637 --> 02:38:47,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight is coming up later during our marathon, so we'll get into that.

2269
02:38:47,739 --> 02:38:50,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless there's any late-breaking news from this morning.

2270
02:38:50,541 --> 02:38:52,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Loki has anything he wants to share from that.

2271
02:38:52,582 --> 02:38:53,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we can do that.

2272
02:38:53,683 --> 02:39:00,427
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, we're just waiting for the calls to come in at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2273
02:39:01,108 --> 02:39:02,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be taking your calls.

2274
02:39:02,248 --> 02:39:07,792
[SPEAKER_09]: This is probably not the first time tonight that the Skype line will be open, but it's open right now.

2275
02:39:08,012 --> 02:39:08,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

2276
02:39:09,413 --> 02:39:11,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Borderlands level cap's going up from 61 to 69.

2277
02:39:11,454 --> 02:39:11,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2278
02:39:11,554 --> 02:39:11,775
[SPEAKER_07]: For free.

2279
02:39:13,996 --> 02:39:15,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Why isn't Borderlands an MMO?

2280
02:39:15,396 --> 02:39:19,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually when I hear about level caps going up, I go, oh, it's like an MMO.

2281
02:39:21,198 --> 02:39:25,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, Borderlands kind of plays like a Warcraft type game, doesn't it?

2282
02:39:25,079 --> 02:39:29,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Except it's like first person, but doesn't it have the whole exclamation marks over people's heads and all that stuff?

2283
02:39:29,921 --> 02:39:31,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Andy, you've played this game a little bit, right, Alan?

2284
02:39:33,413 --> 02:39:37,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Borderlands is pretty much like Diablo if Diablo was a first person shooter.

2285
02:39:38,118 --> 02:39:42,422
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you shoot someone and the number of how much damage you do and hit points appears over their head.

2286
02:39:43,323 --> 02:39:48,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Loot is random, so you gotta go through all the loot that you get and drop the trash.

2287
02:39:48,769 --> 02:39:49,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pretty fun.

2288
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:49,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2289
02:39:50,891 --> 02:39:56,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really glad to hear that Gearbox, makers of Borderlands, got the Duke Nukem Forever contract.

2290
02:39:56,716 --> 02:40:01,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm a huge fan of theirs, because they're the ones... Oh yeah, see, I forgot that they made Borderlands.

2291
02:40:01,681 --> 02:40:06,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, Duke Nukem Forever is going to be fucking awesome then.

2292
02:40:06,621 --> 02:40:13,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they did the Half-Life, Blue Shift, and Half-Life... God, the one with the Marine.

2293
02:40:14,605 --> 02:40:16,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The other expansion, I'm blanking right now.

2294
02:40:16,346 --> 02:40:17,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge Half-Life stan.

2295
02:40:17,567 --> 02:40:22,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that Gearbox does, because they're sort of a part of the Valve family, I'm going to be all for.

2296
02:40:25,157 --> 02:40:26,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas I don't think I've played a lot of their games.

2297
02:40:26,818 --> 02:40:27,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

2298
02:40:27,278 --> 02:40:28,238
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're getting some calls.

2299
02:40:28,258 --> 02:40:30,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the Skype line and see what's up.

2300
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:31,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2301
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:31,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2302
02:40:32,359 --> 02:40:33,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2303
02:40:33,259 --> 02:40:34,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to know, is it happy hour yet?

2304
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:35,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Not yet.

2305
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:36,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still waiting for my drink.

2306
02:40:37,901 --> 02:40:40,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I was supposed to get an hour and a half ago, but that's okay.

2307
02:40:40,642 --> 02:40:41,082
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

2308
02:40:41,102 --> 02:40:41,882
[SPEAKER_10]: You're still waiting?

2309
02:40:41,982 --> 02:40:42,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I already started.

2310
02:40:43,162 --> 02:40:43,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you?

2311
02:40:43,602 --> 02:40:45,383
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the drink of choice for you right now, Ranma?

2312
02:40:46,551 --> 02:40:50,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I have to grill tomorrow, I've been doing nothing but rum and Pepsi all night.

2313
02:40:50,895 --> 02:40:52,436
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to grill tomorrow?

2314
02:40:52,456 --> 02:40:54,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know you were a chef.

2315
02:40:54,177 --> 02:40:56,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you worked at a retail store.

2316
02:40:57,560 --> 02:41:00,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't worked retail in about three, four months.

2317
02:41:00,782 --> 02:41:01,863
[SPEAKER_10]: You're at a restaurant now?

2318
02:41:02,915 --> 02:41:04,256
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm talking about tomorrow.

2319
02:41:04,336 --> 02:41:05,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm breaking out my grill.

2320
02:41:06,036 --> 02:41:07,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Labor Day Barbecue.

2321
02:41:07,417 --> 02:41:08,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2322
02:41:09,378 --> 02:41:09,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just slow.

2323
02:41:10,018 --> 02:41:10,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Dan.

2324
02:41:10,478 --> 02:41:11,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Dan just walked into studio.

2325
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:12,479
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Dan?

2326
02:41:13,519 --> 02:41:14,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.

2327
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:14,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

2328
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be joining us for more of the marathon later on this evening as we move on and take over your house for a night?

2329
02:41:19,261 --> 02:41:20,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have much of a choice.

2330
02:41:21,622 --> 02:41:22,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2331
02:41:22,123 --> 02:41:22,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds great.

2332
02:41:23,365 --> 02:41:23,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes!

2333
02:41:24,005 --> 02:41:27,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so what types of games should we play a little bit during the marathon tonight?

2334
02:41:27,266 --> 02:41:31,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Because at some point I think we're going to move into the vault, I don't know, or out in the living room, I don't know what DarkSakura has planned.

2335
02:41:31,668 --> 02:41:32,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I told Dan to hook up Saturn for me.

2336
02:41:33,169 --> 02:41:33,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2337
02:41:33,769 --> 02:41:34,629
[SPEAKER_09]: The Saturn's hooked up!

2338
02:41:35,269 --> 02:41:35,489
Woo!

2339
02:41:35,730 --> 02:41:36,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the vault!

2340
02:41:36,710 --> 02:41:38,291
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you going to play on the Saturn?

2341
02:41:38,311 --> 02:41:38,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Big TV!

2342
02:41:39,671 --> 02:41:40,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

2343
02:41:40,771 --> 02:41:42,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing Xbox on the big TV.

2344
02:41:43,172 --> 02:41:44,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I gotta get back to the call.

2345
02:41:44,293 --> 02:41:45,233
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk more with Dan later.

2346
02:41:45,373 --> 02:41:45,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

2347
02:41:45,613 --> 02:41:46,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay black!

2348
02:41:46,594 --> 02:41:47,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sounds good.

2349
02:41:47,574 --> 02:41:50,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god.

2350
02:41:52,113 --> 02:41:53,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, last week's show was interesting.

2351
02:41:54,294 --> 02:42:00,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, so what's on your mind today, Ranma, besides the whole happy hour?

2352
02:42:01,778 --> 02:42:04,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually a little bit pissed at some of the people today.

2353
02:42:04,540 --> 02:42:08,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really pissed at people that are bitching about the $10 price increase on Xbox Live.

2354
02:42:08,962 --> 02:42:09,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you mad at them?

2355
02:42:11,704 --> 02:42:14,907
[SPEAKER_10]: You're only paying $60 a year for this.

2356
02:42:15,467 --> 02:42:17,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand why the price is going up.

2357
02:42:18,349 --> 02:42:22,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft is actually putting the money into the infrastructure for improvements.

2358
02:42:22,533 --> 02:42:25,375
[SPEAKER_10]: In order to make those improvements, something has to go up.

2359
02:42:26,116 --> 02:42:33,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Unlike these other software companies who are trying to jack extra money out of us because of used games, they can kiss my ass for all I care, but that's besides the point.

2360
02:42:35,390 --> 02:42:42,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to say, it feels like we're getting nickeled and dimed in every possible place here.

2361
02:42:42,139 --> 02:42:48,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, I'm okay with Microsoft raising the price because they haven't in so long and they've been supporting it fairly decently.

2362
02:42:48,587 --> 02:42:52,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But then when I hear this online pass stuff is being allowed too, I get irritated.

2363
02:42:53,066 --> 02:42:54,707
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

2364
02:42:54,727 --> 02:42:55,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2365
02:42:55,448 --> 02:43:00,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And if people are complaining about it, like you said, buy the cards now or do what I do.

2366
02:43:01,393 --> 02:43:02,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Join Reward Zone.

2367
02:43:02,834 --> 02:43:03,975
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a gamers club.

2368
02:43:04,015 --> 02:43:04,956
[SPEAKER_10]: You buy games.

2369
02:43:05,176 --> 02:43:05,997
[SPEAKER_10]: You get points.

2370
02:43:06,277 --> 02:43:09,500
[SPEAKER_10]: When you hit $150, you get a $10 gift card.

2371
02:43:09,940 --> 02:43:12,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Use that toward your live.

2372
02:43:12,122 --> 02:43:13,523
[SPEAKER_10]: You save $10 that way.

2373
02:43:14,584 --> 02:43:19,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So try to find different ways to exploit reward systems and point cards and all that good stuff, right?

2374
02:43:19,941 --> 02:43:20,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2375
02:43:20,401 --> 02:43:23,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, Microsoft does do a buck a month deals.

2376
02:43:23,343 --> 02:43:24,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Those have popped up.

2377
02:43:24,924 --> 02:43:25,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's true, huh?

2378
02:43:25,884 --> 02:43:26,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've seen those.

2379
02:43:26,684 --> 02:43:26,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2380
02:43:27,685 --> 02:43:31,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw it pop up on my dashboard on April Fool's and I tweeted about it.

2381
02:43:31,687 --> 02:43:34,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone thought I was lying about it.

2382
02:43:34,468 --> 02:43:35,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, no, this is legit.

2383
02:43:36,069 --> 02:43:37,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a screen cap.

2384
02:43:37,710 --> 02:43:39,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting question from Derek H. in our chat room.

2385
02:43:39,931 --> 02:43:44,693
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the odds that when Reach comes out there will be problems connecting because Xbox Live is overloaded?

2386
02:43:45,534 --> 02:43:47,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'll see just how good their infrastructure is, right?

2387
02:43:48,954 --> 02:43:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen it go down yet, you know, so I don't think there will be much of an issue.

2388
02:43:53,499 --> 02:43:55,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think if it ever has gone down.

2389
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:58,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Has Xbox Live ever gone down in a non-preplanned way?

2390
02:43:58,443 --> 02:43:59,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it has for a little bit.

2391
02:43:59,725 --> 02:44:00,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was a few times.

2392
02:44:00,906 --> 02:44:02,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Never like anything too epic, right?

2393
02:44:03,568 --> 02:44:05,150
[SPEAKER_09]: It was always at weird times, too, wasn't it?

2394
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:07,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like around New Year's or something.

2395
02:44:07,291 --> 02:44:09,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this year it was having issues.

2396
02:44:10,252 --> 02:44:11,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be interested to see though.

2397
02:44:11,472 --> 02:44:12,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Derek has a point.

2398
02:44:13,233 --> 02:44:20,856
[SPEAKER_09]: If it goes down, then this whole fact that they're charging the extra money to improve their infrastructure is kind of a line, isn't it?

2399
02:44:21,216 --> 02:44:21,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

2400
02:44:21,617 --> 02:44:28,159
[SPEAKER_07]: If it goes down, that would suck because you're really not going to be adding too many people to the actual live service.

2401
02:44:28,179 --> 02:44:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to have people playing a different game.

2402
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:32,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And Derek says it happened with Halo 3 and Halo 2.

2403
02:44:33,341 --> 02:44:43,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember it happening with Halo 3, but then again not to sound like that guy, but I had it a couple days early so I was playing it a little bit earlier so maybe I didn't notice it.

2404
02:44:44,575 --> 02:44:48,139
[SPEAKER_09]: But sometimes they try to do outages in advance to plan for this stuff, but...

2405
02:44:49,281 --> 02:44:55,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I do remember a couple of times Major Nelson has said there's been issues with live and within an hour or two everything is back to normal.

2406
02:44:57,590 --> 02:45:02,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they know they're going to have to get hell with all these people paying for it.

2407
02:45:03,136 --> 02:45:08,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the PlayStation, if stuff goes down for them, it's free anyway, right?

2408
02:45:10,476 --> 02:45:16,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there was a few times on 1 vs. 100 where they had problems with that.

2409
02:45:17,419 --> 02:45:17,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

2410
02:45:17,879 --> 02:45:31,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it was kind of weird that it was doing that, because in their beta seasons they had like 150,000 at one time, and it was working fine probably back then, but it was like 50,000 that was coming in per time, and it didn't work for like two weeks.

2411
02:45:31,483 --> 02:45:32,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2412
02:45:32,183 --> 02:45:32,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember that.

2413
02:45:32,964 --> 02:45:36,206
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, I was kind of one of those people that played it more when it first came out.

2414
02:45:36,246 --> 02:45:39,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And then later on, I was like, oh, it'll always be here.

2415
02:45:39,127 --> 02:45:40,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just play it next time.

2416
02:45:40,168 --> 02:45:41,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, oh, now it's gone.

2417
02:45:41,569 --> 02:45:42,129
[SPEAKER_09]: No more of that.

2418
02:45:42,829 --> 02:45:43,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget that.

2419
02:45:43,730 --> 02:45:44,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

2420
02:45:44,930 --> 02:45:49,333
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I'd hope with this extra $10 is they'd add something that's like that to replace it.

2421
02:45:49,673 --> 02:45:51,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured we had to have that at least once during the marathon.

2422
02:45:51,934 --> 02:45:52,334
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2423
02:46:20,668 --> 02:46:38,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I've decided that I am so sick of DarkSakura always having her stupid Vuvuzela button here on the program that what I've decided to do is that I've actually decided to counter DarkSakura a little bit here and I actually have my stadium Vuvuzela noise.

2424
02:46:40,714 --> 02:46:41,634
[SPEAKER_05]: You are such a dork.

2425
02:46:41,714 --> 02:46:43,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can have dueling Vuvuzelas on the show.

2426
02:46:45,435 --> 02:46:46,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be amazing.

2427
02:46:46,655 --> 02:46:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do that, Rob.

2428
02:46:47,715 --> 02:46:47,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

2429
02:46:48,016 --> 02:46:49,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the listeners are so excited.

2430
02:46:51,754 --> 02:46:52,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I am glad.

2431
02:46:52,494 --> 02:46:54,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad conventions have banned that thing.

2432
02:46:58,176 --> 02:46:58,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn off.

2433
02:46:59,136 --> 02:46:59,736
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

2434
02:47:00,417 --> 02:47:00,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't shut up.

2435
02:47:02,197 --> 02:47:04,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with us for now?

2436
02:47:04,478 --> 02:47:06,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you'll call in later, but, you know.

2437
02:47:06,398 --> 02:47:07,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have another story.

2438
02:47:08,039 --> 02:47:09,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I can say that when I call back later.

2439
02:47:09,939 --> 02:47:15,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we're supposed to be doing an outbound call right now, so I'm going to let you go for now, but call in later and give us that story.

2440
02:47:15,701 --> 02:47:18,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we do still have more stories, too, that we're going to talk about a little later.

2441
02:47:19,122 --> 02:47:19,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.

2442
02:47:19,822 --> 02:47:20,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

2443
02:47:20,794 --> 02:47:21,215
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2444
02:47:33,075 --> 02:48:02,735
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah we're three hours in and usually at this time there's another man live at All Games Radio and some people might be tuning in to try and hear him but you can't he's not live tonight the man is Bobby Blackwolf the host of the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio and he's not live tonight because he's at Dragon Con this weekend so sorry fans of Bobby who don't listen to us you don't get Bobby tonight or do you we're going to call him right now actually and try to get him on the show

2445
02:48:03,715 --> 02:48:05,616
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can have a mini Bobby Blackwolf show.

2446
02:48:06,036 --> 02:48:07,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So, two ringy dingies.

2447
02:48:13,119 --> 02:48:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Bobby, how are you doing?

2448
02:48:14,739 --> 02:48:16,540
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your buddy Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.

2449
02:48:17,864 --> 02:48:20,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I'm doing great, how are you guys holding up?

2450
02:48:20,566 --> 02:48:21,626
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what, hour three?

2451
02:48:21,947 --> 02:48:23,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's on a schedule, it may cut you off later, I don't know

2452
02:48:41,699 --> 02:48:43,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh great, just what we needed.

2453
02:48:44,660 --> 02:48:46,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows how long the marathon will be going tonight.

2454
02:48:47,382 --> 02:48:50,283
[SPEAKER_09]: When All Games Radio decides to cut it off, we'll be done, I guess.

2455
02:48:50,363 --> 02:48:51,063
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens.

2456
02:48:51,363 --> 02:48:56,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to tweet Channel Z. We'll see what you can do for that.

2457
02:48:56,566 --> 02:49:05,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I figured since you're not able to do a show here live at All Games Radio because A, you're gone, and B, we took over, I thought maybe you'd want to do the mini Bobby Blackwolf show?

2458
02:49:07,661 --> 02:49:14,965
[SPEAKER_12]: I can talk about what's been going on here at DragonCon and some of the neat stuff that I've done and something that we're actually going to be running next week.

2459
02:49:16,026 --> 02:49:16,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2460
02:49:17,267 --> 02:49:17,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, hold on.

2461
02:49:17,647 --> 02:49:18,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even know.

2462
02:49:18,768 --> 02:49:19,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

2463
02:49:19,028 --> 02:49:21,589
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very important breaking news here at the OLR Marathon.

2464
02:49:21,689 --> 02:49:23,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I've been given a glass of liquor.

2465
02:49:23,489 --> 02:49:23,990
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

2466
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:25,510
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my first booze of the evening.

2467
02:49:25,690 --> 02:49:26,090
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

2468
02:49:26,330 --> 02:49:30,592
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a double shot of tequila and... It better be Patron.

2469
02:49:30,852 --> 02:49:31,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

2470
02:49:31,532 --> 02:49:32,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay.

2471
02:49:32,413 --> 02:49:33,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good, good.

2472
02:49:34,593 --> 02:49:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate cheap tequila.

2473
02:49:36,134 --> 02:49:36,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Sid, why?

2474
02:49:36,874 --> 02:49:38,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a peak grapefruit juice.

2475
02:49:40,456 --> 02:49:41,456
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a tasty beverage.

2476
02:49:41,996 --> 02:49:42,236
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2477
02:49:42,556 --> 02:49:43,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making more.

2478
02:49:43,077 --> 02:49:43,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants one?

2479
02:49:43,677 --> 02:49:44,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Bobby.

2480
02:49:45,117 --> 02:49:45,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm making more.

2481
02:49:45,538 --> 02:49:45,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I just...

2482
02:49:47,130 --> 02:49:48,130
[SPEAKER_12]: There's beverages here.

2483
02:49:48,210 --> 02:49:48,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't worry.

2484
02:49:48,671 --> 02:49:49,471
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't feel left out.

2485
02:49:49,631 --> 02:49:55,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to say, you sound like you're either kind of tired or maybe you've had a beverage or two yourself.

2486
02:49:55,413 --> 02:49:56,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2487
02:49:57,033 --> 02:49:58,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually haven't had a beverage today.

2488
02:49:59,474 --> 02:50:01,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I found a quiet place kind of to be.

2489
02:50:02,111 --> 02:50:06,033
[SPEAKER_12]: and then I realized this quiet place is right next to security operations for the hotel.

2490
02:50:06,853 --> 02:50:09,114
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm kind of trying to keep it down a little bit.

2491
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:09,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, I see.

2492
02:50:09,995 --> 02:50:10,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2493
02:50:10,455 --> 02:50:10,695
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2494
02:50:10,955 --> 02:50:12,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what's going on at DragonCon?

2495
02:50:12,556 --> 02:50:17,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you want to tell us a little bit about what's going on over there at the show and some of the stuff you've got for your own show next week.

2496
02:50:18,259 --> 02:50:26,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, basically, I mean, DragonCon, it's a big, it's, you know, take ComicCon and take out really a lot of, like, the industry stuff.

2497
02:50:26,262 --> 02:50:27,503
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a fan convention.

2498
02:50:28,163 --> 02:50:29,604
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of celebrities here.

2499
02:50:30,689 --> 02:50:33,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't stood in line for any of those panels or anything.

2500
02:50:33,551 --> 02:50:37,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I've actually been here staying away from video games, staying away from computers.

2501
02:50:38,396 --> 02:50:46,823
[SPEAKER_12]: The game I've actually been playing most recently, I don't know if you've ever played this game, it's a card-slash-role-playing game called Are You a Werewolf?

2502
02:50:46,884 --> 02:50:47,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you ever played that?

2503
02:50:48,165 --> 02:50:49,566
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but it sounds interesting.

2504
02:50:50,187 --> 02:50:51,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, are you a werewolf?

2505
02:50:52,188 --> 02:50:53,990
[SPEAKER_12]: It goes by another name.

2506
02:50:54,010 --> 02:50:55,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people know it as Mafia.

2507
02:50:55,111 --> 02:50:55,852
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same rules.

2508
02:50:56,803 --> 02:50:58,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, wait, I have played a game like this.

2509
02:50:59,966 --> 02:51:02,128
[SPEAKER_09]: No, when I played it, it was just called Werewolf.

2510
02:51:02,168 --> 02:51:03,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very popular forum game, right?

2511
02:51:03,809 --> 02:51:07,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the thing where, like, you have a group of 12 people, right?

2512
02:51:07,232 --> 02:51:08,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, three of them are wolves.

2513
02:51:09,094 --> 02:51:13,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, every night, everybody votes to lynch one person.

2514
02:51:13,657 --> 02:51:16,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the wolves are the last people standing, they win.

2515
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:17,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2516
02:51:17,440 --> 02:51:17,841
[SPEAKER_09]: They win.

2517
02:51:18,021 --> 02:51:21,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I've seen this game played before.

2518
02:51:21,644 --> 02:51:22,645
[SPEAKER_12]: That's from 2 a.m.

2519
02:51:22,665 --> 02:51:22,985
[SPEAKER_12]: to 9 a.m.

2520
02:51:23,065 --> 02:51:23,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2521
02:51:23,846 --> 02:51:24,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2522
02:51:24,744 --> 02:51:53,831
[SPEAKER_12]: and then I sleep a little bit and about 1 o'clock I get up and go to the dealer's room and stuff like that so that's really what I've been doing staying away from video games there is a video game room here they do have consoles here that people can check out games use games from the game store that's running it from Tennessee but really it's not really the focus of DragonCon there are no game companies exhibiting here so there's not that much video game type stuff going on here

2523
02:51:54,502 --> 02:52:01,547
[SPEAKER_12]: However, and this is the cool thing, I just got an interview, which we're going to run on my show next week, which, by the way, guys, is 25 minutes long.

2524
02:52:01,948 --> 02:52:02,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo-hoo.

2525
02:52:02,948 --> 02:52:07,532
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you remember, did you ever remember, in Dave and Buster's, the Battletech Centers?

2526
02:52:08,192 --> 02:52:08,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

2527
02:52:08,973 --> 02:52:10,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan absolutely loved that thing.

2528
02:52:10,174 --> 02:52:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Virtual World.

2529
02:52:10,814 --> 02:52:12,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was pissed when it was taken out.

2530
02:52:14,277 --> 02:52:18,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the entire story on why it was taken out and where all those pods went.

2531
02:52:19,101 --> 02:52:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

2532
02:52:19,301 --> 02:52:22,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there are eight Battletech pods downstairs, 24 hours.

2533
02:52:23,925 --> 02:52:24,965
[SPEAKER_12]: right here at DragonCon.

2534
02:52:25,866 --> 02:52:26,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

2535
02:52:26,726 --> 02:52:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2536
02:52:27,646 --> 02:52:29,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And they are still making updates.

2537
02:52:29,627 --> 02:52:32,568
[SPEAKER_12]: The game actually looks a lot like MechWarrior 4 on the PC now.

2538
02:52:32,968 --> 02:52:35,809
[SPEAKER_12]: They're actually, the software company is still working on new updates.

2539
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:39,151
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to bring back Red Planet very soon as well.

2540
02:52:40,451 --> 02:52:48,974
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got the story of, you know, where they travel and, you know, because basically Enthusiast bought all the pods after Dave and Buster's canceled the contract.

2541
02:52:49,355 --> 02:52:50,335
[SPEAKER_12]: And the short story is

2542
02:52:50,717 --> 02:52:54,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave and Buster's decided that they no longer wanted to have anybody working the Midway.

2543
02:52:54,999 --> 02:53:10,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything had to be self-sustaining and so the Battletech they decided did not renew the contract with Virtual World so they were going to sell all the pods and all these enthusiasts came together and said we'll buy this set and this set and now all the sets are all over the country and some of them are mobile now.

2544
02:53:11,127 --> 02:53:11,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2545
02:53:12,267 --> 02:53:12,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

2546
02:53:12,848 --> 02:53:17,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I have a 25-minute interview with an owner of a set of 16 pods

2547
02:53:20,229 --> 02:53:44,652
[SPEAKER_12]: 8 of which are traveling 8 of which are in a center in Houston and we talk about you know because he was just a player and they got the funds together to buy it and they travel the country with these pods and they do maintenance on the hardware and they do the community thing and do the whole Battletech Center stuff so they're keeping the Battletech dream alive and we're going to have a long nice very good interview with him next week on the Bobby Blackwell Show

2548
02:53:45,307 --> 02:53:46,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to hear it

2549
02:54:00,083 --> 02:54:00,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave & Buster's Jr.

2550
02:54:18,820 --> 02:54:20,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's going to be an awesome interview, Bobby.

2551
02:54:20,721 --> 02:54:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking forward to that next week.

2552
02:54:22,321 --> 02:54:24,201
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is going on at DragonCon?

2553
02:54:24,422 --> 02:54:26,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you end up on a panel after all, I heard?

2554
02:54:26,402 --> 02:54:26,802
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this?

2555
02:54:27,722 --> 02:54:28,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

2556
02:54:28,643 --> 02:54:34,784
[SPEAKER_12]: The panel they had put me on was the kickoff panel, which was Friday at 1 o'clock, and I actually had to work until noon.

2557
02:54:35,224 --> 02:54:35,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.

2558
02:54:35,765 --> 02:54:43,387
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was all packed and everything, and I left at noon to get down here, and the trains were held up a little bit.

2559
02:54:43,987 --> 02:54:48,128
[SPEAKER_12]: So I actually walked into the back of the panel at 1.15, and the place is packed.

2560
02:54:49,252 --> 02:54:50,653
[SPEAKER_12]: They do call me up at about 1.15, 1.20.

2561
02:54:50,973 --> 02:54:56,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't even gotten my badge yet because the badge line is five hours long for pre-registration.

2562
02:54:56,936 --> 02:55:00,638
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the one thing DragonCon hasn't figured out is how to pick up your badge.

2563
02:55:02,199 --> 02:55:06,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I went up, did the panel, did the last 30 minutes panel.

2564
02:55:06,221 --> 02:55:07,102
[SPEAKER_12]: The room was packed.

2565
02:55:07,142 --> 02:55:09,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like to know why the room was packed?

2566
02:55:09,763 --> 02:55:09,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

2567
02:55:10,543 --> 02:55:11,284
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't for me.

2568
02:55:12,608 --> 02:55:13,288
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the key.

2569
02:55:13,348 --> 02:55:16,870
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ever want to have a packed panel, have Veronica Belmont on it with you.

2570
02:55:18,610 --> 02:55:18,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2571
02:55:19,491 --> 02:55:20,351
[SPEAKER_09]: So she was there, huh?

2572
02:55:20,371 --> 02:55:24,312
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because she was there with the Swords and Lasers podcast.

2573
02:55:24,392 --> 02:55:26,473
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of the one that's her independent podcast.

2574
02:55:27,273 --> 02:55:27,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're here.

2575
02:55:27,914 --> 02:55:31,875
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually did a live show in a large ballroom today at 4 here.

2576
02:55:32,555 --> 02:55:34,196
[SPEAKER_12]: But she was on the panel and stuff.

2577
02:55:34,256 --> 02:55:39,618
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I talked a little bit about what we do at all games and stuff like that.

2578
02:55:40,269 --> 02:55:53,449
[SPEAKER_12]: but yeah the place was packed and it's because Veronica was there and like when it was over everybody was rushing to get their pictures with Veronica and all that stuff so I did get to speak on one panel but that was it so my official obligations were done at 2 and I didn't even have my badge yet at the time

2579
02:55:53,869 --> 02:56:01,031
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the few podcasts that I will admit to listening to, because it is pretty good, is The Instance, which is one of the World of Warcraft podcasts that's out there.

2580
02:56:01,151 --> 02:56:06,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was actually on, they recently had a big Buku, yay, hippie, hurrah, 200th episode.

2581
02:56:07,253 --> 02:56:08,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And she was on that.

2582
02:56:08,853 --> 02:56:12,014
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was kind of like, oh, yeah, this is kind of interesting.

2583
02:56:12,474 --> 02:56:13,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

2584
02:56:13,975 --> 02:56:14,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, cool.

2585
02:56:14,435 --> 02:56:16,315
[SPEAKER_12]: She does a lot of independent stuff.

2586
02:56:16,355 --> 02:56:18,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yeah, she's been hired by CNET.

2587
02:56:18,716 --> 02:56:22,517
[SPEAKER_12]: She works for Core, but she still really loves doing all the independent stuff.

2588
02:56:23,297 --> 02:56:24,437
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.

2589
02:56:24,517 --> 02:56:26,838
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good way to do it.

2590
02:56:26,898 --> 02:56:27,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for her.

2591
02:56:28,758 --> 02:56:35,300
[SPEAKER_09]: What about, like, are there any other type of record-breaking things going on there, like no Thriller dances this year, or what's going on?

2592
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:38,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they can't do Thriller because the Thriller record's currently 12,000.

2593
02:56:40,942 --> 02:56:44,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Mexico City set it to 12,000, so the 900, whatever they did here.

2594
02:56:45,003 --> 02:56:49,564
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how they did, well, I mean, obviously, we won't know how they did until Guinness verifies it, but they did a

2595
02:56:50,171 --> 02:57:19,658
[SPEAKER_12]: they did two existing records and they tried to set up a brand new record the two existing they wanted the most Star Trek characters in one place and the most superheroes in one place and then they created a new one of most steampunk characters in one place because steampunk's really kind of the new goth here at DragonCon everybody is steampunk and Gears and all that stuff so it used to be just Neo-Victorian and then they added all the technology to it so those are the records that they've been trying to break

2596
02:57:20,603 --> 02:57:22,544
[SPEAKER_12]: but I don't know exactly how those have been going.

2597
02:57:23,925 --> 02:57:24,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like fun though.

2598
02:57:24,926 --> 02:57:25,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

2599
02:57:26,307 --> 02:57:29,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I will say I did go in the dealer's room.

2600
02:57:29,449 --> 02:57:39,695
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a dealer that actually had a lot of, going back to the video game thing, a lot of rare Nintendo games, Super Nintendo games, things like that.

2601
02:57:40,695 --> 02:57:43,617
[SPEAKER_12]: He actually had Earthbound for the NES.

2602
02:57:44,357 --> 02:57:45,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow.

2603
02:57:45,438 --> 02:57:47,799
[SPEAKER_09]: He was selling it for $130,000

2604
02:57:49,925 --> 02:57:52,747
[SPEAKER_12]: and I did not get it in time.

2605
02:57:52,807 --> 02:57:54,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I came back ready to get it and somebody else had bought it.

2606
02:57:56,250 --> 02:57:57,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's awful.

2607
02:57:58,231 --> 02:58:02,795
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was the actual limited edition NES release of Earthbound.

2608
02:58:03,495 --> 02:58:05,697
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got Little Samson.

2609
02:58:05,737 --> 02:58:07,978
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got an NES core test cartridge.

2610
02:58:09,239 --> 02:58:16,805
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the test cartridges that the service centers had and he's got that for $3.50 which is a lot more than it ever goes on eBay but it's very, very rare.

2611
02:58:18,247 --> 02:58:43,855
[SPEAKER_12]: but I did buy something from him Nintendo related and it's not exactly rare and you know once people see exactly what it is it's not going to sound as cool as it would when you first see it but I'm going to save that for Friday night on Friday Night Gaming oh a little tease there alright so Friday Night Gaming if you want to check that out this Friday at fnglive.net right?

2612
02:58:44,898 --> 02:58:48,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and the main game we'll be playing is Metroid Other M. Because it's effing live.

2613
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:52,162
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'll be showing this game that I picked up here at DragonCon for a pretty penny.

2614
02:58:52,182 --> 02:58:55,504
[SPEAKER_12]: And I overpaid a little bit, as you can expect, for con prices and stuff.

2615
02:58:55,524 --> 02:58:59,046
[SPEAKER_12]: I looked online how much it is, and I could have gotten it online for a lot cheaper.

2616
02:58:59,066 --> 02:59:01,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you where you can get it once we show it.

2617
02:59:03,509 --> 02:59:06,131
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, he had all the Mega Mans.

2618
02:59:06,791 --> 02:59:09,913
[SPEAKER_12]: He had... I can't remember what...

2619
02:59:10,834 --> 02:59:40,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Nintendo games he had like Little Samson I guess is a really rare NES game he had that in the box sitting in there so there's some rare stuff that I found in the dealer's room and I just can't afford it all we're actually looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I apologize to Bobby's fans I kind of have one eye on the all games chat room but I'm not able to follow there's a lot of chatty chat going on there right now but let's see Breakman says Earthbound for the NES and Bobby let him keep his life he got lucky hmm

2620
02:59:41,631 --> 02:59:44,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I bought this other thing first.

2621
02:59:45,093 --> 02:59:50,396
[SPEAKER_12]: It was my first priority and then I came back and it was gone by the time I had come back the next day.

2622
02:59:52,296 --> 02:59:52,877
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.

2623
02:59:53,957 --> 02:59:57,359
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to find the guy who bought it and end his life.

2624
02:59:58,279 --> 03:00:05,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so if you're the guy that bought the Earthbound on the NES cartridge at DragonCon, Bobby's looking for you.

2625
03:00:06,864 --> 03:00:07,344
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

2626
03:00:07,924 --> 03:00:09,305
[SPEAKER_12]: I want Earthbound Zero sometime.

2627
03:00:09,758 --> 03:00:17,461
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, Bobby, we don't want to keep you from the convention too much longer, but anything else you want to say about the convention or your show or anything for the folks listening?

2628
03:00:19,342 --> 03:00:19,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Not really.

2629
03:00:19,902 --> 03:00:22,503
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, DragonCon, it's been a fun time.

2630
03:00:22,523 --> 03:00:23,643
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of great costumes.

2631
03:00:23,663 --> 03:00:26,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I have not seen Brad from PodCulture yet.

2632
03:00:26,484 --> 03:00:27,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I know he's here.

2633
03:00:27,785 --> 03:00:32,846
[SPEAKER_12]: He's out having dinner somewhere tonight, so I didn't get to, you know, I haven't been able to say hi to him.

2634
03:00:34,127 --> 03:00:36,168
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I mean, no, and here's the great thing, Rob.

2635
03:00:36,588 --> 03:00:36,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2636
03:00:37,219 --> 03:00:38,760
[SPEAKER_12]: They moved PAX next year.

2637
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:40,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you notice that?

2638
03:00:41,382 --> 03:00:42,502
[SPEAKER_12]: PAX got moved.

2639
03:00:42,922 --> 03:00:43,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not.

2640
03:00:43,663 --> 03:00:46,605
[SPEAKER_12]: It's back to its original weekend.

2641
03:00:46,685 --> 03:00:49,066
[SPEAKER_12]: It is the last weekend of August next year.

2642
03:00:49,466 --> 03:00:51,067
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not Labor Day weekend.

2643
03:00:51,107 --> 03:00:52,228
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the weekend before.

2644
03:00:52,708 --> 03:00:53,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2645
03:00:53,168 --> 03:00:54,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Flights are cheaper.

2646
03:00:54,589 --> 03:00:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, flights will be cheaper.

2647
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:56,571
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be great.

2648
03:00:57,091 --> 03:00:58,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I might have to do that next year then.

2649
03:00:59,232 --> 03:01:03,895
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll be able to make it out there and here and I don't have to worry about which one I'm going to.

2650
03:01:05,227 --> 03:01:06,669
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was very happy about that.

2651
03:01:06,989 --> 03:01:09,514
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been trying to keep an eye on PAX News and stuff.

2652
03:01:09,714 --> 03:01:12,879
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll believe the dude can confirm everything when I see it.

2653
03:01:12,999 --> 03:01:14,942
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got video from the show floor.

2654
03:01:15,022 --> 03:01:15,744
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nuts.

2655
03:01:17,737 --> 03:01:21,359
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just, you know, then they can say, oh, by the way, yeah, it won't be coming out for another 10 years.

2656
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:24,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's the guys who did Borderlands now.

2657
03:01:24,221 --> 03:01:28,884
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we were kind of discussing earlier when it was our lead story tonight, as you can probably imagine.

2658
03:01:29,204 --> 03:01:34,007
[SPEAKER_09]: We were kind of talking about how, you know, it's probably not really the same game 3D Realms was developing.

2659
03:01:34,027 --> 03:01:39,611
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just kind of like, okay, well, we've bought this IP from the slaughter of 3D Realms.

2660
03:01:39,991 --> 03:01:43,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just take all these art assets and the idea and see what we can do with it.

2661
03:01:43,493 --> 03:01:45,894
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you actually have a game because it's not the same game.

2662
03:01:49,879 --> 03:01:57,629
[SPEAKER_12]: One last thing, I wanted to do my show this week mainly because I wish I was doing it because Microsoft has been showing a hell of a lot of balls this week.

2663
03:01:58,370 --> 03:01:58,810
[SPEAKER_09]: How so?

2664
03:01:58,830 --> 03:02:01,594
[SPEAKER_12]: With the new controller and the Xbox Live

2665
03:02:02,950 --> 03:02:03,470
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?

2666
03:02:03,490 --> 03:02:08,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Microsoft is just showing a lot of balls this week, and I'm like, damn, they had to do this on the week I'm not doing anything.

2667
03:02:08,051 --> 03:02:08,791
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he is not here.

2668
03:02:31,261 --> 03:02:33,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody else from FNG was able to make it up here.

2669
03:02:33,863 --> 03:02:39,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Derek H asks, is it true that as Chris Gore said, DragonCon is a sluttier version of Comic-Con?

2670
03:02:41,889 --> 03:02:42,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably, yes.

2671
03:02:42,910 --> 03:02:44,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen a lot of hot sluts?

2672
03:02:47,834 --> 03:02:53,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I will make you really have some fun.

2673
03:02:53,358 --> 03:02:53,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

2674
03:02:53,898 --> 03:02:55,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the thing, Rob.

2675
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:59,542
[SPEAKER_12]: The saying goes, if you don't get laid at DragonCon, you're not trying.

2676
03:02:59,762 --> 03:03:00,003
Okay.

2677
03:03:02,472 --> 03:03:04,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've heard that those furries can get pretty aggressive.

2678
03:03:05,693 --> 03:03:06,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Ren Faire.

2679
03:03:06,593 --> 03:03:10,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Just walk into one of those little gift party rooms and you'll have a good time.

2680
03:03:10,214 --> 03:03:12,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Thankfully, I have not seen a single one of them.

2681
03:03:13,575 --> 03:03:14,636
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't seen a furry?

2682
03:03:14,816 --> 03:03:16,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because they're all too busy at the orgy.

2683
03:03:16,837 --> 03:03:21,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they're... If you haven't seen a furry, you're not trying hard enough.

2684
03:03:22,797 --> 03:03:50,830
[SPEAKER_09]: and they don't need a Craigslist posting to get that going they can't now Craigslist has censored the adult services section now on Craigslist apparently so there you go you don't need that here it just happens alright Bobby we're gonna let you go have fun at DragonCon have a blast especially for us since we're not there since it seems like everybody else is going to some convention but us and we'll have a drink in your honor a little later alright

2685
03:03:51,992 --> 03:03:52,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

2686
03:03:52,332 --> 03:03:53,913
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have a drink in your honor over here, too.

2687
03:03:54,013 --> 03:03:54,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

2688
03:03:55,093 --> 03:03:55,333
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2689
03:03:55,373 --> 03:03:55,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, Bobby.

2690
03:03:57,214 --> 03:03:57,514
[SPEAKER_09]: See ya.

2691
03:03:57,874 --> 03:03:58,194
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2692
03:03:58,254 --> 03:04:02,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf, the man who is usually live right now at All Games Radio, but it's a special weekend.

2693
03:04:02,995 --> 03:04:04,536
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Labor Day weekend.

2694
03:04:04,576 --> 03:04:05,536
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing a marathon.

2695
03:04:05,596 --> 03:04:06,596
[SPEAKER_09]: He's at Dragon Con.

2696
03:04:07,136 --> 03:04:08,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott's at Burning Man.

2697
03:04:08,917 --> 03:04:12,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people are at PAX, but we're right here in the OLR studios.

2698
03:04:12,898 --> 03:04:14,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, aren't we having fun together.

2699
03:04:16,019 --> 03:04:18,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there's quite a few of you listening tonight, so I really appreciate that.

2700
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:20,600
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like you guys are with us here.

2701
03:04:20,681 --> 03:04:23,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to keep going and take some more calls.

2702
03:04:23,521 --> 03:04:26,802
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lawns Radio.

2703
03:04:26,822 --> 03:04:30,964
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get in at least a couple more calls before the next break and before we say goodbye to Loki for the night.

2704
03:04:31,864 --> 03:04:33,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll – I don't know what we'll do.

2705
03:04:33,484 --> 03:04:36,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking maybe for the next segment, DarkSakura, I don't know what you think of this.

2706
03:04:36,685 --> 03:04:41,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll go into the vault and just pull some random games and talk about them.

2707
03:04:41,687 --> 03:04:42,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2708
03:04:42,367 --> 03:04:44,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe like gaming memories or whatever.

2709
03:04:45,248 --> 03:04:45,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2710
03:04:45,448 --> 03:04:48,051
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also, we need to take the chat room into the vault somehow.

2711
03:04:48,071 --> 03:04:49,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a laptop or anything?

2712
03:04:49,613 --> 03:04:50,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I got, well, I have mine out in the car.

2713
03:04:51,475 --> 03:04:51,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2714
03:04:51,835 --> 03:04:52,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that.

2715
03:04:52,256 --> 03:04:52,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2716
03:04:52,836 --> 03:04:54,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know that you have the password to your Wi-Fi so we can?

2717
03:04:54,918 --> 03:04:55,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2718
03:04:55,239 --> 03:04:55,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

2719
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:56,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Good deal.

2720
03:04:56,540 --> 03:04:56,940
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do that.

2721
03:04:57,001 --> 03:04:58,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get to hear what it is.

2722
03:04:59,243 --> 03:05:03,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have like an app or something on the iPhone that you can do like adjust in TV or something?

2723
03:05:03,788 --> 03:05:04,168
[SPEAKER_09]: There is...

2724
03:05:06,064 --> 03:05:08,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have a Ustream.

2725
03:05:09,006 --> 03:05:13,850
[SPEAKER_09]: We've actually had for several years, and I guess now's the time to say it, we've had a secret Ustream channel.

2726
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:25,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that secret, it's just that before we went to Justin.tv, literally the week before, I reserved a Ustream for us, but we opted to go with Justin.tv because that's where the All Games Network went.

2727
03:05:26,079 --> 03:05:33,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seemed like most of the folks in the shows that we're related to and so forth all went towards Justin.tv, so we went there for the whole Synergy thing.

2728
03:05:33,764 --> 03:05:35,086
[SPEAKER_09]: because it was kind of the same thing.

2729
03:05:36,988 --> 03:05:48,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that that isn't really the case anymore, some of our fans still broadcast on Justin.TV, and I think that's really cool, but I did get a Ustream application for the phone.

2730
03:05:48,102 --> 03:05:52,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually did a test run the other night just to see how well it worked.

2731
03:05:52,768 --> 03:05:57,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The video quality is kind of poop, but it does let you stream over 3G.

2732
03:05:58,131 --> 03:06:00,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of neat in that regard.

2733
03:06:00,272 --> 03:06:00,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

2734
03:06:01,032 --> 03:06:02,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll broadcast.

2735
03:06:02,833 --> 03:06:06,775
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the video quality is such poop, and we're a radio show.

2736
03:06:07,015 --> 03:06:08,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's really worth it, to be honest.

2737
03:06:08,476 --> 03:06:12,839
[SPEAKER_03]: If you associate your iPhone with the Wi-Fi here, would the app then associate with the Wi-Fi?

2738
03:06:12,939 --> 03:06:17,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It would, but my concern is that it's going to choke the stream.

2739
03:06:17,462 --> 03:06:23,246
[SPEAKER_09]: We were having those problems earlier when the feed was unknowingly broadcasting.

2740
03:06:23,866 --> 03:06:27,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we've had an Orange Lounge Radio Ustream for like three years.

2741
03:06:27,289 --> 03:06:28,029
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't use it.

2742
03:06:28,530 --> 03:06:28,890
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2743
03:06:28,990 --> 03:06:30,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually kind of agree with Derek.

2744
03:06:30,511 --> 03:06:31,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Justin kind of sucks now.

2745
03:06:31,792 --> 03:06:34,414
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not quite what it used to be.

2746
03:06:34,775 --> 03:06:38,798
[SPEAKER_09]: A Ustream has sort of established itself as the definitive place to go for streaming.

2747
03:06:38,858 --> 03:06:40,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2748
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:41,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2749
03:06:42,221 --> 03:06:43,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I really would have to explore.

2750
03:06:43,283 --> 03:06:47,428
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had video so long now ever since we switched studios that I'd really have to explore that.

2751
03:06:47,508 --> 03:06:48,009
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

2752
03:06:48,990 --> 03:06:49,271
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2753
03:06:49,971 --> 03:06:52,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I didn't mean to get off topic.

2754
03:06:52,555 --> 03:06:54,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I was waiting for calls, but none are coming in.

2755
03:06:54,217 --> 03:06:56,099
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we going to do a marathon with no calls?

2756
03:06:56,520 --> 03:06:57,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, people.

2757
03:06:57,781 --> 03:06:58,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Call!

2758
03:06:58,242 --> 03:07:01,525
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try to get at least one more call in before we say goodbye to Loki.

2759
03:07:01,545 --> 03:07:06,469
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2760
03:07:07,009 --> 03:07:09,952
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call, but if you don't get in now, that's okay.

2761
03:07:09,992 --> 03:07:16,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll open it up again around the usual time, about 8 o'clock later this evening and so forth during the OLR marathon.

2762
03:07:16,898 --> 03:07:18,599
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have some more stories we're going to do.

2763
03:07:18,619 --> 03:07:18,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2764
03:07:20,191 --> 03:07:27,297
[SPEAKER_09]: If I have time to write them while other people are talking and I'm not so intoxicated after that drink, we will do some OLR games.

2765
03:07:28,018 --> 03:07:29,159
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a listless topic.

2766
03:07:29,199 --> 03:07:29,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We can think of that later.

2767
03:07:29,939 --> 03:07:30,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.

2768
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:31,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should do match game.

2769
03:07:31,781 --> 03:07:32,581
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do match game.

2770
03:07:32,622 --> 03:07:34,023
[SPEAKER_09]: We have at least four people here.

2771
03:07:34,163 --> 03:07:35,124
[SPEAKER_09]: With Dan, we'll have five.

2772
03:07:35,164 --> 03:07:36,084
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can do a match game.

2773
03:07:36,144 --> 03:07:38,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could also do Mad Libs.

2774
03:07:39,607 --> 03:07:41,009
[SPEAKER_09]: You never did do OLR Mad Libs.

2775
03:07:41,409 --> 03:07:44,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the phone is ringing and my back is turned.

2776
03:07:44,371 --> 03:07:45,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even see it.

2777
03:07:45,132 --> 03:07:45,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Shame on me.

2778
03:07:46,013 --> 03:07:46,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones.

2779
03:07:46,833 --> 03:07:47,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2780
03:07:47,994 --> 03:07:48,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2781
03:07:50,311 --> 03:07:58,015
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Haseo Haseo Oh, Haseo's, okay, hey, how you doing?

2782
03:07:59,576 --> 03:08:03,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing good What is on your mind, my friend?

2783
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:10,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say that roleplaying quests are a bitch Roleplaying quests are a bitch?

2784
03:08:10,522 --> 03:08:11,623
[SPEAKER_09]: What game are you playing right now?

2785
03:08:13,164 --> 03:08:16,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I am playing a free-to-play MMO called Mabinogi

2786
03:08:17,938 --> 03:08:19,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I have never heard of this.

2787
03:08:19,119 --> 03:08:20,480
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to tell us a little more about this.

2788
03:08:20,860 --> 03:08:23,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a website you can download this at or anything like that?

2789
03:08:24,463 --> 03:08:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the nexon.mabinogi.com.

2790
03:08:28,307 --> 03:08:38,014
[SPEAKER_09]: They also do MapleStory and... So is this a very MapleStory-esque kind of game, or is this more Warcraft-inspired, or what's this game kind of like?

2791
03:08:38,395 --> 03:08:40,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Warcraft meets anime.

2792
03:08:41,177 --> 03:08:41,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2793
03:08:42,038 --> 03:08:42,898
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be interesting.

2794
03:08:43,419 --> 03:08:44,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's free?

2795
03:08:44,219 --> 03:08:45,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it ad-supported, or what's the deal?

2796
03:08:47,319 --> 03:08:48,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1% free.

2797
03:08:50,280 --> 03:09:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: You can upgrade to a membership for a month, which gives you a possibility to run a guild, open shops, use a bag, whatnot.

2798
03:09:03,065 --> 03:09:03,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

2799
03:09:04,065 --> 03:09:05,966
[SPEAKER_09]: But this game is being a pain in the ass right now?

2800
03:09:06,186 --> 03:09:08,927
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you're saying that role-playing quests are a bitch?

2801
03:09:10,248 --> 03:09:14,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because each expansion is...

2802
03:09:15,021 --> 03:09:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2803
03:09:15,722 --> 03:09:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: What turns you on to this game?

2804
03:09:17,884 --> 03:09:18,505
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you find out about it?

2805
03:09:37,763 --> 03:09:41,046
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend actually plays it, who I was PBPing against.

2806
03:09:44,989 --> 03:09:47,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly, what other games types of stuff are you into?

2807
03:09:49,432 --> 03:09:55,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I play just about anything except for anything that has Hannah Montana or Barbie attached to it.

2808
03:09:55,877 --> 03:10:00,020
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the Hannah Montana game on DS is apparently pretty sweet, so I don't know, just saying.

2809
03:10:00,060 --> 03:10:03,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard there was a music game on the DS that was actually pretty sweet, just saying.

2810
03:10:03,823 --> 03:10:04,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannah needs to burn.

2811
03:10:05,922 --> 03:10:08,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other party words for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

2812
03:10:15,668 --> 03:10:16,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Neutron movie will be epic.

2813
03:10:17,349 --> 03:10:27,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It better be, because DarkSakura and I are planning an epic trip that will probably preempt the show to go on this stupid trip, so stay tuned.

2814
03:10:27,355 --> 03:10:30,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thank you so much for the call, Haseo, and stay tuned.

2815
03:10:30,497 --> 03:10:32,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to listen for a few more hours to the marathon tonight?

2816
03:10:34,096 --> 03:10:35,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm listening to the whole thing.

2817
03:10:35,316 --> 03:10:35,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2818
03:10:35,717 --> 03:10:36,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing.

2819
03:10:36,257 --> 03:10:36,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck, buddy.

2820
03:10:36,897 --> 03:10:37,197
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2821
03:10:37,597 --> 03:10:38,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, my friend.

2822
03:10:39,498 --> 03:10:39,718
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2823
03:10:39,738 --> 03:10:39,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

2824
03:10:40,238 --> 03:10:40,858
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2825
03:10:40,878 --> 03:10:43,919
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2826
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:45,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We can fit in one more call.

2827
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:45,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

2828
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:46,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We got time.

2829
03:10:47,941 --> 03:10:48,821
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a lot of time.

2830
03:10:48,841 --> 03:10:50,822
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of time.

2831
03:10:50,842 --> 03:10:54,443
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2832
03:10:55,103 --> 03:10:56,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we figured out the whole dinner thing yet?

2833
03:10:57,104 --> 03:11:00,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we doing a... We're going to get taken bakes.

2834
03:11:00,525 --> 03:11:00,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2835
03:11:00,705 --> 03:11:02,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone is going to make the Papa Murphy's run.

2836
03:11:02,702 --> 03:11:03,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2837
03:11:03,942 --> 03:11:06,483
[SPEAKER_09]: When I sober up, I can go, but that's going to take me at least another hour.

2838
03:11:07,084 --> 03:11:07,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2839
03:11:07,584 --> 03:11:08,904
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can't drink anything until then.

2840
03:11:09,284 --> 03:11:10,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You want some Triscuits?

2841
03:11:10,685 --> 03:11:11,625
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be lovely.

2842
03:11:11,765 --> 03:11:11,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2843
03:11:12,245 --> 03:11:12,486
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2844
03:11:12,506 --> 03:11:16,047
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2845
03:11:16,427 --> 03:11:18,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's going to be leaving us after we go to the next break.

2846
03:11:19,088 --> 03:11:20,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I should really take a nap when I get home.

2847
03:11:20,548 --> 03:11:22,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning this morning.

2848
03:11:22,749 --> 03:11:24,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to ask, what is it that you're going to be doing when you go home?

2849
03:11:26,651 --> 03:11:27,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Babysitting.

2850
03:11:28,337 --> 03:11:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really watching the baby.

2851
03:11:29,919 --> 03:11:34,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably go to bed at like... You know, I always say I'm going to go to bed early, but it ends up being 11.

2852
03:11:35,725 --> 03:11:37,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods if I can.

2853
03:11:38,308 --> 03:11:41,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to go grocery shopping because we have nothing in the house.

2854
03:11:41,952 --> 03:11:44,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else do I have to do?

2855
03:11:49,733 --> 03:11:51,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe bid on something on eBay.

2856
03:11:51,275 --> 03:11:52,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Bid on something on eBay.

2857
03:11:53,317 --> 03:11:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Good stuff.

2858
03:11:54,638 --> 03:12:04,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be... I should be getting a Kinect camera in the next few weeks.

2859
03:12:06,018 --> 03:12:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, good luck with that.

2860
03:12:07,659 --> 03:12:09,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is not one of the beta cameras.

2861
03:12:09,299 --> 03:12:14,700
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually the real retail camera with the retail version of Connect Adventures.

2862
03:12:14,940 --> 03:12:17,941
[SPEAKER_07]: If the guy doesn't deliver it, though, then I will get my money back.

2863
03:12:18,761 --> 03:12:19,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Something's going on.

2864
03:12:19,982 --> 03:12:21,862
[SPEAKER_09]: We might not be broadcasting right now.

2865
03:12:21,902 --> 03:12:24,403
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like our Winamp is frozen.

2866
03:12:24,503 --> 03:12:26,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing anything in chat.

2867
03:12:27,264 --> 03:12:30,164
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's just keep going for the podcast's sake.

2868
03:12:31,325 --> 03:12:32,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what's going on.

2869
03:12:34,894 --> 03:12:37,456
[SPEAKER_09]: If folks can hear us or what have you, but it looks like... I'm keeping up with the chat room.

2870
03:12:37,817 --> 03:12:38,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.

2871
03:12:38,897 --> 03:12:41,719
[SPEAKER_09]: All I saw, the last thing I saw was somebody saying parting words for Loki.

2872
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:43,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see anything after that?

2873
03:12:44,041 --> 03:12:45,262
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I saw.

2874
03:12:46,263 --> 03:12:47,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see that.

2875
03:12:47,404 --> 03:12:47,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Something's wrong.

2876
03:12:48,164 --> 03:12:49,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're not hearing us right now.

2877
03:12:49,765 --> 03:12:51,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to start and stop our feed.

2878
03:12:51,627 --> 03:12:53,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it says my nickname's in use already.

2879
03:12:54,049 --> 03:12:54,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.

2880
03:12:54,809 --> 03:12:55,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm disconnected.

2881
03:12:56,811 --> 03:12:57,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's not good.

2882
03:12:57,871 --> 03:12:58,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to reconnect.

2883
03:12:59,953 --> 03:13:01,054
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to reconnect right now.

2884
03:13:02,455 --> 03:13:03,936
[SPEAKER_09]: How many times is this going to happen tonight?

2885
03:13:05,436 --> 03:13:06,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh shit.

2886
03:13:07,158 --> 03:13:09,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And I reconnected using the wrong encoder.

2887
03:13:09,140 --> 03:13:10,281
[SPEAKER_09]: That's real good, Rob.

2888
03:13:10,481 --> 03:13:10,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Real good.

2889
03:13:13,084 --> 03:13:15,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Live radio, the joys, the perils, the heartache.

2890
03:13:17,847 --> 03:13:20,008
[SPEAKER_09]: The Trials, The Tribulations Okay, we're back up.

2891
03:13:20,288 --> 03:13:20,829
[SPEAKER_09]: We're live.

2892
03:13:20,909 --> 03:13:22,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So slowly folks are going to be coming back on.

2893
03:13:23,330 --> 03:13:28,193
[SPEAKER_09]: That might explain why the Skype line hasn't been ringing if our internet just suddenly decided to crap out.

2894
03:13:29,254 --> 03:13:31,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, it looks like I'm reconnecting slowly but surely.

2895
03:13:32,776 --> 03:13:34,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on AIM the entire time.

2896
03:13:34,356 --> 03:13:35,057
[SPEAKER_09]: It just died again.

2897
03:13:35,297 --> 03:13:36,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It died again?

2898
03:13:37,218 --> 03:13:39,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on AIM the entire time and had no problem.

2899
03:13:40,420 --> 03:13:43,822
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows that we are connected on Shoutcast.

2900
03:13:46,553 --> 03:13:48,334
[SPEAKER_09]: This is bad stuff.

2901
03:13:48,354 --> 03:13:51,035
[SPEAKER_07]: It says auto-accessive connections from a single host.

2902
03:13:51,475 --> 03:13:52,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fuck.

2903
03:13:52,596 --> 03:13:55,417
[SPEAKER_07]: G-line from Game Surge.

2904
03:13:55,617 --> 03:14:01,039
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got booted from chat altogether because there's too many of us trying to connect because our ghosts were still lurking there.

2905
03:14:01,979 --> 03:14:02,760
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

2906
03:14:03,100 --> 03:14:05,701
[SPEAKER_09]: So we might have just lost the chat room for the rest of the evening.

2907
03:14:05,781 --> 03:14:06,661
[SPEAKER_09]: That is wonderful.

2908
03:14:06,881 --> 03:14:11,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Those G-lines reset after like 10, 15 minutes.

2909
03:14:11,143 --> 03:14:12,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends.

2910
03:14:12,524 --> 03:14:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they?

2911
03:14:12,944 --> 03:14:13,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2912
03:14:13,824 --> 03:14:14,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Have some driskets, Rob.

2913
03:14:15,845 --> 03:14:18,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, so now we have to marathon with no chat room.

2914
03:14:18,727 --> 03:14:19,647
[SPEAKER_09]: This ought to be lovely.

2915
03:14:19,667 --> 03:14:20,108
[SPEAKER_07]: For now.

2916
03:14:22,789 --> 03:14:23,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Well.

2917
03:14:23,670 --> 03:14:24,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that sucks.

2918
03:14:25,031 --> 03:14:25,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta go now.

2919
03:14:28,593 --> 03:14:30,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, this is great.

2920
03:14:30,955 --> 03:14:39,240
[SPEAKER_09]: If I probably load the Twitter, there's going to be a million people tweeting going, Try it through the web browser, because that uses like a proxy thing.

2921
03:14:39,400 --> 03:14:39,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, does it?

2922
03:14:39,980 --> 03:14:40,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do that.

2923
03:14:42,022 --> 03:14:43,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I need someone to help me fill time here real quick.

2924
03:14:43,542 --> 03:14:44,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to web chat.

2925
03:14:47,170 --> 03:14:47,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes that works.

2926
03:14:47,910 --> 03:14:49,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, we're all here chewing on Triscuits.

2927
03:14:53,311 --> 03:14:54,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, that's the marathon.

2928
03:14:54,092 --> 03:14:55,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to be like eight hours of this.

2929
03:14:55,952 --> 03:14:59,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Chewing on Triscuits and Rob hunting down a way to get in.

2930
03:14:59,453 --> 03:15:00,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I need to get our chat.

2931
03:15:00,513 --> 03:15:01,854
[SPEAKER_09]: The chat's like, oh God.

2932
03:15:02,294 --> 03:15:03,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It wants me to install Java.

2933
03:15:03,314 --> 03:15:06,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me try to reconnect here real quick on the old-fashioned way.

2934
03:15:06,515 --> 03:15:07,115
[SPEAKER_09]: See if that works.

2935
03:15:10,156 --> 03:15:10,656
[SPEAKER_09]: We need chat.

2936
03:15:10,756 --> 03:15:14,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Our skypline is supposedly open, so if somebody can hear us, you can call us.

2937
03:15:15,217 --> 03:15:15,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.

2938
03:15:17,276 --> 03:15:22,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, it's showing that we're G-line still, because I guess too many of us were on at once.

2939
03:15:24,099 --> 03:15:31,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up, though, according to... Try the chat app in IE, maybe, if it's on that machine.

2940
03:15:32,282 --> 03:15:35,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Java may be separate for Firefox, if that's what you're using.

2941
03:15:37,504 --> 03:15:38,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I will do that.

2942
03:15:41,605 --> 03:15:42,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Skype line is still open.

2943
03:15:42,886 --> 03:15:46,407
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2944
03:15:47,512 --> 03:15:48,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hopping in web chat.

2945
03:15:48,873 --> 03:15:50,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Your mic is also dying a lot.

2946
03:15:51,295 --> 03:15:52,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in web chat.

2947
03:15:52,095 --> 03:15:53,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get there anyway.

2948
03:15:53,276 --> 03:15:53,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you?

2949
03:15:53,916 --> 03:15:56,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It still says G-Lined for web chat.

2950
03:15:57,299 --> 03:15:59,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're getting at least a call.

2951
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:01,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio.

2952
03:16:01,782 --> 03:16:02,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2953
03:16:02,843 --> 03:16:03,503
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ron McGinn.

2954
03:16:03,523 --> 03:16:06,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Just call me your support team staff because that's pretty much what I am.

2955
03:16:06,605 --> 03:16:07,085
[SPEAKER_09]: You again.

2956
03:16:07,165 --> 03:16:07,446
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2957
03:16:07,466 --> 03:16:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're up, right?

2958
03:16:09,707 --> 03:16:10,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys can hear us again?

2959
03:16:10,988 --> 03:16:12,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can hear you fine.

2960
03:16:12,809 --> 03:16:20,851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that the whole G-Line thing, because that happens when there's more than three or four people from the same IP that logs into the chat.

2961
03:16:20,991 --> 03:16:30,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is custom that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki will all log in, but unfortunately when we tried to log back in after we got booted from our internet, we all got G-Lined.

2962
03:16:30,855 --> 03:16:31,915
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a chat right now.

2963
03:16:32,395 --> 03:16:35,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I just sent you guys a tweet on how to circumvent the whole thing.

2964
03:16:36,077 --> 03:16:36,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not working.

2965
03:16:36,817 --> 03:16:38,237
[SPEAKER_09]: It still says G-Line.

2966
03:16:38,277 --> 03:16:40,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't we just have to wait like 15 minutes and we'll be fine?

2967
03:16:41,567 --> 03:16:42,007
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

2968
03:17:00,882 --> 03:17:02,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, this is Eric Hatcher, a.k.a.

2969
03:17:02,883 --> 03:17:03,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Tridane.

2970
03:17:03,564 --> 03:17:06,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been a long-time listener, but I'm a lurker, mostly.

2971
03:17:06,606 --> 03:17:07,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

2972
03:17:08,447 --> 03:17:09,707
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a heck of a night to call in.

2973
03:17:09,727 --> 03:17:11,489
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just having technical difficulties left and right.

2974
03:17:11,529 --> 03:17:12,749
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't see our audience right now.

2975
03:17:14,270 --> 03:17:16,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's part of the reason I called, I guess.

2976
03:17:16,232 --> 03:17:24,877
[SPEAKER_11]: If I sound out of breath, it's because I'm on the walking track, and I'm using you guys to pass the time while I work off the weight on my lord-ass gaming butt.

2977
03:17:25,477 --> 03:17:25,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2978
03:17:26,518 --> 03:17:27,719
[SPEAKER_09]: What types of games are you into?

2979
03:17:27,779 --> 03:17:28,799
[SPEAKER_09]: What types of games do you play?

2980
03:17:30,899 --> 03:17:32,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, just a little bit of everything.

2981
03:17:32,821 --> 03:17:34,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much all the modern systems, I'd say.

2982
03:17:35,843 --> 03:17:42,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly the Xbox 360, and of course I get my MMORPG still from EverQuest.

2983
03:17:43,430 --> 03:17:45,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Still EverQuest after all these years?

2984
03:17:45,932 --> 03:17:46,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Why EverQuest?

2985
03:17:48,134 --> 03:17:50,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess it's because of the people I know there.

2986
03:17:50,215 --> 03:17:51,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been on the same server for 11 years now.

2987
03:17:51,777 --> 03:17:53,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's probably the people that keep you coming back, huh?

2988
03:18:00,248 --> 03:18:01,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that is exactly what it is.

2989
03:18:02,169 --> 03:18:02,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree 100%.

2990
03:18:21,238 --> 03:18:23,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly why I kept playing for so long.

2991
03:18:23,039 --> 03:18:23,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2992
03:18:24,959 --> 03:18:28,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I just caught the last 20 or 30 minutes or so.

2993
03:18:28,780 --> 03:18:39,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Something I guess I'd like to talk about is, I don't know if y'all are familiar, there's a game that came out within the last couple of weeks, last week or so, called Elemental, the War of Magic.

2994
03:18:49,668 --> 03:18:50,288
[SPEAKER_11]: on the PC.

2995
03:18:50,388 --> 03:18:51,609
[SPEAKER_11]: It's had a lot of trouble.

2996
03:18:51,809 --> 03:18:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've heard of it.

2997
03:18:53,249 --> 03:18:54,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think I've played it.

2998
03:18:54,530 --> 03:18:56,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I haven't played it, but I think I've heard of this.

2999
03:18:56,590 --> 03:18:57,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit more about this game.

3000
03:18:58,911 --> 03:19:06,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's by the company Stardock, and Brad Wardall is probably the lead designer on that, I believe.

3001
03:19:06,934 --> 03:19:16,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty nice guy, but this is the worst, most buzziest piece of software I've played in the last 20 years, I guess.

3002
03:19:17,438 --> 03:19:17,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Whew!

3003
03:19:19,959 --> 03:19:26,861
[SPEAKER_11]: playing computer games, which is very unfortunate because the game has a lot of potential.

3004
03:19:26,901 --> 03:19:33,662
[SPEAKER_11]: If any of you are familiar with Masters of Magic, it's sort of a civilization-like game with a fantasy bent.

3005
03:19:34,723 --> 03:19:36,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, those are like all of my favorite games you just said.

3006
03:19:39,364 --> 03:19:43,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, and it has so much potential, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.

3007
03:19:44,465 --> 03:19:44,965
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.

3008
03:19:46,423 --> 03:19:52,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate it when you've got a game that sounds like such a good idea, like on paper, but then in execution it sucks.

3009
03:19:53,768 --> 03:19:54,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, exactly.

3010
03:19:55,189 --> 03:19:56,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

3011
03:19:56,629 --> 03:19:59,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I just mostly called to help you out with a little bit of time.

3012
03:19:59,891 --> 03:20:00,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

3013
03:20:00,552 --> 03:20:02,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I don't really have a whole lot to say.

3014
03:20:02,293 --> 03:20:02,833
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright.

3015
03:20:02,873 --> 03:20:04,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, where'd you say you're calling from?

3016
03:20:05,955 --> 03:20:06,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, big pardon?

3017
03:20:06,896 --> 03:20:07,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Where'd you say you're calling from?

3018
03:20:09,497 --> 03:20:11,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, basically Birmingham, Alabama.

3019
03:20:11,999 --> 03:20:12,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

3020
03:20:12,479 --> 03:20:13,300
[SPEAKER_05]: From my home state then?

3021
03:20:13,320 --> 03:20:13,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

3022
03:20:14,657 --> 03:20:15,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, exactly.

3023
03:20:16,478 --> 03:20:22,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I've spent many, many a time up in Birmingham, although I spent more time around Dothan and Montgomery.

3024
03:20:24,700 --> 03:20:26,481
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Mobile's my hometown.

3025
03:20:28,581 --> 03:20:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice to talk to someone from my home state.

3026
03:20:30,422 --> 03:20:30,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

3027
03:20:32,162 --> 03:20:32,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

3028
03:20:33,483 --> 03:20:37,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice talking to y'all, and I look forward to listening to you more as the evening progresses.

3029
03:20:37,944 --> 03:20:38,684
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, sounds good.

3030
03:20:38,704 --> 03:20:39,505
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a good one, buddy.

3031
03:20:39,705 --> 03:20:40,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tuning in.

3032
03:20:41,945 --> 03:20:42,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

3033
03:20:42,486 --> 03:20:42,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

3034
03:20:42,866 --> 03:20:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, bye-bye.

3035
03:20:45,300 --> 03:20:49,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I can almost always pick out an Alabama accent.

3036
03:20:49,525 --> 03:20:51,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, bing, radar.

3037
03:20:52,688 --> 03:20:52,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

3038
03:20:53,570 --> 03:20:55,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well we're going to go ahead and go to a break.

3039
03:20:55,652 --> 03:21:00,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I just downloaded an IRC chat client to my phone to try and connect.

3040
03:21:00,818 --> 03:21:01,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.

3041
03:21:01,999 --> 03:21:02,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it.

3042
03:21:04,147 --> 03:21:06,447
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're saying, wait, did Loki, yeah, I can see chat.

3043
03:21:06,487 --> 03:21:09,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have chat open on my phone right now.

3044
03:21:09,408 --> 03:21:11,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So I finally have a lifeblood into the chat room.

3045
03:21:11,688 --> 03:21:12,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

3046
03:21:12,749 --> 03:21:15,029
[SPEAKER_09]: So chatters, I can now see you again.

3047
03:21:16,109 --> 03:21:17,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't send me private messages.

3048
03:21:17,489 --> 03:21:20,150
[SPEAKER_09]: If you figure out what my name is on there, it's not too hard to figure out.

3049
03:21:20,190 --> 03:21:21,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't send me private messages.

3050
03:21:21,830 --> 03:21:22,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got another call coming in.

3051
03:21:23,891 --> 03:21:25,411
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be our last call before we take another break.

3052
03:21:25,451 --> 03:21:26,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3053
03:21:26,371 --> 03:21:26,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

3054
03:21:28,111 --> 03:21:29,152
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Toy Gak.

3055
03:21:29,372 --> 03:21:30,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Toy Gak.

3056
03:21:30,352 --> 03:21:30,892
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, buddy?

3057
03:21:30,912 --> 03:21:31,372
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

3058
03:21:32,797 --> 03:21:39,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I just called in because I'm going to give you the URL you'd need to go to to get the G-Line removed.

3059
03:21:39,686 --> 03:21:40,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what is that?

3060
03:21:41,708 --> 03:21:49,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gamesurge.net slash utils slash G-Line.

3061
03:21:52,338 --> 03:21:53,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm looking at that right now.

3062
03:21:53,839 --> 03:21:57,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, 1G line found for your host, resolved in an hour.

3063
03:22:00,302 --> 03:22:03,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I'm on that page and it says why we're banned, okay.

3064
03:22:07,346 --> 03:22:09,006
[SPEAKER_09]: It will only last one hour.

3065
03:22:10,207 --> 03:22:12,568
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go, we just have to wait out the hour then.

3066
03:22:13,689 --> 03:22:14,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Jerks.

3067
03:22:14,709 --> 03:22:17,931
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay, so we got till 625 with no chat, but that's okay because I got chat on my phone.

3068
03:22:18,371 --> 03:22:19,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured it out, I worked around.

3069
03:22:23,509 --> 03:22:39,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a reminder, it's probably a bad idea to circumvent the G-line because they can tell.

3070
03:22:39,954 --> 03:22:40,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on my iPhone.

3071
03:22:40,734 --> 03:22:41,335
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 3G.

3072
03:22:41,575 --> 03:22:41,975
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

3073
03:22:42,795 --> 03:22:43,255
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be okay.

3074
03:22:43,275 --> 03:22:44,015
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not on Comcast.

3075
03:22:44,055 --> 03:22:44,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows us 3G.

3076
03:22:45,536 --> 03:22:46,356
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be our little secret.

3077
03:22:50,819 --> 03:22:52,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well thanks for the tip, we appreciate it.

3078
03:22:52,743 --> 03:22:55,629
[SPEAKER_09]: At least we know it's only for an hour, so we know we'll be able to get back in.

3079
03:22:56,891 --> 03:22:58,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, have a good one buddy.

3080
03:22:59,668 --> 03:23:00,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, bye.

3081
03:23:00,689 --> 03:23:01,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the tip.

3082
03:23:02,250 --> 03:23:06,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're gonna, on that note, I think we need a break after that, oh boy.

3083
03:23:06,792 --> 03:23:09,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, people are saying hi.

3084
03:23:09,434 --> 03:23:10,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Why were you banned?

3085
03:23:10,535 --> 03:23:12,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they don't like more than three people on the same IP.

3086
03:23:12,956 --> 03:23:13,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew Nami's got it there.

3087
03:23:14,597 --> 03:23:23,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're saying actually it's five, says Toagak, but I don't... It says three on the page that explains why you're G-lined.

3088
03:23:24,283 --> 03:23:24,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird.

3089
03:23:25,283 --> 03:23:34,267
[SPEAKER_03]: When various clients try to reconnect and disconnect due to internet issues within a certain amount of time, the server has no way of knowing what's going on and it kind of thinks it's a DDoS.

3090
03:23:34,507 --> 03:23:36,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a denial of service.

3091
03:23:36,748 --> 03:23:37,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a failsafe.

3092
03:23:39,109 --> 03:23:40,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll forgive them someday.

3093
03:23:40,850 --> 03:23:42,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll find it in my heart to forgive them.

3094
03:23:43,171 --> 03:23:47,133
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to actually say goodbye to Loki at this point before we go to another break.

3095
03:23:47,733 --> 03:23:49,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any final words for our listeners tonight?

3096
03:23:50,390 --> 03:23:51,911
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just have to go get groceries.

3097
03:23:52,552 --> 03:23:53,153
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always fun.

3098
03:23:53,173 --> 03:23:54,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't like chores.

3099
03:23:54,814 --> 03:23:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well good luck with all that.

3100
03:23:56,415 --> 03:24:01,280
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually the part of the show where we would be saying basically goodnight for listening.

3101
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:04,222
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of the end of the normal part of the show, if you will.

3102
03:24:04,603 --> 03:24:06,184
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be getting into the more random stuff.

3103
03:24:06,224 --> 03:24:11,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're just looking for your normal quote-unquote edition of Orange Lounge Radio, this is kind of the end of that part.

3104
03:24:11,689 --> 03:24:14,391
[SPEAKER_09]: But we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

3105
03:24:14,431 --> 03:24:16,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Now just so you know, for the podcast feed...

3106
03:24:16,593 --> 03:24:19,537
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be releasing the marathon in bits this week.

3107
03:24:19,657 --> 03:24:22,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So you may not see everything up right away.

3108
03:24:22,380 --> 03:24:24,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So just give it a little extra time.

3109
03:24:24,803 --> 03:24:31,672
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're done listening to this part of the podcast and you want more, just give it a little more time.

3110
03:24:31,692 --> 03:24:32,252
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we need.

3111
03:24:34,634 --> 03:24:40,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick, I was going to say we're having our game summit, my work game summit thing.

3112
03:24:40,619 --> 03:24:45,383
[SPEAKER_07]: We do it usually each year and we have the game publishers coming out and talking about stuff.

3113
03:24:45,783 --> 03:24:50,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe I'll learn some new information and we can share at appropriate times if you know what I mean.

3114
03:24:51,337 --> 03:24:51,597
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

3115
03:24:52,098 --> 03:24:54,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And that'll be something to look forward to next week, yes?

3116
03:24:54,099 --> 03:24:54,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

3117
03:24:54,439 --> 03:24:57,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, hopefully, I'll have a new iPod by then.

3118
03:24:58,222 --> 03:24:58,523
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

3119
03:24:59,103 --> 03:25:00,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

3120
03:25:00,324 --> 03:25:04,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I play the closing song that we usually play at the end here?

3121
03:25:04,367 --> 03:25:05,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Play our little closing song?

3122
03:25:05,768 --> 03:25:06,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

3123
03:25:06,229 --> 03:25:08,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, because you've got to put it on the podcast anyways, don't you?

3124
03:25:08,871 --> 03:25:09,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

3125
03:25:09,571 --> 03:25:10,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me see.

3126
03:25:10,692 --> 03:25:11,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I have to cue that up.

3127
03:25:11,953 --> 03:25:12,814
[SPEAKER_09]: That involves work.

3128
03:25:13,314 --> 03:25:33,196
[SPEAKER_09]: so goodnight everybody thanks for listening we'll be back though if you are listening live or on podcast or whatever we still got the marathon coming up and plenty more show who knows what randomness is going to happen when we don't have a chat room going on here and some folks in chat are saying goodnight and they're waving even though you can't see them and I'm getting everything up from uh

3129
03:25:35,478 --> 03:25:39,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, Toagak says if my IRC server was up, I would let them bounce IRC off of me.

3130
03:25:39,681 --> 03:25:40,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's a good idea.

3131
03:25:40,522 --> 03:25:45,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody should put up like a fake server that we can go on and at least see our chat room still.

3132
03:25:45,385 --> 03:25:49,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my roommate has a Linux box running in the spare bedroom.

3133
03:25:49,508 --> 03:25:49,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

3134
03:25:49,989 --> 03:25:52,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could shell into that and we can IRC from there.

3135
03:25:52,631 --> 03:25:55,553
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be a good idea, but I'm not going to worry about it too much.

3136
03:25:55,593 --> 03:25:56,473
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just an hour, right?

3137
03:25:56,493 --> 03:25:57,234
[SPEAKER_09]: We can make it an hour.

3138
03:25:58,155 --> 03:25:58,595
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do it.

3139
03:25:59,366 --> 03:26:05,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to play our outro, say goodnight, and we'll be back though with more of the OLR Marathon right after this.

3140
03:26:22,702 --> 03:26:23,103
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week!

3141
03:26:23,123 --> 03:26:23,843
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week!
