00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,320
Today, September 5th, 2010, the 360 is set to get a new controller.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,720
News from PAX includes the return of a long forgotten game franchise, and could comic

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:32,280
books be coming to the PS3?

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,960
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Radio.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,880
We are that show where every gamer has a voice, and joining you over the next several, many,

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,160
long hours.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,240
My name is Rob Roberts, sometimes going by Skye in our chatroom and so forth.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,840
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Hi.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
How are you?

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm on podcast number two for the day.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,040
I know, yes.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,480
You're having quite the podcasting day, but we'll get to that in a minute.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,200
But we also have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Hello.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
How are you?

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm good.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
I made an observation this morning, I was trying to confirm.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,960
What is that?

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,300
I don't know if anybody remembers the guy, Reginald Vell-Johnson.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
You may remember him.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Was he the dad on Family Matters?

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,560
He was the dad on Family Matters.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Oh!

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,080
Dude, I'm a pop culture sponge!

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,120
Anyways, I was watching Ghostbusters today because they were playing it on Comedy Central,

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
and he was a cop in that.

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm like, how many fucking movies and shows has he been a damn police officer in?

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,320
Because he's always a goddamn police officer in everything.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,880
Quite a few, actually.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,320
Die Hard 1, Die Hard 2, and Ghostbusters, as well as Family Matters.

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,720
And of course I'd have to go through the rest of these to figure out which ones of these

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,000
he's actually a police officer, but it just has his name on there.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But it's just weird.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Orange Round Studio.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Talk about...

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know, what has he done lately?

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Can we get him on the show, maybe, to do some voiceovers?

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,440
He was also in Die Hard Vendetta, the video game, as his character.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Oh, hey!

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Oh, bringing it back to games.

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
There you go.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Love it.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Alright.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Over the next many hours, we are going to be talking about video games.

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,880
Look, it is a, if you haven't heard, it's a special episode today, tonight, and so forth.

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,700
We decided that, and I don't know why we decided this, it was really just one of those kind

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,520
of random things, because we like to do that around here, that we're going to broadcast

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
as long as we can today.

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,440
We're actually having an early start, so we are live at All Games Radio.

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,280
We do tape live every Sunday at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,000
Black Wolf show, usually.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,560
But today it's 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern, and we're starting to show a little

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,880
bit early, because the plan is...

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,020
It's 10 o'clock in England.

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,680
We're going to go, yeah, 10 at night.

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,960
So finally we're getting kind of an earlier show in for them, so I hope some folks overseas

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,680
are listening too.

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
But we're going to actually try to go late tonight.

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,380
I don't know how late.

62
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,680
The goal is midnight.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,120
We might go longer.

64
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,600
We might go not as long.

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,660
I don't know, but we'll see.

66
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,480
So we're doing the marathon episode.

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Why?

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Because we can.

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,900
Why not?

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,920
It's not, it's not a fundraiser for anything.

71
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I mean, you should donate to charities, you know, do good in your life, that, but we're

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,320
just doing this for fun, because everybody else is at some freaking convention this weekend,

73
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,480
so we're having a little mini festival of our own.

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,440
We do have some guests joining us in the studio here today.

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
I don't know how long they'll be with us.

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,780
I think he'll be with us the whole time.

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,760
Say hello to Salacious Pop or Alan.

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Hello.

79
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
How are you?

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Much better than last time.

81
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Really?

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
What was wrong last time?

83
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
I had food poisoning when I was on the show.

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Oh, that's right.

85
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,400
You were recovering from the Reno trip.

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Yes.

87
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
But you're feeling much better today.

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes.

89
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
All right.

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
Yeah, I was a little worried about that, because we're doing this marathon today.

91
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,040
We didn't really plan it out very well.

92
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,880
It's just like, hey, let's broadcast for 12 hours.

93
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Okay.

94
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,680
You know, oh, when are we going to eat?

95
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
So I don't know.

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,100
Hopefully Dan is going to be back at some point where we'll be able to kind of rotate

97
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
in and out.

98
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,840
So learn with us here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
Just order a pizza.

100
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,640
Just put the pizza guy on the show.

101
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
So talk about games.

102
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
And he's like, I'm going to get fired.

103
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah.

104
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
You know what?

105
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,600
If it wasn't that Dan couldn't have the sodium, we could totally just do a take and bake.

106
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,560
Send Dan off to be our errand boy.

107
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Good times.

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Get a Papa Murphy's.

109
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Good times.

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,440
Also joining us, say hello to Bradley, our KDN 42.

111
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,520
You said there'd be surprises.

112
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm the first one.

113
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
All right.

114
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
How are you?

115
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,880
You were on the show a couple months ago, but then like before that, you weren't on

116
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
for like a couple years.

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
I was on a few months ago.

118
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
I don't remember.

119
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
I thought you were.

120
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Oh, well.

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,520
I think the last time I was on was at your house that you were at.

122
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Oh, that was a while ago.

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
I thought for some reason.

124
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Oh, well.

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Whatever.

126
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I think you maybe mentioned me, because I was here for her party or something before

127
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
that.

128
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
That might have been it.

129
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
That might have been it.

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
And then I popped in the chat room like once or twice.

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
There you go.

132
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Well, what's new with Bradley?

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
What are you up to?

134
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Well, I hadn't been playing any games since last week, because I was on the road.

135
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,440
I did like a seven-day trip of national parks.

136
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
You do a lot of that.

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,080
You do a lot of like, I'm just going to get my car and drive until I run out of gas type

138
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
of thing.

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Yeah.

140
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Right?

141
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
So what are some of the like awesome places you've been to?

142
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,600
I went to Yellowstone, and then I went after that was also Grand Teton, because you have

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,180
to go through that if you're in one of the directions.

144
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,800
Then the next one was Theodore Roosevelt, which I just kind of drove around.

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,240
And also the next day was Rocky Mountain, where you go up like 12,000 feet when driving.

146
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,840
Then Arches, which have all the natural arches in it, and Canyonlands, which is a big canyon.

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,160
Also was, what's the next one after that, was Coral Reef, or Capitol Reef.

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Bradley, I'm thinking you should just be a park ranger.

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Like can't you see Bradley is a park ranger?

150
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,280
Like I could totally see that.

151
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,280
He'd just be in his cabin during the winters with the Xbox, and what have you.

152
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Good time.

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Actually, now, let me give a little background on Orange L'Angereo.

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,680
Since we have a lot of extra time today, I can kind of do that for the people who haven't

155
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,640
listened in a very, or who are just now listening, or you haven't heard this story because you

156
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,360
haven't told it in a long time.

157
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Here's what Orange L'Angereo is all about.

158
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,080
We've been broadcasting for about eight years, right?

159
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Over eight years?

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
I lost count at some point.

161
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,280
It's almost coming up on nine years, but we've been broadcasting about eight years.

162
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,600
Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki all met at a local arcade, and actually Bradley was a part

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,440
of this too, all playing Dance Dance Revolution.

164
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,180
We all just got sucked into this game, and it was this whole little like culture and

165
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,560
scene for a time, and there were websites that just got so much traffic when these games

166
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,960
were really at their peak, at least as far as I can tell.

167
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,480
Things like DDR Freak and Spot and so forth.

168
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,760
DDR's still around, but the culture isn't quite the same as it used to be back in my

169
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,200
day, but we decided to start a show about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution and that whole

170
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,300
scene, and that's the way the show was for about the first, what, about three, four years

171
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
we were doing that?

172
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,100
Then when podcasting came around, we got into doing that.

173
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,320
We used to do a spinoff show.

174
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,800
It was a spinoff show of our main show about just video games in general, and then that

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,320
kind of took off and ended up kind of taking over the DDR part when music games and so

176
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,600
forth were not so popular anymore, so we kind of just built this show around a community,

177
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,500
and that is really what our show is all about at the end of the day, is that after these

178
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,120
long DDR nights at Golfland or wherever we were at, we would go have dinner at a local

179
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,000
restaurant and just talk smack about video games and sometimes each other, so that's

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
kind of what we tried to bring to the show here.

181
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,200
We like to call ourselves the show where every gamer has a voice.

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Since the very beginning, we've always tried to incorporate chat, and this is before podcasting

183
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
was really huge.

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,600
We tried to incorporate all of this into our show.

185
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,560
I like to think we were one of the first shows that did take calls over Skype, and it's kind

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,840
of interesting now that that is the way a lot of podcasts do their whole shows now is

187
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,040
over Skype, so it was kind of neat to be... I don't know if we were the first.

188
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,800
We were definitely one of the first to do that, so that was kind of cool to be on the

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
cutting edge of that.

190
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,680
So we try to get on the Twitters and the Facebooks and chat and all the ways that you guys can

191
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,200
interact with us, and give us your opinion.

192
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,060
It's because we're technologically able.

193
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,160
We have the technology.

194
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,320
We can repair something.

195
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Something something.

196
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
All right.

197
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,160
So anyway, the reason why I give that background is that we all kind of bring different things

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
to the table.

199
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,800
We all like different types of games.

200
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,300
For instance, Dark Sakura, she does the classic game of the week here on the show every week

201
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:27,240
because she has a vast brain full of useless video game trivia and these obscure ass import

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,880
games, even I don't hear of ever, so that's kind of her background, right?

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,840
Is that the kind of fair assessment?

204
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Yeah.

205
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Yeah.

206
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,800
And then Loki... Speaking of random trivia, he has been in

207
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,640
nine different shows or series playing a law enforcement officer.

208
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,280
Granted, the one in Ghostbusters, he was a prison guard, but God damn it, that's close

209
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
enough.

210
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,940
So, nine different series or movies or...

211
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,480
Don't you have to be an officer to be a prison guard?

212
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,560
It's still a law enforcement job, so... But yeah, that's a lot.

213
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,360
He's just really typecast, so... Anyways, enough talking about him.

214
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm not going to talk about him anymore.

215
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Promise?

216
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Promise.

217
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
You're going to have a good 12 hours to do so.

218
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,480
I know you're not staying the whole time, but all right.

219
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,160
Anyway, Loki is kind of... I see him as more of like our tech hack crack.

220
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,980
If there's a way to break the game, he will kind of guy.

221
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,320
He was the guy that probably bought a game genie as soon as they were out to see how

222
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,600
he could screw up the game.

223
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,160
I bought one, though.

224
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,080
Would that be kind of a fair assessment of what you're all about?

225
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Sure.

226
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
All right.

227
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
And then me, I don't know.

228
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,680
I grew up on Commodore 64 and all the old school games, so I like to think of myself

229
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,920
as kind of like a retro-y gamer as well, but I like a lot of new stuff, too.

230
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,560
I think lately it's been MMOs.

231
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
I've played a lot of them, and a lot of computer games, too.

232
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,820
I mean, not all of them, but I try to do them, so I'm just kind of a little bit of everything.

233
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,300
And then the reason why I kind of lay all that out is I want to ask Bradley, what types

234
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,280
of games do you bring... What's your gaming background?

235
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,360
What do you like, what are your likes and dislikes in gaming?

236
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,800
Generally, I play a lot... Most types of games, other than that, maybe sports.

237
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I don't really play sports all that much.

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
I play them a little bit, but not that much.

239
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,960
I play mostly puzzle games, played RPGs, I used to play those a lot more than I do now

240
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,440
just because I don't have the time to play a long form like that.

241
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Adventure games, and so on.

242
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,760
Cool deal, cool deal.

243
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,960
I always think it's a bad idea when people go around saying, I hate all sports games,

244
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,520
or I hate sports video games.

245
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,320
Sports video games are crap.

246
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,180
A lot of people on this show, it may not be the preference of the types of games we play

247
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,360
most of the time, but I think it would be a lie to say I hate all sports games, because

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,160
I love NBA Jam, and I love that it's coming back as an awesome game.

249
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,040
I have a way to make it very nice and simple for you.

250
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,200
It's just like racing games, how you have your arcade racing games, which are fun to

251
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,600
play, and your simulation racing games, which require you to be able to drive and tune a

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,820
car with the same precision that you would a real car.

253
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,000
You hate simulation sports games.

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,520
You do arcade style sports games, though.

255
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,860
That actually makes a lot of sense, because... And then over there, those folks, usually

256
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,960
it's like, oh, well, I hate all those Japanese RPGs.

257
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,440
There's too much of the same stuff, but maybe I'll play Final Fantasy.

258
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,720
I'll play that one that is kind of out in the mainstream, or music games.

259
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,840
A lot of people are like, that arrow stomping, no, what is that?

260
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,920
That Japanese ravy techno music?

261
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
What is that?

262
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
What is that?

263
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,480
And I sort of see that as the hardcore music games.

264
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,480
BeatMania 2DX is a hardcore music game, but I'm sure everybody has enjoyed Guitar Hero

265
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
at least once.

266
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,720
A rock band, at a party, drunk.

267
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,400
So it's kind of interesting.

268
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
This ties into an email.

269
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
I don't recommend DDR drunk.

270
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,360
Well, it can be fun.

271
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
Until you hit your head.

272
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Responsibly.

273
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680
We had an email on the show last week that kind of got me thinking about all this, was

274
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,280
the whole, my friend says I'm not a gamer because I don't play X, Y, and Z. Remember

275
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
that?

276
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,080
I've been thinking about that email a lot this week, and just like, A, where does your

277
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,640
friend get off telling you that?

278
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Anyway.

279
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
All right.

280
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,280
Yeah, well, your friend's a butt.

281
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,200
Let's get into how we always like to start off the show here at Orange Lounge Radio even

282
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,080
though we're, what, like 12 minutes in now.

283
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,580
How was your gaming week?

284
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,760
What kind of video games have you been playing this week, and how were they?

285
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

286
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,040
It was kind of not, because I've, it's been a busy week for me.

287
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:32,800
I had school, and I had my visit to the mikvah on Thursday.

288
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,960
My conversion went through.

289
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,760
I am now the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio.

290
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Congrats!

291
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,680
Although, SSJ100Matt is probably very upset about his title being stripped, and his tiara.

292
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm the host.

293
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay, you guys can also be, you can be the official co-Jews.

294
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,920
Yes, they can be your, like, it's his yarmulke being stripped.

295
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
They can be your harem of Jews.

296
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
I don't know what you would call that.

297
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
They can be my posse.

298
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,360
All right, your posse.

299
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
And anyway, my chavahra.

300
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
That's it.

301
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,120
Anyway, so yeah, that happened, and it was really great, and then I had to go talk in

302
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
front of people on Friday.

303
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:19,080
But I played some Star Trek Online, and I had to go because Dan came home, and it was,

304
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,840
I don't know, I played a little bit, not a lot, just some.

305
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:31,640
And oh, oh, oh, oh, my anniversary was on Wednesday, my fifth anniversary, so Dan got

306
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,120
me this instead of a rose, so it was three ambitions.

307
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,520
And isn't that much better than a rose?

308
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,240
Yeah, he also wrote me a note that said, in fact, here it is, I'll put it up on the thing,

309
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
it's on my Facebook right now.

310
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,000
Sorry I didn't get you a rose, I thought you would like this more, I love you, D.

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Aww.

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
I'll take a picture and put it on the thing.

313
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
That's sweet.

314
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah.

315
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
You should gush about him while he's not here to defend himself, it's really cute.

316
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
Because, you know, he has to be a manly man when he's here on the show, but.

317
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,440
I wish Dan would stop leaving his underwear in the hall.

318
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,680
Okay, let's move on to Loki, how was your gaming week?

319
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:19,680
My gaming week was pretty slim, I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned, still fun.

320
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,720
And I played a few other things that I probably shouldn't be talking about, but I don't care,

321
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,840
because I'm not under any sort of NDA.

322
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:35,640
So I got my dev kit this week for the Xbox, you know, my Xbox 360 dev kit, and to be honest

323
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,720
it's not as exciting as I would have thought it would have been, because the network that

324
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,560
should not be named, that has partner in it, really only has Xbox Live Arcade games and

325
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,760
download content that they're testing, so there's a few games on there that haven't

326
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,740
really been leaked out for JTAG users and that kind of stuff, so I got to play a few

327
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,520
different Xbox Live Arcade games that aren't out yet, that are actually kind of cool.

328
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:14,640
So one of them that I played was Bonk, apparently they're remaking Bonk, from Bonk's Adventure,

329
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:22,120
the old TurboGrafx game, and it's okay, it's kind of done along the lines of how they did

330
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,080
the Hudson Adventure Island remake.

331
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,000
It's okay, but the one thing that they kind of took out of it that really made Bonk, Bonk,

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,640
is his giant head.

333
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,080
His head is now a little bit more proportioned to his body, which really sucks, because it

334
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,480
has the same type, like when you're climbing a wall before in Bonk's Adventure, he used

335
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
to use his teeth.

336
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,840
Well, in this, he's still biting the wall, but he also looks like he's climbing, so it

337
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,080
doesn't make any sense why he's biting the wall.

338
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,920
I don't remember a new Adventure Island game, was that on the Wii or something?

339
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
It was on the Wii.

340
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Huh.

341
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,080
It was, I think it was a WiiWare game.

342
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Nice.

343
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
But it wasn't very good.

344
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Oh, okay.

345
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
That's too bad.

346
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:11,360
And this one's kind of just okay, but I don't know, it looks like it might be pretty fun,

347
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,480
I didn't play a whole lot of it, just a few levels, but it's alright.

348
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,920
It's just, I really wish they'd left his head in, you know, really big, oh, they don't really

349
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,800
have to change too much, just use like, just clean up the sprites a little bit, and go

350
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
from there, I mean.

351
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,680
The last Adventure Island game I remember playing that I just absolutely loved was Super

352
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,560
Adventure Island on the Super Nintendo, I don't know if you guys ever played this game,

353
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,520
but I think one of the reasons I really loved that game was the soundtrack to that game

354
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,080
was amazing.

355
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,560
And it turns out Yuzo Koshiro was the guy that did the soundtrack for that, and if you

356
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,840
don't know him, he's done a lot of awesome game music.

357
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,280
He does like the Wangan, Midnight, Maximum Tune, a lot of those soundtracks.

358
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,880
I believe he did Actraiser, like yeah, he did the original Actraiser, Streets of Rage

359
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,120
2, Shinobi, I mean he's done so many like awesome soundtracks, so he's just, he's like

360
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,640
one of my favorite gaming musician guys.

361
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,340
Other things that I tried playing, Super Meat Boy was up there, but the version that they

362
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,440
have on Partner Net is broken, it doesn't go past the main menu because you can move

363
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,800
the cursor around on the menu, but no button that you press will actually allow you to

364
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,520
start the game, which kinda sucked, because I wanted to play that.

365
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,240
And then, what else did I play, there was one other game I played, it was a dancing

366
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,560
game that's coming out actually, yeah, Dance It's Your Stage, which we'll be talking about

367
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,680
coming out next week.

368
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,240
It's terrible, it's really, really bad, and I don't know, I'm not too familiar with the

369
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,080
game itself, but I think based off the music that I saw on there, and that guy looks like

370
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:03,480
a total douche, I believe it's, it says it's a port of a German Wii game, I think it's

371
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,320
based off of, yeah, it's based off of a TV show.

372
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,320
That's so strange that they're bringing it here then, does it have David Hasselhoff in

373
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,360
it then that you can dance to?

374
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,640
No, but the music though in it is just not good.

375
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
That's really the only thing that kinda sucks.

376
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,920
The gameplay itself isn't very good either because it's got two kind of, two areas where

377
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,720
I guess steps or directions will go down, but it's not like DDR or something where one

378
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,420
column's up, one column's down, etc.

379
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,640
It's mixed all over the place, and so you may have up in like the left column, then

380
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:50,760
up in the right column, and it gets really confusing when it's going really fast, and

381
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:58,560
then also the music's very, very, very, very terrible, so I really don't recommend picking

382
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,600
it up, not that many people probably would have next week anyways, but it is a terrible

383
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
game.

384
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,940
Very, very, very terrible game.

385
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,120
Is it bad?

386
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
It's very bad.

387
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
I wasn't sure.

388
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
It's terra-bad.

389
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
It's terra-bad.

390
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Terra-bad.

391
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
What else did I play?

392
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,680
Oh yeah, one other, I played a cave shooter game, and I'm gonna butcher the name, I believe

393
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,960
it was called like Guranji or something like that, I don't know, it's just from memory

394
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
there.

395
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,360
Anyways, it's your typical cave shooter games, really, I guess, I don't really know the premise

396
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,040
of it because it was all in Japanese, but you can control kind of like a god deity thing

397
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,120
that's helping you out, and I don't know, it's just like all the other cave shmup games,

398
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,440
but that'll become the Xbox Live Arcade in Japan very soon I believe.

399
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
Not sure about over here.

400
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Hopefully over here though.

401
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Awesome.

402
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
That's fun.

403
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Alright, that it?

404
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Piggy mooing?

405
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
That is it.

406
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm gonna be looking forward to your sneak peeks every week now of new stuff coming out

407
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
until you get shut down.

408
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,720
Yeah, until the console gets banned off, banned off PartnerNet.

409
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,200
Not that, usually when they would ban the consoles it's not, it's actually worse than

410
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,520
like if you got banned off live because when they ban your console they blow all the e-fuses

411
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,640
and it makes your console very broken.

412
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Wow.

413
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
But.

414
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
That's kind of evil.

415
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,680
But the person that sold me the console took out the resistor that allows, you know, those

416
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,280
e-fuses to be blown, so if they ban me from PartnerNet, the console will be just fine.

417
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,920
That's kind of, that's like Mission Impossible where it's like this message will self-destruct

418
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
in 30 seconds.

419
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,680
Yeah, but here's the thing, you know, it's, if I got banned from PartnerNet I probably

420
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,680
wouldn't care because here I thought there was gonna be like, you know, actual beta tests

421
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,220
of games and stuff like that.

422
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
That's not the case.

423
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,100
And I could definitely see why they don't do that because people would be leaking that

424
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,680
crap left and right and even still with some of the arcade games people leak them out there

425
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,960
and you know, that's got to suck for them, but I don't know.

426
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
There's some neat stuff on there.

427
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,820
The whole fall lineup of stuff that we'll probably be covering later on is up there.

428
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
So some of it's pretty cool.

429
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,400
I played a little bit of Comic Jumper.

430
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,560
That was kind of neat, but really, really briefly checked it out, so.

431
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
All right.

432
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,800
Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangetonstrady.com, the always present fourth guest on the show,

433
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,080
although we really have like five people in the studio tonight, but who's counting?

434
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,320
Chat.orangetonstrady.com is where you can share your comments and we'll read them here

435
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
on air.

436
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,440
We'll start off tonight the marathon with a comment from Spazinator who is talking about

437
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,840
the soundtracks because I was talking about Yuzuru Koshiro a little bit ago, says, in

438
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,480
my opinion, the OSTs for Killer Instinct, Actraiser, Super Castlevania IV, and Mr. Bones

439
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,040
have the best music.

440
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,680
Those are all some really good soundtracks, although I don't know Mr. Bones.

441
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
What system was that on?

442
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
Is that PSN or something?

443
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:06,600
I think it was a PS3 and or a PSP game, but I know it came out on one of the Sony systems.

444
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,040
It was the skeleton guy.

445
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Oh, okay.

446
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
You remember?

447
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Well, hence the name Mr. Bones.

448
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Yeah.

449
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
I think I might have it somewhere.

450
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Okay.

451
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,880
The Killer Cuts CD that you got when you pre-ordered Killer Instinct on SNES was amazing.

452
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Yes it was.

453
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
Hours and hours played in high school.

454
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,240
It wasn't necessarily a pre-order either.

455
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,000
I just went into Montgomery Wards back in the day and bought mine and I said, where's

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
my CD?

457
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,880
Nice.

458
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,880
I would say one of my favorites was not actually from the game at all, but was the soundtrack

459
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,880
to the Mortal Kombat motion picture because that CD was awesome.

460
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,280
Mortal Kombat.

461
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Test your mind.

462
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,360
I have that song somewhere off the plate on break.

463
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
All right.

464
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
Anyway, let's move on to my gaming week.

465
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I'll talk quickly about this.

466
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,120
Now, was that the Mortal Kombat game soundtrack?

467
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,440
No, the actual movie soundtrack was awesome.

468
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,480
Yeah, the Mortal movie soundtrack was awesome, but remember the one that they did for the

469
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
game?

470
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Less awesome.

471
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Oh, come on.

472
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
That was very awesome.

473
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
It was so awesome.

474
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,000
We used to play Keys or That soundtrack.

475
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,920
And Spaznator is clarifying in chat that Mr. Bones was a Sega Saturn game.

476
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
That was it.

477
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Are you thinking about the Ghosts and Goblins kind of game that was on...

478
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Nevermind.

479
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,280
Let's see.

480
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,040
We got a lot of other comments in chats here.

481
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Oh.

482
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
What?

483
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Sorry.

484
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I was going to add one more thing to my gaming week.

485
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,560
It's not really my gaming week yet, but it will be.

487
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:36,520
Unless you haven't read my Twitter, I will be getting an iPod touch.

488
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,800
Now, I know what you're thinking, this goes against my total hatred of Macs.

489
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Wrong.

490
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,160
And really Apple in general.

491
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,720
Well, I kind of gotten blinded by the whole hating Macs because iPods are not Macs.

492
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
iPods are their own thing.

493
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
They're actually...

494
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,720
Sure, rationalize it however you can, Loki.

495
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,640
It's the backpedal express.

496
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Choo choo.

497
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,720
To be fair, I didn't pay for this with my own money, so...

498
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
I think that's what it really is.

499
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,640
If he's being given them, how can he say no?

500
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,280
I mean, they are still great MP3 players and stuff.

501
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,200
No, I think they're decent MP3s.

502
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,280
Well, I don't really give a crap about playing MP3s, but...

503
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,800
Other game systems now, too, really.

504
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Yeah.

505
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,960
But, you know, if they gave me the gift card and said you have to spend it on a Mac computer,

506
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
I think I'd have issues, but...

507
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm fine with the new iPod.

508
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,000
But you're not going to be pre-ordering the Apple TV anytime soon.

509
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, fuck no.

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't care.

511
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,920
Because there was a big Apple thing this week, and it actually involved gaming.

512
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,480
We'll get into that a little later, and we'll get more of Loki's thoughts at that point.

513
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,560
I want to read some more comments from chat, because chat is talking about other gaming

514
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
soundtracks.

515
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Haseo Sumiragawa, I hope I said that right, says Final Fantasy X soundtrack for the win.

516
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,760
And let's see, Redertainment says the music from Brutal Legend was awesome.

517
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,420
Too bad they never released a formal original soundtrack for that game.

518
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:04,120
And then Cyberbeast, I love this, chimes in with, Daytona.

519
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,600
You know what game actually had, well, one of the little side soundtracks that they did

520
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,200
was Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon.

521
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Oh yeah.

522
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
Those were both gorgeous arrangements of the music.

523
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,720
Was Prey the one that was all piano?

524
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
Because there's one where all the songs were piano.

525
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,240
It was the lady singing.

526
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Okay.

527
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Well, there's a third.

528
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,280
It had a lot that was on piano, but Celtic Moon was all the, you know, Celtic style.

529
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Right, right.

530
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Good stuff.

531
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Yeah.

532
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
All right.

533
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
All right.

534
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
We'll be keeping an eye on chat throughout the night.

535
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Chat at orangesongsradio.com.

536
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,080
Amaysatsuma says, Loki, your soul is mine.

537
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Love, Steve Jobs.

538
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
There you go.

539
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,320
I haven't spent the gift card on something.

540
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,400
It was either that or, like, a bunch of the nanos.

541
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,720
And what the hell would I do with a bunch of nanos or a bunch of the shuffles or whatever?

542
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,560
Well, I was telling Loki that here in California, there's actually a state law.

543
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,940
A lot of people don't know this.

544
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,480
But if you get a gift card, like, let's say somebody gives you a target card, or no, I

545
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
got one that's a lot more practical.

546
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,560
Somebody gives you a Walmart card for Christmas, and it's like, you know, 50 bucks or what

547
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
have you.

548
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,360
And you're like, ew, I don't like Walmart.

549
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm not going to shop at Walmart ever.

550
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,240
You can actually take that gift card in and get the cash value of the card back.

551
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
There's actually a law in the books here.

552
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,320
I don't know what other states have that, but it's here.

553
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,040
But what a lot of companies do sometimes is that if they're buying these cards in bulk,

554
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,600
then there's a discount on them.

555
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,520
Like, you know, if a company buys $55 Starbucks cards to give away as an incentive, they might

556
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,240
reduce the cost of that.

557
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,920
So that way they have no cash value.

558
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
They're not really gift cards.

559
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,660
They're like coupons.

560
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,680
And so then you can't do that.

561
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,960
So it really depends if someone paid full cash value up front or not.

562
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Yeah.

563
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
So.

564
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
All right.

565
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
And Zebo wants to know how you got the gift card.

566
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
What did you do?

567
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Was it a present?

568
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I don't know if you can talk about it.

569
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
No, I can talk about it.

570
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,760
It's not really anything I did.

571
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,160
It's actually what our video reps did.

572
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,840
Our video reps, they do sales incentives with Sony for various titles throughout the year.

573
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
And we've gotten a bunch of things actually from Sony and thankfully they do include us

574
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,200
game reps, even though we have nothing to do with this in on the little spiff.

575
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,960
So like, for example, we've gotten a Sony HDTV.

576
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,760
We've gotten a surround sound system, a camcorder, and they got a PlayStation 3.

577
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,080
I wasn't included on that, but don't care, I already have one.

578
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,920
And then we're going to be getting probably later on this year a Sony style card for $500.

579
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,480
So they actually gave us a $500 card for Apple.

580
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,920
Apparently they just said, eh, screw it, we don't care about the PSP, you know.

581
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
We give up.

582
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Buy Apple.

583
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
You know?

584
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
So I think they're just trying to mix it up.

585
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,840
Tiara suggested that you could buy a bunch of shuffles and throw them like ninja stars.

586
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,920
No, I decided, because I'm nice and a wonderful husband and stuff, I bought myself an iPod.

587
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,600
The new iPod touch, eight gig, one for myself and one for my wife.

588
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
To which she's like, what am I going to do with that?

589
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,560
I'm like, God, I should have just spent it.

590
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,840
Put Bejeweled on it for her.

591
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,600
I was going, she doesn't care.

592
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,800
She's like, I can play Bejeweled online.

593
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,320
And she, you know, I'm like, well, you can browse the internet with that.

594
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,920
Well, can I just browse the internet anywhere or do I have to be on wifi?

595
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,360
Well, you have to be on wifi.

596
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Well, that's stupid.

597
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,200
I'll just use my computer here.

598
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Does Apple make diapers?

599
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,920
Because we could use those right now.

600
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,400
You should, you should sell it and get the money so we can put it in our savings account.

601
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,240
That's always the answer for stuff.

602
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,760
So you know, the next time, like when we get that Sony style card, she isn't getting shit.

603
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
That's all mine.

604
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,880
Then again, though, I don't know what the hell I'd get from Sony style for $500 because

605
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,720
Nelly sounds like my mother.

606
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,240
It's just her Jewiness, I guess.

607
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh, wait, wait.

608
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,360
Dark soccer can officially be offended by that now.

609
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,760
I'm not offended.

610
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,160
She will just, she will just become more frugal.

611
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
That's yeah.

612
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Yes.

613
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm well aware.

614
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Robot unicorn attack is on the app store.

615
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
I was just going to read that comment for Jay Dizzle and Jeff.

616
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,920
I will probably be downloading it.

617
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Actually.

618
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
I want to download Mirror's Edge because that looks pretty awesome.

619
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I have it on my phone.

620
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
If you want to look at it.

621
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
No.

622
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
The robot unicorn attack.

623
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
All right.

624
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Anyway.

625
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Look, he's like, I don't care.

626
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
I don't care.

627
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
All right.

628
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Let me talk about my gaming week.

629
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Um, my gaming week.

630
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
I actually didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

631
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Most of the same old, same old.

632
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,160
I will talk about one new thing I played.

633
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
I got to, uh, get a sneak peek at something.

634
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Just like, look, he did.

635
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,120
I got to play World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the beta for that, uh, at least for a little

636
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
bit.

637
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,240
It worked for like a morning and then I couldn't get in all day yesterday.

638
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,640
So, um, Alan watched me play this too.

639
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
It was cool.

640
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I rolled a Worgen and leveled it through about the first six levels and Worgen are very,

641
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,320
they seem really cool to me.

642
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,120
Like I, I think that the Blizzard went all out making their new, uh, race is pretty cool

643
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,120
because the Worgen, you know, they're all kind of like British people.

644
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,880
They all, they all talk like British people and you know, have the accents and everything.

645
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,920
And then it's just awesome because like right when you start it, like werewolves are attacking

646
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,840
and they're all over and it actually feels like a really bad like horror movie or something.

647
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
I don't know.

648
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
It was cool.

649
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
But yeah, go ahead.

650
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,800
I'll say, well, Gilneas is very Victorian, very 1800s and when, uh, Rob found a female

651
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,720
MPC and clicked on her, she said something and he's like, oh, they sound like the Spice

652
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Girls.

653
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Yes, they do.

654
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,160
So, uh, you know, I was, I was having fun with that and I leveled through about six

655
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,460
levels and I actually got to the part where you get, you actually turn into a werewolf,

656
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,940
but it's so great because in the beta right now it actually says there will be a movie

657
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,440
here where you transform into a Worgen and then it just warps you to the post movie place,

658
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
which I thought was really cool.

659
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,040
But there's just some awesome quests.

660
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,640
Like they're really starting to ramp up some of the quests.

661
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,760
Like let me tell you what my favorite quest I did was one where you have to go around

662
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,980
and you collect barrels and when you collect the barrels and you have to walk up to the

663
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:51,560
giant fat abomination creatures and you put the barrel on its head and then your character

664
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,920
will yell fire and then the camera zooms back in a seamless motion and it goes back up to

665
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,160
where you started the quest and there's a guy there with a gun and it shows him aiming

666
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,600
it at the barrel and pulling the trigger and you watch the bullet fly with the camera and

667
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,080
it hits the bullet and the abomination is saying something like, oh, me worried.

668
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,480
And then the bullet hits the barrel, which is filled with gunpowder and the dude explodes

669
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
and chunks go everywhere.

670
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
It's awesome.

671
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
And I was like, it sounds like fun.

672
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
It's getting hardcore.

673
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm liking this stuff.

674
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,720
So and apparently I didn't play the goblin area yet, but apparently they have like a

675
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,760
highway through the goblin town and there's like all these like car racing, Mario Kart

676
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,980
type quests.

677
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,080
So they're getting crazy with all the different quests they have in the games.

678
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,600
I've heard it called Grand Theft Azshara because of all the little cars.

679
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
That's awesome.

680
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
So yeah, I know the, the crack is, is, is saying your name, dark Sakura.

681
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,440
I actually, I was just thinking that something that would be fun is if I play Sims all throughout

682
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,760
the show and have a house built by the end of the show, if you want, if you want to go

683
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,480
or started at five or I'll log into Star Trek online.

684
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
All right.

685
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
No, no, no, no, no.

686
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I wouldn't do that.

687
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
I don't know.

688
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,560
Honestly guys, I don't know what we're going to do once the regular show is over.

689
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,040
We're going to fill seven hours of radio somehow.

690
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
We'll figure it out.

691
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
We get there.

692
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,840
Uh, but that was really the only new thing I played this week was, was the cataclysm

693
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
beta.

694
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
That was one of the new 80 stuff.

695
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,760
Cause like I said, I played it once and I was waiting for my character to copy over

696
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
and it wasn't there yet.

697
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,160
And then I wasn't able to get back in.

698
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,440
I don't know if there's a problem with my account or what's going on.

699
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,040
So I'll just have to figure it out later.

700
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,200
So, uh, but yeah, Worgen thumbs up for me, that was a fun little opening quest.

701
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,480
I always like it and to see some of this new stuff, but I gotta be careful how much of

702
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,200
it I play because I don't want to ruin the actual release.

703
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,040
But luckily a lot of it is still really janky.

704
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,920
Like there's missing textures in some places and you know, a lot of like odd things, you

705
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,080
know, so the, the full release will still be good.

706
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Speaking of janky, um, did, uh, the final fantasy 11 or not 11, might as well be 11

707
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
cause it sucks.

708
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Uh, no, the final fantasy 14 beta, the open beta start this week.

709
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
I don't remember.

710
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,580
Sort of, but a lot of people are having problems getting in.

711
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,240
I guess you have to actually register for the open beta and they're only letting so

712
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,720
many people in at a time.

713
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
That's not closed beta.

714
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
That's stupid.

715
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
I'm hearing they're having a lot of problems.

716
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,000
It's either limiting the amount of people that can play the beta, just like the time.

717
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,360
I got an email inviting me to the open beta and I saw like the next morning or whatever

718
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,840
and I didn't bother signing up for it cause I don't care.

719
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,160
But on my Facebook, a lot of people, I guess they've got the same email and we're saying

720
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,440
that once you click through on the email, it was only open for like an hour of signups

721
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
and then they reclosed it.

722
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
So it's.

723
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Yeah.

724
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
Yeah.

725
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
That games, that games in a lot of trouble.

726
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Uh, I'm, I'm worried they, they, they really, if they're smart, they're going to push back

727
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,600
the release of that game and not try to release it.

728
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,920
But it might be too late now.

729
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I don't know.

730
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,720
Uh, but also speaking of release dates, playing this world of Warcraft beta got me thinking.

731
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,660
I don't think it's coming out this year.

732
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,720
Like I know Blizzard has swore up and down that they're going to try and get it out this

733
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
year.

734
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,060
Uh, if they make this year, mid December is like the earliest you're going to see this

735
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
game.

736
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,260
It'll be out before Christmas.

737
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
It's going to be mid December.

738
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,800
Then it had like you when you say before Christmas, you mean like two weeks before before Christmas

739
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,160
because they've already sent out a map notice, um, saying that their map, um, stuff's ending

740
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
on the 25th.

741
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Really?

742
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,640
I feel like there's a lot left still of, um, I mean, that can change it doesn't really

743
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,760
matter that they sent out that notice, but I'm just saying that right now that's what

744
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,280
they're saying is that it's going to be out before Christmas.

745
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,920
Well, they're probably waiting to announce the actual release date at Blizzcon, but I'm,

746
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,080
I'm thinking mid December because there's still all this stuff they got to do.

747
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,460
They've got to do the actual patch for Cataclysm, which will probably be about three weeks before

748
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,920
the game releases.

749
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,360
They've got to do the world event that leads up to the Cataclysm, which is a good, you

750
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,960
know, another three weeks.

751
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,160
They've got to do one more patch still of the taking of Nomur, Nomurgan and, uh, Echo

752
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Islands.

753
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,460
You know, that still has to happen too.

754
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,640
So there's still a good 10 weeks of plot content that has to happen before the game can come

755
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
out.

756
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,040
So there's only so much time left, so we'll see.

757
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
All right.

758
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,800
Um, let's move on to our guests and their gaming weeks.

759
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,760
Uh, Alan, how was your gaming week?

760
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
Um, pretty boring.

761
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
Same old, same old, uh, maybe an hour or two of Zuma's Revenge.

762
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
Revisited that.

763
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
A lot of fun.

764
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,040
And then just a lot of wow.

765
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
No real developments there.

766
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,240
What's your big wow accomplishments lately?

767
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,040
Um, I got enough rep with the Oracles to buy their stupid egg that hatches once a week

768
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,480
to try and get the mount from it.

769
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
That's about it.

770
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Good times.

771
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Very boring.

772
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Good times.

773
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
All right.

774
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,000
Any other games that you like to play regularly outside of wow, just so the listeners don't

775
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,440
think you play wow all time, all the day, although that may be what you actually do.

776
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
That's really it.

777
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
That's it.

778
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Yeah.

779
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Come on.

780
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Puzzle Quest 2.

781
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
I've talked about that before.

782
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Um, Zuma's Revenge.

783
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,360
Like I just said, I played Peggle on your phone, your new iPhone 4 that we got last

784
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
week.

785
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Peggle is crack.

786
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Yeah.

787
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Peggle is really awesome.

788
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
All right.

789
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,960
Um, some of our listeners are saying the stream is skipping.

790
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,280
I don't know what's going on, but, uh, with a 12 hour show, I'm sure it's going

791
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,040
to be a problem through a lot of it, but just to remind everybody in studio, whatever bandwidth

792
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
you got to make sure.

793
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,600
I did forget to close my torrents, so I just closed them.

794
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Uh ohs.

795
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Okay.

796
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
There you go.

797
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
All right.

798
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Maybe that'll help.

799
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
So we'll see.

800
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,160
Um, if it still is skipping in about 10 minutes, I'll try rebooted the stream.

801
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,400
But meanwhile, I think I kind of asked Bradley about his game a week and he said he was doing

802
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,320
mostly traveling, but I'll ask again if there's anything you want to throw out there, Bradley.

803
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Okay.

804
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,440
So there was no games this week, but I want to go with my last week because I was playing

805
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,640
a bunch of games then I played, uh, played the shadow complex that was, that's a fun

806
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
game.

807
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,120
That was for last year's summer arcade.

808
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,320
I've actually bought all the ones for this year, even though just mainly because I bought

809
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
the four of them.

810
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,120
So I bought Monday night combat as well.

811
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,240
I played through the demo and it's a game I probably might pay a little bit, but it's

812
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,200
not one I'd play a lot because one of those team based combat games I'm not a big on,

813
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,800
but, uh, uh, Castlevania HD, I didn't play that last week, but I've played through the,

814
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
through the game on that.

815
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
And that's fun.

816
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,760
It's, it's kind of one thing that, yeah, as you said on one of the previous podcasts was

817
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,600
that, uh, it was kind of weird because it's like you have a 30 minute time limit limit

818
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,880
to find the boss and get it done.

819
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,160
And that, that, that makes it kind of difficult because if you screw up somewhere like 22,

820
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,280
like you're 29 minutes in, you're trying to kill the boss and you run out of time, you

821
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,560
have to do the whole level again.

822
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,400
So that kind of makes it hard for a one player when you do the single player.

823
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,880
Plus it's sometimes hard to find the damn boss.

824
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,920
Like I get lost in those maps, like, because they change every game somehow like little

825
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
doors move or something.

826
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,600
I think it's a pain.

827
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,960
Well, that's sort of the way they deal with the HD where you change the, you can change

828
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
the size of the map.

829
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,800
You can zoom out and kind of look at, look at your map and, uh, cause some things open

830
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,400
certain doors and once you learn the pattern and you can do it, but that's, that's how

831
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
you do that one.

832
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,840
Uh, uh, let's see what the other, other games, uh, limbo, that one's, that one's actually

833
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,480
a pretty cool game.

834
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,520
It's at least it's, it's worth a play.

835
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,160
It's if it's cause it's a, it might be a bit expensive for the $15 just cause it's, if

836
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,280
the first playthrough of it, it only took me about three and a half hours.

837
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,600
And if, once you learn the puzzles, it only takes about, it's only an hour game, but it's

838
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,480
definitely worth playing cause it's, cause it's really atmospheric and a pretty, some

839
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,720
pretty cool like sort of, uh, scenes in the game, like the hotel sign that's kind of charging

840
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,240
on and off with, uh, this, with, uh, with, uh, the electricity.

841
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,280
So if you jump at the wrong time, you'll get, you'll get electrocuted as like really pretty

842
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,600
cool sounds to it.

843
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:36,120
Uh, also, uh, cause Hydro Thunder, Thunder Hurricane, that's fun and kind of fun playing

844
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
online.

845
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,280
They're, they're online service.

846
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,480
The online like game thing is kind of, there's sort of a little bit screwy that if you find

847
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,280
you're in a match and you, and you get kicked out of it or, or if it's, you don't want to

848
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,160
play that one, you have to go back to the beginning, to the menu and then reload it.

849
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,520
That's kind of the only bad thing about that one.

850
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,040
Uh, let's see what the other, the other game in there, uh, Lara Croft and the Guardian

851
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
of Light.

852
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Yeah.

853
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Yeah.

854
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
I did play that.

855
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I played like through the first four levels.

856
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
That's pretty fun.

857
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
I haven't played the co-op because I don't have, I haven't had a second person there

858
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,160
to play it, but it sounds interesting from what you said last week or two weeks ago,

859
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
I think.

860
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Yeah.

861
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
I was definitely a fan boy for that game.

862
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I'm not even going to lie.

863
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,240
That was, it was kind of one of those like surprises.

864
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Like I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.

865
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
I really wasn't.

866
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
So that was, it was cool.

867
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,920
I like the arcade feel that game a lot.

868
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,880
Feels like, it feels like playing gauntlet kind of.

869
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah.

870
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
It's cool.

871
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Yeah.

872
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
And also played a burnout revenge.

873
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,840
I had been like a year, like almost like nine or eight, 10 months since I played it last,

874
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:39,000
but I like the burnout games as they're, that's like arcade, like the racing simulator, simulators,

875
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,920
but arcade racing, just fun knocking people off the road and trying to get the thing except

876
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,080
for like the burning laps and the, and like preview races where you have to beat a certain

877
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,560
time are really annoying because if you die, if you mess up one time, you have to restart

878
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,520
the whole race and start over and over.

879
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,680
It takes like an hour to get a gold on it or perfect rating on it.

880
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,240
All right.

881
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,200
Um, well, um, I guess that's going to do it for everybody's gaming weeks.

882
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,560
So you all right over there?

883
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,120
Crash knocked my fork over.

884
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,160
I, it was my delicious food, which I'm not going to describe.

885
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,560
It's still very garlicky.

886
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
All right.

887
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Nothing wrong with garlic.

888
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
All right.

889
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,880
Let's move into some gaming news after we do some housekeeping tonight.

890
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,480
I don't have a whole lot to add other than the, we already talked about, we're going

891
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,800
to be going a long, long, long show tonight.

892
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,360
Um, I'm trying to see if the skipping problems resolved.

893
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,960
Looks like some people are saying, yeah, it's better.

894
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Some are saying it's still going, so we'll see, we'll give it a few more minutes to work

895
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
itself out.

896
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,400
Um, and otherwise I guess I'll say add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and on

897
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,080
Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

898
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,920
If you follow us on there, we can give you updates so that you know, if we're going to

899
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,480
be doing a show early or whatever's going on.

900
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,520
Uh, all right, let's get into some news.

901
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,640
Let's finally start talking some actual gaming news here today.

902
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,240
Big news out of penny arcade expo, right?

903
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Loki.

904
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Oh yeah.

905
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,880
This is kind of like a very surprising news, but you know, probably I'm sure people are

906
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,240
taking it with a grain of salt.

907
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:11,580
Duke Nukem forever is coming out 2011 on Xbox 360 PlayStation three and PC, um, is now being

908
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,480
developed by gearbox, um, software with the help of a two K games.

909
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:25,360
And uh, they are finishing with 3d realms took over 10 years to, uh, start I guess.

910
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:32,240
And uh, it was playable on the show floor and um, it's everything Duke Nukem should

911
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,840
be, you know, with, uh, you know, being able to pee everywhere and you know, blowjob into

912
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:45,640
windows and, um, you know, are there strippers punching eyeballs across, you know, a football

913
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
field.

914
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Good stuff.

915
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,240
All right, here, here's where I want to start is this is obviously yay, funny gaming news,

916
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,440
you know, like hooray, it's finally happening, but at the same time, there's a part of me

917
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,840
that goes, okay, well look, I don't think this is really the same game that Duke Nukem

918
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,480
forever was, was originally going to be.

919
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,040
And um, you know, that might be kind of a duh because it's probably been like five different

920
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,580
games over the past 13 years or however long it's been, but, um, I honestly think after

921
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:21,600
the closure of 3d realms, I think these guys probably got the IP and probably nuked everything

922
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
that had happened before.

923
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,960
I mean, I know they say that they've taken what 3d realm started or whatever, but I go,

924
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,400
they took an idea probably, or they took the idea of what Duke Nukem should be and have

925
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,760
just kind of run with it and made it their own.

926
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,880
That's, that's kind of what I think this game really is.

927
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,440
And it's like, let's give it to a developer who's not going to take 13 years to finish

928
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
it.

929
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,200
It's as though they've been working on since late 2009 and says, uh, we're in the Paul's

930
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,640
Sheen phase right now.

931
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,680
This game, this is a game where we cannot make a promise.

932
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,240
We cannot fulfill, uh, we need to get past the shock and awe and then we can go to all

933
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,040
the retailers and first parties and work with our launch plan.

934
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,560
So it will be coming out though.

935
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,400
Um, I'm excited.

936
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,120
I love the Duke Nukem games and to be honest, just the screenshots and the like the little

937
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,080
cam videos that they had of the gameplay, it looks good.

938
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,440
It looks like, you know, cause I think they're really going to kind of keep the vibe of the

939
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,640
old games in there and it's just going to be souped up now and gearbox, you know, they've

940
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,480
definitely got a good pedigree as far as first person shooters go.

941
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,080
So I'm pretty confident that they'll churn out a good game.

942
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Awesome.

943
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Uh, multiplayer.

944
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,520
They're not really showing a lot of that.

945
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,240
There will be good multiplayer though if gearbox is involved.

946
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,400
I hope they do like map editing and all that stuff.

947
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Although I hope so.

948
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,760
It's kind of hard to do.

949
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,280
I was some of the most fun part of the original Duke Nukem is looking at all those custom

950
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,520
max maps that would come out for that.

951
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,280
Maybe the PC version, but I don't know about the, um, three 16 PS three, uh, go to our

952
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,440
chat room chat, that orange sounds radio.com spazzinator says Duke Nukem forever coming

953
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
out.

954
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Sky did hell freeze over.

955
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
What's next?

956
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,720
Super bowl, uh, D blue guy says DNF is coming out.

957
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,560
Next thing you know, valve might actually talk about episode three.

958
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Perish the thought.

959
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
I don't know about that.

960
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,080
I know that's a topic near and dear to your heart, Alan, right?

961
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,680
Quaking with rage right now.

962
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Yes.

963
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,120
Once, once portal two is out, their next press release better have half life in it.

964
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,000
All right, we'll see.

965
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
All right.

966
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,520
Uh, let's move on to another topic.

967
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,760
Uh, we'll know more about that game, I guess, closer to when it actually releases, which

968
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,240
it sounds like is actually going to happen at some point.

969
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
Hooray.

970
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,040
Uh, talking about another thing that's a float around out there.

971
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,280
I'm not sure if they're showing this at PAX, but I guess the news broke.

972
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,240
Um, I actually heard about it.

973
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,440
Thanks to the, um, GameStop managers conference.

974
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,280
They were showing this, which was the week before packs.

975
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,080
And I think a lot of the stuff that was at is at PAX now was probably at this conference

976
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,900
like the week before, but this was one of them and it has to do with the new Xbox three

977
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,400
60 controller.

978
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,560
It's a redesign of the Xbox three 60 wireless controller.

979
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
It's now going to be silver.

980
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,760
It kind of has this black, white, silver look to it, uh, with only the green being in the

981
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,620
lights for the Xbox logo.

982
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,120
That's really the only place they are.

983
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:18,960
Uh, otherwise the other big change to this, a new d-pad finally in America, they are fixing

984
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,880
the d-pad, but not only are they fixing it, it's, it's really different.

985
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
What they're doing.

986
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,160
It's a transforming d-pad.

987
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,400
What you can do, you can pop out the plus sign to have it just be the plus sign, or

988
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,000
you can actually have a whole little like kind of reverse analog stick, if you will,

989
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,280
like more of like a sunken hole type of controller, what it is now, basically kind of, yeah.

990
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,840
So you can, you can have one or the other, uh, by doing a little rotation with that.

991
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,080
Um, so if you want to play something like, you know, an old school street fighter game,

992
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,520
you can pop it out one way if you're playing like a, a shooter like Halo Reach, maybe you

993
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,280
want to do another way.

994
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,020
Here's the interesting thing about it though, right?

995
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,000
How much do you think this controller is going to cost?

996
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,960
Well, I already know the answer to that, so I can't say.

997
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
45.

998
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
45 says.

999
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
About-ish.

1000
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,960
About-ish.

1001
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,960
Here's the thing.

1002
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
It's $64.99 for this new controller.

1003
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,160
You know why?

1004
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,720
They're only selling it with the play and charge kit as a bundle, and it's a limited

1005
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,960
edition.

1006
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,520
And there's a part of me that kind of goes like, like looks in that, looks at that and

1007
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,080
goes, you little shits.

1008
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,320
Like you know your controller is a problem.

1009
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,960
You've known this for a long time.

1010
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,560
You've fixed it with limited releases, like some sort of tease, like time again in Europe.

1011
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,880
And now you think you're finally releasing something kind of a step beyond that here.

1012
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,260
You're going to gouge for it when it's like a problem in the first place.

1013
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,040
Like you suck.

1014
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,040
You're a dick.

1015
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,480
Whoever thought of this?

1016
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,560
I mean, I like the look to the controller though, even though it is a little weird that

1017
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,440
like the buttons are not that yellow, blue, red, green color.

1018
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,360
Yeah, that's going to be wonderful for, I don't know, players that are new and that

1019
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:14,400
they have like color, you know, little indicators and stuff on the screen that correspond to

1020
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
those buttons.

1021
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, the buttons don't have colors because they're black and white.

1022
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,600
Why even, why did they do that?

1023
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,120
That's just dumb.

1024
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,240
The only way that I would see that being acceptable is if they were like backlit with those actual

1025
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
colors.

1026
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,700
So it looks gray when it's turned off, but actually has colors shining through when you

1027
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,400
turn it on.

1028
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,960
But that's not the case with this.

1029
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,480
That's just them being dumb.

1030
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,480
Monty Boggs in our chat room says, I'm sure the only thing limited is the bundle and color.

1031
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,600
They will continue with the new D pad.

1032
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Hmm.

1033
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,800
I hope you're right on that.

1034
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
I don't know.

1035
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,840
They haven't really said on that though.

1036
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,560
Maybe this is a trial thing.

1037
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,500
This is a trick to get you to buy it right now for $65.

1038
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,220
So we'll see.

1039
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,520
They're trying to get you suckers on an impulse buy.

1040
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
That's what it is.

1041
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
I don't know.

1042
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
All right.

1043
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Uh, let's move on.

1044
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Dark soccer.

1045
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
What do you got for us?

1046
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,740
Well, in the realm of a PlayStation, it actually, uh, they were sending out a survey seeing

1047
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:21,180
if people would be interested in, um, having the, uh, a digital comic service, um, on the

1048
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,840
PS3 and not just on the PSP.

1049
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,160
And um, so I'm not sure if they're actually going to do that now, but I mean, it would

1050
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,840
be kind of neat being able to read my comics on the TV.

1051
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Although honestly I can just look at my digital comics on my computer and we have a computer

1052
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,260
hooked up to our TV in the front room.

1053
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,480
So big diff.

1054
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Um, I think nothing's really going to replace, you know, actually having paper in your hand

1055
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:51,960
and reading the comic and going, who pretty, you know, but for those that want it, it's

1056
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
available.

1057
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Well, good for them.

1058
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,220
I mean, if they want to use, if Sony wants to do it good for them, maybe they'll get

1059
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,280
something out of it.

1060
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,000
I don't know that it's going to be worth the expenditure.

1061
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,900
I read comics on my iPhone, you know, having it handheld.

1062
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,720
That's one thing, but yeah, those are a little more portable, you know?

1063
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,480
You don't have to take a book that you'd worry about ruining, you know?

1064
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,240
Oh, I'm at work right now and I want to read a comic.

1065
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,160
I mean, I'm not at work and want to read a comic.

1066
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,160
I'm on my lunch.

1067
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,520
Yeah, I'm on my lunch break and want to read a comic.

1068
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:28,840
I have my break sign up all day.

1069
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,320
I'm surprised you haven't brought this up in your comic podcast yet because that's you,

1070
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,680
you tape those, you taped a comic podcast this morning, right?

1071
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,160
Yeah, but we focus more on the comics themselves.

1072
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
I see.

1073
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
Where, where can they download that?

1074
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,080
I'll let you work in a cheap plug for your new old spinoff show.

1075
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,320
Infamous gamers.net is the site.

1076
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,760
It's no I, there's just an N. The letter N. Yeah, nice.

1077
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,000
And um, oh, it's actually just infamous.net.

1078
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

1079
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,960
It used to be infamous gamers.com.

1080
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,000
Um, but in the meantime though, you also can find easier links right now on our various

1081
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,420
Twitters and whatnot.

1082
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,420
Very cool.

1083
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,420
Yeah.

1084
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,420
All right.

1085
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,420
Thanks for your time.

1086
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,680
And you're totally a sucker for having done that already this morning.

1087
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,080
So you've already been broadcasting for an hour or two, right?

1088
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,680
We were Skype casting.

1089
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Skype casting.

1090
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
That works.

1091
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
That's how we do it is Skype.

1092
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
And when do your new episodes come out?

1093
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,680
Cause you tape today.

1094
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,520
And every so often we get Dalek voice.

1095
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,080
You tape today, but it'll come out what?

1096
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,080
Tomorrow?

1097
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,080
Tomorrow.

1098
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,080
Okay, very cool.

1099
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,960
So I've got, after we're done here, I've got editing to do.

1100
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Fun.

1101
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
Good luck with that.

1102
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,960
Uh, all right.

1103
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,960
All right.

1104
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,440
Moving on to more stories, Loki.

1105
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,440
So um, it's kind of funny, um, Medal of Honor, you know, a big game that's going to be coming

1106
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:50,040
out from ETH, um, EA this October, uh, is actually banned from military, um, bases.

1107
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,240
At least, uh, Gamestop's located in military, um, bases.

1108
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:03,960
Apparently, uh, this is a decision, I guess, um, by Gamestop and also with, um, I believe,

1109
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:12,920
uh, they said, uh, the PX commanding general, uh, was it the commanding general of the army

1110
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,480
and air forces exchange services, I guess I made the decision about that.

1111
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,180
Um, so it says Gamestop has agreed out of respect for our past and present men and women

1112
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,180
in uniform.

1113
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:30,160
We will not carry Medal of Honor in any of our AAFES based stores.

1114
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,360
At this time, it does not include our four stores on marine installations.

1115
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:43,320
Um, Gamestop fully supports the AAFES and in this endeavor and it's, and it is sensitive

1116
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:50,480
to the fact in multiplayer mode, uh, one side will assume the role of Taliban fighters.

1117
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,680
As such, Gamestop has agreed to, um, have all marketing materials pulled by noon today

1118
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:02,720
and stop taking reservations, customers who entered our AAFES stores and wish to reserve

1119
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,720
Medal of Honor, uh, can and should be directed to the nearest Gamestop location off base.

1120
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:14,760
Again, we appreciate the sensitivity and know, um, our AAFES based stores will continue to

1121
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:20,240
honor, um, the great customer base in which they serve.

1122
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,040
And of course that is because the Taliban are in multiplayer.

1123
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,640
Oh yes, because, you know, our soldiers can go and fight, you know, in Iraq and stuff

1124
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,360
like that, but oh my God, the Taliban's in a video game and then we're going to flip

1125
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,200
out because they can't handle that.

1126
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,920
It's dumb.

1127
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,920
That's just like saying we should remove all the Germans out of Call of Duty because, you

1128
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,280
know, they offended people in World War II and the Holocaust and stuff like that.

1129
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,620
You know, we should, uh, we should stop selling those games everywhere because people were

1130
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,320
affected by the Holocaust.

1131
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,320
I don't know.

1132
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,840
I would find it a little weird in the first place.

1133
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:05,920
I mean, not weird, but I would like when I'm not working, I don't want to like think about

1134
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
and do work, if that makes sense.

1135
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,840
Like, and I know Medal of Honor is fake.

1136
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,840
Okay.

1137
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,100
But still it's kind of like when you're working, you know, you're doing all this military stuff

1138
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:20,160
and then when you are off, you want to continue to do military stuff in a game.

1139
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,520
Like, don't you want to play like Mario Kart or something?

1140
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,520
Don't they understand?

1141
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:31,040
I understand that, you know, that the Taliban are, you know, not good people, but it's a

1142
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,040
video game.

1143
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,800
It'd be like, if you replace the Taliban with space aliens, it's still the opposing team.

1144
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
That's all it is.

1145
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
It's not real Taliban.

1146
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,160
When you play the game and kill people with the Taliban in there, it doesn't really kill

1147
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,680
real people in real life.

1148
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,680
Okay.

1149
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,680
It is a game.

1150
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:53,400
And if you're offended by that game, you know, then you don't have to buy it, you know.

1151
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,200
And besides, isn't that what you're fighting for, our freedom, you know, and the freedom

1152
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,200
of expression.

1153
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,200
I mean, this is kind of an art form, I guess.

1154
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,880
And if you're offended by it, well then don't buy it.

1155
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,880
Oil.

1156
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:12,240
Well, yeah, I understand it's oil as well, but I mean, there's still the fighting for

1157
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,880
freedom kind of crap because, you know, you're trying to save everybody from the terrorists.

1158
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,320
So I just, I don't understand what the big deal is.

1159
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,640
What's also interesting is that they're really not the first, you know, um, country U.S.

1160
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,360
to take issue with this because I think we had a story on the show last week, right,

1161
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,600
about the British had a problem with this game too.

1162
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,360
And we're talking about banning it, I think, in Britain completely with this.

1163
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Well, let me put it this way.

1164
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,900
GameStop is not the only store on those military bases.

1165
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,440
And you know, they may not be carrying it, but other stores will.

1166
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,900
So all that means to them is just lost sales.

1167
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,480
So have at it.

1168
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,160
Because you know what?

1169
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,520
I think most military people will not care.

1170
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,040
Redertainment in our chatroom kind of reiterates a point here.

1171
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,640
We also support the ability of people in the military to go off base and buy the game.

1172
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,360
Again, go off base and buy the game.

1173
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,160
So you know, it's not like the game is banned altogether.

1174
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,240
I mean, that would kind of be against the Constitution, but you know, they just, they

1175
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,640
don't have to support it, I suppose.

1176
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,500
So it's just something that they did because they think it's, you know, out of respect

1177
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,920
to those who serve, we will not be stocking this game.

1178
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,080
And they apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.

1179
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,640
But at the same time, they're like, well, just go off base and buy it.

1180
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,640
I don't understand.

1181
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,400
I don't understand what the big deal is then.

1182
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,280
If you were saying, oh, well, we don't want it on the base because that sets the wrong

1183
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,280
precedent.

1184
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,600
But you can buy it off base and bring it back in.

1185
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,600
That's fine.

1186
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,600
All right.

1187
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,640
Let's talk about something a little less serious than these types of games and talk about something

1188
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,720
a little more casual, shall we?

1189
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,700
This is also news that's coming out of Penny Arcade Expo.

1190
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,480
It's a brand new crossover game from Telltale Games.

1191
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,560
You might remember there was a teaser that I believe we brought up on the show last week.

1192
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:06,480
So let's see, if you could imagine, what would Homestar Runner, the guys from Penny Arcade,

1193
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,440
Sam and Max, and now Team Fortress 2 characters, what are they all going to do on their, in

1194
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,080
a new game together?

1195
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Plush it up?

1196
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Nope.

1197
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,520
They're going to play poker.

1198
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,000
That is the new game coming out from Telltale Games.

1199
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,600
It's a poker game.

1200
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,520
It's called Poker Night at the Inventory.

1201
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,360
It comes out for the PC and the Mac for only five bucks this fall.

1202
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,200
So at least it's, you know, kind of cheap.

1203
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,880
It's going to support Steamworks.

1204
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,000
That's why Team Fortress is now a part of this.

1205
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,960
It's going to be, you know, really integrating Steam and all that.

1206
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,800
They say there are, quote, more than a few surprises still in store.

1207
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,360
They are apparently showing off the game right now at PAX.

1208
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,000
They've got posters and all that good stuff.

1209
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,880
Dan Connors, the CEO of Telltale, quote, we've had the idea for some time of exploring the

1210
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,160
idea of what video game characters do when they're not on the clock in the games we play.

1211
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,520
We pitched the idea to friends in the industry and it really resonated.

1212
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,680
We all had a great time imagining what these guys would banter about while slinging cards

1213
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,080
from their Poker Night at the Inventory was born.

1214
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,880
So it sounds like this game is going to have a lot of smack talking in it, which might

1215
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,560
be kind of cool because like Homestar Runner talking shit will actually be really funny,

1216
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
I think.

1217
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,560
And some of these...

1218
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,920
I think you're a stupid poopy head.

1219
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,040
So we'll see.

1220
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,060
What I think is another thing to kind of draw out of that quote.

1221
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,400
We pitched the idea to friends in the industry.

1222
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:35,360
So they got this guy from Valve, the Team Fortress 2 dude is in here, as one of the

1223
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,800
playable characters.

1224
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,160
So my thought is, who else are they talking to?

1225
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,600
What other characters are going to show up?

1226
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,640
I bet some other big heavy hitter PC titles come into this too.

1227
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,140
I don't think it's just going to end here.

1228
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,700
There could be some other crossovers coming into this.

1229
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,700
So you know...

1230
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,560
Should have Shell just sitting there being quiet or Gordon Freeman sitting there being

1231
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,560
quiet.

1232
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,560
They're not supposed to say anything the whole time.

1233
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
You never know.

1234
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,560
Anything's possible.

1235
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,960
But they're not supposed to say anything.

1236
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
I don't know.

1237
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,440
Any other characters you guys think might fit in here?

1238
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,400
Hopefully some of the dudes from Back to the Future.

1239
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,400
C-Man.

1240
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,680
How about a velociraptor from the new Jurassic Park game?

1241
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,680
I think C-Man.

1242
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,680
C-Man?

1243
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,680
You know, when he's a frog.

1244
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
You should be C-Frog.

1245
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,400
I'm thinking more like PC oriented games, you know, because this is all about PC.

1246
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
GLaDOS.

1247
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,200
Oh, GLaDOS would be a good one.

1248
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,400
That would be a great one.

1249
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,800
All you have is the poker sphere.

1250
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,040
Um, maybe the chick from Mirror's Edge.

1251
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,400
I could see, you know, EA and Steam have a close relationship.

1252
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:37,440
And one of the unicorns from that stupid game on Steam.

1253
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,920
The pink honest game.

1254
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
Yeah.

1255
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
Yeah.

1256
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,560
Or what is, if you're talking PC, you know, how about an orc and a night elf?

1257
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,800
Although, you know, typically Blizzard doesn't do anything with Steam because they can do

1258
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
their own thing.

1259
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Or Rinky trying to swiddle everyone other money.

1260
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,960
Retertainment says Lady Gaga should just be a character in the poker game.

1261
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,760
Completely off topic, Rob.

1262
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,720
She can show her puh-puh-puh poker face.

1263
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,880
Did you see the link that I put up on Facebook?

1264
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,880
No.

1265
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,520
Someone making Para Para dances to Lady Gaga.

1266
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,240
Some people have too much time on their hands.

1267
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,440
It was actually kind of good, but I put it up there and you didn't even look.

1268
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,440
I'm sorry.

1269
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,440
When did you put it up?

1270
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,440
Yesterday.

1271
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,560
Well, I've been busy the past couple days.

1272
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,760
I was, I was busy sleeping yesterday.

1273
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,840
I'll have you know.

1274
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
You hoe.

1275
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Two naps.

1276
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Yeah.

1277
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
What's this, Alan?

1278
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,480
Rob took two naps yesterday.

1279
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Two two-hour naps.

1280
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,480
An old man.

1281
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,480
He's very cute.

1282
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,480
Shut up.

1283
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,480
Don't judge me.

1284
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,480
Oh, Jay Dizzle.

1285
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,480
Perfect answer.

1286
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Duke Nukem should be in the game.

1287
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
Hello?

1288
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
Because, you know, it's going to be a big release coming up.

1289
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
I like that answer.

1290
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
All right.

1291
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,120
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about more gaming news.

1292
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,640
These dates coming up in just a moment, but first, Dark Sakura has something for us.

1293
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,720
Mine's not really so much of a story, so much as an impression.

1294
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:00,800
The new screen caps for the Mortal Kombat game that's coming out are up and it looks

1295
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,800
really fun.

1296
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,080
You know, I was talking to somebody that was at the GameStop Managers Conference they were

1297
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,520
showing this game and I was hearing a lot of good things about it.

1298
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Here's my thing.

1299
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,360
I thought that the new Mortal Kombat game was supposed to be an arcade game.

1300
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,600
At least that was the impression I got when I first saw it, but like very much no at this

1301
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,600
point, right?

1302
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,800
It is definitely looking like a full $60 retail release, correct?

1303
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Yeah.

1304
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,800
That's what the word is.

1305
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,840
I mean, it's just, but I'm looking really at what I'm telling just from the images and

1306
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,520
it seems to me like, like there's this one scene in here with Katana, let me find her,

1307
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,280
where she's just covered in blood and it's fantastic.

1308
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:45,560
And you're like, and Melina has her horrible, ugly eat your face face and everything just

1309
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:52,600
looks like what Mortal Kombat used to be except for being, you know, 3D instead of being,

1310
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,920
you know, the motion cap.

1311
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,000
Like I'm not gonna lie, Mortal Kombat is one of those games that I really shouldn't like,

1312
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
but I do.

1313
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,520
Like, I really like the Mortal Kombat series and I'm really excited for this game.

1314
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,880
And I'm, you know what, there's just some guilty pleasure games and Mortal Kombat is

1315
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
one of them.

1316
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,160
To be fair, I didn't play the DC Universe game, but I played pretty much all the others.

1317
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,200
I really enjoyed the first couple, what was it, Deception and there was another one in

1318
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,200
there too.

1319
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,760
Not the last one they did with all the, thank you, Deadly Alliance.

1320
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,000
That was actually a decent game.

1321
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Deadly Alliance is awesome.

1322
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,880
I love the little RPG thing in there.

1323
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,200
Yeah, you know, even those mini modes, some of them were kind of stupid, like in Deception

1324
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,640
they had the kart racing and stuff, which were definitely an afterthought, but I ate

1325
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
that shit up.

1326
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,640
I thought it was awesome.

1327
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,920
I'm totally digging this particular level on this picture with the big colosseum.

1328
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,920
That looks cool.

1329
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,160
I have another one here that's inside of a clock tower.

1330
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,880
Oh, you know someone's getting thrown through that clock.

1331
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,600
Well, not just through the clock, I'm thinking that they're going to get ground up by the

1332
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
gears.

1333
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
Awesome.

1334
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,600
And that would be fantastic.

1335
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,160
I want there to be special stage fatalities for every stage.

1336
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
I hope so.

1337
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Because I want more blood.

1338
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,760
It sounds like these new IP owners, what Warner Brothers is taking care of this now after

1339
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,040
Midway, although a lot of the people that used to be involved are involved now, it really

1340
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,400
sounds like they're just like, okay.

1341
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,600
After that DC- They interviewed Ed Boon about it a few months

1342
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,600
ago.

1343
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,600
Yeah.

1344
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,600
After that DC Universe game, let's just give the fans what they want.

1345
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,840
Let's just go balls to the wall.

1346
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,240
We want like a Street Fighter 4-esque type of upgrade, like, cause you know, Street Fighter

1347
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,200
4 was like a fucking awesome upgrade from, you know, old school Street Fighter.

1348
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,880
So like, I think that's what they're going to give us with this new Mortal Kombat game.

1349
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,480
I'm looking at this red guy here and he's throwing the scorpion little chain thing.

1350
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,520
Is that Ermac, or is that the ninja from Deadly Alliance, whatever his name was?

1351
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,520
I can't remember his name.

1352
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,200
I don't know, but there's another thing that I wouldn't mind seeing.

1353
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
I think he's Ermac.

1354
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,680
You remember Soul Calibers create a fighter thing and that you can create certain ones

1355
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,800
that have actually a story to it?

1356
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,500
I think that would be- It's a little hit and miss with me because

1357
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,740
like in that one, the last Xbox game they did that let you do that, it was a little

1358
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,740
bit janky.

1359
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,400
Like it just was too much at that point.

1360
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,400
It was too much.

1361
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,120
It was just reptile, spitting, splashy, acid vomit.

1362
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,320
They do a pretty good job on the Soul Caliber games though.

1363
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,320
I will give you that.

1364
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,680
Like probably my second favorite series of fighting games behind Mortal Kombat, and yes,

1365
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,280
even above Street Fighter, is Soul Caliber.

1366
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,740
Like those games are really bad ass and I'm really waiting for news on Soul Caliber 5.

1367
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,560
Like I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, it's about time to hear about Soul Caliber

1368
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,400
5 because, you know, the Yoda and Darth Vader days have long passed.

1369
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,640
So I'd like to know what's up with that.

1370
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,600
Where's like the robot dude?

1371
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,600
Cyrax.

1372
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,640
So I like that they've pulled a lot of the stuff that people liked from the other series.

1373
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,120
I've actually got high hopes for this.

1374
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,680
For any of our friends though that are at PAX, I want to hear what you think about it.

1375
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,080
I'm liking that it looks like a lot of the roster from Mortal Kombat 3, except they kind

1376
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,820
of, at least so far, looks like they've said sia to a lot of the characters that just really

1377
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,200
weren't notable out of those games.

1378
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
Like Stryker.

1379
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
Like, you know, who- I liked him.

1380
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
Who played Stryker?

1381
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,200
Oh, come on.

1382
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
I did play him actually.

1383
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Oh, come on.

1384
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
He was-

1385
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,000
If you knew how to use him right, he was really, really awesome.

1386
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,960
And he had that particular- he had this like one punch combo that was super sweet.

1387
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,960
I will say-

1388
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,960
In Mortal Kombat 3.

1389
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,960
I loved Kabal.

1390
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,280
I did- I played Kabal.

1391
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,280
He was awesome.

1392
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,040
And I don't think he's really coming back because he wasn't really notable in the mythology-

1393
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,280
He had the run thing.

1394
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,920
Yeah, that was cheap.

1395
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,560
And I loved Sindel.

1396
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,560
I loved Sindel.

1397
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,480
Sindel was badass, but again, what was she really there to do?

1398
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,480
She was there to be the one dude's wife and then she kind of disappears.

1399
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,920
Like she didn't really- or no, she's Katana's mom though, isn't she?

1400
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
I think so.

1401
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,400
And the other one was the Goro chick.

1402
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,960
Yeah, she- I didn't care for her.

1403
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,960
What?

1404
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
Shiva.

1405
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,960
That was it.

1406
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,960
I didn't care for her.

1407
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
Like, oh, what a derivative name that is.

1408
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,960
Yeah.

1409
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,240
But I really like Sindel and her scream thing.

1410
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:03,560
But yeah, so I mean, and really, like I said, it's not exactly a story.

1411
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,040
And if anyone wants to see the images, just go to Eurogamer.net.

1412
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,840
But they're really- I'm actually excited about a Mortal Kombat game.

1413
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,120
Vidpower in our chatroom says, Striker is the Dan of the Mortal Kombat universe.

1414
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,360
Hey, if you can win a game with Dan, you're pretty awesome, right?

1415
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,480
Nice, I like that.

1416
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,620
Derek H. in our chatroom, by the way, I neglected to say this last week on the show, and I really

1417
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:31,620
need to give a big holler and thank you to Derek H. for the big battle which wrapped

1418
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,340
up last week.

1419
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,760
Even though we got our butts kicked by the host country, Dead Picks Alive, you know how

1420
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,840
that usually happens in the Olympics?

1421
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,400
The host country usually wins, and Dead Picks Alive won.

1422
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,440
We made a really good job second place, so thank you to all the listeners who helped

1423
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
out in the big battle there.

1424
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,000
And I just want to give kudos to Derek for putting that all together, because I know

1425
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,440
it's a pain in the ass to do those types of large-scale tournaments.

1426
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:58,360
Hence why we don't do them a lot anymore, so good job to him, appreciate it.

1427
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,780
He says in our chatroom, that's the defense of everyone who likes crappy characters.

1428
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,840
If you know how to use them, he's great.

1429
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,920
I do the same thing with Cammie.

1430
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,440
Cammie's actually a good character too.

1431
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,240
Uh-oh, Alan?

1432
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,240
Just like, his eyes got really big, and he's looking like, I'm gonna cut this bitch.

1433
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,240
Dan hates Cammie.

1434
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,240
Dan hates Cammie.

1435
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,240
Dan Jelly from the other room.

1436
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,880
Okay, so you like Cammie, right?

1437
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Yes, yes, she's amazing.

1438
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,920
And my favorite thing that she does is the little mid-air combos where she spins and

1439
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,920
then goes into a different kick or a punch or something.

1440
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,040
What were they called, the hooligan combos, I think?

1441
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,480
Here's my thing with Cammie.

1442
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,360
I like her as a character, and you know Kylie Minogue playing her in the movie was the best

1443
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,360
thing ever.

1444
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,920
That was the only good thing about the movie.

1445
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,280
Like I like her as a character, but as a street fighter, god I hate her.

1446
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,400
Like she's just, she's so useless.

1447
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,480
Actually no, I take that back, T-Hawk is probably the most useless street fighter.

1448
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,480
T-Hawk actually-

1449
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,240
She just has a nice ass, that's about it.

1450
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,400
They drew her with a nice ass.

1451
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,700
That's really the only addition to her.

1452
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,560
This is my thing.

1453
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,720
It doesn't matter how much someone says a character sucks, if you enjoy playing them

1454
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,280
and you're good at them, everybody else better watch out.

1455
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,740
That is the, that's the trash talking roots of the gaming universe, you know?

1456
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:17,960
What you believe to be true is law and everybody else is stupid.

1457
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,960
That's really what-

1458
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,400
And I think everybody can agree that she would probably look better naked than T-Hawk anyways,

1459
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,400
so yeah.

1460
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,080
T-Hawk would be disproportionate if he actually didn't have clothes on.

1461
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,080
Anyway.

1462
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
No penis.

1463
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:37,720
Anyway, but the whole, the whole point is, you know, it's just like with video games,

1464
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
you know?

1465
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,520
The game's only as good as the system, you know, they're on, well I mean, not the system

1466
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,520
they're on.

1467
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,520
A game-

1468
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,400
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1469
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,520
Well then a character is only as good as the player playing.

1470
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:56,040
Yeah, take my cami bashing with a grain of salt because I love Faye Long.

1471
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,080
Like he's my favorite character in Street Fighter.

1472
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,080
I think he's badass.

1473
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,920
I enjoy playing Sakura, but that's just because she's fun because she does her little hop

1474
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
thing.

1475
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
You playing Sakura?

1476
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,520
Karin was really good.

1477
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,680
One of my favorite characters in the Alpha series that made it into four that really

1478
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,280
just does not play well in four at all is Rose.

1479
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,320
She is amazing, but she's really hard to play and crap in four.

1480
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,320
But cami is awesome.

1481
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,240
I'll kick your ass as cami.

1482
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,600
I remember what my old Let's Piss Off Dan team was, was Gambit and cami.

1483
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,600
Good times.

1484
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,320
In X-Men vs. Street Fighter when we first got together.

1485
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,840
Can't wait for the new Marvel vs. Capcom game, it's gonna be good times.

1486
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Dan, look at the Saturn!

1487
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Alright.

1488
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,920
Alright, anyhow, let's move on to some release dates, traveling the world after our little

1489
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,640
fighting game derailment there, that's alright.

1490
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Let's travel the world and talk about-

1491
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,880
Hey, we've got time to fill.

1492
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,000
That's true, we do have lots of time to fill, although I know, I don't know what time Loki

1493
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,120
has to go, but we'll figure it out.

1494
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
So, release dates, Loki.

1495
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,880
Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.

1496
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:05,480
It's starting to ramp up a little bit because we're getting into the long fourth quarter.

1497
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:10,880
So starting things off, Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii and DS this week.

1498
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:17,320
Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and DS.

1499
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:23,480
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360.

1500
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,720
And the Wii version comes out later, if that's right.

1501
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:34,160
Oddly enough, if you really want to buy games before you can actually play them, there's

1502
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,680
some Playstation Move games coming out this week, including iPad.

1503
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:43,000
Unfortunately, since the Move doesn't come out for a couple weeks, you can stare at the

1504
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,480
nice little case for a while.

1505
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,040
That'll be available on Playstation 3.

1506
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:52,280
NHL 11 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360.

1507
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:58,400
Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allen Poe conspiracy on Nintendo DS.

1508
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,400
Kingdom Hearts.

1509
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:04,440
I will be buying that game, quote the raven, nevermore.

1510
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,000
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep coming out on the PSP.

1511
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
No PSP Go, though.

1512
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Do you want?

1513
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,240
NHL Slap Shot, that's the crappy Wii game with the hockey stick controller.

1514
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,320
Yeah, you're not going to break a TV with that.

1515
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
Sports Champions.

1516
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,320
That's the fun part.

1517
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:27,840
When you're at your friend's house and he beats you in NHL, whatever, whatever, and

1518
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,920
he's like, yeah, hi, beat you, you suck.

1519
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,620
You can just start bashing the TV in with your controller saying, huh, well I fucked

1520
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,280
up your TV, later, bitch.

1521
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,840
Sports Champions, the Wii Sports type game for the Playstation Move.

1522
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,440
Once again, this will make a nice coaster for the next two weeks.

1523
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,440
Saints Row Double Pack.

1524
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:55,800
That's a re-release of the two Saints Row games on Xbox 360 for only $29.99.

1525
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,520
There's also a, let's see here, Brunswick Cosmic Bowling game, which I'm sure is not

1526
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,840
terrible at all on the Wii.

1527
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:11,320
Rooz, it's the real-time strategy game that you can bluff in on Xbox 360 and Playstation

1528
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
3.

1529
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,120
And Assault on Balleria.

1530
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,040
Looks like that's how you pronounce that, I probably fucked that up.

1531
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,560
That's on PC.

1532
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,560
Start the Party.

1533
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,880
It's going to be a real party in your house when you're staring at this Blu-ray case,

1534
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,200
and that's on the PS3.

1535
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,540
What is it?

1536
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,900
How do you start the party?

1537
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:40,120
Start the party by buying the party supplies in preparation for two weeks.

1538
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,760
What is this fucking game, Loki?

1539
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
What are you doing?

1540
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,760
It is a cr- okay.

1541
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
You know Itoy Play?

1542
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,760
Okay.

1543
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,680
Let's do that, but now with the Playstation Move controller.

1544
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,000
It's Start the Party.

1545
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Kung Fu Rider.

1546
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Press start to party.

1547
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,640
Kung Fu Rider, a game so terrible it's actually probably more fun to stare at the case than

1548
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,200
actually play it.

1549
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,920
That'll be coming out as well on the Playstation 3 this week.

1550
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,920
Photo World.

1551
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:12,000
It's a game where you take photos with a DSI camera, and yes, it's a DSI-only game.

1552
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That's awesome.

1553
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,480
That's stuff that I, I don't know, I could do without the game, with the game.

1554
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,560
That sounds more useful than Ping Pals on the DS.

1555
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,560
Yeah, almost.

1556
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,800
The Sims 3 Fast Lane stuff.

1557
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,380
I gotta read this in our chatroom.

1558
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,600
First off, I gotta catch up on some chat comments, because the chat's starting to fill up here.

1559
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,960
Thanks to you guys for tuning in early.

1560
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,960
We really appreciate it.

1561
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,720
There's quite a few of you here tonight, so thank you guys.

1562
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,720
Chat.orangestimesradio.com.

1563
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,640
Let's see, where was the, there was, oh yeah, I wanted to say this about Rose.

1564
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,480
Derek H., who brought up Cammy in the first place, actually says, I destroy people with

1565
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,480
Rose.

1566
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,480
Destroy.

1567
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,480
So there you go.

1568
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,080
Illusion spark, bitches.

1569
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,080
So it looks like you and Derek have a lot in common, because you're both Cammy and Rose

1570
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,080
players.

1571
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,080
Let's see.

1572
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,080
Where was I?

1573
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,120
Say, oh yeah, start the party.

1574
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,720
Redertainment says start the party.

1575
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,800
Gin, vodka, and hot women not included.

1576
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,800
Or fun.

1577
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,040
I do have, I do have vodka and tequila.

1578
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,040
Do you?

1579
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,040
Yes, do you want some?

1580
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,040
Yeah.

1581
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,040
We're gonna start the party right now.

1582
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,880
Seriously, I need you, I need everyone to drink up my booze.

1583
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,480
I'll have a little bit, but keep in mind, I gotta drive home when this is all over,

1584
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,480
so I'll get.

1585
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,480
You've got hours to get sober.

1586
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,800
I'll have a drink or two, well I could also run out and get dinner at some point, so I'll

1587
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
have like a beer.

1588
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Do you have a Guinness?

1589
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,800
I want a Guinness.

1590
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,800
No, I don't have a Guinness.

1591
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,800
I have two New Castles left.

1592
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,360
Oh, New Castle, New Castle, New Castle, New Castle.

1593
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,360
Humor Games this week.

1594
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,360
You can have a New Castle.

1595
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,360
Yay, thank you.

1596
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,360
Oh, sorry.

1597
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,840
UFC Undisputed 2010 on PSP, Prison Tycoon, Alcatraz, once again delayed, thank you value

1598
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,560
soft for not being able to hit your damn street dates.

1599
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:46,640
Dawn of Heroes on DS, speaking of delayed games, that'll be coming out this week, maybe.

1600
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:53,560
King's Bounty Armored Princess, not sure what that is, but yeah, it's on PC.

1601
01:13:53,560 --> 01:14:00,200
And finally, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future on Nintendo DS, that comes out one

1602
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,240
week from today.

1603
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,240
That is it.

1604
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
Alright.

1605
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,720
Let's move on, talk about Japanese release dates, looking at what's coming out in Japan.

1606
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:16,680
Starting off with the Xbox 360 on September 9th, UFC Undisputed 2010 is coming out on

1607
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,920
the Xbox 360, for those that are into that.

1608
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,880
Excuse me, I'm moving on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming out over

1609
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,880
there.

1610
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,480
If I can find it.

1611
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,480
There we go.

1612
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,240
Split Second gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 3.

1613
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,880
Also UFC Undisputed 2010 gets a release there, too.

1614
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,040
By the way, next week, Front Mission Evolved, just so you know, that's on the 16th, but

1615
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,800
I wanted to get that out there because I know there's a lot of Front Mission fans.

1616
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,760
It's kind of a cultish type of game.

1617
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,920
Looking at the Wii and what's coming out on the Wii, we have Okami getting a price cut

1618
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,520
this week on the Wii.

1619
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:59,280
Biohazard 4 is also getting a price cut and the Biohazard Chronicles, that of course is

1620
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,120
Resident Evil, what they call that series over there is Biohazard.

1621
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:09,840
Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, One Piece Gigant Battle from Bandai Namco

1622
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,600
is coming out on the DS this week.

1623
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,120
I have no idea what that game is all about, but I'm assuming it's going to be a giant

1624
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,360
battle.

1625
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:24,920
And then on the PSP, Sengoku Efuda Yugi Hototosigusu Tyran comes out this week from iRAM.

1626
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,160
I have no idea what this game is, I'm trying to look at this real quick.

1627
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,880
This sounds interesting.

1628
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:37,040
It is a board game, it's a port of a board game I guess that's popular in Japan.

1629
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,800
Although this is not one I have ever seen before, I don't think it's chess or anything

1630
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,800
like that.

1631
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,440
Looks like it's a card slash board fusion type of game, so that might be interesting.

1632
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,240
That's coming out on the PSP this next week.

1633
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,020
And then Vitamin X Evolution Plus is also coming out this week.

1634
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,200
That's what it's called.

1635
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,120
So there you go, kind of a slow week in Japan, but just like we are, they're ramping up for

1636
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,620
Christmas.

1637
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:03,300
Although of course Halo is thrown in there to kind of liven things up this month.

1638
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,040
They get Halo next week, just so you know.

1639
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,360
Dark Sakura, what's coming out in Europe?

1640
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,760
On the 6th we have Chime for PC, and then the 7th is Dragon Age Origins Witch Hunt and

1641
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,600
Mass Effect 2, Lair of the Shadow Broker.

1642
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:22,040
And on the 8th we have Amnesia, The Dark Descent, and Plants vs. Zombies, which is crack.

1643
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:29,240
And then on the 10th we have Ace Combat Joint Assault, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, and

1644
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:37,200
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2, which, I don't know, I'm still kind of giddy about Birth by Sleep.

1645
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,240
But this Amnesia thing sounds kind of interesting.

1646
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:45,940
I was looking up a little bit about it too, that I think it would be interesting to see

1647
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,040
that one, but...

1648
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,040
Is that coming out?

1649
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,040
Amnesia?

1650
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,040
Amnesia.

1651
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,080
The Dark Descent.

1652
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,120
It's from Frictional Games.

1653
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
Nope.

1654
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:02,280
If it does it will be ported over by Zoo Games, because they love taking European releases

1655
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,320
and bringing them out over here, eventually.

1656
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,320
Eventually.

1657
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:10,080
After they delayed them for months and months and months and months and months and months

1658
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,480
and months and months and months.

1659
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,720
But Plants vs. Zombies, that game is kind of crack.

1660
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,720
I mean...

1661
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:19,680
I'm actually looking, see, I'm looking forward to downloading that on the iPod when it comes

1662
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,680
in.

1663
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,200
Supposed to get it next week, because they're not yet released.

1664
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,360
It's supposed to be out on DS in January.

1665
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Yes.

1666
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
Yes.

1667
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,360
So...

1668
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:34,080
But, you know, me being kind of a noob to the whole app store and stuff, I'm very pleased

1669
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,880
that they're not that expensive.

1670
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:43,720
Except I was actually shopping for something to use as like a Garmin or, you know, some

1671
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,080
sort of GPS thing.

1672
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,720
To add GPS to the iPod Touch is ridiculously expensive.

1673
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,440
Like I believe it's a TomTom adapter.

1674
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,720
They have, it's $79.99 just for the GPS adapter.

1675
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,760
Then they want you to pay another $40 for the fucking app.

1676
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,760
To which I gave them the big middle finger and said, fuck you, I will just look up directions

1677
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,080
on Google Maps and I'm smart enough as a human being to figure out how to get there.

1678
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:14,000
I do not need you to tell me how to get there for $120, you know, almost $120.

1679
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yeah.

1680
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,800
I better be getting free blowjobs for $120 from that thing, you know.

1681
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,600
It's just, it's not worth it.

1682
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:29,120
And honestly, I mean, if you've got, you may as well just use Google Maps because seriously,

1683
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,080
it's kind of like irritating I think when you have the speaking GPS.

1684
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,080
Yeah.

1685
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,240
I am going to get though, I want to get one of these Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200s.

1686
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:42,680
Now I know that the MiFi 2200 is actually available through a bunch of different, like

1687
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,440
Verizon and Sprint and stuff like that.

1688
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,720
But they're way more expensive and you have to have a contract.

1689
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,180
So I'm cheap.

1690
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:56,180
And sometimes I don't want to pay my bills, so this is perfect.

1691
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,680
I heard about those devices.

1692
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,800
I kind of want to get one.

1693
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
I'm serious.

1694
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,800
I'm getting one for, we could do it for podcasting.

1695
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,360
You can connect with the five devices.

1696
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,680
We can do like podcasting anywhere.

1697
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:10,720
Plus, I'm just going to shove it in my pocket and I can use my iPod touch like, you know,

1698
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,720
like a phone basically.

1699
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,800
I would worry about podcasting over 3G though because we skip enough on this stream as it

1700
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,800
is.

1701
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,280
At least not, it's like an average DSL connection.

1702
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,040
It's not horrible as long as you're in a decent area.

1703
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,320
But I mean, I don't know.

1704
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,920
I wouldn't exactly use it for podcasting all the time.

1705
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,760
Maybe just surfing the web while I'm out there.

1706
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,520
I like the iPhone as far as surfing the web and stuff, but I don't want to pay the fees

1707
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,700
each month for it.

1708
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:46,480
And also, you know, I don't really need the phone stuff too much.

1709
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,240
I use maybe, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes a month.

1710
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:54,240
So all these cell phone plans are way too expensive for what they give me.

1711
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,120
Although I have been looking at, they've been advertising the new Virgin Mobile ones too

1712
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,280
for $25 a month for everything.

1713
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,400
I don't like the phones for that.

1714
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,400
That's the only bad thing.

1715
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,320
If it was like, you know, an iPhone for $25 a month, then I'd be all over that shit.

1716
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,900
Anyway, sorry, I'm not trying to sound like a peddler for Virgin Mobile.

1717
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:20,720
So let's talk about the PlayStation 3 and all sorts of weird stuff going on in the mod

1718
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,600
ship world there.

1719
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:29,800
You may remember the PlayStation Jailbreak was announced last week, and of course, you

1720
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:35,560
know, for a very expensive hundred and, I don't remember how much it was, $70 or something

1721
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,040
like that for it.

1722
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:42,080
Well, funny enough, you know, there was a temporary injunction placed on them last week

1723
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,960
where they were prevented from selling it until the 31st.

1724
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,520
Then the 31st rolled around, and they were delayed until Friday, and on Friday, Sony

1725
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:57,640
actually won the court case, so they had prevented them, OZ mod chips, and actually any of the

1726
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:03,560
mod chip manufacturers or resellers in Australia from selling the devices.

1727
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:10,900
And so they were, you know, basically prevented from selling everything, and they had been

1728
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,240
taking the court and all that stuff.

1729
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:17,120
So everyone that bought one had their money returned, which is awesome, because at the

1730
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,540
same time, you know, the people that may have been buying them from OZ mod chips or even

1731
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:28,820
in the U.S., now Sony is going after the U.S. manufacturers, or I should say resellers.

1732
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:39,400
They're going against Zumba LDC, whose website ShopsJailbreak.com has been selling a new

1733
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:46,680
PS3 Jailbreak mod chips for their very expensive price of like $100 and some dollars.

1734
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,060
So they're going after them now.

1735
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:53,280
But all of that doesn't really matter, because people have already cloned the PlayStation

1736
01:21:53,280 --> 01:22:01,560
Jailbreak with a device called the PS Groove, and the PS Groove basically is an open source

1737
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:09,720
mod chip that runs off of a Teensy++ USB development board or an AT90 USB key.

1738
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,340
Both of those run under $30 some dollars.

1739
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:21,120
It's $24 for the one and about $31 for the other, which is a lot cheaper than, you know,

1740
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,000
$100 and some dollars.

1741
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,960
And what's great about that is, you know, the part that kind of pissed off Sony with

1742
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,120
the whole backup manager, they actually have disabled the backup manager, but then of course

1743
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:36,280
people have released modified versions that have the backup manager in there again.

1744
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,440
But it is a solution that is now widely available.

1745
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:47,360
So Sony, you know, by snipping this other one in the butt, kind of made themselves a

1746
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,860
bigger problem.

1747
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:55,640
And so now they're actually porting the PlayStation Groove to the PSP, which will run as an application

1748
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:00,000
on there on a Homebrew firmware.

1749
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,160
So you'll actually be able to use your PSP for free to mod your PlayStation 3 if you

1750
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,160
have that.

1751
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:12,480
Or if you can't wait for that to come out and you happen to have a Nokia N900, you can

1752
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,200
actually do that for free now.

1753
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:21,760
And you can connect that to your PlayStation 3 using the special port of the PlayStation

1754
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:27,040
Groove to crack your system, so that sucks.

1755
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,880
It's something that I don't know if they're going to be able to patch out.

1756
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,400
It's definitely, if you're using the backup manager, there's ways to tell that you're

1757
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,400
doing it.

1758
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,520
But they're working on ways now to basically make it stealth.

1759
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,740
They've taken the device ID, because each game has like an ID code to it, and so they

1760
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,080
can tell what game you're playing.

1761
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,960
Well, the stealth version of it, which isn't entirely stealth yet, because they haven't

1762
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,640
erased all the old ID code out of it, is making the game look like, or making it look like

1763
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,400
you're playing a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which a lot of people out there

1764
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,000
are, so it would be hard to track them down.

1765
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,960
But it's only going to get worse for them now.

1766
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:08,680
Because once you have this system out now to actually mod your system, people are going

1767
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:12,440
to find out ways to do custom firmwares, and it only goes from there.

1768
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,800
It's just going to snowball.

1769
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,760
Is there anything Sony can do about all this?

1770
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,040
I don't know if they can.

1771
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:26,240
I mean, other than maybe they can fix the hack, but apparently from what I was reading

1772
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:35,280
though, the way that this exploit is done is actually before the firmware, so to patch

1773
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,560
it with the firmware might be impossible.

1774
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,320
It's before the firmware actually kicks in, so it's impossible maybe to do that, but they

1775
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,840
may be able to block the ID for the backup manager or something like that, but they're

1776
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,360
just going to, if it's that easy to change the game ID on the backup manager, that won't

1777
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,280
really be an issue, because they can just keep changing it to keep dodging any blocks

1778
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,220
that they put in place.

1779
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:05,800
So it'll be interesting, and definitely they're going to be doing another update soon for

1780
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,640
either PlayStation Move stuff, I know they already have that Move stuff available right

1781
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:15,520
now, the firmware for that, but they're going to be doing the 3D Blu-ray stuff, and who

1782
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,720
knows what other patches later on.

1783
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,480
They're going to try to patch it, that's for sure, but I have a feeling it's going to go

1784
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,040
back and forth, just like the whole PSP stuff.

1785
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,320
But you won't be able to play online with this, right?

1786
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,560
They'll be able to get that, right?

1787
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,280
As of right now, see here's the thing with the online.

1788
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:37,920
See that's the issue with playing with the backup manager, because it shows that ID code,

1789
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,400
and they can go, okay, this person's playing online with this ID code, okay they're using

1790
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,760
the backup manager, bam, we bam their console.

1791
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,080
But they're changing it to mimic Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, it'll look like, oh they're

1792
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:55,680
playing Modern Warfare 2, and then they're not going to ban them.

1793
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:01,440
So if they successfully masked the backup manager to make it look like Modern Warfare

1794
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:06,320
2, then there really is nothing they can do as far as detecting which console's running

1795
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,280
this backup manager.

1796
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,080
So it's going to be tough.

1797
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,200
Alright, well we'll see what develops.

1798
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,960
I'm kind of curious to see how Sony's long-term strategy of this plays out, because it's kind

1799
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,760
of like, yeah they can try and stop this with the court orders and everything, but once

1800
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,080
the technology's out there, it's out there, you know what I mean, it's going to be very

1801
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,500
hard to stop, especially when they're telling people how to make their own.

1802
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:34,480
And they're already starting to dump games too, so the whole scene now, because the hard

1803
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:39,000
drives, you don't even really have to do too much, you just can copy the files straight

1804
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,320
to your hard drive, and people are just doing Blu-Ray dumps.

1805
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:48,080
Would Spaznator be able to use this to get his videos to work when Sony keeps screwing

1806
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,880
them over with the whole console and all that?

1807
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,880
I don't know.

1808
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,880
I mean, I don't know.

1809
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,560
Alright, let's see, Brakeman in our chat room says, so people hacked a Sony system, isn't

1810
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,960
that business as usual with Sony?

1811
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,960
Not for the PS3.

1812
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,560
Yeah, not for the PS3.

1813
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,720
I mean, they really kind of rolled this out as unhackable, and for a while it certainly

1814
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,740
seemed that way, although we all knew in the back of our heads somebody would hack it eventually,

1815
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:12,960
so it's finally coming around.

1816
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,440
But with the fact that Blu-Ray hasn't really been easily adopted into burning and all that

1817
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:22,720
yet, it's still got a ways to go, I think, before you're going to see mass market piracy

1818
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,720
for this.

1819
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,720
Yeah, I don't know.

1820
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:30,400
But they keep claiming piracy killed the PSP, but I don't know, I have mixed feelings on

1821
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,400
that.

1822
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,400
I don't think it's totally right.

1823
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,840
It's a good scapegoat, because they don't really, it's hard to tell what the numbers

1824
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:41,480
are actually on that, but I'm sure it contributed to it, but then again, look at the Nintendo

1825
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,480
DS.

1826
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:49,400
I mean, that system is doing really well, and I know piracy has affected that, but it's

1827
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:53,120
hard to say, and I don't know.

1828
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:59,720
It'll be interesting to see what happens, but I don't know, it'll just be fun to play

1829
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,840
around with, I think.

1830
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,840
All right.

1831
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:10,800
Well, let's move on to another story about the Xbox 360 this time, and some price changes

1832
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,200
going on in the 360.

1833
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,600
This was news that came out this week.

1834
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:21,800
A one month gold subscription to Xbox Live is going up, starting November 1st, $8 to

1835
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,800
$10.

1836
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,800
That's good.

1837
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:32,400
Three months going up from $20 to $25, and a full year of Xbox Live up $50 to $60.

1838
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:37,480
Of course, that's really $49.99 to $59, but it's $50 to $60.

1839
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,840
I'm throwing in that extra penny there.

1840
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,640
The price of Xbox Live has gone up, folks, but what's interesting about this story, it's

1841
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,960
the first time we've ever had this story in the history of our show, which has been going

1842
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,800
about as long as Xbox Live has.

1843
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,540
They haven't raised the price in the years that it's been active.

1844
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,520
Is it justified that they raise the price now?

1845
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,680
What do you guys think?

1846
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,240
I kind of thought it was about time.

1847
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:07,780
I mean, you've got to keep up with the market, and if you're not making enough to match cost

1848
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:13,160
and still have the right profit margin they're expecting, then I don't see why not.

1849
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,360
By the way, if you're worried about this price increase, there are some ways you can lock

1850
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,360
in the old price.

1851
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:23,720
You can do a renewal of one year through Xbox.com right now for $40, or you can also buy some

1852
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:28,300
of those prepaid cards right now with the lower prices, because you can still find those

1853
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,640
for the old prices.

1854
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,520
If you load up on a couple of those, then you'll be locked in for however much time.

1855
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,680
Dude, it's seriously like 80 some cents more a month.

1856
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,800
That's what it is, average out, and honestly, $10 more, yeah, that is more money for you

1857
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:49,380
to pay, but look at what the hell, download content and your Xbox Live arcade games cost

1858
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,380
that much.

1859
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:53,800
I understand that everybody's cash strapped nowadays with the economy and everything,

1860
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,800
but come on.

1861
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,600
Eat one less lunch out or something, I mean, stop fucking bitching about $10.

1862
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,720
It's not like the price is doubling, and I understand that you may not use all the features,

1863
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:08,840
because honestly, I don't use most of the features on Xbox Live.

1864
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:14,280
I don't use Twitter, I don't use Facebook, none of the extra stuff, and the ESPN's streaming

1865
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,320
and stuff like that, I could care less about it, and the fact that it's going up $10, it

1866
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,040
doesn't really bother me, because so what?

1867
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,720
Well speaking of ESPN, in our chat room, Blaze says, given that this ESPN functionality is

1868
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:31,080
supposed to be absurdly amazing, that it's not that big a deal.

1869
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:35,040
Breakman says, fuck you Microsoft, everyone kept asking them when Xbox Live will go free,

1870
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,200
so they said fuck you, we'll raise the price.

1871
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,920
I'm okay with this price hike, because they haven't done one in so long, and it does seem

1872
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,760
like, you know, the amount of content on Xbox Live, there's a lot of it there.

1873
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:51,880
I'm okay with it, you know, because we're talking on a yearly basis too.

1874
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:57,020
If this is where we're going instead of the online pass, I'm okay with it.

1875
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,540
But unfortunately, I think we all know it's not.

1876
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:05,120
That online pass still exists, and to me, you can't do this and that.

1877
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,120
You really shouldn't.

1878
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:10,400
This online pass is ridiculous in the first place, but it's even more so with this.

1879
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:15,360
I don't blame Microsoft for the online pass stuff, I blame the third party publishers.

1880
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,600
Microsoft could stop it.

1881
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,060
It's their servers, their stores, they could stop.

1882
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,060
It's their software though.

1883
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:27,160
If they want to prevent people from connecting online, they can do that.

1884
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,160
It's their software.

1885
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:32,120
I understand that they should step up and say, hey, you know, you shouldn't be doing

1886
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:36,020
that kind of stuff on our service, because they made a member of everybody play nice

1887
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:41,600
with the guitar controllers and stuff like that, they all had to work together.

1888
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,240
That was kind of cool, but I think that they should step up and do that, since they have

1889
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:51,600
dedicated servers for all this stuff, but once again, it's these third party companies

1890
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,360
getting greedy with forced up.

1891
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:59,440
It sets a really bad precedent though, when you have Sony doing the same thing.

1892
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,720
Like if Microsoft said, oh, by the way, we're going to charge you $10 to play this game

1893
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:06,960
online, or I'm sorry, yeah, Microsoft said, no, we're going to charge you $10 extra to

1894
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,820
play this game online if you buy it used, then there might be some issues, but I don't

1895
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:15,340
think they're going to go that route, because they're making enough money as it is on live

1896
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:22,400
and maybe they try supporting it with ad revenue and stuff like that, and maybe just the cost

1897
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:29,400
to run this stuff keeps going up and up, I mean, they keep adding features and stuff

1898
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:34,700
to it, and maybe it's just getting more expensive, I don't know.

1899
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:39,920
I really do feel the value of $50 for Xbox Live now is certainly better than it was eight

1900
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:40,920
years ago.

1901
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,920
Which is cool.

1902
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,880
I don't think that they would just say, okay, you know what, we want to make more money,

1903
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,880
so we're going to raise the price.

1904
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,880
I think that they would actually say, okay, listen, because they're going to try to keep

1905
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:57,320
it as low as possible to stay competitive with the PlayStation network, and I don't

1906
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:01,000
see them raising prices just because, oh, we need to make more money.

1907
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,600
I think it's just that the cost of doing things is going up.

1908
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:10,760
Blaze said, remember that this online pass stuff applies to games that are multi console,

1909
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:16,400
and Microsoft requires online play to go through their servers, but Sony makes third party

1910
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,880
people run their own servers.

1911
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:25,040
Well okay, but still, then put the online pass on Sony, not Microsoft.

1912
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,480
Stop being lazy and just putting out the same code for both systems.

1913
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:31,960
If people are that pissed off about a $10 price hike, then you need to spend the extra

1914
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:38,280
effort it's going to take to go and find those cards for cheaper, and honestly, there are

1915
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,280
cards out there.

1916
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,400
There's a lot of ways to get cards for like 40 bucks now.

1917
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,880
Go stock up on some of those.

1918
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:51,160
If you're so concerned about you spend the extra 83 cents a month, seriously, go for

1919
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:56,960
a walk around your local strip malls and stuff like that.

1920
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,280
You could probably find 83 cents on the ground.

1921
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,960
It's not that fucking expensive.

1922
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,880
Seriously, go without a can of soda one week.

1923
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,120
83 cents a month, let's break that down by week.

1924
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:14,480
That's like 20 cents a week, come on, find a dime.

1925
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,760
I understand that it's not that much money, but here you go, you're the devil's advocate.

1926
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,560
It's the principle.

1927
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,240
They're raising the price, and what are they doing to justify the raising of the price?

1928
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:29,780
Well people aren't too worried about paying $60 for games.

1929
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:35,280
That's a $10 price hike per game, so why aren't you just still playing your original PlayStation

1930
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,680
2 and Xbox then?

1931
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:41,560
Why aren't you boycotting all these different game systems since it's so expensive for you

1932
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,240
to spend the extra $10?

1933
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:46,920
I think you're a fucking hypocrite is what I think you are.

1934
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:51,040
Break Man in our chat room says, I'll pay Microsoft an extra $10 a month to take Facebook

1935
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,920
off my 360.

1936
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,920
Amen to that.

1937
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,640
Facebook on 360 is ugly.

1938
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,320
It looks better on a cell phone, and that is saying a lot.

1939
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,540
Anyhow, let's move on and get into the classic video game of the week.

1940
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:08,280
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane, where Dark Sakura will dig into the

1941
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:14,380
gamer vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids out there in internet land.

1942
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,920
Get off my lawn and play this game.

1943
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,880
Get off my lawn and go inside and play this game.

1944
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,600
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1945
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,600
X-Men for the Sega Genesis.

1946
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,600
This game is cool.

1947
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:33,360
I have to save something for the future, Rob.

1948
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,180
Probably I think one of the best games that came on the Genesis.

1949
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:45,760
It was in 1993, and it was the whole 90s era of X-Men.

1950
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,840
The game basically starts off, we're in the danger room, and there's a virus that goes

1951
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,040
into the danger rooms.

1952
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:56,880
You have to go through different areas within the danger room, and then fight Magneto at

1953
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,880
the end.

1954
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:07,320
So you play as Gambit, or Nightcrawler, Wolverine, or Cyclops, and they have different, you know,

1955
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:11,480
regular punches, kicks, whatever, and then they have their mutant power that has a dumb

1956
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:16,720
power bar, and then they have the rest of their life bar.

1957
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:22,040
Your bar will regenerate, and you can also switch characters in mid-level, so that helps

1958
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,680
you save stuff off.

1959
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:32,080
So yeah, with Wolverine, he basically has his big bad claws and his healing factor.

1960
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:38,160
Gambit has his charged cards for a special attack, Cyclops has the optic blast, and Nightcrawler

1961
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,200
has the ability to teleport, which is useful.

1962
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,600
He was actually my favorite character to use in the game.

1963
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:51,860
You also get Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel as sort of helpers.

1964
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:56,320
You can call on them for help, and you can also get Jean Grey to pop up if you happen

1965
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,960
to fall, and you fight different X-Men villains, so it's pretty cool.

1966
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:03,480
But one of the cool things about this game, and it had a...

1967
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:09,320
It broke the fourth wall.

1968
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,860
When you defeat Mojo, you have to reset the computer in the danger room, but what it really

1969
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:18,520
means is reset your machine, and the whole trick is you just sort of have to pop the

1970
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:24,360
reset button, and then it'll black out and pop up these numbers like a computer rebooting,

1971
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,760
you know, in the 90s.

1972
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,280
So what, somebody's 486, I guess?

1973
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:34,560
Anyway, um, but we had a giggle from Loki about something.

1974
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,040
Sorry, something someone posted.

1975
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,040
Uh...

1976
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,040
I'm curious now.

1977
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,720
Uh, take a right.

1978
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,840
Can wait until after the classic game.

1979
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,520
Um, one thing that I need to point out is that if you hit the button too hard, of course,

1980
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,320
it will reset the game, and you're like SOL.

1981
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:59,080
Or if you have a nomad, the nomad doesn't have a reset button, so you're SOL there unless

1982
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,680
you level skip.

1983
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:07,020
Um, all of the music in the game was done by Fletcher Beasley, who used the Genesis

1984
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:14,960
emulation music software, and it would work with the Yamaha 2612 FM synthesizer chip on

1985
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,680
the Genesis, so you could play the sounds back through it and you know what it sounds

1986
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,680
like.

1987
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,680
So it's actually got a really cool soundtrack.

1988
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:23,120
I think that it sounds really good.

1989
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:29,400
Um, but he's quoted as saying that he was trying to use the sound of the distorted guitar

1990
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:32,800
in his tracks to make them sound edgier.

1991
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,600
And, I mean, it's got a great soundtrack.

1992
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,600
Kudos to him.

1993
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,240
But it was a really cool game.

1994
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,360
It actually, there's one level in that game that pissed me off to no end, and it was always,

1995
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,480
um, the Mojo World level.

1996
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,480
Hated it.

1997
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,880
I'm dead.

1998
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,880
That's fighting Mojo.

1999
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,880
Mojo Jojo.

2000
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:52,880
Just kidding.

2001
01:38:52,880 --> 01:39:01,080
Alright, there you go, your classic game of the week is X-Man on the Genesis.

2002
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,080
Good times.

2003
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:05,240
Thank you very much, Dark Soccer.

2004
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:09,760
Good pick, even if I'm more of a fan of the arcade one, but that's okay.

2005
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,040
Okay, Loki, why are you giggling?

2006
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,040
Oh, nothing.

2007
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:17,760
There was someone was pointing out, actually one of our listeners, they were pointing out

2008
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,040
that, you know, have you heard that, you know, have you seen the story about Earth Defense

2009
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,240
Force, a new Earth Defense Force game coming out next year?

2010
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:31,220
And I actually clicked on the link to check it out, and then it links the Structoid article

2011
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:36,920
that links also a CheapAssGamer article, where I'm the source of that news information.

2012
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:37,920
Nice.

2013
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,440
It's like, yeah, I heard about it.

2014
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:44,380
Actually, I'm looking at this, this was just, what's today, the fifth?

2015
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:46,320
This was like four hours ago.

2016
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:51,520
Yeah, the GameStop conference, I think they had an actual logo for it, and if you go to

2017
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:58,040
uh, uh, EDFIA.com, you can check out, they have the placeholder logo for it, Earth Defense

2018
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,040
Force, Insect Armageddon.

2019
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:03,760
Actually, you gotta hear this, this is pretty good, and shout out to this guy, because he

2020
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,900
must be a listener to the show, but this is on examiner.com, I guess?

2021
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:11,800
Is that the Chicago Cons, I don't know.

2022
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,480
Orange Launch Radio podcast co-host, Loki, has recently uncovered a sequel to the B-movie

2023
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,000
quality Earth Defense Force 2017.

2024
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,380
If this news is correct, then all is well with the world, the game falls under the same

2025
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:23,520
category as Deadly Premonition for me.

2026
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,520
According to his information, Earth Defense Force 2017, Insect Armageddon for the Xbox

2027
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,960
360, is being released sometime in February 2011 by D3 publisher.

2028
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,320
Loki, who works for a game distributor and has a strong track record on things such as

2029
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:38,920
unannounced games, tweeted the following, just saw this on my release list from D3,

2030
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,640
Earth Defense Force 2017, Insect Armageddon, coming February on Xbox 360.

2031
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,120
Dude, wasn't that like a month ago that you tweeted that?

2032
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,120
What's a month ago?

2033
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,440
This ran four hours ago on this website.

2034
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:51,440
As someone who has invested a crazy amount of time in Earth Defense Force, I accept this

2035
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,440
story.

2036
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,920
That's just a repost of the Cheap Ass Gamer one, I think.

2037
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:55,920
Is it?

2038
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,920
That's Blue Swim.

2039
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:57,920
Whatever.

2040
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,920
But anyway.

2041
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,920
That's funny to me.

2042
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:00,920
It is funny.

2043
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:01,920
I hope you're right.

2044
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,520
We haven't heard anything more about it, have we?

2045
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:05,520
I am right.

2046
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,520
It's on their release list.

2047
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:12,840
But I don't want anybody saying that I said that, I mean, I don't want D3 being pissed

2048
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,720
off at me, because then that comes back to me, and then I lose my job.

2049
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,840
That's why you gotta stop putting on Twitter, you have to do it here on the show in Secret

2050
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,560
Club, where these people don't listen.

2051
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,360
Well, people just need to stop realizing that.

2052
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,160
I'm a crazy person that says these things, okay?

2053
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:35,520
Yeah, it's just meant for sharing with the listeners, not to be as posted as a story.

2054
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:40,720
It's so when, you know, Joystiq picks this article up, you know, say four months from

2055
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,440
now, and they're like, hey, we just discovered that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then

2056
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:48,840
be like, hey, I knew about that months ago, good job.

2057
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:52,880
You know, it's just so you can realize that we knew it first.

2058
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,760
But you've also, they better not be mad at you, because you know what, you've been supporting

2059
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,760
this game from the beginning.

2060
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:58,920
It is so awesome!

2061
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
I am so excited!

2062
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,840
You probably know how this will happen, honestly.

2063
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,480
I don't know anyone who talks about this on you.

2064
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:07,080
I own four copies of this game, okay?

2065
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,540
And you know why I did that?

2066
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:11,160
Just in case ever one of my discs breaks.

2067
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:14,720
Which one of them has, because I played it so much.

2068
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,880
So I had three backup copies that I bought, you know, we were clearing them out of our

2069
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,800
warehouse for five bucks each, I'm like, I'm taking all of those!

2070
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:29,000
So yeah, I love this game, and I fully support the sequel, and I hope to God it has four-player

2071
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
co-op.

2072
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Can I borrow one?

2073
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,920
I actually looked for the game, I never was able to find it.

2074
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,920
Oh, sure.

2075
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:35,920
All right.

2076
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,240
But yeah, lesson learned here.

2077
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,600
Stop posting low-key stuff!

2078
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:45,160
No, I don't care, it doesn't, I don't, it's, I mean, they would have said something by

2079
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,160
now.

2080
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,160
Yeah, it's true.

2081
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,400
It was out there a month ago.

2082
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,560
And honestly, I mean, it's...

2083
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,920
The official logo showed up now, right?

2084
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,720
The official, they have the official websites up, and the GameStop conference, someone took

2085
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:58,080
a picture that says, Earth Defense Force returns 2011.

2086
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,080
So there you go.

2087
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,080
They have a banner for it.

2088
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,080
It's happening.

2089
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,720
So you were, but that went to, okay, so the story that went up four hours ago then is

2090
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:07,520
like behind, because this has already been confirmed, it's no longer a rumor.

2091
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,860
Yeah, well, Destructoid, they ran their story 16 hours ago, apparently, and they just picked

2092
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:17,680
up on, uh, uh, Neo Games Are Fun, I guess.

2093
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:25,640
They ran their, this, uh, was posted yesterday, so, I don't know, people are just figuring

2094
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,640
it out now.

2095
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:32,120
Does, see, that's why you gotta read myself closely, because, I don't know, I like...

2096
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:37,000
Well, Destructoid called D3 to get confirmation, so maybe you'll be in the office on Tuesday

2097
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
and you're...

2098
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Who told you that?

2099
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Uh, uh, um...

2100
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,480
CheapAss, well, they say, they reference CheapAssGamer.

2101
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:49,080
But they also have Neo, but they also have, uh, NeoGAF, though, like, right above that

2102
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,080
link, if you noticed.

2103
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:55,120
Wait, you know what, that's kind of fucked up, though, because it really wasn't CheapAssGamer.

2104
01:43:55,120 --> 01:44:01,600
It's somebody on a blog on CheapAssGamer who starts off by referencing you.

2105
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,560
You know, and that, that's, that really was not CheapAssGamer doing that at all.

2106
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,640
It had nothing to do with that.

2107
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,080
It was that user.

2108
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,840
So either that user or you should have been credited.

2109
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,120
I mean, I'm not to, I'm just saying.

2110
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,120
A little bit, a little bit.

2111
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:18,520
I don't really care that I'm not credited, and it was, it's, uh, Blue Swim, which I believe

2112
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,520
is one of our listeners.

2113
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,520
Yeah, I've heard that name before.

2114
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,520
It's one of our listeners.

2115
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,520
Uh, yeah, so...

2116
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,840
And it's, I get it, that website does little personal blog things, and he's excited about

2117
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:26,840
this game like you are.

2118
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,640
And then, as, as he should be, it's an exciting game.

2119
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,520
But yeah, I understand that, because they wanna run that, because, you know, they run

2120
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:33,520
that kind of crap.

2121
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,840
And now they have more proof other than me saying it, because, you know, while I have

2122
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,960
a strong track record, I can't be trusted, because that's apparently why they didn't

2123
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,960
run the story in the first place.

2124
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,960
I see.

2125
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:43,960
I see.

2126
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,120
Because they need some physical proof, because I could just be spoutin' off crap.

2127
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:49,560
Because, you know, that's what I do all the time.

2128
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,560
I don't know.

2129
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,560
It's, it's stupid.

2130
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:52,560
Alright.

2131
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,560
We're over it.

2132
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:54,560
Let's get poses.

2133
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,560
I'm over it.

2134
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,560
Yeah, let's get poses.

2135
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,560
Kind of, just kind of funny.

2136
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,560
I am gonna beg them, though, for a copy of that game.

2137
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,560
I'm like, you need to send that to me now!

2138
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,600
Alright, we're gonna take a break.

2139
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,400
We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

2140
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,080
Uh, tonight's the marathon, folks.

2141
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:10,640
We're, uh, about almost two hours in already, and we've got plenty more show to come.

2142
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,360
Uh, we still have the main show.

2143
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:16,600
We are gonna do Twitter topics, rapid-fire stories, uh, some news about the iPod Touch

2144
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:21,360
you're gonna get into, uh, some iPod-related news, um, Xbox Live Arcade, price drop for

2145
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:26,160
the DSI, the mailbags, the FUs, all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange

2146
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,960
Lounge Radio.

2147
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,640
And we are gonna be taking a music break here.

2148
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:32,280
Um, I'm gonna be editing the podcast a little differently.

2149
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,440
It's just gonna kind of jump-skip into the next segment, so I apologize for the sloppy

2150
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,720
editing, but we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast.

2151
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,120
Uh, we are gonna take a quick break, though, here in studio.

2152
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,360
Um, we'll do some music.

2153
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:48,360
By the way, today's break music is, like, all music that we used to play on, uh, OLR

2154
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:53,360
during, uh, when we were an actual station back in, what, like, 02, 03, so.

2155
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,160
We're, cause we're awesome that way.

2156
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,160
Yes.

2157
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,840
So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2158
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,840
Don't go anywhere.

2159
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,840
About five minutes.

2160
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:00,840
Marathon continues.

2161
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:08,120
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

2162
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:12,720
We are live on this Saturday, or, sorry, Sunday, September the 5th of 2010.

2163
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,840
It's our marathon episode.

2164
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,640
We're still in kind of the main part of the show.

2165
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,840
Uh, there's been a lot of people asking if this marathon is gonna be podcast.

2166
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:19,840
Yes.

2167
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:20,840
We're gonna podcast it.

2168
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,800
Um, it'll go up on the feed in kind of different chunks throughout the week.

2169
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:28,000
Uh, but we wanna have, like, a main, you know, first off, I don't know how people are gonna

2170
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,080
listen to, like, 12 hours of marathon throughout the week, but I suppose we have a lot of people

2171
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:35,240
at work and so forth that listen to a lot of podcasts while they do, you know, whatever

2172
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,680
desk job they might have.

2173
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,280
Um, so, you know, we'll put it out for those guys.

2174
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,640
But, um, for those that only want, like, the three hour OLR that they're used to, we're

2175
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:47,000
kind of taping our usual show for you of all the segments we usually do, and we'll save

2176
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,120
some of the special stuff for a little later.

2177
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:52,160
So anyhow, um, let's get back into the marathon.

2178
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,480
It's just about four o'clock.

2179
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,480
We started at about two.

2180
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,920
Uh, we're gonna get back into some more, um, news.

2181
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,960
We're gonna do some rapid fire news, as we always do about this time in the show.

2182
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,860
Twitter topics coming up, and I haven't seen a lot come through on Twitter.

2183
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:07,520
Maybe I, I didn't ask earlier enough for stuff, but we'll see.

2184
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,760
So Twitter topics, uh, if you're hearing my voice, you wanna get some Twitter topics in,

2185
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,760
send those in.

2186
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,320
Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?

2187
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:17,680
Oh, try to ref- hey, on Twitter topics, guys, try to refrain from just linking us to news

2188
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:21,360
stories, because we have a lot coming up later in the marathon, too.

2189
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,040
Um, you know, not that we don't appreciate that, but, uh, we probably are covering it

2190
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,040
at some point.

2191
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,040
Yeah.

2192
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,960
But if you have good questions or, or feedback on an earlier story or something, that's definitely

2193
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,960
what we're looking for tonight.

2194
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,520
All right, so let's get into some rapid fire news.

2195
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,520
Loki.

2196
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:41,040
Uh, there was an Easter egg discovered from, uh, Wave Race, Blue Storm, uh, yes, that old

2197
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,040
game.

2198
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:46,040
Um, they actually just found a, uh, what was it?

2199
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:51,920
It's an Easter egg that kinda changes some of the announcer audio, um, in the game.

2200
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,360
He starts B-rating you, and then also, for some reason, when you do your boost, it goes

2201
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:02,520
meow-meow, which is, I'm sure Irene would get a kick out of that.

2202
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:07,600
But, uh, yeah, it's, um, it's interesting, though, and apparently it's just, uh, a key

2203
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:14,000
press that you do in one of the options screens, um, but yeah, it's funny that games, even

2204
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,200
though they're out, you know, that long, that some Easter eggs are just, you know, haven't

2205
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,200
been discovered yet.

2206
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:23,960
I remember there was one that was a couple weeks ago about, um, it was a Splinter Cell

2207
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:28,680
game, and they actually had it where, uh, there was a mission, a secret mission where

2208
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:35,800
you had to recover, um, or had to find all these, uh, space seals that were hidden in

2209
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,800
the game.

2210
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,080
It was a special, uh, save the seals mission, which is kinda weird.

2211
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:48,520
Um, there is a, uh, a game from Activision called Blood Drive that's, uh, I guess the

2212
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:56,080
information has been leaked out from the BBFC, um, I also saw it on their list, um, and it

2213
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,560
is gonna be a combat racing game.

2214
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:05,080
They, uh, guess, uh, the marketing shill, as they, uh, put it, is, uh, it's Shaun of

2215
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,200
the Dead meets Mad Max in Death Race.

2216
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:11,200
So basically a game that's cheesy and very gory.

2217
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,440
That sounds like fun.

2218
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:13,840
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

2219
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:20,560
And, uh, it is somewhat budget priced, it's $50 retail, and, uh, it'll be coming out in

2220
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,560
November.

2221
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:24,160
So, uh, that'd be cool.

2222
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,460
I'm, I'm down for combat racing games.

2223
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:29,600
And cheesy is good, as long as it's a good game.

2224
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:33,880
You know, not necessarily a terrible driving game.

2225
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:38,880
I don't know what universe $50 is a budget game, but I get it, I get it's $10 cheaper,

2226
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:39,880
but, yeah.

2227
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:40,880
Slightly cheaper.

2228
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,880
Hey, there you go!

2229
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,200
It's a combat game instead of a normal 360 game, you've saved your $10 that you can spend

2230
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,200
on live.

2231
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:49,520
Uh, dance, it's your stage.

2232
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,520
Coming out on Xbox Live Arcade September 8th, as I like to reiterate, it was a terrible

2233
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,520
game!

2234
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:01,080
But anyways, in case you're still curious about it, it is, um, a port of a German Wii

2235
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:09,600
game developed by Sproing, and, uh, I guess you, uh, you'll practice 20 unique choreographies

2236
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:15,120
and dance your way from the street stage all the way to the TV studio, under the watchful

2237
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:21,120
eye of, uh, Detlef, Detlef D. Seust?

2238
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,120
Some douche!

2239
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:29,380
Who, who is basically, uh, some German dancer, choreographer, um...

2240
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:31,280
Like I said.

2241
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:36,800
Honestly, uh, like I said before, it's a terrible game.

2242
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,480
It's just, it doesn't play very well, and, um, you know, if you look at the screenshots

2243
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:50,120
that they have of it, it's got this really weird, um, not like a note highway or something,

2244
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:54,420
but it's, it's sort of like DDR where they've got, you know, arrows coming down the screen,

2245
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:59,480
but it's two different rows of arrows, see, as you can see right here, and, um, you have

2246
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:04,360
to kind of move them in different, move your controllers in different directions to match

2247
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:10,760
that, the different analog sticks, and while that might be cool and stuff to do on, like,

2248
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:15,680
say, you know, a dance pad or something, it's really awkward on the controller, especially

2249
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:20,960
since, you know, one side doesn't correspond to certain directions, it's just mixed all

2250
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:26,880
over the place, and, uh, the music's terrible, so don't buy it.

2251
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:27,880
Nice.

2252
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:28,880
Instead, you need to buy some other games.

2253
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:33,360
Um, I think, uh, Plants vs. Zombies might be this week, so, you know, check that out.

2254
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:40,640
Uh, then of course, uh, the new iPod Touch with iOS 4, the, uh, retina display and, uh,

2255
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:46,160
game center has been, uh, revealed at the new, uh, Apple event that was this week, uh,

2256
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:53,440
is available in the 8 gigabyte model for $229, 32 gigs for $299, and a 64 gig model for $399.

2257
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,480
It is coming out next week, and it basically has all the wonderful features of the new

2258
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:07,160
iPhone 4, except, of course, no GPS, um, no phone, and, uh, much, much cheaper, I think,

2259
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,720
but, um, yeah, we will be picking one of those up myself.

2260
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:13,640
Also, uh, some of the other stuff that they, um, announced at the event, of course, the

2261
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:20,220
new Apple TV for $99, um, which is kind of cool, I guess, if you're into that.

2262
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:24,120
And then, um, something else that was kind of cool, one of the things that they're really

2263
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:29,760
kind of pushing that, you know, the iPhone and iPod is like a gaming platform, Project

2264
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:35,400
Sword, which is a game that's running on the Unreal 3 engine, and, um, is coming out from

2265
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:41,600
Epic, and actually looks pretty good, so it is a sword fighting game that is, uh, focused

2266
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:47,600
on one-on-one battles, so kind of like, uh, oh, there's a, some Wii game that came out

2267
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:51,920
that's kind of similar to that, hopefully not like the Castlevania fighting game, but,

2268
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,880
uh, looks pretty good, and it's kind of amazing to see that they ported the Unreal 3 engine

2269
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,760
to, you know, iOS, so neat.

2270
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,760
Neat.

2271
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:07,040
Alright, um, do you, now, Alan, you were talking about something earlier that you'd seen about

2272
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,040
this whole mess, right?

2273
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:13,440
Yeah, I've been reading on Joystiq and Kotaku about a free tech demo that Epic released,

2274
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:18,260
um, this week called Epic Citadel for the iPhone 4, and also for the new iPod Touches

2275
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:22,640
that are coming out, and it's basically the engine that this, uh, sword game is gonna

2276
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:28,280
be running on, but it's pretty much just you and the touch interface and, like, a town,

2277
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:32,200
and all you can do is really just walk around and look at stuff, but the graphics, I guess,

2278
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:36,580
the way they ported the Unreal engine into the phone is so good that you just can't believe

2279
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:40,360
that you're getting this on an iPhone, and the videos for it, for those that want to

2280
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:45,560
look it up on Google, it's called Epic Citadel, it's free on the App Store, so whoever has

2281
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,240
a new iPhone can download it and check it out, it's supposed to be amazing.

2282
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,240
I'm downloading it right now.

2283
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,320
You know, it's really sad, is all they would really have to do now with the iPhone to really

2284
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:57,080
kind of compete in the market, well, I mean, they already are competing in the market with,

2285
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,640
like, the Nintendo DS and the PSP, but they're really kind of...

2286
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:03,560
Well, they came out at the conference, they took a shot at Nintendo and Sony and said

2287
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:08,320
that they've sold more than those two combined, although it's, it's fuzzy math, but yeah.

2288
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:09,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand.

2289
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,320
Alright, I'm downloading it.

2290
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:14,800
But to basically kind of deliver that finishing blow, if you would put it, if they added,

2291
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:19,160
like, some sort of actual buttons, you know, some sort of controller interface to that,

2292
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:22,160
it would be, I mean, how are you going to compete with that?

2293
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:26,440
I mean, now you've got, you know, a platform that's very popular, the apps are really cheap,

2294
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:30,120
and the games are actually getting to be on par, if not better, than some of the stuff

2295
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,640
that's on the PSP and on the DS.

2296
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:36,120
Yeah, it really is the one thing that the iPhone, iTouch, whatever is missing is a tangible

2297
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,120
controller.

2298
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:40,800
I mean, if they could have that, it would be amazing.

2299
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:46,680
When you were playing Sonic 2 on the iPhone 4 at the Apple Store, they had to bring the

2300
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:50,240
screen in a little bit to, like, a little thumbnail so that it could put a little, a

2301
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:53,880
digital D-pad and buttons on there, and it really affected the gameplay.

2302
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,040
Yeah, it sure did.

2303
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,520
So we'll see.

2304
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,080
An alpha-kinanogram in our chatroom at chat.orangesondre.com agrees, seriously, Apple just needs to make

2305
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,560
a controller shell for it.

2306
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:08,320
Takeo Ray in our chatroom says, yes, Epic Citadel is all eye candy, and it looks sweet.

2307
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:14,000
Here's something, I mean, we've kind of thrown this idea out for a while now, um, you know,

2308
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
what if Apple made a gaming console?

2309
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,920
Well, what if they did that?

2310
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:21,600
I mean, the Apple TV's down to $99, who's to say they can't come up with some sort of

2311
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,280
wireless Bluetooth controller or something that works with Apple?

2312
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,200
All they have to do is put iOS on that box.

2313
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,320
Yeah, iOS on the box to make it, you know, a more...

2314
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,320
Yeah, a wireless controller.

2315
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:32,520
Maybe a little bit more powerful, you know, like, kind of like an iPhone or something

2316
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,520
like that.

2317
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:38,960
And, you know, then now your games are really cheap, it's all digital, but, you know, and

2318
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,120
make a portable system.

2319
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,600
They're gonna...

2320
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:45,160
Sony better step up, because, seriously, right now they're really slacking as far as their

2321
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:50,400
system goes, and, you know, they're gonna lose it really quick.

2322
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,400
We'll see.

2323
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:55,200
All right, well, speaking of the iPhone, Mirror's Edge and Puzzle Agent also came out on the

2324
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:56,200
iPhone.

2325
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,600
Those were releases earlier this week.

2326
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,960
Uh, Mirror's Edge, uh, was already out on the iPad, but now it's on the iPhone.

2327
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:06,000
On the iPad it was ten bucks, and now it's only gonna be five bucks on the iPhone.

2328
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,640
Uh, Telltale is, uh, trying out a game release on, uh, iPhone.

2329
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:11,640
It's Puzzle Agent.

2330
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,200
You might remember this came out on PCs a little bit ago.

2331
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,520
Uh, that is, uh, where Telltale games are about approximately on the other iDevices.

2332
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,360
So, um, yeah, they're on the App Store, and, uh, check those out if you, uh, are interested

2333
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,520
in either of those series.

2334
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:29,760
Uh, otherwise, going back to the more traditional consoles, on the Xbox Live Arcade, uh, King

2335
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:35,520
of Fighters Sky Stage is supposed to be hitting the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade on September

2336
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,520
15th.

2337
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:39,960
Uh, it's gonna be costing, uh, ten dollars, eight, eight hundred Microsoft Points, or

2338
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,520
whatever that converts to in Yen.

2339
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:47,840
Uh, and that is the one, by the way, where, like, Terry Bogard and Mai are, like, shooters.

2340
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:51,120
This is that one that's the whole, like, King of Fighters are in a shooting game.

2341
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:52,120
Remember that?

2342
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,120
Yeah.

2343
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,120
That's this game.

2344
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:57,720
So, a lot of the, uh, horizontal screen real estate is just taken up with pretty pictures

2345
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,880
of, of Terry and Mai there.

2346
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:05,200
And lastly, for my little bit here, Tron Evolution has a release date, and there's also a sweet

2347
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:06,840
collector's edition to go with it.

2348
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,760
The release date is December 7th.

2349
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,800
I think that's a couple weeks before the movie.

2350
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,920
Uh, Tron, it, it's kind of interesting that Disney's doing this twice, because Epic Mickey

2351
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,760
has a collector's edition, too.

2352
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:21,680
But, uh, with Tron Evolution, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there will be the, um, collector's

2353
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,680
edition.

2354
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:28,520
It comes with a toy model light cycle from Schlight, from Sideshow Collectibles, a display

2355
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:31,860
case for it with a drawer to keep the game in.

2356
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:36,520
It's $130, which, you know, so you're paying an extra, what, $70 for this figurine, but

2357
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:39,960
I gotta say, that's a sweet-looking figurine.

2358
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,200
That's, it's like a little light bike from the new movie.

2359
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:47,400
That is, I don't know if I, if it actually lit up, I might have to do it, but, uh, no

2360
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,400
word on that yet.

2361
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:51,200
I would just wait and see, because they're gonna have collectible toys and stuff, I'm

2362
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,840
sure, when the Tron stuff comes out.

2363
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:53,840
Very true.

2364
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:57,320
You could probably buy one standalone that would be a lot cooler than that.

2365
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:02,640
Um, it just, those collector's editions, man, sometimes it's a real waste of money.

2366
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:05,680
However, though, you know, the Black Ops one that they have coming out now with that

2367
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,840
little car that has, like, a camera on it and stuff?

2368
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:14,160
Those things are actually out now as some other device, um, but, I mean, they're really

2369
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:19,440
popular in, like, the hacking community, because they're so easy to modify to do a bunch of

2370
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,960
different things, like installing Linux and crap on it and stuff, so it might be a good

2371
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:27,440
buy to actually get that, or if, you know, you're smart, you'll just go buy the actual

2372
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:32,120
toy that's out now instead of spending, you know, the extra money.

2373
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:36,600
Tron is awesome, but any game that's a movie tie-in, eh, not sure of what.

2374
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,920
I don't know, this game looks pretty awesome.

2375
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,680
I gotta say, I played it at E3, and it was kinda cool, because it was like Prince of

2376
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:46,200
Persia, but with Tron graphics, and, like, apparently it's heavily influenced with Capoeira,

2377
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,120
like all the fighting is based on Capoeira.

2378
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:52,520
I gotta say, it was kinda rad, but Shane was watching me play it, and, you know, Shane

2379
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,720
didn't really see Tron as a kid, because I think he was, like, born the year it came

2380
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:02,480
out or something, um, so, like, I know, right, so I think, like, he was looking at it going,

2381
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:06,600
there's not a lot of graphics in this game, what is, and I'm like, that's, it looks like

2382
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:11,200
Tron, Tron looked like that, you don't understand, it's okay, it's stylistic, so he wasn't as

2383
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,240
into it as I was, though, but I was playing the demo, and I was like, this is cool.

2384
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:19,720
Yeah, they have a little cinematic teaser or something, or maybe an intro, or one of

2385
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:24,120
the cutscenes in the game, but they have it where, you know, the main guy, cause it kinda

2386
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:28,640
reminds me a lot of, like, the forts unleashed, almost, you know, he's chasing after these

2387
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:35,240
guys on light cycles and stuff, and one of the recognizers, and, you know, he's chasing

2388
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:38,800
after them, and all of a sudden, you know, he kills one of them with the disc on the

2389
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:45,480
actual light cycle, and then they start shooting at him, he jumps up, like runs along the wall,

2390
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:49,980
and then transforms back into the light cycle again, it's just fucking sweet.

2391
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:53,300
I gotta admit, every time, like, I've been to the movies a couple times lately, and that

2392
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:57,040
trailer usually plays, and every time they show the trailer for the new Tron movie, I

2393
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:00,400
get a little stiffy, it looks awesome.

2394
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:07,120
We need to see that in 3D, IMAX, in with those D-Box motion seats, just do the full shebang.

2395
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:12,280
As soon as those tickets go on sale, like, I'm almost wanting to go to L.A. just to see

2396
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:17,200
it at the official Disney theater, cause I'm that crazy.

2397
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:18,200
I'd go with you.

2398
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:19,200
I know you would.

2399
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,200
If you paid for gas.

2400
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:22,200
Maybe.

2401
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,200
We'll see.

2402
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,200
Really?

2403
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:25,200
We'll see.

2404
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,200
You gotta pay your own way into Disneyland if we go by there, but, we'll figure that

2405
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:28,200
out.

2406
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,200
We may not have two.

2407
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,200
We'll see, we'll see.

2408
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:34,440
Alright, speaking of Disneyland, now here, now Dark Sakura, as if that wasn't enough,

2409
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:35,440
wait for this.

2410
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:38,000
It's a Tron world, after all.

2411
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,200
Yeah, they are actually putting Tron in Disneyland.

2412
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:43,480
No people movers not coming back, sadly.

2413
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:47,960
Get this, Electronica launches in October.

2414
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,920
It's the digital dance party.

2415
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:54,760
It's going in Disney California Adventure, and they're gonna turn the Hollywood section

2416
02:00:54,760 --> 02:01:01,000
of California Adventure into this whole, like, Tron section, it's like a big dance party.

2417
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,120
They're gonna do a recreation of Flynn Arcade.

2418
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:08,840
It'll be at Electronica, and, uh, yeah, it's gonna be this huge event that starts October

2419
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,840
8th.

2420
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:10,840
I better have all the games in there.

2421
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:11,840
And this is what pisses me off.

2422
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,920
That's a week after I'm gonna be there anyway for gay days.

2423
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,920
So mad.

2424
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:16,920
Bitches.

2425
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:18,720
But, that means I have to go back.

2426
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:22,960
So it's October 8th until, I think, we need to go.

2427
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,440
Like, are we that crazy?

2428
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:25,440
Yes.

2429
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,440
Yes.

2430
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:27,440
We're going.

2431
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:28,800
So there'll be no show the week the Tron movie comes out because Dark Sakura and I

2432
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:34,480
are gonna go see, uh, see it at the official 3D Disney theater in Anaheim.

2433
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,480
Yes.

2434
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:36,480
Yes, we are.

2435
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:37,480
Wow.

2436
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:42,040
We're gonna travel across country to see a movie in a theater.

2437
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:43,040
Yes.

2438
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,160
We're worse than the Twilight fans in some regards.

2439
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:51,840
If only we could do that here and see a movie in a theater.

2440
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:56,360
But you don't understand because then when it's over, we can go to the Electronica party,

2441
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:59,540
and then we can ride Space Mountain a million times.

2442
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:02,760
They should actually redo Space Mountain as Tron Mountain for the movie.

2443
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:07,060
Well there's a rumor that if the Tron thing is really successful and the movie does really

2444
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:10,920
well that the Tomorrowland arcade is going to permanently be Flynn's arcade.

2445
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,280
That will make me completely giddy.

2446
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:15,280
Yeah.

2447
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,280
I think that's the way it should be too.

2448
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,280
So everybody is.

2449
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:20,880
I hope that the reproduction Flynn's that they do is gonna have all the old games and

2450
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:21,880
everything too.

2451
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:22,880
I don't care.

2452
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:27,520
It apparently is the same as our game that's been at like Comic Con and some of that stuff

2453
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,880
has been traveling around a little bit.

2454
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,020
But I don't care if this new Tron movie is terrible.

2455
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:36,720
You all need to satisfy like what I've built it up in my mind of seeing this as a child

2456
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:39,440
and you all need to go see this movie opening day so it does well.

2457
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,760
And dude, it's twice.

2458
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:42,320
It's Flynn's the bad guy.

2459
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,280
At least I think he is.

2460
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,280
Or is he?

2461
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,560
It might be a clone.

2462
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:49,200
It's Clues the bad guy.

2463
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:50,200
All right.

2464
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:51,200
Anyway.

2465
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,200
Yeah.

2466
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:53,200
I'm so excited.

2467
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:56,600
Takeo Ray is in our chat room saying, oh, the marathon's affecting Sky already.

2468
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:58,800
Stiffy's crazy trips to Disneyland.

2469
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,800
It's over.

2470
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:00,800
Uh, chat.orangeontrader.com.

2471
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,440
Uh, let's see.

2472
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,440
Break Man.

2473
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,660
Disney's gonna make a live nerd dance party.

2474
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:06,920
Yes they are.

2475
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:07,920
Nerd dance party.

2476
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:11,080
And you know if Dark Soccer and I are gonna be there, it's an extra nerd dance party.

2477
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:13,920
We need to figure out what day that is and like announce our arrival well in advance.

2478
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,480
We need sparkly silver clothes.

2479
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,580
Cause we need to get some of our LA peeps to gum.

2480
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:18,580
We need Marissa.

2481
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:19,580
We need Marissa.

2482
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:21,620
Uh, to, to shake her boobies at this.

2483
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:26,200
We need DJ Tyrant to show up and, and write a story for the website once every six months

2484
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,200
or so.

2485
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,200
Disneyland friends.

2486
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,200
People who work there.

2487
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,200
Yes.

2488
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,200
We love you.

2489
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,200
Yeah.

2490
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,960
We need, we need our cast member friends that work there to show up.

2491
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,840
We need a, I know we have other LA listeners, so we're going to figure out what day this

2492
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:38,960
is and the minute tickets go on sales.

2493
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:39,960
We got to get them.

2494
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:40,960
Okay.

2495
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:41,960
You're doing this.

2496
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,960
Oh my God.

2497
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:43,960
I'm so excited.

2498
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:44,960
Maybe Scott can come with you.

2499
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,960
Scott's in LA.

2500
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:46,960
Yeah.

2501
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,960
There we go.

2502
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:48,960
I don't know.

2503
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,440
I don't know if this, of course I'm making all these plans while Dan's in the other room

2504
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:58,840
going, probably going the fuck she is, Dan, we're going to go see Tron at Disneyland.

2505
02:03:58,840 --> 02:03:59,840
Okay.

2506
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,080
He said, Oh, we have it on the air.

2507
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:03,480
Dan, I'll take it.

2508
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,480
Put Dan in the car.

2509
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,480
Dan's coming with us.

2510
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:07,480
I don't care.

2511
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:08,480
We ain't working.

2512
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,480
All right.

2513
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:10,480
Anyhow.

2514
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:14,520
Spazinator in chat says Sky will try to get Loki to build him a real light cycle.

2515
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:15,520
I just might.

2516
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,520
All right.

2517
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:17,520
I don't know how to build motorcycles.

2518
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,520
Well, you better learn real quick.

2519
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:20,520
Okay.

2520
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:23,520
Let's move on with some other quick stories that was supposed to be a quick story ended

2521
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,520
up taking like 15 minutes.

2522
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:25,520
Dark Sakura.

2523
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:31,880
Namco is remaking arcade classics actually, um, coming out for we is going to be Namco

2524
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:39,600
museum mega mix, which has, um, different remixed games, um, like the Gallagher remix,

2525
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:42,120
um, the Pac-Man rail shooter thing.

2526
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:48,200
Um, there's also going to be though, um, an old school game called Grobda remix, which

2527
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:50,160
is a shimupi game.

2528
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,160
So yay.

2529
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:55,560
Also of course, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally X, Galaga, wah wah.

2530
02:04:55,560 --> 02:05:01,200
And then, um, for Sims 3 fans like myself, Barnacle Bay, they're getting on the big pirate

2531
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,360
bandwagon.

2532
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:06,160
And you know what my theory about this is, is that, okay, they're putting out downloadable

2533
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:13,040
content so that you can have a, you know, like a, it's a whole town of piratey goodness,

2534
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:16,560
but I think they're really getting the inspiration from all these players that have made their

2535
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,360
own pirate stuff.

2536
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:22,340
So there's like, oh, we'll do it too.

2537
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:24,960
So anyway, it's going to be, uh, coming out.

2538
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,720
Can you make Johnny Depp walk the plank?

2539
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:27,720
I wish.

2540
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:33,320
Um, and then, um, for, uh, people who may be a little bit pissed off with Xbox in September,

2541
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:35,040
there's Halo freebies.

2542
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,480
Yay.

2543
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:42,320
So with the launch of Halo Reach, um, it's going to be, uh, uh, the 14th through 20th

2544
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:49,640
will be invasion week and, um, you get new gear, exciting content, help Microsoft, spectacular

2545
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:52,560
prizes, and a chance to play with creators of the game.

2546
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:54,200
And that was a quote.

2547
02:05:54,200 --> 02:06:01,520
Um, also Xbox live gold, um, uh, features to silver members on September 17th, 2017

2548
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,280
through 20th.

2549
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:06,880
And anyone who gets online can download the invasion theme.

2550
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:12,960
Um, I just see master chiefs running around in party hats.

2551
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:18,880
Also as well, um, resident evil five avatar outfits and game add ons will be discounted.

2552
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:25,640
September 13th puzzle games, um, uh, we'll be getting the, uh, DOTW deal best to move

2553
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:32,200
live puzzle Chronicles tower blocks, deluxe or knock down, um, to 400 Microsoft points,

2554
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:40,680
five bucks and gerrymancers going from a 1200 to 800 and then a rock band three avatar stuff.

2555
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:48,000
And, uh, I also on the marketplaces bully scholarship edition and cabellas African safari,

2556
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,040
which isn't Africa.

2557
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:53,720
Speaking of all this, are we allowed to talk about what I'm dance playing in the front

2558
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:54,720
room right now?

2559
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,360
Or is that like a no, no topic?

2560
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:57,360
No, no.

2561
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:58,360
Okay.

2562
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,360
No, no.

2563
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:00,360
Nevermind.

2564
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:01,360
This completely unrelated to what we were just talking about.

2565
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:06,120
I mean, we can talk about it, but I don't know where he got it.

2566
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:07,120
Me neither.

2567
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:08,120
Oh, sweet.

2568
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:13,360
Oh, we're getting more people committing to coming to all this could be awesome.

2569
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,360
All right.

2570
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,360
Anyhow.

2571
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,360
Um, let's move on.

2572
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,840
Uh, did you have a story you want to do?

2573
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:20,840
Loki?

2574
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:21,840
Yeah, sure.

2575
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,840
Oh wait, I got to do Twitter topics.

2576
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:23,840
Oh my gosh.

2577
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,840
I don't want to forget the tweets.

2578
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:25,840
Let's do Twitter topics.

2579
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:26,840
Okay.

2580
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:27,840
That'll give you a little more time to think about that story.

2581
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:35,320
Twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to send us a tweet, we only have a few tonight probably

2582
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:36,640
because I said, don't send us links.

2583
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:37,640
Also.

2584
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:41,080
I don't think I could, I'd be, I don't think tiger claws and chat tonight, like, is he

2585
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:42,080
okay?

2586
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,440
He might've, he probably went on vacation for labor day.

2587
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,440
Like most people do.

2588
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:49,000
So I'm just, I, every night I expect to see links from tiger claw.

2589
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
They're not there tonight.

2590
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,280
So I was, I just, what do we need to send a search party to his home?

2591
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:57,760
Cause this is not typical, but I think he's, I think he's probably on a trip.

2592
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,440
All right, let's move on.

2593
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:08,200
Uh, our, our good buddy, uh, Jay Jugo and uh, on Twitter is saying breakdown for the

2594
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:12,680
wind by OLR because they're playing the old school, uh, music tonight from our old rotation,

2595
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:16,760
which is all the old, uh, all the old Bahmani music and so forth.

2596
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:22,360
Uh, Marin Marvel speaking of people we may or may not see at the Tron thing is OLR marathon

2597
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:25,120
night, a horrible night to have a curse.

2598
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,120
Yes.

2599
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:29,560
Um, what curse, what would be a bad curse to have during the, what would be a bad curse

2600
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:31,600
to have during the OLR marathon?

2601
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,600
Literary vampires.

2602
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:35,240
Probably diarrhea would be a bad curse to have actually during this night.

2603
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:38,240
So we better not get pizza.

2604
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:40,240
All right.

2605
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:44,160
Um, let's see more, uh, tweets here.

2606
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:49,400
Leo Shen sends us a tweet, blaze blue continuum shift two announced for arcades and three

2607
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:51,120
new characters are on the way.

2608
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:54,400
He does link us to the official website and I don't think this is a story that even comes

2609
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,400
up later.

2610
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:59,160
The, now the official website is all in Japanese, so I can't say a whole lot else with this,

2611
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:04,000
but, uh, for those of you guys that are fans of this series, you played this game, right?

2612
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,120
Uh, Alan, I think Loki, you might have a little bit too.

2613
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:12,320
I have, yeah, I have the, um, the arcade version on my cabinet.

2614
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,880
Did you have this one game fly one week?

2615
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:17,800
It was the very first game I got with game fly and I brought it over to your house.

2616
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:19,760
So I guess that weekend a new one coming out.

2617
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:20,760
So that's pretty cool.

2618
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:21,760
All right.

2619
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:27,800
Uh, tail Ray sends us a tweet, would y'all be interested in doing the extra life marathon

2620
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:28,800
this year?

2621
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:33,760
Donations go to your local CMN hospital, which if I'm not mistaken is children's miracle

2622
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:34,760
network.

2623
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:35,760
I think.

2624
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,240
Uh, I do remember these tweets from last year.

2625
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:39,560
God, has it been a year already?

2626
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:40,560
I guess so.

2627
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,720
Uh, October 16th.

2628
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,720
Whew.

2629
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:46,600
Um, it depends.

2630
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,600
We do.

2631
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,680
We try to do this last year and something happened.

2632
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:53,000
Uh, yeah, it just didn't work out.

2633
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Something happened.

2634
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
It didn't work out.

2635
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,480
Um, uh, if we can't participate directly, we'll definitely donate at least.

2636
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:04,320
Uh, but we'll see, I don't want to commit just yet, especially after doing a marathon

2637
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:05,320
tonight.

2638
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:09,400
Um, I don't know if we could do like a full, full, full marathon, especially ever having

2639
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:10,400
just done one tonight.

2640
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,400
We should have waited, huh?

2641
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:14,120
Uh, but we'll see.

2642
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:17,200
I just don't want to promise and not have it happen cause that's happened before and

2643
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:19,960
it felt like we felt really poopy doing that.

2644
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,760
So, but we'll see.

2645
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:25,000
If nothing else, we will mention it lots on the show and help donate.

2646
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,160
Uh, Spazinator PSN sends us some tweets.

2647
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:33,200
For those that have a PS3 and care, there's an episode of Campus PD on the PSN store that's

2648
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,920
temporarily free.

2649
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:36,920
It's under TV shows and free.

2650
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:39,180
Hey, I like free things.

2651
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:40,180
That's good.

2652
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,840
Campus PD is like cops, but with more boobs.

2653
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,320
Is there, is that what it really is?

2654
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:45,020
Yeah, that's what Campus PD is.

2655
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:46,020
It's wow.

2656
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:47,880
And interestingly enough, it's on G4.

2657
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:49,800
Oh, wow.

2658
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,640
This is what I watched early in the morning.

2659
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,280
Drunken sorority chicks?

2660
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:58,080
It's it's basically just cops on, like there was an episode of that I watched that they

2661
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:04,200
were busting some guys for having, you know, pot in a frat house or something like that

2662
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,960
because they saw it through a window.

2663
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,760
And so they came in and it was just a bunch of hippie college kids complaining that you

2664
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,840
don't have the right to enter my premises, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2665
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,840
It's in plain sight.

2666
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:16,840
I see it right here.

2667
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:19,920
Therefore, it gives us, you know, probable cause to enter your residence.

2668
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:24,000
So shut the fuck up, Mr. Law Major.

2669
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,260
Pot in a frat house?

2670
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:26,260
You don't say.

2671
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:27,260
I know.

2672
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:28,260
Get out.

2673
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:29,260
Get right out of town.

2674
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:30,260
It was.

2675
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:31,260
No.

2676
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:32,260
Oh, my gosh.

2677
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:36,280
I just used to call stuff like that VCRs.

2678
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:39,320
We called my friends rats VCRs.

2679
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:42,280
Next thing you tell me, there's going to be underage drinking in the dormitories.

2680
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:43,280
Don't.

2681
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:46,400
And then they have the new season that has, they have the spring break season that's coming

2682
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:47,400
out this fall.

2683
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:53,840
That's basically just more chicks and if you've watched Cops in like Mardi Gras or whatever,

2684
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:59,000
they have that episode or whatever, Ho Ho Ho, their special, like, you know, episodes

2685
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,120
with all the prostitutes that they're picking up and stuff.

2686
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:05,080
Put your top back on, ma'am.

2687
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,080
Ma'am.

2688
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,120
Put your shirt back on, ma'am.

2689
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:09,120
Come with me, ma'am.

2690
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:11,880
We had anything to drink tonight, ma'am.

2691
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:12,880
Yeah.

2692
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:16,240
I mean, it's, yeah.

2693
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:17,240
Wonderful programming.

2694
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:18,240
This is what they put.

2695
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,320
Can you believe Cops is still on?

2696
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:25,640
Like Cops started like when Fox Network started in like 87 and it is still on.

2697
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:27,760
Well, that America's most wanted.

2698
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:28,760
Still going.

2699
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:29,760
That's true.

2700
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,200
John Walsh, John Walsh still hosted after all these years?

2701
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:33,200
Probably.

2702
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:36,560
Didn't they finally find who killed his son like just not that long ago and it turned

2703
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,560
out the guy died?

2704
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:42,920
Well, the guy that was already in prison, I think, kept confessing and then recanting

2705
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:46,600
it like four times so they couldn't, but yeah, it's probably on his Wikipedia.

2706
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:47,600
Oh, probably.

2707
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:49,680
That was a horrible story, though, what happened?

2708
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:50,680
Yeah.

2709
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,680
Because he was, it actually involves video games.

2710
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:53,680
He was playing like an Atari 2600 when he got kidnapped, right?

2711
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,680
Or something like that, at a Sears or something?

2712
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,680
I think so.

2713
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:57,680
Or watching other kids play it, I think?

2714
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:58,680
I don't know.

2715
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:59,680
Anyway.

2716
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:00,680
Sorry.

2717
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:01,680
Don't mean to be a downer on the show.

2718
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:02,680
Wah wah.

2719
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:03,680
Wah wah.

2720
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,680
Wah wah.

2721
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:05,680
That was it for the Twitter topics.

2722
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:09,320
We'll have more tweets later on in the evening at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2723
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:11,960
I'll be tweeting random stuff and Klingon, by the way.

2724
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:12,960
Thank you.

2725
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:13,960
From mine.

2726
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:16,600
Dark Tetsuya says that Salacious Pop does a great state trooper.

2727
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:18,560
There you go.

2728
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:19,560
Ma'am, please.

2729
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:23,200
Ma'am, don't walk, don't run out into the street, ma'am.

2730
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,200
Put your shirt on.

2731
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:25,880
Into the car, ma'am.

2732
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:28,600
Brakeman in the chat says, ma'am, please put your shirt back on.

2733
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:32,800
Oh, sorry, I meant sir.

2734
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,600
Clearly that individual had moobs.

2735
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:35,600
Alright.

2736
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:39,400
Loki, do you have some more news for us?

2737
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:40,400
Yes.

2738
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:44,600
Music Unlimited is a service that's rumored, well, was rumored to be coming to the Sony

2739
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:45,600
platforms.

2740
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:48,880
It is now confirmed to be coming to the Sony platforms, as opposed to PlayStation 3 and

2741
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,480
PSP.

2742
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:59,360
It is, I guess, powered by curiosity, which is not a word, but according to Sony it is.

2743
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:05,480
It is apparently going to be a music service that's cloud based that'll, at least it'll

2744
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:11,640
be coming out in Europe, and subscribers will have access to millions of songs, and then

2745
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:16,240
of course it's going to be very similar to kind of the Zoom pass that's on, you know,

2746
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:17,920
Microsoft service.

2747
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:23,160
And so in addition, the service will be compatible with Bravia TVs, Blu-ray disc players, home

2748
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:29,280
theater systems, and Vio computers, with one single account without a need to manage digital

2749
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,740
files so you can listen to a bunch of stuff.

2750
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:36,160
So am I correct in assuming this is just more of that corporate synergy with Sony music?

2751
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:37,160
I think so, yeah.

2752
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:41,600
And so probably a movie thing is, well I guess they already have movies on Sony Marketplace,

2753
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:45,000
so I guess, never mind, but maybe more TV.

2754
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Just want a piece of the apple pie.

2755
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,960
Piece of the apple pie.

2756
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:51,200
All coming together.

2757
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:57,040
I mean, I guess if they've had movies and TV all this time, I mean, where the hell's

2758
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,040
the music been?

2759
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:02,200
Once in a while they'll have like a game soundtrack or something, but you know, they haven't done

2760
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,600
a major music store at all, that's for sure.

2761
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:09,880
They haven't done anything major on their services.

2762
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:12,400
So yeah, I don't know.

2763
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:13,400
Alright.

2764
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:18,800
Well, let's move on and talk about, going back to the iPhone stuff a little bit, I actually

2765
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:23,080
have, I used to play this game a lot, it was Aurora Faint, it was kind of a Bejeweledy

2766
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,840
type game that they have on the iPhone.

2767
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:27,320
Well these guys are really taking these to the next level.

2768
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:33,000
They've written their own platform called Open Faint, which is sort of what you could

2769
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,120
say inspired the whole Game Center thing that Apple is set to launch, I believe next week,

2770
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:41,800
which in turn is sort of their version of Xbox Live.

2771
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,920
Open Faint, of course, trying to be competitive with the press conference and some of the

2772
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:49,760
news about Game Center that came out, has announced their own deal here.

2773
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:54,200
Aurora Faint is making Open Faint and it's called Playtime is this new thing.

2774
02:15:54,200 --> 02:16:02,600
It's going to be a real-time multiplayer gameplay, get this, between iOS and Android devices.

2775
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:07,640
It's bridging the gap and that's something Game Center, you know, is never going to do.

2776
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:09,360
So Playtime is actually going to bridge that gap.

2777
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:14,960
It will allow real-time voice chat during the gameplay across these platforms.

2778
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:19,940
CEO Jason Citrone of Aurora Faint said, quote, traditionally, multiplayer technology has

2779
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:22,560
been accessible only to top-tier developers.

2780
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:25,040
It's just too complicated and time-consuming.

2781
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:31,720
So he invented Playtime, which literally takes one day to integrate into a casual game.

2782
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:36,320
More information about this, VoIP lobbies and matchmaking for casual games, expanding

2783
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:41,920
to incorporate team-based voice chat, 16-player game servers for the core titles.

2784
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,600
So it definitely sounds like they're trying to build this thing up.

2785
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,400
And as far as I know, it doesn't cost money.

2786
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:46,400
Here's the thing, though.

2787
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:51,300
The games I've noticed on my phone that do support this, it kind of gets in the way.

2788
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:56,400
You only have so much real estate on the iPhone screen and I sort of get annoyed when I try

2789
02:16:56,400 --> 02:17:01,280
to launch a game and I get this whole, register now for Open Faint, you do do.

2790
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:05,200
And I'm just like, fuck off, I want to play my Commodore 64 emulator.

2791
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:12,040
You know, I don't need VoIP to play The Last Ninja on the Commodore 64, get out.

2792
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:16,560
So some of it is kind of annoying, like they need to tone it down a little bit.

2793
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:18,240
You know, it's nice that it's there.

2794
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,560
This technology is cool.

2795
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:23,480
I think it's great that they're bridging the gap, but don't throw it in my face.

2796
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:28,800
Like stop, have it a little button in the corner that I can use.

2797
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:32,840
I guess it hides once you do kind of sign in, it's just annoying.

2798
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:37,920
I don't like trying to go into a game for the first time and it's like, sign up!

2799
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,560
Like Tap Tap Revenge 3 I tried playing for the first time and it's like, sign up for

2800
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:47,520
Tapulous and connect to your Facebook and like, fuck off!

2801
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:51,040
I just want to tap my screen in time to stuff.

2802
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,040
What are you looking at over there, DarkStalker?

2803
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:53,040
Is that that...

2804
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:54,040
Epic Citadel.

2805
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:56,000
Oh, the Epic Citadel thing we were just talking about earlier?

2806
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
That's pretty damn nice.

2807
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Nice.

2808
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Maybe I'll take some screen captures.

2809
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,360
We'll see.

2810
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:04,360
Let's see.

2811
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:10,660
I have no idea how to pronounce this, Beta CNCRA, it says, I don't care about ads, they

2812
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,880
should go die.

2813
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:12,880
Go away ads.

2814
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:17,140
Well, I understand that ads are what it takes to support some free things, but some of these

2815
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:19,760
like open, faint games are things I pay for.

2816
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:21,520
And that's where things get really annoying.

2817
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,520
So I'm just saying.

2818
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:24,520
Anyhow.

2819
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:27,920
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com if you want to chat with us live here at Orange Lawns Radio as

2820
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:32,340
we tape our super long episode today, Labor Day Weekend.

2821
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:35,400
Dark Soccer, are you going to have to put that down and talk about what you've got in

2822
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:36,400
gaming news?

2823
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,400
Stuff.

2824
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,400
Like?

2825
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:42,680
Hey, can you give me a chance to finish?

2826
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:50,920
Well, you know, American McGee is doing another Alice game, Alice Madness Returns.

2827
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:56,400
But it's going to be not over the top, so they're saying.

2828
02:18:56,400 --> 02:19:00,760
It's going to be adult and mature.

2829
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:06,280
But it's definitely going to be an M-rated title, but it's not like they're doing it

2830
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,220
just to make it an M-rated title.

2831
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:16,560
They want it to be, you know, with the established universe, but have it be something more for

2832
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:18,120
an adult to grasp.

2833
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:19,120
Not for kids.

2834
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:21,380
It's not Disney.

2835
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:28,220
And they don't want to make it extra violent, extra gory, extra bloody.

2836
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:35,080
They want the content itself, the subject matter, to be where it gets the M-rating.

2837
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:38,200
If that makes sense.

2838
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:39,680
I think it's going to be fun.

2839
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:44,320
I mean, it's not going to be like over the top Mortal Kombat style blood, but they still,

2840
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:46,000
you know, Alice is still going to cut things, right?

2841
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,640
I'm sure if she stabs something, it'll bleed.

2842
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:51,080
Just won't, you know, gush a geyser of blood.

2843
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,360
I'm really not sure how to take a news story like that.

2844
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:57,760
It's like they're saying like, well, we're not trying to go for a mature rating, but

2845
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:01,960
our game will have mature content, but it's necessary to the plot.

2846
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:06,000
That's like telling an actress, like, your topless scene is integral to the plot.

2847
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Like it's.

2848
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
It always is.

2849
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,480
It's statistically important to the story that you're naked in this scene.

2850
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:18,040
Highbrow going for exactly like, you know, when the killer gets you in the shower, you

2851
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:21,680
see, you need to be topless because you're in the shower.

2852
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:30,400
Like I'm talking about like dealing with like mental illness or an abusive childhood topless

2853
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:36,940
scenes or I agree the type of the type of topic though considered mature and adult would

2854
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:42,000
be something like the character itself is supposed to be kind of nuts and living a very

2855
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,560
unhappy life.

2856
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:45,840
And a brothel full of topless women.

2857
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:51,400
Well, usually the the protagonists in Silent Hill games, once you finally find out what

2858
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:54,880
their origin is, it's like, whoa, that's really messed up.

2859
02:20:54,880 --> 02:21:03,120
He did what to his wife or like the little girl who her special bad guy was the the daddy

2860
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:06,880
chained to the door with the knife trying to do dirty things.

2861
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:12,560
Takeo Ray in our chat room says the 3D boobs in Piranha 3D were very important to its plot.

2862
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:16,960
That's a movie I haven't seen yet, but I think I need to, even though I think that a lot

2863
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:22,440
of those gore movies are kind of stupid, like it's like when it knows it's over the top.

2864
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:26,160
Sometimes they're really funny, but sometimes you got to have boobs in there just to show

2865
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:27,160
your cheese.

2866
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:31,540
But what I don't understand is that they're like, there's actually a version.

2867
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:32,540
This was great.

2868
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:33,540
It was in the local paper.

2869
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:36,120
They were talking about the local drive ins and how they're still going.

2870
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:40,040
And they were showing Piranha at the drive in, but it's not 3D because you can't do 3D

2871
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:41,040
on a drive in screen.

2872
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:45,540
And they were interviewing this lady who took her, it had nothing to do with this fact,

2873
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:46,540
but it should have.

2874
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:50,800
She took her six and eight year old to go see Piranha.

2875
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:53,720
And I'm not one to tell you what to do with your kids, but at the same time, I couldn't

2876
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:57,640
help and look at that, but go really, really bad parenting.

2877
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:03,040
You're going to take your six year old to go see Piranha and it's not even in 3D.

2878
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,040
Does that make it better?

2879
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:05,140
I don't know.

2880
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:10,000
And then you take them to the lake the next day and then they don't want to go to the

2881
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
lake anymore.

2882
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,240
Dartetsuya says, oh, speaking of gore movies, apparently Saw is getting a 3D version.

2883
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:16,240
Do not want.

2884
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:17,240
I heard that.

2885
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:18,240
Do not want.

2886
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:19,240
See, there's one.

2887
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:22,440
See, I like it when it's over the top, but I don't like it when it tries to be real like

2888
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:23,440
Saw does.

2889
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:24,440
Do you want to see Machete?

2890
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:25,440
I want to see Machete.

2891
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:30,160
Derek H in chat says Machete has fake Lindsay Lohan boobs.

2892
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:33,880
I heard there was nudity from La Lohan in that.

2893
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:39,240
As I described, as I described Machete this morning, it's a movie based off a trailer

2894
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:42,440
based off a fake movie.

2895
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:43,440
Definitely want to see it.

2896
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:44,440
You know what else is cool?

2897
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:47,520
They saw a new trailer for Hobo with a Shotgun.

2898
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:48,520
What?

2899
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:49,520
Yeah.

2900
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:51,440
Hobo with a Shotgun is also from Grindhouse.

2901
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:56,060
It was actually, they had a contest to have people create a fan trailer and that was the

2902
02:22:56,060 --> 02:22:59,640
one that won and now it's actually going to become a real movie.

2903
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:00,640
Hobo with a Shotgun.

2904
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:01,640
Wow.

2905
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:02,880
Can I, can I share some news real quick?

2906
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,240
I guess.

2907
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:09,000
For players who play Star Trek Online, the C store is having a Labor Day sale, so I just

2908
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,640
thought I'd share.

2909
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:13,240
For all two of you that are playing Star Trek Online.

2910
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:14,240
Hey!

2911
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:21,400
Alright, moving on, Loki and me and then the mailbag at mailbagatorangeontradio.com.

2912
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:24,080
Oh yes.

2913
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:31,520
So you know, of course the Microsoft, you know, summer gaming thing worked out really

2914
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:37,920
well for them, so they're going to do it again, but this time in the fall.

2915
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:42,960
And they're going to call it the Microsoft Xbox Live Arcade Game Feast Promotion.

2916
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:45,040
And there will be of course a bunch of games coming out.

2917
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:52,800
It's I guess starting September 29th with Hydrophobia for 1200 Microsoft points, followed

2918
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:58,160
by Comic Jumper on October 6th, also for 1200 Microsoft points.

2919
02:23:58,160 --> 02:24:02,400
Pinball FX 2 will be available October 13th, and guess what?

2920
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,200
It's free!

2921
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:08,520
And you can import your tables from the first Pinball FX game with each additional table

2922
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,720
being purchased individually.

2923
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,400
Well I like free!

2924
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:12,880
Free is good!

2925
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:20,600
Finally, also Super Meat Boy will be coming out October 20th to wrap the whole thing up.

2926
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:24,840
So that'll also be 1200 Microsoft points.

2927
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:29,120
Hopefully we'll be able to give you guys previews on each of these games soon because I've played

2928
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:35,480
most of them already, so we will talk about them in coming weeks.

2929
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,480
Alrighty.

2930
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:41,760
Any of those games you think are worth buying based off of what you've played so far?

2931
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:42,880
Comic Jumper was kind of fun.

2932
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:49,240
It was a beat-em-up game, it has a really neat looking, it's kind of like a, oh, Comic

2933
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:52,920
Zone but HD-ish.

2934
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:55,800
The main character is kind of weird looking though.

2935
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:58,400
He looks like a Ninja Turtle almost.

2936
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:07,400
Ninja Turtle crossed with like, I don't know, some sort of Flash Gordon and Deadpool.

2937
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,760
And then Super Meat Boy is supposed to be really good.

2938
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:12,000
I was just disappointed that it was broken on a, you know.

2939
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,120
Well it won't stay broken forever.

2940
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:16,560
Yeah, it'll fix it eventually.

2941
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,200
And Hydrophobia, I don't know about Hydrophobia.

2942
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:25,760
Hey, price drop, the DSI and the DSI extra-large are going to be getting a, excuse me, hiccup

2943
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,760
at a bad time.

2944
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:27,760
Whoops.

2945
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:31,040
In North America, the DSI and DSI extra-large are getting a price drop.

2946
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:35,280
It's effective September 12th, so not just yet but real soon.

2947
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:41,720
The handhelds will now be 150 for the DSI and 170 for the DSI XL.

2948
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:44,100
Time to clear out that inventory before the 3DS comes out.

2949
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:46,600
It's exactly what this is all about.

2950
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:49,600
Price drops have also already happened in the UK and Japan.

2951
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:52,020
I believe Australia had one as well.

2952
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:56,600
So we're kind of the last one to be able to get on board with this.

2953
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:00,680
This is to drive sales during the holiday season for those parents that aren't really

2954
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:03,680
up and up on the stuff that's coming out in gaming.

2955
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:08,640
And so they will spend their money and buy a DSI XL and then the 3DS will come out and

2956
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:09,880
they'll have to buy that too.

2957
02:26:09,880 --> 02:26:12,280
So it's a win-win.

2958
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:15,240
So yay, price drops and all that good stuff.

2959
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:18,120
All right, let's move on to the mailbag.

2960
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:22,960
Every week you guys send us emails and you know, if we feel like it, we'll read them.

2961
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:27,180
No, we all, of course, of course we're going to read emails from you guys.

2962
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:30,360
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send those emails.

2963
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:35,360
We're going to have Dark Sakura open up the old mailbag and dive in and pull out a letter

2964
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:44,680
right now, but not until I play the music.

2965
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:49,720
We actually got two emails, but I figured maybe in two hours I'll check the email, the

2966
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:50,720
mailbox again.

2967
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:51,720
Sure.

2968
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:52,720
Yeah.

2969
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:56,120
If you want to send more emails, we'll, we'll check for more emails later on tonight.

2970
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:57,120
Sure.

2971
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:58,520
Um, first one.

2972
02:26:58,520 --> 02:26:59,520
Hello.

2973
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:01,200
I can finally listen live to your show.

2974
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,640
OLR starts at 3 AM on Monday in Belgium.

2975
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:05,400
Still, I can't call in tonight.

2976
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:06,400
I'll wake everyone.

2977
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:07,800
Show starts at 11 PM.

2978
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:10,320
Anyways, I have a question for Loki.

2979
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:15,480
I have all Sega guns, light phaser, menacer, stunner, slash virtua gun, and the dreamcast

2980
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:16,480
gun.

2981
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:20,400
My problem is that none of these guns, except for the menacer, work on newer TVs.

2982
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:23,760
I currently don't have room for an old TV, so I was wondering if I could make these guns

2983
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:26,680
work on a modern LCD TV.

2984
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:27,680
And I'll just go ahead and close the email.

2985
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:29,240
Thanks for a weekly OLR, you guys.

2986
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:30,240
You're so awesome.

2987
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:31,240
Cyberbeast, Belgium.

2988
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:32,240
No, you can't.

2989
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:33,240
Sorry.

2990
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:39,040
And that's unfortunate, but you're not going to be able to do that because newer guns that

2991
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:45,600
they have out now basically kind of have little light sensor bars or some sort of sensor bar

2992
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:48,200
that attaches to the TV that you would use.

2993
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:49,200
It's like Wii style.

2994
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:55,780
Yeah, it's like the Wii or even if you want to go even older school, like the Power Glove.

2995
02:27:55,780 --> 02:28:02,360
It's basically just something because they can't do the refresh stuff on the TVs anymore,

2996
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:04,620
so that's what the solution is now.

2997
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:10,320
So unfortunately, you're not going to be able to use those on newer TVs.

2998
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:12,320
That should answer the question.

2999
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:13,320
Last email.

3000
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:14,320
Hey guys.

3001
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:15,760
Molten Brown here.

3002
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:19,040
I was just- Ew.

3003
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:20,840
It could be chocolate.

3004
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:21,840
I hope so.

3005
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:25,680
I was just listening to your last show and I wanted to take a shot at figuring out THQ's

3006
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:27,200
warped reasoning.

3007
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:30,900
Perhaps to THQ, the amount that they sell to their distributors depends on how many

3008
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:32,940
people will buy the game new.

3009
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:36,760
Since the distributors will only buy what they think they will be able to sell.

3010
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:40,480
If the distributors are having a hard time unloading the new game because people are

3011
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:45,080
buying it used, then they will decrease the amount of new games they buy from the producers.

3012
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:48,480
This means that in the end, THQ and other producers will get less money since distributors

3013
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:50,160
are buying less of their game.

3014
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:55,160
While I don't agree with this reasoning, nor THQ's stance towards used gamers, I can-

3015
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:58,760
I'm thinking of used gamers, like the gamers themselves being used.

3016
02:28:58,760 --> 02:28:59,760
I can-

3017
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:01,400
I feel so used today.

3018
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:02,400
I'm stent.

3019
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:05,440
I can buy this program.

3020
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:10,040
I can kind of see where they are coming from since they are in the business to make money.

3021
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:13,040
Sad though it is, that's what it boils down to.

3022
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:17,560
Well, keep up the good work and hopefully next time I will be awake enough to send a

3023
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:19,300
longer email with some questions.

3024
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:21,320
Your dutiful listener, Molten Brown.

3025
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:23,120
The not gross version of Molten Brown.

3026
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:28,180
Sadly, I don't think that's the case at all and here's why I don't think that.

3027
02:29:28,180 --> 02:29:32,760
Because the first game that they pulled that on was UFC 2010.

3028
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:38,200
And really, they wouldn't have announced it to anybody until the day the game was released,

3029
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:44,940
except the fact that Destructoid got a hold of, you know, I guess a source of somebody

3030
02:29:44,940 --> 02:29:49,280
who purchased the game before the street date and found out that it had this whole thing

3031
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,280
on there anyways.

3032
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:52,440
They weren't going to tell anybody about it until last minute.

3033
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:57,160
Now, if the whole thing was to drive up sales of new products, they would have had to let

3034
02:29:57,160 --> 02:30:02,200
everybody know right away or at least a lot earlier than the street date in order to get

3035
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:09,000
people to say, oh well, if I can't buy it used and connect online and have to pay this

3036
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,440
extra money, I need to go buy it new now.

3037
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:15,660
If that's their plan to drive sales up, really it's not.

3038
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:20,500
It's all about them getting some extra money for selling a used title.

3039
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:24,920
Really something that they really shouldn't have money for in the first place because

3040
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:30,040
if you are, you know, buying the game new, well, someone's got to buy the game new at

3041
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:33,800
one point and in that case, you know, the money that they would have made from that

3042
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:37,200
sale would go to, you know, supporting the online stuff.

3043
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:41,080
If someone else say, you know, if I happen to give my game to somebody else to play,

3044
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:46,720
why should they have to pay an extra $10 to basically take up as much space on their network

3045
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,200
as I was previously?

3046
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:50,600
I don't see the point.

3047
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:55,700
All it is is just a cash grab and they claim it's to make their online service better,

3048
02:30:55,700 --> 02:31:02,760
but if you can't, you know, if you can't make your online service better within the $60

3049
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:05,280
price point, then you need to raise the price of your games.

3050
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:09,920
Whether that's popular or not with your consumers, that's the risk you're going to have to take

3051
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:14,040
if that's really an issue for you, but really it doesn't come down to making their service

3052
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:18,120
better because as far as I'm aware, the UFC stuff, I don't think they've really done anything

3053
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:21,040
to their online service, made it really awesome.

3054
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:24,280
I don't think anyone's going, oh my God, the online UFC is so sweet.

3055
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:26,560
This is way better than every other game I've ever played.

3056
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:29,400
I don't think that's the case at all and I don't think that's ever going to be the case

3057
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:30,440
with this stuff.

3058
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:34,880
It's just an excuse that they're using to try to justify charging you an extra $10 if

3059
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:36,720
you buy the game used.

3060
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:42,840
So Break Man in their chat room says, quite simply, if that's a plan to drive up sales,

3061
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:43,840
it's not a very good plan.

3062
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:44,840
Yeah.

3063
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:54,480
Because if that was their intent was to drive up new sales, because the way it works, it

3064
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:59,600
goes either you're going to have your direct consumers or your direct retailers that you're

3065
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:04,000
working with, like the Game Stops and whatever, or the distributors that they're working with.

3066
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:09,280
So either way, they have customers that need to place orders with those companies, then

3067
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,080
those companies say, okay, we have X number of pieces on order, here's how many pieces

3068
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:20,040
we think we need, what we have on order plus a little bit of extra of a pad to sell later

3069
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:21,040
on.

3070
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:22,960
And that's what they place with the actual publisher.

3071
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:29,120
If their intent was on driving up new game sales, then they would have let that news

3072
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:33,420
out a lot earlier so that people would go, oh, okay, well then they need to buy a new

3073
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:40,240
version of this game instead so that I can get my online content for no additional price,

3074
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:44,720
which really doesn't make any sense anyways.

3075
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:48,200
So they would have to do that in order for that to actually be true.

3076
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:56,180
But they didn't, and now they're even talking about raising the price from $5 to $10.

3077
02:32:56,180 --> 02:32:59,760
So I think it's just a big old cash grab.

3078
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:00,880
That's all it is.

3079
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:05,440
At some point, the video game market is going to crash under the weight of all this.

3080
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:07,460
It's because they think they need some extra money.

3081
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:11,680
They think that, oh, hey, well we can make money off of each use sale because these damn

3082
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:15,240
use sales, they're cutting into our new game sales.

3083
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:19,360
Well, I don't know if that's the case at all because I think a lot of people that are planning

3084
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:23,520
on buying those use games weren't going to buy your game new anyways.

3085
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:24,520
Exactly.

3086
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:25,520
Exactly.

3087
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:31,200
And so regardless of the fact that you don't have online or online's extra or something

3088
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:35,440
like that, they may just say, you know what, I don't need that game at all, and then they'll

3089
02:33:35,440 --> 02:33:39,440
be resentful against you and not buy your product going forward.

3090
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:41,080
So it may have a negative impact.

3091
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:44,760
And I think overall, it's not a really good move, but a lot of people are going to move

3092
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:46,280
that direction anyways.

3093
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:48,280
All right.

3094
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:54,120
Let's move on to, I guess, appropriately following up all this ranting, a segment we do here

3095
02:33:54,120 --> 02:34:15,000
on the show every week called the FUs of the week, FU to having to take algebra.

3096
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:19,640
Not that it's a hard class, just that I hate math.

3097
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:24,000
FU to people that drive really slow in front of me or that are lost and don't seem to know

3098
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,000
where they're going.

3099
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:28,620
I like, I hate people that all of a sudden just cut over a couple lanes because they

3100
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:29,620
miss their turn.

3101
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:30,620
You know what?

3102
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:34,600
If you miss your turn, you need to make a U-turn and then correct it that way instead

3103
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:39,320
of just going, Oh my God, and cutting off everybody.

3104
02:34:39,320 --> 02:34:43,560
I don't really have a lot of angst, so I'll go with the driver FU to FU to SUV that totally

3105
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:45,640
cut me off merging on an I-80 today.

3106
02:34:45,640 --> 02:34:47,640
She was a bitch.

3107
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:48,640
Alan?

3108
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:51,760
Uh, FU to hot weather, I guess.

3109
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:52,760
I don't know.

3110
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:53,760
I'm pretty mellow right now.

3111
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,040
It's cause you live in Silent Hill.

3112
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:56,040
I do.

3113
02:34:56,040 --> 02:34:57,040
Where it's always cold.

3114
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:58,040
Yes.

3115
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:59,040
And I'm not lying.

3116
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:00,640
When you drive up the hill to get to Alan's house, it suddenly gets foggy.

3117
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:02,640
It could be the middle of August and it's like fog.

3118
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:04,640
Bradley, how you doing over there?

3119
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:05,640
Do you have a nephew?

3120
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,640
I have a nephew.

3121
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:09,800
I'll have no free time starting Wednesday again for a few months.

3122
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:10,800
Why is that?

3123
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:12,400
Oh, my second job starts up again.

3124
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:13,400
Oh, good times.

3125
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:14,400
Good times.

3126
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:15,400
All right.

3127
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:16,400
Good luck.

3128
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:17,400
All right.

3129
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:20,000
That's it for the FUs of the week.

3130
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,840
A few more news stories and then we'll get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3131
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:28,240
Won't be the first time tonight we'll be taking calls, but we will take some calls.

3132
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:29,240
All right.

3133
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:31,240
Uh, Loki, what do you got?

3134
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:35,280
Um, Retro City Rampage is a game that they're showing off at PAX right now.

3135
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:40,480
It's a WiiWare game that originally was supposed to be an NES title that was gonna be a port

3136
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:45,920
of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then something happened where that didn't end up coming out.

3137
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:54,040
Now it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 type of game, but it's now just all sorts

3138
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:57,120
of references for different 8-bit games that are in here.

3139
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,360
It's supposed to be coming out on WiiWare in December, but I mean they have everything

3140
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:08,820
from Contra references to Metal Gear to just all sorts of neat gameplay.

3141
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:12,760
It just looks really cool and it's all done in kind of an 8-bit style.

3142
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:18,040
And once again, actually that was the Grand Theft Auto 3 that ran on the NES is called

3143
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:23,160
Project Grand Theft Endo was the original thing.

3144
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:27,480
But it's really, really cool.

3145
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:29,560
So definitely worth checking out once it comes out.

3146
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:33,560
Hope it does actually come to Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network as they were saying.

3147
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:40,000
So that looks like a sweet game.

3148
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,200
It actually does look really sweet.

3149
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:44,800
I like those games that kind of like get in the retro, although I don't know, I wasn't

3150
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:47,760
super duper into the Scott Pilgrim game for some reason.

3151
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:53,600
Like it was okay, but maybe I didn't, I don't think I played enough of it actually, so I

3152
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:54,600
don't know.

3153
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:56,600
You're going to be picking this up though, Loki?

3154
02:36:56,600 --> 02:37:00,920
Yeah, I haven't really played the Wii in a long time, but I, I definitely.

3155
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:03,360
Mine's still not, I didn't even buy the new Metroid.

3156
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:06,760
I know that might be like shocking in awe, but I'm kind of just waiting for it to come

3157
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:08,920
out on Xbox 360.

3158
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:13,160
Like in my mind, I'm like, it'll come out on the 360 at some point.

3159
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:14,160
Right.

3160
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:15,160
Or the PS3.

3161
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:16,160
I know.

3162
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:17,160
I know.

3163
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:20,200
I'm being stupid right now, but yeah, that's it.

3164
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:23,680
And Rama's yelling at me saying, you need to play more Scott Pilgrim.

3165
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:24,680
I know.

3166
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,680
I do.

3167
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:26,680
All right.

3168
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:31,600
Going on to a one more story before the calls, you guys, uh, the fast racing league is something

3169
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:32,720
coming out on WiiWare.

3170
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:35,440
It's the futuristic fast racing league.

3171
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:36,560
Hmm.

3172
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:37,720
What could this be?

3173
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:43,160
It's a jet rocket, I guess is the, uh, folks that make the game or is this, no, no, it's,

3174
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:45,000
uh, that's the other game they made.

3175
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,120
Shinen is the name of the company.

3176
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:50,640
Uh, they're making this game, a game called fast racing league.

3177
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:52,520
All there is is promotion art.

3178
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:54,920
Uh, but there you go.

3179
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:59,200
My thought when I look at this though, is that, gee, somebody's making F zero for the

3180
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:00,200
Wii.

3181
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,080
It's that they're not just calling it F zero.

3182
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:04,400
It's it's fast racing league.

3183
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,200
It looks like wipe out to me.

3184
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:07,200
Super fast.

3185
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:11,600
Well, wipe out's kind of like F zero in a way.

3186
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:12,600
Yeah.

3187
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:15,160
It's, it's all the same type of stuff, but I mean the vehicle design looks like wipe

3188
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:16,160
out.

3189
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:17,160
You know what though?

3190
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:20,320
They need to be able to play that perfectly as a negcon.

3191
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:21,320
Seriously.

3192
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:24,200
Nothing is like playing wipe out with a negcon.

3193
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:25,200
There you go.

3194
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:30,440
All right, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on

3195
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:32,080
Skype is orange lounge radio.

3196
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:35,280
You can go ahead and give us a call and we'll be taking your calls.

3197
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:38,520
Usually this is the part of the show where I would go to last minute stories, but, um,

3198
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:42,240
we actually are tabling those tonight because we still have more stories coming up during

3199
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:43,240
the marathon.

3200
02:38:43,240 --> 02:38:47,240
Everything that was bumped tonight is coming up later during our marathon, so we'll get

3201
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:50,480
into that unless there's any late breaking news from this morning.

3202
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:52,520
I don't know if Loki has anything he wants to share from that.

3203
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:57,360
I guess we could do that, but otherwise we're just waiting for the calls to come in at 1-877-GAME-OLR

3204
02:38:57,360 --> 02:39:02,280
or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio and we'll be taking your calls.

3205
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:07,120
This is probably not the first time tonight that the Skype line will be open, uh, but

3206
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:08,120
it's open right now.

3207
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:09,120
So there you go.

3208
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:12,920
The Borderlands level caps going up from 61 to 69.

3209
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:14,040
Nice for free.

3210
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:15,520
Why isn't Borderlands an MMO?

3211
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:22,360
Usually when I hear about level caps going up, I go, Oh, it's like an MMO, uh, although

3212
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:25,120
Borderlands kind of plays like a Warcraft type game, doesn't it?

3213
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,080
Except it's like first person, but like, doesn't it have like the whole like exclamation marks

3214
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:29,800
over people's heads and all that stuff.

3215
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:35,120
And you've, you've played this game a little bit, right on your Borderlands is pretty much

3216
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:38,160
like Diablo of Diablo was a first person shooter.

3217
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:41,720
You know, you shoot someone and the number of how much damage you do and hit points appears

3218
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:42,720
over their head.

3219
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:48,760
A loot is random, so you've got to go through all the loot that you get and drop the trash.

3220
02:39:48,760 --> 02:39:49,760
It is pretty fun.

3221
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,760
Yeah.

3222
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:55,680
I was really glad to hear that I gearbox makers of Borderlands got the Duke Nukem forever

3223
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:59,240
contract because I'm a huge fan of theirs because they're the ones.

3224
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:00,240
See?

3225
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:01,240
Yeah.

3226
02:40:01,240 --> 02:40:02,240
I forgot that they made Borderlands.

3227
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:03,240
Oh, well.

3228
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:06,480
Borderlands or a Duke Nukem forever is going to be fucking awesome then.

3229
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:07,480
Yeah.

3230
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:14,040
Cause they did the half-life blue shift and half-life, um, the one with the Marine, the,

3231
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:17,600
for the, the other expansion I'm blanking right now, I'm a huge half-life Stan.

3232
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:21,600
So anything that gearbox does, cause they're sort of a part of the valve family, I'm going

3233
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:25,240
to be all for.

3234
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,800
Whereas I don't think I've played a lot of their games.

3235
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:27,800
I'm not sure.

3236
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:28,800
All right, we're getting some calls.

3237
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,280
We're going to go to the Skype line and see what's up.

3238
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:31,440
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3239
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:32,440
Who's this?

3240
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:33,440
Hey, it's Ron.

3241
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:35,560
I just want to know, is it happy hour yet?

3242
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:36,560
Not yet.

3243
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:37,560
I'm still waiting for my drink.

3244
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:40,720
I'm supposed to get an hour and a half ago, but that's okay.

3245
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:41,720
It's all good.

3246
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:42,720
You're still waiting?

3247
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,720
I already started.

3248
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:44,720
Did you?

3249
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:45,720
What's the drink of choice for you right now, Rama?

3250
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:48,280
It says I have to grill tomorrow.

3251
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:50,760
I've been doing nothing but rum and Pepsi all night.

3252
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:52,080
So you have to grill tomorrow?

3253
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:53,080
What is that?

3254
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:54,080
I, I didn't know you were a chef.

3255
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:57,400
I thought you worked at like a retail store.

3256
02:40:57,400 --> 02:41:00,880
I haven't worked retail in about three, four months.

3257
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:02,200
You're at a restaurant now?

3258
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:04,280
No, I'm talking about tomorrow.

3259
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:05,840
I'm breaking out my grill.

3260
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:07,440
Oh, Labor Day barbecue.

3261
02:41:07,440 --> 02:41:08,440
I get it.

3262
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:09,440
Yes.

3263
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:10,440
I'm just, I'm just slow.

3264
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:11,440
Hi, Dan.

3265
02:41:11,440 --> 02:41:12,440
Oh, Dan just walked into studio.

3266
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:13,440
How you doing, Dan?

3267
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,440
Oh, Lord.

3268
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:15,440
I'm doing good.

3269
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:16,440
Good.

3270
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:17,560
Are you going to be joining us for more of the marathon later on this evening as we move

3271
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:19,160
on and take over your house for a night?

3272
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:21,560
I don't think I have much of a choice.

3273
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:22,560
Awesome.

3274
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:23,560
Sounds great.

3275
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:24,560
Yes.

3276
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:25,560
All right.

3277
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,360
So what types of games should we play a little bit during the marathon tonight?

3278
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:28,840
At some point, I think we're going to move into the vault.

3279
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:29,840
I don't know.

3280
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:30,840
We're out in the living room.

3281
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:31,840
I don't know what dark soccer has.

3282
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:33,120
I told Dan to hook up Saturn for me.

3283
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,120
All right.

3284
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:35,120
The Saturn's hooked up.

3285
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:36,120
Woo.

3286
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:37,360
It's in the vault.

3287
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:38,360
What are you going to play on the Saturn?

3288
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:39,360
Big TV.

3289
02:41:39,360 --> 02:41:40,360
All right.

3290
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:41,360
Anyhow.

3291
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:42,360
I'm playing Xbox on the big TV.

3292
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:43,360
All right.

3293
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:44,360
I got to get back to the call.

3294
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:45,360
We'll talk more of Dan later.

3295
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:46,360
Yes.

3296
02:41:46,360 --> 02:41:47,360
Stay back.

3297
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:48,360
All right.

3298
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:49,360
Yes.

3299
02:41:49,360 --> 02:41:50,360
Sounds good.

3300
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:54,360
Boy, last week's show was interesting.

3301
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:55,360
Anyhow.

3302
02:41:55,360 --> 02:41:57,280
So what, what's interesting?

3303
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:01,640
What's on your mind today, Rama, besides the whole happy hour?

3304
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:04,440
I'm actually a little bit pissed at some of the people today.

3305
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:08,960
I'm really pissed at people that are bitching about the $10 price increase on Xbox Live.

3306
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:11,760
Why are you mad at them?

3307
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:15,240
You're only paying $60 a year for this.

3308
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:18,320
I understand why the price is going up.

3309
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:22,520
Microsoft is actually putting the money into the infrastructure for improvements.

3310
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:26,080
In order to make those improvements, something has to go up.

3311
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:30,200
Unlike these other software companies who are trying to jack extra money out of us because

3312
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:34,920
of used games, they can kiss my ass for all I care, but that's besides the point.

3313
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:35,920
Yeah.

3314
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:41,000
I was going to say, you know, I'm, I, it feels like we're getting nickeled and dimed in every

3315
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,160
possible place here.

3316
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:46,300
And it's like, I'm okay with Microsoft raising the price because they haven't in so long

3317
02:42:46,300 --> 02:42:48,640
and they've been supporting it fairly decently.

3318
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:51,880
But then when I hear this online pass stuff is being allowed too, I get irritated.

3319
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:54,320
You know what I mean?

3320
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:55,320
Exactly.

3321
02:42:55,320 --> 02:43:01,280
And if people are complaining about it, like you said, buy the cards now or do what I do,

3322
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:02,860
join reward zone.

3323
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:04,080
They have a gamers club.

3324
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:06,360
You buy games, you get points.

3325
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:10,000
When you hit 150 bucks, you get a $10 gift card.

3326
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,160
Use that toward your, your, your live.

3327
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:14,640
You save 10 bucks that way.

3328
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:18,680
So try to find different ways to exploit reward systems and point cards and all that good

3329
02:43:18,680 --> 02:43:19,680
stuff, right?

3330
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:20,680
Yeah, exactly.

3331
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:23,520
Plus, Microsoft does do a buck a month deals.

3332
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,520
Those have popped up.

3333
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:25,520
Oh, that's true.

3334
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:26,520
Huh?

3335
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:27,520
I think I've seen those.

3336
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:28,520
Yeah.

3337
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:33,800
I saw it pop up on my dashboard on April fool's and I tweeted about everyone thought I was

3338
02:43:33,800 --> 02:43:34,800
lying about.

3339
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:36,200
I'm like, no, this is legit.

3340
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:38,000
Here's a screen cap.

3341
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,060
Interesting question from Derek H in our chat room.

3342
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:43,180
What are the odds that when reach comes out, there will be problems connecting because

3343
02:43:43,180 --> 02:43:45,680
Xbox live is overloaded.

3344
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:48,800
Then we'll see just how good their infrastructure is, right?

3345
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:53,480
I haven't seen it go down yet, you know, so I don't think there will be much of an issue.

3346
02:43:53,480 --> 02:43:55,360
I'm trying to think if it ever has gone down.

3347
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:58,400
Has Xbox live ever gone down in a non pre-planned way?

3348
02:43:58,400 --> 02:43:59,720
I'm sure it has for a little bit.

3349
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:00,720
Yeah.

3350
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:01,720
There was a few times.

3351
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:02,720
Never like anything too Epic.

3352
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:03,720
Right.

3353
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:04,960
It was always a weird times too.

3354
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:05,960
Wasn't it?

3355
02:44:05,960 --> 02:44:07,200
It was like around new years or something.

3356
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:10,080
I think this year it was having issues.

3357
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:11,440
I will be interested to see though.

3358
02:44:11,440 --> 02:44:17,160
I mean, he, Derek has a point if, if it goes down, then this whole fact that they're, you

3359
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:20,720
know, charging the extra money to improve their infrastructure is kind of a line, isn't

3360
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:21,720
it?

3361
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:22,720
Well, yeah.

3362
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:27,600
It's not because, um, you're really not going to be adding too many people to the actual

3363
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:28,600
live service.

3364
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:30,400
You're just going to have people playing a different game.

3365
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:33,280
And Derek says it happened with Halo three and Halo two.

3366
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:38,760
I don't remember it happening with Halo three, but then again, not to like sound beat sound

3367
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:42,600
like that guy, but I had it a couple of days early, so I was playing it a little bit earlier.

3368
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:47,240
So maybe I didn't notice it, but sometimes they try to do outages in advance to plan

3369
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:48,240
for this stuff.

3370
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:49,240
But yeah.

3371
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:52,920
And I do remember a couple of times Major Nelson said, there's been issues with live

3372
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:55,680
and within an hour or two, everything is back to normal.

3373
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,680
So, you know,

3374
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:01,960
Cause they know they're going to have to get hell, uh, with all these people paying for

3375
02:45:01,960 --> 02:45:07,680
it, which, you know, uh, whereas the PlayStation, uh, if you know, stuff goes down for them

3376
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:08,880
and it's free anyway.

3377
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:09,880
Right?

3378
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:10,880
Yeah.

3379
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:11,880
Yeah.

3380
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:15,360
Also there was, there was one time, a few times on like a, uh, one versus a hundred

3381
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:17,040
where they had problems with that.

3382
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,040
Oh really?

3383
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:19,040
Yeah.

3384
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:23,240
And it was kind of weird that was doing that because they had like a, like in their beta

3385
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:27,080
seasons had like 150,000 at one time and it was working fine probably back then.

3386
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:30,760
But it was like 50,000 that it was coming in for a time and it didn't work for like

3387
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:31,760
two weeks.

3388
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:32,760
Interesting.

3389
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:33,760
I don't remember that.

3390
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:35,860
But then again, I was kind of one of those people that played it more when it first came

3391
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:39,080
out and then like later on I was like, oh, it'll always be here.

3392
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:40,080
I'll just play it next time.

3393
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:41,560
And then, oh, now it's gone.

3394
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:42,560
No more of that.

3395
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:43,560
Yeah.

3396
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:44,560
Forget that.

3397
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:48,640
That's one thing I would hope with this extra $10 is they'd add something that's like that

3398
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:49,880
to replace it.

3399
02:45:49,880 --> 02:45:54,320
That is a damn good point is that, you know, they took away one versus a hundred and you

3400
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:57,240
know, they're going to be charging more for Xbox live.

3401
02:45:57,240 --> 02:46:00,680
Like if they brought something awesome like that back, like more of these interactive

3402
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:03,520
live shows, I charged me 20 more.

3403
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:06,120
Well, you know what I think would be a benefit.

3404
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:07,120
Huh?

3405
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:11,560
I'm going to take that thing and shove it up your butt.

3406
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:15,000
Come on.

3407
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,360
I figured we had to have at least once during the marathon.

3408
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:19,360
You know what?

3409
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:20,560
Oh, what?

3410
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:25,600
I've decided that I am so sick of dark Sakura always having her stupid vuvuzilla button

3411
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:30,680
here on the program that what I've decided to do is that I've actually, um, decided to

3412
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:40,720
counter dark Sakura a little bit here and uh, I actually have my stadium vuvuzilla noise.

3413
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:41,720
You are such a dork.

3414
02:46:41,720 --> 02:46:45,520
So we can have dueling vuvuzillas on the show.

3415
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:46,520
That's going to be amazing.

3416
02:46:46,520 --> 02:46:47,520
We'll duet Rob.

3417
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:48,520
Great.

3418
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:49,520
I'm sure the listeners are so excited.

3419
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:53,520
Well, I am glad they do look for it.

3420
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:56,520
It's a band, that thing.

3421
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:58,520
Turn off.

3422
02:46:58,520 --> 02:47:00,520
There we go.

3423
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:01,520
All right.

3424
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:02,520
It won't shut up.

3425
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:03,520
All right.

3426
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:04,520
Rama, anything else you want to share with us for now?

3427
02:47:04,520 --> 02:47:08,000
I'm sure you'll call in later, but you know, well, if you want, I have another story.

3428
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:11,480
I can say that when I called back later, actually, we're supposed to be doing an outbound call

3429
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:12,480
right now.

3430
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:15,840
So, um, I'm going to let you go for now, but call in later and give us that story because

3431
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:19,480
we do still have more stories too that we're going to talk about a little later.

3432
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:20,480
Wonderful.

3433
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,480
Great.

3434
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,480
All right.

3435
02:47:22,480 --> 02:47:23,480
Talk to you later.

3436
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:24,480
Be more drunk.

3437
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:25,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3438
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:26,480
Bye bye.

3439
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:27,480
Bye.

3440
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:28,480
All right.

3441
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:29,480
We're going to hold off on calls for a minute because we're actually going to make an outbound

3442
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:30,480
call.

3443
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:36,200
It is now five o'clock Pacific and yeah, we're three hours in and usually at this time there's

3444
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:40,400
another man live at All Games Radio and some people might be tuning in to try and hear

3445
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:42,200
him, but you can't.

3446
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:43,200
He's not live tonight.

3447
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:49,080
The man is Bobby Black Wolf, the host of the Bobby Black Wolf show here on All Games Radio

3448
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:53,280
and he's not live tonight cause he's at Dragon Con this weekend.

3449
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:57,480
So sorry fans of Bobby who don't listen to us.

3450
02:47:57,480 --> 02:48:00,720
Uh, you don't get Bobby tonight or do you?

3451
02:48:00,720 --> 02:48:04,160
We're going to call him right now actually and try to get him on the show so he can have

3452
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:06,120
a mini Bobby Black Wolf show.

3453
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:11,120
So two ringy dingys.

3454
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:14,840
Hey Bobby, how are you doing?

3455
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:16,800
It's your buddy Rob from Orange Launch Radio.

3456
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:18,400
Hey, I'm doing great.

3457
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,720
How are, how are you guys holding up?

3458
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:21,720
That's what?

3459
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:22,720
Hour three?

3460
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:23,720
Good.

3461
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:24,720
Yes.

3462
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:25,720
We're in hour three.

3463
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:28,560
We got started a little bit late cause weird server problems at All Games and I know Scott's

3464
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:31,880
at Burning Man and all these other things are going on, but it just magically started

3465
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:33,120
working at two.

3466
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:36,760
So I'm not sure if somebody must have put it on a schedule or something and we tried

3467
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:37,760
to take it.

3468
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:39,320
It's on a schedule.

3469
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:40,640
It may cut you off later.

3470
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:41,640
I don't know.

3471
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:42,640
Oh, great.

3472
02:48:42,640 --> 02:48:43,640
Just what we needed.

3473
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:44,640
Yeah.

3474
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:46,720
Who knows how long the marathon will be going tonight.

3475
02:48:46,720 --> 02:48:50,400
It'll when All Games Radio decides to cut it off, we'll be done I guess.

3476
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:51,400
We'll see what happens.

3477
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:52,400
All right.

3478
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:53,400
Right.

3479
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:54,400
Try to tweet channel Z.

3480
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:55,400
All right.

3481
02:48:55,400 --> 02:48:56,400
We'll see.

3482
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:57,400
All right.

3483
02:48:57,400 --> 02:49:00,640
Well, I figured, you know, since you're not able to do a show here live at All Games Radio

3484
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:05,080
cause A you're gone and B we took over, I thought maybe you'd want to do the mini Bobby

3485
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:06,080
Black Wolf show.

3486
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:07,080
Sure.

3487
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:10,840
I mean, I, well then I can talk about what's been going on here at Dragon Con and some

3488
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:14,600
of the neat stuff that I've done and something that we're actually going to be running next

3489
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:18,880
week, which I didn't even know.

3490
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:19,880
Hold on.

3491
02:49:19,880 --> 02:49:20,880
This is very important.

3492
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:21,880
Breaking news here at the OLR marathon.

3493
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:23,600
I believe I've been given a glass of liquor.

3494
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,600
What is this?

3495
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:25,600
This is my first booze of the evening.

3496
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:26,600
What is this?

3497
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:30,760
It's a double shot of tequila and, uh, um, it better be Patron.

3498
02:49:30,760 --> 02:49:31,760
It is.

3499
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:32,760
Okay.

3500
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:33,760
Okay.

3501
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:34,760
Okay.

3502
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:35,760
Good.

3503
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:36,760
Good.

3504
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:40,600
And it's a pea grapefruit juice.

3505
02:49:40,600 --> 02:49:41,600
That's a tasty beverage.

3506
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:42,600
All right.

3507
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:43,600
I'm making more.

3508
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,600
Who wants one?

3509
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:45,600
Sorry, Bobby.

3510
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:46,600
I just, um,

3511
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:47,600
Oh, there's beverages here.

3512
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:48,600
Don't worry.

3513
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:49,600
I don't feel left out.

3514
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:50,600
Yeah.

3515
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:53,800
I was going to say you, you sound like you're either kind of tired or maybe, maybe you've

3516
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:55,320
had a beverage or two yourself.

3517
02:49:55,320 --> 02:49:56,320
I don't know.

3518
02:49:56,320 --> 02:49:57,320
Have you, have you?

3519
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:58,800
I actually haven't had a beverage today.

3520
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:04,280
I found a quiet place kind of to be, and then I realized the quiet place is right next to

3521
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:06,880
security operations for the hotel.

3522
02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:09,160
So I'm kind of trying to keep it down a little bit.

3523
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:10,160
Ah, I see.

3524
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:11,160
Okay.

3525
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:12,160
All right.

3526
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:13,160
Well, what's Dragon, what's going on at Dragon Con?

3527
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:15,560
I know you want to tell us a little bit about what's going on over there at the show and

3528
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:18,040
some of the stuff you got for your own show next week.

3529
02:50:18,040 --> 02:50:23,400
Well, basically, I mean, Dragon Con, it's, it's a big, it's, you know, it's, take Comic

3530
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:26,200
Con and take out really a lot of like the industry stuff.

3531
02:50:26,200 --> 02:50:28,200
This is a fan convention.

3532
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,120
There are a lot of celebrities here.

3533
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:33,480
Um, I haven't stood in line for any of those panels or anything.

3534
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:37,040
I've actually been here trying, you know, staying away from video games, staying away

3535
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:38,360
from computers.

3536
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:42,560
The game I actually been playing most recently, I don't know if you've ever played this game.

3537
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:46,560
It's a, it's a card slash role playing game called are you a werewolf?

3538
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:47,840
Have you ever played that?

3539
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:49,560
No, but it sounds interesting.

3540
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:53,040
Loki, are you a werewolf?

3541
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:54,040
It goes by another name.

3542
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:55,040
Some people know it as mafia.

3543
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:56,040
It's the same rules.

3544
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:59,120
Oh God, we, I have played a game like this.

3545
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:02,160
It's um, no, when I played it, it was just called werewolf.

3546
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:03,840
It's a very popular foreign game, right?

3547
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:07,120
It's the thing where, um, like you have a group of 12 people, right?

3548
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:12,160
And like three of them are wolves and like every night the, everybody votes to lynch

3549
02:51:12,160 --> 02:51:13,700
one person.

3550
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:16,200
And if the wolves are the last people standing, they win.

3551
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:18,200
But if the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they win.

3552
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:19,200
Yes.

3553
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:23,920
I've, I've, I've said this game play before, that's from 2am to 9am.

3554
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:24,920
Okay.

3555
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:28,800
And then I, and then I sleep a little bit and about one o'clock I get up and go to the

3556
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:30,680
dealer's room and stuff like that.

3557
02:51:30,680 --> 02:51:33,720
Uh, so that's really what I've been doing is staying away from video games.

3558
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,680
There is a video game room here.

3559
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:41,120
They do have consoles here that people can check out games, use games from the game store

3560
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:42,480
that's running it from Tennessee.

3561
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:46,320
Um, but really it's not really the focus of DragonCon.

3562
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:52,240
There are no game companies exhibiting here, so it's, there's not that much video game

3563
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:54,560
type stuff going on here.

3564
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:57,240
However, and this is the cool thing.

3565
02:51:57,240 --> 02:52:00,160
I just got an interview, which we're going to run on my show next week, which by the

3566
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:01,920
way guys is 25 minutes long.

3567
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:02,920
Woohoo.

3568
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:07,960
Do you remember, did you ever remember in Dave and Buster, the BattleTech centers?

3569
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:08,960
Absolutely.

3570
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:14,160
Dan absolutely loved that thing and he was pissed when it was taken out.

3571
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:19,520
I have the entire story on why it was taken out and where all those pods went because

3572
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:25,560
there are eight BattleTech pods downstairs, 24 hours right here at DragonCon.

3573
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:26,840
Oh wow.

3574
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:27,840
That's awesome.

3575
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:29,640
And they are still making updates.

3576
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:33,040
The game actually looks a lot like MechWarrior 4 on the PC now.

3577
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:35,920
They're actually, the software company is still working on new updates.

3578
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:39,520
They're going to bring back Red Planet very soon as well.

3579
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:44,720
You know, um, and uh, I got the story of, you know, where they travel and uh, you know,

3580
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:49,440
because basically Enthusiast bought all the pods after Dave and Busters canceled the contract.

3581
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:53,960
And the short story is Dave and Busters decided that they no longer wanted to have anybody

3582
02:52:53,960 --> 02:52:55,280
working the Midway.

3583
02:52:55,280 --> 02:52:57,040
Everything had to be self-sustaining.

3584
02:52:57,040 --> 02:53:01,360
And so the BattleTech, they decided did not renew the contract with Virtual World.

3585
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:05,520
So they were going to sell all the pods and all these Enthusiasts came together and said,

3586
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,720
we'll buy this set and this set.

3587
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:11,240
And now all the sets are all over the country and some of them are mobile now.

3588
02:53:11,240 --> 02:53:12,240
Wow.

3589
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:13,240
Huh.

3590
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:20,200
And I, so I have a 25 minute interview with an owner of one of a set of 16 pods, eight

3591
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:23,320
of which are traveling, eight of which are in a center in Houston.

3592
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:28,160
Uh, and we talk about, you know, what, because he was just a player and they got the funds

3593
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:29,160
together to buy it.

3594
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:34,000
And they traveled the country with these pods and they do maintenance on the hardware and

3595
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,520
they do the community thing and do the whole BattleTech Center stuff.

3596
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:40,200
But they're keeping the BattleTech dream alive.

3597
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:44,080
And we're going to have a long, nice, very good interview with him next week on the Bobby

3598
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:45,080
Block World Show.

3599
02:53:45,080 --> 02:53:46,940
I'm excited to hear it.

3600
02:53:46,940 --> 02:53:51,320
When I was living in Walnut Creek, we had a Virtual World, one of the few that were

3601
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:55,800
in California and I used to play a BattleTech in those pods.

3602
02:53:55,800 --> 02:53:57,560
It's a great time.

3603
02:53:57,560 --> 02:53:58,780
That made me super motion sick.

3604
02:53:58,780 --> 02:54:02,280
The one time I tried, I remember playing the Dave and Buster's, I got my butt kicked by

3605
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:03,280
Dan, but it was fun.

3606
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:05,440
I played that that time too.

3607
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:08,520
We were there for one of my birthdays and I was super drunk, but I was really motion

3608
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:09,680
sick anyway.

3609
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:13,600
But that new Dave and Buster's in Roseville, like if they try to put a BattleTech center

3610
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,640
there, that would just be the entire place.

3611
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:16,640
It would.

3612
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:17,640
It's that small.

3613
02:54:17,640 --> 02:54:18,640
It's Dave and Buster's Jr.

3614
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:20,680
Well, that's going to be an awesome interview, Bobby.

3615
02:54:20,680 --> 02:54:22,440
We're looking forward to that next week.

3616
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:24,120
What else is going on at Dragon Con?

3617
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:26,560
Did you end up on a panel after all, I heard?

3618
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:27,560
What's this?

3619
02:54:27,560 --> 02:54:28,560
I did.

3620
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:33,400
The panel they had put me on was the kickoff panel, which was Friday at one o'clock and

3621
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:36,720
I actually had to work until noon.

3622
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:40,920
I was all packed and everything and I had left at noon to get down here and the trains

3623
02:54:40,920 --> 02:54:44,200
were held up a little bit.

3624
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:49,520
I actually walked into the back of the panel at 1.15 and the place is packed.

3625
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:52,640
They do call me up at about 1.15, 1.20.

3626
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:57,080
I haven't even gotten my badge yet because the badge line is five hours long for pre-registration.

3627
02:54:57,080 --> 02:55:02,120
That's the one thing Dragon Con hasn't figured out is how to pick up your badge.

3628
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:06,240
I went up, did the panel, did the last 30 minutes of the panel.

3629
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:07,240
The room was packed.

3630
02:55:07,240 --> 02:55:09,440
Would you like to know why the room was packed, Rob?

3631
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:10,440
Why?

3632
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:11,440
It wasn't for me.

3633
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:16,560
This is the key, if you ever want to have a packed panel, have Veronica Belmont on it

3634
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:18,560
with you.

3635
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:19,680
Nice.

3636
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:20,680
She was there, huh?

3637
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:25,160
No, because she was there with the Swords and Lasers podcast is kind of the one.

3638
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:26,400
That's her independent podcast.

3639
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:27,400
They're here.

3640
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:33,640
They actually did a live show in a large ballroom today at four here, but she was on the panel

3641
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:34,640
and stuff.

3642
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:40,800
I talked a little bit about what we do at all games and stuff like that, but yeah, the

3643
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:42,800
place was packed and it's because Veronica was there.

3644
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:46,400
When it was over, everybody was rushing to get their pictures with Veronica and all that

3645
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:47,400
stuff.

3646
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:49,880
I did get to speak on one panel, but that was it.

3647
02:55:49,880 --> 02:55:53,880
My official obligations were gone in two and I didn't even have my badge yet at the time.

3648
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:57,800
One of the few podcasts that I will admit to listening to, because it is pretty good,

3649
02:55:57,800 --> 02:56:01,320
is The Instance, which is one of the World of Warcraft podcasts that's out there.

3650
02:56:01,320 --> 02:56:07,440
She was actually on, they recently had a big buku ye hippie hurrah 200th episode, and she

3651
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:09,000
was on that.

3652
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:12,360
I was kind of like, oh yeah, this is kind of interesting.

3653
02:56:12,360 --> 02:56:13,360
Yeah.

3654
02:56:13,360 --> 02:56:14,360
Well, cool.

3655
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:16,320
She does a lot of independent stuff.

3656
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:21,160
I mean, yeah, she's been hired by CNET, she works for CORE, but she still really loves

3657
02:56:21,160 --> 02:56:23,920
doing all the independent stuff.

3658
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:24,920
She considers it a hobby.

3659
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:25,920
That's awesome.

3660
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:28,840
It's a good way to do it, good for her.

3661
02:56:28,840 --> 02:56:33,840
What about, are there any other type of record-breaking things going on there, like no thriller dances

3662
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:35,760
this year, or what's going on?

3663
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:40,960
Well, they can't do Thriller because the Thriller record is currently 12,000.

3664
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:44,800
Mexico City set it to 12,000, so the 900, whatever they did here.

3665
02:56:44,800 --> 02:56:48,360
I don't know how they did, I mean, obviously, we won't know how they did until Guinness

3666
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:55,400
verifies it, but they did two existing records, and they tried to set up a brand new record.

3667
02:56:55,400 --> 02:56:59,480
The two existing, they wanted the most Star Trek characters in one place, and the most

3668
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:04,240
superheroes in one place, and then they created a new one of most theme punk characters in

3669
02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:07,640
one place, because theme punk's really kind of the new goth.

3670
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:14,240
Here at DragonCon, everybody is theme punk, and ears, and all that stuff, so it used to

3671
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:17,280
be just Neil Victoria, and then they added all the technology to it.

3672
02:57:17,280 --> 02:57:20,680
So those are the records that they've been trying to break.

3673
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:24,120
But I don't know exactly how those have been going.

3674
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:25,120
Sounds like fun, though.

3675
02:57:25,120 --> 02:57:26,120
Good times.

3676
02:57:26,120 --> 02:57:31,800
Now, I will say, I did go in the dealer's room, there is a dealer that actually had

3677
02:57:31,800 --> 02:57:37,920
a lot of, going back to the video game thing, a lot of rare Nintendo games, Super Nintendo

3678
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:40,720
games, things like that.

3679
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:44,200
He actually had Earthbound for the NES.

3680
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:45,200
Oh wow.

3681
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:46,200
The cartridge.

3682
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:47,200
Oh wow.

3683
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:48,200
That's...

3684
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:52,760
He was selling it for $130, and I did not get it in time.

3685
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:55,840
I came back ready to get it, and somebody else had bought it.

3686
02:57:55,840 --> 02:57:58,280
Oh, that's awful.

3687
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:03,600
But it was the actual limited edition NES release of Earthbound.

3688
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:10,480
He's got little Samsung, he's got an NES port test cartridge, so one of the test cartridges

3689
02:58:10,480 --> 02:58:14,800
that the service centers had, and he's got that for $350, which is a lot more than it

3690
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:17,680
ever goes on eBay, but it's very, very rare.

3691
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:28,320
But I did buy something from him, Nintendo related, and it's not exactly rare, and once

3692
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:33,320
people see exactly what it is, it's not gonna sound as cool as it would when you first see

3693
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:35,920
it, but I'm gonna save that for Friday night on Friday Night Gaming.

3694
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:38,160
Oh, a little tease there, all right.

3695
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:43,800
So Friday Night Gaming, if you wanna check that out this Friday at fnglive.net, right?

3696
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:47,360
Yes, and the main game we'll be playing is Metroid Other M.

3697
02:58:47,360 --> 02:58:48,360
Because it's effing live.

3698
02:58:48,360 --> 02:58:52,360
But I'll be showing this game that I picked up here at DragonCon for a pretty penny, and

3699
02:58:52,360 --> 02:58:55,480
I overpaid a little bit, as you can expect, for con prices and stuff.

3700
02:58:55,480 --> 02:58:59,000
I looked online how much it is, and I could have gotten it online for a lot cheaper.

3701
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:02,200
I'll tell you where you can get it once we show it.

3702
02:59:02,200 --> 02:59:11,480
But yeah, he had all the Mega Man, he had, I can't remember what Super Nintendo games,

3703
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:14,720
but he had Little Samson, I guess, is a really rare NES game.

3704
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:17,920
You get that in the box, sitting in there.

3705
02:59:17,920 --> 02:59:23,000
So there's some rare stuff that I found in the dealer's room, and I just can't afford

3706
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,000
it all.

3707
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,360
We're actually looking at our chat room at chat.orangelandradiocom.

3708
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:27,680
I apologize to Bobby's fans.

3709
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:31,280
I kinda have one eye on the all games chat room, but I'm not able to follow.

3710
02:59:31,280 --> 02:59:34,320
There's a lot of chatty chat going on there right now, but let's see.

3711
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:37,960
Breakman says, Earthbound for the NES and Bobby let him keep his life?

3712
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:39,960
He got lucky.

3713
02:59:39,960 --> 02:59:45,080
Well, I bought this other thing first.

3714
02:59:45,080 --> 02:59:49,440
It was my first priority, and then I came back and it was gone by the time I had come

3715
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:51,440
back the next day.

3716
02:59:51,440 --> 02:59:54,000
That's too bad.

3717
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,920
You'll have to find the guy who bought it and end his life.

3718
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:58,920
No.

3719
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:04,480
All right, so if you're the guy that bought the Earthbound on the NES cartridge at Dragon

3720
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:06,120
Con, Bobby's looking for you.

3721
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:07,120
All right.

3722
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:08,120
That's right.

3723
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:09,120
I want Earthbound Zero sometime.

3724
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:10,120
All right.

3725
03:00:10,120 --> 03:00:13,620
Well, Bobby, we don't want to keep you up for the convention too much longer, but anything

3726
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:19,440
else you want to say about the convention or your show or anything for the folks listening?

3727
03:00:19,440 --> 03:00:20,440
Not really.

3728
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:22,360
I mean, Dragon Con, it's been a fun time.

3729
03:00:22,360 --> 03:00:23,560
There's a lot of great costumes.

3730
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:26,400
I have not seen Brad from pot culture yet.

3731
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:27,400
I know he's here.

3732
03:00:27,400 --> 03:00:31,120
He's out having dinner somewhere tonight, so I didn't get to...

3733
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:37,240
I haven't been able to say hi to him, but I mean, no, and here's the great thing, Rob.

3734
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:38,840
They moved PAX next year.

3735
03:00:38,840 --> 03:00:39,840
Did you notice that?

3736
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:40,840
No.

3737
03:00:40,840 --> 03:00:42,760
PAX got moved.

3738
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:44,760
I did not.

3739
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:46,480
It's back to its original weekend.

3740
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:49,280
It is the last weekend of August next year.

3741
03:00:49,280 --> 03:00:51,160
It is not Labor Day weekend.

3742
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:52,160
It's the weekend before.

3743
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:53,160
Interesting.

3744
03:00:53,160 --> 03:00:54,160
Flights are cheaper.

3745
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,160
That'll be good.

3746
03:00:55,160 --> 03:00:56,160
Yeah.

3747
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:57,160
Flights will be cheaper.

3748
03:00:57,160 --> 03:00:58,160
It's been a long time.

3749
03:00:58,160 --> 03:00:59,160
I have to do that next year then.

3750
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:03,200
So I'll be able to make it out there and here, and I don't have to worry about which one

3751
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:06,880
I'm going to, so I was very happy about that.

3752
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:09,480
I've been trying to keep an eye on PAX news and stuff.

3753
03:01:09,480 --> 03:01:12,840
I'll believe the Duke Nukem for everything when I see it.

3754
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:13,840
It's...

3755
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:15,080
They've got video from the show floor.

3756
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:16,080
It's nuts.

3757
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:17,080
I'm just...

3758
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:22,500
Then they can say, oh, by the way, yeah, it won't be coming out for another 10 years.

3759
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:26,320
But it's the guys who did Borderlands now, and as we were kind of discussing earlier

3760
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:29,840
when it was our lead story tonight, as you can probably imagine, we were kind of talking

3761
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:34,040
about how it's probably not really the same game 3D Realms was developing.

3762
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:40,120
It was just kind of like, okay, well, we've bought this IP from the slaughter of 3D Realms.

3763
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:43,700
Let's just take all these art assets and the idea and see what we can do with it, and now

3764
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:46,880
you actually have a game, because it's not the same game.

3765
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:47,880
Yeah.

3766
03:01:47,880 --> 03:01:48,880
Let's see.

3767
03:01:48,880 --> 03:01:49,880
Go ahead.

3768
03:01:49,880 --> 03:01:55,000
One last thing is I wanted to do my show this week mainly because I wish I was doing it

3769
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:58,400
because Microsoft has been showing a hell of a lot of balls this week.

3770
03:01:58,400 --> 03:01:59,400
How so?

3771
03:01:59,400 --> 03:02:02,960
With the new controller and the Xbox Live.

3772
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:03,960
We have talked about...

3773
03:02:03,960 --> 03:02:04,960
What was that?

3774
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:05,960
Yeah.

3775
03:02:05,960 --> 03:02:06,960
So we have talked about some of that stuff.

3776
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:07,960
Yeah.

3777
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:11,360
The limited edition controller or the bundled or whatever controller and the price increases

3778
03:02:11,360 --> 03:02:14,080
we were just talking about before we had you on.

3779
03:02:14,080 --> 03:02:15,080
Yeah.

3780
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:16,080
Yeah.

3781
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:19,680
Microsoft is just showing a lot of balls this week, and I'm like, damn, they had to do this

3782
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:20,680
on the week.

3783
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:21,680
I'm not doing anything.

3784
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:24,720
Let me get some quick questions from our chat room at chat.org.com.

3785
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:28,600
G Ripper wants to know, is Glenn there, your partner in crime from FNG Live?

3786
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:29,600
No.

3787
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:31,280
He is not here.

3788
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:33,920
Nobody else from FNG was able to make it up here.

3789
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:38,580
Derek H asks, is it true that as Chris Gore said, Dragon Con is a sluttier version of

3790
03:02:38,580 --> 03:02:39,580
Comic-Con?

3791
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:40,580
Probably.

3792
03:02:40,580 --> 03:02:41,580
Yeah.

3793
03:02:41,580 --> 03:02:42,580
Yeah.

3794
03:02:42,580 --> 03:02:47,720
Have you seen a lot of hot sluts?

3795
03:02:47,720 --> 03:02:49,240
I will make you really answer that.

3796
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:50,240
Oh, yeah.

3797
03:02:50,240 --> 03:02:51,240
Oh, yeah.

3798
03:02:51,240 --> 03:02:52,240
Here's the thing.

3799
03:02:52,240 --> 03:02:53,240
Here's the thing, Rob.

3800
03:02:53,240 --> 03:02:54,840
Here's the thing.

3801
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:55,840
What?

3802
03:02:55,840 --> 03:03:00,840
The saying goes, if you don't get laid at Dragon Con, you're not trying.

3803
03:03:00,840 --> 03:03:05,800
Yeah, I've heard that those furries can get pretty aggressive.

3804
03:03:05,800 --> 03:03:06,800
It's like the Ren Faire.

3805
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:10,800
Just walk into one of those little gift party rooms and you'll have a good time.

3806
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:13,640
Thankfully, I have not seen a single one of them.

3807
03:03:13,640 --> 03:03:14,640
You haven't seen a furry?

3808
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:17,040
Well, because they're all too busy at the orgy.

3809
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:18,040
That's why they're...

3810
03:03:18,040 --> 03:03:19,040
Yes.

3811
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:22,880
If you haven't seen a furry, you're not trying hard enough.

3812
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:27,440
And they don't need a Craigslist posting to get that going.

3813
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:28,440
They can't now.

3814
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:33,920
Craigslist has censored the adult services section now on Craigslist, apparently.

3815
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:34,920
So there you go.

3816
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:36,320
But Pac needed a Craigslist post to do it.

3817
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:37,320
You don't need that here.

3818
03:03:37,320 --> 03:03:38,320
It just happens.

3819
03:03:38,320 --> 03:03:39,320
All right.

3820
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:41,520
Bobby, we're going to let you go.

3821
03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:42,840
Have fun at Dragon Con.

3822
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:46,240
Have a blast, especially for us since we're not there, since it seems like everybody else

3823
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:48,420
is going to some convention but us.

3824
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:51,120
And we'll have a drink in your honor a little later, all right?

3825
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:52,120
Excellent.

3826
03:03:52,120 --> 03:03:54,240
I'll have a drink in your honor over here, too.

3827
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:55,240
Sounds good.

3828
03:03:55,240 --> 03:03:56,240
All right.

3829
03:03:56,240 --> 03:03:57,240
Have a good one, Bobby.

3830
03:03:57,240 --> 03:03:58,240
See you.

3831
03:03:58,240 --> 03:03:59,240
All right.

3832
03:03:59,240 --> 03:04:02,600
Bobby Blackwolf, the man who is usually live right now at All Games Radio, but it's a special

3833
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:03,600
weekend.

3834
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:04,680
It's Labor Day weekend.

3835
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:05,680
We're doing a marathon.

3836
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:07,320
He's at Dragon Con.

3837
03:04:07,320 --> 03:04:09,080
Scott's at Burning Man.

3838
03:04:09,080 --> 03:04:13,280
Most people are at Pac's, but we're right here in the OLR Studios, and boy, aren't we

3839
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:14,760
having fun together.

3840
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:18,600
Actually, there's quite a few of you listening tonight, so I really appreciate that.

3841
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:20,720
It looks like you guys are with us here.

3842
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:23,240
So we're going to keep going and take some more calls.

3843
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:26,520
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradial.

3844
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:30,040
We'll get in at least a couple more calls before the next break and before we say goodbye

3845
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:33,440
to Loki for the night, and then we'll... I don't know what we'll do.

3846
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:36,800
I'm thinking maybe for the next segment, Dark Sakura, I told you we should think of this.

3847
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:41,680
Maybe we'll go into the vault and just pull some random games and talk about them.

3848
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:42,680
Okay.

3849
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:44,720
Like maybe like gaming memories or whatever.

3850
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:45,720
Okay.

3851
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:47,960
But we also... We need to take the chat room into the vault somehow.

3852
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:49,520
Do we have a laptop or anything?

3853
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,320
I got... Why am I not in the car?

3854
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:52,320
Yeah.

3855
03:04:52,320 --> 03:04:53,320
I can do that.

3856
03:04:53,320 --> 03:04:54,320
Okay.

3857
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:55,320
Do you know that you have the password to your Wi-Fi so we can...

3858
03:04:55,320 --> 03:04:56,320
Yes.

3859
03:04:56,320 --> 03:04:57,320
Okay.

3860
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,320
Good.

3861
03:04:58,320 --> 03:04:59,320
Good deal.

3862
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:00,320
We'll do that.

3863
03:05:00,320 --> 03:05:01,320
And then you get to hear what it is.

3864
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:03,560
Do they have like an app or something on the iPhone that you can do like a Justin TV or

3865
03:05:03,560 --> 03:05:04,560
something?

3866
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:06,720
There is... Yes.

3867
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:09,120
I have a Ustream.

3868
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:12,400
We've actually had for several years, and I guess now's the time to say it.

3869
03:05:12,400 --> 03:05:14,200
We've had a secret Ustream channel.

3870
03:05:14,200 --> 03:05:15,200
It's not that secret.

3871
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:21,080
It's just that before we went to Justin TV, literally the week before, I reserved a Ustream

3872
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:22,080
for us.

3873
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:26,160
But we opted to go with Justin TV because that's where the All Games Network went.

3874
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:30,280
And it seemed like most of the folks in the shows that we're related to and so forth all

3875
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:31,760
went towards Justin TV.

3876
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:37,040
So we went there for the whole Synergy thing because it was kind of the same thing.

3877
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:42,120
Now that that isn't really the case anymore, there's... Some of our fans still broadcast

3878
03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:45,240
on Justin TV, and I think that's really cool.

3879
03:05:45,240 --> 03:05:48,040
But I did get a Ustream application for the phone.

3880
03:05:48,040 --> 03:05:52,840
I actually did a test run the other night just to see how well it worked.

3881
03:05:52,840 --> 03:05:58,200
The video quality's kind of poop, but it does let you stream over 3G.

3882
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:00,360
So it's kind of neat in that regard.

3883
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:01,360
So I don't know.

3884
03:06:01,360 --> 03:06:02,360
Maybe we'll broadcast.

3885
03:06:02,360 --> 03:06:06,960
But I just... I think the video quality is such poop, and we're a radio show.

3886
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:08,520
I don't know if it's really worth it, to be honest.

3887
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:12,320
If you associate your iPhone with the Wi-Fi here, would the app then associate with the

3888
03:06:12,320 --> 03:06:13,320
Wi-Fi?

3889
03:06:13,320 --> 03:06:15,520
It would, but my concern is that it's going to have this-

3890
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:16,520
Oh, it's going to choke the stream.

3891
03:06:16,520 --> 03:06:21,880
It's going to choke the stream, which we were having those problems earlier when the feed

3892
03:06:21,880 --> 03:06:23,360
was unknowingly broadcasting.

3893
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:24,360
So yeah.

3894
03:06:24,360 --> 03:06:27,320
Yeah, we've had a Orange Launch Radio Ustream for like three years.

3895
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:28,320
We just don't use it.

3896
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:29,320
There you go.

3897
03:06:29,320 --> 03:06:30,680
And I actually kind of agree with Derek.

3898
03:06:30,680 --> 03:06:31,680
Justin kind of sucks now.

3899
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:34,560
Like the whole... It's just not quite what it used to be.

3900
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:38,080
You know, a Ustream has sort of established itself as the definitive place to go for

3901
03:06:38,080 --> 03:06:40,320
streaming and... I don't know.

3902
03:06:40,320 --> 03:06:43,280
I don't know if... I really would have to explore.

3903
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:46,640
We haven't had videos so long now, ever since we switched studios, that I'd really have

3904
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:47,640
to explore that.

3905
03:06:47,640 --> 03:06:48,640
So we'll see.

3906
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:49,640
All right.

3907
03:06:49,640 --> 03:06:52,400
Anyhow, I didn't mean to get off topic.

3908
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:54,120
I was waiting for calls, but none are coming in.

3909
03:06:54,120 --> 03:06:56,120
What is... How are we going to do a marathon with no calls?

3910
03:06:56,120 --> 03:06:57,120
We're screwed.

3911
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:58,120
Dammit, people.

3912
03:06:58,120 --> 03:06:59,120
Call.

3913
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:01,440
We'll try to get at least one more call in before we say goodbye to Loki.

3914
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:05,960
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us

3915
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:07,040
a call.

3916
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:09,680
We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call, but if you don't get in now, that's

3917
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,680
okay.

3918
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:13,800
We'll open it up again around the usual time, about eight o'clock later this evening, and

3919
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:16,920
so forth, during the OLR marathon.

3920
03:07:16,920 --> 03:07:20,200
We also have some more stories we're going to do.

3921
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:24,720
If I have time to write them while other people are talking, and I'm not so intoxicated after

3922
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:28,040
that drink, we will do some OLR games.

3923
03:07:28,040 --> 03:07:29,200
We need a listless topic.

3924
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:30,200
We can think of that later.

3925
03:07:30,200 --> 03:07:31,200
Totally.

3926
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:32,200
And we should do match game?

3927
03:07:32,200 --> 03:07:33,200
We'll do match game.

3928
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:35,760
We have at least four people here, and with Dan we'll have five, so we can do a match

3929
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:36,760
game.

3930
03:07:36,760 --> 03:07:39,680
We could also do Mad Libs.

3931
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:42,680
You never did do OLR Mad Libs.

3932
03:07:42,680 --> 03:07:46,120
The phone is ringing and my back is turned, I can't even see it, shame on me.

3933
03:07:46,120 --> 03:07:47,120
Let's go to the phones.

3934
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:48,120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3935
03:07:48,120 --> 03:07:49,120
Who's this?

3936
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:50,120
This is Haseo.

3937
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:51,120
Taseo?

3938
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:52,120
Haseo Sumerakawa.

3939
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:53,120
Oh, Haseo.

3940
03:07:53,120 --> 03:07:54,120
Okay, hi, how you doing?

3941
03:07:54,120 --> 03:07:55,120
I'm doing good.

3942
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:56,120
Good.

3943
03:07:56,120 --> 03:07:57,120
What is on your mind, my friend?

3944
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:09,520
I just want to say that role-playing quests are a bitch.

3945
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:10,640
Role-playing quests are a bitch?

3946
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:13,060
What game are you playing right now?

3947
03:08:13,060 --> 03:08:17,880
I am playing a free-to-play MMO called Nabinogi.

3948
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:20,920
I have never heard of this, so you've got to tell us a little more about this.

3949
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:23,840
Is there a website you can download this at or anything like that?

3950
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:28,360
Yeah, the Nexon.nabinogi.com.

3951
03:08:28,360 --> 03:08:33,080
They also do MapleStory and The League Fighter and whatnot.

3952
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:37,120
So is this a very MapleStory-esque kind of game or is this like more Warcraft inspired

3953
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:38,440
or what's this game kind of like?

3954
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:40,440
It's like Warcraft meets anime.

3955
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:41,440
Interesting.

3956
03:08:41,440 --> 03:08:43,440
That could be interesting.

3957
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:44,440
And it's free?

3958
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:46,440
Is it ad-supported or what's the deal?

3959
03:08:46,440 --> 03:08:50,320
It's 100% free.

3960
03:08:50,320 --> 03:08:58,880
You can upgrade to a membership for a month, which gives you a possibility to run a guild,

3961
03:08:58,880 --> 03:09:03,120
open shops, use a bag, whatnot.

3962
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:04,120
Cool.

3963
03:09:04,120 --> 03:09:06,280
But this game is being a pain in the ass right now?

3964
03:09:06,280 --> 03:09:10,080
That's why you're saying that role-playing quests are a bitch?

3965
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:18,280
Yes, because each expansion is a generation, otherwise known as a G and then the number

3966
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:20,440
of the expansion level.

3967
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:27,240
And throughout all G1, your character has to role-play as a character named Tarwhak

3968
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:31,400
who pretty much only uses a loot as a weapon, otherwise you can fight bare-handed and use

3969
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:32,400
magic.

3970
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:33,400
Interesting.

3971
03:09:33,400 --> 03:09:34,960
What turned you on to this game?

3972
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:37,800
How'd you find out about it?

3973
03:09:37,800 --> 03:09:42,800
My friend actually plays it, who I was PVPing against.

3974
03:09:42,800 --> 03:09:43,800
Very cool.

3975
03:09:43,800 --> 03:09:44,800
Very cool.

3976
03:09:44,800 --> 03:09:49,320
Quickly, what other games types of stuff are you into?

3977
03:09:49,320 --> 03:09:54,920
I played just about anything except for anything that has Hannah Montana or Barbie attached

3978
03:09:54,920 --> 03:09:55,920
to it.

3979
03:09:55,920 --> 03:10:00,000
You know the Hannah Montana game on DS is apparently pretty sweet, so I'm just saying.

3980
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,640
I heard there was a music game on the DS that was actually pretty sweet.

3981
03:10:02,640 --> 03:10:03,640
Just saying.

3982
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:04,640
All right.

3983
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:05,640
Hannah needs to burp.

3984
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:11,600
All right, any other parting words for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

3985
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:17,360
Hm, the Neutron movie will be epic.

3986
03:10:17,360 --> 03:10:22,100
It better be, because Dark Soccer and I are planning an epic trip that will probably pre-empt

3987
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:27,120
the show to go on this stupid trip, so stay tuned.

3988
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:30,440
All right, thank you so much for the call, Haseo, and stay tuned.

3989
03:10:30,440 --> 03:10:33,040
Are you going to listen for a few more hours to the marathon tonight?

3990
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:35,880
Yes, I'm listening to the whole thing.

3991
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:36,880
The whole thing.

3992
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:37,880
Good luck, buddy.

3993
03:10:37,880 --> 03:10:38,880
All right.

3994
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:39,880
Take care, my friend.

3995
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:40,880
All right, thanks.

3996
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:43,720
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3997
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:45,440
We can fit in one more call.

3998
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:46,440
Why not?

3999
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:47,440
We got time.

4000
03:10:47,440 --> 03:10:48,440
We got a lot of time.

4001
03:10:48,440 --> 03:10:50,440
A lot of time.

4002
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:54,240
1877 Game OLR, if you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4003
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:57,120
Have we figured out the whole dinner thing yet?

4004
03:10:57,120 --> 03:10:58,120
Are we doing a...

4005
03:10:58,120 --> 03:11:00,080
We're going to get taken bakes.

4006
03:11:00,080 --> 03:11:01,080
Awesome.

4007
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:03,040
We wanted someone to make the Papa Murphy's run.

4008
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:04,040
Okay.

4009
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:07,120
When I sober up, I can go, but that's going to take me at least another hour.

4010
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:08,120
Okay.

4011
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:09,120
But I can't drink anything until then.

4012
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:10,120
You want some Triscuits?

4013
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:11,120
Okay.

4014
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:12,120
That would be lovely.

4015
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:13,120
Okay.

4016
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:14,120
All right.

4017
03:11:14,120 --> 03:11:16,600
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4018
03:11:16,600 --> 03:11:18,800
Loki's going to be leaving us after we go to the next break.

4019
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:20,480
I should really take a nap when I get home.

4020
03:11:20,480 --> 03:11:22,720
I woke up at four o'clock in the morning this morning.

4021
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:25,640
I was going to ask, what is it that you're going to be doing when you go home?

4022
03:11:25,640 --> 03:11:26,640
Um...

4023
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:27,640
Babysitting?

4024
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:32,480
I'm going to be watching the baby, probably go to bed at like...

4025
03:11:32,480 --> 03:11:35,640
You know, I always say I'm going to go to bed early, but it ends up being 11.

4026
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:39,820
I'm going to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods if I can, and I have to go grocery shopping

4027
03:11:39,820 --> 03:11:42,040
because we have nothing in the house.

4028
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:49,880
And then what else do I have to do?

4029
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:51,360
Maybe bid on something on eBay.

4030
03:11:51,360 --> 03:11:52,360
Bid on something on eBay.

4031
03:11:52,360 --> 03:11:53,360
Yeah.

4032
03:11:53,360 --> 03:11:54,360
All right.

4033
03:11:54,360 --> 03:11:55,360
Good stuff.

4034
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:56,360
All right.

4035
03:11:56,360 --> 03:11:57,360
I might be...

4036
03:11:57,360 --> 03:12:05,480
Well, I should be getting a Kinect camera in the next few weeks.

4037
03:12:05,480 --> 03:12:06,480
Ooh!

4038
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:07,760
Well, good luck with that.

4039
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:09,380
And this is not one of the beta cameras.

4040
03:12:09,380 --> 03:12:14,960
This is actually the real retail camera with the retail version of Kinect adventures.

4041
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:19,000
If the guy doesn't deliver it, though, then I will give it my back.

4042
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:20,000
Something's going on.

4043
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:21,920
We might not be broadcasting right now.

4044
03:12:21,920 --> 03:12:24,840
It looks like our Winamp is frozen.

4045
03:12:24,840 --> 03:12:27,320
I'm not seeing anything in chat.

4046
03:12:27,320 --> 03:12:31,240
But let's just keep going for the podcast's sake.

4047
03:12:31,240 --> 03:12:34,920
I don't know what's going on.

4048
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:36,280
If folks can hear us or what have you.

4049
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:37,280
But it looks like...

4050
03:12:37,280 --> 03:12:38,280
I'm keeping up with the chat room.

4051
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:39,280
Shit.

4052
03:12:39,280 --> 03:12:41,760
The last thing I saw was somebody saying parting words for Loki.

4053
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:43,320
Did you see anything after that?

4054
03:12:43,320 --> 03:12:44,320
That's all I saw.

4055
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:45,960
I typed while we were broadcasting.

4056
03:12:45,960 --> 03:12:47,600
I didn't see that.

4057
03:12:47,600 --> 03:12:48,600
Something's wrong.

4058
03:12:48,600 --> 03:12:49,600
So they're not hearing us right now.

4059
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:51,240
I'm going to start and stop our feed.

4060
03:12:51,240 --> 03:12:52,240
Yeah.

4061
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:54,160
It says my nickname's in use already.

4062
03:12:54,160 --> 03:12:55,160
Shit.

4063
03:12:55,160 --> 03:12:56,160
I'm disconnected.

4064
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:57,160
Okay.

4065
03:12:57,160 --> 03:12:58,160
That's not good.

4066
03:12:58,160 --> 03:12:59,160
So we're going to...

4067
03:12:59,160 --> 03:13:00,160
Oh, now I'm back.

4068
03:13:00,160 --> 03:13:02,480
We're going to reconnect right now.

4069
03:13:02,480 --> 03:13:04,880
How many times is this going to happen tonight?

4070
03:13:04,880 --> 03:13:07,220
Oh, shit.

4071
03:13:07,220 --> 03:13:09,240
And I reconnected using the wrong encoder.

4072
03:13:09,240 --> 03:13:10,600
That's real good, Rob.

4073
03:13:10,600 --> 03:13:13,240
Real good.

4074
03:13:13,240 --> 03:13:18,960
Live radio, the joys, the perils, the heartache, the trials, the tribulations.

4075
03:13:18,960 --> 03:13:19,960
Okay.

4076
03:13:19,960 --> 03:13:20,960
We're back up.

4077
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:21,960
We're live.

4078
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:23,440
So slowly folks are going to be coming back on.

4079
03:13:23,440 --> 03:13:27,060
That might explain why the Skype line hasn't been ringing if our internet just suddenly

4080
03:13:27,060 --> 03:13:28,600
decided to crap out.

4081
03:13:28,600 --> 03:13:29,600
All right.

4082
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,520
It looks like I'm reconnecting slowly but surely.

4083
03:13:31,520 --> 03:13:32,520
Oh, no.

4084
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:33,520
It died again.

4085
03:13:33,520 --> 03:13:34,520
I've been on AIM the entire time.

4086
03:13:34,520 --> 03:13:35,520
It just died again.

4087
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:36,520
It died again?

4088
03:13:36,520 --> 03:13:40,440
I've been on AIM the entire time and had no problem.

4089
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:46,600
It shows that we are connected on Shoutcast.

4090
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:48,600
This is bad stuff.

4091
03:13:48,600 --> 03:13:51,320
Says auto-excessive connections from a single host.

4092
03:13:51,320 --> 03:13:52,320
Oh, fuck.

4093
03:13:52,320 --> 03:13:55,640
G line from Game Surge.

4094
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:59,440
So we got booted from chat altogether because there's too many of us trying to connect because

4095
03:13:59,440 --> 03:14:02,280
our ghosts were still lurking there.

4096
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:03,280
That's great.

4097
03:14:03,280 --> 03:14:05,980
So we might've just lost the chat room for the rest of the evening.

4098
03:14:05,980 --> 03:14:07,080
That is wonderful.

4099
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:11,200
Those G lines reset after like 10, 15 minutes.

4100
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:12,200
It really depends.

4101
03:14:12,200 --> 03:14:13,200
Yeah.

4102
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:14,200
Do they?

4103
03:14:14,200 --> 03:14:15,200
Yeah.

4104
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:16,200
All right.

4105
03:14:16,200 --> 03:14:17,200
Have some driscuits, Rob.

4106
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:18,200
Great.

4107
03:14:18,200 --> 03:14:19,200
So now we have to marathon with no chat room.

4108
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,200
This ought to be lovely.

4109
03:14:20,200 --> 03:14:21,200
For now.

4110
03:14:21,200 --> 03:14:22,200
Well.

4111
03:14:22,200 --> 03:14:23,200
Well, that sucks.

4112
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:24,200
Got to go now.

4113
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:25,200
All right.

4114
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:26,200
This is great.

4115
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:35,600
If I probably load the Twitter, there's going to be a million people tweeting going.

4116
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:39,280
Try it through the web browser because that uses like a proxy thing.

4117
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:40,280
Oh, does it?

4118
03:14:40,280 --> 03:14:41,280
I'll do that.

4119
03:14:41,280 --> 03:14:43,680
I need someone to help me fill time here real quick.

4120
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:44,680
Something so.

4121
03:14:44,680 --> 03:14:45,680
I'm sorry.

4122
03:14:45,680 --> 03:14:46,680
We're all here chewing on triscuits.

4123
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:47,680
Yep.

4124
03:14:47,680 --> 03:14:48,680
That's the marathon.

4125
03:14:48,680 --> 03:14:58,640
It's just going to be like eight hours of this chewing on triscuits and Rob hunting

4126
03:14:58,640 --> 03:14:59,640
down a way to get in.

4127
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:00,640
I need to get our chat.

4128
03:15:00,640 --> 03:15:01,640
The chat's like, Oh God.

4129
03:15:01,640 --> 03:15:02,640
It wants me to install Java.

4130
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:06,560
Let me try to reconnect here real quick on the old fashioned way.

4131
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:10,180
See if that works.

4132
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:11,180
We need chat.

4133
03:15:11,180 --> 03:15:12,760
Our Skype line is supposedly open.

4134
03:15:12,760 --> 03:15:15,920
So if somebody can hear us, somebody call us shit.

4135
03:15:15,920 --> 03:15:24,200
Yeah, no, it's showing that we're G line still because I guess too many of us run at once.

4136
03:15:24,200 --> 03:15:25,200
We're up though.

4137
03:15:25,200 --> 03:15:32,440
According to try the chat app and IE maybe if it's on that machine.

4138
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:35,800
Because Java may be separate for Firefox if that's what you're using.

4139
03:15:35,800 --> 03:15:41,600
Um, let me, Oh, I will do that.

4140
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:45,400
Our Skype line is still open one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype is

4141
03:15:45,400 --> 03:15:48,960
orange lounge radio.

4142
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:51,040
Your mic is also dying a lot.

4143
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:52,040
I'm in web chat.

4144
03:15:52,040 --> 03:15:53,040
Trying to get there.

4145
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:54,040
Anyway.

4146
03:15:54,040 --> 03:15:55,040
Are you?

4147
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:57,200
It still says G line for web chat.

4148
03:15:57,200 --> 03:15:59,840
So Oh, Oh, we're getting at least a call.

4149
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:00,840
Hi.

4150
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:01,840
We're on orange.

4151
03:16:01,840 --> 03:16:02,840
Who's this?

4152
03:16:02,840 --> 03:16:03,840
It's Rodney again.

4153
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:06,640
Just calling your support team staff because that's pretty much what I am.

4154
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:07,640
You again.

4155
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:08,640
All right.

4156
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:09,760
Well, uh, we're, we're up, right?

4157
03:16:09,760 --> 03:16:11,120
You guys can hear us again?

4158
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:12,120
Yeah.

4159
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:13,120
We can hear you fine.

4160
03:16:13,120 --> 03:16:16,280
It's just that the whole G line thing, cause that popped up those, that happens when it's

4161
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:21,780
like more than three or four people from the same IP that logs into the chat, which is

4162
03:16:21,780 --> 03:16:24,760
custom that dark soccer, myself and Loki will all log in.

4163
03:16:24,760 --> 03:16:28,920
But unfortunately when we tried to log back in after we got booted from our internet,

4164
03:16:28,920 --> 03:16:29,920
we all got G lines.

4165
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:32,360
So yeah, we don't have a chat right now.

4166
03:16:32,360 --> 03:16:35,800
I just sent you guys a tweet, how to, how to circumvent the whole thing.

4167
03:16:35,800 --> 03:16:41,520
Um, I think don't, don't we just have to wait like 15 minutes and we'll be fine.

4168
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:43,760
I don't know how long you have to wait.

4169
03:16:43,760 --> 03:16:47,720
I'm just saying if you go to mibbit.com, it'll, you can log in that way.

4170
03:16:47,720 --> 03:16:48,720
All right.

4171
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:49,720
Maybe we'll look at that.

4172
03:16:49,720 --> 03:16:50,720
All right.

4173
03:16:50,720 --> 03:16:51,720
We'll look into that.

4174
03:16:51,720 --> 03:16:52,720
Dark soccer's looking at that.

4175
03:16:52,720 --> 03:16:53,720
I tried.

4176
03:16:53,720 --> 03:16:54,720
It didn't work.

4177
03:16:54,720 --> 03:16:55,720
All right.

4178
03:16:55,720 --> 03:16:56,720
Let me take a call.

4179
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:57,720
I'm gonna take a call from another number.

4180
03:16:57,720 --> 03:16:58,720
Okay.

4181
03:16:58,720 --> 03:16:59,720
All right.

4182
03:16:59,720 --> 03:17:00,720
Let me take a call from Eric.

4183
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:01,720
Hello.

4184
03:17:01,720 --> 03:17:02,720
This is Eric Hatcher, AKA Tri-Team.

4185
03:17:02,720 --> 03:17:05,720
I've been a long time listener, but I work mostly.

4186
03:17:05,720 --> 03:17:08,200
Oh, well, Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

4187
03:17:08,200 --> 03:17:10,940
We're having, this is a heck of a night to call in and we're just having technical difficulties

4188
03:17:10,940 --> 03:17:11,940
left and right.

4189
03:17:11,940 --> 03:17:12,940
We can't see our audience right now.

4190
03:17:12,940 --> 03:17:17,520
Well, that's probably the reason I called, I guess I'm, uh, if I sound out of breath,

4191
03:17:17,520 --> 03:17:21,720
it's cause I'm on the walking track and I'm using you guys to pass the time while I work

4192
03:17:21,720 --> 03:17:25,720
off the weight on my long ass game butt.

4193
03:17:25,720 --> 03:17:26,720
Wow.

4194
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:29,000
What, what, what types of games do you, uh, what types of games are you into?

4195
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,000
What types of games do you play?

4196
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:31,000
Oh, just a little bit of everything.

4197
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:38,040
Um, pretty much all the modern systems, I'd say, uh, I'm mostly the Xbox 360 and, uh,

4198
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:43,720
of course I get my NMO RPG, uh, still on EverQuest still.

4199
03:17:43,720 --> 03:17:45,960
Still EverQuest after all these years?

4200
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:46,960
Why EverQuest?

4201
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:52,680
Well, I guess just cause of the people I know there, I've been, uh, on the same, well, other

4202
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:57,000
than the server mergers, I've been on the same server for 11 years now.

4203
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,720
And it's, it's probably the people that keep you coming back, huh?

4204
03:17:59,720 --> 03:18:00,720
Really?

4205
03:18:00,720 --> 03:18:02,040
That is exactly what it is.

4206
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:05,520
Yeah, I can see that cause, uh, that's part of the, pretty much a lot of the reason why

4207
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:06,520
I keep playing Wow.

4208
03:18:06,520 --> 03:18:10,060
Like, I know a lot of people are like, oh, you're an addict, you play Wow all the time

4209
03:18:10,060 --> 03:18:11,060
and so forth.

4210
03:18:11,060 --> 03:18:14,440
I'm like, well, it's really the social element, the game I can kind of give or take, but it's

4211
03:18:14,440 --> 03:18:18,800
really the, excuse me, the social element that keeps me coming back.

4212
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:24,840
I agree 100%, that's exactly why I've kept playing for so long.

4213
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:25,840
So very cool.

4214
03:18:25,840 --> 03:18:30,000
Well, um, let's see, any new stories that you want to comment on that we talked about

4215
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:31,000
tonight?

4216
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:32,800
Uh, I don't know.

4217
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:39,240
I haven't, uh, I just talked, uh, oh, the last about 20 or 30 minutes or so, something

4218
03:18:39,240 --> 03:18:43,640
I guess I'd like to talk about is, uh, I don't know if y'all are familiar, there's a game

4219
03:18:43,640 --> 03:18:47,800
that came out within the last couple of weeks, uh, last week or so called elemental, the

4220
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:51,720
war of magic on the PC, it paddles a lot of trouble.

4221
03:18:51,720 --> 03:18:52,960
I think I've heard of it.

4222
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:56,200
Uh, yeah, I don't think I've played, I know I haven't played it, but I think I've heard

4223
03:18:56,200 --> 03:18:57,200
of this.

4224
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,200
Tell us a little bit more about this game.

4225
03:18:58,200 --> 03:19:04,160
Well, it's, uh, by, uh, the company StarDuck and, uh, StarDock and, uh, Brad Wardall is,

4226
03:19:04,160 --> 03:19:07,160
uh, probably the lead designer on that, I believe.

4227
03:19:07,160 --> 03:19:13,640
Pretty, uh, nice guy, but this is the worst, uh, um, most, ws piece of software I've played

4228
03:19:13,640 --> 03:19:22,200
in the last 20 years, I guess, of playing, uh, computer games.

4229
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:24,200
Hmm.

4230
03:19:24,200 --> 03:19:28,120
Which is very unfortunate, the game has a lot of potential, if any of you are familiar

4231
03:19:28,120 --> 03:19:34,480
with, uh, Masters of Magic, it's sort of a civilization-like game with a fantasy bent.

4232
03:19:34,480 --> 03:19:37,600
Ooh, those are like all of my favorite games you just said.

4233
03:19:37,600 --> 03:19:44,600
Exactly, and, uh, it has so much potential, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.

4234
03:19:44,600 --> 03:19:46,320
That's too bad.

4235
03:19:46,320 --> 03:19:50,680
I hate it when you got a game that sounds like such a good idea, like on paper, but

4236
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:52,560
then in execution it sucks.

4237
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:53,560
Ah, exactly.

4238
03:19:53,560 --> 03:19:54,560
Yeah.

4239
03:19:54,560 --> 03:20:01,120
Uh, anyway, I just mostly called to help you out with a little bit of time, I don't really

4240
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:02,480
have a whole lot to say.

4241
03:20:02,480 --> 03:20:03,480
That's alright, we like hearing from you.

4242
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:04,480
Wait, where'd you say you're calling from?

4243
03:20:04,480 --> 03:20:05,480
Uh, big pardon?

4244
03:20:05,480 --> 03:20:08,480
Where'd you say you're calling from?

4245
03:20:08,480 --> 03:20:11,880
Oh, uh, basically Birmingham, Alabama.

4246
03:20:11,880 --> 03:20:12,880
Really?

4247
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:13,880
From my home state then?

4248
03:20:13,880 --> 03:20:14,880
Oh, exactly.

4249
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:21,480
Now, I've, I've, uh, spent many, many a time up in Birmingham, and, uh, although I spent

4250
03:20:21,480 --> 03:20:28,440
more time around Dothan and Montgomery, so, but yeah, Mobile's my hometown.

4251
03:20:28,440 --> 03:20:30,440
So nice to talk to someone from my home state.

4252
03:20:30,440 --> 03:20:31,440
Welcome.

4253
03:20:31,440 --> 03:20:32,440
Woo!

4254
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:37,960
Nice talking to y'all, and I look forward to seeing you more as they continue to progress.

4255
03:20:37,960 --> 03:20:38,960
Alright, sounds good.

4256
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:39,960
You have a good one, buddy.

4257
03:20:39,960 --> 03:20:40,960
Take care.

4258
03:20:40,960 --> 03:20:41,960
Thanks for tuning in.

4259
03:20:41,960 --> 03:20:42,960
Take care.

4260
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:43,960
Bye bye.

4261
03:20:43,960 --> 03:20:44,960
Bye bye.

4262
03:20:44,960 --> 03:20:45,960
Alright.

4263
03:20:45,960 --> 03:20:48,640
I can almost always pick out an Alabama accent.

4264
03:20:48,640 --> 03:20:49,640
Yeah?

4265
03:20:49,640 --> 03:20:51,880
So I was like, bing!

4266
03:20:51,880 --> 03:20:52,880
Radar.

4267
03:20:52,880 --> 03:20:53,880
Nice.

4268
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:55,080
Alright, well, we're gonna go ahead and go to a break.

4269
03:20:55,080 --> 03:21:00,680
I am actually, I just downloaded an IRC chat client to my phone to try and connect.

4270
03:21:00,680 --> 03:21:01,920
Oh, there we go.

4271
03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:04,240
I got it.

4272
03:21:04,240 --> 03:21:06,560
And they're saying, wait, did Loki, yeah, I can see chat.

4273
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:09,480
So I have chat open on my phone right now.

4274
03:21:09,480 --> 03:21:12,820
So I finally have a lifeblood into the chat room, so, uh, there you go.

4275
03:21:12,820 --> 03:21:16,360
So chatters, I can now see you again.

4276
03:21:16,360 --> 03:21:19,240
Don't send me private messages if you figure out what my name is on there.

4277
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:20,360
It's not too hard to figure out.

4278
03:21:20,360 --> 03:21:21,360
Don't send me private messages.

4279
03:21:21,360 --> 03:21:23,840
Oh, we had another call coming in.

4280
03:21:23,840 --> 03:21:25,520
This will be our last call before we take another break.

4281
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:26,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

4282
03:21:26,520 --> 03:21:27,520
Who's this?

4283
03:21:27,520 --> 03:21:28,520
This is Toa Gak.

4284
03:21:28,520 --> 03:21:29,520
Hey, Toa Gak.

4285
03:21:29,520 --> 03:21:30,520
How are you, buddy?

4286
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:31,520
What's on your mind?

4287
03:21:31,520 --> 03:21:38,400
Um, I just called in because I'm going to give you the URL you'd need to go to to get

4288
03:21:38,400 --> 03:21:39,600
the G line removed.

4289
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:41,880
Okay, what is that?

4290
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:49,640
It's gamesurge.net slash utils slash G line.

4291
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:53,560
All right, I'm looking at that right now.

4292
03:21:53,560 --> 03:21:57,920
Oh, one G line found for your host resolved in an hour.

4293
03:21:57,920 --> 03:22:07,400
Okay, so I'm on that page and it says why we're banned, okay.

4294
03:22:07,400 --> 03:22:11,200
It will only last one hour, so there you go.

4295
03:22:11,200 --> 03:22:13,160
We just have to wait out the hour then.

4296
03:22:13,160 --> 03:22:14,160
Jerks.

4297
03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:15,160
That's okay.

4298
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:18,280
So we got till 6 25 and no chat, but that's okay because I got chat on my phone.

4299
03:22:18,280 --> 03:22:19,280
I figured it out.

4300
03:22:19,280 --> 03:22:20,280
I worked around.

4301
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:21,280
All right.

4302
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:22,280
Hi.

4303
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:23,280
Just a, um, listener.

4304
03:22:23,280 --> 03:22:37,980
Just a reminder, it's probably a bad idea to circumvent it, the G line, because they

4305
03:22:37,980 --> 03:22:38,980
can tell.

4306
03:22:38,980 --> 03:22:40,840
Well, no, I'm on my iPhone.

4307
03:22:40,840 --> 03:22:41,840
It's three G.

4308
03:22:41,840 --> 03:22:42,840
It's okay.

4309
03:22:42,840 --> 03:22:43,840
We'll be okay.

4310
03:22:43,840 --> 03:22:44,840
We're not on Comcast.

4311
03:22:44,840 --> 03:22:45,840
It shows us three G.

4312
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:46,840
Well, it'll be our little secret.

4313
03:22:46,840 --> 03:22:47,840
Okay.

4314
03:22:47,840 --> 03:22:48,840
All right.

4315
03:22:48,840 --> 03:22:49,840
All right.

4316
03:22:49,840 --> 03:22:51,880
Well, thanks for the tip.

4317
03:22:51,880 --> 03:22:52,880
We appreciate it.

4318
03:22:52,880 --> 03:22:55,520
At least we know it's only for an hour, so we know we'll be able to get back in.

4319
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:57,520
All right.

4320
03:22:57,520 --> 03:22:59,520
Have a good one, buddy.

4321
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:00,520
Okay.

4322
03:23:00,520 --> 03:23:01,520
Bye.

4323
03:23:01,520 --> 03:23:02,520
Thanks for the tip.

4324
03:23:02,520 --> 03:23:03,520
All right.

4325
03:23:03,520 --> 03:23:06,160
We're gonna on that note, I think we need a break after that.

4326
03:23:06,160 --> 03:23:07,160
Oh boy.

4327
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:08,160
All right.

4328
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:09,480
Uh, people are saying hi.

4329
03:23:09,480 --> 03:23:10,480
Why were you banned?

4330
03:23:10,480 --> 03:23:13,320
Well, they don't like more than three people on the same IP.

4331
03:23:13,320 --> 03:23:14,320
Dranami's got it there.

4332
03:23:14,320 --> 03:23:19,520
And they're saying, actually, it's five, says Toa Gak, but, uh, I don't...

4333
03:23:19,520 --> 03:23:20,520
The various...

4334
03:23:20,520 --> 03:23:24,400
It says three, um, on the page that explains why you're G aligned.

4335
03:23:24,400 --> 03:23:25,400
It's weird.

4336
03:23:25,400 --> 03:23:29,260
When various clients try to reconnect and disconnect due to internet issues within a

4337
03:23:29,260 --> 03:23:33,080
certain amount of time, the server has no way of knowing what's going on and it kind

4338
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:34,080
of thinks it's a DDoS.

4339
03:23:34,080 --> 03:23:36,200
It's a denial of service, I get it.

4340
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:38,360
So it's, it's just a fail safe.

4341
03:23:38,360 --> 03:23:40,760
I'll forgive them someday.

4342
03:23:40,760 --> 03:23:42,480
I'll find it in my heart to forgive them.

4343
03:23:42,480 --> 03:23:43,480
All right.

4344
03:23:43,480 --> 03:23:47,040
We're going to, um, actually say goodbye to Loki at this point before we go to another

4345
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:48,040
break.

4346
03:23:48,040 --> 03:23:49,920
And, uh, Loki, any final words for our listeners tonight?

4347
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:51,800
No, I just have to go get groceries.

4348
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:52,800
That's always fun.

4349
03:23:52,800 --> 03:23:54,320
I guess I don't like chores.

4350
03:23:54,320 --> 03:23:55,320
All right.

4351
03:23:55,320 --> 03:23:56,320
Well, good luck with all that.

4352
03:23:56,320 --> 03:24:00,680
Uh, this is actually the part of the show where we would be saying basically, uh, goodnight

4353
03:24:00,680 --> 03:24:01,680
for listening.

4354
03:24:01,680 --> 03:24:04,640
This is kind of the end of the normal part of the show, if you will.

4355
03:24:04,640 --> 03:24:06,200
We're going to be getting into the more random stuff.

4356
03:24:06,200 --> 03:24:09,980
So if you're just looking for your normal quote unquote edition of orange launch radio,

4357
03:24:09,980 --> 03:24:13,200
this is kind of the end of that part, but we will be back in just a little bit with

4358
03:24:13,200 --> 03:24:14,200
more of orange launch radio.

4359
03:24:14,200 --> 03:24:18,480
Now, just so you know, for the podcast feed, we're going to be releasing the marathon in

4360
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:19,680
bits this week.

4361
03:24:19,680 --> 03:24:22,400
So you may not see everything up right away.

4362
03:24:22,400 --> 03:24:27,160
So you know, just give it a little extra time if the, you know, show, you know, if you're

4363
03:24:27,160 --> 03:24:31,560
done listening to this part of the podcast and you want more, just give it a little more

4364
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:32,560
time.

4365
03:24:32,560 --> 03:24:33,560
That's all we need.

4366
03:24:33,560 --> 03:24:39,760
Yeah, real quick, I was going to say we're having our game summit, my work game summit

4367
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:40,760
thing.

4368
03:24:40,760 --> 03:24:44,520
You know, we do it usually each year and, uh, we have the game publishers coming out

4369
03:24:44,520 --> 03:24:45,800
and talking about stuff.

4370
03:24:45,800 --> 03:24:50,840
So maybe I'll learn some new information and we can share it appropriate time if you know

4371
03:24:50,840 --> 03:24:51,840
what I mean.

4372
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:52,840
All right.

4373
03:24:52,840 --> 03:24:53,840
And that'll be something to look forward to next week.

4374
03:24:53,840 --> 03:24:54,840
Yes, possibly.

4375
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:57,600
And also hopefully I'll have a new, uh, I've iPod by then.

4376
03:24:57,600 --> 03:24:58,600
All right.

4377
03:24:58,600 --> 03:25:04,240
Well, um, I don't know, should I play the closing song that we usually play at the end

4378
03:25:04,240 --> 03:25:05,240
here?

4379
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:06,240
Play our little closing song.

4380
03:25:06,240 --> 03:25:07,240
Sure.

4381
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:08,240
Cause we got to put it on the podcast anyways.

4382
03:25:08,240 --> 03:25:09,240
Don't you?

4383
03:25:09,240 --> 03:25:10,240
I guess that's true.

4384
03:25:10,240 --> 03:25:11,240
So let me see.

4385
03:25:11,240 --> 03:25:13,400
I now I have to cue that up that that involves work.

4386
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:14,400
So good night everybody.

4387
03:25:14,400 --> 03:25:15,400
Thanks for listening.

4388
03:25:15,400 --> 03:25:16,400
We'll be back though.

4389
03:25:16,400 --> 03:25:19,200
If you are listening live or on podcasts or whatever, we still got the marathon coming

4390
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:21,560
up and plenty more show.

4391
03:25:21,560 --> 03:25:25,300
Um, who knows what randomness is going to happen when we don't have a chat room going

4392
03:25:25,300 --> 03:25:26,300
on here.

4393
03:25:26,300 --> 03:25:31,240
The folks in chat are saying good night and they're waving even though you can't see them

4394
03:25:31,240 --> 03:25:35,920
and I'm getting everything up from, uh, let's see.

4395
03:25:35,920 --> 03:25:39,680
Toa gax says, if my IRC was server was up, I would let them bounce IRC off of me.

4396
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:40,680
Oh, that's a good idea.

4397
03:25:40,680 --> 03:25:44,800
Somebody should put up like a fake fake server that we can go on and at least see our chat

4398
03:25:44,800 --> 03:25:45,800
room still.

4399
03:25:45,800 --> 03:25:46,800
Yeah.

4400
03:25:46,800 --> 03:25:49,160
My roommate has a, um, Linux box running in the spare bedroom.

4401
03:25:49,160 --> 03:25:50,160
Oh really?

4402
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:52,200
So I could shell into that and we can see from there.

4403
03:25:52,200 --> 03:25:55,600
That might be a good idea, but I'm not going to worry about it too much.

4404
03:25:55,600 --> 03:25:56,600
It's just an hour, right?

4405
03:25:56,600 --> 03:25:58,160
We can make it an hour.

4406
03:25:58,160 --> 03:25:59,160
We can do it.

4407
03:25:59,160 --> 03:26:03,360
All right, we're going to play our outro, say good night and we'll be back though with

4408
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:06,000
more of the OLR marathon right after this.

4409
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:10,040
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

4410
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:15,560
Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show.
