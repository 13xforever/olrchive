{"text": " Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on September the 5th of 2010, a Sunday here with our Orange Lounge Radio Marathon. We are almost, what, about 7 hours in at this point now. Dan, check on the pizza. We started at about 2.05 and it's now 8.50 on the west coast here where we tape. You can listen live, of course, to All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. I imagine that's what most of you are doing because the podcast, you'd have to be way, way, way into that now to get to this point. So, anyhow, we were going to do some news here and I was going to open the Skype line again here in just a moment, so we'll have that again open if you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Not just yet, I'm going to open it here in a moment. But we had another question, I guess, come in on Ask Orange Lounge or something. It slipped through the cracks and I thought it was a pretty good question, so I apologize to bother Alan mid-chew there, but do you remember what that question was all about? The extra question we got? Which game or system did you pass up on when it came out that you never bought that you now regret? Or, I thought there was also a question about what system do you regret buying to? Okay, well, let's do both. What system do you regret buying and what thing do you wish you hadn't passed up, I guess that would be? I think for me, the thing that I most regret passing up probably was the Sega Dreamcast the first time it was out. I ended up buying one eventually, but I didn't buy one when it first came out in 99 because that was kind of the period where I was still trying to wrap up all my college stuff and my life was in this total discourse for a while. So I didn't buy one when it first came out, which is a pity because it was kind of an awesome system. So that would probably be my answer, the Sega Dreamcast. I did get one when they were like 40 bucks. Remember when they cut the price down to like 40 bucks? Or at least GameStop was just trying to unload them or something because at that point you could do all the NES emulators on the Dreamcast and all that stuff. It was really cool. So that's when I finally got on the Dreamcast bandwagon, but it was a little bit too late. And keep in mind guys, the Skype line is not open yet. So if you're calling in, hold off, we'll get to the calls a little later here in the program. Alan? I actually was able to buy an original edition of Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Saturn, which came out well after the Saturn was dead. I bought it, took the bus after school to go to the mall, dropped the 70 or 80 bucks for it. I ended up selling it for a killing on eBay. Like two years later, I never touched it. So I bought it, never played it. And Panzer Dragoon Saga is one of the greatest RPGs, especially for the Saturn. And I sold it on eBay for like 200 something bucks and I needed the money. But it's like, why did I do that? Like I had, I just walked into the store and bought it and I never touched it. You could play ours if you want. The N64 I got for Ocarina of Time because I was very, you know, at that age I was very elitist and snobby about CD-ROM versus card and how Nintendo was making the wrong decision. And I bought an N64 just for Ocarina of Time and I never really played any other game. I bought a bunch of games for the N64 and never touched them. So that was probably a waste of money. So those would be the, wait, now you're talking the games you regret buying, right? Yeah those are my two for that. Do you have any for the one that I had answered about the system or game you regret not buying? I really wish I could have checked out the TurboGrafx, but that was a bit out of my league at the time. My friend had one and at the time I thought it was kind of stupid. I gotta be honest like the games I played on it were not that great. Like we played Splatterhouse which was kind of cool. Like in the fact that you know it was Splatterhouse it was kind of like a horror movie type game but otherwise I didn't find the games on it to be that great. And to this day I got to admit I know Dark Soccer's got a lot of love for it. Maybe it's because she's out of the room. I'll dare to say this. I still kind of think the whole thing was kind of overrated. Like it wasn't that great of a system I don't think. Well it was the only system that got the original Street Fighter and it also got you know Castlevania X the lost Castlevania game until recently. And that's cool but you know how many of us actually played that? I mean sure Jamie did but she's you know cray cray. Yeah in a good way. Aside from that all the systems that were even a little bit relevant I had at one point I did get a Genesis. I got it years after everyone else but I got it before the PlayStation one came out. The 32X and the Sega CD were all considered failures so you know don't really have much regrets there. I have the original Lunar on a ROM I can play it on my computer so. For me the system that I regret buying like not don't regret not buying but the game the system I regret buying that I kind of wish I hadn't was a second DS. I had a DS fat and then the original DS and then I bought a DS lite and I don't think I really needed that lite. You don't handheld game at all. I really don't. Unless you're on a plane. Yeah so I honestly think the DS fat would have been good enough for me and I should have never bought the lite and I bought the lite in a moment of weakness I bought it when I was traveling and literally had like nothing else to do so I went to a local game stop in the town and bought the lite and I kind of wish I hadn't. What about the PSP fat? I'm sure you have one of those right? I did and I ended up getting a PSP 3000 as well but you know what I actually would play the PSP probably more than I did the DS. Just the certain games that were on it with luminous and the final fantasy remakes and so forth. I mean don't get me wrong the DS had its games too but I don't know also the PSP one I kind of wore it down and it didn't work as well anymore so it kind of justified for me the PSP 3000 even though that's probably not like the greatest reason to have one if that makes sense but yeah. I know the idea of buying a movie on UMD is kind of ridiculous but if you can get you know Kill Bill on UMD it fries for like five bucks that's got a better strain on it than your iPhone does really. Oh yeah. To watch a movie on that. Good stuff. Dar Sacra we're talking about the system or console you regret most buying and then the one you regret not buying. I don't really have anything that I regret buying I guess if I was going to pick one it would be the game com because it was awful. I don't even regret the end gauge because I had some good stuff on there but as far as things I regret not buying. You know what's funny Robert M. in chat gave the same answer almost at the same time the game com this is where you're at. I'm because I haven't really passed up anything. I think maybe no I have Proteus salamander deluxe pack because Dan's been wanting it lately. Oh on the PSP? No the Saturn. Oh because they have they have a gratius collection on PSP I think they did a salamander one. I've regretted never buying a duo RX because we could certainly use one. Bradley? Okay let's see what I regret and probably not buying was I never got a Dreamcast. I hear all the great stories about it and I just never got around to it. I don't know I don't think this might have been the time. I did have a job at the time so I didn't really have couldn't get it. The system was truly ahead of its time if it had come out like two years later with DVD support I think I honestly think it would have whipped the PlayStation 2. I really truly think that. I know I'm crazy but I do. Yeah I don't think there's any systems that I regret buying because I think I like all my systems that I have. His story about Prince of Dragoon makes me reminds me I actually had to sell mine off because I was I had like no money at the time and really regret doing that and really didn't want to buy it back. I actually did win an auction for it on eBay for like 200 something bucks but the guy never shipped it which was really annoying. He kept saying he wasn't going to ship it but he didn't and it gave him like a fake code or something but since I did it through PayPal I was able to get the money back at least for that so I can see if I can find it again sometime. The game I regret of buying was the sequel to Alex Kidd in Miracle World. I can't remember what it was called. Alex Kidd 2 something is just because Alex Kidd in Miracle World is a great game. It takes a while to get through it and it takes a while to figure it out because I played it again like a few years ago and I couldn't get through it because there's like some spikes and stuff in the last few levels that can be kind of hard to get past. But the second game is like it's a really easy instead of having like the map like the first one has and the first one is not exactly it's not linear or it's not left to right it's left to right and up and down depending on the level but in the second game you only go left to right and it's actually a really easy game. I beat it the first day and it's like really disappointing just because of how great the first game was. Alright good answers guys. I think we're going to do some quick news stories. We had a couple left over that we never got around to and then we actually have some other discussion topics. So Dark Soccer I don't know if you have the piece on the last one that we had left over that we didn't get to before dinner. I do. About Telltale. Basically Telltale is doing a five episode Back to the Future series and it's going to have Marty McFly and Doc Brown. It has Christopher Lloyd voicing Doc Brown which is great and Hill Valley being 1985 and guidance from the screenwriter Bob Gale and the DeLorean. So they're still working on getting the rest of it up but they're still a bit missing you know. I guess what? Hoverboards and Huey Lewis in the news. I'm looking forward to seeing like what the actual game looks like. You know we've heard a lot of talk about the game and kind of like ramping up to it. I'm kind of excited to see what the damn thing actually looks like but I'm sure it'll be fine. I have some trivia for you. You can kind of guess because can I tell you a secret? Like a lot of people are going to judge me for this but I don't really care. I have never seen Back to the Future one or two. We can fix that. But I have seen part three isn't that weird? The Wild West one. I saw one and then I saw three I didn't see two for the longest time. I never saw one or two. But Rob. What? Here's some trivia for you. On the Back to the Future pinball table you know that Michael J. Fox would not allow his likeness to be used so they made a generic looking dude. I think I know that because you've brought it up on the show before. Actually true story. True story. Alright. One other story for you guys and it has to do with the Connect Beta is going on right now of course. They're starting to ship out and all that good stuff. Someone is trying to sell theirs on eBay. They're trying to get twelve hundred dollars for it. But it was quickly taken offline. I'm assuming Microsoft sent a cease and desist to the kind of folks at eBay. So probably Microsoft did not take kindly to the fact that the unit was being sold. The seller on eBay was Blue Room Project and there were no bids actually made on the system. So there it was. What's interesting about it though is that I would think that this and the article kind of gets into this too is that you would think these connects are going to be sending back quite a bit of data to Microsoft servers so it could kind of figure out who's playing connect that shouldn't be. Right? Like if you get a connect early aren't you kind of setting yourself up for trouble unless you never sign on to Xbox Live which I guess you could do but then how would you get the patches and all that stuff. It just seems tricky tricky. I wish Loki was here to explain a little more about how you could get around that but I'm just thinking you know what probably not a good idea to just buy these that you don't really have the rights because Microsoft can track what goes online and you're going to have to go online to get some of the patches and updates so it just doesn't make sense. That was it for the news. That was all the news we had set to cover this show. So if you have more stories you want to talk about we're actually going to open up the Skype line. Now it is open folks. 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio. We're going to take some more calls. So you can either call us and talk to us about a news story or really anything you've heard about tonight or you can send us a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can send us a tweet and we'll read those again in a little bit if we're getting some tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r and I think Dark Soccer had mentioned something about wanting to do the mailbag again but I don't know if any letters have dropped in. We're kind of monitoring all those pretty closely right now. I'm actually going to kind of load up the tweets. Let's see how those are going. Alright we are getting some calls. Let's go to the phones. Hi you're on OrangeLawnTradio who's this? Hey this is XLink. Hey XLink welcome to hour 7 of the marathon. How ya doing? Doing good and you? I'm still awake that's a good thing. What's on your mind? Nothing much. I'm really excited to hear that they are going to do a mini series based on Back to the Future which is hopefully going to be epic now they're getting actual actors to do the voices from the movie and stuff so that's going to be cool. I would love to see Michael J. Fox come on also because that would be excellent. Also Telltale also got excited for it because they announced a new poker game coming out this fall with different characters from different game series. Poker Night at the Inventory with Tycho from Penny Arcade, the Strong Bad from Home Star Runner, Max from Sam & Max and then the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. So that should be pretty interesting of a poker game when they get that all said and done. Yeah to be fair it was brought up about 6 hours ago but yeah we did talk about it a little bit but it sounds kind of interesting. I'm not usually somebody that gets super into the poker games but I kind of like where this one's going. It's an interesting hodgepodge of characters. What do you kind of hope you get out of this poker game? Just the wackiness because of Telltale and the way they're going to put this together there's going to be some kind of epic fighting going on between characters and stuff which is going to be absolutely great to see. That's the over-slapstick humor that they usually do with some of their games. So what else is on your mind? Anything? No I've been playing a lot of WoW as of course you should know. Of course because I play a lot of WoW too. Fancy that. Yeah we all do. What are some of your WoW accomplishments recently? Almost had the TOC 25 which I would have been very proud of. Just a lot of different odds and ends. ICC getting farther than that now in the 10 man so with the guild. Hopefully I'm really going to be proud because I'm going to try to go for some of the other odds and ends like the fishing mounts and stuff like that. Awesome. Yeah so. Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you go and take more calls? Nope that's pretty much about it. Well you have a good night good luck with WoW. Thank you you too. Alright bye. Alright 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio you can give us a call. Alright. I was just ringing off the hook a minute ago so I'm hoping more calls will come in. We are getting some tweets thank you guys. Twitter.com slash OLR we'll get to those in just a moment. How you doing over there DuckSock are you good? Yeah I'm a little woozy. From the drinking? Yeah I'm starting to get a little like heyyyy. Brandy hits me really fast. I don't care. Alright hey you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this? Hi this is Spazzinator. Hey Spazzinator welcome to the marathon what's on your mind? Yeah well this is probably a question that's probably better answered by Loki but since he took off a few hours ago I'll ask you guys. I'm kind of sort of toying around with the idea of more or less recreating our K-Camp that I once saw going years back. I don't know if you've ever seen this one particular model. It had a samurai showdown 4 in it and basically the configuration was and it came in two pieces. The one section had the joysticks and the buns and the coin slots and all that and maybe the second piece was basically the monitoring. There was like 5 or 10 feet away and there was like a chain flicking the two together. Wait wait wait you gotta back up here. This was a special machine or a custom machine you're saying? Yeah I think more or less recreating at least part of the custom machine for myself or at least the part with the controls on it. You know aside from the part with the controls like the joystick and all that I was wondering what kind of materials do you think I should be using to build the cabin itself like should I use like particle boards and laminate or? Yeah this is definitely a low key question because I don't know anything about this stuff but I will tell you one like somewhat cheap alternative that I've heard being used before is like actually trying to find old arcade cabinets that for whatever reason the games inside them don't work anymore because the cabinets seem to make pretty good shells for these custom cabinets for whatever it is you're trying to build. A samurai showdown 4 case or whatever it is. Those are usually a really good place to start at least from what I've heard and I think that's what quite a few people have done. Like don't you guys have like a custom cabinet in some time? We just modified a pole position back in the day and used it and put a damp built the layout and everything with the buttons and joysticks. Yeah. Otherwise as far as like specific materials that work best not really my realm of expertise because I've never built a cabinet so I'm not going to profess to know that stuff but I'm sure there are some websites or yeah Loki is a good resource you know when he's here when he's not babysitting. Yeah ultimately my goal is to you know like let's say get you know to use this is just an example I'm thinking of gaining one of those $150 arcade sticks for the PNC or 360 drop drop that into the cabinet run but arcade sticks wires to my gain system and then in turn have my gain system go to my high def TV and more or less kind of sort of have a arcade cabinet but not quite. Well I know that Loki was also going to be working on a project about building arcade cabinets for like a hundred bucks so you know I'm all about building on a budget that's for sure. Alright well thanks for taking my call. Alright. Alright have a good one. You too buddy have a good night. You too. Alright. 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. Yeah we're taking more calls I've been seeing quite a few it's like they'll all come in all at once. I think you can tell when like the 30 seconds catches up to everybody because you know there's time from the time we say something to encode to send all games to broadcast to you so like I think after that 30 seconds is up like the phone just lights up it's kind of awesome. Take a few more calls here and then maybe go back to the Twitter. Did we check the email bag? Do we have any new emails to go to? I think they were junk mail. Stupid spammers. Spammers need to go kill themselves. Not really though but yes. Alright more calls. Hi you're on orange lounge radio the marathon who's this? Legend of Zaku from your cell phone. Hey Legend of Zaku from your cell phone. Welcome to hour 7 of the marathon what's up? Oh wow you guys are really pushing it this time aren't you? Yeah a little bit. We haven't done a show this long since DDR tournaments that's for sure. Right so yeah apparently the the biggest thing right now is Duke Nukem Forever basically coming back from the dead in a more spectacular way. I never thought it would actually happen. Oh yes what do you think about all this news that has come out of Penny Arcade Expo? All I know is that it you know it better they better just stick to the schedule get it out because the last thing we need is for other folks to just you know have this game be the butt of everyone's joke again. At the same time though at this point Zaku what's another year? Like you know if they if they delay it to 2012 what's another year at this point? But but the game is so close I mean people are already playing a demo of it and what I hear is like at polishing stages. No I get it it's just like. I agree if they're showing it on the floor at Penny Arcade Expo it's darn close to done and they're they're really I mean showing it at Penny Arcade Expo keep in mind they bypassed E3 to make this announcement they if this has been in development since 2009 they could have announced this at E3 but they didn't they went and took it directly to people like you and me at Penny Arcade Expo that's like unzipping it and whipping it out on the table for everybody to admire that's what. Then again this game actually appeals to the hardcore demographic not necessarily something you would want you know average Joe gamer who pretty much doesn't have a clue as to what Duke Nukem is unless they have been playing during the you know mid to late 90s. Well I mean they've tried to drop these little inklings of Duke Nukem to put it back in our consciousness in the past couple years like the Duke Nukem release on Xbox Live and I think there's another like isn't there a 2D Duke Nukem game set to come out? Pretty much I mean the whole point is that I guess I kind of find it surprising that the first you know you know the studio behind Borderlands and the guys found it it pretty much has connection to 3D Realms and the you know and the folks who ran it up until its demise. I never thought is you know that guy's career is pretty much owed to Duke Nukem. Well now I'm wondering though if um you know they knew that they had this game that Gearbox has had this game since like 2009 like when did Duke Nukem come out? Didn't it come out about a year ago? I guess I guess it would be about I'm wondering if they didn't push out that Duke Nukem Live around the time that they knew that Gearbox would be taking this game on to kind of help push Duke Nukem back to the front of everybody's minds like that's kind of one thing I'm thinking now in retrospect. Wondering how the timing of everything worked out. All I know is that basically from what I read in the article like a Taco article when they interviewed you know that guy basically after 3D Realms shut down most of it was pretty much a two bit operation running from people's apartments. Pretty much a garage game up until a point where Gearbox took control of it. So it was pretty much it was pretty much coming together piecemeal so there's no way you would mount something unless you have a solid backing from one of the developers able to actually finish the job instead of putting it through development hell. 15 years is like pretty much pushing it for any product. You know even Starcraft 2 but then again Blizzard took their time and they got it out the door. But 3D Realms pretty much you know that's what cost them you know that's what took the studio down with them. The fact they couldn't deliver. Well I mean you know again it's been shown now it's something that is actually going to come out so we'll you know see what happens. Right and hopefully everything everything will make sense and at least I can hear more like one liners out of this guy. That's pretty much what OLR needs a lot more Duke Nukem one liners out of nowhere. I don't know the soundboard is kind of saved for special occasions we'll see. And real quick a comment from our chat room Derek H is asking is the caller saying that 3D Realms was a garage development house? No I'm just saying that after 3D Realms blew up because of Duke Nukem Forever's development the folks from 3D Realms in the transition the gearbox you know in between that time started working you know worked on Duke Nukem Forever from their apartment. So some of it during that time with 3D Realms the demise still got handed over the gearbox was pretty much a two-bit operation. I know 3D Realms pretty much a you know big-name studio back in the day. Hell they really they turned out a lot of PC types and now I'm pretty much fond of. All right. So I hope you know. Well I think it's going to be great. The only thing that's going to be sad is that since it's not you know just like Borderlands you're not going to get quests in Duke Nukem as far as I know so it won't be like you know hey you need to go up to the stripper and tipper although I guess you do have to press R to pee in the toilet. No the whole point of Duke Nukem is just pick up and play you know kill people max out on your on your try to like get all the power ups and weapons and just go all out. That's the whole point is it you're just killing you're just shooting people like do but instead you're just like you know you're killing a lot more aliens and monsters. All right. And with the bottom one-liners. All right well Zaku we got to let you go to get some more calls but I hope you can get your hands on Duke Nukem soon and see see it's the real thing. All right. Later. Have a good one. 877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio we have another call coming in. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hey this is DJ Blaziken. Hey DJ Blaziken what's on your mind? Oh not much other than I've been listening to this whole marathon shindig since it started up and the whole music break thing is bringing me back to the old days back from the really old episodes I started listening to you guys back on your old station. Well I'm glad to hear I'm glad to hear it that's kind of the idea behind it now for those that are listening on the podcast we can't do the copyrighted music that we were playing during our little breaks here for meals and potty and all that stuff but yeah we're playing a lot of the music you know when Orange Launch Radio back when we were a station on live 365 we would play music from DDR and like of just a variety of the other music based games and some of the dance mania CDs that inspired the music song list in DDR and so forth. Yeah so of all things okay I've been a little bit on a dirty shore fanatic so I've been fist pumping throughout the whole breaks. Wow. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that about this program there's a first for everything. Hey by the way um actually just um thinking of systems that regret not buying systems that do regret buying um somehow I regret not buying a Sega Dreamcast myself because and actually you know what I also had a second system I regret not buying because I had to kick ass fighting game on it was um the N64 which it had killer instinct and the controller itself the standard controller was perfect for fighting games especially if you're in the Street Fighter because you had the six buttons you had the A, B and then the little yellow buttons the C buttons or whatever they were called something like that was perfect for Street Fighter. I have to admit I got used to Street Fighter on a Super Nintendo controller like the whole fact that some of the like punches and kicks were shoulder buttons like totally didn't bother me like I just I was able to get used to it. Did you ever remember the Capcom controller that they came out for the Super Nintendo? Oh no and I thought that was on the Genesis was the special like six button. They did it in Japan. Oh really huh. The six button controller where you held a part of it in your hand and you played with the top of your fingers and it was it was kind of uncomfortable. Yeah it sounds it. And on top of that a game I regret not buying but I've actually got to play well I now finally got to buy and own is um full caliber Dreamcast. Good stuff. I wish I had GoldenEye too because yeah I mean occasionally my friend would bring it over to the daycare occasionally and he'd be over send 64 and we'd all just sit down four player multiplayer it was just epicness and you know I never owned it it was just like god now I wish I could plop some money down on that. And now the thing about it um a game that I do regret buying wow it would have to be DDR Disney Channel edition. You must have been a real DDR completionist to get that. Yeah yeah. It's a no it's another DDR worthy of the whole um bumper old bumper from Step Squad 3. This DDR sucks. It ain't a solo. Actually solo was actually pretty good. Um and solo was awesome that was some of the best music they had in DDR ever especially solo 2000 was amazing. Just saying. Yeah I think my arcade had the solo 2000 but stupid idiots trade for pump it up. Not even the same. I want to back up real quick because you were talking about like the Dreamcast and missing out on that and everything which was the same thing I said for the system that um I kind of regret not buying but then I also think about it and it's like you know at that time in my life there was no way I could have paid that type of money for that system you know I was barely out of college there and I didn't really have a job I mean I sort of worked temp jobs in the summer and so forth. There is no way I would have been able to afford one so I regret not being able to afford it I guess but I you know I couldn't buy it. I guess I can't say I don't regret not buying one because I was able to buy you know food and you know other things but. Sorry Scott. Actually I'm contrary to the whole Dreamcast thing um the babysitter my mom sent me to a bunch of times he had like a bunch of systems to play and like six or seven arcade games like in Mortal Kombat 2, Asteroids, Snow Bros. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait how old were you when you were going to the babysitter? I was I was like six. The Manny? Seven. Okay you they were letting you play Mortal Kombat 2 at six years old? Yeah and Mortal Kombat he had he had Final Doom on the PlayStation I played that a lot actually when one of his friends would come over we'd link up the two Playstations to play uh four player Final Doom and once again FPS epicness which that's why I ended up buying um what was it I ended up buying Doom on Xbox Live and Soul Calibur. Am I the only one that's like what's wrong with this picture why is the six-year-old being allowed to play Mortal Kombat 2 and Doom when he's with the Manny like I don't get that. Hey but but the cool thing was like not only that did I play it in his house but on the occasions I'd go over to the mall and then my mom like she was searching for me so she knew I was in the arcade section of the mall at the time and this is the same mall that won't fix the ITG machine it's still down which sucks um but at the time they had a Mortal Kombat 4 arcade machine and I would play that constantly because it was only one token to play. And how old were you eight? I was 10 and actually the first game I ever got wow actually the first game system I ever got was a Game Boy a Game Boy Pocket first two games I got one with a combo game cartridge Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 and then the other was Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back which which I loved the cantina song that would play whenever the characters were bringing up dialogue. And those games those games didn't screw you up as a kid like you're fine now you have a good sense of reality you're you're stable mentally and all that good stuff. Not pretty much like my mom was like nah nah nah it's cute violence blah blah blah it will make you go crazy I'm like really and I bought GTA Liberty City Stories behind her back on Amazon for a PSP hacking point because it was used to get the hen to activate but it ended up not working as well as I thought the hack would work but I just had fun with that and just she never knew about it. Have you told your mom recently about all these things you were playing behind her back? When you were growing up? You kind of figured out after a while what I was playing but she didn't care by the time I was she was like you know as long as here's the good thing I didn't become that stupid Virginia Tech shooter or the Von Mar shooter which you probably might have heard about yeah I've heard about them and and you know I didn't go out and shoot at the high school I didn't go out with a sniper rifle and shoot a bunch of people if I felt like I wanted to deck someone in the face I waited until I got home or got on the bus started up GTA and started beating up random civilians in the game that's that was my anger management. I like what hoofhearted says in chat saying my father didn't care that I played MK but my mom got scared and said you're going to live with your auntie in Bel Air. Alright Blaze I gotta let you go so we can try and get some more calls and do more marathon but thank you for that one last thing. Yes um okay basically the PSP in and of itself is almost like a Super Nintendo controller in and of itself with a screen this was an analog stick yes and Alpha 3 Max plays fine and I go between that and Street Fighter 4 and I'm looking to get in the Evo tournament one day it'd be Daigo well good luck to you alright alright have a good rockin show we will we'll try later thanks for being a part of the marathon that's kind of a marathon phone call here in the Orange Lounge Radio marathon we can probably do one or two more big calls whatever I got nothing else to do let's see um I'm trying to look in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com which is still pretty full here um let's see what was the question oh uh Beta CNCRA was asking why is the show only on Sundays why can't it be on every day? We have this thing called lives yeah that and uh a job and this this show doesn't pay us anything in fact we actually pay to do this show uh it's you know although we don't pay very much anymore we don't have to pay for a feed anymore the fine folks at All Games Radio help subsidize that so uh but uh wait till you know I could show you the bill for our mixing board yeah hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this yeah hello there good evening uh if that's sweet who's been with you all this time good morning to you my friend so gosh when we started it was probably what like midnight where you are no it was what was it if I remember no no no it was like 11 o'clock or something well that's not too bad we've been going for seven hours now so just seven and a half oh my god seven and a half hours so do the math oh whatever all right but um what was I gonna say well um yeah um Mass Effect is uh kind of interesting almost in that sense that well finally DLC for that game will will uh show up oh for yeah because that's right Mass Effect Mass Effect 2 right has it had a lot of download content come out DLC that you actually want to buy because it well because that backstory with a shadow broker is like winner huh really nice or yeah but here and uh I and I already have actually read the comic for it uh the Mass Effect Redemption Mass Effect Redemption comic what do you think which takes place actually around that before Mass Effect around that time when um well or when it takes place like before Mass Effect 2 let me ask you about this even though it's totally not to get it not the part that you wanted to call in talk about but there was a rumor last week on the show about um that I guess Matthew Fox from Lost had been cast to be the dude in a Mass Effect movie what do you think about the possibility of a Mass Effect movie Mass Effect movie would be kind of nice in some way but well how but my problem though is that my Shepard is not male she's female Shepard is female points Shepard can be whoever you want them to be that is true that is true you know um completely not what you were asking but um I only play female characters in Warcraft because people treat you better well so do I well yeah even though the uh the ironic thing about that front is that well um I didn't get to max level at um I did I didn't get to max level that soon actually because I like every time I didn't hit max level but then I think I did at some point anyway yeah because I mostly played female characters too and what happens well I roll a troll male and I and I hit max level it's funny the characters you will get most invested in out of everything else I gotta read this comment from chat real quick uh DDR dollar says uh in our chat room this caller reminds me of when I was younger and said the avatar from Ultima was female you know yeah when I played Ultima quest for the avatar on the um NES usually like half half of the different class types you could get were females and I think usually the one I would opt to play is like the druid I think or the shepherdess and both were female so you know I I totally get that reference DDR dollars saying so just kind of funny it wasn't that I was in that case it was pre-assigned if you want to be the fighter it was the male if you want to be and in Ultima 3 was the same way like the paladin in Ultima 3 was female she had a little heart for the shield which was just very precious see a little it's cute adorable anyhow so um unfortunately I can't think of any system that I regret buying in some way because I don't get any of my system buys unfortunately what about a game I might regret is that I smashed a uh smashed two game boys oh my gosh oh my gosh I really and one of them was play and I actually know they know the two uh and the two games that I did buy whatever did play well first of it was that I smashed my original game boy while while I was playing Kirby's pinball land that game was awesome some the other time was uh when I was uh I smashed my other gameboy pocket playing uh warrior land for some strange reason those Nintendo pinball games were so freaking good though like uh the pokemon pinball was so awesome I used to play that on it I don't think I would have broke a gameboy over it but you know uh oh but here's the other thing though I have uh oh but here's the other thing though I was uh much younger at that time because I was like 12 or something when I smashed my first gameboy or something I think and you've had anger management classes since then no I haven't and well and well what is it and uh and usually I don't break stuff the only thing that I've managed to break was uh oh I heard managed to break was uh and then he cut out I think we lost the connection there that's a bummer I hope we didn't lose the whole damn internet again okay good no it's still strongly disconnected and I see the chat room going there so we're good well unfortunately we lost hockey ripper but uh anger management I want to talk about this actually let's talk about your most like angry video game moment that just made you like you you wanted to break shit or something like that angry video game moment Alan it looks like you're you're thinking of something Mike Tyson's punch out um the guy in the turban that span around and he had the little gem on his turban that sparkle when he was gonna do his move tiger something yes him he brought me to tears did you actually cried I cried so much over that guy that's awesome I couldn't beat him and it just I cried would you would you actually do the whole like crying into your pillow thing where you like you throw the controller down and jump on your bed and go no it was more it was far more heart wrenching and really I was can you describe I was utterly defeated as a person my nine ten year old self just had like these bitter tears of several people in chat thank you great tiger was his name you've you've clearly tried to block that from your mind great tiger made you cry yeah I want to like make you like a little like t-shirt or something like with this picture on a great tiger made me cry and here's the thing I actually got up to Mike Tyson in that game and I never actually beat it because he was impossible but yet I was like this is I was like this is just stupid how hard this is so then I just stopped playing to Mike Tyson but did that one boss I just cried I think I've thrown controllers like power outages have made me thrown controllers which is very frustrating I can't think of like any boss fights or anything that have really driven me to that or or cry I didn't get a drop in Wow the other day and that no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not that bad I'll do the Huffy stomp I'll do the yeah you roll like in 95 and then someone else that happened that fucking shit happened last week I knew it and you were like no it's okay and like you type to chat you're like oh it's okay congratulations I'm glad you want it but I'm like he's fucking sitting there fucking throwing a fit like these probably like pillows are getting thrown in his place right now god damn it why do we even fucking do these rooms I hope that drop was worth it when I push you down the stairs next time I see you anger management dark soccer any any moment in gaming where you've just gotten so angry you wanted to break something playing Dan and x-men versus Street Fighter I just wanted to take the controller and embed it firmly into his skull because see Dan back in the day and he's still like this to a degree but not nearly as bad as it used to be Dan likes to gloat and likes to be alpha male you know big junk you don't say and back in the day he had that problem even more and so he would kick my ass soundly until I would play cami and gambit and he would just haha haha you know he was Nelson but he would be really dickly about it and finally I'm like I'm just gonna beat you with this controller I beat Alan with my shoe last night how was it Alan I'll tell you was it hot let me tell you about this in a minute actually uh because we have a call story we have a seriously who uses a shoe all right uh caller you're on the air hi who's this I haven't derailed you guys just derailed me with the talk about their shoe this is the like third time you've called in tonight but that's okay what's on your mind yeah you must be tired of me calling all the damn time it's all right it's all good what's on your mind I guess I have an interesting Xbox Live story which in turn I end up getting two months free service out of them okay how'd this work well I always buy the cards to reload my subscription it's a rarity that I actually log in with my credit card give my information to rip me for a month or two now the last time this happened they start automatically debiting my card I'm like no don't do that and I set it to make sure that it would not do that so what I had so you know I figured I'd go back to the card you know refill one month or two they had like that one dollar special so I'm like you know what I'm going to sign up for that so I signed up for about two months of service and then I went out and got another card they get an email from saying that they were unable to bill my card because the card was invalid so I shrugged it off like no big deal you would think that they would see it in the system I automatically re-upped my account for another year every two three weeks I would get an email about that then one week in July I figured I'd jump on fire something on Netflix I go in and it says that my account is back to silver and I'm like what the hell is going on I call them up asking them why did they cancel my account and they said I did not pay for it and I'm explaining to them if you see in the system I purchased a one year card so that makes no sense so here I am screaming at the poor guy in India who in turn is like the best thing is to get you a supervisor I'm like yeah put him on I'm explaining the whole situation he's like my hands are tied there's nothing I can do at that point I just drop a nuclear bomb because I'm just beyond aggravated about all of this and he goes what what we can do to have a manager call you back within 48 hours fine here's my number call mecca 48 hours nope nothing absolutely nothing so I go online wait wait wait I'm missing okay they were set up to charge you automatically no I canceled that okay you canceled that but they tried to do it anyway yes and then you use prepaid cards yes and what were they doing were they adding it to the time in the past that you hadn't paid for where you were like I don't want to use this or I don't I'm still lost right now what it was doing the card was supposed to kick in after I paid for one month which was in April okay so my lie was supposed to go from May 2010 to May I guess May 2011 April 2011 okay but I kept getting the email saying that they were not able to build my car for my account and yet I it's it's listed that I already have a year with them oh so for some reason they're still trying to charge your card even though you put the prepaid one on right now I get it okay so the manager manager never called me back so I go on to the consumerist find like contacts from Microsoft I sent emails to Steve Ballmer and somebody else in charge at Microsoft with Xbox live nice within two days I get a call from the manager I explained everything he profuse he apologizes and goes into the system it seems that on the supervisor's end they don't have access to billing that's crazy like what's the point then you think there ought to be somebody that can fix it you know it's just weird yeah very I'm like I'm yelling at the guy log into your system and fix it oh we don't have access to that how do you not have access to you know uh gold anthro in our chat room at chat dot orange laundry dot com says it's because of shit like this that I'm just gonna stick to prepaid cards now I don't blame him but you know damn it a dollar for a month is a good deal you can't beat that that is that is a very good deal all right Rama anything else you wanna say real quick cuz we're gonna get back to angry games and beating with shoes and stuff in a minute long story short the guy contacts me back he canceled my my gold sends me a new code so now I'm good from July to like June of 2011 so I end up getting like two extra months out of the deal must be nice yeah so in the moral of the story is yelling at the supervisor fixes the trick every time I'm kidding I'm kidding don't I used to work in a call center please don't sometimes they're I know don't yell at them if they can't help you find me I'll give you an email address to somebody to take care of it for you yeah exactly all right all right Rama I'm gonna let you go for real have a good one okay buddy okay good I need more vodka all right good luck have fun all right where were we oh yes beating with shoes and Alan's like I want to tell this story yeah so Rob does not parallel park he doesn't in San Francisco near where I live parking is more precious than platinum or gold so if you see a space especially if it's a rock star space right in front of where you're going you park in it but you know if you're used to parking lots and you can't parallel park you just say fuck that and you keep going so whenever Rob under extreme duress has to parallel park I will basically tease the hell out of him for it because he usually will not try and last night when we were going to his rocky horror performance there were basically three blocks of parallel parking without cars so he just had to like drive in and sort of scoot his car up to the edge and I was like I don't know are you sure you can handle it it's parallel parking so he takes his shoe off and starts whapping me with it no no it was I said I if you better be quieter I'm gonna beat you in my shoe and then I think I like hit the curb with parking yeah see and then finally he stops the car he's like oh wait how far away from the curb am I and I'm like there's no one here like my original making fun of you still stands and then he took his shoe off and he hit me with it well you deserved it yeah you know I'm not I'm not one to advocate domestic violence but you know so yeah he gives me stink eye for making fun of his parallel parking and then he you know stops the car and we're like five feet away from the curb with no cars he didn't have to wiggle wiggle in at all no not at all yeah good times yeah I agree with brake man in our chat room fuck parallel parking I agree with that and misty says fuck driving that's your that's your attitude that's where I'm at yeah what is it about driving that you're just you're just not gonna do it the expense in you know car payment gas insurance someone gets drunk and hit you you're dead you know it's just it's awful but it's really nice like being able to go wherever you want whenever you want like that's really you don't have to rely on really anyone else just saying I had the internet at home I don't have to go anywhere what about food Amazon will ship it what about if it's like oh my god I need some pink berry right now or I'm gonna like kill somebody I went there I heard they played Abba mm-hmm amazing I had the chocolate with the the hazelnut crunch stuff on it and I wanted to die it was good I've been telling you it's amazing I love the way that place is designed it's cute very cute little place sorry to derail that's okay misty and chat says it's a combo of the expense the idiots on the road and my fail attention span long drives can be tough like sometimes I'm like oh I want to take like a really long drive like I'm gonna go drive across country or I'll drive like I'll do something crazy like go drive to Kansas and visit Shane is like halfway across the country or I'll drive up to Canada like Vancouver or something and then I'm like oh god that would be so grueling though like at the drive there is not usually the bad part it's the drive home like our Portland trip right yeah I thought we were making well we were making really good time we got through Oregon I was like this is great you know this isn't bothering me at all they don't then once we got into Reading California and realized there were still what three four hours after the drive wanted to die get me out of this car it's tough I think dark soccer has done a similar drive right haven't you driven all the way up to southern Washington we right we drove to Prosser Washington pretty much just as far I think last year we did the drive drive drive up there is great well Dan drove I slept and he would stop me on the way back for snow talking more about angry games I didn't ask Bradley this question yet I gotta see I cuz Bradley's one of those very quiet like if you can't tell he's very quiet very shy does it does not get angry I gotta ask him if he's ever gotten angry he's like I'm gonna kill this bitch wait hold on hold on I gotta say this chat comment real quick though xlink in our chat room talking about angry stuff I got upset when a certain member of my guild had won the role for the battered hilt twice and then decided to give one of them to his boyfriend that likes to beat him with his shoe yeah I love that that's your response yeah yeah that was me all right Bradley yeah well I do get very angry at games sometimes I can't remember like any specific really really big incidents I know throwing controllers all the time I was a kid good thing about Genesis controllers is they're there you can always fix them pretty much like Saturn controller there that I think that the round controller that wasn't Saturn was it and there's one of them has the the shoulder button has like a magnet if you hit it wrong it'll detach the magnet and you can't if you can't because it works with a magnet somehow and so if it's not attached in the right place it won't work so that for that and then I know last week when I was playing burnout revenge anytime was I screwing up a bunch out yeah that would go screaming going oh fuck you god damn it it's so funny how Nintendo like puts out this like very family-friendly system you know and it's like oh you know oh we have to use friend codes so that children don't hear naughty language and did it up but I remember back in the day in college playing Super Mario Kart in the dorms and we would say the filthiest shit while playing that game like you know talking about each other our mothers you know the sex stuff and just all this stuff while playing you know Mario Kart it got ugly very ugly but it's not my fault I whoop them all with toad because he's the best yes those are cars you will drive go-karts right in faith would you would you drive like a real go-kart I'm 6'5 can I fit in when we go to Disneyland will you ride Autotopia sure oh my god then I could take a picture of you driving and be all like he is great and be all like hell froze over lol yeah you're like this isn't funny I want to change the topic let's see break man in chat says long drives are fine as long as your wife or girlfriend sleeps lol well my girlfriend just keeps telling me how bad of a driver I am bitch I know I'm a bad driver close your eyes you won't notice nice oh hey the phone's ringing why don't we answer it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's on your mind to say oh um actually uh I was hoping to talk about infamous too well okay what's up what do you think of infamous to tell us a little bit about it for those that don't know what infamous is all about uh well I haven't actually played the game so I don't really know a whole lot about the story but uh apparently um some world ending between a warbird disaster strikes and hero appears by the name of coal and he has electrical powers now what I want to talk about the second one is um how are they going to integrate the uh um ice abilities into the uh gameplay mechanics because from what I played on the um um sorry from what I played on the demo for the first one um everything just kind of melded together for the electrical abilities so I'm just wondering how that would work unfortunately it's not a series I'm on the up and up on Loki's kind of the expert about those and he's not here so uh I don't know is infamous a series you've read up on at all Alan Jamie anybody I don't know much about this I bought it but I haven't played it oh really well at least somebody has used it series infamous oh um no we're so informed here at orange lounge radio that's awesome well we don't have time to play everything I'm sorry so we can't play anything right now because Dan's playing the game that shan't that shan't be named I know they've been playing that all night I was thinking about playing sims as long as we have been doing this marathon they have been playing the game we can't name what again shall not be named what you can't name it like if we could tell you that we would name it but it's the game that shall not be named it's violent yes is there a reason why it's uh because it's not out yet Beyonce wrote a song about it and now she owns the copyright oh okay he's playing imagine single lady yes all right all right we're gonna let you go and say oh I'm sorry we couldn't really um answer your question we fail but um hey let us know about the game when you uh actually pick it up all right all right good luck buddy at least I got to make a Beyonce joke on that call all right uh oh uh let's see um some folks in chat are like can I come over I didn't wait I didn't tell you what we were playing I don't know nothing I don't know nothing you savages you guys it's been about an hour you guys want to take a quick break here take a stretch I want to get more water okay we're gonna take a potty stretch break come back uh we got some more topics we got through facebook twitter topics galore we still have to do rob you you have to do the theme what theme the pala pala parapara oh I didn't have time to set it up I'm sorry I forgot I've just put everything on shuffle so maybe you'll get the I know you like this song we'll do it we'll do this song okay you'll like this and so uh we'll be back with more of the orange launch radio marathon as we enter into hour eight in just a moment we'll be back with more of the orange launch radio marathon your tweets so forth and so on welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on this sunday evening it is episode number 380 of our show a very long episode of that september the 5th 2010 where we are entering hour 8 of our marathon we started at 2 and it's now 10 can't believe it all right and it probably doesn't turn out that long in the podcast because we have been taking musical breaks which some people might consider cheating but you know what we got to go to the bathroom at some point we got to eat we got to you know just get up and stretch this room gets kind of stuffy too so you know that's just how it works if you don't like it too bad the show's free for god's sake stop complaining about free things you suck all right i should say though um if you want to support free things you can always like leave us a nice review on itunes or tell a couple people about the show you know that's what we always ask just tell some friends and all that good stuff that's all we want all right um chat's asking about chat fus can we do some chat if use are we gonna read some of those sure um go ahead and send them and i'll read them in about 30 minutes sound good okay so send in your uh fus over private message to dark sakura and she'll do chat fus and that's a first for the podcast feed we don't have to do those in the podcast feed but just for you guys because we love you we'll do them tonight how's that sound works for me all right awesome meanwhile twitter we uh we never got around to uh doing the tweets that were sent us in the last uh segment because i asked for some tweets and we got on tangents talking about angry games and and the callers that we had and all that good stuff so uh i'm gonna try to get to some tweets but i don't have the twitter music i can't do tweets without the twitter music oh my gosh it's all i ruined everything we have to stop the marathon it's done nose i'm kidding yeah when you were out getting pizza i deleted all of the native olr music files they're gone you jerk all right i found it phew we love our twitter oh uh to care a saying uh how is the final fantasy 14 beta isn't it just a prettier ff11 yeah pretty much it's ff11 with different combat and this whole guild left thing that makes no sense to me whatsoever the biggest problem with final fantasy 11 is that it doesn't hand hold you at all and like i i agree some games overdo it with the hand holding but what was the most frustrating thing about final fantasy 11 the fact that it just plunked you in the middle of a town and was like decay by the people yeah um so final fantasy 14 is it's the beta is really crowded i couldn't figure out what to do like i couldn't figure out that there was like a whole nother map level i was supposed to go to and like activate a switch like you would think the game would lead you through the first couple quests just to kind of like give you a tutorial like you know about how the game works the interface you know maybe it's because it's a beta not all of that's built in yet but i just the beta left me feeling very frustrated and that's why i'm kind of laughing at all this like closed betas or the open beta stuff going on is i'm like guys it's not worth your time okay but hey it's a free game and at least you'll know if you can uh buy it when it comes out or not but i honestly think the game is going to tank i think it's going to tank bad especially for a final fantasy game like i think they're expecting it to do really well it's not going to do nearly the business 13 did but we'll see um dj blaiskin said of several tweets and usually i limit people to two tweets but hey it's the marathon why not so dj blaiskin says what's cuter than a cat playing duck hunt nothing and sends us this uh tweet or sorry an article via twitter and i actually did see this it's a video on youtube of a kitty who's actually playing duck hunt and they start the game there and then the kid this is terrible radio but i don't care and the cat see the cat's like scratching the dog with her paws and oh i'm going for the next like attacking the ducks even though they fly off screen it's adorable tell me that's not adorable it's adorable cats are so damn cute uh let's see dj blaiskin says don't bother watching football this season madden 11 already picked all the winners and lead us to a news story about how i guess uh all the winners are already uh it's been determined because you know there's all the statistics in madden and everything um the ravens and packers will be the conference winners so there it is so i just i lol super bowl spoilers i think the football star that actually is on the cover of madden has the madden curse so like if you're the guy who's on the box the box art they have a horrible season after the game comes out i think that's like a thing i don't know i don't follow it is i've heard that i've heard the same thing they always get injured or something happens yeah who was on the cover this year i wasn't paying attention was it brett farve people like him tiger woods david beckham that's football right yes that's right it's david beckham it is all right um let's see dj blaiskin sent us a story that we talked about in the very first hour of the marathon so i'm just gonna assume you didn't hear it about microsoft raising the price of xbox live gold we'll just pretend i didn't get that tweet um apparently super scribble knots is um there there's an announcement about super scribble knots or whatever i don't know uh redertainment is linking us to this story on twitter at mega 64 i guess they're excited because they're in the game i don't they're actually in the game i guess good for them i don't whoopty shit i mean whatever i got it i met them once at e3 a couple of them i don't know who it was that i met because i had no idea who they were and they were really offended that i didn't know who they were like we didn't know who they were and they were like offended and i'm like get over yourself like you have some lulzy video game blog on the internet like oh my god your dick is so powerful you know it's like god do you know who i am no i don't expect people to know who i am but yay to them getting in a game i guess whatever i guess now i i won't be able to get away from it i'll have to know who they are it was i don't know if i should say this because this is get back to i won't i won't go into it any further allegedly uh all right the word allegedly will always say oh come on this is an alleged story it's all allegedly i allegedly it was a large man with glasses that's all i'm going to say all right but i think that's all of them isn't it like i think i think in that video they were all large men with glasses weren't they i don't think that tells you anything large men in it and software development you've really yeah i know i know like a unicorn all right but yay for super scribble knots i think that's great i uh sony is going to be rolling out a rival to uh itunes apparently didn't loki bring this up earlier in the show i think he did yeah it's getting to that point in the marathon where we're not sure if we've talked about things already or not so we're kind of like talking about him again but uh yeah apparently sony is going to be uh doing a competitor to itunes and i really want to say loki talked about that earlier in the show but hey we'll we'll just mention that we have a shout out just for you entertainment shout out whoo all right uh let's see moving on dark tetsuya says i know this is a more local question but will the golf land slash dave and buster meetup still happen sometime soon they've been happening yeah um well there wasn't one this past week well no because dan and i were saving money and time for our anniversary but they've they've been happening history will repeat itself that's it yes it'll happen again of course um let's see uh jeju go on chat says uh how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood possible impromptu listless question mark we do need to do a listless at some point before the marathon's over so the next break we write up stuff yeah we'll we'll write that in a match game during the next break and then we'll have something to play for real so that'll be cool uh let's see a mae satsuma says what kind of pre-order bonus do you want to see in duke nukem forever i want to see a duke nukem forever urinal cake i think that would be uh quite quite classy don't you think that would be very classy i know i think it's classy anybody here in studio what kind of pre-order bonus do you want to see for duke nukem forever how about duke nukem forever pasties for your stripper friends that'd be good right be good anybody i want the stripper pole you want the stripper pole i want the pole and a gun huh alan anything i don't know nice all right uh let's see other tweets at olr breakman says uh on twitter what are the olr drinking games what are the rules can the chatters play together i use any excuse yeah drink anytime one of us says um you'll be floored in like a minute no uh oopsie drink uh i think there is a drinking game compiled on the orange lounge radio wiki which is orange lounge radio dot wikia.com i want to say there is a drinking game compiled there so then it combines some stuff with under sedation live um if you listen to that show although i don't know i i'm looking at twitter and there's a tweet from travis earlier uh six hours ago so that was during the main show

this question uh and of course our facebook page facebook.com slash orange lounge radio what is your favorite video game of all time such a simple question that i don't know if it's been discussed here on the show yet tonight guardian legend why you can't just say a name it's a chick that turned into a plane and she shoots stuff and she fights giant eyeball creatures and tentacle monsters and then the little the little freaking ball people from uh the adventure of lolo are in it the end well said tgl bitches guardian legend bradley what is your favorite video game of all time her um you can't pick two you're a cheater no okay fine you can pick two maniac mansion okay why valkyrie profile because your mom i don't know don't give me that look like i don't need a reason bitch like there's got to be something about the game that you like right the art the music the story the unmatched combat no rpg is ever really done what was the combat in valkyrie profile for those that don't know um it was a weird hybrid of uh active time battle and um real time all right i had really insane combos in it like street fighter why maniac mansion because it's iconic and it was the first game that really brought um comedy into adventure gaming and it had a modern setting as teenagers in present day whereas all adventure games up till then was like adventure or sci-fi you know and they had the saturday morning show like later on didn't it when they're like a saturday morning maniac mansion show or something i barely remember that i think you're right though i'm almost positive there was did you actually play that through to completion is it is it true you can beat it with every combination of characters or no you can't can't do it with all of them there are hmm i know that there are two or three characters that it's really preferred that you have at least one of them in there but yeah i think you can beat it with all with any three wait here you go here you go look at this blast in the past this is live action yeah it was a live action show tv show oh my gosh i remember that it was like almost like a drama the way the credits make it look like huh let's see let me see if i can go oh it's created by eugene levee really let's see wait there's a i think it ran for like three episodes before they pulled the plug on it you can't underestimate these fly instincts you know jesus has to look at me with those big baby blacks i can't fly for a minute if you know what i mean this is like a scene out of twin peaks or something there she is this is creepy i don't like this all right yeah this is upsetting is it ruining your memory of the show or is it ruining your memory of the game is it making you like it has nothing to do with the game so all right yeah but it said in the credits based on the lucas film game just so you know you look like you're about to beat me with that microphone it's all right all right um hey save it for when you get home my favorite video game oh promise my favorite video game of all time and if you don't already know this you haven't been listening to the show uh super metroid is my favorite video game of all time it was even mentioned during this show it was bob grabbed my copy earlier in the show it's great i love it and yet i haven't bought metroid other m because i am afraid it's terrible like i just i have been i've heard from people it's great i've been hearing mixed things on it and i'm very worried and i have to hook up my we to play it i don't want to look at the solution netflix what or gamefly or whatever oh game i was like netflix you can get games to netflix too yeah i could do the net or the netfly the gamefly thing but that would involve me again getting the motivation to hook up the weed my tv and that means you know rob it takes 10 freaking minutes not my house you've had a gamefly account since like march that's been rotting yeah i don't i don't really ever use it it's kind of sad i don't know is it worth it should i play metroid other m if i'm such a stand for super metroid chat vote yn let's see break man says watch fng friday night gaming or effing live it's it's effing live uh bobby's gonna show metroid other m i do i maybe i'll check that out we'll see i might all right um we'll see uh bradley times up do you think of something i think i'd probably go with a panther dragoon saga it's a just a really epic game and so one one game when the first time i saw the battle system i got whoa that's awesome just because it's just a different system and seeing that you fly upside you're flying right next to the enemies that you're fighting it's like well this is really really really neat because you're flying around them in a circle uh and then you and then you attack based on that yeah so and then just a really cool storyline that and lots like uh lots of things to explore and uh neat things never played it sadly i think i've played all the other games that have been mentioned but i've never played that for some sick reason i'm just not cool yeah well it was only a limited edition and all that kind of stuff it's definitely worth applying i wanted to say that only 6,000 copies were printed in the us when it came out something like wow no wonder it's so expensive let's see some folks in chat about uh metroid other m yes yes yes why why but then i got a private message that says it sucks so maybe the people who think it sucks don't want to speak up frisbee says at least try it oh there's me glatov saying no uh hey we got last minute if you rama says

funny thing about this video and why you people are laughing at it because if you've ever been to play dnd this is it yeah it really is like this are you a dnd player alan no never have you never played dnd i bought the rule book the kit when i was in sixth or seventh grade but i just read it i never actually had any friends to play getting a call getting home hi you're on orange radio who's this this is silent nathan hey nathan how are you got any cheetos you got any mountain dew hold on we'll get back to the funny in a minute but nathan nathan started this whole stupid dnd conversation in the first place so you're you're you're a dnd nerd right nathan yeah and you still play dnd right you are the dungeon master right okay i'm the i'm the i'm the gatekeeper are you the key master no no he's a dungeon master and you're you're the cavalier all right all right so you you wanted to talk about me playing dungeons and dragons so what was it like to have me as your player in dungeons and dragons you you do remember the orc panty seller right vaguely yes yes i do actually yes i do you guys wanted to buy your fancy lingerie because all you dudes and women's were playing women characters and they needed fancy lingerie hey it's important this is fantastic keep going i want to hear more please well did rob roll his charisma check the the normal go down kill rats in the basement they had to fight undead chickens i right now i remember that quest i actually distinctly that was like one of the first i think it was like the first or second night we ever played we did the engine and dead chickens in the basement but i have to know did rob make his charisma rolls did he save or fail all right stop let let the man talk dark soccer so um are you guys playing dnd right now are you in a dnd thing right now uh we were supposed to play yesterday but we couldn't oh i'm sorry to hear that i just i hear a lot of commotion in the background so i was wondering if you were playing dnd right now or what's going on or if you're in your own panty cellar i don't know i don't know i don't know your own panty cellar i don't know so no that's uh panda lady's uh sister is here visiting oh say hello tell tell what we said hello and send our love from olr um uh what was i gonna ask princess or what i hear yes rice princess say hello and you know all that um what was i gonna say about uh oh yes uh how was it having me in your game because alan really likes to hear stories about how terrible my ex was so how was it having me in the game versus having my ex in the game allegedly um it it took extra time he slowed things down you your very first quest you were in a basement with shells and he decided that he wanted to climb these shelves to get a better look at the surroundings of the basement and i can see that happening once but he tried it at least three times one of which he rolled a natural one and knocked over the shelf which is just like real life allegedly allegedly this is fantastic oh yeah he he he was interesting um he was special yes but he's not here anymore that's the important thing right no he kept thinking that the cleric was a priest and he kept trying to cast his wow spells in dnd cast smite smite no he's he went i want the bubble a casa bubble i want casa bubble nathan's laughing because he knows i'm telling the truth you're not exaggerating good times good times well where where i sadly i'm not playing dnd with you guys anymore because you know i i travel to the bay pretty much every weekend when you guys play but um what what kind of adventures do you do in dnd now um right now they're not too ridiculous um but there was a big asshole who everyone kind of hates who's the big hero of the town his name's larbio and he's modeled after fabio only more sexual harassment involved does his hair have its own saving throw hey what does his hair have its own saving throw no but he did have commercials for a fancy type of butter it was i can't believe it's not butter light and the thing about that was it glowed in the dark that's that's fantastic i i your game's totally rock yeah i know all right um yeah i you know one of these days nathan i'm gonna have to drop in and make a cameo if i could find my old character sheet although to be honest i think it's long gone i think it's like in that box of like things that remind me of the x that got shredded like you know when i left so sadly i don't know if i have it anymore but i'll have to make a cameo at some point in your game it'll be fun every once in a while we've done some drunk dnd nights we've done two of those yeah so far and uh eddie has actually come to those so and one time we played the campaign module that the guys from penny arcade had made i was making fun of the twilight movies very nice very nice so uh yeah you're more than welcome to stop by uh that would be a perfect time because we don't do any big campaign it's just something stupid we get drunk and laugh and i i will absolutely do that and i'll cast bubble can i cast bubble no no not not wow and that's exactly how nathan would have to respond to like like trying to bite his tongue like you could sense he just wants to jump over the table and be like you're fucking ruining my fucking game you little shit like you just said no you can't you can't you can't do that this is this is dnd you not wow it's not no no all right all right nathan thank you so much for calling in and good luck with the dnd okay no problem you have a good time with the rest of your hour oh we will

seven game olr oh see i was good about one eight six six and i think i got the other two things right and i was like wait that could be wrong i might get like you know a porn line or something yeah it's eight seven seven just just for the future just just so you know all right well um i'm calling you because you were telling me about a bunch of cool stuff you saw this past week so where were you what was going on i don't know what you can and can't say what where were you at what were you doing what's cool i was at the game stop man just conference in awesome but not san antonio is there and what's awesome in san antonio anyone the alamo all right did you go to the alamo no i'm not a tourist i don't care about that stuff you think i don't even know what the alamo is because i think people died there or something but can you say tortilla tortilla sorry just quoting one of my favorite movies of all time uh anyhow so what was that showgirls no that's a different movie that was that was um pewie's big adventure yes which with jan hooks were you where you can totally see the the fake lights being pulled towards the the car thing oh i think they um played a clip of that at our conference because it was like he was in a phone booth and somebody was asking where he was at and then he like had all these people that were randomly walking by him they all said san antonio or something because they were nice or i don't remember again i don't pay attention the stars at night shine big and bright did you try doing that because if i ever go to texas again that's the first thing i'm going to do especially if i go to visit travis i'm going to like make him take me out somewhere in public and do that and then i'll say the stars at night shine big and see what happens and hopefully it'll be just like that so i don't think it will if i end in like rape or shooting am i hey dan how are you doing the first time i went to whoa that's loud the first time i went to a manager's conference in texas that was exactly the first thing i did was it i called i called mystique it was like hey i'm in texas listen i'll prove it and the people playing along it was amazing nice well you i'm sorry you didn't get to go to the conference this year dan well i haven't gone to a game stop conference for a while i'm messing i know i know yes i'm i'm sorry i did too i was like uh all right so tell us i don't i don't know what you can or can't tell us about the conference shane but tell us about your experience there at the conference oh let's see well i'll start off with some highs uh the very first thing that we had to see were broken the groups so we had to go to different vendors the very first thing we saw in my group was a like a trailer of tons of different fatalities from the new moral combat game and they were hilarious and any that you remember what any that you remember oh yeah um there was one where reptile threw up in somebody's mouth like a whole bunch of acid that was funny pick us up like that once actually there was one where sector like blew up somebody's torso and like a few different pieces and as the pieces were flying at the air he locked onto each individual piece and shot missiles at them so made them explode even more okay um there was one where there was one where squirt can cut like i don't feel like right through the guy at the waistline and he didn't fall over anything and then he cut the guy through the neck all the way through and then he like kicked the torso so just the torso flew and then the head flew up and he took his little knife and sliced the head in half i was like oh that's hilarious this is sounding like a song what were the stage the stage ones did you see any of those no they didn't show any stage ones but they did show um in the new uh acid pit place or old acid pit place i guess you would call it um one of the background dudes that was hanging like you saw him get dipped into the acid he was like screaming and freaking out and then they pulled him back up and he wasn't a skeleton he was like this fleshy dead like dripping thing it was awesome that's fantastic rose was it like the mortal kombat 2 um acid pit yeah yeah nice oh i want this game that that sounds hot they also i don't know if this has come out yet but i don't care um because yeah they had tag team like uh combo things like they do in like the marvel vs capcom game so you could be beating somebody up and then tag in another partner and they'll jump right in oh wow yeah it was crazy cool that's interesting so they stole that from uh marvel vs capcom it sounds like it's awesome yeah and i don't know if any other games did it before but probably not um let's see what else was cool there uh not a lot um no that was the coolest thing i think i saw which is kind of sad um i did get to play Diablo 3 um i didn't know how to play it i tried to play it like wow and that got me killed pretty quick and i was just like okay i'm done i give up it's cool i need to play it i understand that i'm terrible at it and i won't buy it you're not gonna buy it diablo is awesome it's better than i i like it better than starcraft i'm gonna get my i'm not buying for starcraft either but if they give me a wild pet maybe and i'll get it well what have you been doing because i i know you were able to get into the cata beta as well um what have you been doing in the cata beta um i have played a warden up to 12 almost and then a goblin up to four because that's where the quest is currently broken we can't proceed so the organs you know pretty cool the game doesn't feel like wow i'll say that right now it does not feel like the same game we've been playing for so many years um just going through the wargon and goblin experience but the wargons all depressing you know we gotta save our home from these attacks oh my god we're gonna die and god was like let me get some like bling glasses and i got running over people with my car and it's the best love the goblin area so so much wasn't that the entire time wasn't that working quest with the barrels uh on the abomination's heads like the best thing ever though i didn't know what to do at first i was like i'm really close to this guy why am i not throwing the barrel no you have to like get right up next to him but yeah that was pretty funny and i laughed at that stuff too it was awesome um i'm gonna do a spoiler for the the wargon quest line uh you know whatever sure um because it was there's a fun glitch that happened there's a part where you're fighting sylvanas and uh like you're like the whole town is fighting sylvanas and she knocks you back and she's about to shoot uh again graymane the leader of the wargon people uh with this poison arrow i guess but instead his son jumps in front to take the arrow but when i played she was facing the opposite direction so she shot like facing to the screen's left and the prince was right behind her but it still killed and i was like that just ruins the mood interesting did you see the um part in the wargon quest line where it's like we're gonna insert a movie here of you getting transformed into a wargon or one of the characters says that i didn't see that part i just i just skipped over it i think scroll back up a few times it's funny it's in the church yeah it's it's right and when you transform when you go from the church to when you're in the gallows thing not to ruin it but i did so oh yeah yeah i think there was one there but i didn't see anything on screen telling me that something was going to happen i just i knew it was going to happen but no no yeah i don't really care about my work immediately as much as i don't care about the goblin now because goblin is so funny like the music is all like i don't know whimsical when you play it's a goblin and your radio that goes only to uh 11. but yeah i like it it's it's not wow what we're used to but it's it's neat it's the evolution of the game all right you haven't checked out any of the new areas yet because that's what i'm waiting to do like i want my stupid character to copy over so i can check out the new areas i i still can't get my character to copy over um i'm just i'm at dark shore now i think that's why i'm at um so i'll get to see that area redone but no no character copying over it's been keeping me a little sad no i was having the same problem what can you do all right well uh if anyone here in the studio have questions for shane if not i'm gonna let him go and uh we're gonna get back to our show sound good all right get back to our marathon marathoning all right well any last thoughts for our listeners shane um yes uh you know like a month ago i wouldn't have ever said this but i think i'm a huge microsoft down boy now why because of all the free stuff they threw at us at conference and f you the sony and nintendo for not trying to win our affection by giving us lots of free stuff so your loyalty can be bought yes so if i pay you like 20 you'll wear like an orange lounge radio sticker to work uh i'll wear a sticker yeah like can i wear stickers will you wear a shirt no i can't wear a shirt that says orange lounge tour fail um but i'll pretend and i'll still take the twenty dollars that's all right we're letting you go you're useless to me without being able to promote all right take care all right you too bye all right thank you shane for being on appreciate the phone calls good times um let's see which would i never played the rest of this um uh dungeons and dragons thing so should i finish this even though like yes food is gone or start it over start it over why not all right why not why dungeons and dragons satan's game your children like it or not are attracted in their weaker

pull-up i actually you know funny enough nathan thinks that he popped my dnd cherry but that's not true i actually played in high school with some friends of mine like i hadn't played in years and years after that but you know there was there was a little group of us in high school that used to play and it was fun like one of my friends was really into it like he would talk about the campaign like at times it like wasn't appropriate like you know it's like you know there's real life and then there's campaigns so it's like us and wow basically really i really is yeah at the bar yeah yeah we'll be at the bar and it's like you know this is my favorite like when we go to the bar and let's say it's like me you and since i know they're listening like ben jim and victoria and then like who else that like plays wow might go to the bar with us um i don't know but like you me and ben will start talking about wow like oh yeah there was that raid yesterday and oh man the the fight and da da da off we'd only done this differently and you can like see jim and victoria looking at each other like how far away are we from the bar good times and what are we gonna do as soon as we get back to your place probably well we gotta run the daily that's why yeah this marathon has to be over before 3 a.m when the freaking servers reset 4 4 a.m is it for oh my god i'm kidding i'm kidding god i missed that we missed the daily yesterday friday two days didn't kill us we didn't do a daily that's right we'll be okay so you owe me two frosts i'm very upset well the ice okay okay kids i told alan i'm like alan um i you might want to mark yourself tentative for the raid monday because i don't know if we're going to be able to run because you're going to be visiting me and you know we might go out for labor day yeah we might go out because labor day you know i have the day off and alan's like well why did you schedule a raid on labor day and you know everybody's going to come and they're not going to have progression if you guys don't if we don't both come so i can play on your laptop and i don't understand like why are we like i'm going to be there and you're going to be there and we can be at home and raid one of you can use my computer i still have it installed don't encourage him it's okay to take a day off once in a while i'm just helping you should be saying oh actually i think i come to dinner with me let me get you outside the house at eight o'clock let's get ice cream tomorrow yeah we'll go very happy before eight let's go to pinkberry no here's the thing i'm gonna tell alan we will go to pinkberry tomorrow but we're only gonna go to pinkberry at 750. that's the only time we can go to pinkberry otherwise pinkberry's closed the rest of the day for inventory it's fine i'm just playing along but no i know i know let's see uh jv mondenchat says i was gonna play wow with my boyfriend but then he dumped me debbie downer no but you know what the couple the games together stays together or at least appreciates each other's nerdom like i've dated guys in the past you know and i've taught i've talked about this in the past on the show is that part of the difficulty of being gay sometimes is that most gay guys you meet are like let's talk about fashion let's talk about madonna or oh my god lady gaga you know all this stuff and you know it's just like i'm not like you know i like lady gaga i guess but as far as like all that other stuff like i'm not like into that just play classes with different armor classes so you don't have to roll against the same loot and you have will have a happy relationship clothie and a plate never have to roll on the same loot you'll be together for years hold on we're getting a call this is oh damn it i just missed

what are you guys reading they're doing icc the second half they're trying to do progression so if you're in greens and blues i don't know if that's a good idea but you can still take me we we took somebody in greens and blues last week i don't see why we wouldn't do it again you need to talk to tim all right whatever sure yeah okay what's his uh radio show calling it's i can make a joke here but i don't want to out what he does so i better not all right um you have a good one shane go raid bye you better be doing his daily every day all right okay i spent my points now i'm logging out i'm a rear admiral rob that's funny career admiral uh let's see uh anonymous 123 in our chat room says when you hear wow talk and you've never played you wish you could understand when you play or haven't played wow and you understand wow talk you wish you didn't understand define this is a good good question define what a raid is for our listeners alan a raid is content and challenges in the game that you need to coordinate a large number of players to cooperate in defeating those challenges and the rewards that you get are superior because of the people involved that good it's basically dnd for reals all right we're getting more phone calls let's i didn't even ask for calls it's just the phone is now ringing hi you're on orange on the radio who's this dj blaziken again what's on your mind dj blaziken oh not much just touching around virtual liberty city in gta balladegate tony now finally getting past that stupid chopper mission but um okay i don't know has anyone here played uh metal gear by chance no none of us in here have played oh no the truck have started to move the truck have started to move what are you talking to old school see the only metal gear language i speak is old school it's old school it's old school it's old school it's old school see the only metal gear language i speak is old school metal gear on the nes oh okay you guys played the playstation one no no no no no no no no no no those are good games too don't get me wrong metal gear solid is a solid series but you gotta go back let's see where it all began basically i'm stuck on the cycle mantis battle and that was the best battle made me almost want to crack my psp in half as we speak i see you are a careful man you save often you yeah you have to i don't know if it does this on the psp but it was so hardcore like that guy would read your memory card and like if you played other konami games he would freaking know and he'd be like yes oh you like to play castlevania do you and you'd be like oh my god oh my god because i have a castlevania save on there and a ddr save on there just for random point and let's just say here yeah you've read that and you're like rhythm fan or something around those lines but um on top of also anger management and gaming um and everything that almost made me want to break all my controllers and or system is guitar hero 3 the freaking devil i lost so many times on hard an expert to that guy what was that song guitar hero 3 ready to pete counten my guitar um i i that song in guitar hero 3 that used to kill me was uh the muse song the night knights of sedonia like i probably broke my uh i probably like broke my guitar over that i don't know how many times oh my god but that's an epic song in itself it is a pretty epic song all right we gotta let you go please hurry up hurry up what's your last thought um oh god no oh right um i tried well the work effort tried to activate like a trial account and it won't work why not i got a little trial desk and everything it won't work what would you do oh wow and everything won't log me in it's stupid call blizzard technical support the trial accounts are so crippled because of people spammers use trial accounts so they can spam without having to pay so the accounts are so crippled like when i played with a trial account like two years ago i hated it because i couldn't do anything and then when i actually paid for it it's like oh this is a completely different game so is it worth it for the 15 bucks because i was in here in a whole lot i've known for your show but from every single last one of my friends who has it been bragging all about oh i got level 80 blah blah blah and i've rolled this character why aren't you playing i'm like uh i got a life and i play other games other than just one i can't can i say this here real quickly about warcraft the reason why i play so much warcraft is because the social element uh and you know a lot of my friends play and it's it's so much fun to like raid with them and stuff and it's always fun to like meet new people too that are that are like you and stuff first off two things apparently this has suddenly turned into the robin allen guild radio show because one of the guild members who i've never seen join chat before joined and said what do you mean allen has the best dps our bro joined and finally figured out because i've been watching the guild the whole web series and i've finally figured out the whole and some of the episodes and some of the lingo the thing is she really did play wow and that's why i like that series is so spot on because i'm sure it's a lot like some of it is probably like you know obviously fiction like some of the weird dating storylines to get into but a lot of the stuff they talk about in game is so true and then i just i just got yourself in the south park make laws not warcraft episode ma'am bathroom and this is uh i just got a screenshot from one of the guild members who apparently yes in guild chat at uh at 1 56 a.m i'm assuming that's eastern time uh one of the guildies said that bitch ain't coming to raid tomorrow because he's going to get pink berry that fat bitch i just got a screenshot of somebody talking shit about me and guild wow rob if it's one i know i know they're they're listening to if it's one something that would be central time actually one of my girlfriends ended up breaking up with me via wi-fi connection on a live metroid time hunters game where we could do voice chat we had friend codes everyone in the whole room heard it and then my character died i was just like wow um worst breakup ever i uh i whatever happened like a phone call like like text messages break up how how okay you have to explain that better like what what what did she do she she just came on the vo ip or whatever was like um i you know i i want to kill you a couple more times in metroid and by the way i hate you and i don't want to see you again basically it was because i was a gamer and so she she said she said either you quit gaming or i dumped you and get this this girl was a cheerleader and freshman and i was kind of done with my life trying to find love well you know what if i had the hot shirt cheerleaders you know what if there's one lesson we could teach you here on orange lingerie to look i want i want all the young men to listen up because i know we have you know some some strapping young lads that are what between like 16 and 21 that listen to the show young guys trying to like find the girl their dreams and so forth this is what i want to teach you and jay be back me up on this is that if a woman is going to break up with you because you play too many games she's a bitch yes she's a bitch and you can do better and that's just i'm dating a girl who knows more about anime than i do there you go well she's just a nerd but that's okay nerds are okay all right all right buddy we're gonna let you go have a good one buddy all right later there's one thing you could learn from orange lounge real it's i i'm not saying if a girl doesn't play games she's a bitch that's that's that but if a girl doesn't understand you gotta respect the games she's a bitch i'm gonna get so much hate mail all right well i think i don't know if it's like honey get the keys the baby's coming now and it's like mister gut is at 20 percent the baby is harshing my mela right good news everybody the baby is coming hi on orange lounge radio who's this wait wait let me hear this straight did you say raid or rave because i got my glow sticks here ready for tomorrow night why not both let's let's rave during the raid why not why switch right have you been trying to call us for 30 minutes just to make that joke no but it's not like you said radio race i had to call it just just to say something about it raid r a i d use it to kill insects i i know i know but i just couldn't resist raid right why not all right all right bye bye he's been calling for like 30

find out we'll be back after this break here at all games right now hi and now we're back everybody welcome back to orange lounge radio on hour nine of our marathon episode we started at two o'clock today and it's now 11 16 yes we are taping here live at all games radio www.allgames.com uh sorry for the live listeners you won't hear this on podcast but we had some weird that transition thing like played three times when it shouldn't have so i apologize for that but we're trying to get set up here in studio and stuff uh we remember we're gonna do game shows we we still need to do match game and we need to do listless and all that good stuff so we're gonna do those this break where did bradley go he go out to main room we were in one hand i don't know but i totally love that screen capture oh did you get the oh did that's the best ever okay he's he's watching the game that shall not be named oh okay sounds good he'll be back he'll be back okay good uh we'll get that's why dan's not in here he's ignoring us in favor of video games that's fine yeah we asked dan to come play match game but he's like i'm in the middle of a game all right how about more uh facebook questions from earlier that uh let's do it rob and you know what i feel energetic do you i feel like we could go longer don't push it don't push i've been up i got six hours sleep last night i've been up since i'll make you some coffee sweetie uh we got 14 hours sleep i'll make you i'll make you i'll make and two naps my delicious ghetto mocha what's a ghetto mocha it's me well i made mine with decaf but decaf sauce caffeine in it except to make it kind of strong with a good scoop of a hershey's cocoa in it and then i add some splenda and uh back about a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and use a soy creamer after i add the water this actually tastes like sort of intermediate chocolate sounds so hippie it's really good all right i'll take over for it do you want some uh maybe later we'll see how i'm not tired yet but give me about another hour we'll see how we do all right uh i say we beat 12 o'clock well we're good we only got 45 minutes to go we'll probably beat it hi bradley play some more para we're going to be doing uh listless it's cheating though if i play too much music like playing about 10 minutes every hour that's that's okay because we needed to be able to take breaks and stuff but if i play much more than that we're cheating all right uh bradley hi we're going to be doing a listless here shortly tonight's topic if you want to start thinking about this and i know bradley's gonna want to think about this he needs to get his list together okay um would be uh the topic tonight thing i most want to see in the olr olr marathon 2011 okay it's going to be the topic tonight so start thinking about that get your list down okay thing i most want to see in the olr marathon 2011 all right um meanwhile more facebook questions that we uh got earlier this week um we had liam earlier ask us what is our favorite video game of all time what about this uh john on facebook asked a very similar question not just what is the best video game ever what is the worst video game ever is there a game that you can think of that would qualify as the worst video game ever dark soccer there was a game that was so bad that when dan and i rented it we were horrified by it and called blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back and it was wcw thunder that bad huh it was really that bad and you know i actually kind of thought the spice girls game was bad but it's so hilarious it was hilarious come on kind of hard to play it was awesome and the american blue stinger was bad the japanese one was cool all right worst game ever alan you got something um probably that king's quest mask of eternity game because i bought it the day it came out for full retail prize which was like 50 bucks and it is hideously awful bad terra bad terra bad um i would uh what is the worst video game ever fusion frenzy 2 is probably the worst video game one of them it's close uh that was that one i made you play on the 360 that was so so bad like it was like mario party but not fun at all was like when you had me play yaris i couldn't help it because i was laughing i was just laughing just laughter came out of me playing yaris because it was so what is this i do not even so that's that's worth something um and and bit boy was really a special kind of terrible that i played earlier um this year too that was really bad or last year uh and um going like if i want to go way back okay i remember renting this game on the nintendo entertainment system and thinking it was just like the worst fucking game i'd ever played and i bet nobody's ever even heard of it it was a color dreams game okay they made they made the bootleg carts it was called master chew and the drunk nerd who and i remember this game because it was so terrible i bet that's a game not even jamie knows like that's how obscure this show huh no i've seen it have you it's bad it's bad it's really bad a lot of those color dreams were really bad yeah yeah good stuff bradley any terra bad games you can think of uh worst freaking video game uh the worst a lot of them that are really terrible are like these girl fighting games on like the japanese saturn ones i don't think like ask i don't know if it's like oscar 120 was actually fun i'm thinking of like one of them they might have been a different one from that one but usually they're slow and they make crappy moves and stuff uh with other games were craptastic let's see some of our uh chat room uh saying uh ddr dollar bill says silent assault was another color dreams game that was worse green dragon says princess tomato in the salad kingdom the forest you had to get through was a bigger pain in the ass than the doom dungeon uh let's see uh dash of destruction yaris kabuki warriors says amaze satsuma was a really bad game sir dorks a lot says the ps1 version of samurai showdown 3 was terrible there you go those are some of the responses there from our chat room more facebook questions uh john on facebook also asks the the best geek moment ever this is a good one the best geek moment ever what was your like best geek moment ever this is kind of tricky oh mine's easy that's uh beating the dragon blindfold did in mega man 2 that is pretty geeky and and uh doing you know doing mario ate one blindfolded if if you know your rhythm it's not that hard but the dragon because and that one was also kind of precise timing too so i i've only done it three times nice i can't do it now hell no but when when it was out yeah okay all right alan do you have a best geek moment ever that you can think of not right now all right now i would say mine was probably my first e3 walking through the doors of my first e3 it was kind of like oh this is what i've read about in gaming magazines for so long and i'm actually here and oh my god and then i realized everything was really overpriced and all the lines were long but it was still a pretty cool experience um i thought though this year's e3 was like a close second you know you're my first e3 was definitely my best but this year's e3 was a close second this is a really good e3 this year so what about though going to e3 for the first time is press um that was cool too but i honestly didn't notice that huge of a difference because one thing i've learned about press is that if you don't book your show like six months in advance then you're pretty much having the same show as everyone else plus back in oh six or oh seven i don't remember what year we actually went as press maybe it was oh seven i booked us with bethesda well in advance so we could get in for the star trek screening yeah which ended up being a mediocre game which was too bad yeah and i got into though i got him one time as not as pressed though for a press thing for public cross no i'm sorry for to steal your thunder oh that's okay but it was it was good um yeah there were some really good parties depending on uh what year it was you know uh looking in our chat room and some of the questions uh questions here uh jv mon says my best geek moment was meeting matt smith at the new york city premiere of doctor who series 5 and being on the 13th episode of doctor who confidential uh rama says beating mega man 3 dan shadow says the parties at e3 were insane yep yep what was that place that we went and got beer at they had like 200 anywhere 200 taps on the wall or something like that that place was oh seattle those packs for packs that was epic yes maybe some people are there right now although you know i did enjoy my uh my facebook style photo with jonathan colton that was pretty fun all right um i've got one oh yes uh at anime expo 2000 this is like jamie says you must remember seeing me there it was that was my last day x yeah yeah uh actually stayed up all night uh at the ddr room i didn't i think i only played it once there but i was just they were watching people because i was waiting for that there's like they were having like signings in the morning at disneyland wasn't it was it 2001 at disneyland because then i was there for one after that uh can't remember if that was a long beach winner in disneyland one it wasn't no it hadn't been long beach no no the 2000 was the one at disneyland 2001 was yeah it was at an aheim okay it was one with like a long pier down there we went down there and waited yeah so yeah basically stay up all night watching people play ddr waiting to get signatures from like artists and stuff that's pretty geeky staying up all night to play ddr that was a day charging two dollars a play on a third mix i mostly was just watching because i only played like once because that was the first time i'd ever seen it so it was just kind of interesting to watch then then once i found the ddr usa and at roseville golf land then and then i the obsession began that was the year of the chair here's some more geek moments from chat green dragon says biggest geek moment speaking cling on with my dad dude your dad is cool uh let's see uh gilroy spars which i think is nathan says uh being told about a weekend cabin retreat of drinking and massive dnd playing and being very excited about going that does sound kind of awesome but you have to actually go for it to be a geek moment just you know uh ben jamus a friend of mine irl who's listening says meeting robocop at an la kings game so by the way actually my friend ben is is also jewish dark sakura and i'm supposed to tell you la shana tova is that that that pretty much means have a good year because russia shana is this uh oh there you go wednesday night slash thursday during the day i got it's like i'm i'm like the translator of like jew speak tonight or something i don't know it's just hebrew rob i thought of my geek moment you thought of your geek moment yay um when i was in dmla which was the youth group that i was in uh oh boy we went all right i'm gonna out myself i was in it too and the reason i haven't talked about a lot of the show because not a lot of kids were in it like it's not it's it's youth masonry right so it's like not a lot of the masons before their son usually if your grandpa's in it or you're like in my case you end up being in it you have friends that were in it or what have you but um the the reason why i bring this up before he he says this is um because alan and i were both in this organization so we're convinced that we met each other when we were 15 like at camp at the leadership camp or whatever like we're convinced we met each other and just didn't like you know we weren't really like neither of us were practicing homosexuals at the time and yeah so you know just it was i was like i know i was like magically gathering cards exactly yeah me too i'd be like let's talk about new super nintendo which is weird that we wouldn't have met because we would have had all those same interests like now going but it's just weird i don't know so at the convention which is basically like four days of a bunch of 15 year old boys just staying up and doing convention things i think we hooked up a super ness up to our hotel route tv room and we played i think we played rock and roll racing and street fighter 2 i think for like 36 hours without sleeping oh my god which is something that you can only do when you're 15 i beg to differ oh i beg to differ okay when i it was probably my i'd have to say my second year of college or my first year somewhere around there i was working in the game room and so i brought in my tv and my super nintendo and my friend brought in his import saturn and we had gaming going on in the pool hall all night and i ran dnd games and we did this three nights in a row and i did not sleep and on the fourth day of having been awake i was i sit down at my friend's dorm room and lean back on the cushions while they're playing um whatever i think it was doom at the time and wake up in my own dorm bed oh so they carried you they carried me to my dorm room don't remember any of it don't remember but i'm sorry but the best like dorm slash frat house story that you possibly have was when you missed this show because you were in san diego one weekend and you stayed at the gay frat house can you tell this story again on the show real quick right it's been years i um i went with julie to uh san diego to see um some friends of ours um who one of them lives in japan right now and the other one lives somewhere in town i think now he moved up here he used to be julie's roommate for a while anyway um we uh there was like hardly anywhere else to stay and so the only place i got to stay was this little cot under the stairs it was a little room how did you end up going to a gay frat house as your hotel because the only place that we had to stay was the gay frat house to stay with our friends oh your friend was a gay frat boy yeah okay he lived in the frat house okay so the only spaces like julie slept on i think on some couch and i slept in a little room under the stairs where there had been a mattress it's like the harry potter room we caught that's what he called it the harry potter room and so it had like a little light in there all on its own and everything it was actually kind of neat um i'm very very glad they washed the mattress before i used it i know i was just like think about all the hand jobs have taken place in that little closet all right bro i'm so drunk bro bro where are we at bro sorry but it was it was a fun visit though because we went to extraordinary dessert which is this gourmet dessert shop in san francisco and like amazing stuff and um went to uh julie in california up in the mountains um kind of a little touristy town but it was the first place i ever had buffalo burgers and i came back on i slept in the harry potter room rob i read harry potter in the harry potter room and i was like wait there's gay frat houses like i didn't even know there's like a gay fraternity no i know that now but like 10 years ago i didn't remember however long ago that was all right all that long time ago oh no it's been a long time all right uh redertainment is falling up saying bro don't stop doing that i need to get something else to drink all right um let's see should we move on to another question here uh yes uh another question from john on facebook says the best and worst game tie-ins i.e movies tv so forth although i guess i could go on to like action figures and all that good stuff so the best and the worst tie-ins um i think honestly the best as far as like movies and all that go the silent hill movie was pretty kick-ass like it's even though it wasn't like perfect it was still like miles above anything else i think has come out to this point so um the silent hill movie is probably one of the best um as far as the worst that maniac mansion shows up there that's that was pretty bad or um maybe the pac-man cartoon in the 80s was was not that great either like it really didn't i don't know it didn't didn't work for me i don't know the best and the worst video game tie-ins dark sakura like movie tv best was silent hill i have to agree with you there and you know how many times i've watched it and i bought it on blu-ray because i'm a fucking addict saw it four times in the theater um worst captain n because the characterizations in that were just so awful they were hideous and um i also have to say the the street fighter movie with john claudia van damme poor ral julia having that this is last movie but kali minnow was hot any uh alan about uh captain n yeah jane brought it up i love that show now when

to dante's inferno last year oh that whole debacle tie-ins ever oh what was so terrible about it like see what you can get away with with a booth babe or like or maybe tied for god of war 2 when they served like a goat or something at the press conference and they have the girls in the togas of course it was a fake animal right but they're like oh yeah we have a dead goat for god of war 2 no that's dumb and you're a bad person for thinking of it yeah sony just in general has a lot of really bad tie-ins like sometimes they do really well like the kevin butler stuff but sometimes they do really bad like remember the black and white psp oh yeah oh that was not not good like you just feel secondhand embarrassment for them right or the psp commercial with the squirrels yes all right how about a game to perk us up everybody how about an olr game yay tonight folks we're going to play a game called listless that's where we're going to make the definitive list about a particular topic let me re-explain the way this works if you've never heard listless before because somehow it's almost midnight and there's still almost 100 of you listening so you're up very late so the way this works we're going to put together a definitive list we're going to go around and get the top three answers on the list from each person here in studio so we have a top 12 but then we go around the room and ask which of these is not worthy of the list and we reduce down to the top eight which then you our chat room vote and we'll uh come up with the definitive list and tonight we've got a great topic for you guys tonight's topic is thing i most want to see in the olr marathon 2011 all right the thing i most want to see in next year's olr marathon now we've almost survived through one what do i want to see most next year all right so um now if you guys in chat have uh things you want to add to the list you can try and yell it out in chat if somebody doesn't have any ideas they can try and like you know steal some from chat so we'll see all right uh so we'll start off uh dark sakura you ready to go you want to read the first item on your list number three on dark circles list thing you most want to see at the olr marathon 2011 actually playing games while we broadcast over the web actually playing games while we brought dance in the other and playing his game going i regret nothing

this comment in chat robin allen raychat that'll just be the thing all right number three answer allen loki sings hours of uninterrupted disco karaoke classics in the background of the news story what sorts of uh interrupt uninterrupted classes would he sing um well i know he's already infamous for doing i'm coming out so um i will survive ymca in the navy you know see how long he can go before he starts to cry yeah all right uh let's see number three answer for me my number three answer is corporate sponsorship because i will see you because i will sell out like that yes very practical corporate sponsorship our hour 19 of the olr marathon brought to us tonight by cinnabon every i like sugar we have a delicious cinnabon and my my left arm is tingling and i don't know why but who was that you were talking about once and it was like a i don't know it was like some like really dumpy actress or something that was a total slut and you said ah she looks like she's been glazed up like a cinnabon who was that were you talking about one of our friends yeah okay yeah do we really want to go there right now we can all right no well she was in her hotel room with her boyfriend and i said she's getting oh yeah she's oh god she's getting frosted up like a cinnabon right now because i'm gross like that okay here's the thing no seriously we were in reno and we were gambling we were

and gogo dancers and 8-bit cosplay hey slow that down and say it one more time a live web stream of accompanying gogo dancing people in 8-bit cosplay any particular reason why because i'm we've been doing this for 10 hours and i'm delirious right now all right my ideas are going to be kind of whack all right that's hey that's all right uh my number two answer is somewhat similar i was actually a thing i most want to see on the olr marathon 2011 nudity but not from the hosts so the thing i most want to see in the olr marathon 2011 is nudity but not from the hosts we should hire a stripper for

but no tonight almost midnight still going hi on orange launch radio who's this oh man legend of zaku again zaku again uh what's on your mind yes now i'm just like watching uh paint dry in other words watching my hard drive format for for the past four hours and listening to the show yeah i know it's it's yeah i know but but yeah i guess i don't know if you mentioned any bimani related stuff like um hold on i'll put john speaking like ttrx i mean that's supposed to be location testing in new jersey now wait take us off speaker phone this sucks oh come on it sucks i hate it rob's got a wedgie right now all right all right all right ddr it came up on the show a couple weeks ago um somebody went to the la premiere and we had i don't know somebody was talking about it and i guess i guess the pads are better and it the interface is pretty but otherwise hey it's still ddr well that and they started unlocking songs now so we're getting a lot of like crossover a lot of bimani crossovers i could pull it up and it was like as early as a few days ago they had some they had like i got what songs they had but i know some of them like ah here we go yeah i'm lost uh there's vanessa from 2d x15 that was unlocked um other songs so like songs from a series i stopped following four years ago basically pretty no yeah around that pretty no no what is a pretty no is that like my priorities right now aside from having you know tending to my girlfriend and other things in life yeah so i mean i do play but not as much as i used to and that's that's due to age like i'm getting you know i'm getting pretty old now new york city scene is on on its way out kind of almost dead at this point so we go to new jersey now you got a girlfriend now yeah i've been i've been in a relationship since april oh my gosh how often does she have to be inflated i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding okay i had to all right i'm kidding come on what's what's a little come on i gotta give the listener some crap once in a while all right um but okay so the new york scene is dying i'm sorry to hear that but hey at least you're at least you're getting laid so it all's good with the world right pretty much i mean you know as i said ddr is like it's not as big as it used to be here but whatever we still play somewhat i try to avoid cf like the plague back home in new york coney island's pretty coney island scene is pretty much a you know the wasteland at this point i hate to say it but everyone's going out to either like deep parts of queens or new jersey to play wasn't coney island supposed to get like this huge makeover like like now or something like they're going to reopen it even then luna park doesn't have arcades oh that's a problem all the other arcades i mean the other they used to be an arcade they used to have ddr but it burned down this you know this this past year so i don't know whether they'll have ddr when they rebuild all the other places are pretty much the same i mean it's like i i can't think of any good places to play now even the one that we had in queens basically the mall kicked them out so they got sent further into long island i know it's it's bullshit now i usually go out to like bay tide you know peter pan games to play you know 2dx and and now we have popin 17 yes we've got the latest version of popin in new york i don't know why but that just came up recently i know i'm just trying to keep this show going with this no it's all good i i appreciate your dedication but we're gonna let you go real quick because we have a special announcement to make okay all right make sure to go to 2 p.m well yeah right all right take care buddy bye ladies and gentlemen we have made it to midnight it is now the goal was to make it for 10 hours and we have successfully been broadcasting at lovely all games radio for 10 hours and this is the point where we would call it off but ah let's keep going let's keep another hour let's keep going we got another hour it is let's keep going let's do it let's do it let's do it and then we were forced to eat robin's minstrels yay all right well i get dude did you see the screen was like lit up with calls did you see that like i did oh my gosh all right so we'll try to get a couple more calls how about listless results real fast though before i go back to the phones listless results results the definitive list of the uh things you most want to see in the olr marathon 2011 oops i never counted you are such a dork there's two leaders clearly okay 21 votes for that one it's a tie for first place how do you like that all right that's okay they work well together they were um oh my god the phones are still lighting up hold on we'll get to the phones in a minute uh and oh my god we have a tie for third place too because the first and second got so many votes like everything else got nothing all right well then just read them shit fine here it is tied for number three the most definitive things you want to see on the olr marathon 2011 a laser light show yeah i love how the radio listeners voted for a laser light show um gabe and taiko show up and say this is where the real party's at bitches yay although they won't have to now because packs got moved a week back so they really could do that uh the number two definitive answer and this is it like once once we're past this guys this is the definitive list there's no arguing all right just read it already okay fine live stream of gogo dancing and 8-bit cosplay yay and the number one answer is a tie it's a tie all right read it actually playing games on video yay and these are landslide loki sings hours and hours of disco at the car there you go i brought a bunch of psp and ds games that are still in the car did you because i didn't know what we were gonna do today i i didn't either i i just showed up they're still in the car hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey hello hello hey this is the ddr dollar bill ddr dollar bill what's up $50 bill nothing much it's like three of them half a loopy so join the club you'll be a perfect fit for our show what's on your mind buddy not much i was wanting to call earlier i think uh zacker said about uh going older and not playing games too much and ddr just fading out man i took care of that i mean there's like there's next to no places to play the art anymore and even i stopped playing and i just got i didn't get bored of it i just got tired of all these new kids coming around causing crap and everything you know it it stopped becoming fun i'm interested in some of this resurgence that's coming up namely dance central and dance masters and part of the reason that interests me is because it's very different like it's a whole new way to kind of play a dance game it's not just stomping on a mat and the song list for dance central like i love the fact that both these games exist because there's truly something for everyone there's dance central for those folks that really want something in the mainstream and like their you know music to be in the mainstream and top 40 and then for folks that have really grown up on the you know bamani hits from japan there's dance masters i really think there's something for everyone on connect and i it's kind of exciting where that that's going and it almost makes me like excited about music games again is that game ddr no but you know ddr is a great no but you know ddr has been around since 1998 it's it's it's been an epically long series it's it's okay for it to be dying out right about now you know i'm not disagreeing with that i you know i don't mind it dying out because it's you know forever but my only thing with the two dance games that i was thinking about when i actually saw it was one both of them i would actually like to see something where you can make your own choreography not just follow what they have on screen like everything seems to be set to so you pick one song you follow that choreography for that song and never changes and i kind of want to see because they have it's the way it looks like it's that they're broken to sections so you have a four four beat for one step maybe two two beats for another step you know you kind of like put it together the way it looks in the commercials you know versus us whatever and the way i'm thinking is if there is some way maybe to shuffle something around so you can kind of make your own choreography to the song your own version to it i mean that's one way i'm thinking it would actually make the game a little better because otherwise i mean i could see being good but at the same time i don't know it just seems it just seems kind of too limited i honestly honestly think that dance masters is the future of ddr like i think that's where konami's put in their stock is this whole connect thing and if it takes off you're going to see something like it in arcades too man i hope so i mean if they fix the lag and connect in the connect yeah this will definitely take off like crazy and i can even see dance schools utilizing this we'll see all right buddy i'm going to let you go to get some more calls but thanks so much for the call okay i'll get some coffee see you later all right good luck all right we'll try and get some more calls in now one eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype is orange launch radio we still have one more game we want to play for the night's over um and we'll probably do that in the last segment here after another break well i'm trying to at least get a couple more calls in if there's still people interested in calling so we'll give it a couple more minutes one eight seven seven game olr our username is skype is orange laundry oh hi you're on the olrathon who's this it's misty hi misty how are you i'm doing good awesome the walmart thing though yeah in the middle of the night it's called i closed and i need some dvds to burn shit too i see are you actually close to a walmart where you are whoa i got a ride home that night but still i see all right well i sometimes you need to make the emergency walmart run i suppose although i don't know like i i wish they had 24-hour targets and yes i i realize like i'm supposed to be boycotting target apparently but i don't i can't like they're less evil than walmart yes they're it's it's the lesser of two evils still they could donate another 150 000 whatever organization it still is less evil than walmart in my book but i'm just i'm i'm a hippie like that whatever so well anything uh what about games and stuff any gamey related things you want to share things you've been playing lately i've been working on some green day rock band on off during the show admittedly how is that i i like it it turns out that i like more green day stuff than i thought i originally would because i never got back in the day have you ever done that when like you get one of those like type of uh band packs or band games or whatever you're kind of like oh i didn't realize they sang that song because i've kind of had that happen like buying greatest hits cds you know you're listening to and you're like oh this band did that song too and i never realized that did you kind of have that going on for rock band dlc it's been more i got i sheaped into buying some dlc and it's like oh this ain't bad nice all right well misty i'll we'll let you get back to some green day rock band so we can take some more calls but um enjoy your uh future trips to walmart and enjoy green day rock band okay okay thanks all right later

now the person that i know that is the most like anal retentive about their mp3 collection would be alan so would you ever subject your mp3 collection to a program like this i'm too ocd to let anything automated affect my mp3 tags yeah i i you would like i could see that it would like put the space in the wrong place and you'd just be like no oh yeah if it if it took all of my compilations and unchecked the compilation tag and like a batch process i would i would die it'd be over yeah what's ever going to happen if that drive died do you have a backup somehow or what's going to happen a tape backup somehow so far my music collection is still able to fit onto my mondo giant ipod so so long as i have my ipod i just keep everything on there and it's yeah all right well i think that's
