5780	9442	And welcome back everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon.
9502	11644	That's right, we're doing a marathon podcast this week.
12604	13725	Basically, just because we can.
13765	15546	We're going to podcast as long as we possibly can.
15886	17888	Here on this Saturday, September the 5th of 2010.
19048	20629	It won't be anything that impressive, you guys.
20649	26153	We're thinking about going about for 12 hours or so, just talking about video games and reminiscing about old games and all that good stuff.
27233	30275	So we just finished the normal show.
30355	34077	So if this is the first thing that you're hearing on the podcast feed, you're going to want to go back.
34318	37599	The actual show show was put up earlier this week.
37679	40761	So just double check your podcast feed to make sure you kind of have everything.
42302	64714	at the very end of the show we had some problems with our chat room our internet went down right in the middle of everything and we ended up getting booted from our server and all this stuff it was terrible but we think we've got that all worked out thank you to Alan who is like a bigger nerd than me I never thought I would be able to say that but yes he's a bigger nerd than me he knew how to set this whole thing up what are we doing right now Alan how are we getting an IRC
65706	71628	My roommate has a domain name that he uses for a little Linux box that we run out of our spare bedroom.
71668	72668	It's a little mail server.
73229	76410	So we're SSHed into that box and we're running IRC from there.
76610	78530	So we're just shelled into my computer at home.
80371	80631	All right.
81371	82692	I got a little OCD with the mic cord.
83069	84590	DarkSakura, tell us a little bit about the vault.
98786	105230	It's a room in the back of my house that has all of our game crap in it.
105650	110774	And I totally meant to grab my iPhone so that I could actually take pictures and put them up on the website.
112275	114316	I could try doing the Ustream thing real fast.
114356	116877	I don't know how well this is going to work, but I'll try it.
118398	120340	I'm stepping on stuff.
120360	121801	Alan, you could read chat for a little bit.
121821	122641	Or you want to be cameraman?
122721	124002	I'll do cameraman for a minute here.
125143	126944	This is all live radio, folks.
128544	132127	So everyone has to come in here and pick one thing.
133348	134649	All right, we'll come in a minute.
134669	137692	I'm going to see if I can do this broadcasting.
137752	138372	Okay, let's see.
138713	142015	Well, since we're already in here, Bradley, why don't you pick something?
143316	145118	DarkSakura, I'm going to bring in the camera, okay?
145438	146899	I'm going to bring in the camera.
146919	147400	Is that okay?
147840	149301	Okay, just as long as it's not me on it.
149361	150082	I'll try my best.
150122	151063	Just dodge my phone.
151383	152584	Then I better put my phone back in here.
152784	153044	All right.
153825	154886	I had Bradley pick something.
155399	158260	Yeah, yeah.
158420	160740	We're live and I don't even know where we're at.
160780	166702	We're at Ustream slash Orange Lounge, I think, is where we're broadcasting at.
167622	169283	So I'm going to go make my way into the vault.
170763	172424	I'll give my mic to Alan while I walk over there.
173104	180046	Right now we have Bradley going through the Saturn section of my house, which is pretty much our domestic Saturn stuff.
180866	181806	Yeah, at the moment.
181906	184647	And the dusty little things here.
186215	187616	is it like candy what was that is it like candy
200942	205185	Yeah.
205485	206046	Let's see.
206086	206826	I saw one up here.
207327	208848	I think Blazing Dragons.
208868	209608	That was a fun game.
209869	213191	It's like a puzzle game where you control the dragon.
214892	216674	Let's go ahead and pull it out.
216714	220376	Put it on the camera.
220797	223839	Oh, there are Capcom shot glasses.
227768	241803	Go ahead and put it up on the... Basically it's a comedy puzzle game where you go around and try to figure out how to solve certain puzzles where you gotta satisfy what a person wants you to do for them.
243204	251287	Something like you need to wash all the dishes, so you have to put together a Rube Goldberg device to rig up the dishes.
252068	263773	Basically, it puts something on top of a fire to blow a turntable around or a fan around so they can put it in a system.
264553	269115	And there's catapulting one place where you have to shoot a cat at a wall.
270831	272614	Rob, your turn to pick something.
285072	285632	Am I on here?
285672	286273	I don't even know.
286393	288394	Is it going through, Alan?
288994	292656	We don't usually do remote broadcasting from the other rooms, so this is a little different for us.
293376	294797	I don't know what to pick.
296178	297919	Okay, you want to hold this while I dig through something?
298059	298979	Okay, hold on.
300500	302281	This is awesome radio, I'm sure.
303422	308424	I see all these NES games up here, and I'm assuming that one of these is going to be something awesome.
309065	309425	It could be.
310160	310760	or it could suck.
310840	311260	I don't know.
311760	316382	God, you have like all these like Japanese games stacked on top of everything too.
316402	316802	What are those?
317262	317542	Let's see.
317582	317942	I don't know.
318522	320823	Oh, Final Fantasy 3 and Mappy.
320883	321323	And Mappy.
321343	322784	And apparently you paid 20 bucks for each one.
322864	323164	No, I didn't.
323184	323564	I paid five.
324944	325684	They were marked down.
325744	326244	They were marked down.
326284	327285	Let's see what's in this one here.
329265	331586	Gradius, Track and Field, Contra.
332146	333546	Just push the button.
333587	333947	What happened?
333967	334167	Did it?
334347	334727	It locked.
334967	335427	It locked?
335867	336167	Warning.
336567	336867	Okay.
337067	338148	Are we go live?
338628	338788	Yeah.
338808	338888	Yeah.
340109	341671	Okay, now we're connecting now.
341691	343293	Maybe we have to plug it in, I don't know.
344154	345515	Okay, we're connecting now.
345556	345836	Sorry.
346156	348439	I don't know, I wasn't prepared to dig through here.
348499	349580	Hold on, let me look at Super Nintendo.
349600	350121	Got your mic.
350141	350221	Hi.
350241	350441	Hello.
351563	352263	Hello.
357765	362908	So I think someone looked up the correct channel name and put it in IRC.
362949	368512	I think it's orange-lounge-radio for the Ustream.
369433	371194	So that's all taken care of.
371494	372215	Good, good deal.
373355	373996	Let's see.
375217	377238	You got all these Mega Man games in this one.
378039	384083	Yeah.
384143	385904	Rob started to make the face.
389150	398964	I'll talk about this game Yep, it's Super Metroid Can you give me a mic?
401148	403489	Super Metroid is the game I picked up there.
403529	408110	Super Metroid is probably one of the greatest video games they ever freaking made, ever.
408150	409770	It's probably my favorite video game of all time.
409790	411090	It happens to be in this little bin right here.
411570	413411	If I can hold this up for the Ustream viewers, too.
414011	418632	Super Metroid is amazeballs because it's kind of a quick game.
419172	424953	It's not something that takes you days and days to beat, so you can play through it in a good sitting, in a day.
424973	427254	If you wanted to play through this tonight, we probably could.
427614	428495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
449369	452210	Show off different tricks or try to find things that are hidden.
452550	458852	And it really kind of set the stage for things that followed it that are also awesome, like Castlevania, which a lot of people started calling Metroidvania.
459412	466294	And just the music was phenomenal and the upgrades to the weapons, just like everything about it was just super.
467134	470677	So that's why Super Metroid is definitely a fond favorite of mine.
471238	475221	So that's something I've talked about many times on the show before.
475241	476502	It's one of my personal favorite games.
477083	478664	We need to find a box for it, I think.
480546	482307	Okay, so Alan, it's your turn.
482668	484069	Pick us something that you see.
491744	493225	Sounds currently digging through the vault.
494506	499109	I don't know if I like this whole Ustream thing though because it's too much for us to monitor because trying to run the radio feed is bad enough.
499349	499630	Yeah.
499890	502111	So we might kill this video feed.
504173	504433	All right.
504533	507115	I'm going to... I've just been running my thumb over it to keep it active.
507135	507315	All right.
507335	510757	I'm going to kill the video feed for now until we have something a little more worthy of showing on video.
511338	511738	Sorry, guys.
512018	512418	Sorry, guys.
514060	515821	But it's also like killing the battery on my phone.
517062	517562	Roger, if you want.
517896	518637	I guess I could always do that.
518678	519880	Oh, my phone is hot.
520000	521983	It feels like it's going to explode in my hands.
522043	523225	That's probably not a good thing, is it?
523245	523746	Is it gushy?
524908	529035	So tell the listeners a little bit about where you collect all of these different games from.
529500	530541	Every freaking where.
530721	531682	I mean, seriously.
534224	545954	We used to just go hit up thrift stores and the flea market and a couple of used game places in town and just pick up things when we could find them.
546454	551759	Like, when we got our Nomad, it was right when they stopped making the Nomads and we managed to get ours on clearance for $25.
551799	551899	Yeah.
553180	554481	Marvel Super Heroes for the Sega Saturn
577807	605042	one of the advantages of owning a Saturn in the US compared to the original PlayStation was that the original PlayStation was crap for 2D games the Saturn could do arcade perfect frame rates for all of the over-the-top Capcom X-Men licensed games like Children of the Atom I got my Saturn for this game and then I got it chipped and I imported Darkstalkers 3 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter so this is definitely a lot of hours logged on this one
607299	608640	I really like that game.
609200	617523	Although, I wonder what it would have been like if they had released the 1 meg and 4 meg cart in the US, if that would have just made it completely a lot more awesome.
617583	621605	Because that's why X-Men vs. Street Fighter is only really playable on the Saturn.
622205	624125	Because of the cartridge.
624586	627427	Okay, my turn.
628307	629948	Shoot, this is all my shit.
633004	633384	Crap.
634625	637007	I know hue cards are in there somewhere.
638548	640609	Have you done some rearranging in the vault lately?
640689	641450	Dan did some.
641510	643051	You guys took the couch out of here.
643151	644552	The futon is gone.
644612	645072	We got rid of it.
645172	645452	Oh, wow.
645472	648334	I was thinking we'd all have a futon to sit on in here, but I guess that's not the case.
648414	650316	So we will have to go out to the front room at some point.
650716	652297	Hopefully our mics will get us out there, too.
652897	653398	That'll be good.
653458	653938	I'm sure.
654098	655819	God, I can't think.
656280	658481	I'm noticing Atari 2600 stuff here.
658501	661643	This is sort of our, we have nowhere else to put this stuff shelf.
663425	667890	Um, C-Man, so we can friend your butt.
669091	674538	Okay, I think this is, um, nope, that's not it.
674578	678262	It's a soundtrack for Berserk, for the video game.
679229	679669	Thanks for watching!
694623	695823	It's been redone since then though.
695843	696423	We need to do a new video.
696443	697464	It has changed a little bit.
697484	700344	We do need to get some new video other than what we just showed on Ustream.
700384	703825	But you can get an idea just how massive this collection is.
703925	707986	Like, you know, I'm looking one way and I see two TVs up on the wall.
708506	710326	PlayStation 2 rack of games.
710427	711787	I see Neo Geo games.
712207	713747	I see all these arcade sticks.
714367	715128	I look another way.
715168	716508	I see different steering wheels.
716768	717488	I picked something.
717588	719068	A CDX.
719348	719989	It's a CDX.
720009	720749	You're not picking a game.
720769	721629	You're picking a CDX.
722040	723461	Well, I didn't say you had to pick a game.
723501	724141	I said pick something.
724221	724521	Alright, fine.
724541	725581	What do you want to say about the CDX?
725821	730403	It's awesome and it's like having a really tiny Sega CD.
730823	732764	Although it does not work very well with the 32X.
732784	736926	You have to kind of modify the hookup and get these brackets to hold it up.
736966	738486	But the CDX is freaking awesome.
739527	740607	And I love it.
740767	742048	I love it quite dearly.
743888	745969	How'd you guys end up with two Game Gears over here?
745989	747089	I'm looking at two Game Gears.
747129	748570	One of them's blue and one of them's black.
748690	750651	I think the blue one is Julie's.
751772	753232	The Game & Watch Collection
776574	781657	I owned a Game Gear briefly in the 8th grade, and I've seen one now.
781997	783598	I do not remember it being that gigantic.
783979	784599	It's huge.
784619	786220	It's like bigger than a VHS tape.
786480	787661	I don't... And they're heavy.
787981	789742	Well, we've got the battery attached to this.
791183	792284	The little backup battery thing.
792304	795726	Yeah, I don't... Well, you want to see big, though.
795746	798328	We've got links somewhere around here.
800469	803211	And... All of our stuff is so dusty.
803711	805372	We need to... Do we have another mic on the ground?
809106	810467	Yeah, we've got stuff everywhere.
811808	815151	I like this stress grip Game Boy Advance.
815291	819715	That was a promo thing from E3, I think, a while back.
821388	827214	I actually had a pink Game Boy Advance, just to be completely opposite of what everyone would think of me, because I normally hate pink.
845353	848314	and I actually really dug my pink one and had pink everything.
848895	853978	I don't know if you noticed but a reoccurring theme in my Saturn collection is working designs and Capcom.
855819	860361	I still have my copy of Rayearth that working designs did for the Saturn.
860541	864243	It's one of the last games that came out for the Saturn in the US.
864804	866065	Let me see what I've got up here.
866085	867545	Rayearth is right here.
869690	869990	Saga Ages
897837	899618	Um, what's that one right there?
900158	902059	Let me, can I actually jump in here, you guys, real quick?
902879	902999	Oh.
903099	903860	I'm actually in the other room.
903880	904220	Albert Odyssey.
904580	914044	Or I'm watching the chat room, and I actually want to jump in here and say real quick, because it is 6 o'clock Pacific at this time, so we might have some folks tuning in right now expecting to hear Orange Haunch Radio kind of like as it normally is.
914664	919206	You forgot that this week is the marathon episode, so we've actually been on the air since 2 p.m.
919606	923728	So if you're just joining us now expecting to hear the normal episode of OLR, it already happened.
923748	924688	We finished that up at about 5.30, so...
926309	927370	Loki is gone.
927470	929071	He went back to go take care of the baby.
929671	934873	But I'm here, Rob Roberts, and DarkSakura's here as well, as well as SalaciousPop and Arcadium42.
934974	938475	And right now we're looking in the vault at just some old games.
938495	945679	Just kind of thumbing through and seeing what nostalgic dust is awakened from some of it.
948120	950301	Yeah, we were going through my list of working designs games.
951522	953203	So yeah, back here, that's Albert Odyssey, I think.
954123	956125	I actually decided to sell my copy of that off.
956165	958007	I only paid a little bit of it.
958027	967436	You've also got Shining Wisdom, Dragon Force, Sonic R. I love Sonic R, don't get me wrong.
967736	968657	Can you feel the sunshine?
969678	970519	Does it brighten up your day?
973001	975763	But yeah, we've got tons of crap.
975783	982348	Dude, now I want to break out the Saturn for reals and play stuff, but Dan has the Saturn hooked up in here, and the monitor's, like, little.
983289	985150	I want to play the Saturn in the front room.
985845	991669	So the stuff that we actually have hooked up right now in here is we've got things set up on Switch boxes.
992269	1005799	We've got an Xbox 360, Dreamcast, Saturn, GameCube, Neo Geo CD, Super Nintendo, Turbo Duo, and the Sega CD32X.
1005819	1005879	And...
1010612	1012413	What else do we have sort of put away?
1014174	1015814	Where did Dan put the actual Neo Geo?
1016675	1017955	Because we actually have a Neo Geo.
1018536	1025519	And then I think it's funny, Dan got the Atari Flashback 2 that looks like the old 2600, but it's got 40 games stored in it.
1026799	1029861	And, you know, I could break out my What the Fuck game.
1030841	1032462	Cardcaptor Sakura that comes with a plate.
1033122	1033403	Oh, wow.
1033603	1034983	And a clock.
1035804	1036364	And silverware.
1036877	1039819	I think you showed all that in the unboxing video that you did on YouTube.
1039879	1041120	It's in the unboxing video.
1041140	1048304	Because, man, I'm not trying to sound braggy or anything.
1048344	1049665	I mean, we just have this stuff.
1051486	1054668	And, oh, the R4 with the JogCon set.
1055309	1062273	I got that for painting a Sonic on the door of a local used game store.
1062293	1064735	I remember video game swappers back in the day.
1066618	1082787	but that's how I got my R4 and JogCon and we've got the boxes of controllers and they're just different systems and stuff here's the box of Playstation controllers which I think the NegCon is in I'm gonna fish that out who wants my mic?
1084591	1085712	GameCube and Xbox MyNedCon
1112779	1115582	Wow, you guys have some really obscure stuff.
1115983	1129338	Let's talk about the vault for a little bit, because we had a lot of people in chat, and I'm sure a lot of listeners of the show that are like, wow, you guys are kind of like a special kind of crazy, having your own room in the house dedicated to like a video game museum sort of thing.
1129578	1132081	And how did this all start between you and Dan?
1132945	1133345	Oh, gee.
1133786	1139190	Well, when Dan and I first got together, he had already had a bunch of stuff.
1139450	1151919	I mean, he had a Neo Geo and a few games, and he had a NES, and he had a SNES, and I moved out here with my SNES and a few PlayStation games, and he had a PlayStation and a Saturn, and...
1152739	1158180	We just sort of would get nostalgic about stuff and go looking for things.
1159000	1160880	We ended up getting the Turbo Duo.
1161381	1163481	No, I think he already had the Turbo Duo when I moved out here.
1164221	1165281	Let me take it a step back.
1165321	1167782	I know you've told this story sometimes on the show before.
1167842	1168802	We have time to kill tonight.
1168882	1170362	How did you and Dan kind of end up meeting?
1170422	1172442	How did you and Dan kind of come together?
1172462	1172983	Yeah, have a seat.
1173223	1175443	We're sitting on the floor of the vault just chatting.
1176163	1177143	No chatters right now.
1177203	1181544	Sorry, chat room, but you're in the other room where we can't see you, but we'll run back and look in a minute.
1182043	1191611	Back in the day, when I lived in Mobile, Alabama, Dan was a friend of mine online.
1191731	1198097	My roommates introduced me to him because he had the name Dark Ryoga and I had the name Dark Uchan.
1198977	1208162	So we hung out for a while and he was my buddy and would be up like really late my time, you know, relatively late his time.
1208802	1212264	And just exchanged bad fan fiction and he was, you know, my buddy, he was fun.
1213004	1219808	And then I had a really, really bad breakup with the guy I was with at the time.
1220629	1235724	and Dan called me and to cheer me up he had like some five minute calling cards and he ended up using like three of them I think that night and when we ended up talking the next night and I called him and he called me and we'd talk on the payphone from Denny's you know and stuff it was
1236785	1243271	And then finally one day, at the time I was working at, I think I'd since moved from working at the arcade.
1244311	1248275	I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyber Station at the malls.
1248895	1254520	But I went from working there to working at this herb shop kiosk in the mall.
1255560	1279794	and it was really great you know I could sit and read my books all day if I wanted to and so Dan we've been talking the night before because we're trying to open up another store so that we can make enough revenue to keep two stores open instead of having to close the one we had and I said hey if we don't get the show then in the show the store then can I come out and stay with you I was just joking he's like I guess so and so
1280234	1284217	So the next day I go to work and they said, yeah, they gave our spot to somebody else.
1284257	1285358	We have to close the store in a month.
1286278	1288200	I was like, so when my boss left, I called Dan.
1288240	1289441	I was like, so were you serious?
1289461	1290622	He's like, I guess so.
1290882	1292183	We're going to go see Batman.
1292223	1293003	We'll talk about this later.
1294204	1296666	If that dates when the conversation happened.
1298047	1299568	The original Batman was like 91.
1300029	1301630	It can't be that bad.
1301811	1304253	It was one of the sequels.
1304913	1306575	No, 89 was the original Batman.
1310459	1314963	But at any rate, I was actually on the plane probably within two weeks.
1316284	1320067	And I've been happy here ever since I came out here with 100 bucks in my pocket and a Super Nintendo.
1321889	1324091	Did you literally pack a Super Nintendo in your luggage?
1343104	1344367	Whatever happened to all your stuff at home?
1344407	1345509	Did you ever go back to get it?
1345609	1347713	Or did you just have it shipped here in little bits and pieces?
1347773	1349235	Or did you just kind of let it rot?
1349576	1352421	Well, I would go back and visit and bring stuff back with me.
1352461	1353964	And Grandma would send me some of my stuff.
1355250	1356731	Little things like that, but I lost a lot.
1357112	1359553	I kept bringing back boxes of comics for some reason.
1360214	1365898	But a lot of my books were water damaged from how poorly they were being stored.
1369020	1371521	I lost a lot of cool stuff.
1371581	1374203	I did manage to bring back a lot of cool stuff with me.
1374263	1376605	So most of my things, I think, are back with me.
1377005	1381148	A lot of stuff from my dorm room I really wanted because they were things that...
1381708	1385750	People picked up for me from Civil War reenactments and Ren Fairs and things.
1386370	1399296	Okay, so now we're kind of getting caught up to where we were at before, is that you came out here and you had only the Super Nintendo and a couple PlayStation games, but you obviously had this nerd love thing going on with Dan, right?
1399776	1401477	Yeah, that's from the AVA.
1401677	1404098	So you guys just kind of started mutually this collection together?
1404158	1407220	Do you remember what the first thing was you guys bought together?
1407460	1407840	Do you remember?
1407860	1407940	Yeah.
1408194	1410836	I don't really remember all that well, to be honest.
1410896	1411897	That's okay.
1414940	1418522	I know one of the early things, because I think he already had a Genesis.
1419904	1421385	We picked up a Sega CD together.
1421445	1422846	That was one of the first things that we got.
1423446	1425808	Because we really wanted to play Sega CD games.
1425888	1429071	And we found it cheap, and then we got 32X after that.
1429812	1432654	It just kept growing, you know, really fast.
1434095	1435715	We would just find things.
1435955	1439097	Oh shoot, I was listing out all my stuff and I forgot to put my Wonderswan color on it.
1440277	1446460	No, no, I was recently putting all my stuff up for Infamous.net because they wanted the list of my gaming systems and I forgot the Wonderswan.
1446640	1446840	Anyway.
1447621	1449521	Well, now you're just going to lose all that cred.
1450282	1450502	Now.
1451207	1456994	But, I mean, the way things went, it was just, we would run in and, oh, that's cool, oh, that's cool, oh, that's cool.
1457655	1461520	And then, you know, would sometimes say, I really want to play this game.
1461540	1466506	Like, we picked up a Neo Geo, not Neo Geo, a Turbo Duo, not Turbo Duo.
1467407	1472370	PC Engine Core Graphics Sorry, I had to think of system and country and everything.
1472791	1476893	Which is the Japanese version of the TurboGrafx.
1478114	1480496	Because you cannot play the HuCard games.
1480616	1481837	They are not compatible.
1481917	1488241	There's one converter that's supposed to work okay.
1489002	1489742	We could never get to work.
1489802	1491863	And if you find that one converter, it's super expensive.
1491903	1493545	So we may as well just buy the system.
1494265	1497167	So we got a Core Graphics so we could play our Japanese HuCards.
1497227	1497346	Thanks for watching!
1498382	1499022	Nice.
1499062	1504483	I mean, a lot of it is just like, it's here, we have the money right now, why don't we get it?
1505243	1509824	And then Dan was working at GameStop and then GameCrazy, so when he knew stuff that come out, he'd be like, let's get it.
1510704	1518946	And when the PS3 came out, he had just quit GameStop, but he had put in his pre-order as manager, so he was first in line.
1519646	1520426	So he went and got it.
1520546	1524147	And then Discover gave us a $100 credit back because he had spent so much.
1524427	1524647	Nice.
1524807	1526148	So he basically got our $700 system for $600.
1526188	1526268	Cool.
1528428	1529309	Yeah, and we still have it.
1529829	1531550	Our original PS3 works just fine.
1531790	1537113	So it's just one of those things where your collection just kept growing and growing and growing and then it suddenly needed its own room because you're just both gamers.
1537133	1538254	I wonder what that is behind you.
1538294	1539755	Will you grab me that black and blue case, please?
1539915	1540876	The black and blue case.
1540916	1541096	Hold on.
1541116	1541476	I'm looking for it.
1541496	1542317	I want to see what it is.
1543137	1547080	Because keep in mind, we also have a lot of stuff just packed up in... Oh, it's empty, isn't it?
1547760	1548481	It feels empty.
1548621	1549241	Okay, then it's empty.
1549301	1549601	I'm right.
1550482	1552383	Because we've just got stuff packed up in...
1554344	1574776	bags and things old systems like I think one of the things behind you is an Xbox in that black and red case there that's where we keep the Neo Geo like the AVS cartridge Neo Geo and someone just sold us a Neo CD for like 100 bucks with a bunch of games so I mean like I said when we get these things they sort of fall into our lap
1575818	1577961	Where do you think all this stuff's going to end up someday?
1578341	1580263	Do you see yourselves hanging on to this forever?
1580563	1581965	Or what's going to happen?
1582025	1583526	Passing it on to children?
1583727	1586389	Dan's talked about selling it a couple of times.
1587771	1591535	And then we get talking about it and neither of us can really see ourselves parting with it.
1591715	1592195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1608714	1613477	It really just sort of happened up there with all the Bimani stuff when we really got into music games.
1614577	1620480	We just kept getting controllers and systems and, oh, American Beatmania 2DX, let's get it!
1621121	1627244	And, you know, the guitar freaks, we both had to have a guitar and then I found the drum kit really cheap.
1628104	1630966	from not Toys and Joys, but it was another importer.
1631926	1635389	Speaking randomly of American 2DX, I want to throw this out here.
1635429	1640532	It wasn't news that made the earlier show, but Naoki runs a Facebook, and it really is him.
1640612	1641933	I asked him when I saw him at E3.
1642313	1652759	It's his Facebook, and he was actually asking questions about music games on there this week, and he actually said, like, you know, what type of music game is your favorite, and would you want to see another karaoke type of game?
1653240	1655301	And overwhelmingly, it seemed the response was like,
1655561	1657503	No, we don't need any more karaoke games.
1657623	1661306	And everybody was like, 2DX, 2DX, 2DX, bring 2DX on the PS3.
1661667	1663448	Please release on the PS3.
1663528	1669654	Because if they did release it, it would be region-free, where even if they released it in Japan, you know you're going to have tons of people over here buying it.
1669854	1670415	Oh, hell yes.
1670615	1672336	That might be part of the reason it's getting held up.
1672677	1677701	Maybe they're having problems with music licenses or what have you, although I don't think they license a lot of music for Beatmania anymore.
1678022	1678322	I don't know.
1678703	1683444	Well, um... I actually answered on the thing, too.
1683564	1683824	Did you?
1683944	1685125	And I was reading other people's responses.
1685145	1685565	They were funny.
1685665	1686625	I did, but I got in late.
1689446	1690946	But, yeah, the pink biscuit's up there.
1690966	1694027	I think we bought a friend of ours, Parapara.
1694107	1694807	Parapara.
1695348	1698609	Up at the very top, to the left of Samba de Amigo in Keyboard Mania.
1699369	1702930	Which soon The Connect is going to be taking the place of some of that type of stuff.
1703010	1704210	It's funny how technology's come.
1704370	1705370	I really want a Parapara game.
1705390	1706331	I want a tech Parapara game.
1709152	1713173	Well, our other thing, too, is that Dan and I like playing games with good controllers.
1713733	1715414	We love controllers.
1716494	1718914	What other good, like, back-in-the-day topics can we talk about?
1719315	1721855	We can talk about, try to remember the first time we all met.
1722375	1725696	I don't know if I totally remember the very first time I met DarkSakura.
1725716	1725916	I remember.
1725976	1726816	It was at Milpitas, wasn't it?
1726836	1728497	It was at Milpitas Golf Line playing Parapara.
1728737	1728937	Yeah?
1729077	1729897	And you showed up with Jessica.
1730549	1732191	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1747253	1753596	A lot of people don't know that is that she and I actually played our very first game of DDR together.
1753776	1759519	And it's kind of funny because we both ended up taking... We actually went... And I think this is kind of common knowledge now.
1759539	1760640	We had a spat for many years.
1760680	1763482	We had a personal disagreement that just got way out of control.
1763522	1764622	And it was really ugly.
1764742	1766143	We've worked our stuff out since then.
1767424	1769184	We have a pleasant friendship and everything.
1769204	1772086	And I think it's great that she's back on Under Sedation Live.
1772106	1773867	And I know her and Travis have always had a really funny...
1774167	1775407	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1797594	1814937	DDR Freak Radio was a project and it was always I haven't talked about this a lot but you know we're in the marathon part of the show we don't expect a lot of people to listen to when DDR Freak Radio kind of first came out we were at least I think you kind of knew about both projects we couldn't say anything because you kind of had to walk like this delicate line right
1815362	1816923	Which is what I was doing for a long time.
1830888	1831688	our real name
1863904	1867005	I think a lot of people don't realize that... This is Alex.
1867385	1868005	Hi, Alex.
1868205	1868665	How are you doing?
1868685	1869286	Come in real quick.
1869306	1869686	Say hi to everybody.
1869706	1871206	We're actually broadcasting our marathon.
1871226	1872226	I don't know if Dan told you.
1872266	1874167	We're on a marathon episode of our show right now.
1874507	1875007	Marathon.
1875027	1876107	It was a marathon.
1876447	1877208	How are you doing, Alex?
1877828	1878508	Doing pretty good.
1878608	1881449	Do you have an online... You've got to get real close to the... These mics aren't very sensitive.
1881469	1883309	Do you have an online name you use that you want people to know?
1884029	1887530	I suppose you can tell people that I use the name Five Gears.
1887670	1888550	Five Gears.
1889011	1889771	All right, Five Gears.
1889811	1890571	What kind of games do you play?
1891815	1893436	Mostly single player today.
1893917	1895998	I can't afford to play Xbox Live.
1896018	1897660	I hear they're jacking up the price ten bucks.
1897680	1898580	We just talked about that earlier.
1900002	1905346	Yeah, that's... Well, I don't usually play online anymore.
1906627	1908789	But when I did, it was a lot of Halo.
1909029	1913372	And I'm probably going to have to, depending on how Reach goes, because I'm going to try that out.
1914753	1916295	Not that it's here or anything.
1916475	1919097	Just, you know, you're going to try it someday.
1919117	1919537	Legally.
1919577	1919958	Legally.
1920698	1921199	Oh, of course.
1921359	1921839	Absolutely.
1922400	1926805	But when I try it out, I'll see if it's worth actually playing.
1927866	1932310	And playing online with friends is really the only reason why I ever did it in the first place.
1932390	1934392	I have all kinds of online games on PC.
1935554	1936254	Hey, hey, hey.
1937375	1937896	Not gonna lie.
1938777	1939738	World of Warcraft.
1939798	1940579	I used to play that.
1941030	1941571	I still do.
1941931	1945595	I was talking about the Cataclysm beta earlier in the show, playing that a little bit.
1945695	1948297	When are you going to get the needle out of your arm, man?
1948577	1950840	When my friends stop playing, because honestly, that's the only reason I play.
1950880	1951260	No, really.
1951320	1951700	I mean, it is.
1951720	1955524	And they're my real-life friends and people I know in the Bay Area and Allen.
1955744	1958347	We all play together, and it's just kind of like the thing now.
1958627	1964553	I could give a shit about the game itself a lot of days, but it's just kind of the way we all hang out.
1964653	1965873	It's kind of nerdy, but awesome.
1965893	1967034	No, no, no, that's fine.
1967154	1971996	You know, it used to be, for me, it was all about just playing first-person shooters online with people.
1972696	1974737	Well, that's what my college buddies and I used to do.
1974757	1975977	We used to play Quake online.
1976017	1978738	We used to play Halo 2 for a long time.
1979158	1979798	All that good stuff.
1980099	1985000	Yeah, no, for me right now, if I do play online at all, it's Bad Company 2 on PC.
1985381	1985621	All right.
1985881	1987961	By the way, you should be voicing movie trailers, just so you know.
1988302	1989342	Let's just all just make voices.
1990050	1991211	Another Solid Snake impression?
1991952	1996176	I'm getting my impressions mixed up.
1999719	2002202	Alan's looking at chat and they think he's Solid Snake?
2002802	2003103	Awesome.
2003603	2004864	Awesome.
2005105	2007767	If you want to look at chat and read us some comments, there's a mic in there that's hot.
2007787	2009629	You just have to be loud enough for us to hear you back here.
2011653	2012433	He's going in there.
2012493	2019677	He's going in there to see if... I feel bad because we've been neglecting the chat room, but we're having memories here.
2022118	2022618	Where was I?
2022638	2027300	I was talking about the conflict that Iguana Girl and I had, but we're cool now.
2027680	2029201	And then I was talking about... Yeah, now she hates me.
2029641	2032222	Well... I can't give a shit.
2032622	2034203	I'm trying to stay with the positive.
2034223	2034663	I am.
2034823	2038465	But I was talking about the conflict, but then, okay, the day, there was a New Year's,
2039505	2041067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2055000	2057763	from Orange Lounge Studios for DDR Free Radio.
2058304	2064230	That was like the Nintendo and Sega logos appearing at the same time when you first boot up some of the like F-Zero and some of those.
2064250	2064950	That was a huge event.
2065191	2065992	Yeah.
2066612	2067894	But a lot of people didn't know the difference.
2067914	2068614	We did the New Year's.
2068634	2069095	But it was huge.
2069215	2070817	The New Year's Bimani Countdown.
2070977	2071157	Yeah.
2072138	2073279	But it was good.
2073840	2075021	I'm glad that all worked out.
2075622	2075942	Anyhow.
2076743	2076983	Wow.
2077003	2078525	Didn't mean to get off on those topics.
2079005	2080245	We were back on talking about how we first met.
2080265	2082386	Let's grab a box of games.
2082826	2088567	Well, I got to Dan and me meeting and me moving out here and us, our children multiplying.
2089207	2090407	I'm sorry, our games multiplying.
2094368	2104729	But I really didn't though get my own group of friends until I started going to Golfland and playing in the arcades there because I was playing DDR at home already and Beatmania.
2104809	2107610	I had BM98 if you remember the old emulator.
2108411	2108751	One of Us!
2127132	2127392	Nice.
2128212	2131915	And then everything kind of exploded and our group just got huge.
2131975	2137780	And I had a birthday party at Golfland on the floor in front of the Fourth Mix.
2138502	2161151	I remember the day the fourth mix hit Golfland I actually called in sick well I was already I was like legitimately sick I called in because I was sick to work and then I found out that RVGL got fourth mix that day and I was like I'm going I don't even care that I'm sick I'm going I'm gonna go be one of the first people to play that machine and I was sick as a dog but I played it and I probably gave you all cooties although I do remember that I was the first person of us to play a max
2162735	2163156	How'd that work?
2163196	2164016	I was in San Diego.
2165117	2165237	Oh.
2165638	2170962	And the arcade there was like one of the few in SoCal that had it.
2171923	2172384	Very cool.
2172644	2172864	So.
2174345	2176887	Yeah, those Golf Land Nights used to be something else.
2177188	2177608	There they are!
2178068	2178849	Uh-oh, what'd you find?
2179970	2182312	DarkSakura's reaching for, what is this, Saturn games?
2182352	2183053	Dreamcast games.
2183593	2183973	Wrong!
2184033	2184614	TurboGrafx.
2186095	2186736	Oh, snap.
2187717	2188117	R-Type.
2190703	2191803	Oh yeah, I do have Space Harrier.
2192984	2193924	Welcome to Fantasy Zone.
2194744	2195084	Get ready.
2195964	2197325	40 bucks, according to the price tag.
2197425	2198005	When it was new.
2198865	2203566	Pac-Land, Ys 1 and 2, here's my Japanese games.
2204487	2206007	Twin Bee!
2208148	2209928	Some weird, bizarre shooter called Eldis.
2214029	2216270	Garou Densetsu 2, which is Fatal Fury.
2216410	2217410	Yeah, it's just Fatal Fury, right?
2218052	2218793	P.O.P.O.
2219833	2220294	P.O.P.O.
2221995	2223676	Strider, which we actually cannot play this game.
2224297	2224617	Why is that?
2224637	2225418	Well, it's sealed.
2225498	2226698	That might be one reason why you can't play it.
2226718	2227279	Oh, it's not sealed.
2227299	2228420	It's just... Oh, it looks like it.
2229080	2229781	In sticky paper.
2230081	2230641	Oh.
2230822	2235245	Because we do not have a system that we can use an arcade card in.
2236005	2236146	The...
2238727	2244171	One system that I really want... And listeners, if you want to band together and do this for me, I'll be your best friend forever.
2245332	2247654	I'm really trying to get a Duo RX.
2248175	2250957	Because it has the arcade card built into it.
2251958	2253239	They're about $150.
2253319	2255861	I mean, you can get them pretty affordable still.
2256562	2256742	But...
2258303	2259504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2281761	2283101	You guys made websites together.
2283121	2283941	That's so adorable.
2283981	2284962	Back on AOL.
2285262	2287322	Alan, why are we making websites together?
2287402	2288342	It's so precious.
2289362	2292043	It's called Neo... And I want to know if anyone remembers this.
2292063	2292883	He's shaking his head at me like, shut up.
2292903	2294023	I want to know if anyone remembers this.
2294083	2296024	It was called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.
2297684	2298824	And I touched up all of his graphics.
2299304	2303625	When I was a junior in high school, I had a Sailor Venus fan page on GeoCities.
2303885	2305105	You fag.
2305165	2305485	Yes.
2305705	2309786	Hey, my first cosplay was Sailor Venus.
2310686	2311506	She's the best one.
2313367	2314247	And then there's this.
2317449	2320630	It's the Holy Grail of the Castlevania.
2321090	2328373	I'm surprised you don't have this framed with laser beams that just cut you like the Resident Evil movie when you try to touch it.
2328513	2332335	Or like Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment trying to go through the laser beams.
2332695	2335116	The only thing I can read on this is Die Something Custom.
2337347	2338028	It's a tank game.
2338348	2342171	The port that just came out on the Wii, does it look like this or is it different?
2342692	2343852	I haven't tried it on the Wii yet.
2343933	2344513	We haven't got it.
2346655	2347415	I haven't bought it either.
2352960	2354061	All I know of those is die.
2354982	2360967	So anyway, die!
2361107	2362588	I see anime girlies on that one.
2362768	2363509	What's the one right there?
2363669	2365951	This is Valus 3.
2368021	2369783	and then, yeah, the rest of these are PlayStation.
2370504	2375869	Tempest X. I think we got a... These characters look familiar.
2375990	2378092	I think we got an American version of this at some point.
2378112	2378372	Yeah, we did.
2378833	2382657	Those are the N-A-M-C-O games on PlayStation that were all the Namco stuff.
2382677	2384919	And then wasn't there like a trademark symbol game that's really rare?
2384939	2385580	In Japan.
2385740	2386581	It's a restricted symbol.
2387021	2388423	And someone is supposed to be getting it for me.
2388803	2389063	Nice.
2389823	2390884	What's in it that's so special?
2409870	2421039	Pac-Man, Galaga, Pole Position, Bosconian, Rally X, New Rally X, and Toy Pop Xevious, Grappler, Super Pac-Man This was the one that was the hardest to find, was the A. Because I wanted Super Pac-Man.
2421520	2423702	Mappy, Grabda, and Dragon Buster.
2423742	2424783	You know we covered that story?
2425403	2427685	That said, oh, Grabda, we're gonna get it remixed.
2427745	2429667	I'm like, dude, it already came out in the US.
2431569	2434491	You could play this on the PS3, because they're playing PS1 games.
2434531	2436253	We had to get M as a greatest hits.
2436853	2440616	Dragon Spirit, Pac-Mania, and Legend of Valkyrie
2466545	2466766	Wow.
2476772	2477472	That was a fun game.
2503826	2507232	Why is it... What do you think made you such a gaming fan?
2507372	2513782	Like, why do you think you play video games and you love the games and the gaming culture, like, so much?
2515643	2516945	I practically grew up with it.
2517005	2518546	I mean, seriously.
2519347	2521850	I remember playing the Atari 2600 when I was a little kid.
2522911	2525474	I remember the Odyssey.
2526715	2527616	It's just always been there.
2528317	2531961	And it's always been a fun and kind of integral part of my life.
2531981	2533583	I hope that doesn't sound too sad.
2534243	2535885	But it's just always been there.
2537126	2539908	I don't think it's that because my story is somewhat similar.
2539928	2545151	I didn't like to go outside that much because I had asthma and allergies and everything and that and I hated everybody.
2545851	2547432	So, no I didn't.
2548092	2550974	But it was my form of escape.
2551014	2553075	And you know, my mom would play Nintendo with me.
2553755	2554816	She'd play the Nintendo.
2555196	2561040	And then when she was asking me for Christmas one time what to get my brothers, a Genesis or a Super Nintendo, I told her a Super Nintendo and then I played it the whole time.
2562140	2567123	So, but I mean, it's always been kind of, it's been sort of a bonding thing in my family a little bit.
2567563	2577249	And then when I was living in Alabama and playing games, I could play some things over the dial-up connection with friends in California.
2578210	2585534	And, you know, it just was my way of kind of getting out of how crappy Alabama was to live in.
2585934	2586674	I mean, at the time.
2587054	2588255	I'm not saying Alabama's crappy.
2588675	2589355	Don't get me wrong.
2589455	2591676	I love my home state, but I'd never want to live there again.
2592196	2599678	I just did not like being stuck with everyone expecting me to be one way when I was clearly something other than what they wanted me to be.
2600359	2603800	So, I would just play games all the time and kind of forget about it and then...
2605540	2607842	It instead expanded my life.
2608242	2610564	I met my husband because I loved anime and video games.
2611205	2611885	I moved out here.
2611945	2613026	We have a happy life.
2613206	2614507	I have a whole bunch of Transformers.
2616028	2622113	So, I mean, it's really, I think it's opened some doors in my otherwise lack of a social life.
2622974	2625235	And now I think I'm a lot more social than I used to be.
2625355	2627377	And I would say video games have a big part of it.
2628844	2635108	I wouldn't say that... I don't know if it was like a social thing because I would like to think I was still like kind of social when I was a kid.
2635128	2636329	You know, I had friends and all that stuff.
2636369	2641152	But I think like growing up especially, I was... You know, my brother and sister were so much older than I was.
2641192	2642773	My brother is 14 years older.
2642833	2644334	My sister is 16 years older than I am.
2644734	2647736	And my parents then are quite a bit older.
2647816	2649477	My mom was 37 when she had me.
2649558	2657383	So by the time I was around, not only did I have kind of the only child syndrome thing going on, but my parents had kind of done it all with my brother and sister.
2657423	2657923	You know, they didn't...
2658123	2658683	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2688155	2693479	And so I think the Commodore 64 kind of enabled me to gaming, even though we had an Atari 2600 that I played and all that other stuff.
2693839	2705749	But I just found myself like I was really able to entertain myself by like writing these little programs or typing them in for magazines and therefore feeling accomplished and, you know, trying to get these accomplishments in games and so forth.
2705789	2708591	And the games were sort of something I was able to get into.
2709071	2726962	and I felt like it was something I was kind of good at and that I was able to kind of like follow the scene sorry I'm just stretching I was able to like follow the scene pretty good and whereas like a lot of kids were really good at football or baseball or sports and things that I wasn't so good at I was good at games and I could kick their butt in any like video game and that was always like kind of cool
2727242	2727542	Busta Groove
2747293	2750515	So it was Busta Groove that actually got me into games.
2750935	2751755	In the music games.
2751895	2755337	And I know Jamie hates that because that's not what they were called, really.
2755777	2756698	But I didn't know any better.
2757058	2759940	Being somebody who didn't really follow the import gaming.
2760040	2761440	It was funny to laugh about it.
2762401	2765562	So we're trying to get the mics untangled as we move back to the studio.
2766983	2768124	We're playing mic roulette here.
2769136	2769216	D.D.R.
2792618	2797881	If you guys want to ask us some questions in chat, chat.orangelantradio.com Any types of follow-up or what have you.
2798301	2800842	I'm finally able to look at chat here again.
2802523	2803723	By the way, the G line should be up.
2803743	2804164	I'm trying.
2804224	2805284	So you should be able to get back in.
2805324	2806445	So let me know if you have success.
2807605	2808045	Let's see.
2809506	2813828	Blaze in our chatroom says, My mom used to whoop my butt in Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo.
2813848	2816709	See, my parents were never really into games at all.
2816990	2818790	I don't know.
2818830	2819291	My dad...
2820208	2822992	I think would try, but I don't think he was really into it.
2823012	2826817	He'd rather just take me mini-golfing or something and then I'd want to play games the whole time we were there.
2826837	2827698	I wouldn't want to really golf.
2830939	2831339	Let's see.
2831419	2833841	Toagak says Bust a Move is a game in the US.
2833901	2835062	Yeah, that was the whole problem.
2835142	2837043	It was Bust a Move was Puzzle Bobble.
2837404	2837644	Yep.
2837904	2840286	Which I think Puzzle Bobble is much cuter.
2840466	2841527	Yeah, it is.
2842367	2843708	So, all right.
2845049	2847391	So I think we're going to take, let's take like a quick, quick break.
2848011	2852255	And when we come back, we'll do some more news stories that we have listed and some of the other chat topics we have.
2852275	2852635	Okay.
2852655	2853215	Does that sound good?
2853335	2855037	And we got to think about what we're going to do for food too.
2855817	2857038	I think we're going to do a take and bake.
2857098	2857238	Right.
2857258	2858279	What time do those places close?
2859221	2860842	We'll see you next time.
2879671	2880271	We'll be right back.
2913334	2914255	4 1⁄2 hours in of our show tonight.
2938826	2939967	We had our main show earlier.
2940527	2946469	If you're tuning in expecting to hear Loki and the usual bits and all that, that started at 2 and finished at like 5.30.
2946930	2949291	So we're kind of in the extra stuff now.
2949551	2951532	We're broadcasting all night long because we can.
2952052	2953352	It looks like a lot of you guys are joining us.
2953372	2958835	I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangeentree.com which, yay, we're back in after all this time.
2958875	2959535	Thank you guys.
2960335	2962276	And Rama keeps having to remind me it's Sunday.
2962476	2963277	Did I say it's Saturday?
2963297	2963837	Yeah, my bad.
2964157	2965098	I don't know why.
2965138	2966398	I just really want it to be Saturday.
2966858	2967879	Because you have tomorrow off work.
2968399	2969520	DarkSakura actually made a phone call.
2969540	2970181	That's good to know.
2970201	2970741	I like that.
2970761	2971862	So we're doing what, pizza tonight?
2994901	2996663	Yes, the food of gamers.
2996783	3000748	That's right, the food of gamers and the food of marathons, actually, all things considered.
3001169	3003311	All right, hopefully DarkSakura got this.
3003351	3005694	I sent out a second show role full of other stories.
3005734	3006696	Hopefully you saw that in your...
3008698	3009038	Email?
3010299	3011679	That would be a good question.
3011819	3012259	Let me see.
3012279	3013000	Okay, take a look.
3013840	3017161	Because we're going to do some more stories for you guys.
3017181	3019562	Some things that actually missed the show role originally.
3020322	3021183	We'll talk about those.
3021203	3023624	And then we got more classic games of the week coming up.
3024184	3027785	And we'll take some of your Facebook questions in the segment as well.
3028186	3031147	They're going to do Ask Orange Lounge, I think, while I'm gone in the next segment.
3031367	3032727	And some other stuff too.
3032747	3033508	Oops.
3033588	3035428	Hey, how about...
3037609	3038670	More DDR music!
3039010	3040910	I think we heard enough of that during the break.
3040950	3041611	Sorry about that, guys.
3041731	3042571	I think I only got one.
3044012	3045012	No, I know I sent you one.
3045052	3045372	Take a look.
3045492	3045992	Oh, no.
3046112	3047653	It compressed.
3047673	3048013	There it is.
3048073	3048393	That's it.
3049194	3049754	Open up the attachment.
3049774	3049934	No, no.
3049994	3050614	Open up the attachment.
3050634	3050834	Down.
3050994	3051294	Down.
3051454	3051875	Supplement.
3052435	3052675	Okay.
3053035	3053415	There you go.
3053435	3054396	I don't want to download it.
3055696	3056036	There we go.
3056877	3057537	Yay.
3058517	3058877	Yay.
3058957	3060478	Does it let you click those links?
3061518	3061598	Yep.
3061658	3061778	Oh.
3062179	3062379	Yay.
3062519	3062739	Okay.
3063319	3064259	It's ugly, but it works.
3065200	3065500	All right.
3066932	3074185	And also, if you want to send us comments or whatever and chat along with us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
3074946	3076469	So happy we found our way back in the chat.
3077671	3078593	Alright, so DarkSakura!
3081027	3091850	Well, for firsties, for people who love Sonic Adventure, like me, on Xbox Live Arcade, it will be $10 as of September 15th.
3092530	3094591	And that's really, really sweet.
3095571	3104354	Sonic Adventure is probably one of my, in fact, the only probably good one of the three, you know, 3D ones, so I have to say that's pretty sweet.
3105394	3128626	and um apparently uh I just think this is funny and I want to read this from the article because I I snickered just now it's like we've contacted Sega to find out if the game will arrive on PSN on a similar timetable we also sent them an email with the subject line give us Seaman followed by a body of text which essentially read Seaman so
3129434	3131395	Are you going to be downloading this to check out and play?
3131455	3133375	Or are you like, screw this, I have the original.
3133475	3133875	Screw this game.
3133895	3135396	I'm kind of screw this, I have the original.
3135676	3135876	Yeah.
3135936	3137437	But at the same time, I would like to support it.
3138297	3141858	I sank so many hours into Sonic Adventure 2 for the Dreamcast.
3141918	3145819	And that's the one that had the little Tamagotchi Pokemon where you had your little babies.
3146619	3147580	The Sonic Adventure had them too.
3148240	3148460	Okay.
3148945	3151026	Imagine trying to play them in Japanese.
3151206	3155068	Oh, that's kind of sad, though, that you stopped playing after all that.
3177576	3186001	My first streamcast was Japanese, and we had Sonic Adventure, so trying to make myself read it, it was fun, but yeah.
3188702	3192905	Alright, well, another story for you guys about Xbox Live Arcade.
3193365	3196267	Crap, I linked myself to the wrong story, didn't I?
3197107	3197727	Son of a gun.
3197747	3200549	You need to talk more Sonic Adventure, I lost my story.
3203010	3205972	Okay, what was your favorite level in Sonic Adventure?
3207378	3208759	Running from the semi-truck.
3210760	3212121	That was Sonic, yeah, Sonic Adventure 2.
3212641	3215663	And then also, that's the same semi-truck that is in the beginning of Bayonetta.
3216423	3216703	Really?
3216863	3217063	Yeah.
3217224	3217924	Cool.
3218424	3223267	Actually, I love, in Sonic Adventure, it's the Sky Highway, or the Speed Highway.
3223680	3224280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3238931	3242874	Bungayoh HD is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.
3256664	3259267	You can break out into a sweat trying to dodge 5,000 bullets in 1080p.
3273263	3275183	Yes, and that's what Bangaio is all about.
3275523	3283065	My question is, though, if Bangaio is going like HD and all this, see, it's horizontal.
3283225	3284885	Wasn't Bangaio another vertical shooter?
3285505	3288986	Those don't translate too well into the HD because it's the wrong proportion.
3289446	3293827	Unless you were able to turn your HD TV like on its side, then it might work a lot better.
3293887	3294307	I don't know.
3294427	3296847	Well, they'll just have borders on the side like the final fight.
3297187	3298167	It always looks weird.
3298187	3301828	It always looks so weird because that's like half the screen with those games.
3303155	3315742	to make him well try playing well some games though like I remember Galactic Attack had a scrolling screen where you could scroll from side to side and it was just shorter and maintain your proportion
3317139	3317519	All right.
3318480	3320300	By the way, this is the other cool thing about the game.
3320340	3323562	It's got 100 levels in the game, so lots to play through.
3323622	3324282	But guess what?
3324782	3330664	If you finish all 100 levels and you decide, gosh, I need something new to play, use the level editor.
3331145	3335266	You're going to get to build your own levels and share them on Xbox Live.
3335546	3336347	That sounds like fun.
3336787	3337367	There you go.
3338087	3339068	Bunga is a fun game.
3339588	3339888	Mm-hmm.
3340508	3342889	So all this Dreamcast revival, good times.
3343670	3344250	Very good times.
3345490	3346351	It's full of happiness.
3346611	3346811	Mm-hmm.
3348675	3356862	Well, in other news, there is a game called Aero Cross High Air, the OFLC, the Australian rating thing.
3358263	3359764	It's one put out by Namco Bondi.
3360645	3368071	And it's actually the German USK rated Metro Cross High Air GP.
3371413	3376237	So looking this over, they're actually related, from what I can tell.
3382000	3382881	Sorry, I was looking this over.
3383661	3385382	No, you have to remember the stories in this segment.
3385582	3391505	We didn't really prep in advance at all, so it's going to be a little bit jankier than usual, but it's live radio.
3391525	3391946	What can you do?
3391966	3402411	Well, it's saying that Metro Cross is supposed to be like a redo of that 1985 Metro Cross that Namco put out, which is a side-scrolling foot race, and you avoid giant soda cans.
3404393	3405753	But what's Arrow Cross?
3406554	3406754	Hmm.
3406774	3406834	Hmm.
3407677	3410319	Those soda cans are as big as that guy's torso.
3410519	3411559	Those are huge.
3411759	3414001	In fact, the soda cans actually are as big as him, I believe.
3414461	3414701	Yeah.
3415802	3417823	Rob, can you jump over soda cans that are your size?
3418843	3419184	Probably not.
3419204	3420564	They look vaguely like Coke, too.
3421185	3421845	Oh, crap!
3425267	3426188	Wait, we're not to that story.
3426208	3428770	I know, I know, but...
3445603	3456380	One thing that Loki didn't mention during the show when he was talking about the iPhone and all those upgrades is that Apple also announced their big new social network this week called Ping Has anyone been using Ping?
3457462	3458364	Alan, have you used Ping?
3459136	3461538	I have no idea what it's going to offer me.
3478588	3490801	I was thinking at first like the way they were demoing it, I thought Ping was going to be this like awesome replacement for Facebook because it would be like Facebook but music oriented and then like no FarmVille or any of those games that are on Facebook.
3490901	3497628	And don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for FarmVille and Family Feud and Price is Right and all those Facebook games, but sometimes you don't want all that bullshit.
3498249	3499771	And I was also thinking that like, oh,
3500896	3501156	DarkSakura.com
3522330	3527573	You can't even write your own status update unless you're Lady Gaga or one of the famous people on there.
3527954	3533877	So it's like you can use it to follow famous people and then see what songs your friends are buying and make its own top ten list.
3533917	3536359	But otherwise, it's kind of like, what's the point?
3536459	3536859	I don't get it.
3536899	3542503	I'm sure that either her or her label is being... I mean, when she recommends an artist, I'm sure it's really from her.
3542603	3549287	But if you buy through the iTunes store, someone's making money for that referral for all the Gaga stans that buy what she says to buy.
3549727	3550468	and I'll see you next time.
3565470	3566970	But no, it's none of that.
3567191	3572232	It's just, hey, here's all the shit your friends are buying so you can make fun of them when they buy Spice Girls' greatest hits.
3573252	3575593	Although you really shouldn't make fun of that guy because that's probably me.
3575833	3576833	And you know what?
3577153	3577633	Stop hating.
3578474	3578734	All right.
3580254	3580674	Let's see.
3581275	3585296	Oh, Jessica Harper's in our chat, our good buddy from Under Station Live.
3585716	3588817	Well, that explains why she was at the Apple building a couple weeks back.
3588857	3589397	That's true.
3589437	3591978	When she was at San Jose, she was visiting the Apple building.
3592018	3592718	Now we know why.
3593718	3595379	She was getting her ping thing.
3596399	3596739	Ding.
3597159	3597439	Wing.
3598920	3600020	Lie.
3600080	3600501	Let's see.
3601041	3604262	Redertainment in chat says, iTunes has had Genius Mixes for a while now.
3604322	3608423	That's not a bad way to discover music, although it's your own music.
3608443	3612885	The Genius Mixes run off your own, at least as far as I've seen, it's your own music library.
3613165	3614025	But it's really cool.
3614045	3614646	Because I have a...
3615626	3618007	Like a lot of people, I have fairly eclectic music tastes.
3618367	3620528	Like, you know, I have some synth pop for those days.
3620648	3625009	I have some, you know, Alanis and, you know, Tori for my angsty lesbian days.
3625409	3627610	I have a variety of music in my collection.
3627690	3629911	But the Genius Playlist is a good way to kind of like separate it.
3630351	3634433	Like, I'll be like, okay, today I want to hear Tegan and Sarah and like everything that sounds like it.
3634553	3636913	And it'll kind of come up with a pretty decent mix.
3637994	3639514	So, I don't know.
3640355	3640655	Let's see.
3642035	3643577	iFarted in chat.
3644158	3645720	Yes, that's their name, iFarted.
3646140	3648783	Says, Sky secretly bought Milli Vanilli songs.
3648903	3649344	Admit it.
3649604	3650986	LOL.
3651526	3651987	I'll admit it.
3652047	3655951	I bought them back in 1990 or whenever they were actually out.
3656332	3657093	I think I had a single.
3657113	3659055	That was 91, so we were like...
3659455	3660196	I was in junior high.
3660636	3666663	I was actually quoted in the junior high paper during the whole debacle because they ran a story on it.
3666683	3672389	And I said something like, well, if they just released the names of the guys who really did it, I'd still buy their music.
3672469	3673310	It's cool.
3674491	3675052	Thanks for watching!
3704451	3706852	Like in retrospect, how obvious is their faking?
3707052	3708492	Like, for real?
3708632	3711433	These guys are supposed to have also had a good voice on their own.
3713833	3716014	You know, and they wanted to do their own stuff.
3716034	3716794	I need to hear the chorus.
3718655	3727997	They performed on an MTV Spring Break back when that was still going on and they actually used an actual LP for their lip sync and it skipped.
3729037	3730238	It was like an Ashley Simpson thing.
3730758	3730918	Yeah.
3731874	3752282	so they were doing their choreography and the girl you know it's true was stuttering because I guess they couldn't afford a cassette nice that's gotta be slightly embarrassing alright so let's go back to some gaming news I'm sorry I gotta shut off the Milli Vanilli for now Redertainment in our chatroom says I can't give a 14 year old shit watch me
3753973	3754393	That's true.
3754834	3758196	There's some little shits at, like, Golf Land sometimes.
3758256	3763779	And I'm like, the fuck I can't tell this kid what to do when he's, like, 14 years old and, like, thinks he's all, like, a badass.
3763839	3772424	It's like, um, you know, someday you're gonna, like, be unemployed and hating life and fathering tons of babies and, yeah.
3772765	3773085	I don't know.
3773345	3775686	My mom will roll you down with a Range Rover if you don't stop.
3775706	3776147	Exactly.
3777407	3779569	Alright, uh, hey, back to gaming news.
3779649	3781030	From Milli Vanilli to Mario.
3781550	3782250	Ha ha ha ha!
3783351	3783892	Super Mario Bros.
3783912	3784512	25th Anniversary
3808250	3817019	Mario All-Stars came back in 1993, and that was Mario, Mario 2, Mario 3, and the Lost Levels, which was really Japanese Mario 2.
3817780	3824387	In their cartridge, they got our Mario 2 as Mario USA, even though it was really Doki Doki Panic, and I've gone cross-eyed.
3825684	3838833	apparently the Wii reissue is going to have special packaging and there'll be a little booklet and a CD of Mario music that will include stuff from the original game all the way to Mario Galaxy 2 but no word if there are extra Mario games included with this
3840225	3841586	Game Boy Advance got special reissues of each one.
3863760	3864521	True, true.
3864882	3866744	Oh yeah, the Advanced, yeah.
3866825	3867666	Yeah, Mario Advanced.
3867706	3870770	I think Mario Advanced 2 is really Super Mario Bros.
3870790	3870770	3.
3870870	3874455	They were out of order, but they all got a GBA remake treatment.
3874836	3875637	They were really well done.
3875978	3878982	So I'm kind of curious, are we just going to be getting the same...
3881716	3883137	Super Nintendo Game Mario World
3905302	3905562	DarkSakura,
3926034	3928237	and I guess you are getting a CD full of music, whatever.
3928297	3933082	It just seems like there ought to be a little bit more to this or some extra Mario games or something.
3933122	3934784	I mean, come on, it's the Nintendo Wii.
3935285	3937447	You have a lot of extra space to do stuff, right?
3937467	3939590	Watch it not have classic controller support.
3940270	3940391	Ha!
3941071	3942252	Just because.
3943633	3945133	You gotta use the Wii stick sideways.
3945233	3946974	Well, if they put Mario World on it, that won't work.
3948095	3949015	Because there were four buttons.
3949035	3952797	You had the spinny jump and the... Let's see.
3953418	3959841	Y was run, B was jump, X was spinny jump, and A was... I think also fireball or something.
3959861	3961542	I don't think it did anything, really.
3962803	3963063	Anyhow.
3965273	3965873	Let's see.
3966634	3967794	Moving on, DarkSakura.
3968214	3970535	You were laughing at some pictures you brought up earlier.
3970675	3971436	What's this all about?
3972356	3973797	They're fantastically filthy.
3974317	3975938	At least I think they are.
3976258	3980419	It's these little additions that hook onto the Wii Remote.
3981500	3987643	They are put out by Mojo Wejo, and they are supposed to transform... Mojo Wejo!
3989204	3990546	This is a quote.
3990626	3996736	Able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals.
3998820	4000242	Ooh.
4000743	4002226	They're vibrators.
4003737	4006158	They are interesting looking violators.
4006178	4006958	They're will-dos.
4007378	4008678	They're we-dildos.
4008858	4009678	They're we-dos.
4009818	4010219	We-dos.
4010679	4011219	We-dos.
4011339	4014199	I have to show you chat room and I want to see what you think about this.
4016840	4020201	Would this be a turn-on or a total buzzkill?
4021061	4025042	One of them looks like something you would use to pick up radioactive material.
4025102	4027423	Like, it doesn't even really look like... What's that supposed to do?
4027503	4028723	Like, pinch things?
4028863	4029123	Oh, no.
4029183	4030463	I bet it's for fapping.
4032044	4032584	Oh, wow.
4033944	4034845	Seriously, look at it.
4035666	4039428	It would be an adjustable little clamp that goes around your... It's the claw.
4041930	4043191	Is it adjustable sizes?
4043231	4044932	Because, you know, I need extra large.
4047814	4048495	Why are you laughing?
4049075	4051997	I just looked over and saw Ellen give you a sideways look.
4057021	4058261	But at any rate, yeah.
4058862	4059562	You know what, though?
4059722	4060183	One of these...
4063062	4065264	I don't think that I find that attractive.
4067086	4072090	Does it come with Purell?
4072491	4075594	I don't think that a Wiimote would give off enough oomph.
4078456	4079577	Yeah, I don't know.
4079637	4081239	What games are you going to be able to play with that?
4081279	4082039	That's what I want to know.
4082420	4085923	What's just some housewife with a big grin on her face flailing around the living room?
4085943	4086804	It's like, what are you doing?
4086824	4088145	It's like, oh, I'm playing WarioWare.
4090754	4093095	But your hands are free, yeah.
4094235	4097276	I'm playing the ping pong ball shooting level.
4097656	4100216	This is what it says on the Mojo Weejo website, okay?
4101557	4105058	The device is attached to the accessory port on a Nintendo Wii remote control.
4105478	4109859	The control is then connected to a Bluetooth-enabled PC running Mojo Weejo software.
4110279	4114000	Using the Mojo Weejo patent-pending Motion 2 Vibration technology...
4114500	4142450	the device is able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals and send them to another selected device in the same room or over the internet Wii gaming console not required essentially turning your Wii remotes into shared remote controlled vibrators aka Wii vibrator or Wii brater that's from it kind of reminds me of the original there's a video oh wow there's a video to this oh hooray
4143769	4146010	Wait, I should play this over here so we can get the audio over the feed.
4146031	4146231	Hold on.
4146251	4147511	I've got my sound turned off.
4147632	4148252	Alright, that's okay.
4148272	4150774	We're going to play this over the feed here.
4151114	4151654	Where am I going?
4152255	4152575	Oh, here?
4152855	4153656	The link?
4154376	4156778	Yeah, follow the link to SF Weekly.
4156838	4157458	Okay.
4160560	4163542	I don't know if this has sound.
4164042	4164943	It's just kind of doing its thing.
4167133	4169414	It's drawn a little unhappy face.
4169454	4170394	That's not really unhappy.
4170434	4171235	That's the meh.
4171275	4173836	Now it's like, I'm super happy!
4174076	4178818	Because I'm playing the Nintendo Wii, but I have this box that says Mojo Weejo.
4179578	4183420	And now my Wii has a little accessory that I shake.
4184580	4185761	It's making a little shaky thing.
4187441	4189022	I'm waiting for something interesting to happen here.
4189762	4190223	What's it doing?
4190283	4191823	It's transmitting to the computer.
4193184	4195745	Then it's transmitting back to the Wii mode and it starts shaking.
4196403	4198483	and now the eyes are turning all different colors.
4198563	4200064	That is kind of scary.
4200424	4201484	You know what it looks like?
4201684	4205245	From what I'm getting on here, it's for cybering.
4205385	4206625	It's for cyber sex.
4207265	4209826	It runs off the Bluetooth in your computer.
4209886	4210566	That's what it is.
4210686	4211766	It's just using the Wiimote.
4212427	4213567	Hey, who doesn't have a Wiimote?
4214007	4214887	So here's what you do.
4216227	4217508	I'm just explaining this like I know.
4217928	4218628	You get on your...
4219048	4225003	You get on your PC and you find someone you want to do some naughty things with online.
4225324	4228151	And then you take the Wiimote and put on the attachment and...
4230399	4231980	You know, attach it.
4232501	4237945	And then you go on the chat room and you put like, oh baby, I am so hot right now.
4238205	4239126	Like, push the button.
4239226	4241047	And then they push the button and you're like, ooh.
4242188	4252216	Instead of typing, I am having so much trouble typing right now, it'd be like you, you know, V-E-R-Q, it'd be all scrambled.
4252796	4256379	And then you'd have to get one of those little plastic covers for your monitor.
4262490	4267616	You remember when people always had the little plastic covers for their keyboard and everything, and we used to just call it the Jizz Guard.
4268797	4270039	Splash Zone.
4270059	4270379	Good times.
4272422	4274124	Or you just play Rez with it, honestly.
4274184	4276086	That's really what it's made for, so yeah.
4277912	4302667	You have amused Tara with your explanation Good, good Alright Well, speaking of sensual video games The Wii Balance Board is now supported in a massage game Oh, you're gonna love this, DarkSakura Called Love Press Plus Plus This looks like the type of massage game that has happy endings Not the type of massage you paid good money to go to school to learn
4305034	4317550	It's going to be shown off this month at the Tokyo Game Show 2010 It's a massage game called Love Press Press It's by Shirai Labs and it uses massage recognition to stimulate the physical communication of lovers
4321397	4322458	Right.
4322698	4326580	You choose a virtual partner and you can pick from various shapes and ages.
4327280	4328981	Although I somehow doubt there's old fatties.
4332123	4336165	The shapes are skinny and skinnier probably and the ages are like young or 18.
4337206	4338006	No gilfs.
4338186	4340768	Because like real people don't ever be in these games.
4341668	4342249	Creepy.
4342329	4342570	Wow.
4361363	4362263	There's actually an announcement.
4362283	4362803	You know what, Rob?
4362863	4364344	There has to be one line in that game.
4366124	4370866	Look, here's this guy playing the game and it just looks like he's having anal sex with a balance board.
4370886	4372526	It's really what it looks like to me.
4372946	4374246	I mean, tell me I'm wrong.
4374867	4375167	No.
4375287	4377127	But he's having anal sex with a balance board.
4377147	4379268	Link that in the chat room and put it to a quick vote.
4379768	4382129	Okay.
4382269	4383389	Quick poll in our chat room.
4383409	4384849	Anal board sex.
4385089	4386350	Go to the following link.
4386530	4388570	Is that man having wee board sex?
4388850	4389370	Anal sex.
4389411	4389711	Hold on.
4390071	4390931	Let me type that in bold.
4395615	4395975	I vote too.
4400317	4402538	Maybe the longer we broadcast, the dirtier we get.
4402598	4402959	I don't know.
4403699	4404079	I don't know.
4404239	4408601	Some hospitals in Japan are going to get way more weird emergency room visits than they're used to.
4410042	4413744	It pinches!
4414084	4415084	But you see what he's doing?
4415104	4418446	He's massaging the board like it's supposed to be somebody's back.
4419358	4425667	Okay, okay, now this actually goes to something which is kind of a recent, and I've actually been reading sociological articles about this.
4426127	4428510	That there's been this... About this?
4428751	4429892	No, it has to do with it.
4430012	4431394	Anal sex with rebalance boards?
4431414	4432155	It has to do with it.
4432195	4432856	You read a lot.
4434438	4435199	Hi, it's me.
4435299	4437220	If there's information to be learned, I learn it.
4438861	4451550	But it's actually been this big, and they've been interviewing people who are becoming less and less outwardly social, preferring to stay at home more often, who basically don't want sex.
4452351	4454993	Want, I guess, companionship, but not like with a real person.
4456054	4457535	Like this one guy married his doll.
4458826	4460267	Also the guy who married the DS, right?
4460327	4461547	Well, the only guy who married his DS.
4461607	4463848	But it's been this social thing lately.
4463868	4465428	I was looking up some stuff about birth rates dropping.
4474432	4478796	And they had that as a link in regards to birth rates dropping in Japan.
4480137	4484901	And I was like, well, you know, isn't this just what we hear about, you know, kind of, you know, fringe behavior?
4484921	4485722	It's not the norm.
4486163	4491007	But apparently it's becoming either more of a trend or more of a public knowledge type thing.
4491187	4494530	So this totally doesn't surprise me.
4496744	4501753	Sorry, I'm just looking at this because they actually put on here, they put tweet love press to give your comments.
4502394	4505279	I'm trying to see what comments, but it's all... We have a new president, Kat.
4505539	4506221	Hey, wait a minute.
4506361	4506521	Like...
4507532	4510893	All the results are more than two days old.
4512534	4514595	We don't have enough people tweeting Love Press.
4514755	4516256	I think we need to change that.
4518477	4521398	It looks like everybody has tweeted Love Press two days ago.
4521638	4528941	And Red Entertainment, yes, I am very familiar with the term, and I wasn't going to bring that up, but that's actually been, again, coming up.
4529121	4529722	Asexuality.
4530002	4530162	Yes.
4531042	4537447	So, I think you guys need to tweet about the love press and, you know, how you can't wait for the anal sex Wii balance board game.
4537827	4539729	Alright, the results of our quick poll are in.
4540149	4540930	Here we go, let's see.
4541390	4543231	Yes, I'm sorry, the quick poll again.
4543392	4545553	Is that man giving anal sex to the balance board?
4546274	4546954	Yes, he is.
4547215	4548235	Yes, yes, yes.
4548435	4549696	That's some butt sex right there.
4550077	4551158	Yes, yes, frown.
4551338	4552318	Oh, baby, oh, baby, yes.
4552699	4553920	Sadly, yes, he is, guys.
4553980	4554560	Goes blind.
4555041	4557042	On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm gonna fuck you now.
4558483	4560245	He's friending the Wii's, you know...
4560845	4561345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4578812	4579753	Again, you need to tweet.
4579813	4582675	Right at the bottom of that page it says tweet Love Press to give your comments.
4582695	4587358	So I would like our listeners to send their comments on the Love Press over to the makers of the game.
4587378	4589239	They're waiting to hear your comments on Love Press.
4589400	4593803	If you take a towel and wrap it up and press it down on there, does it then become a waterboarding simulator?
4598666	4598986	I don't know.
4600047	4600647	It's a good question.
4601548	4602589	Alright, so there you go.
4602649	4604130	There's another sensual game.
4604170	4605631	But it's not sexual.
4605671	4608253	It's just going to teach you how to massage.
4608846	4610787	You know I hate the term happy ending, by the way.
4611167	4612828	I know you do, which is why I say it all the time.
4612928	4616731	That is not... I'm not going to get on my high horse about this.
4617791	4619072	Hold on, but I have two questions.
4620813	4623855	Is it something that would typically be done at the end of the session?
4624495	4624815	Yes.
4625676	4627317	Is it going to make the recipient happy?
4627957	4628317	Yes.
4628938	4630659	Therefore, it's a happy ending.
4632904	4652134	I know it's all offensive and shit to massage people who take the art of massage very seriously, but... Well, on top of that, it's the other reason why we're running into all this legislation going around now trying to put police officials on the board of massage therapists in California who know nothing about it.
4652374	4659678	As gamers, they're trying to say that M-rated games shouldn't be sold unless they have all these restrictions or games are porn and all this stuff.
4659698	4660158	Blame the man.
4660258	4661018	Stick it to the man.
4661259	4661739	That's right.
4662299	4668901	Have you seen DarkSakura, the YouTube where this masseuse is like, oh, would you like happy ending?
4668941	4669841	And the guy says, yeah.
4669881	4673081	And all of a sudden, like, balloons fall out of the sky and clowns come out.
4673201	4675042	And they're like, yay!
4675622	4678623	He's like in his towel clapping, like, yay!
4678763	4679403	I should see that.
4679443	4681063	That sounds... Now that's funny.
4682584	4684164	That sounds entirely too amusing.
4684844	4685645	Do you know how to find that?
4685685	4686746	Do you know what I would look up?
4687886	4688687	We got a marathon show.
4688707	4689468	I can look up YouTubes.
4689528	4689908	It's fine.
4690028	4691369	Happy ending parody?
4691489	4691989	I don't know.
4693431	4694792	I could probably tell what it is from the cap.
4696993	4697213	No.
4697954	4698334	This one?
4698675	4700876	Happy ending massage HD uncut original version?
4701076	4701437	Is that it?
4702237	4703298	This girl's got big titties.
4705280	4706460	Now I want to just see this one.
4706520	4709843	I don't... Mute it in case it's not it.
4710443	4710984	Hold on.
4711324	4712525	I'm just going to mute that a little bit.
4714594	4716155	Oh, this is like softcore right here.
4716195	4716735	That's hot.
4716816	4717196	Look at her.
4717676	4718757	Dang.
4719417	4720758	This is awesome radio, by the way.
4721138	4721679	I just want to say.
4722579	4724501	That's because we're amazing people.
4724721	4725081	Orange Lounge.
4725101	4725601	Oh, no, it is.
4725621	4725981	This is it.
4726002	4726402	This is it.
4726642	4726882	Yeah.
4727783	4728823	Orange Lounge Cinemax.
4728923	4729344	Okay, hold on.
4729364	4729624	Hold on.
4730024	4730965	You have to watch this, DarkSakura.
4735608	4735948	Look at that.
4736008	4736548	Massaging his...
4738266	4738566	Feet?
4739547	4740048	Look at that.
4743530	4745372	Is that the type of outfit you wear when giving massages?
4746113	4746433	No.
4747854	4749996	I'm a fan of sweatpants and a t-shirt.
4750016	4752818	There's a sign, therapeutic massages only, no police allowed.
4763428	4764429	You want happy endings?
4808506	4809207	You happy now?
4811107	4813449	Well, it really wasn't what I was hoping for.
4814149	4815029	Oh, no.
4816070	4820552	Maybe you want a handjob.
4820692	4820552	$50.
4820852	4823193	For a handjob, right?
4823614	4826095	Yeah, handjob.
4826115	4827095	Yeah, okay.
4828296	4828556	Okay.
4830817	4831698	Handjob!
4838700	4840021	And they're all in grease outfits.
4840061	4840881	That's fantastic.
4842222	4843082	He's doing it too.
4847824	4848785	That was amazing.
4849725	4851786	Thank you, Ellen, for bringing that into my life.
4853287	4854007	I like that in chat.
4854027	4855948	Oh, chat room, how you have missed out.
4856368	4860570	For those listening on the podcast, YouTube user is Mediocre Films.
4861391	4862651	There it is, Mediocre Films.
4862871	4864712	And it's called Happy Ending Massage.
4865653	4866373	It was brilliant.
4867978	4870719	I'm trying to look at a stop motion movie.
4897771	4898912	Okay, this I've got to see.
4898992	4902536	And yeah, we haven't rehearsed any of this, so I'm trying to see what this was.
4904838	4909744	It's a stop motion animation of somebody doing Kirby's Adventure in yarn.
4913407	4913988	I'm going to quote this.
4914609	4916450	Okay, it came from...
4919059	4925643	The original idea came from staff at Goodfeel, which was inspired by a stop animation film made primarily with yarn, explains Ellis.
4925723	4926924	I'm reading off Destructoid.
4927524	4935909	With the ability for players to interact with the game's environment, such as unzipping the background panels, Kirby's Epic Yarn is really its own category as a platformer.
4936489	4945074	So, and they're saying that nobody at Nintendo of America knew what it came from, so I'm seeing if this is perhaps the...
4947682	4953927	Yeah, this was a stop-motion animation commercial that came out in Japan for Kirby's Adventure.
4955248	4956969	All done with yarn.
4956989	4958070	Oh yeah, it's got that yarn style.
4958370	4958971	That's kind of cool.
4959871	4960552	It's really cute.
4961473	4963514	Isn't it amazing what the internet will unearth?
4963594	4967037	Like, if you have an unoriginal idea, at some point the internet will find it.
4967377	4967998	You know what I mean?
4968138	4969599	Man, Kirby sure sucks.
4971020	4971680	No, he does, though.
4974144	4974324	Aw.
4976185	4977786	Why don't we get cute commercials like that, Rob?
4978186	4979127	Explain it to me, please.
4979287	4980387	You're not watching enough cartoons.
4981248	4982968	No, we don't have cool commercials anymore.
4983889	4985330	How does a hipster play Kirby?
4986370	4986630	How?
4986870	4989592	Without inhaling any powers because it's a pure experience.
4991312	4992493	Ha ha ha ha ha.
4993253	4993673	Alright.
4993974	4996555	Do you want to do that story on the third night's game you skipped over?
4997095	4997375	I did.
4997515	4998896	Did you do that one?
4999676	5001237	I opened everything up in order.
5002113	5003655	Did I link the same story twice?
5003915	5004616	Ah, crap.
5005057	5006358	No, I just linked the same thing twice.
5007019	5007560	Sorry about that.
5007640	5008361	Skip that story then.
5008561	5009142	I'll do these two.
5009462	5010383	Oh, so yeah.
5010463	5011485	Yeah, it's the wrong link.
5011545	5012186	I screwed up.
5012246	5012786	Blah, blah, blah.
5013027	5014108	Well, thanks, Rob.
5014128	5014609	You're welcome.
5015660	5017141	Well, now you gotta do two stories in a row.
5017442	5017742	Fine.
5018223	5018663	I'll do three.
5018683	5018823	Fine.
5019304	5019524	Fine.
5019584	5019884	Do it.
5019964	5021426	I don't care.
5021446	5021426	007.
5022146	5027292	A slew of pre-order items for GoldenEye 007 coming out on the Wii.
5027752	5034319	GameStop, if you get the game there, you're gonna get Invisibility Mode will be unlocked in the game for split-screen multiplayer.
5035019	5039184	Each player will be invisible for a set amount of time, allowing you to sneak up on each other.
5039804	5040684	Thanks for watching!
5055129	5082012	but then I don't know what happens with that so maybe they're going to I don't know if they're codes you put into the game which will end up on the internet everywhere or if it's some type of DLC which doesn't make sense because Nintendo Wii doesn't do a lot of DLC although there's some like the Final Fantasy 4 game has some DLC in it but yeah that's strange oh by the way if you get the game at Walmart you get a t-shirt that says cheater with an odd job hat
5082572	5084174	Now that you can't get with a code.
5084214	5087157	So I hate to say it, but Walmart seems to be the best place to get this game.
5089159	5089619	So there you go.
5089639	5091021	A little odd job hat says cheater.
5091041	5093904	Well, that's because anyone who uses odd job is a cheap bitch.
5094504	5096867	No, odd job is awesome and you just can't deal with it.
5097347	5097647	All right.
5099229	5099750	By the way,
5100492	5102554	Martin Hollis I imagine it's a business decision, isn't it?
5102574	5103355	This name is valuable.
5103375	5103735	Let's use it.
5117890	5122913	I find it hard to picture Activision's top management being excited about the original and wanting to do it justice.
5123333	5126415	In fact, I find it hard to imagine them being excited about any game.
5126795	5129817	It's my perception that they are trying to be EA, only more so.
5130157	5134619	I think they're doing a fine job with that.
5134979	5135660	I know, right?
5136360	5137941	He's a little irritated there.
5138641	5141623	Now, he does say nice things about the developers themselves.
5141683	5144845	He says, quote, they are a good company.
5145005	5146726	I'm confident they've done their very best.
5148422	5149482	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5178255	5185738	It's a first-slash-third-person shooter that originally came out in 2005, and you took on the role of the Stranger.
5186499	5188499	But it was kind of like an Oddworld type of game.
5188539	5192821	You used ammo, animals, bugs to actually take out enemies.
5193581	5198864	It's going to have updated visuals to 720p, updated graphics, updated music and all that stuff.
5199244	5201845	The dialogue in the game is also being remastered.
5203759	5216863	Is this the... I remember the last Odyssey game that came out where you're a cowboy where you're actually a cow and you're shooting enemies first-person shooter style and I remember it bombed horribly.
5216943	5217663	Is that what this is?
5217763	5218183	Remade?
5219404	5220684	But you're not a cow, I don't think.
5221184	5222145	No, it doesn't look like it.
5222225	5223305	Like a moose or something?
5223625	5224485	Someone in chattel now.
5224545	5227066	How is a cow like a moose?
5228066	5229567	They're both big and stinky.
5231838	5232138	All right.
5232599	5234841	Well, it's going to be 720p and all that good stuff.
5234941	5236683	They are targeting an Easter release.
5236883	5240406	One other thing that they're putting in the game, PlayStation Move support.
5240866	5243189	So it's almost like a whole different game from what it used to be.
5243209	5244390	Is it the Move?
5246131	5247072	With what Alan said.
5247112	5247512	Shut up.
5250916	5252517	I can't stop!
5253700	5253940	DarkSakura?
5283090	5285251	Oh, I was just thinking about pizza.
5286532	5288673	We'll take a break here in a minute and do the pizza stuff.
5289534	5294297	Well, as far as there's news for DJ Hero 2.
5294957	5298559	The RZA is in the cast of DJ Hero 2.
5299400	5304243	As in, dude from Wu-Tang Clan who also likes to put out kung fu movies.
5306764	5311387	They've actually got images for his costume up here and I'm pulling those up to have a good look at them.
5313311	5313771	Pretty cool.
5314552	5318454	Yeah, that's him being motion captured for the game, so that's actually pretty cool.
5318974	5329079	So yeah, fully digitized, gonna be in the game, and I'm just double checking to see if there's any other tracks.
5329119	5330880	I'm entranced by the Ice Cream Truck music.
5330920	5331280	Ice Cream Man!
5331560	5332061	Ice Cream Man!
5332281	5332801	Ice Cream Man!
5332941	5333621	He's right there.
5333841	5334582	Is he right out front?
5334602	5340545	I know it's kind of weird that it started showing up in the last year or so that Ice Cream Truck's been driving by.
5341082	5364001	LL Cool J's I Can't Live Without My Radio and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's The Message and then the other one is Damian Marley's Welcome to Jamrock and Walter Murphy's A Fifth of Beethoven which was on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack which I have two copies of on vinyl
5364898	5365478	Because you're weird.
5366139	5368480	I got my mom's and my uncle's copies each.
5368821	5369281	It's all good.
5371503	5375125	And then there's also a Dollars and Cents BlackRock track for the game, too.
5376026	5380449	But I just thought it was funny because the other article mentioned the other game that he had been motion captured in.
5380489	5382790	And you know what that was, Rob?
5382890	5385532	Wu-Tang Shaolin style fighting game for PS1.
5385732	5387633	Oh, God, I remember that game.
5388014	5388334	Yeah.
5388374	5390996	Yes, it was like, oh, God, it was like the new Shaq Fu.
5392259	5393420	But it wasn't really all that bad.
5393900	5397143	Remember that Def Jam, the rap fighting game?
5397203	5398304	There was one of those too?
5398745	5399205	Oh man.
5401047	5402829	A lot of interesting stuff.
5403297	5404979	All right, Mega Man Universe.
5405059	5409944	More information was supposed to come out of PAX this week, but I don't remember seeing anything additional on this.
5410004	5411946	Maybe somebody in chat can fill us in on this.
5412326	5412686	Here's the thing.
5412706	5424018	There was a story saying that more Mega Man Universe information was going to be coming out because apparently they were giving away some little things that look like, I don't know, like little, I don't know what those are supposed to be.
5425779	5426240	Are those like
5429611	5430334	DarkSakura.com
5438274	5439494	Like little pillows or something.
5439574	5440975	Oh yeah, they just look like little pillows.
5441935	5445675	The Ryu is kind of funny, but the Rockman looks actually pretty cool.
5446596	5460658	So apparently some of the stuff at Capcom's booth was supposed to be showing Mega Man Universe with more trailers and game levels, Ghost Trick, Okamiden, Resident Evil 5, Bionic Commando Rearm 2, da da da.
5461159	5463359	I haven't seen a whole lot of information since then.
5463459	5464260	How about, how about I...
5492151	5493812	Ah, stinking trailers.
5494653	5499297	Okay, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
5499557	5501839	Okay, are we ready?
5502220	5504442	No, we have to go by the sponsor message real quick.
5505623	5506924	No, it's nine seconds, we're good.
5507564	5509286	I totally forgot whose level I was doing.
5509706	5511888	Oh, Metal Man, I think.
5512169	5512609	Okay, here we go.
5515812	5518134	ESRB, da-da-da, who cares, shut up.
5520307	5525348	Capcom logo Aren't you all pretty now?
5525999	5530903	Hi, I'm the creator of Mega Man.
5531023	5539509	A lot of people who saw the first Mega Man Universe trailer are confused about wondering how this game will play.
5541630	5545993	Since the trailer didn't reveal all that much, we want to know you, jerk.
5546333	5548955	I'm here to clear up the confusion.
5549055	5550436	That's right.
5550456	5551677	The first playable video
5554679	5555939	and you can see how it actually works.
5556020	5556740	Show me already!
5560061	5562342	I hope this video gets you excited and has you looking forward to more.
5563462	5563762	Hurry up!
5563882	5565503	Why are you mad, though?
5566723	5568704	There we go.
5569324	5569945	In your arm!
5570625	5571645	Play us, Rockman.
5580368	5581469	Ooh, the graphics look cool.
5584761	5585842	Wait, isn't that Metal Man's stage?
5585862	5586402	Yes, it is.
5589805	5590846	That's Fire Man's stage.
5591947	5592847	This is the select music.
5593027	5594528	This is the character select music.
5595129	5595990	Well, the stage select.
5599332	5600773	And that's Crash Man's level.
5600833	5602695	Dude, this is like Mega Man 2 redone.
5603876	5604436	Oh, that's new.
5604996	5606257	A level that says Mega Man.
5607598	5607819	That's...
5614181	5615462	Play as Ryu.
5616122	5616982	No way.
5619023	5621064	You are Megafight.
5622125	5624185	He says you're World Megafight.
5624345	5629968	Okay, so some of the gameplay looks very Mega Man, but then you see this random Ryu.
5631789	5632609	What is that all about?
5632669	5633690	I gotta see if there's more.
5634970	5635991	Are these all just the same?
5638292	5639472	It's all the same trailer, I think.
5641093	5643254	Oh no, they all got different gameplay trailers.
5644119	5644499	Ooh!
5646300	5648781	It's like different websites got different gameplay trailers.
5650662	5651823	It's like that's Woodman's level.
5652023	5653904	Dude, it's like a Mega Man 2 upgrade.
5653924	5656385	Plus some, I think.
5656405	5662648	I'm gonna play as Ryu, no way.
5662708	5665950	I wanna see, like, actual one that actually shows.
5665970	5667511	Let's see what this trailer has in it here.
5670312	5671713	I think they're all gonna be Mega Man.
5672633	5673514	Oh my god, really?
5676750	5679631	Hi, there's no controls in that one.
5679671	5681251	I do admit that he's actually really cute.
5681291	5684392	Alright, I'm not going to play that third one because we can't skip through it.
5685392	5687393	Alright, so it's a Mega Man type of game.
5688573	5690893	Oh, so we say there's a triple video out there.
5693354	5694634	I'm looking at our chat room there.
5696835	5698435	It shows all three side by side.
5698735	5699856	Well, let's see if I can get that.
5702376	5702696	Why not?
5702736	5704877	We have extra time because of the marathon show.
5704937	5705397	I'm going to do...
5708388	5711510	Universe Triple Video.
5711530	5713531	Okay, Mega Man Universe Triple Video.
5715052	5715512	I don't see it.
5717373	5720175	I see official teaser trailer, which is that same thing we saw before.
5721336	5723377	This is wonderful radio.
5723597	5724257	Oh, shush.
5728580	5733102	You would think that they would have actual footage that's shown up from PAX, but I guess not.
5734343	5735524	Maybe it's not out there on the floor.
5735584	5735884	I don't know.
5737828	5738649	Alright, well, whatever.
5739170	5739630	I'm over it.
5740391	5741472	Let's move on to some more news.
5741492	5743714	We'll get more information on this in the coming weeks, I'm sure.
5747138	5747679	DarkSakura.
5748920	5749681	Other news!
5750842	5753705	How about EA actually trying to cover their ass?
5755683	5761406	They're basically trying to defend their whole stupid little online pass deal.
5762087	5766630	And there's a quote out here put by EA Sports dude Peter Moore.
5767850	5774174	Digital delivery, maintaining servers able to support that volume of people every 24 hours, a solid billing infrastructure and customer support.
5774514	5777376	It all takes time, effort, and money, and we're at the cutting edge of that.
5777836	5783499	Online pass is a way of bringing more digital experiences quicker from day one, getting people new content.
5785401	5787502	Yeah, they're just saying, this shit costs money.
5787723	5788503	We need more of it.
5789484	5789904	The end.
5790024	5791065	Yeah, we all need more money.
5791125	5791886	I want more money.
5792026	5796089	EA should give me $10 because I need to have money to buy their games.
5796109	5797630	They'd have to pay me to play their games.
5798231	5801953	I mean, well, not for Sims 3, but like for, you know, sports games.
5804235	5804936	You know what they need?
5805696	5810420	They need, EA needs to put out Wii Figure Skating and you use the balance board.
5812543	5815788	and you have to balance to do all the tricks right on there with your Wiimotes in your hand.
5815948	5817030	That sounds hard.
5817691	5818412	That would be amazing.
5818793	5819274	I'd play that.
5819858	5823501	Speaking of amazing, this is probably the most amazing news story we've had all week.
5824001	5828524	Commodore USA is going to be making modern PCs, but in replica cases.
5828644	5830285	And I think that is, like, so badass.
5831406	5846476	Apparently, the Commodore PC-64 will actually have an Intel Atom 535 processor with NVIDIA Ion 2 graphics, 4 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM, a terabyte hard drive, and a DVD-ROM, optionally upgradable to Blu-ray.
5846996	5847877	That is so hot.
5848437	5849418	I actually kind of want one.
5850158	5853141	But it's in a Commodore 64 replica case so you can party like it's 1983.
5853821	5857504	That's pretty cool.
5858465	5859365	Not a lot else with that.
5859405	5860966	I don't see a price though.
5861007	5862908	That's the one thing I'd like to see is a price.
5863969	5864749	Let me see.
5865150	5866731	Nope, of course they don't say what it is.
5866771	5869353	I'm looking at the original press release here to see what it looks like.
5870848	5871308	DarkSakura
5893223	5894204	Well, I have different news.
5895704	5899146	There was a game that the Burnout developers were going to be making, and do you know what that was?
5900186	5900967	Skate or Die.
5901267	5902147	Do you remember Skate or Die?
5903148	5903668	I sure do.
5903768	5904008	Yes.
5905669	5914073	They were going to do it GTA style, apparently, instead of just having it be all tricks and stuff.
5914093	5917094	That would have been kind of cool.
5917114	5918094	I wonder why they canned it.
5918114	5921396	Did they talk about why it got canned or why they decided not to do it or what happened?
5922250	5931273	Well, EA and Criterion basically got on each other's asses again, and so Criterion then went to do Need for Speed.
5933814	5937015	And it just looks like it just kind of fell through the cracks.
5938256	5938936	That sucks.
5939236	5940237	That could have been kind of cool.
5940297	5941637	I remember Ski or Die.
5942457	5944018	That was the quote-unquote sequel.
5944807	5955851	My BFF in grade school used to get blisters on the palm of his hands, like really gross blisters from playing Skate or Die on his PC, his IBM.
5956731	5958371	And then I guess I think it was the half pipe.
5959012	5962333	You had to roll your palm across the number pad to do the flips.
5962713	5963973	He used to get blisters from that game.
5964373	5964973	Oh my gosh.
5965353	5965934	Cool story, bro.
5967509	5968390	That just sounds nasty.
5968710	5971493	The one I remember, it wasn't Skate or Die.
5971533	5975737	I remember quite as fondly as I do 720, which was Atari's skating game.
5975777	5976798	Did you play this, Bradley?
5976898	5977358	Yes, yes.
5977378	5977959	I played it a bunch.
5978299	5980621	That's where you get chased by bees if you're not fast enough.
5980661	5984465	I actually got to play it again at California Extreme.
5984545	5985025	Oh, yeah?
5985646	5990050	Yeah, that was like a hand killer just because spinning the controller a bunch.
5990836	5992658	Yeah, because it was all trackball, right?
5992938	5994879	No, no, it's a controller that goes around in a circle.
5995020	6002366	Oh, that's right, yeah, the controller's like, but it doesn't stand up, like it's always tilted in one way, so it's really weird to control.
6002746	6012314	Yeah, well, that's the direction you go in when you skate, so you press the button to kick, and then you're going in the direction that you have the joystick in, and then you spin it around as you need to.
6012694	6040480	but then you would have these like really epically long levels and it ran on there was a very unique kind of Atari hardware at that time because there's other games that look very similar to it like Hard Drivin' I think is one and the Indiana Jones game was on that same hardware you know there's a bulk of games Atari put out that all kind of ran on that same thing 720 I think it's in some of the Midway classic collections too I do believe you are correct yeah so I don't know why they got oh no because they picked up the Atari arcade assets at some point I think so hmm
6040979	6042740	I should say, skate or die.
6044581	6045022	Very cool.
6045562	6049644	Well, the next story, this kind of came up earlier in the show, but I have it listed, so I'll mention this.
6050025	6054467	Final Fantasy XIV, the beta, was actually delayed a little bit.
6054507	6062933	It was supposed to start originally on August 31st, but they actually had to delay it a day because of critical bugs and all this stuff.
6063513	6091546	but here's the crazy thing a lot of people have been having difficulty getting into the open beta there's been limited signups and all this other stuff going on they stopped issuing beta codes they took down the installer altogether it's all crazy September 22nd is supposed to be the launch of this game three weeks this game is supposed to launch that'll go over well I'm sure so I don't know
6092987	6096149	What made you decide not to get the Final Fantasy XIV beta, Alan?
6097070	6100832	Watching you play it and your less-than-stellar feedback of it when you played it.
6100972	6101612	Yeah, pretty much.
6102033	6103213	Were you interested in it before?
6103874	6108957	Well, yeah, I signed up when you did for the... Oh, I thought you were just doing that for me.
6109397	6115281	Well, I'm into WoW now, so I've got enough interest in MMOs to at least check out the competitions.
6116571	6118973	But you were playing MMOs before, wow, City of Heroes, right?
6119053	6121054	Yeah, City of Heroes You never got Going Rogue, did you?
6122194	6123075	Have you read anything on it?
6124776	6142505	I checked Metacritic and I think Game Rankings the week it came out and it didn't have anything So I don't think that IGN and all the big review sites have treated it as a priority Maybe now there are some reviews up Well, let's take a look, we have a little time Because it was an actual standalone release, right?
6144318	6154423	Yeah, if you buy the Going Rogue Edition, which is like $29.95, if you plug in that license, you have access to the whole game.
6155664	6156685	Yep, no one's reviewed it yet.
6158466	6159106	Yeah, none.
6160686	6160986	Wow.
6162228	6163108	I guess people just don't care.
6163128	6165270	Still going strong, but its community is really underground.
6165751	6167192	No one talks about COH anymore.
6167292	6167793	That's weird.
6169094	6173498	I see a comment from Ziba in our chatroom saying, I still say Guild Wars 2 for the win.
6175080	6179744	Yeah, after looking at that footage, Guild Wars was kind of like, I can kind of take it or leave it.
6179784	6180284	Guild Wars...
6180905	6181526	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6196323	6219661	then Guild Wars 2 that some of that gameplay footage came out it looks awesome like I gotta say I'm I'm really like it's all actiony and it looks really cool see that's where like MMOs are going these days is more actiony and that's cool I'm really excited about DC Universe Online if I mentioned that where's the beta for that I want to play that all right Dark Sakura more news for us
6220359	6221060	I do indeed.

6336472	6338454	People who are going to Tokyo Game Show, get me stuff.
6340819	6345381	I'd like to go like one day, just once, to say I did it.
6345481	6348102	I'd like to go longer than one day, so I can actually spend some time in Japan.
6348122	6349822	I meant like one day I would like to go, sorry.
6350582	6351143	For the whole show.
6352423	6357425	Alright, this is another story about some big surprises, and I think this will make Alan very happy.
6358205	6362947	In an interview with PC Gamer, Gabe Newell from Valve, of course, has said...
6363687	6367589	I can guarantee you people are going to be surprised at stuff we do.
6368309	6370710	And this is after he already... Are you rolling your eyes?
6372370	6376872	This is after they came out and said the whole Steam Cloud support on PS3 and all that good stuff.
6377292	6380513	But he said, quote, this isn't going to stop anytime soon.
6380793	6383755	I'm just laughing because people will be shocked again.
6384415	6387636	We have three big surprises in the next 12 months at least.
6390901	6401610	If you are a Half-Life fan, you really aren't allowed to get mad at Gabe Newell and Valve because if you do, they might keep Half-Life in a closet forever.
6402431	6404493	It's very much an abusive relationship.
6404533	6411018	And of course, all of the blogs that are posting this story have a picture of Gordon Freeman in his HEV suit.
6412139	6414121	I really hope it's something Half-Life.
6415522	6441350	I Half-Life 2 came out six years ago and it's I hey it took 11 years for Starcraft 2 just saying oh yeah and I I only really play first-person shooters like Bioshock or Half-Life that have that narrative and the story like the cliffhanger at the end of Half-Life 2 episode 2 was so epic it's like it's like I'm a five-year-old on Christmas morning I want that game
6442259	6451854	Now, there was recently a trademark for Defense of the Ancients, and that of course makes people speculate that there will be a real-time strategy game update to Defense of the Ancients.
6452114	6453196	So, don't know.
6453527	6458551	Well, yeah, that's that Warcraft 3 mod that Valve is trying to publish as their own thing.
6458831	6459271	Oh, really?
6459872	6462554	And Blizzard was like... Oh, that's right, because they hired all those people, huh?
6462594	6464175	And Blizzard was like, LOL, no.
6464935	6467257	I think that's still in litigation right now.
6467357	6468698	Well, maybe they'll just change the name.
6468758	6469098	Who knows?
6470439	6471580	Be interesting if that happens.
6473201	6474142	Maybe Left 4 Dead 3.
6474842	6476223	I'm sure that would be a big surprise.
6476404	6477544	Oh, you're rolling your eyes over there.
6477584	6477985	I see you.
6478085	6479446	Don't think I don't see you rolling your eyes.
6481187	6481988	Not a Left 4 Dead fan?
6483965	6492433	It's a great game, but I feel that they have other franchises they should focus on more promptly.
6495135	6496936	You don't want to see a new IP come out of Valve?
6497197	6497877	The next Portal?
6498118	6502301	They shouldn't work on a damn thing until the next Half-Life.
6502341	6503142	They don't know.
6503202	6503943	You don't want to see Portal 3?
6505865	6511916	I will go to their office with a ruler and I will slap the little knuckles of their programmer's head and go, what are you working on?
6512336	6513138	That's not Half-Life.
6513238	6513559	Wap.
6514400	6514761	Wap.
6514841	6516344	And then security will drag me out.
6517806	6518628	That is how I feel.
6521743	6523484	How does chat feel about this?
6523544	6525504	Does chat want their half-life?
6526384	6529005	Either 3 proper or episode 3 proper?
6529105	6540968	Monty Boggs in chat says I already forgot how episode 2 ended I should probably go back if they do announce a sequel Floppy Discourse in chat says Left 4 Dead 3 rocks
6543021	6546542	It probably came out already because they have a six-month development cycle on those games.
6547763	6549384	But yet Half-Life takes six years.
6550484	6553585	What do you think they're doing to this game to make it just so... I don't know.
6554106	6555346	I guess I shouldn't ask these questions.
6555426	6561649	I read the Half-Life 2 book that came out about how big Half-Life 2 was going to be.
6561769	6564430	Half-Life 2 for a first-person shooter is a really long game.
6566691	6592042	all of the conceptual stuff where they want we want this set piece we want this event to happen it was going to be like an 80 hour game and they had to cut out all this stuff so same thing could be happening for Half-Life 3 RedRotainment in chat says I wanted Half-Life 2 years ago DarkCircuitry says more Half-Life heart and DarkTetsuya says no there's only one game I'm looking forward to in the immediate future and it's on the Wii
6592864	6594406	I'm guessing that's the La Mulana game.
6594426	6595347	Didn't that already come out?
6595608	6597250	No, I guess it's still in the future.
6597711	6598031	I don't know.
6598812	6607144	Hoseo Sumiuragawa is looking forward a little more to the Final Fantasy VII remake that still has not been announced and probably is never going to be.
6608977	6619826	I'm really disappointed that we haven't heard anything about a DS or even DS 3D, 3DS, Final Fantasy 5 or Final Fantasy 6.
6621447	6623188	You know how they remade the SNES ones.
6623228	6624890	Oh yeah, Final Fantasy 4 was awesome.
6625030	6625931	Yeah, it was amazing.
6626791	6630855	I think 6 might be too big of a game, but they could do 5, it would sell really well here.
6631776	6632056	Yeah.
6633200	6633300	Or 6.
6633560	6637804	I mean, don't take this the wrong way, but fuck 5.
6637944	6640426	Like, 6 is really where it's at.
6640486	6648393	Like, you know, again, to put the hate mail down, I still like Final Fantasy 5, but it's just Final Fantasy 6 is like, it's way up here.
6648854	6651136	Like, Final Fantasy 5 is vanilla ice cream.
6651156	6655059	Like, it's good, and I'm not gonna turn it down, and it's like, you know, it's cool.
6655420	6657521	But Final Fantasy 6... Final Fantasy 6?
6657782	6658322	Final Fantasy 6...
6659503	6662666	is like peanut butter cups and chocolate ice cream.
6662806	6667110	It's like words I shouldn't say on the radio.
6667230	6667430	Yes.
6668832	6669112	All right.
6669873	6670613	We're at what time?
6670653	6671254	Oh, we're at 745.
6671394	6672115	Do we need a break then?
6672600	6673982	Yeah, because the place closes at 9.
6674523	6677046	Okay, let's break after that story.
6677486	6679128	And we'll come back and we'll do a few more.
6679569	6681151	No, you guys are going to do Ask Orange Lounge, right?
6681171	6682132	Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.
6682152	6683354	But they should send them to you.
6683374	6683754	To me.
6684595	6686878	So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge with Dark Sakura.
6686998	6688380	Via private message.
6688500	6690423	And the Skype line will also be open for you guys.
6690743	6691243	if you want to do that.
6691283	6692844	Okay, I'll come over.
6693104	6693644	Okay, sounds good.
6694485	6700287	So I'm going to, we're going to take a quick music break while we order dinner and then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.
6700307	6701768	So send your questions again, not me.
6701848	6704289	They won't get ready if you send them to me, DarkSakura in our chat room.
6704669	6707791	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send in some questions.
6708031	6710872	We're going to take a quick break but we'll be right back with the Orange Lounge Radio.
6711372	6712413	Marathon Show
6733434	6734174	It's a little different.
6734374	6737355	You may have missed last week's show where we told you guys we're going to be doing something special this week.
6737955	6739295	Loki has already come and gone.
6739355	6745717	He was here at 2 o'clock for the quote-unquote normal show that went until about 5.30 and now we're kind of in the bonus portion.
6746057	6750798	But now that we are getting into the really random stuff, we actually have to eat.
6750838	6752318	We kind of have to stop to eat.
6753158	6754238	But we're not going to stop the marathon.
6754378	6757199	I'm actually going to run out and get what's called take-and-bake pizzas.
6757259	6761480	So I'm going to get pizzas and then we'll switch off and Jamie's actually going to bake them while we do some other topics.
6762180	6763101	I'm going to bake them.
6763841	6764521	Well, you're the woman.
6766922	6767623	I'll help.
6768343	6769123	I knew it was coming.
6769143	6770984	I don't want to burn down your house either.
6771024	6772325	That's what it really boils down to.
6772665	6773525	But we'll figure something out.
6773545	6775926	We'll play some Talking Heads while Rob cooks.
6776187	6777447	Burning down the house.
6777547	6782069	So anyway, I'm going to step out to go do that, but Dark Sakura is going to take over.
6782309	6783090	God help you all.
6784010	6786091	And do some Ask Orange Lounge, right?
6786471	6787452	Yes.
6787852	6790213	Of course, it wouldn't be Ask Orange Lounge if we didn't have a theme song, right?
6792961	6793981	We could do a duet, Ranma.
6794241	6794501	Okay.
6794601	6794761	No.
6797022	6799943	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
6800483	6803723	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
6804404	6811125	Don't ask me any questions because I'm leaving this house because I know how this segment can sometimes go.
6812325	6814106	I thought you were going to say sometimes suck.
6817386	6818687	Do I look like Wayne Brady?
6818807	6819968	Do I sing improv songs on command?
6819988	6824051	Make like two live crew and get the fuck out my house, bitch.
6824471	6826553	Sky says do the live feed while getting pizza.
6826633	6827794	I could do the Ustream.
6828214	6830155	No, I'm not going to do that and drive at the same time.
6830175	6830856	You guys are crazy.
6831977	6832357	I'm out.
6832517	6835419	I would be forced to yell at Rob for doing something dumb.
6835579	6836200	Be good, kids.
6836520	6836900	I'll be back.
6837721	6838101	Okay.
6839622	6841163	Okay, chatlings, let's see.
6841983	6845884	Haseo Sumiragawa, what's the story with the orange bat?
6846084	6846745	Oh, shit.
6849285	6857128	The orange bat came from March Madness, which was a DDR tournament that they held at Milpitas Golf Land.
6857949	6864691	And it was me and Rob and Jessica and...
6866903	6871865	At the time, her fiancé, and I think, and somebody else who was with us, I don't remember.
6872605	6880107	But we decided that we were just sick of all the people not really doing actual routines when they were doing their thing.
6880127	6890351	So we actually went and got plastic orange bats and little toy trumpets and stomped them a beat.
6891511	6896353	And Rob and I proceeded to hit each other over the head with bats while the others played the trumpets.
6897853	6898514	and it was epic.
6899174	6905159	And then the bat went around and was signed and I think Rob has his bat and then I have my bat.
6905660	6911585	And my bat, I got signed by everyone in Step Squad and RTF, as many people as I could.
6913086	6917230	The bat is in my garage right now.
6918131	6919612	So that's the story of the orange bat.
6921133	6921173	Um...
6924329	6930752	Dark Circuitry asks, which is the better game in your guys' opinion, Pump It Up Pro or In The Groove?
6932413	6932873	Pump It Up.
6934374	6935855	Because, dude, caution drop.
6937296	6937436	No.
6938757	6939897	I'm not a big fan of In The Groove.
6939997	6940437	It's okay.
6940557	6941158	It's playable.
6941358	6944399	But Pump It Up, they're just different types.
6944700	6947281	I mean, same theory, yes, but different.
6948666	6950408	Type of game, if that makes sense.
6950869	6956035	Pump It Up is one of the more major DDR clones where it's the diagonals.
6956255	6957497	It's the five square one.
6957847	6965752	Yeah, I tried playing that once, and I was so in the mindset of DDR that I made it through like two songs, and it basically broke me.
6966112	6969454	Like the different mechanics of the diagonals, I couldn't do it.
6970174	6970995	I didn't touch it since.
6971195	6974197	And I know people who are really, really good at it who do doubles on them.
6974737	6986364	But I just remembered how the caution drop used to work on that, is that you'd follow the diagonal, your knee would hit the middle, and then your foot would hit the top of the back, and then you'd slap the bottom two on those for...
6986684	6987245	Oh wow.
6988047	6991053	They had stuff where you had to hit all five buttons and it was really difficult.
6991313	6995061	So yeah.
6996624	6997145	Ranma!
6997606	6998006	Hi.
6999369	7005070	During OLRthon, how about firing up the Wii for multiplayer Mario Kart or the 360 for Rock Band 2?
7005711	7022335	Well, that's because Dan and Alex have taken over the front room and are shooting each other stupid in a first person, well, not a first person, but in a shooting game, a shmup against each other that we will not mention the name of in this house because it's not here.
7022355	7023875	Right?
7023895	7024075	Right.
7024932	7026774	What's the target time?
7026874	7027014	1am?
7027034	7027094	2am?
7046340	7052847	Midnight is the baseline, I think Hoof Hearted, I guess you like horses, huh?
7053548	7062719	Oh, it's Spazinator Your thought on this It's a 1TB hard drive for $80
7066445	7067426	Okay, go for it.
7068186	7072650	It's not, it doesn't, transfer at 480 megabytes per second, plug and play.
7073991	7075292	Not bad, it's not great.
7075532	7082397	I mean, not like the super most awesome thing in the universe, but hey, cheap terabyte hard drive, why not?
7083066	7097096	I think last January or February I got a terabyte external FireWire USB thing like that for about $110 just to show how cheap hard drive space is becoming, but I use it as my MP3 slash torrents drive.
7097997	7104422	Yeah, I've actually filled up my $500 gig with MP3s and movies and stuff.
7104662	7104882	Yeah.
7105963	7108805	And a whole bunch of obscure Japanese Sentai TV.
7110658	7111978	I like my Tower Rangers!
7111998	7113159	I think your mic's cutting out.
7113959	7114059	Ah!
7114739	7115379	No cutting out, mic.
7115399	7115860	You're not allowed.
7117640	7121501	So, um, next question, and thank you, Spazinator.
7121701	7123362	That looks like it would be a decent purchase.
7124262	7127403	Um, floppy discourse?
7129623	7129783	Ah!
7129903	7130444	Funny!
7130584	7131904	Floppy discourse.
7132144	7132404	Ha.
7133024	7134525	When is Final Fantasy XIV coming out?
7134645	7135485	I don't know and I don't care.
7137330	7142911	I think the PC date is, I think Rob just said it, the 23rd, 24th, three weeks.
7143531	7146952	We're supposed to have 14 available for PC in three weeks.
7148752	7153253	I've completely lost interest in the Final Fantasy online series.
7153273	7154113	It's gorgeous.
7154554	7154914	Beautiful.
7155334	7157954	But pretty does not necessarily mean good.
7159615	7161555	And I'm happy with my Star Trek.
7161863	7164165	What was the first video game you ever played in your life?
7164185	7168027	Pinball tables don't count, but feel free to say what those are too if you remember.
7188496	7189697	My first video game.
7190497	7190957	Pong.
7191437	7191977	Seriously.
7193238	7194999	I played Pong when I was little.
7196039	7200181	And then later on we went on to Kangaroo and Popeye and Donkey Kong.
7203742	7205983	I got an Atari 2600 when I was 4 or 5.
7206383	7206743	I don't know.
7206803	7207884	So any one of those games.
7208004	7208844	Probably Pac-Man.
7209845	7211365	Oh, the Pac-Man version was awful though.
7211385	7213146	But not as bad as E.T. ?
7217150	7218631	Yep, and I played the hell out of that game.
7218811	7220992	Because when you're seven, you don't really have taste.
7222293	7225595	With that Pac-Man, I don't know if it was a setting or something.
7226836	7231479	After a while, it was a weird thing where the power pellet moved to somewhere else other than the middle of the board.
7232259	7234320	I had no idea how it happened.
7235781	7236842	Programming glitch?
7237342	7239483	The first thing I played, I remember, was when I got the...
7241517	7245161	Atari 2600 for like, I think it was fourth Christmas when I was like four.
7245401	7247063	And then we played Asteroids first.
7247924	7254731	Because I remember the big splashy colored asteroids floating around the screen.
7255292	7255952	That's pretty cool.
7256573	7258115	That's a good game to have as your first.
7258675	7259636	Pong is kind of boring.
7260878	7261158	Pong.
7261819	7262059	Pong.
7262880	7263040	Pong.
7266997	7276147	Okay, well, as far as pinball tables, I played all kinds of pinball when I was a kid, so it's really hard to remember.
7276167	7279190	Yeah, the first one I remember playing was, my dad had one called Genie.
7280371	7281412	No, which one?
7281552	7282293	It was called Genie.
7282574	7284756	Oh, I know, one of the 50s ones or 60s ones?
7284776	7286838	Something like that, I don't really know.
7287078	7288600	Little rotating numbers.
7290790	7291611	Found it by Gottlieb
7309654	7316039	Genie, 1979, 4 player, and it is indeed electronic.
7316379	7316759	Was that it?
7317099	7317640	Yep, that's it.
7318640	7324484	And it played like the place in France where the Naked Ladies dance.
7327767	7330429	There's a hole in the wall where the guys can see their mom.
7330829	7332950	Yeah, that was just a track sound.
7333531	7334892	I'll link that in the chat room.
7334912	7334952	Um...
7338570	7342531	I was hoping I might see it at the California stream, but no, they didn't have it.
7342991	7348913	You might be able to find it, though, when they do that other pinball expo, Pacific Pinball Expo.
7349653	7351854	They might have them there because they usually have older tables there.
7356355	7361037	But I really can't remember what my first pinball was and it was something old.
7361977	7364698	Now, what's your first video game you've played in roller skates?
7366718	7367979	Thanks for watching!
7381047	7381407	DarkSakura.com
7410287	7416471	Well, when I would go visit my dad in Dothan, Alabama, the roller rink there was called Bobaloo.
7417271	7421333	And Bob, who was the owner, he'd since passed away, and his wife was Lou.
7422314	7428878	But Bob was friends with my granddaddy, and they taught amateur skating, like figure skating with roller skates.
7429738	7454850	and so I would always go up there and just go hang out and talk and talk about granddaddy but they had the same Frogger machine there while I was growing up and it was still always in good working condition the joystick was a little sticky but it was the same Frogger machine and I played that same machine for easily 10 years so anyway so how about more questions huh?
7456923	7459745	Oh, and Tiara wants to add Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the roller rink.
7461566	7477414	I remember when to play an arcade game it was either the arcade when they still existed or the pizza parlor arcade games there or I remember when Street Fighter 2 came out everyone went to 7-Eleven to play it when 7-Eleven actually had arcade cabinets.
7477964	7482567	Oh yeah, we did go to the... I don't know if it was 7-Eleven, but it was some sort of convenience store.
7482587	7488171	Or like Circle K. Everyone go play Street Fighter 2 at the Circle K. This is out in South Carolina, so I don't remember what it was called.
7488371	7490172	I remember my high school band trip, though.
7490332	7493014	When we went to New York, we drove up.
7493334	7494655	We actually stopped in Washington, D.C.
7494675	7495796	and then went on up to New York.
7496496	7498538	And that was when Mortal Kombat 2 was in beta testing.
7499778	7527926	with all the glitches and the continuous things so we were just Mortal Kombat and the guys would just play it instead of eat but I would play that too because I loved Mortal Kombat and I was really good with Katana but that was that's probably one of my favorite high school video game memories I think other than me letting out a very loud curse while I was playing Zelda Link to the Past while my mom was in the other room oops
7530427	7533369	Okay, so, ooh, Red Entertainment asked a doozy.
7534430	7540233	Which place is more openly hostile to outsiders and those who don't conform to the, quote, norm?
7540814	7541894	Alabama or Utah?
7542335	7543375	I've never been to Utah.
7543816	7555063	People are fairly nice in Alabama unless you just say they're very, like, people try, they tend to be nice unless they're just super backwards rednecks, I guess.
7555083	7555823	I don't know.
7556884	7557705	I can't tell you about Utah.
7557725	7558185	I've never been.
7560427	7561467	Anyone here been to Utah?
7561747	7563828	I've been through there, but I haven't really dealt with the people that much.
7564348	7566329	I was actually there for a day and a half, too.
7566989	7567169	Yeah.
7569070	7569710	Couldn't really tell.
7569730	7571571	I think everyone's got their bad places.
7571991	7573411	Yeah, it just depends on who you run into.
7574852	7583635	Like, don't go, like, wearing a I voted for Perot shirt in, you know, Alabama or something.
7584375	7586396	Or I miss Bill Clinton.
7587456	7587656	You know?
7590265	7591606	Last comes from DarkTetsuya.
7592266	7594847	Can we resurrect Name That Tune now that we have time, that is?
7595568	7595688	No.
7597669	7600030	Not until Rob gets back anyway, because then Rob can do all that for us.
7601431	7608835	See, we're a little lazy right now, and we're just sort of leaning back and... Ooh, chit-chat.
7608975	7610475	People, send me more questions, damn it!
7612176	7613137	Comment from chat.
7613157	7615358	See if we can figure out what a game is from a description.
7616317	7618099	Did you ever play the Odyssey 2?
7618159	7618239	No
7644333	7645013	We actually have one.
7645054	7646734	We do not have a TV that it will run on.
7646754	7648575	Because it's that old.
7648915	7651417	Does it have Venture as one of the games on it?
7651557	7655659	I don't think it had Venture, but it had this... Oh, that was ColecoVision.
7655819	7657860	It had Casey's Crazy Chase and Casey Munchkin.
7659321	7661282	Crazy Chase was the clone of Pac-Man.
7661882	7664163	And they got sued and had to bury all these copies.
7664183	7666304	So if you have a copy of Casey Munchkin, it's kind of rare.
7666984	7668545	Which I think I've got two copies now.
7668605	7669366	No, I never played it.
7670086	7671168	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
7678157	7679158	I want to say 85 or 86.
7679998	7685001	Okay, so then I was... If it was 85, I was 9 then.
7685942	7687283	Because, yeah, I would have been 9.
7688363	7691525	But, yeah, my next-door neighbor had a ColecoVision.
7692005	7698889	And we would play this racing game and Casey Crazy Chase and a game called CryptoQuip.
7699550	7702492	Where you put in a phrase and scramble them up and you had to guess what it is.
7702732	7704273	And I was really good at those word scrambles.
7705573	7734143	but there was another game where you could play as a warrior or a mage or some other person and then a changeling which you could turn into invisible and go through and it was like this you had to get from one side to the other and get the treasure and then it was this weird bizarre game I'm trying to remember the name of it so this is what kind of what I was asking is there's a lot of good games that I used to play and I just can't remember the names of them anymore it's been so long
7735632	7739034	What was the first RPG that you really invested in and finished?
7739154	7743036	Like you saw the ending and you had 30 hours logged or however long it took.
7743557	7744217	First RPG.
7745138	7745618	Video game.
7747919	7750921	I would almost say Final Fantasy except I really lost interest.
7751721	7757705	So I'm going to go with... I know it was on the Nintendo and I'm trying to remember what it was.
7760046	7761127	It wasn't StarTropics.
7761207	7761487	It was...
7763683	7791938	and I can't really put Zelda in it too because Zelda was more well yeah let's eliminate Zelda from this because that's more adventure maybe it was StarTropics it's been a long time is StarTropics or Faxana do or something like that so mine was Dragon Warrior 1 and then Final Fantasy 1 shortly after that on the NES so
7793430	7795092	Yeah, mine was Phantasy Star.
7795693	7797975	Actually, for the most part, I was actually watching my friend play it.
7798035	7806085	He actually got a, I don't know if he called up Sega or something, they sent him a cheat sheet to walk through the game so that we could figure out how to get through it.
7806285	7806765	That's pretty cool.
7807126	7809448	Yeah, that was a really fun game.
7810686	7830676	And what's kind of funny about that game is that when I play, because it kind of scrolls kind of with six frames between the thing, between when you're in the dungeon phase, that when you play like Shining in the Darkness on Genesis, it only does a three frame thing, so it looks kind of, going between those two is kind of weird.
7832077	7834459	We've got a question from Ake Ripper.
7834479	7836501	What's what the next Sims expansion is going to be about?
7837461	7839223	This is not counting Light Knight.
7839243	7840844	Aren't they doing like a Cars one?
7859622	7860063	For Sims 4?
7860163	7860403	Sims 3.
7861424	7862286	Oh, Sims 3, that's right.
7862666	7863567	I think your mic cut out again.
7863928	7865129	Oh, how about that?
7865249	7865590	There it goes.
7866071	7867973	Yeah, I don't really exactly remember what it is.
7868013	7871057	I thought that they were doing like a vehicle-related one.
7871197	7872139	I can find out, I guess.
7872960	7873200	Here we go.
7876647	7878928	I never really got into The Sims.
7879268	7886689	I remember I tried Sims 1 a year or two after it was out and it had already become a worldwide phenomenon.
7887230	7889430	I fussed with it for a couple hours.
7889610	7892071	I never got it.
7892131	7893091	I never figured it out.
7894911	7897172	The only thing on here is just late night.
7897832	7900052	Nothing really after that.
7900572	7902453	At least it's listed anyway.
7902853	7903933	Hey dude, nightclubs.
7905618	7908621	It would be so cool if you can have gay dancing in The Sims.
7909622	7910182	That would be fun.
7911924	7913726	And I wonder what they're going to call beer.
7914526	7915487	They call wine nectar.
7917349	7918290	It should just be wine.
7918990	7919751	And they should have beer.
7920011	7921813	And they need to have hard booze.
7922253	7925797	You should build a moonshine still in your bathroom.
7926057	7929100	Like in Dukes of Hazzard.
7929851	7935113	Sims 2 has so much fan-made content from the 14 whatever expansion packs that came out.
7935153	7936474	I'm sure you can do that stuff in Sims 2.
7936954	7939415	Oh, Sims 3 has a lot of that stuff too.
7939975	7940135	Yeah.
7940336	7944677	And people making game mods and everything and EA knows.
7945218	7945418	Yeah.
7945898	7948319	There's like, okay, well you get to reinstall all of your stuff again.
7950686	7955770	Wow, okay, Red Entertainment also asks, I'm thinking of building a general media library in my house once I buy one.
7956210	7958732	How large is the room your vault is in?
7959592	7960633	It's a small bedroom.
7960973	7965636	It's like 7x7 or something in there.
7965656	7969259	Something like that, yeah.
7969719	7974302	It's big enough for a bed and a dresser and, you know, bedside table.
7974813	7982537	I'd probably put like a... I think a queen-size bed would fit in there, but... We used to have the futon in there, and it took up most of the room.
7982837	7983097	Yeah.
7983958	7984238	Yeah.
7985258	7988440	So, yeah, not a whole lot of... But there's lots of shelves.
7988520	7990181	Things are up to the ceiling.
7990641	8006328	We put in a really big two shelf unit that our friend gave us that has a lot of space on it and then we have utility shelves in the closet and a number of bookshelves up on the walls too.
8007348	8015892	We've maximized our space saving options and I totally recommend investing in bins with lids that you can see through.
8020120	8021681	Hey, no one's sending us any more questions.
8024802	8025483	Is that a Rob?
8026543	8027184	That's a Rob.
8027564	8029785	Of course, the first thing he says when he comes in is bastard.
8031066	8031946	Which is just like Rob.
8033207	8034408	Welcome back, Rob!
8036188	8037049	I'm coming to cook!
8037409	8038950	Because I don't want Rob to burn my house down.
8041211	8041971	He never cooks.
8042612	8042792	Ever.
8043454	8044395	He made toast once.
8045596	8051721	I went to... When he and Loki had the place, I went and made lobster kebabs for Rob.
8052742	8053242	Good times.
8053582	8053903	They were.
8054723	8054943	Okay.
8055264	8055784	I'm gonna go cook.
8056345	8056665	Okay.
8057385	8058326	Are we playing chair roulette?
8058346	8058907	Where am I sitting?
8058987	8060208	You should go sit in Jeremy's chair.
8060348	8060508	Yeah.
8061738	8063019	Hi, I'm back everybody.
8063339	8063960	I had a good trip.
8064000	8065161	Did I miss any good questions?
8065321	8067102	What were questions that were asked?
8067303	8071426	Let's see, like, what was the first game you played?
8073447	8074588	I just thought they timed me.
8074668	8077951	Goldanthro says it took Rob about 19 minutes and 43 seconds.
8078051	8078472	There it is.
8079012	8079532	You know what's funny?
8079572	8080853	I couldn't find the place either.
8080934	8083395	I had to drive, because I knew it was at...
8084216	8106786	such and such street in I-80 and I was like okay well there's a lot of shops around there so I was kind of like looking around I'm like do I go I know of this and yeah I had to drive around a little bit so I would have gotten back in like 14 minutes if I hadn't you know gotten lost that's all right okay sorry the game yes the questions I missed good stuff any good ones
8109644	8117351	Uh, yeah, first game played, and then I think I asked them what the first real RPG that you played from start to finish was.
8117771	8119252	The first game played?
8119752	8122595	Yeah, like, I think ours was like Pac-Man, Combat Outlaws.
8122875	8125557	Oh, oh, like the first game I remember playing.
8126078	8126278	Um...
8128903	8135467	I have memories of playing Spider-Man on the 2600, but I don't think that was the very first game I ever played.
8135547	8143713	Probably Pac-Man on the 2600, that really awful, like, bong, bong, bong, boo-doo-doo-doo, like the old school noises in it.
8143893	8147555	When you hit a ghost, I can't get my voice to go that high, but the...
8149176	8151057	Yeah, it was pretty bad.
8151157	8152879	Have you read the drama about why that happened?
8153059	8159083	I mean, when you read about the whole drama behind it, it actually makes a lot of sense why that game turned out the way it is.
8159343	8162025	They would not let him produce it on the cartridge he needed.
8162945	8163526	And that's why Ms.
8163546	8164566	Pac-Man was so much better.
8165007	8178035	Everything about the epic video game industry bust of 84 and all of the shovelware they were putting out, Pac-Man was related to that because Pac-Man was a national phenomenon and they finally got the home version.
8178075	8179036	It was the ugliest thing.
8179216	8181057	It was ugly as fuck, it really was.
8181077	8182317	Did that game even have fruit in it?
8182337	8184357	It had the wafer in the middle.
8205183	8205663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8234938	8235518	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8256924	8261126	And he still defends that it was not as terrible of a game as everybody says it is.
8261166	8262026	And I don't think it was.
8262807	8268189	It just had a couple key design problems with it that really prevented it from being... Yeah, it's hard to understand.
8269510	8271050	But it was playable.
8271070	8275032	It's probably hard for some people to figure out what you had to do.
8275272	8277953	It took me a while to figure out what you had to do to finish it.
8278093	8278713	It really does.
8278773	8279974	It's not an easy game to figure out.
8280034	8284756	Yeah, it wasn't intuitive at all, but I remember beating it and getting him onto the ship.
8285077	8287418	And then I think every time you do it, doesn't it get harder and harder?
8288178	8288678	I can't remember.
8288899	8289139	Yeah.
8289519	8290399	Yeah, it probably does.
8290439	8293201	But yeah, when you're seven, it's hard to have really discerning taste.
8293261	8295302	That's usually the way the Atari 2600 games work.
8295342	8297003	It's just the same thing over, but it gets harder.
8298944	8300565	Okay, and then the other one was about RPGs.
8300745	8302907	No, you asked a question about RPGs.
8303067	8313435	That was the question that I added was not including Zelda, because I think everyone our age has played Zelda and that's more adventure, but just RPG, Earthbound, StarTropics, whatever.
8313475	8316617	What was the first one you invested in and finished where you saw the ending?
8316737	8318718	That I actually finished or that I played?
8319459	8320259	That you finished.
8320640	8321280	Adventure on the 2600?
8322677	8325399	I never beat Final Fantasy Does it have liquor in it?
8325419	8327320	I'll try it They can't hear you It's brandy and apple juice
8354371	8355732	That is pretty fucking good.
8356752	8357613	Oh, I thought this was for me.
8359634	8360175	Oh, poor Jamie.
8360475	8361115	Come on, Jamie.
8363417	8367840	The look on her face... I'm sorry, the look on her face was of such defeat.
8367920	8372283	Like, this cross between, oh, you bitch, and, oh, you bitch!
8376994	8378715	I'll try what that is, the apple pie thing.
8378735	8379435	You want to try a sip of this?
8379535	8380036	See if you like it?
8380276	8382157	No, I'll like it, I'm sure.
8382477	8383277	Okay.
8386439	8387360	What question were we on?
8387860	8388200	I'm sorry.
8388240	8389541	Oh, Rama, I'm sorry.
8389601	8391402	It just won my heart in there.
8391502	8395204	Not like actually, but it's the first NES game I played was The Goonies 2.
8396244	8400927	That game was so underrated for its time because it was so hard.
8401147	8403008	It was so complicated, but that game is amazing.
8403568	8421495	I beat that game with the help of the Nintendo tip line where it was like what five bucks a call and what 86 87 and I had to basically cry to my grandmother please let me call you've called that number like four times this month all for the same game and I was like please like
8422415	8430360	You don't have to give me a Christmas present if you let me call the Nest line because that was the shit back then.
8430640	8431421	I'd never call it.
8431461	8434863	My mom was like, no, no, no, go to your room.
8435123	8435363	No.
8436584	8437885	She wouldn't budge at all.
8437965	8443948	I could be like, I have an uncurable disease and the only people that could cure it is Nintendo Live.
8444328	8447130	I have to enter the Konami code to cure cancer and I don't know what it is.
8447410	8449111	She's like, do they charge?
8449311	8449591	Yes.
8449952	8450452	Go to your room.
8452651	8455432	So that would be her response, essentially.
8457092	8460294	Sorry, Alan's trying to... We're getting boozed up right now.
8460334	8460814	It's really awesome.
8460834	8463395	Which isn't smart, because I have to drive home in four hours.
8463675	8465875	I mean, I could sleep here, but... Well, who knows?
8465895	8466536	We might go long.
8466716	8467336	I've got energy.
8467776	8468456	All right, we'll see.
8468496	8468796	We'll see.
8469216	8472718	But I was actually sort of thinking that maybe it could have used another shot of Brandy.
8473178	8473518	I'm sorry.
8473598	8474838	I don't want to get too screwed up.
8475899	8476959	Well, Alan gets more and you don't.
8480240	8480821	Where were we?
8480941	8484365	Goonies 2, Nintendo Tip Line, It Was The Shit, etc.
8485305	8485686	Then what?
8486667	8488669	What was the first game you played in roller skates?
8489149	8491832	The first game I played in... Oh, I never answered the RPG one.
8492693	8498679	The RPG... That's not Zelda.
8498699	8498799	Zelda.
8499813	8500714	Dragon Warrior Dragon Warrior
8517810	8518931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8537068	8538028	Dragon Warrior Final Fantasy 1
8565748	8567510	EarthBound was actually Mother 2 in Japan Mother 1 was on the NES
8588436	8594199	But, um, yeah, Mother 2 was on the Super Nintendo, then Mother 3 didn't come out until, like, just recently, right?
8594960	8596040	So, alright.
8596561	8597761	Do we need to play chair roulette again?
8598402	8598782	I'm sorry.
8599342	8599462	No?
8599642	8600123	Oh, you're baking.
8600163	8600623	You're baking.
8600663	8601403	That's right, DarkSakura.
8601483	8602384	Oh, I'm gonna get baked.
8603564	8604165	Stop.
8604525	8609628	No, um, yeah, I figured I may as well stay up, because it's got five more minutes left on it, and I'll just harass Dan.
8609708	8610108	Good times.
8610828	8611649	What pizza did you make first?
8612313	8612893	The pepperoni.
8613253	8614234	Dang, bless your heart.
8614314	8617135	Because I figured most of y'all are going to eat the pepperoni.
8617355	8619155	I can cook my chicken one next.
8619315	8620896	And then the veggie.
8621116	8624197	I'll have a piece of the chicken one, I guess, if the pepperoni goes real fast.
8625097	8628358	Okay, and then you started to ask, what was the first game I played in roller skates?
8629379	8631459	The local roller rink near us had Spy Hunter.
8631819	8633040	And it was a stand-up cabinet.
8633440	8635500	And it was the kind where you actually had the drive pedal.
8635821	8637701	Yes, I would use the roller skates and the drive pedal.
8638261	8640142	I would say it was probably that or air hockey.
8641107	8642248	Good old Roller King.
8642309	8643730	It's still there out in Roseville.
8643790	8645232	It's right by where I grew up.
8646714	8647915	Gitan says his first was Gauntlet.
8647936	8648837	When's Dan going to be on the show?
8648977	8650258	Is Dan going to come be on OLR?
8652864	8656805	The game that should not be named Alright Is that it for Ask Orange Launch?
8657965	8678711	Someone asked if we could play Name That Tune And then I think Jamie was like Dark Destiny has been begging me for that all week I didn't really set it up in advance I'm sorry And I don't even remember how the rules to that go I mean I could see Yeah, we want to do match game and list list But I have to set those up too So we'll play with that later
8679127	8686949	Well, how about when I change out the pizzas, we can do the rest of the questions that are on our list for discussion topics.
8687289	8687469	Okay.
8687630	8692631	Well, actually, I'll tell you what, since really the rest of it was on there for you and Alan.
8695952	8699113	How about you guys go ahead and do your thing?
8700433	8700853	Oh, yeah.
8700913	8701534	Let's get in there.
8701554	8702954	Well, there were a couple news stories, too.
8703014	8703774	Do we want to cover those?
8703794	8705115	Okay.
8706624	8708625	There was one about Telltale.
8708985	8711506	Why don't we just do those after I'm done with pizza?
8711526	8712007	Okay, that's fine.
8712407	8713427	Not like we don't have all night, Rob.
8714348	8717689	Okay, Alan and I wanted to do our own classic games of the week.
8717709	8720370	And I want to let Bradley do one of these too, but I didn't know he was going to be here tonight.
8720410	8723212	So Alan and I are doing our own classic games of the week.
8723232	8727494	We're taking over this segment because, you know, we wanted to have a longer show tonight.
8727734	8730815	And we're kind of jealous that DarkSakura always gets this segment.
8730835	8731896	I mean, don't you get jealous of her?
8733036	8734257	Alan, don't you want to be just like her?
8739753	8742397	So we have our own little Classic Game of the Week segment.
8746363	8748566	Breakman's asking, when are they going to play Truth or Dare?
8748787	8750028	You're going to have to get me drunk or not.
8750129	8750489	All right.
8752212	8753393	Our own Classic Games of the Week.
8755373	8756414	Alan, you want to start first?
8756654	8758175	What did you pick as your classic game of the week?
8758475	8763078	I would love to take a minute to re-familiarize myself with the Wikipedia article on it.
8763098	8763538	Okay, that's fine.
8763558	8763778	I'll do it.
8763798	8764479	So can you go first?
8764539	8765059	Yes, I can.
8766020	8767881	Because you asked so kindly, I will go first.
8767921	8771864	And my classic game of the week... Okay, the music to this sucks, but deal.
8772284	8776507	Okay, I have picked a game that was on the PC a while ago.
8776547	8781210	And you're going to hear this awesome ad-lib noise in the background because it used the ad-lib card to make noise.
8782070	8784592	It was a game called Lexi Cross.
8784612	8784692	What?
8786393	8788033	Lexi Cross was like, there's like no music.
8788114	8789494	It just has the ambient noise to it.
8789894	8793756	Lexi Cross was like a futuristic game show that was on the PC.
8793776	8795337	Let me actually fast forward as an actual gameplay.
8795357	8801660	You're just going to hear that noise like a million times because that was most of the music in the game.
8802080	8829394	but basically what would happen is it was a two player futuristic game show and on each side of the board you would have all these monitors or tiles that you would have your little robot Vanna White that you moved around the screen and she could reveal the tiles but if you hit a blank square your turn would be over but if you hit a silver square that was part of the crossword puzzle then you could keep going so it was like this entire crossword puzzle was hidden underneath
8831641	8832461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8853806	8856787	And at the end of the day, you could spin the wheel was another option.
8856827	8861589	When you feel you've revealed enough tiles on the board, you could spin the wheel for money and it kind of worked like Wheel of Fortune.
8862269	8868511	And once you revealed all the letters on the board, they would all kind of add up to what the answer was.
8868611	8876694	Like all the words in the crossword had something to do with the, like if I fast forward way ahead in this video here, where they actually start spinning for letters if they ever do.
8879056	8882478	I think this guy probably runs out of time at some point, but he's spinning the wheel here.
8883639	8888823	At some point, so many letters will be revealed that they'll all have something in common.
8888863	8898410	Like maybe they're all places in Hawaii, or they're all quotes from Shakespeare or something, characters.
8898790	8900651	So that's kind of what you have to figure out there.
8900751	8903733	So it's a cool little old school game show.
8904694	8926877	and is um I don't know if you can even download that like on good old games or anything like that like I doubt it's available anywhere like that but um it's still out there on probably abandonware sites and good stuff like that but there was copy protection in the manual it actually came with a little tv guide parody that actually was the copy protection you had to know like what was on page seven you remember old school copy protection on pc games like
8927518	8936149	Yeah, I remember playing Leisure Suit Larry at my friend's house and also King's Quest, having to dig through the manual to find the right word.
8936889	8937851	Oh yeah, you know what it was?
8937891	8941435	The copy protection was like, what is on channel such and such at 7 o'clock?
8941495	8943237	Because that's what was in the TV guide.
8943257	8945320	It was like a programming list.
8946781	8948623	I'm reading the Wikipedia article on this.
8948683	8950045	It came out in 1991.
8950085	8951286	It was by Interplay.
8951927	8956893	Interplay made some other awesome old school PC games in the early 90s and stuff.
8956913	8958134	I think they finally shut down in 2000.
8958535	8959155	What did they make?
8959215	8959556	They made...
8961077	8962078	Did they make MDK?
8963139	8963799	They made that.
8963860	8966281	They made Bard's Tale.
8966722	8967863	They're the guys that made Bard's Tale.
8968503	8969064	Good times.
8969824	8971526	Descent was also them.
8971686	8972807	So they had a lot of good stuff.
8973187	8976710	And they say it's a combination of Wheel of Fortune, Scrabble, and Battleship.
8976750	8979552	And that's a pretty good combination.
8979932	8984216	The words eventually comprise a theme or a quotation which the player must guess to win the game.
8984756	8991694	so that's it, a game show, go figure I picked a game show as my little classic game of the week but Lexi Cross, definitely an underlooked classic
8992301	8993181	All right, Alan, you all ready?
8993562	8993862	I am.
8994242	8994602	All right.
8994902	8995703	Oh, Clay Fighter.
8995763	8997043	Dark Tetsuya reminds us in chat.
8997084	8998204	Interplay did make Clay Fighter.
8998484	8999665	Let's play the music one more time.
9000305	9002486	I like this so much, I want to do the classic game all over again.
9003147	9004647	Alan, what is your classic game of the week?
9005028	9018355	Well, for those of us who grew up playing Sierra online games, whether it be Space Quest, King's Quest, or Police Quest, often came across one of their lesser talked about series, the Quest for Glory.
9019355	9023237	franchise and my pick is Quest for Glory 2 Trial by Fire.
9024858	9026939	Came out in November of 1990.
9028260	9030501	Oh, this guy's talking through his thing here.
9030521	9033263	Sorry, I gotta try to find some gameplay of this.
9034403	9036305	I don't know if there's anything where the guy's not talking.
9037625	9039626	You found the one earlier that had the opening.
9039646	9040487	No, he was talking.
9040507	9043489	We didn't listen to the... Let me see.
9044949	9047852	Okay, let's look at the introduction.
9048092	9049593	See, we didn't hear this earlier, did we?
9049933	9050514	I don't think so.
9050534	9054618	I don't want to hear this jerk talk over the game.
9054638	9071753	So, Quest for Glory 1 had a traditional medieval English theme to it, and at the end of the game, after the closing credits, your friend comes by on a flying carpet, and it's sort of a cliffhanger ending, and he swoops the hero up on his flying carpet, and they fly away.
9072473	9082019	And when they land in Quest for Glory 2, they are in Shapir, which is sort of a Persian, you know, 1001 Arabian Nights styled game.
9083099	9085601	It is out of King's Quest and Space Quest.
9085661	9088482	It's more traditionally an RPG.
9088983	9094406	Those games are mostly about their puzzle solving and the narrative.
9094526	9096647	But Quest for Glory actually had classes.
9097147	9099489	You could be a thief, mage, or warrior.
9100149	9101470	I did play this game.
9101550	9102991	Oh my god, it was good.
9103711	9105252	Oh my god, this game was awesome.
9105272	9107253	It didn't trigger until you said that.
9107293	9107974	I was like, I remember.
9108154	9109235	Yeah, you could be the different classes.
9109675	9119101	And you could import your save file from part one so you could keep the same character name and stats that you had at the end of the first one, which was a big deal at the time.
9120421	9129388	There's a puzzle towards the end of the game where you had to knock over these candles because if the candles got lit, this evil ritual would complete.
9130048	9135352	So if you were a mage, you'd cast a magic missile, or if you were a thief, you would throw your knives.
9135992	9139514	So whatever class you were sort of affected how you solved the puzzles.
9140775	9145659	It's about an evil vizier who wanted to raise a genie, the genie Iblis.
9146699	9147180	Okay.
9149421	9170304	and the game took place over the course of 30 days in game time so if you couldn't figure out how to pop how to solve a puzzle for a certain day and your character was tired you would go to the inn and type sleep and go to sleep you'd wake up and then you you had to go out on a fresh clock it'd be 7 a.m and you'd go out and you'd try to solve the puzzles again
9171906	9188788	and you had to wrap up the game within 30 days of game time and the big deal about this game is that if you were super polite and you did all of the optional side quests at the end once you beat the game you would discover that you would unlock the paladin career path
9190604	9208935	and when you saved your game file and loaded it into quest for glory 3 you would be a paladin and that you could unlock that depending on it didn't matter if you were a thief or really important interruption you'll eat veggie right yes okay they're all getting their pizza while i talk about this game um
9212000	9221242	So yeah, Quest for Glory came along pretty late in the EGA text-based adventure game era of Sierra.
9221782	9228984	Only the first two had EGA graphics and were completely text-driven, as far as entering the commands.
9229484	9233325	Quest for Glory 3, which had a more African...
9234225	9245389	slash Mayan setting to it was had by then adapted to VGA graphics and the mouse cursor where you click on look or touch and then that's how you interacted with the puzzles.
9247139	9252881	So yeah, I played this game all through 8th grade and freshman year of high school.
9253761	9254901	And it is super awesome.
9256081	9264344	And it's one of the few franchises that people often overlook when talking about the glory of Sierra Online's reign.
9264364	9269325	That's true, because most people remember Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, especially the fourth one.
9269785	9271206	But usually this one gets overlooked.
9271286	9272166	That and Space Quest.
9272546	9272686	Yeah.
9273857	9302306	so yeah the fact that you could start with Quest for Glory 1 and use the same save file the same character sheet all through Quest for Glory 5 which I owned but I never played because it was very Quest for Glory 5 came out in I think the mid 90s late 90s when adventure games were dead no one cared no one was doing them anymore so it was very buggy and broken and I never really finished it but this one out of the original classics part 2 is definitely the best
9304274	9306356	What was it about 2 that made you love it the most?
9307397	9309319	Just the music, the atmosphere.
9311441	9315485	It basically took everything that was in 1 and just made it better, like a sequel should.
9316710	9318311	Derek H and Chad asked a good question.
9318351	9319672	What happened to Roberta Williams?
9320373	9322214	Didn't she kind of... I don't know.
9322254	9325216	She wasn't happy with the way the gaming culture was going, right?
9325256	9327377	She wasn't a fan of consoles, if I'm not mistaken.
9328118	9337524	The last thing that she really consulted on, I want to say, was Quest for Glory 8, which had this guy in it that wasn't from the...
9339426	9341027	and Daventry and all that.
9341087	9346832	It was very ugly, clunky 3D adventure game with real-time combat.
9346852	9347533	It was awful.
9348294	9349655	King's Quest Mask of Eternity.
9350215	9352277	That was the last thing that she sort of consulted on.
9352938	9359304	But after that, I think Sierra went bankrupt because adventure gaming was over.
9359544	9359744	Right.
9360985	9363226	Real quick, I'm looking at a Wikipedia article on her.
9363286	9364606	She also made Phantasmagoria.
9364786	9366506	Remember, it was also towards the end of her run.
9367007	9369587	Across seven discs when it came out.
9369687	9370007	Epic.
9370587	9374368	She retired in 1998, and she's kind of stayed away from the public eye.
9374408	9384251	She really doesn't want to give interviews ever to talk about it, but she did talk about it in 2006, and she said that her favorite game that she ever created was Phantasmagoria, not King's Quest.
9384671	9384951	She said,
9402845	9406387	I have to say, before I go out and check on the pizza again, Fantasma Gloria was amazing.
9406807	9407007	The end.
9407027	9407227	It was.
9408008	9408468	It was awesome.
9409108	9410889	So many epic FMVs and stuff.
9412150	9418473	Roberta Williams also went on to say that she said that her games are explicitly targeted towards a more affluent and educated audience.
9419153	9422355	And it actually made people kind of criticize her that she was kind of an elitist.
9422835	9426297	But she did sum up her feelings in 99 with an interview on Gamers Depot.
9426677	9426897	Quote,
9429458	9433899	Back then, the demographics of people who were into computer games was totally different, in my opinion, than they are today.
9434359	9440260	Back then, computers were more expensive, which made them more exclusive to people who were maybe at a certain income level or education level.
9440600	9443620	So the people who played computer games 15 years ago were that type of person.
9443940	9448681	They probably didn't watch television as much, and the instant gratification era hadn't quite grown the way it has lately.
9449101	9452002	I think in the last five or six years, the demographics have really changed.
9452322	9455883	Now, this is my opinion, because computers are less expensive, so more people can afford them.
9456203	9458423	More average people now feel they should own one.
9459264	9473400	Yeah, well, back in 1987, 88, 89, if you had a computer with EGA graphics, a 20 meg hard drive with 512k RAM, that was like four or five grand.
9473781	9475062	Like, you were loaded if you had a...
9477905	9479885	IBM Desktop with Color back then.
9480466	9482686	Oh yeah, you had to be really well off.
9482787	9489869	I want to say our first Packard Bell was like a 386SX16 or something and it was like a $2,000 computer.
9490190	9492090	It was very expensive.
9494031	9503315	By the way, also Roberta Williams said in a 2006 interview that designing computer games is in the past for her now but she does want to write a historical novel someday.
9504536	9505156	So there you go.
9506777	9507438	That's awesome.
9507478	9511661	She was on the cover of Soft Porn Adventure by Online Systems.
9512141	9513302	She's actually on the cover.
9513382	9514683	That is crazy.
9515604	9516124	How funny.
9516985	9528654	I almost chose Leisure Suit Larry 3 for my pick because aside from the whole EGA boobies, it's an incredibly difficult and fun adventure game.
9529594	9530015	Very cool.
9532016	9557471	also her last game she's credited with is King's Quest Mask of Eternity in 98 which I'm assuming is King's Quest 8 which was the last official King's Quest game I wonder what capacity she worked on that game because that was three years after Phantasmagoria in 95 and she didn't do anything in Phantasmagoria 2 so there you go
9559591	9560172	All right.
9560352	9564535	That was kind of a nice little derivative there to talk about that.
9565376	9567117	I think we'll go ahead and kind of take a quick break.
9567177	9573483	It'll give us a chance to eat here and get the other pizza done, and we're going to just play a little bit of music, save this part of the show we have done so far.
9573823	9574844	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
9574864	9576365	When we come back, we'll do more of your questions.
9576385	9584732	We'll do more calls, too, and a couple more stories for you guys as well when we come back with the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon live here at All Games Radio.
9584752	9585373	We'll be right back.
