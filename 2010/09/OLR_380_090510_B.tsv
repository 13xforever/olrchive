0	14000	And welcome back, everybody, to the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon. That's right, we're doing a marathon podcast this week, basically just because we can.
14000	21000	We're gonna podcast as long as we possibly can here on this Saturday, September the 5th of 2010. It won't be anything that impressive, you guys.
21000	26000	We're thinking about going about for 12 hours or so, just, you know, talking about video games and reminiscing about old games and all that good stuff.
26000	34000	So, we just finished the normal show, so if this is the first thing that you're hearing on the podcast feed, you're gonna wanna go back.
34000	41000	The actual show show was put up earlier this week, so just, you know, double check your podcast feed to make sure you kinda have everything.
41000	50000	At the very end of the show, we had some problems with our chat room. Our internet went down right in the middle of everything and we ended up getting booted from our server.
50000	57000	And all this stuff, it was terrible, but we think we've got that all worked out. Thank you to Alan, who is, like, a bigger nerd than me.
57000	63000	I never thought I would be able to say that, but yes, he's a bigger nerd than me. He knew how to set this whole thing up.
63000	65000	What are we doing right now, Alan? How are we getting an IRC?
65000	73000	My roommate has a domain name that he uses for a little Linux box that we run out of our spare bedroom. It's a little mail server.
73000	80000	So we're SSH'd into that box and we're running IRC from there. So we're just shelled into my computer at home.
80000	81000	Alright.
81000	83000	I got a little OCD with the mic cord.
83000	94000	Okay, well, we'll fix it later, but we're gonna go into the vault. Jamie and Arkadia42 are on their way into the vault and gonna take over for a little bit here, talking about old stuff.
94000	96000	Dark Soccer, everybody.
96000	98000	Dark Soccer, tell us a little bit about the vault.
98000	105000	It's a room in the back of my house. A room in the back of my house that has all of our game crap in it.
105000	111000	And I totally meant to grab my iPhone so that I could actually, you know, take pictures and put them up on the website.
111000	117000	I could try doing the Ustream thing real fast. I don't know how well this is gonna work, but I'll try it.
117000	119000	Alright.
119000	124000	You know, actually, Alan, you could read chat for a little bit. Oh, you wanna be cameraman? I'll do cameraman for a minute here.
124000	128000	This is all live radio, folks.
128000	132000	So, everyone has to come in here and pick one thing.
132000	135000	Alright, we'll come in here in a minute.
135000	138000	I'm gonna see if I can do this broadcasting. Okay, let's see.
138000	142000	Well, since we're already in here, Bradley, why don't you pick something?
142000	145000	Dark Soccer, I'm gonna bring in the camera, okay?
145000	147000	I'm gonna bring in the camera, is that okay?
147000	149000	Okay, just so long as it's not me on it.
149000	151000	I'll try my best. Just dodge my phone.
151000	152000	Then I better put my phone back in here.
152000	153000	Alright.
153000	155000	I had Bradley pick something.
155000	156000	Yeah, yeah.
156000	161000	Alright, we're live, and I don't even know where we're at.
161000	167000	We're at Ustream slash Orange Lounge, I think, is where we're broadcasting at.
167000	170000	So, I'm gonna go make my way into the vault.
170000	173000	I'll give my mic to Alan while I walk over there.
173000	180000	Right now, we have Bradley going through the Saturn section of my house, which is pretty much our domestic Saturn stuff.
180000	182000	Yeah, at the moment.
182000	186000	The dusty little things here.
186000	188000	It always takes me a while to decide on these things.
188000	192000	Let's look here.
192000	194000	Which voices?
194000	199000	Well, is it like candy?
199000	200000	What was that?
200000	201000	Is it like candy?
201000	203000	Yeah.
203000	206000	Let's see.
206000	208000	I saw one up here.
208000	215000	Blazing Dragons. That was a fun game, because it's like a puzzle game where you control the dragon and...
215000	216000	Let's go ahead and pull it out.
216000	217000	Oh, where'd it go?
217000	218000	Put it on the camera.
218000	220000	Oh, there's some top, I think.
220000	221000	Yeah.
221000	222000	Right there.
222000	225000	Oh, they're Capcom shot glasses.
225000	227000	Right there.
227000	228000	I think that's what it was.
228000	230000	Go ahead and put it up on the...
230000	238000	Basically, it's a comedy puzzle game where you go around and try to figure out how to solve certain puzzles,
238000	242000	where you've got to satisfy what a person wants you to do for them.
242000	251000	Something like you needed to wash all the dishes, so you have to put together a Rube Goldberg device to rig up the dishes.
251000	264000	Basically, it puts something on top of a fire to blow a turntable around or a fan around so that they can put it in a system.
264000	271000	And there's catapulting one place where you have to shoot a cat at a wall.
271000	277000	And if you miss, it makes noises at you and runs back, or actually does it for each time.
277000	279000	Okay.
279000	280000	It's a pretty fun game.
280000	282000	Well, Rob, your turn to pick something.
282000	284000	What am I...
284000	286000	Am I on here? I don't even know.
286000	288000	Is it recording? Is it going through, Alan?
288000	289000	Okay.
289000	292000	We don't usually do remote broadcasting from the other rooms, so this is a little different for us.
292000	295000	So I don't know what to pick.
295000	297000	Okay, you want to hold this while I dig through something?
297000	298000	Yeah.
298000	299000	Okay. Hold on.
299000	300000	Because I'm going to...
300000	302000	This is awesome radio, I'm sure.
302000	308000	I see all these NES games up here, and I'm assuming that one of these is going to be something awesome.
308000	309000	It could be.
309000	311000	Or it could suck. I don't know.
311000	314000	God, you have all these Japanese games stacked on top of everything, too.
314000	315000	I know.
315000	317000	What are those? Let's see.
317000	318000	I don't know.
318000	320000	Oh, Final Fantasy III and Mappy.
320000	322000	And Mappy, and apparently you paid 20 bucks for each of them.
322000	324000	No, I didn't. I paid five.
324000	325000	They were marked down.
325000	326000	They were marked down.
326000	328000	Let's see, what's in this one here?
328000	331000	Gradius, Track and Field, Contra.
331000	333000	Did I just push the button?
333000	334000	What happened? Did it?
334000	335000	It locked.
335000	336000	It locked?
336000	338000	Warning, you stopped. Okay, go live.
338000	339000	Yeah.
339000	341000	Okay, now we're connecting now.
341000	344000	It wants to keep following us. Maybe we have to plug it in, I don't know.
344000	345000	Okay, we're connected now.
345000	346000	Alright.
346000	347000	Sorry.
347000	348000	I don't know, I wasn't prepared to dig through here.
348000	349000	Rob broke the...
349000	350000	Hold on, let me look at Super Nintendo.
350000	351000	Right behind you.
351000	352000	Help.
352000	353000	Yeah.
353000	354000	Got your mic.
354000	355000	Hi.
355000	356000	Hello.
356000	363000	So I think someone looked up the correct channel name and put it in IRC.
363000	369000	I think it's orange-lounge-radio for the Ustream.
369000	370000	Oh.
370000	371000	So that's all taken care of.
371000	373000	Alright, good. Good deal.
373000	375000	Let's see.
375000	378000	You got all these Mega Man games in this one. That's kind of fun.
378000	379000	Yeah.
379000	384000	What's in this?
384000	386000	Rob started to make the face.
386000	394000	I did, because I... I'll talk about this game.
394000	398000	Yep, it's Super Metroid.
398000	401000	Can you give me a mic?
401000	408000	So Super Metroid is the game I picked up there, and Super Metroid is probably like one of the greatest video games they ever frickin' made, ever.
408000	411000	It's probably my favorite video game of all time, happens to be in this little bin right here.
411000	414000	If I can hold this up for the Ustream viewers too.
414000	419000	Super Metroid is Amazeballs because it's kind of a quick game.
419000	425000	It's not something that takes you days and days to beat, so you can play through it in a good sitting in a day.
425000	428000	If you wanted to play through this tonight, we probably could.
428000	430000	We could play this all in one sitting.
430000	435000	I probably could play through the entire game if I could remember the whole thing. I don't know.
435000	441000	I like Super Metroid because it has a lot of that replayability and re-exploreability value to it.
441000	445000	There's different ways you can play the game. You can play to be a completionist.
445000	447000	You can play to be a speed runner.
447000	452000	You can play to show off different tricks or try to find things that are hidden.
452000	459000	It really set the stage for things that followed it that are also awesome, like Castlevania, which a lot of people started calling Metroidvania.
459000	464000	The music was phenomenal, and the upgrades to the weapons.
464000	467000	Everything about it was just super.
467000	471000	That's why Super Metroid is definitely a fond favorite of mine.
471000	477000	That's something I've talked about many times on the show before. It's one of my personal favorite games.
477000	480000	We need to find a box for it, I think.
480000	485000	Okay, so, Alan, it's your turn. Pick something that you see.
491000	494000	So, Alan's currently digging through the vault.
494000	499000	I don't know if I like this whole Ustream thing, though, because it's too much for us to monitor, because trying to run the radio feed is bad enough.
499000	502000	So, we might kill this video feed.
505000	507000	I've just been running my thumb over it to keep it active.
507000	511000	Alright, I'm going to kill the video feed for now until we have something a little more worthy of showing on video.
511000	512000	Sorry, guys.
512000	513000	Sorry, guys.
514000	516000	But it's also killing the battery on my phone.
518000	523000	Oh, my phone is hot. It feels like it's going to explode in my hand, so that's probably not a good thing.
523000	524000	Is it gushy?
524000	529000	So, tell the listeners a little bit about where you collect all of these different games from.
529000	532000	Every freaking where. I mean, seriously.
534000	546000	We used to just go hit up thrift stores and the flea market and a couple of used game places in town and just pick up things when we could find them.
546000	553000	Like, when we got our Nomad, it was right when they stopped making the Nomads and we managed to get ours on clearance for $25.
553000	559000	So, I mean, some of these will just, you know, luck into a pretty awesome sale.
561000	569000	And, like, we got a big box of Master System games for, I want to say, like, $100 for 200 games or something like that.
570000	571000	You found something?
571000	572000	Yes.
572000	576000	Marvel Super Heroes for the Sega Saturn.
577000	585000	One of the advantages of owning a Saturn in the US compared to the original PlayStation was that the original PlayStation was crap for 2D games.
585000	594000	The Saturn could do arcade perfect frame rates for all of the over-the-top Capcom X-Men licensed games like Children of the Atom.
594000	597000	I got my Saturn for this game.
597000	601000	And then I got it chipped and I imported Darkstalkers 3 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
601000	605000	So, this is definitely a lot of hours logged on this one.
607000	615000	I really like that game. Although, I wonder what it would have been like if they had released the 1 meg and 4 meg cart in the US.
615000	617000	If that would have just made it completely a lot more awesome.
617000	622000	Because that's why X-Men vs. Street Fighter is only really playable on the Saturn.
622000	624000	Because of the cartridge.
624000	630000	Okay, my turn. Shoot, this is all my shit.
632000	633000	Crap.
634000	636000	I know hue cards are in there somewhere.
638000	640000	Have you done some rearranging in the vault lately?
640000	641000	Dan did some.
641000	643000	You guys took the couch out of here.
643000	645000	The futon is gone. We got rid of it.
645000	648000	Oh wow, I was thinking we'd all have a futon to sit on in here, but I guess that's not the case.
648000	650000	So we will have to go out to the front room at some point.
650000	652000	Hopefully our mics will get us out there too.
652000	653000	That'll be good.
653000	654000	I'm sure.
654000	655000	God, I can't think.
655000	659000	I'm noticing Atari 2600 stuff here.
659000	662000	Yeah, this is sort of our, we have nowhere else to put this stuff, shelf.
665000	666000	Let's see, man.
666000	668000	So we can friend your butt.
668000	670000	Okay, I think this is...
673000	677000	Nope, that's not it. It's a soundtrack for Berserk.
677000	679000	For the video game.
679000	683000	Now, just so you guys know, we did have to kill the video stream because it was just a little janky,
683000	687000	but if you do want to see more of the vault on our YouTube channel,
687000	690000	which is youtube.com slash orange lounge radio, if I'm not mistaken,
690000	692000	we do actually have a clip.
692000	694000	It's like a little tour of Dark Sakura's vault.
694000	696000	It's been redone since then.
696000	698000	It has changed a little bit.
698000	701000	We do need to get some new video other than what we just showed on Ustream,
701000	704000	but you can get an idea just how massive this collection is.
704000	708000	Like, you know, I'm looking one way and I see two TVs up on the wall,
708000	712000	PlayStation 2 rack of games, I see Neo Geo games,
712000	714000	I see all these arcade sticks,
714000	717000	I look another way, I see different steering wheels,
717000	718000	I pick something.
718000	719000	A CDX.
719000	720000	The CDX.
720000	722000	You're not picking a game, you're picking a CDX.
722000	724000	Well, if I didn't say you had to pick a game, I should have picked something.
724000	726000	Alright, fine. What do you want to say about the CDX?
726000	731000	It's awesome, and it's like having a really tiny Sega CD,
731000	733000	although it does not work very well with the 32X,
733000	737000	you have to kind of modify the hookup and get these brackets to hold it up,
737000	739000	but the CDX is freaking awesome.
739000	743000	And I love it. I love it quite dearly.
743000	746000	How'd you guys end up with two Gamegears over here?
746000	748000	I'm looking at two Gamegears. One of them's blue and one of them's black.
748000	751000	I think the blue one is Julie's.
751000	752000	Nice.
752000	753000	You just stole it.
753000	756000	No, she, okay, look at the Dreamcast dance pads.
756000	758000	One of those is hers. She bought it.
758000	761000	It never has been in her house.
761000	764000	It has always been at my house, so it's pretty much mine anyway now.
764000	767000	And same with the Gamegears. I think she just left it with us, so it's ours.
767000	770000	It's kind of like when the neighbor throws a ball in your yard,
770000	772000	and it's like, you know, see this? It's mine now, you little brats.
772000	776000	We got this for our Nintendo points, the Game & Watch collection.
776000	781000	I owned a Gamegear briefly in the eighth grade, and I've seen one now.
781000	783000	I do not remember it being that gigantic.
783000	786000	It's huge. It's like bigger than a VHS tape. I don't...
786000	790000	And they're heavy. Well, we've got the battery attached to this,
790000	792000	the little backup battery thing.
792000	794000	Yeah, I don't...
794000	800000	Well, you want to see big, though. We've got links somewhere around here.
800000	804000	And all of our stuff is so dusty.
804000	809000	Do we have another mic on the ground?
809000	812000	Yeah, we've got stuff everywhere.
812000	815000	I like this stress script, Game Boy Advance.
815000	821000	That was a promo thing from E3, I think, a while back.
821000	826000	I have a GBA that I mailed it in and got it modded for the backlight.
826000	828000	So it's mine. We still have mine.
828000	832000	And then the week after I got it back, they announced the clamshell.
832000	834000	But I actually like the bigger model.
834000	835000	The SP?
835000	837000	Yeah, the SP. I actually like the bigger model better for my hands.
837000	843000	I actually had a pink Game Boy Advance, just to be completely opposite of what everyone would think of me.
843000	845000	Because I normally hate pink.
845000	849000	And I actually really dug my pink one and had pink everything.
849000	855000	I don't know if you noticed, but a reoccurring theme in my Saturn collection is Working Designs and Capcom.
855000	861000	I still have my copy of Rayearth that Working Designs did for the Saturn.
861000	865000	It's one of the last games that came out for the Saturn in the US.
865000	870000	Let me see what I've got up here. Rayearth right here.
870000	875000	I loved that they took out all the spoken dialogue from the Japanese version.
875000	879000	Because it used up so much memory and made the game so laggy.
879000	880000	Oh wow.
880000	883000	Because it did comments over every little thing they picked up.
883000	885000	Instead they just left it all text.
885000	887000	We believe you can read.
887000	890000	We have Iron Storm.
890000	894000	Probably that so they can have the voice actors doing all the work for that one.
894000	897000	Snake of Ages.
897000	900000	What's that one right there?
900000	903000	Can I actually jump in here, you guys, real quick?
903000	906000	I'm actually in the other room, or I'm watching the chat room.
906000	910000	I actually want to jump in here and say real quick, because it is 6 o'clock Pacific at this time.
910000	914000	We might have some folks tuning in right now expecting to hear Orange On's radio, kind of like as it normally is.
914000	917000	You forgot that this week is the marathon episode.
917000	919000	We've actually been on the air since 2 p.m.
919000	924000	If you're just joining us now expecting to hear the normal episode of OLR, it already happened.
924000	926000	We finished that up at about 5.30.
926000	929000	Loki is gone. He went back to go take care of the baby.
929000	933000	But I'm here. Rob Roberts and Dark Soccer is here as well.
933000	936000	As well as Salacious Pop and Arcadium 42.
936000	939000	Right now we're looking in the vault at some old games.
939000	943000	Just kind of thumbing through and seeing what nostalgic dust is.
943000	944000	Literal dust.
944000	947000	Awakened from some of it.
947000	951000	Yeah, we were going through my list of working designs games.
951000	954000	So yeah, back here, that's Albert Odyssey, I think.
954000	957000	Yeah, actually I decided to sell my copy of that off.
957000	959000	I've only played a little bit of it, but neither has run out of money.
959000	965000	We've also got Shining Wisdom, Dragon Force, Sonic R.
965000	967000	I love Sonic R, don't get me wrong.
967000	968000	No.
968000	970000	Can you feel the sunshine?
970000	973000	Does it brighten up your day?
973000	976000	But yeah, we've got tons of crap.
976000	979000	Dude, now I want to break out the Saturn for reals and play stuff,
979000	983000	but Dan has the Saturn hooked up in here, and the monitor is, like, little.
983000	986000	I want to play the Saturn in the front room.
986000	989000	So the stuff that we actually have hooked up right now in here,
989000	992000	because we've got things set up on Switch boxes.
992000	1001000	We've got an Xbox 360, Dreamcast, Saturn, GameCube Neo Geo CD,
1001000	1008000	Super Nintendo, Turbo Duo, and the Sega CD 32X.
1008000	1014000	And what else do we have sort of put away?
1014000	1016000	Where did Dan put the actual Neo Geo?
1016000	1018000	Because we actually have a Neo Geo.
1018000	1022000	And then, I think it's funny, Dan got the Atari Flashback 2
1022000	1026000	that looks like the old 2600, but it's got 40 games stored in it.
1026000	1030000	And, you know, I could break out my What the Fuck game.
1030000	1037000	Cardcaptor Sakura that comes with a plate, and a clock, and silverware.
1037000	1040000	I think you showed all that in the unboxing video that you did on YouTube.
1040000	1042000	It's in the unboxing video.
1042000	1048000	Because, man, I'm not trying to sound braggy or anything.
1048000	1051000	I mean, we just have the stuff.
1051000	1055000	And, oh, the R4 with the JOGCON set.
1055000	1062000	I got that for painting a Sonic on the door of a local used game store.
1062000	1066000	I remember video game swappers back in the day.
1066000	1069000	But that's how I got my R4 and JOGCON.
1069000	1072000	And we've got the boxes of controllers.
1072000	1076000	And they're just different systems and stuff.
1076000	1080000	Here's the box of PlayStation controllers, which I think the NEGCON is in.
1080000	1082000	I'm going to fish that out.
1082000	1084000	Who wants my mic?
1084000	1087000	Actually, I wanted to ask you some questions about the vault here.
1087000	1089000	I'm sorry, we keep switching positions and everything,
1089000	1091000	but I'm making my way back into the vault,
1091000	1093000	because it's much cooler in here than it is in the actual studio
1093000	1095000	where all the computers are going.
1095000	1098000	Uh-oh, Dark Sakura's trying to get this big plastic bin.
1098000	1101000	It looks like they store a lot of controllers and power cords
1101000	1103000	and all that stuff in these big plastic bins
1103000	1108000	to help keep things kind of separated.
1108000	1110000	What are you looking for, Dark Sakura?
1110000	1113000	My NEGCON.
1113000	1115000	Wow. You guys have some really obscure stuff.
1115000	1117000	Let's talk about the vault for a little bit,
1117000	1119000	because we have a lot of people in chat,
1119000	1121000	and I'm sure a lot of listeners of the show that are like,
1121000	1123000	wow, you guys are kind of like a special kind of crazy,
1123000	1129000	having your own room in the house dedicated to a video game museum sort of thing.
1129000	1132000	And how did this all start between you and Dan?
1132000	1136000	Oh, gee. Well, when Dan and I first got together,
1136000	1139000	he had already had a bunch of stuff.
1139000	1144000	I mean, he had a Neo Geo and a few games,
1144000	1147000	and he had a NES, and he had a SNES,
1147000	1149000	and I moved out here with my SNES and a few PlayStation games,
1149000	1151000	and he had a PlayStation and a Saturn.
1151000	1155000	And we just sort of would get nostalgic about stuff
1155000	1161000	and go looking for things, and we ended up getting the Turbo Duo.
1161000	1164000	No, I think he already had the Turbo Duo when I moved out here.
1164000	1165000	Let me take it a step back.
1165000	1167000	I know you've told this story sometimes on the show before.
1167000	1169000	We have time to kill tonight.
1169000	1170000	How did you and Dan kind of end up meeting?
1170000	1172000	How did you and Dan kind of come together?
1172000	1173000	Yeah, have a seat.
1173000	1176000	We're sitting on the floor of the vault just chatting.
1176000	1177000	No chatters right now.
1177000	1179000	Sorry, chat room, but you're in the other room where we can't see you,
1179000	1182000	but we'll run back and look in a minute.
1182000	1187000	Back in the day when I lived in Mobile, Alabama,
1187000	1194000	Dan was a friend of mine online, and my roommates introduced me to him
1194000	1199000	because he had the name Dark Ryoga, and I had the name Dark Uchon.
1199000	1203000	So we hung out for a while, and he was my buddy,
1203000	1208000	and would be up really late my time, relatively late his time.
1208000	1212000	And just exchanged bad fan fiction, and he was my buddy.
1212000	1213000	He was fun.
1213000	1220000	And then I had a really, really bad breakup with the guy I was with at the time,
1220000	1224000	and Dan called me to cheer me up.
1224000	1226000	He had some five-minute calling cards,
1226000	1228000	and he ended up using three of them, I think, that night.
1228000	1231000	And then we ended up talking the next night, and I called him,
1231000	1237000	and he called me, and we'd talk on the pay phone from Denny's and stuff.
1237000	1240000	And then finally one day, at the time I was working at,
1240000	1244000	I think had since moved from working at the arcade.
1244000	1249000	I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyber Station at the malls.
1249000	1255000	But I went from working there to working at this herb shop kiosk in the mall,
1255000	1257000	and it was really great.
1257000	1260000	I could sit and read my books all day if I wanted to.
1260000	1263000	So Dan, we had been talking the night before
1263000	1265000	because we were trying to open up another store
1265000	1267000	so that we could make enough revenue to keep two stores open
1267000	1270000	instead of having to close the one we had.
1270000	1275000	And I said, hey, if we don't get the show, the store,
1275000	1277000	then can I come out and stay with you?
1277000	1278000	I was just joking.
1278000	1280000	He was like, I guess so.
1280000	1282000	And so the next day I go to work, and they said,
1282000	1284000	yeah, they gave our spot to somebody else.
1284000	1286000	We have to close the store in a month.
1286000	1288000	I was like, so when my boss left, I called Dan,
1288000	1290000	and I was like, so were you serious?
1290000	1291000	He's like, I guess so.
1291000	1292000	We're going to go see Batman.
1292000	1294000	We'll talk about this later.
1294000	1297000	If that dates when the conversation happened.
1297000	1300000	Wait, the original Batman was like 91.
1300000	1301000	It can't be that Batman.
1301000	1302000	No.
1302000	1303000	It was some.
1303000	1304000	One of the sequels.
1304000	1305000	One, yeah.
1305000	1307000	No, 89 was the original Batman.
1307000	1308000	Yeah.
1308000	1309000	But anyway.
1309000	1310000	Yeah.
1310000	1314000	But at any rate, I was actually on the plane
1314000	1316000	probably within two weeks.
1316000	1318000	And I've been happy here ever since I came out here
1318000	1322000	with 100 bucks in my pocket and a Super Nintendo.
1322000	1324000	Did you literally pack a Super Nintendo in your luggage?
1324000	1326000	Did you leave everything at home when you came?
1326000	1327000	I packed a trunk full of stuff.
1327000	1330000	I packed a big old bag full of stuff, taped it up,
1330000	1331000	and brought it on the plane with me,
1331000	1333000	and amongst it was my Super Nintendo.
1333000	1334000	Wow.
1334000	1335000	And all my games.
1335000	1336000	Wow.
1336000	1337000	And my one PlayStation game.
1337000	1338000	No, my two PlayStation games.
1338000	1339000	And I didn't even own a PlayStation.
1339000	1343000	It was Dragon Ball GT Final Bout and Final Fantasy VII.
1343000	1344000	Whatever happened to all your stuff at home?
1344000	1345000	Did you ever go back to get it,
1345000	1347000	or did you just have it shipped here in little bits and pieces,
1347000	1349000	or did you just kind of let it rot, or what?
1349000	1352000	Well, I would go back and visit and bring stuff back with me,
1352000	1354000	and Grandmom would send me some of my stuff,
1354000	1357000	and little things like that, but I lost a lot.
1357000	1360000	I kept bringing back boxes of comics for some reason.
1360000	1364000	But a lot of my books were water damaged
1364000	1367000	from how poorly they were being stored.
1367000	1372000	And I lost a lot of cool stuff.
1372000	1374000	I did manage to bring back a lot of cool stuff with me.
1374000	1377000	So most of my things, I think, are back with me.
1377000	1380000	I lost stuff from my dorm room I really wanted,
1380000	1383000	because they were things that people picked up for me
1383000	1386000	from Civil War reenactments and rent fares and things.
1386000	1388000	Okay, so now we're kind of getting caught up
1388000	1391000	to where we were at before, is that you came out here
1391000	1393000	and you had only the Super Nintendo
1393000	1394000	and a couple PlayStation games,
1394000	1397000	but you obviously had this nerd love thing
1397000	1399000	going on with Dan, right?
1399000	1400000	Yeah.
1400000	1401000	Oh, that's from the EVA.
1401000	1403000	So you guys just kind of started mutually
1403000	1404000	this collection together.
1404000	1406000	Do you remember what the first thing was
1406000	1408000	you guys bought together? Do you remember?
1408000	1411000	I don't really remember all that well, to be honest.
1411000	1413000	That's okay.
1413000	1416000	I know one of the early things,
1416000	1419000	because I think he already had a Genesis,
1419000	1421000	we picked up a Sega CD together.
1421000	1423000	That was one of the first things that we got,
1423000	1426000	because we really wanted to play Sega CD games.
1426000	1429000	And we found it cheap, and then we got 32X after that.
1429000	1434000	And it just kept growing, really.
1434000	1436000	We would just find things.
1436000	1438000	Oh, shoot, I was listing out all my stuff
1438000	1440000	and I forgot to put my WinterSwan color on it.
1440000	1442000	No, no, I was recently putting all my stuff up
1442000	1444000	for Infamous.net, because they wanted the list
1444000	1447000	of my gaming systems, and I forgot the WinterSwan.
1447000	1450000	Well, now you're just going to lose all that cred.
1450000	1454000	But the way things went, it was just,
1454000	1456000	we would run in and, oh, that's cool,
1456000	1458000	oh, that's cool, oh, that's cool.
1458000	1460000	And then, you know, we'd sometimes say,
1460000	1462000	I really want to play this game.
1462000	1466000	So we picked up a Neo Geo, not Neo Geo, a Turbo Duo,
1466000	1469000	not Turbo Duo, PC Engine Core Graphics.
1469000	1473000	Sorry, I had to think of system and country and everything,
1473000	1478000	which is the Japanese version of the Turbo Graphics.
1478000	1481000	And because you cannot play the HuCard games.
1481000	1483000	They are not compatible.
1483000	1489000	There's one converter that's supposed to work okay.
1489000	1491000	We could never get to work, and if you find
1491000	1494000	it's super expensive, we may as well just buy the system.
1494000	1496000	So we got a Core Graphics so we could play
1496000	1499000	our Japanese HuCards.
1499000	1502000	A lot of it is just like, it's here,
1502000	1505000	we have the money right now, why don't we get it?
1505000	1507000	And then Dan was working at GameStop and then GameCrazy,
1507000	1509000	so when he knew stuff that come out,
1509000	1511000	it'd be like, let's get it.
1511000	1513000	And when the PS3 came out, he had just quit GameStop,
1513000	1518000	but he had put in his pre-register, pre-order as manager,
1518000	1520000	so he was first in line, so he went and got it.
1520000	1523000	And then Discover gave us $100 credit back
1523000	1525000	because he had spent so much.
1525000	1528000	So we basically got our $700 system for $600.
1528000	1532000	And we still have it, our original PS3 works just fine.
1532000	1533000	So it's just one of those things where your collection
1533000	1535000	just kept growing and growing and growing,
1535000	1536000	and then it suddenly needed its own room
1536000	1537000	because you're just both gamers.
1537000	1538000	I wonder what that is behind you.
1538000	1540000	Will you grab me that black and blue case please?
1540000	1541000	The black and blue case, hold on.
1541000	1543000	I want to see what it is.
1543000	1545000	Because keep in mind, we also have a lot of stuff
1545000	1547000	just packed up in, oh it's empty isn't it?
1547000	1549000	It feels empty.
1549000	1555000	Because we've just got stuff packed up in bags and things,
1555000	1557000	old systems, like I think one of the things behind you
1557000	1558000	is an Xbox.
1558000	1560000	In that black and red case there,
1560000	1564000	that's where we keep the Neo Geo.
1564000	1567000	Like the AVS cartridge Neo Geo.
1567000	1569000	And someone just sold us a Neo CD for like $100
1569000	1571000	with a bunch of games.
1571000	1573000	So like I said, when we get these things,
1573000	1575000	they sort of fall into our lap.
1575000	1578000	Where do you think all this stuff's going to end up someday?
1578000	1580000	Like do you see yourselves hanging on to this forever?
1580000	1583000	Or what's going to happen, passing it on to children?
1583000	1586000	Dan's talked about selling it a couple of times,
1586000	1589000	but then we get talking about it and neither of us
1589000	1591000	can really see ourselves parting with it.
1591000	1594000	Because it's not like somebody's going to call hoarders on you guys
1594000	1596000	because you really neatly have stacked everything
1596000	1599000	and it seems like there's organized chaos in here.
1599000	1602000	Yeah, and we pull stuff out all the time to play with it.
1602000	1604000	And I wouldn't say you guys are like obsessive compulsive either.
1604000	1605000	It's not really like that.
1605000	1607000	It's just this collection that has gone insane.
1607000	1612000	It really just sort of happened up there with all the Bimani stuff
1612000	1614000	when we really got into music games.
1614000	1617000	We just kept getting controllers and systems and,
1617000	1620000	oh, American Beatmania 2DX, let's get it.
1620000	1625000	And the guitar freaks, we both had to have a guitar.
1625000	1628000	And then I found the drum kit really cheap from,
1628000	1631000	not Toys N' Joys, but it was another importer.
1631000	1633000	Speaking randomly of American 2DX,
1633000	1635000	I wanted to throw this out here.
1635000	1638000	Because it wasn't news that made the earlier show.
1638000	1640000	But Naoki runs a Facebook.
1640000	1642000	And it really is him. I asked him when I saw him at E3.
1642000	1643000	It's his Facebook.
1643000	1646000	And he was actually asking questions about music games on there this week.
1646000	1650000	And he actually said, what type of music game is your favorite?
1650000	1653000	And would you want to see another karaoke type of game?
1653000	1655000	And overwhelmingly, it seemed the response was like,
1655000	1658000	no, we don't need any more karaoke games.
1658000	1660000	And everybody was like, 2DX, 2DX, 2DX.
1660000	1663000	Bring 2DX on the PS3. Please release on the PS3.
1663000	1666000	Because if they did release it, it would be region free.
1666000	1668000	Where even if they released it in Japan,
1668000	1670000	you know you're going to have tons of people over here buying it.
1670000	1671000	Oh, hell yes.
1671000	1673000	That might be part of the reason it's getting held up.
1673000	1675000	Maybe they're having problems with music licenses or what have you.
1675000	1678000	Although I don't think they license a lot of music for BeatMania anymore.
1678000	1679000	I don't know.
1679000	1683000	Well, I actually answered on the thing too.
1683000	1684000	Did you?
1684000	1686000	And I was reading other people's responses. They were funny.
1686000	1688000	I did, but I got in late.
1688000	1691000	But yeah, the Pink Biscuits up there.
1691000	1694000	I think we bought a friend of ours, Para Para.
1694000	1695000	Para Para.
1695000	1699000	Up at the very top to the left of Samba de Amigo in keyboard mania.
1699000	1703000	Which soon the Kinect is going to be taking the place of some of that type of stuff.
1703000	1704000	It's funny how technology has come.
1704000	1707000	I really want a Para Para game. I want a Tech Para game.
1707000	1713000	Well, our other thing too is that Dan and I like playing games with good controllers.
1713000	1716000	We love controllers.
1716000	1719000	What other good, like, back in the day topics can we talk about?
1719000	1722000	We can talk about trying to remember the first time we all met.
1722000	1726000	I don't know if I totally remember the very first time I met our Sakura.
1726000	1727000	I remember.
1727000	1729000	It was at Milpitas Golf Land playing Para Para.
1729000	1730000	And you showed up with Jessica.
1730000	1731000	I did, yeah.
1731000	1736000	And she was, for those that followed the DDR scene for a long time, she was a Guana girl.
1736000	1739000	One of the administrators, I think, for a while on the DDR Freak forums.
1739000	1742000	She's still listed as one. I don't think she does anything.
1742000	1745000	I think she's like a legacy administrator or something.
1745000	1747000	I'm still there as a moderator.
1747000	1753000	A lot of people don't know that is that she and I actually played our very first game of DDR together.
1753000	1756000	And it's kind of funny because we both ended up taking on...
1756000	1757000	We actually went...
1757000	1759000	And I think this is kind of common knowledge now.
1759000	1760000	We had a spat for many years.
1760000	1764000	We had a personal disagreement that just got way out of control and it was really ugly.
1764000	1769000	And we've worked our stuff out since then and we have a pleasant friendship and everything.
1769000	1772000	And I think it's great that she's back on Understadation Live.
1772000	1775000	And I know her and Travis have always had a really funny conversation style.
1775000	1777000	So that's really cool and I'm happy for her.
1777000	1780000	A lot of people don't know that a lot of us...
1780000	1782000	We kind of started that whole thing together.
1782000	1785000	And she went on to do this thing with DDR Freak.
1785000	1788000	And then I went on to start OLR with you guys.
1788000	1792000	It's just kind of really funny how we kind of branched off and did these big projects.
1792000	1797000	The DDR Freak thing sort of came up right just after, I think, we started Orange Lounge.
1797000	1800000	DDR Freak Radio was a project and it was always...
1800000	1804000	I haven't talked about this a lot, but we're in the marathon part of the show.
1804000	1806000	We don't expect a lot of people to listen to.
1806000	1809000	When DDR Freak Radio kind of first came out, we were...
1809000	1812000	At least I think you kind of knew about both projects.
1812000	1815000	We couldn't say anything because you kind of had to walk this delicate line, right?
1815000	1817000	Which is what I was doing for a long time.
1817000	1821000	And when I found out, I was a little bit irritated, truthfully.
1821000	1824000	Because we had that kind of personal conflict going on.
1824000	1829000	But then I was like, dammit, this whole idea that I've really tried to take off the ground and so forth.
1829000	1833000	Like, you know, was just kind of like shot in the foot.
1833000	1836000	But then you kind of take lemons and you make lemonade, right?
1836000	1842000	So it's like, okay, well, if they're going to do this thing, how can we do this and make it our own?
1842000	1845000	And make it, you know, its own type of thing.
1845000	1849000	And then it turns out we started OLR with the Dance Mania stuff incorporated.
1849000	1852000	The talk radio was built into that as well.
1852000	1855000	So, you know, that kind of ended up being our shtick.
1855000	1859000	I think DDR Freak is still on at Live Through the Five, but I don't think it's maintained.
1859000	1862000	Our real strength has always been our versatility.
1862000	1866000	And it was, I think a lot of people don't realize that...
1866000	1867000	This is Alex.
1867000	1868000	Hi, Alex. How are you doing?
1868000	1870000	Come in real quick. Say hi to everybody.
1870000	1872000	We're actually broadcasting our marathon. I don't know if Dan told you.
1872000	1874000	We're on a marathon episode of our show right now.
1874000	1875000	Marathon.
1875000	1877000	It was a marathon. How are you doing, Alex?
1877000	1878000	Doing pretty good.
1878000	1881000	You have an online, you got to get real close to the, these mics aren't very sensitive.
1881000	1883000	Do you have an online name you use that you want people to know?
1883000	1887000	I suppose you can tell people that I use the name Five Gears.
1887000	1891000	Five Gears. Alright, Five Gears. What kind of games do you play?
1891000	1896000	Mostly single player today. I can't afford to play Xbox Live.
1896000	1899000	Did you hear they're jacking up the price? Ten bucks. We just talked about that earlier.
1899000	1906000	Yeah, that's, well, I don't usually play online anymore.
1906000	1909000	But when I did, it was a lot of Halo.
1909000	1914000	And I'm probably going to have to, depending on how Reach goes, because I'm going to try that out.
1914000	1920000	Not that it's here or anything. Just, you know, you're going to try it someday. Legally.
1920000	1921000	Oh, of course.
1921000	1922000	Absolutely.
1922000	1927000	But when I try it out, I'll see if it's worth actually playing.
1927000	1932000	And playing online with friends is really the only reason why I ever did it in the first place.
1932000	1934000	I have all kinds of online games on PC.
1934000	1935000	Like Mr. World of Warcraft here.
1935000	1938000	Hey, hey, hey. Not going to lie.
1938000	1940000	World of Warcraft. I used to play that.
1940000	1944000	I still do. I was talking about the Cataclysm beta earlier in the show.
1944000	1945000	Yeah.
1945000	1946000	Playing that a little bit.
1946000	1947000	When are you going to get the needle in your arm, man?
1947000	1950000	My hands are going to be epic. When my friends stop playing.
1950000	1952000	Because honestly, it's the only reason I play. No, really. I mean, it is.
1952000	1956000	And they're my real-life friends. And people I know, like in the Bay Area and Allen, we all play together.
1956000	1958000	And it's like, you know, it's just kind of like the thing now.
1958000	1962000	You know, I could give a shit about the game itself a lot of days.
1962000	1966000	But it's just kind of the way we all hang out. It's kind of nerdy, but awesome.
1966000	1972000	No, no, no. That's fine. You know, it used to be, for me, it was all about just playing first-person shooters online with people.
1972000	1975000	Well, that's what my college buddies and I used to do.
1975000	1980000	We used to play Quake online. We used to play Halo 2 for a long time. All that good stuff.
1980000	1985000	Yeah, no. For me right now, if I do play online at all, it's Bad Company 2 on PC.
1985000	1988000	All right. By the way, you should be voicing movie trailers. Just so you know.
1988000	1990000	What's your Solid Snake impression?
1990000	1993000	Another Solid Snake impression? In a wor-
1993000	1999000	I'm getting my impressions mixed up.
1999000	2002000	Allen's looking at Chad, and they think he's Solid Snake?
2002000	2003000	Yeah.
2003000	2004000	Awesome.
2004000	2007000	If you want to look at Chad and read us some comments, there's a mic in there that's hot.
2007000	2011000	You just have to be loud enough for us to hear you back here.
2011000	2012000	He's going in there.
2012000	2013000	He's going in there to see if Chad-
2013000	2014000	We're fucking bad.
2014000	2016000	I feel bad because we've been neglecting the chat room, but we're having-
2016000	2017000	We heart you, Chad.
2017000	2018000	We're having memories.
2018000	2019000	We heart you, Chad.
2019000	2020000	Here.
2020000	2022000	Memories.
2022000	2027000	Where was I? I was talking about the conflict that Iguana Girl and I had, but we're cool now.
2027000	2028000	And then I was talking about-
2028000	2029000	Yeah, now she hates me.
2029000	2030000	Well-
2030000	2031000	I can't give a shit.
2031000	2034000	I'm trying to stay with the positive.
2034000	2035000	I am.
2035000	2039000	But I was talking about the conflict, but then, okay, the day, there was a New Year's.
2039000	2042000	Was it 05 or 06, I think?
2042000	2043000	Something like that?
2043000	2046000	That she came- Well, it was after we buried the hatchet.
2046000	2049000	It had to be just based on other events.
2049000	2050000	I know that happened around that time.
2050000	2052000	I think it was 05.
2052000	2058000	We actually ended up doing a broadcast from Orange Lounge Studios for DDR Free Radio.
2058000	2064000	That was like the Nintendo and Sega logos appearing at the same time when you first boot up some of it, like F-Zero and some of those.
2064000	2065000	That was a huge event.
2065000	2066000	Yeah.
2066000	2067000	But a lot of people didn't know the difference.
2067000	2068000	We did the New Year's.
2068000	2069000	But it was huge.
2069000	2071000	The New Year's Bimani countdown.
2071000	2072000	Yeah.
2072000	2073000	But it was good.
2073000	2075000	I'm glad that all worked out.
2075000	2078000	Anyhow, wow, didn't mean to get off on those topics.
2078000	2080000	We were back on talking about how we first met.
2080000	2082000	Let's grab a box of games.
2082000	2089000	Well, I got to Dan and me meeting and me moving out here and us, our children multiplying.
2089000	2094000	I'm sorry, our games multiplying.
2094000	2102000	But I really didn't, though, get my own group of friends until I started going to Gothland and playing in the arcades there.
2102000	2104000	Because I was playing DDR at home already.
2104000	2108000	And BeatMania, I had BM98 if you remember the old emulator.
2108000	2111000	And I was playing some of the games and I was like, oh yeah, these are fun.
2111000	2112000	I get to bring over stuff.
2112000	2113000	Oh yeah, this is fun.
2113000	2114000	Which were my friends through Dan.
2114000	2116000	So I'd kind of hear about it.
2116000	2119000	And then I went to the arcade and it was Danielle.
2119000	2121000	You remember her?
2121000	2126000	I put my token up on the machine and she's like, one of us.
2126000	2127000	Nice.
2127000	2132000	So and then everything kind of exploded and our group just got huge.
2132000	2138000	And I had a birthday party at Gothland on the floor in front of the fourth mix.
2138000	2142000	I remember the day the fourth mix hit Gothland, I actually called in sick.
2142000	2144000	Well, I was already, I was like legitimately sick.
2144000	2146000	I called in because I was sick to work.
2146000	2149000	And then I found out that RVGL got fourth mix that day.
2149000	2151000	And I was like, I'm going, I don't even care that I'm sick.
2151000	2153000	I'm going, I'm going to go be one of the first people to play that machine.
2153000	2156000	And I was sick as a dog that I played it.
2156000	2158000	And I probably gave you all cooties.
2158000	2162000	Although I do remember that I was the first person of us to play a Max.
2162000	2163000	How did that work?
2163000	2164000	I was in San Diego.
2164000	2165000	Oh.
2165000	2171000	And the arcade there was like one of the few in SoCal that had it.
2171000	2172000	Very cool.
2172000	2173000	So.
2173000	2177000	Yeah, those, those Gothland nights used to be something else.
2177000	2178000	There they are.
2178000	2179000	Oh, what'd you find?
2179000	2182000	Dark soccer's reaching for, what is this, Saturn games?
2182000	2183000	Dreamcast games.
2183000	2184000	Wrong.
2184000	2185000	Turbo graphics.
2185000	2187000	Oh, snap.
2187000	2188000	R-Type.
2188000	2190000	Space Harrier.
2190000	2192000	Oh yeah, I do have Space Harrier.
2192000	2194000	Welcome to fantasy zone.
2194000	2195000	Get ready.
2195000	2196000	40 bucks.
2196000	2197000	According to the price tag.
2197000	2198000	When it was new.
2198000	2199000	Pac-Land.
2199000	2202000	Ys one and two.
2202000	2204000	Here's my Japanese games.
2204000	2207000	Twinbee.
2207000	2211000	Some weird bizarre shooter called Eldis.
2211000	2213000	Uh.
2213000	2215000	Garud and Tetsu 2.
2215000	2216000	Which is Fatal Fury.
2216000	2218000	Yeah, it's just Fatal Fury, right?
2218000	2219000	Puyo Puyo.
2219000	2220000	Puyo Puyo.
2220000	2224000	Uh, uh, Strider, which we actually cannot play this game.
2224000	2225000	Why's that?
2225000	2226000	Well, it's sealed.
2226000	2227000	That might be one reason why you can't play it.
2227000	2228000	Oh, it's not sealed.
2228000	2229000	It's just.
2229000	2230000	Oh, it looks like it.
2230000	2231000	And sticky paper.
2231000	2232000	Oh.
2232000	2235000	Um, because we do not have, um, a system that we can use an arcade card in.
2235000	2241000	The, um, the one system that I really want, and listeners, if you want to band together
2241000	2247000	and do this for me, I'll be your best friend forever, um, I'm really trying to get a duo
2247000	2253000	RX, because it has the arcade card built into it, um, they're, they're about 150 bucks.
2253000	2256000	I mean, you can get them pretty affordable still.
2256000	2265000	But, um, I can't use an arcade card on my American Turbo Duo because the pin, the pins
2265000	2266000	are wrong.
2266000	2269000	Remember I needed the, the, uh, converter.
2269000	2271000	And the converters are highly unreliable.
2271000	2276000	So, it's one game that we have, and Dan, Dan loves Strider more than anything.
2276000	2281000	The first website that he and I made together was his Strider Zone.
2281000	2283000	You guys made websites together?
2283000	2284000	That's so adorable.
2284000	2285000	Back on AOL.
2285000	2287000	Alan, why are we making websites together?
2287000	2288000	It's so precious.
2288000	2292000	It's called Neo, and I want to know if anyone remembers this.
2292000	2293000	He's just shaking his head at me, like shut up.
2293000	2294000	I want to know if anyone remembers this.
2294000	2296000	It was called Neo Strider Strider Zone.
2296000	2299000	And I touched up all of his graphics.
2299000	2304000	When I was a junior in high school, I had a Sailor Venus fan page on GeoCities.
2304000	2305000	You fag.
2305000	2306000	Yes.
2306000	2310000	Hey, my first cosplay was Sailor Venus.
2310000	2312000	She's the best one.
2312000	2313000	That's awesome.
2313000	2315000	And then there's this.
2315000	2316000	Ooh.
2316000	2317000	Ah.
2317000	2318000	Miranda of Blood.
2318000	2320000	It's the holy grail of the, uh, Castlevania.
2320000	2321000	Would you like to touch it?
2321000	2322000	Yes.
2322000	2323000	I'm surprised you don't have this, like, you know.
2323000	2324000	Shoot, we play it.
2324000	2327000	Framed with, like, laser beams that, like, just cut you, like, the Resident Evil movie
2327000	2328000	when you try to touch it.
2328000	2331000	Or, like, Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment trying to go through the laser beams.
2331000	2334000	I used to be able to, to know, this is all I, the only thing I can read on this is die
2334000	2335000	something custom.
2335000	2338000	It's a tank game.
2338000	2342000	So the, the port that just came out on the Wii, does it look like this or is it different?
2342000	2344000	I haven't tried it on the Wii yet.
2344000	2346000	We haven't got it.
2346000	2349000	I haven't bought it either.
2349000	2350000	Yeah.
2350000	2355000	I, I just, that's, all I know of those is die.
2355000	2356000	So anyway.
2356000	2357000	Die!
2357000	2358000	No.
2358000	2359000	Yeah.
2359000	2363000	I see, I see anime girlies on that one.
2363000	2364000	Yeah.
2364000	2365000	That one right there.
2365000	2366000	Yeah.
2366000	2368000	This is, um, Valis III.
2368000	2371000	And then, yeah, the rest of these are PlayStation.
2371000	2372000	Tempest X.
2372000	2376000	I think we got a, these, these characters look familiar.
2376000	2378000	I think we got an American version of this at some point.
2378000	2379000	Yeah, we did.
2379000	2383000	Those are the NAMCO games on PlayStation that were all the Namco stuff.
2383000	2385000	And then wasn't there, like, a trademark symbol game that's really rare?
2385000	2386000	In Japan.
2386000	2387000	Yeah.
2387000	2388000	It's a restricted symbol.
2388000	2389000	And someone is supposed to be getting it for me.
2389000	2390000	Nice.
2390000	2391000	What's in it that's so special?
2391000	2392000	I don't remember.
2392000	2393000	But this one was really hard.
2393000	2394000	Just won it.
2394000	2395000	This one was, I wanted all of them.
2395000	2396000	This one was really hard to find, too.
2396000	2399000	The O, um, that has Legend of the Valkyrie in it.
2399000	2401000	Which is such a cute little fun game.
2401000	2404000	And here's, we, we've got, yeah, we've got all five of them.
2404000	2405000	Of the US ones.
2405000	2406000	So, the first one.
2406000	2407000	Wow.
2407000	2408000	It took us forever to get all of them.
2408000	2409000	Trust me.
2409000	2414000	So the first one is Pac-Man, Galaga, Pole Position, Bosconian, Rally X, New Rally X,
2414000	2415000	and Toy Pop.
2415000	2417000	Then Xevious, um, Grappler, Super Pac-Man.
2417000	2419000	This was the one that was the hardest to find, was the A.
2419000	2421000	Because I wanted Super Pac-Man.
2421000	2423000	Mappy, Grobda, and Dragon Buster.
2423000	2425000	You know we covered that story?
2425000	2427000	That said, oh, Grobda, we're gonna get it remixed.
2427000	2430000	I'm like, dude, it already came out in the US, so.
2430000	2433000	Uh, and you could play this on the PS3.
2433000	2434000	Because they were playing PS1 games, right?
2434000	2436000	We had to get M as the greatest hits.
2436000	2437000	Uh-huh.
2437000	2438000	Which sucks.
2438000	2439000	Because of Ms. Pac-Man, I'm sure.
2439000	2440000	And Dig Dug.
2440000	2446000	Galaxian, Ms. Pac-Man, Pole Position 2, Dig Dug, Phazon, and, uh, the Tower of Druaga.
2446000	2449000	But you could play that on a PS3 right now if you wanted to, right?
2449000	2450000	Well, this was back in the day on PlayStation.
2450000	2451000	Sure, sure.
2451000	2456000	Then C was Assault, Pac-Land, Ordain, The Return of Ishtar, the Genji and Heike Clans.
2456000	2457000	Wow.
2457000	2464000	And then Motocross, Baraduke, Dragon Spirit, Pac-Mania, and Legend of Valkyrie.
2464000	2466000	Wow.
2466000	2475000	I just remember Assault from the arcade, the tank game, where you get to certain paths and you fly up in the air and you can fire your missiles a long way.
2475000	2477000	That was a fun game.
2477000	2485000	So let me ask one more, like, reminiscy type of question about games, and then maybe we'll take another quick break and move back into the studio and do more stories.
2485000	2487000	Because we actually have a lot of stories still to talk about.
2487000	2492000	Um, clearly we're all, like, game nerds of a certain caliber.
2492000	2493000	No.
2493000	2494000	We wouldn't do this show, right?
2494000	2498000	What do you think, and this is really a question for everybody, so Alan, I hope you're listening too.
2498000	2499000	I know you can hear us in the studio.
2499000	2502000	Um, we get a yep from the other room.
2502000	2507000	What, um, why is it, what do you think made you such a gaming fan?
2507000	2515000	Like, why do you think you play video games and you love the games and the gaming culture, like, so much?
2515000	2517000	I practically grew up with it.
2517000	2522000	I mean, seriously, I remember playing the Atari 2600 when I was a little kid.
2522000	2525000	Um, I remember the Odyssey.
2525000	2532000	You know, I, it's just always been there, and it's always been a fun and kind of integral part of my life.
2532000	2534000	I hope that doesn't sound too sad.
2534000	2536000	But it's just always been there.
2536000	2538000	And...
2538000	2540000	I don't think it's sad because my story is somewhat similar.
2540000	2545000	I didn't like to go outside that much because I had asthma and allergies and everything, and that, and I hated everybody.
2545000	2548000	So, no I didn't.
2548000	2553000	But it was, it was my form of escape, and you know, my mom would play Nintendo with me.
2553000	2555000	She'd play the Nintendo.
2555000	2562000	And then when she was asking me for Christmas one time what to get my brothers, Genesis or Super Nintendo, I told her Super Nintendo, and then I played it the whole time.
2562000	2567000	So, but I mean, it's always been kind of, it's been sort of a bonding thing in my family a little bit.
2567000	2578000	And, and then when I was living in Alabama and playing games, I could play some things over the dial-up connection with friends in California.
2578000	2586000	And, you know, it just was my way of kind of getting out of how crappy Alabama was to live in.
2586000	2589000	I mean, at the time. I don't think Alabama's crappy, don't get me wrong.
2589000	2592000	I love my home state, but I never want to live there again.
2592000	2600000	I just did not like being stuck with everyone expecting me to be one way when I was clearly something other than what they wanted me to be.
2600000	2608000	So I would just play games all the time and kind of forget about it, and then it instead expanded my life.
2608000	2611000	I met my husband because I loved anime and video games.
2611000	2615000	I moved out here, we have a happy life. I have a whole bunch of Transformers.
2615000	2623000	So, I mean, it was, it's really, I think it's opened some doors in my otherwise lack of a social life.
2623000	2628000	And now I think I'm a lot more social than I used to be, and I would say video games have a big part of it.
2628000	2635000	I wouldn't say that, I don't know if it was like a social thing, because I would like to think I was still like kind of social when I was a kid.
2635000	2641000	You know, I have friends and all that stuff, but I think like growing up especially, I was, you know, my brother and sister were so much older than I was.
2641000	2647000	My brother is 14 years older, my sister is 16 years older than I am, and my parents then are quite a bit older.
2647000	2649000	My mom was 37 when she had me.
2649000	2657000	So by the time I was around, not only did I have kind of the only child syndrome thing going on, but my parents had kind of done it all with my brother and sister.
2657000	2661000	You know, they didn't want to do the camping thing or the, you know, a lot of the trips.
2661000	2664000	And not to say they didn't try to do that, because they did.
2664000	2666000	But let's face it, they were just getting older.
2666000	2669000	So I a lot of times just kind of had to entertain myself.
2669000	2679000	And I remember the day we got a Commodore 64 for Christmas, and I actually would play, the family got one for Christmas, and I would actually play that thing.
2679000	2688000	We hooked it up, and I remember like writing one of the programs in the book and running it, and it was like so awesome to know that like something I had done had made this like program.
2688000	2693000	And so I think the Commodore 64 kind of enabled me to gaming, even though we had an Atari 2600 that I played and all that other stuff.
2693000	2702000	But I just found myself like I was really able to entertain myself by like writing these little programs or typing them in for magazines and therefore feeling accomplished.
2702000	2708000	And, you know, trying to get these accomplishments in games and so forth, and the games were sort of something I was able to get into.
2708000	2714000	And I felt like it was something I was kind of good at, and that I was able to kind of like follow the scene. Sorry, I'm just stretching.
2714000	2716000	I was able to like follow the scene pretty good.
2716000	2723000	And whereas like a lot of kids were really good at football or baseball or sports and things that I wasn't so good at, I was good at games.
2723000	2727000	And I could kick their butt in any like video game, and that was always like kind of cool.
2727000	2729000	And I think that's kind of what like enabled me into video games.
2729000	2731000	And of course I was a big band nerd in high school.
2731000	2732000	Me too.
2732000	2739000	So that I think was part of the reason why I got into the music games when they came out, and especially like Busta.
2739000	2742000	Now here in America it was Busta Groove, right?
2742000	2743000	No, Busta Move.
2743000	2744000	It was Busta Move in America.
2744000	2747000	No, in Japan it was Busta Move, in the U.S. it was Busta Groove.
2747000	2751000	Right. So it was Busta Groove that actually got me into games, in the music games.
2751000	2755000	And I know Jamie hates that because that's not what they were called, really.
2755000	2760000	But I didn't know any better, being somebody who didn't really follow the import gaming.
2760000	2762000	It was funny to laugh about it.
2762000	2767000	So we're trying to get the mics untangled as we move back to the studio.
2767000	2769000	We're playing mic roulette here.
2769000	2770000	Yep.
2770000	2771000	But that's how I-
2771000	2772000	Shutting the door on the vault.
2772000	2774000	There you go. That's how I kind of got into music games.
2774000	2777000	And then DDR was like awesome. It was like the best thing I'd ever seen at that point.
2777000	2781000	The ditter was great.
2781000	2785000	All right. So we're retaking seats here.
2785000	2786000	You want to take this, Alan?
2786000	2789000	My butt was going to sleep on that floor.
2789000	2792000	Yes. But I hope you guys enjoyed our little stories from the vault.
2792000	2796000	If you guys want to ask us some questions and chat, chat.orangelandtrady.com.
2796000	2798000	Any types of like follow up or what have you.
2798000	2801000	I'm finally able to look at chat here again.
2801000	2804000	And let's see. We should be, by the way, the G line should be up.
2804000	2805000	I'm trying.
2805000	2807000	So you should be able to get back in. So let me know if you have success.
2807000	2809000	Let's see.
2809000	2814000	Blaze in our chat room says, my mom used to whip my butt in Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo.
2814000	2817000	See, my parents were never like really into games at all.
2817000	2823000	Like, I don't know. My dad, I think would try, but he just, I don't think he was really into it.
2823000	2825000	Like you'd rather just take me mini golfing or something.
2825000	2827000	And then I'd want to play games the whole time we were there.
2827000	2829000	I wouldn't want to really golf.
2829000	2831000	Let's see.
2831000	2834000	Toygak says Bust A Move is a game in the US.
2834000	2837000	Yeah, that was the whole problem. It was Bust A Move was Puzzle Bobble.
2837000	2840000	Yep. Which I think Puzzle Bobble is much cuter.
2840000	2844000	Yeah, it is. So, all right.
2844000	2847000	So I think we're going to take, let's take like a quick, quick break.
2847000	2852000	And when we come back, we'll do some more news stories that we have listed and some of the other chat topics we have.
2852000	2853000	Okay.
2853000	2855000	Does that sound good? And we got to think about what we're going to do for food too.
2855000	2857000	I think we're going to do a take and bake.
2857000	2859000	Right. What time do those places close?
2859000	2860000	Like nine?
2860000	2861000	Yeah.
2861000	2862000	No, tonight?
2862000	2863000	Papa Murphy's? They're like seven, right?
2863000	2865000	Well, then we should go, oh.
2865000	2866000	Yeah, right?
2866000	2867000	Yeah.
2867000	2870000	Well, there used to be one near me before they closed and they were always eight or nine o'clock.
2870000	2871000	Okay.
2871000	2872000	Yeah.
2872000	2873000	We'll call one and find out during this break.
2873000	2874000	Okay.
2874000	2875000	So we're going to take a quick break while I figure out the food situation.
2875000	2876000	Then we're going to come back.
2876000	2881000	We're either going to do stories or if I have to run and get food, I don't know what you guys are going to talk about.
2881000	2882000	You'll think of something.
2882000	2883000	We'll talk about you.
2883000	2884000	Classic game I could do.
2884000	2885000	Or does that come later?
2885000	2886000	That's come later during the stories.
2886000	2887000	Okay.
2887000	2888000	We'll worry about that.
2888000	2889000	But you can talk about PC games or something.
2889000	2890000	I don't know.
2890000	2891000	Or just field questions from chat the whole time.
2891000	2892000	I don't know.
2892000	2893000	We'll figure something out.
2893000	2895000	We should do an ask, let's ask Orange Lounge when we come back.
2895000	2896000	All right.
2896000	2897000	Well, we'll see.
2897000	2898000	We're going to talk about dinner and all that stuff.
2898000	2903000	So we will be right back with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon right after a quick break.
2903000	2906000	We are live at All Games Radio.
2906000	2913000	We'll be right back.
2913000	2915000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
2915000	2920000	We are taping our marathon live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
2920000	2928000	It is Saturday, I want to say October, September 5th of 2010 at 642 p.m.
2928000	2932000	And it is, we've been on the air since what, about 2 o'clock?
2932000	2933000	Something like that.
2933000	2934000	But just a little bit after 2.
2934000	2939000	So we're on our, about four and a half hours in of our show tonight.
2939000	2940000	We had our main show earlier.
2940000	2944000	If you're tuning in expecting to hear Loki and the usual bits and all that,
2944000	2947000	that started at 2 and finished at like 5.30.
2947000	2949000	So we're kind of in the extra stuff now.
2949000	2952000	We're broadcasting all night long because we can.
2952000	2953000	It looks like a lot of you guys are joining us.
2953000	2956000	I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com,
2956000	2959000	which, yay, we're back in after all this time.
2959000	2960000	Thank you guys.
2960000	2962000	And Rama keeps having to remind me it's Sunday.
2962000	2963000	Did I say it's Saturday?
2963000	2964000	Yeah, my bad.
2964000	2965000	I just, I don't know why.
2965000	2967000	I just really want it to be Saturday.
2967000	2968000	Because you have tomorrow off work.
2968000	2969000	I know, because I have tomorrow off work.
2969000	2970000	That's part of it too.
2970000	2974000	So it doesn't like feel like Sunday because usually I'm having to get in that mode of,
2974000	2977000	I got to go back to work tomorrow.
2977000	2979000	So that's actually what I say too.
2979000	2982000	Better go to bed and work tomorrow.
2982000	2986000	So we're back in the studio and we've got food figured out.
2986000	2989000	We're going to do that during the next break because they don't close as early as I thought they did.
2989000	2990000	Dark Soccer actually made a phone call.
2990000	2992000	That's good to know.
2992000	2993000	I like that.
2993000	2994000	So we're doing what, pizza tonight?
2994000	2995000	Yes.
2995000	2996000	Good.
2996000	2997000	The food of gamers.
2997000	2998000	That's right.
2998000	3000000	The food of gamers and the food of marathons actually.
3000000	3001000	All things considered.
3001000	3002000	All right.
3002000	3003000	Hopefully Dark Soccer got this.
3003000	3005000	I sent out a second show roll full of other stories.
3005000	3009000	Hopefully you saw that in your email.
3009000	3011000	That would be a good question.
3011000	3012000	Let me see.
3012000	3013000	Okay.
3013000	3014000	Take a look.
3014000	3017000	Because we're going to do some more stories for you guys.
3017000	3019000	Some things that actually missed the show roll originally.
3019000	3021000	We'll talk about those.
3021000	3023000	And then we've got more classic games of the week coming up.
3023000	3027000	And take some of your Facebook questions in the segment as well.
3027000	3031000	They're going to do Ask Orange Lounge I think while I'm gone in the next segment.
3031000	3033000	And some other stuff too.
3033000	3036000	And oops.
3036000	3037000	Hey.
3037000	3039000	How about some more DDR music?
3039000	3040000	Woo.
3040000	3041000	I think we heard enough of that during the break.
3041000	3042000	Sorry about that guys.
3042000	3043000	I think I only got one.
3043000	3044000	No.
3044000	3045000	I know.
3045000	3046000	I sent you one.
3046000	3047000	Take a look.
3047000	3048000	Oh.
3048000	3049000	No.
3049000	3050000	It.
3050000	3051000	Because it.
3051000	3052000	Compressed.
3052000	3053000	There it is.
3053000	3054000	That's it.
3054000	3055000	That's it.
3055000	3056000	Open up the attachment.
3056000	3057000	No.
3057000	3058000	No.
3058000	3059000	Open up the attachment.
3059000	3060000	Down.
3060000	3061000	Down.
3061000	3062000	Supplement.
3062000	3063000	Yay.
3063000	3064000	Okay.
3064000	3065000	It's ugly but it works.
3065000	3066000	Alright.
3066000	3071000	And also if you want to send us comments or whatever.
3071000	3072000	Chat along with us.
3072000	3075000	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
3075000	3078000	So happy we found our way back in the chat.
3078000	3079000	Alright.
3079000	3081000	So Dark Sakura.
3081000	3082000	Well.
3082000	3083000	For firsties.
3083000	3085000	For people who love Sonic Adventure.
3085000	3086000	Like me.
3086000	3092000	On Xbox Live Arcade it will be $10 as of September 15th.
3092000	3095000	And that's really really sweet.
3095000	3097000	Sonic Adventure is probably one of my.
3097000	3100000	In fact the only probably good one of the three.
3100000	3101000	You know.
3101000	3102000	3D ones.
3102000	3105000	So I have to say that's pretty sweet.
3105000	3106000	And.
3106000	3107000	Apparently.
3107000	3111000	I just think this is funny and I want to read this from the article.
3111000	3114000	Because I snickered just now.
3114000	3116000	It's like.
3116000	3119000	We've contacted Sega to find out if the game will arrive on PSN on a similar timetable.
3119000	3121000	We also sent them an email with the subject line.
3121000	3122000	Give us C-man.
3122000	3128000	Followed by a body of text which essentially read C-man.
3128000	3129000	So.
3129000	3131000	Are you going to be downloading this to check out and play?
3131000	3132000	Or are you like.
3132000	3133000	Screw this I have the original.
3133000	3134000	Screw this game.
3134000	3135000	I'm kind of screw this I have the original.
3135000	3136000	Yeah.
3136000	3138000	But at the same time I would like to support it.
3138000	3141000	I sank so many hours into Sonic Adventure 2 for the Dreamcast.
3141000	3146000	And that's the one that had the little Tamagotchi Pokemon where you had your little babies.
3146000	3148000	The Sonic Adventure had them too.
3148000	3149000	Okay.
3149000	3150000	The Chao.
3150000	3151000	Yeah.
3151000	3153000	I sank about 30 hours into those things.
3153000	3154000	Because you have to like.
3154000	3155000	I don't know.
3155000	3159000	Breed them and they have the little bat wings or the little things you can get on them.
3159000	3161000	And you play with them on your VMUs.
3161000	3162000	On the VMU.
3162000	3163000	And I finally was like.
3163000	3166000	This is not the best game and I don't know what I'm doing.
3166000	3168000	So I stopped playing it.
3168000	3171000	No.
3171000	3173000	Imagine trying to play them in Japanese.
3173000	3177000	Aw that's kind of sad though that you stopped playing after all that.
3177000	3179000	Well my first Dreamcast was Japanese.
3179000	3180000	And we had Sonic Adventure.
3180000	3184000	So trying to make myself read it.
3184000	3188000	It was fun but yeah.
3188000	3189000	Alright.
3189000	3193000	Well another story for you guys about Xbox Live Arcade.
3193000	3194000	Aw crap.
3194000	3197000	I linked myself to the wrong story didn't I?
3197000	3198000	Son of a gun.
3198000	3200000	You need to talk more Sonic Adventure.
3200000	3203000	I lost my story.
3203000	3204000	Okay.
3204000	3207000	What was your favorite level in Sonic Adventure?
3207000	3209000	Running from the semi-truck.
3209000	3211000	That was Sonic.
3211000	3212000	Yeah Sonic Adventure 2.
3212000	3213000	That was it.
3213000	3216000	And then also that's the same semi-truck that is in the beginning of Bayonetta.
3216000	3217000	Really?
3217000	3218000	Yeah.
3218000	3219000	Cool.
3219000	3222000	Actually I love in Sonic Adventure it's the Sky Highway.
3222000	3223000	Or the Speed Highway.
3223000	3226000	Isn't Bayonetta full of all sorts of those types of inside jokes?
3226000	3227000	Yeah.
3227000	3228000	Would it say yeah?
3228000	3229000	Alright.
3229000	3230000	I got my story.
3230000	3231000	Yay.
3231000	3232000	This has to do with Trejar.
3232000	3234000	And I'm sure Dark Cycle will be very happy about this Trejar story.
3234000	3236000	It is a puzzle shooter.
3236000	3238000	You might know it.
3238000	3239000	Bangayo.
3239000	3243000	Bangayo HD is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.
3243000	3248000	It's Bangayo HD Missile Fury coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.
3248000	3251000	This game originally was on the Nintendo 64 and the Dreamcast.
3251000	3254000	But now it's being revamped and redone.
3254000	3259000	It was done before on the DS but DS is in your pocket.
3259000	3260000	This is on the TV.
3260000	3263000	It's on the big screen where everybody can see it.
3263000	3269000	So yeah there's going to be giant robots and lights and fruit and all that stuff that Bangayo
3269000	3270000	is famous for.
3270000	3273000	You can break out into a sweat trying to dodge 5,000 bullets in 1080p.
3273000	3274000	Yes.
3274000	3275000	And that's what Bangayo is all about.
3275000	3282000	My question is though, if Bangayo is going HD and all this, see it's horizontal.
3282000	3284000	Wasn't Bangayo another vertical shooter?
3284000	3288000	Those don't translate too well into the HD because it's the wrong proportion.
3288000	3293000	Unless you were able to turn your HDTV like on its side, then it might work a lot better.
3293000	3294000	I don't know.
3294000	3296000	Well they'll just have borders on the side like the final fight.
3296000	3298000	It always looks weird.
3298000	3299000	It always looks so weird.
3299000	3301000	Because that's like half the screen with those games.
3301000	3307000	Yeah to make them, well try playing, well some games though like I remember Galactic Attack
3307000	3314000	had a scrolling screen where you could scroll from side to side and it was just shorter
3314000	3316000	and maintain your proportion.
3316000	3317000	Alright.
3317000	3320000	By the way, this is the other cool thing about the game.
3320000	3323000	It's got 100 levels in the game so lots to play through.
3323000	3324000	But guess what?
3324000	3330000	If you finish all 100 levels and you decide, gosh I need something new to play, use the level editor.
3330000	3335000	You're going to get to build your own levels and share them on Xbox Live.
3335000	3336000	That sounds like fun.
3336000	3337000	There you go.
3337000	3339000	Bongai is a fun game.
3339000	3342000	So all this Dreamcast revival, good times.
3342000	3344000	Very good times.
3344000	3346000	It's full of happiness.
3346000	3356000	Well in other news, there is a game called Aero Cross High Air, the OFLC, the Australian rating thing.
3356000	3359000	It's one put out by Namco Bondi.
3359000	3368000	And it's actually the German USK rated Metro Cross High Air GP.
3368000	3376000	So looking this over, they're actually related from what I can tell.
3376000	3383000	Sorry I was looking this over.
3383000	3385000	No you have to remember the stories in this segment.
3385000	3390000	We didn't really prep in advance at all so it's going to be a little bit jankier than usual.
3390000	3392000	But it's live radio, what can you do?
3392000	3398000	Well it's saying that Metro Cross is supposed to be like a redo of that 1985 Metro Cross that Namco put out.
3398000	3404000	Which is a side-scrolling foot race and you avoid giant soda cans.
3404000	3407000	But what's Aero Cross?
3407000	3410000	Those soda cans are as big as that guy's torso.
3410000	3411000	Those are huge.
3411000	3414000	In fact the soda cans actually are as big as him, I believe.
3414000	3415000	Yeah.
3415000	3418000	Rob, can you jump over soda cans that are your size?
3418000	3419000	Um, probably not.
3419000	3421000	They look vaguely like Coke too.
3421000	3425000	Oh crap!
3425000	3426000	Wait, we're not to that story.
3426000	3430000	I know, I know.
3430000	3433000	Completely random thing, I want to go to our chatroom, chat.orangetownsready.com.
3433000	3437000	This is completely random and not on the show world but whatever, we have time to kill the night.
3437000	3443000	Robert M. is in chat and says, does iTunes still have the iMix user playlist or is that part of Ping now?
3443000	3445000	And why does that make me think of Bing?
3445000	3450000	One thing that Loki didn't mention during the show when he was talking about the iPhone and all those upgrades
3450000	3455000	is that Apple also announced their big new social network this week called Ping.
3455000	3457000	Has anyone been using Ping?
3457000	3459000	Alan, have you used Ping?
3459000	3463000	I'm on it. I added you and your former housemate.
3463000	3465000	And I haven't touched it since.
3465000	3471000	And my understanding is that it doesn't really aggregate data for you unless you're willing to buy music
3471000	3476000	because then it tracks your purchases or review albums and I do neither of those on iTunes.
3476000	3478000	So I have no idea what it's going to offer me.
3478000	3484000	I was thinking at first like the way they were demoing it, I thought Ping was going to be this like awesome replacement for Facebook
3484000	3491000	because it would be like Facebook but music oriented and then like no Farmville or any of those games that are on Facebook.
3491000	3496000	And don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for Farmville and Family Feud and Price is Right and all those Facebook games
3496000	3498000	but sometimes you don't want all that bullshit.
3498000	3505000	And I was also thinking that like, oh, when they showed Ping, they showed that Lady Gaga was like one of the first people they got obviously
3505000	3509000	because she's like queen bitch right now, you got to have her for everything.
3509000	3515000	And one of the things they showed is that she posted a little video that looked like it was taped on an iPhone 4.
3515000	3518000	But that's not like an option in there for the users to use.
3518000	3520000	Like I don't know if that's something they're building in soon or what.
3520000	3522000	So it's like I don't understand the point of Ping.
3522000	3527000	You can't even write your own status update unless you're Lady Gaga or one of the like famous people on there.
3527000	3533000	So it's like you can use it to follow famous people and then like see what songs your friends are buying and make its own top ten list.
3533000	3536000	But otherwise it's kind of like what's the point? I don't get it.
3536000	3542000	I'm sure that either her or her label is being, I mean when she recommends an artist I'm sure it's really from her.
3542000	3549000	But if you buy it through the iTunes store, someone's making money for that referral for all the Gaga stans that buy what she says to buy.
3549000	3556000	I was hoping it was going to be something like Last.fm where you just play your iTunes, put it on shuffle, it'll track what you listen to.
3556000	3558000	Yeah I thought it was going to be Last.fm Killer.
3558000	3560000	And recommend music for you.
3560000	3562000	And have like a Facebook-y type thing integrated into it.
3562000	3565000	Yeah.
3565000	3573000	But no. It's none of that. It's just, hey here's all the shit your friends are buying so you can like make fun of them when they buy Spice Girls Greatest Hits.
3573000	3578000	Although you really should make fun of that guy because that's probably me and you know what? Stop hating.
3578000	3580000	Alright.
3580000	3586000	Let's see. Oh Jessica Harper's in our chat, our good buddy from Understadation Live.
3586000	3589000	Well that explains why she was at the Apple building a couple weeks back.
3589000	3592000	That's true. When she was at San Jose she was visiting the Apple building.
3592000	3594000	Now we know why.
3594000	3596000	She was getting her ping thing.
3596000	3599000	Ding. Wing.
3599000	3601000	Let's see.
3601000	3604000	Redertainment in chat says iTunes has had Genius Mixes for a while now.
3604000	3608000	That's not a bad way to discover music, although it's your own music.
3608000	3613000	Like the Genius Mixes run off your own, at least as far as I've seen, it's your own music library.
3613000	3618000	But it's like really cool. Like a lot of people I have fairly eclectic music tastes.
3618000	3625000	Like you know I have some Synth Pop for those days. I have some you know Alanis and you know Tori for my angsty lesbian days.
3625000	3630000	I have a variety of music in my collection. But the Genius Playlist is a good way to kind of like separate it.
3630000	3634000	Like I'll be like okay today I want to hear Tegan and Sarah and like everything that sounds like it.
3634000	3638000	And it'll kind of come up with a pretty decent mix.
3638000	3640000	So I don't know.
3640000	3642000	Let's see.
3642000	3650000	Ifarted in chat. Yes that's their name. Ifarted says Sky secretly bought Milli Vanilli songs. Admit it lol.
3650000	3656000	I'll admit it. I bought them back in 1990 or whenever they were like actually out.
3656000	3657000	I think I had a single.
3657000	3659000	That was 91 so we were like.
3659000	3660000	I was in junior high.
3660000	3666000	I was actually quoted in the junior high paper during the whole like debacle because they ran a story on it.
3666000	3672000	And I said something like well if they just released the names of the guys who really did it I'd still buy their music.
3672000	3674000	It's it's cool.
3674000	3678000	It's a bit more difficult giving someone shit for their music purchases when they're 14.
3678000	3681000	It's not impossible but you don't have as much cred.
3681000	3683000	Exactly exactly.
3683000	3685000	But just just just let's let's throw it back here a little bit.
3685000	3691000	You can all you can all thank the guy in chat that goes by Ifarted for this.
3691000	3704000	Just a little retro flashback for you guys.
3704000	3707000	Like in retrospect how obvious is their faking.
3707000	3708000	Like for real.
3708000	3713000	These guys are supposed to have also had a good voice on their own.
3713000	3716000	You know and they wanted to do their own stuff.
3716000	3718000	I need to hear the chorus.
3718000	3728000	They performed on an MTV spring break back when that was still going on and they actually used an actual LP for their lip sync and it skips.
3728000	3730000	It was like an Ashley Simpson thing.
3730000	3731000	Yeah.
3731000	3736000	So they were doing their choreography and the girl you know it's true was stuttering because I guess they couldn't afford a cassette.
3736000	3739000	Nice.
3739000	3742000	That's got to be slightly embarrassing.
3742000	3743000	All right.
3743000	3745000	So let's go back to some gaming news.
3745000	3747000	I'm sorry I got to shut off the Milli Vanilli for now.
3747000	3751000	Rhetortainment in our chat room says I can't give a 14 year old shit.
3751000	3753000	Watch me.
3753000	3754000	That's true.
3754000	3763000	There's some little shits at like golf land sometimes and I'm like the fuck I can't tell this kid what to do when he's like 14 years old and like thinks he's all like a badass.
3763000	3773000	It's like you know someday you're going to like be unemployed and hating life and fathering tons of babies and yeah I don't know.
3773000	3776000	My mom will roll you down with her Range Rover if you don't stop.
3776000	3777000	Exactly.
3777000	3778000	All right.
3778000	3783000	Hey back to gaming news from Milli Vanilli to Mario.
3783000	3788000	Apparently Nintendo is actually going to be bringing Super Mario All Stars to the Nintendo Wii.
3788000	3790000	That's an interesting rumor going around this week.
3790000	3795000	It's coming out October 21st for about 30 bucks US or 2500 yen if you will.
3795000	3799000	It is supposed to mark the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers.
3799000	3806000	This game first went on sale in Japan in September of 1985 and then of course it came out in North America a long time later.
3806000	3808000	That was of course the original Mario Brothers.
3808000	3817000	Now Mario All Stars came back in 93 and that was Mario, Mario 2, Mario 3 and the Lost Levels which was really Japanese Mario 2.
3817000	3825000	And in their cartridge they got our Mario 2 is Mario USA even though it was really Doki Doki Panic and I've gone cross-eyed.
3825000	3835000	Apparently the Wii reissue is going to have special packaging and there will be a little booklet and a CD of Mario music that will include stuff from the original game all the way to Mario Galaxy 2.
3835000	3839000	But no word if there are extra Mario games included with this.
3839000	3844000	Here's something interesting I think a lot of the journalists that are republishing the story are overlooking.
3844000	3848000	There were actually two Mario All Stars karts.
3848000	3854000	There was Super Mario All Stars and then there was Mario All Stars plus Mario World.
3854000	3856000	Actually all came on one kart.
3856000	3857000	It was a pack-in.
3857000	3858000	I saw it in the vault.
3858000	3863000	And then the Game Boy Advance got special reissues of each one.
3863000	3864000	True, true.
3864000	3866000	Oh yeah the advanced, yeah.
3866000	3874000	I think Mario Advance 2 is really Super Mario Bros. 3. They were out of order but they all got a GBA remake treatment.
3874000	3875000	They were really well done.
3875000	3887000	So I'm kind of curious are we just going to be getting the exact same Super Nintendo game like a virtual console game on disc is what this is starting to sound like.
3887000	3891000	Which is kind of ironic because most of these games are on virtual console.
3891000	3896000	Although they have better graphics and the re-release.
3896000	3898000	Or if it's going to be the whole thing and Mario World.
3898000	3901000	Because Mario World was one of the best Mario games they did period, you know.
3901000	3904000	Mario World was relatively epic.
3904000	3905000	Yes.
3905000	3909000	Like we don't want you to use emulators but we'll sell you the ROM on a disc for 30 bucks.
3909000	3911000	Exactly, exactly.
3911000	3913000	Or the virtual console you know buying all this.
3913000	3917000	Let's see if I bought Mario, Mario 2, Mario 3 those are all 5 bucks a piece.
3917000	3922000	Lost levels came out so it's actually 20 bucks just to buy the virtual console releases.
3922000	3925000	So you're paying 10 bucks for all the super dev graphics.
3925000	3928000	And I guess you are getting a CD full of music whatever.
3928000	3933000	It just seems like there ought to be a little bit more to this or some extra Mario games or something.
3933000	3935000	I mean come on it's the Nintendo Wii.
3935000	3937000	You have a lot of extra space to do stuff right?
3937000	3940000	Watch it and not have classic controller support.
3940000	3942000	Just because.
3942000	3945000	You got to use the Wii stick sideways.
3945000	3947000	Well if they put Mario World on it that won't work.
3947000	3949000	Cause there were 4 buttons.
3949000	3951000	You had the spinny jump and the...
3951000	3957000	Let's see Y was run, B was jump, X was spinny jump and A was...
3957000	3960000	I think also fireball or something.
3960000	3962000	I don't think it did anything really.
3962000	3964000	Anyhow.
3964000	3968000	Let's see moving on Dark Sakura.
3968000	3970000	You were laughing at some pictures you brought up earlier.
3970000	3972000	What's this all about?
3972000	3976000	They're fantastically filthy. At least I think they are.
3976000	3981000	It's these little additions that hook onto the Wii remote.
3981000	3984000	They are put out by Mojo Wejo.
3984000	3987000	And they are supposed to transform...
3987000	3989000	Mojo Wejo!
3989000	3991000	Well this is a quote.
3991000	3997000	Able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals.
3997000	4000000	Oooh.
4000000	4003000	They're vibrators.
4003000	4006000	They are interesting looking vibrators.
4006000	4008000	They're will-dos.
4008000	4010000	They're wee-dildos.
4010000	4014000	I have to show you chat room and I want to see what you think about this.
4014000	4020000	Would this be a turn on or a total buzzkill?
4020000	4025000	One of them looks like something you would use to pick up radioactive material.
4025000	4027000	Like it doesn't even really look like...
4027000	4029000	What's that supposed to do? Like pinch things?
4029000	4032000	No, I bet it's for fapping.
4032000	4034000	Oh wow.
4034000	4036000	Seriously, look at it.
4036000	4038000	It would be an adjustable little clamp that goes around your...
4038000	4042000	It's the claw.
4042000	4048000	Is it adjustable sizes? Cause you know I need extra large.
4048000	4049000	Why are you laughing?
4049000	4057000	I just looked over and saw Ellen give you a sideways look.
4057000	4062000	But at any rate, yeah. You know what though? One of these...
4062000	4067000	I don't think that I find that attractive.
4067000	4071000	Does it come with Purell?
4071000	4078000	It just wouldn't... I don't think that a wiimote would give off enough oomph.
4078000	4081000	Yeah, I don't know. What games are you going to be able to play with that?
4081000	4082000	That's what I want to know.
4082000	4086000	What's just some housewife with a big grin on her face flailing around the living room?
4086000	4090000	What are you doing? Oh, I'm playing WarioWare.
4090000	4093000	But your hands are free, yeah?
4093000	4097000	I'm playing the ping pong ball shooting level.
4097000	4101000	This is what it says on the Mojo Wejo website, okay?
4101000	4105000	The device is attached to the accessory port on a Nintendo Wii remote control.
4105000	4110000	The control is then connected to a Bluetooth enabled PC running Mojo Wejo software.
4110000	4114000	Using the Mojo Wejo patent pending Motion 2 vibration technology,
4114000	4119000	the device is able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals
4119000	4123000	and send them to another selected device in the same room or over the internet.
4123000	4126000	Wii gaming console not required.
4126000	4129000	Essentially turning your Wii remotes into shared remote controlled vibrators,
4129000	4133000	aka Wii vibrator or Wii-Bator.
4133000	4136000	That's from...
4136000	4138000	It kind of reminds me of the original.
4138000	4139000	There's a video.
4139000	4140000	Oh wow.
4140000	4141000	There's a video to this.
4141000	4144000	Oh, hooray.
4144000	4145000	Wait, I should play this over here so we can get the audio over the feed.
4145000	4146000	Yeah, you play it.
4146000	4147000	I've got my sound turned off.
4147000	4148000	Alright, that's okay.
4148000	4151000	We're going to play this over the feed here.
4151000	4152000	Where am I going?
4152000	4154000	Oh, here? The link?
4154000	4157000	Yeah, follow the link to SF Weekly.
4157000	4160000	Got it, got it, got it.
4160000	4162000	Okay.
4162000	4164000	I don't know if this has sound.
4164000	4167000	It's just kind of doing its thing.
4167000	4169000	It's drawn a little like unhappy face.
4169000	4171000	That's not really unhappy, that's the meh.
4171000	4172000	And now it's like...
4172000	4173000	And now it's very happy.
4173000	4174000	I'm super happy.
4174000	4176000	Because I'm playing the Nintendo Wii,
4176000	4179000	but I have this box that says Mojo Wiijo.
4179000	4184000	And now my Wii has a little accessory that I shake.
4184000	4186000	It's making a little shaky thing.
4186000	4189000	And I'm waiting for something interesting to happen here.
4189000	4190000	What's it doing?
4190000	4192000	It's transmitting to the computer.
4192000	4193000	It is.
4193000	4196000	Then it's transmitting back to the Wii mode and it starts shaking.
4196000	4198000	And now the eyes are turning all different colors.
4198000	4200000	That is kind of scary.
4200000	4201000	You know what it looks like?
4201000	4204000	Well, from what I'm getting on here, it's so that you can...
4204000	4205000	It's for cybering.
4205000	4207000	It's for cyber sex.
4207000	4210000	It runs off the Bluetooth in your computer.
4210000	4211000	That's what it is.
4211000	4214000	It's just using the Wii mode as like, hey, who doesn't have a Wii mode?
4214000	4215000	So here's what you do.
4215000	4216000	You get on your...
4216000	4218000	I'm just explaining this like I know.
4218000	4225000	You get on your PC and you find someone you want to do some naughty things with online.
4225000	4227000	And then you take the Wii mode and put on the attachment.
4227000	4232000	And, you know, attach it.
4232000	4238000	And then you go on the chat room and you put like, oh, baby, I am so hot right now.
4238000	4239000	Like, push the button.
4239000	4242000	And then they push the button and you're like, ooh.
4242000	4249000	Instead of typing, I am having so much trouble typing right now, it would be like, you know,
4249000	4252000	VRQ would be all scrambled.
4252000	4262000	Because, you know, and then you'd have to get one of the little plastic covers for your monitor.
4262000	4266000	You remember when people always had the little plastic covers for their keyboard and everything?
4266000	4268000	And we used to just call it the jizz guard.
4268000	4269000	Yeah.
4269000	4270000	Splash zone.
4270000	4272000	Good times.
4272000	4274000	Or you just play rez with it, honestly.
4274000	4277000	That's really what that's made for.
4277000	4280000	You have amused Tara with your explanation.
4280000	4281000	Good.
4281000	4284000	All right.
4284000	4292000	Well, speaking of sensual video games, the Wii Balance Board is now supported in a massage game.
4292000	4294000	Oh, you're going to love this, Dark Saga.
4294000	4295000	Ooh.
4295000	4297000	Called Love Press Plus Plus.
4297000	4300000	This looks like the type of massage game that has happy endings.
4300000	4305000	Not the type of massage you paid good money to go to school to learn.
4305000	4308000	It's going to be shown off this month at the Tokyo Game Show 2010.
4308000	4310000	It's a massage game called Love Press Press.
4310000	4321000	It's by Shirai Labs, and it uses massage recognition to stimulate the physical communication of lovers.
4321000	4323000	Right.
4323000	4327000	You choose a virtual partner, and you can pick from various shapes and ages.
4327000	4332000	Although I somehow doubt there's old fatties.
4332000	4337000	The shapes are skinny and skinnier probably, and the ages are like young or 18.
4337000	4338000	No gilfs.
4338000	4342000	Because, like, real people don't ever be in these games.
4342000	4344000	Let's see.
4344000	4350000	Supposedly the game is not supposed to be sexual in nature, although the picture definitely doesn't give me that impression.
4350000	4358000	The game is supposed to give off audio cues like, stop, where are you touching?
4358000	4360000	Creepy.
4360000	4361000	Wow.
4361000	4362000	There's actually an announcement.
4362000	4363000	You know what, Rob?
4363000	4366000	There has to be one line in that game that's in every hentai.
4366000	4373000	Look, here's this guy playing the game, and it just looks like he's having anal sex with a balance board is really what it looks like to me.
4373000	4375000	I mean, tell me I'm wrong.
4375000	4376000	No.
4376000	4378000	But he's having anal sex with a balance board, and somehow that's massage.
4378000	4380000	Let's link that in the chatroom and put it to a quick vote.
4380000	4382000	Okay.
4382000	4383000	Quick poll in our chatroom.
4383000	4385000	Anal board sex, Y-N.
4385000	4387000	Go to the following link.
4387000	4389000	Is that man having wee board sex?
4389000	4390000	Anal sex, hold on.
4390000	4395000	Let me type that in bold.
4395000	4400000	I have to vote too.
4400000	4402000	Maybe the longer we broadcast, the dirtier we get.
4402000	4403000	I don't know.
4403000	4404000	I don't know.
4404000	4410000	Some hospitals in Japan are going to get way more weird emergency room visits than they're used to due to this game.
4410000	4414000	It pinches.
4414000	4415000	But you see what he's doing?
4415000	4419000	He's massaging the board like it's supposed to be somebody's back.
4419000	4420000	Okay.
4420000	4426000	Now, this actually goes to something which is a kind of a recent, and I've actually been reading sociological articles about this.
4426000	4428000	That there's been this-
4428000	4429000	About this?
4429000	4430000	No, it has to do with it.
4430000	4431000	Anal sex with wee balance boards?
4431000	4432000	It has to do with it.
4432000	4434000	You read a lot.
4434000	4435000	Hi, it's me.
4435000	4438000	If there's information to be learned, I learn it.
4438000	4448000	But there's actually been this big, and they've been interviewing people who are becoming less and less outwardly social, preferring to stay at home more often,
4448000	4452000	who basically don't want sex.
4452000	4456000	I guess companionship, but not like with a real person.
4456000	4458000	Like this one guy married his doll.
4458000	4460000	Also the guy who married the DS, right?
4460000	4462000	Oh, the one guy who married his DS.
4462000	4464000	But it's been this social thing lately.
4464000	4480000	Actually, well, I was reading, I was doing some, looking up some stuff about birth rates dropping, and they had that as a link in regards to birth rates dropping in Japan.
4480000	4485000	And I was like, well, you know, isn't this just what we hear about, you know, kind of, you know, fringe behavior?
4485000	4486000	It's not the norm.
4486000	4491000	But apparently it's becoming either more of a trend or more of a public knowledge type thing.
4491000	4496000	So this still totally doesn't surprise me.
4496000	4502000	Sorry, I'm just looking at this because they actually put on here, they put tweet love press to give your comments.
4502000	4504000	I'm trying to see what comments, but it's all-
4504000	4505000	We have a new president, Kat.
4505000	4506000	Hey, wait a minute.
4506000	4509000	Like all the results are like more than two days old.
4509000	4510000	What is this?
4510000	4514000	We don't have enough, well, we don't have enough people tweeting love press.
4514000	4518000	I think we need to change that.
4518000	4521000	It looks like everybody has tweeted love press two days ago.
4521000	4522000	Well, now we-
4522000	4529000	And Redertainment, yes, I am very familiar with the term and I wasn't going to bring that up, but that's actually been, again, coming up.
4529000	4530000	Asexuality.
4530000	4531000	Yes.
4531000	4537000	So I think you guys need to tweet about the love press and, you know, how you can't wait for the anal sex we balance board game.
4537000	4540000	All right, the results of our quick poll are in.
4540000	4541000	Here we go, let's see.
4541000	4543000	Yes, I'm sorry, the quick poll again.
4543000	4546000	Is that man giving anal sex to the balance board?
4546000	4547000	Yes, he is.
4547000	4548000	Yes.
4548000	4549000	Yes.
4549000	4550000	Yes.
4550000	4551000	That's some butt sex right there.
4551000	4552000	Yes.
4552000	4553000	Yes.
4553000	4554000	Frown.
4554000	4555000	Oh, baby.
4555000	4556000	Oh, baby.
4556000	4557000	Yes.
4557000	4558000	Sadly.
4558000	4559000	Yes, he is.
4559000	4560000	Guys goes blind on a scale of one to ten.
4560000	4561000	I'm a fuck you now.
4561000	4562000	He's friending the wheeze.
4562000	4564000	You know, it looks like he's choking the person he's having sex with.
4564000	4565000	Kind of.
4565000	4566000	Yes.
4566000	4567000	Yes.
4567000	4568000	But he's raping it at the same time.
4568000	4569000	Anal sex rape o'clock.
4569000	4570000	There you go.
4570000	4571000	Those are the results of the quick poll.
4571000	4573000	But what if it's consensual?
4573000	4576000	What if the the balance board is consensual?
4576000	4577000	I don't know.
4577000	4578000	Then it's not rape.
4578000	4579000	Again, you need to tweet.
4579000	4582000	Right at the bottom of that page, it says tweet love press to give your comments.
4582000	4587000	I would like our listeners to send their comments on the love press over to the makers of the game.
4587000	4589000	They're waiting to hear your comments on love press.
4589000	4594000	If you take a towel and wrap it up and press it down on there, does it then become a waterboarding simulator?
4598000	4599000	I don't know.
4599000	4601000	That's a good question.
4601000	4602000	All right.
4602000	4603000	So there you go.
4603000	4604000	There's another sensual game.
4604000	4605000	But it's not it's not real.
4605000	4606000	It's not sexual.
4606000	4609000	It's just, you know, going to teach you how to massage.
4609000	4611000	You know, I hate the term happy ending, by the way.
4611000	4612000	I know you do.
4612000	4613000	Which is why I say it all the time.
4613000	4617000	That is not I'm not going to I'm not going to get on my high horse about this.
4617000	4618000	Is OK.
4618000	4619000	Hold on.
4619000	4620000	I have two questions.
4620000	4624000	Is it something that would typically be done at the end of the session?
4624000	4625000	Yes.
4625000	4628000	Is it going to make the recipient happy?
4628000	4629000	Yes.
4629000	4631000	Therefore, it's a happy ending.
4631000	4638000	I know it's all offensive and shit to massage people who, you know, take the art of massage very seriously.
4638000	4652000	But, you know, on top of that, it's the other reason why we're running into all this legislation going around now, trying to put police officials on the board of massage therapists in California who have no nothing about it.
4652000	4660000	As gamers, they're trying to say that M-rated games shouldn't be sold unless they have all these restrictions or games or porn and all this stuff.
4660000	4661000	It's fun.
4661000	4662000	Stick it to the man.
4662000	4663000	That's right.
4663000	4669000	Have you seen Dark Seeker, the YouTube where this masseuse is like, oh, would you like happy ending?
4669000	4670000	And the guy says, yeah.
4670000	4674000	And all of a sudden, like, balloons fall out of the sky and clowns come out.
4674000	4678000	He's like in his towel clapping like, yay.
4678000	4679000	I should I should see that.
4679000	4682000	That sounds now that's funny.
4682000	4684000	That sounds entirely too amusing.
4684000	4685000	Do you know how to find that?
4685000	4687000	You know what I would look up?
4687000	4688000	We got a marathon show.
4688000	4689000	I can look up YouTube.
4689000	4690000	It's fine.
4690000	4691000	Happy ending parody.
4691000	4693000	I don't know.
4693000	4696000	I could probably tell what it is from the cap.
4696000	4697000	No.
4697000	4698000	Oh, this one.
4698000	4699000	Happy ending.
4699000	4700000	Massage HD.
4700000	4701000	Uncut original version.
4701000	4702000	Is that it?
4702000	4705000	This girl's got big titties.
4705000	4706000	Now I want to just see this one.
4706000	4708000	I don't know.
4708000	4714000	Just going to meet that a little bit.
4714000	4716000	Oh, this is like soft core right here.
4716000	4717000	That's hot.
4717000	4719000	Dang.
4719000	4721000	This is awesome radio, by the way.
4721000	4724000	I just want to say that's because we're amazing people.
4724000	4725000	Orange.
4725000	4726000	Oh, no, it is.
4726000	4727000	This is it.
4727000	4728000	This is it.
4728000	4729000	Orange lunch.
4729000	4730000	Cinemax.
4730000	4731000	Okay.
4731000	4732000	Hold on.
4732000	4733000	Hold on.
4733000	4734000	You have to watch the star.
4734000	4736000	Look at that massage.
4736000	4738000	Look at that.
4738000	4746000	Uh, is that the type of outfit you wear when giving massages?
4746000	4750000	No, I'm a fan of sweat pants and a t-shirt.
4750000	4752000	There's a sign therapeutic massages only.
4752000	4755000	No police allowed.
4755000	4766000	This sounds like every Chinese restaurant in America, by the way.
4766000	4767000	Right?
4767000	4768000	I know.
4768000	4775000	I think they all have the same CD or there's like, okay, forget it.
4775000	4782000	Do you want happy ending?
4782000	4786000	You have a dollar.
4786000	4787000	Okay.
4787000	4788000	Okay.
4788000	4789000	Happy ending.
4789000	4794000	Hahahahaha.
4804000	4808000	Hahahahaha.
4808000	4810000	Huh, you happy now?
4810000	4813000	Well it really wasn't what I was hoping for.
4813000	4815000	Oh no....
4815000	4818960	Oh, maybe you want a hand job.
4818960	4820800	$50.
4820800	4823520	For a hand job, right?
4823520	4826520	Yeah, hand job.
4826520	4828160	Yeah, OK.
4828160	4830760	OK.
4830760	4831320	Hand job!
4838200	4840040	And they're all in Greece outfits.
4840040	4842200	That's fantastic.
4842200	4845360	He's doing it, too.
4845360	4847800	Hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job.
4847800	4849720	That was amazing.
4849720	4853240	Thank you, Alan, for bringing that into my life.
4853240	4854080	I like that in chat.
4854080	4856320	Oh, chat room, how you have missed out.
4856320	4858000	For those listening on the podcast,
4858000	4861320	YouTube user is Mediocre Films.
4861320	4862760	There it is, Mediocre Films.
4862760	4865640	And it's called Happy Ending Massage.
4865640	4867840	It was brilliant.
4867840	4869320	Love that.
4869320	4871040	Oh, hey, video game news.
4871040	4873080	Once in a while here on the Orange Lounge Radio.
4873080	4875120	Dark Sakura, got anything for us?
4875120	4877800	Oh, yes, not yet.
4877800	4883360	OK, well, Kirby's Epic Yarn, OK, they're
4883360	4887160	saying there's a video, a commercial, that
4887160	4892280	was an inspiration for Kirby's Epic Yarn.
4892280	4897600	I'm trying to look at a stop motion movie.
4897600	4898920	OK, this I've got to see.
4898920	4901480	And yeah, we haven't rehearsed any of this.
4901480	4904600	So I'm trying to see what this was.
4904600	4906160	It's OK, we got lots of time to kill it.
4906160	4909240	It's a stop motion animation of somebody doing Kirby's Adventure
4909240	4909840	in yarn.
4913280	4914440	I'm going to quote this.
4914440	4919760	OK, it came from, the original idea
4919760	4921520	came from Steph at Good Feel, which
4921520	4924760	was inspired by a stop animation film made primarily with yarn,
4924760	4925720	explains Ellis.
4925720	4927480	I'm reading off Destructoid.
4927480	4929680	With the ability for players to interact with the game's
4929680	4932520	environment, such as unzipping the background panels,
4932520	4936360	Kirby's Epic Yarn is really its own category as a platformer.
4936360	4940400	So they're saying that nobody at Nintendo of America
4940400	4941360	knew what it came from.
4941360	4948240	So I'm seeing if this is perhaps the, yeah,
4948240	4950400	this was a stop motion animation commercial
4950400	4955080	that came out in Japan for Kirby's Adventure.
4955080	4957440	All done with yarn.
4957440	4959760	Yarn style, that's kind of cool.
4959760	4961320	It's really cute.
4961320	4963560	Isn't it amazing what the internet will unearth?
4963560	4965960	Like, if you have an unoriginal idea, at some point,
4965960	4967280	the internet will find it.
4967280	4968200	You know what I mean?
4968200	4969160	Man, Kirby sure sucks.
4969160	4970920	He doesn't even realize it.
4970920	4973480	No, he does, though.
4973480	4975000	Aww.
4975000	4977280	See, that's such a cute, why don't we get cute commercials
4977280	4978040	like that, Rob?
4978040	4979280	Explain it to me, please.
4979280	4980880	You're not watching enough cartoons.
4980880	4981640	That's what it is.
4981640	4983800	No, we don't have cool commercials anymore.
4983800	4986240	How does a hipster play Kirby?
4986240	4986760	How?
4986760	4988480	Without inhaling any powers, because it's
4988480	4991160	a pure experience.
4991160	4992960	Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh.
4992960	4994800	All right, do you want to do that story
4994800	4996920	on the third night's game you skipped over?
4996920	4997440	I did.
4997440	4999320	Did you, or did you do that one?
4999320	5002040	I opened everything up in order.
5002040	5003720	Did I link the same story twice?
5003720	5004920	Oh, crap.
5004920	5006920	No, I just linked the same thing twice.
5006920	5007680	Sorry about that.
5007680	5008480	Skip that story, then.
5008480	5009240	I'll do these two.
5009240	5010520	Oh, so yeah.
5010520	5011520	Yeah, it's the wrong link.
5011520	5012920	I screwed up, blah, blah, blah.
5012920	5014040	Well, thanks, Rob.
5014040	5015600	You're welcome.
5015600	5017320	Well, now you've got to do two stories in a row.
5017320	5018120	Fine.
5018120	5018760	I'll do three.
5018760	5019240	Fine.
5019240	5019840	Fine, do it.
5019840	5020440	I don't care.
5020440	5026800	007, a slew of pre-order items for GoldenEye 007 coming out
5026800	5027640	on the Wii.
5027640	5029400	GameStop, if you get the game there,
5029400	5031560	you're going to get invisibility mode
5031560	5034840	will be unlocked in the game for split screen multiplayer.
5034840	5037520	Each player will be invisible for a set amount of time,
5037520	5039680	allowing you to sneak up on each other.
5039680	5041720	If you go to Best Buy, you're going to get a tag
5041720	5044400	mode for split screen multiplayer.
5044400	5046800	Apparently, if a tagged player gets tagged or whatever,
5046800	5049600	you can't kill another player without first tagging someone
5049600	5050440	else.
5050440	5052120	Now, Activision says that these codes
5052120	5055040	are exclusive until the end of the year,
5055040	5057120	but then I don't know what happens with that.
5057120	5059480	So maybe they're going to, I don't
5059480	5062200	know if they're codes you put into the game, which will end
5062200	5064040	up on the internet everywhere, or if it's
5064040	5066480	some type of DLC, which doesn't make sense,
5066480	5068600	because Nintendo Wii doesn't do a lot of DLC.
5068600	5069960	Although, there's some.
5069960	5073560	Like, the Final Fantasy IV game has some DLC in it.
5073560	5075960	But yeah, that's strange.
5075960	5077920	Oh, by the way, if you get the game at Walmart,
5077920	5082480	you get a t-shirt that says Cheater with an Odd Job hat.
5082480	5084960	Now, that you can't get with a code, so I hate to say it,
5084960	5089080	but Walmart seems to be the best place to get this game.
5089080	5091160	So there you go, a little Odd Job hat says Cheater.
5091160	5094400	Well, that's because anyone who uses Odd Job is a cheap bitch.
5094400	5097240	No, Odd Job is awesome, and you just can't deal with it.
5097240	5102520	All right, by the way, one of the original developers
5102520	5104520	has some interesting things to say about this.
5104520	5108200	Martin Hollis, he was with Rare when the original GoldenEye
5108200	5110080	came out on the Nintendo 64.
5110080	5113080	He says, quote, I imagine it's a business decision, isn't it?
5113080	5115720	This is an interview with an official Nintendo magazine.
5115720	5116920	This name is valuable.
5116920	5117760	Let's use it.
5117760	5120280	I find it hard to picture Activision's top management
5120280	5123200	being excited about the original and wanting to do it justice.
5123200	5124960	In fact, I find it hard to imagine them
5124960	5126680	being excited about any game.
5126680	5130040	It's my perception that they are trying to be EA, only more so.
5130040	5131960	I think they're doing a fine job with that.
5134840	5136320	I know, right?
5136320	5138560	He's a little irritated there.
5138560	5141680	Now, he does say nice things about the developers themselves.
5141680	5144920	He says, quote, they are a good company.
5144920	5148400	I'm confident they've done their very best.
5148400	5153040	So he's not letting his nastiness go over
5153040	5155760	to the developers, but it's all about the money grabbers
5155760	5156600	at Activision.
5156600	5158000	You know what's funny is that that's
5158000	5160300	what hella people have been saying about Activision lately
5160300	5160800	anyway.
5160800	5164720	So it's kind of funny that it came out that way.
5164720	5165560	So there you go.
5165560	5167600	All right, I guess I have to do another story now
5167600	5171520	because I couldn't link Dark Soccer's story, right?
5171520	5174040	Hey, Oddworld, Stranger's Wrath.
5174040	5178240	It's a remake coming to PSN in 2011.
5178240	5181520	It's a first slash third person shooter that originally came out
5181520	5183320	in 2005.
5183320	5186160	And you took on the role of the stranger.
5186160	5188520	But it was kind of like an Oddworld type of game.
5188520	5193480	You used ammo, animals, bugs, to actually take out enemies.
5193480	5195960	It's going to have updated visuals to 720p,
5195960	5199240	updated graphics, updated music, and all that stuff.
5199240	5203680	The dialogue in the game is also being remastered.
5203680	5209520	Is this the, I remember the last Odyssey game that came out,
5209520	5212840	where you're a cowboy, where you're actually a cow,
5212840	5215160	and you're shooting enemies first person shooter style.
5215160	5216880	And I remember it bombed horribly.
5216880	5219360	Is that what this is, remade?
5219360	5221080	But you're not a cow, I don't think.
5221080	5222320	No, it doesn't look like it.
5222320	5223520	Like a moose or something?
5223520	5224560	Someone in chattel knows.
5224560	5226720	How is a cow like a moose?
5226720	5231760	Well, they're both big and stinky.
5231760	5232520	All right.
5232520	5234880	Well, it's going to be 720p and all that good stuff.
5234880	5236720	They are targeting an Easter release.
5236720	5238760	One other thing that they're putting in the game,
5238760	5240760	PlayStation Move support.
5240760	5242600	So it's almost like a whole different game
5242600	5243720	from what it used to be.
5243720	5247000	Move with what Alan says.
5247000	5248880	Shut up.
5248880	5250840	I just can't.
5250840	5253720	I can't stop.
5253720	5256160	I remember when Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus
5256160	5258280	were going to be a part of this huge, like, seven
5258280	5260040	sequel sprawling epic.
5260040	5262440	And by, like, the fourth game, everyone
5262440	5264480	stopped caring about the storyline.
5264480	5266960	Robert Ammon Chat says, you're an alien bounty hunter,
5266960	5269840	I think, is what's going on there.
5269840	5271360	So there you go.
5271360	5275000	Developer Just Add Water is making that whole game.
5275000	5276720	It'll be fun, I'm sure.
5276720	5278400	I'm going to go check that out right now.
5278400	5281640	I'm pre-ordering it right now.
5281640	5282960	DarkSakura?
5282960	5286560	Oh, I was just thinking about pizza.
5286560	5289440	We'll take a break here in a minute and do the pizza stuff.
5289440	5294880	Well, as far as there's news for DJ Hero 2,
5294880	5299280	the RZA is in the cast of DJ Hero 2,
5299280	5303040	as in dude from Wu-Tang Clan, who also likes
5303040	5306640	to put out kung fu movies.
5306640	5309480	They've actually got images for his costume up here,
5309480	5313280	and I'm pulling those up to have a good look at them.
5313280	5314480	Pretty cool.
5314480	5317560	Yeah, that's him being motion captured for the game,
5317560	5318880	so that's actually pretty cool.
5318880	5322920	So yeah, fully digitized, going to be in the game.
5322920	5328840	And I'm just double checking to see if there's any other
5328840	5329360	tracks.
5329360	5331080	I've been tranced by the ice cream truck music.
5331080	5333080	Ice cream man, ice cream man, ice cream man.
5333080	5333800	He's right there.
5333800	5334680	Is he right up front?
5334680	5337400	I know it's kind of weird that it started showing up
5337400	5339800	like in the last year or so, the ice cream trucks
5339800	5340880	went driving by.
5340880	5342800	And if you buy ice cream once, they'll
5342800	5345120	come every day for like an entire year.
5345120	5349640	OK, he also did Mix Two Tracks, which is LL Cool J's I Can't
5349640	5351480	Live Without My Radio, and Grandmaster Flash
5351480	5353440	and the Furious Five's The Message.
5353440	5356680	And then the other one is Damian Marley's Welcome to Jam
5356680	5360000	Rock and Walter Murphy's A Fifth of Beethoven,
5360000	5362840	which was on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, which
5362840	5365000	I have two copies of on vinyl.
5365000	5366120	Because you're weird.
5366120	5368760	I got my mom's and my uncle's copies each.
5368760	5371320	It's all good.
5371320	5374400	And then there's also a Dollars and Cents Black Rock Track
5374400	5375680	for the game too.
5375680	5377840	But I just thought it was funny because the other article
5377840	5380520	mentioned the other game that he had been motion captured in,
5380520	5382840	and you know what that was, Rob?
5382840	5385440	Wu-Tang Shaolin style fighting game for PS1.
5385440	5388240	God, I remember that game.
5388240	5392160	Yes, it was like a, oh god, it was like the new Shaq-Fu.
5392160	5393760	But it wasn't really all that bad.
5393760	5397120	Remember that Def Jam, the rap fighting game,
5397120	5398600	there was one of those too?
5398600	5403160	Oh man, a lot of interesting stuff.
5403160	5404920	All right, Mega Man Universe.
5404920	5407480	More information was supposed to come out of PAX this week,
5407480	5409880	but I don't remember seeing anything additional on this.
5409880	5411920	Maybe somebody in chat can fill us in on this.
5411920	5413400	Here's the thing, there was a story
5413400	5414760	saying that more Mega Man Universe
5414760	5416800	information was going to be coming out,
5416800	5418720	because apparently they were giving away
5418720	5420400	some little things that look like, I don't know,
5420400	5425680	like little, I don't know what those are supposed to be.
5425680	5431920	Are those like, I have no idea what that is supposed to be.
5431920	5433040	Let me come look.
5433040	5438120	They're like little inflatable looking thingies.
5438120	5439480	With little pillows or something.
5439480	5441480	Oh yeah, they just look like little pillows.
5441480	5444160	Dude, the Ryu is kind of funny, but the Rock Man
5444160	5446400	looks like actually pretty cool.
5446400	5449920	So apparently some of the stuff at Capcom's booth
5449920	5451200	was supposed to be, you know, they
5451200	5453920	were supposed to be showing Mega Man Universe with more
5453920	5455840	trailers and game levels.
5455840	5458480	Ghost Trick, Okameda, and Resident Evil 5,
5458480	5461000	Bionic Commando Rearm 2, da da da.
5461000	5462720	I haven't seen a whole lot of information
5462720	5465640	since then coming out about this Mega Man Universe.
5465640	5467560	This is the last I'd heard of it anyway.
5467560	5468800	So I'm not sure if anything came out
5468800	5469680	within the past couple days.
5469680	5471340	Let me see if there are any updates today
5471340	5473640	after we did the show roll.
5473640	5475320	Oh, there is some footage, finally.
5475320	5475880	Yay.
5475880	5476840	OK, let's look at this.
5483400	5486000	Rob's giving us musical effects while he pulls up the footage.
5486000	5487240	Sorry.
5487240	5490840	How about I go, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5490840	5491560	Ready to mature.
5491560	5493560	Ah, stinking trailers.
5493560	5496400	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5496400	5498400	OK, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
5498400	5500880	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5500880	5502040	OK, are we ready?
5502040	5504240	No, we have to go by the sponsor message real quick.
5504240	5505520	So should I do more of the?
5505520	5506640	No, it's nine seconds.
5506640	5507440	We're good.
5507440	5509520	I totally forgot whose level I was doing.
5509520	5512040	Oh, Metal Man, I think.
5512040	5512640	OK, here we go.
5515640	5517680	ESRB, da da da, who cares.
5517680	5520240	Shut up.
5520240	5524240	Capcom logo, doo doo doo doo doo.
5524240	5525720	Aren't you all pretty now?
5525720	5528120	Konnichiwa, Mega Man creator.
5528120	5529560	Hi, I'm the creator of Mega Man.
5529560	5534520	Mega Man, you know, a lot of people who saw the first Mega
5534520	5538440	Man universe trailer are confused about wondering how
5538440	5541520	this game will play.
5541520	5544280	Since the trailer didn't reveal all that much.
5544280	5547240	Yeah, we sure we want to know you jerk.
5547240	5549040	He's here to clear up the confusion.
5549040	5550400	That's right.
5550400	5551600	The first playable video.
5554600	5556000	And you can see how it actually works.
5556000	5560000	Show me already.
5560000	5561800	I hope this video gets you excited and has you looking
5561800	5563440	forward to more.
5563440	5564600	Hurry up.
5564600	5567360	Why are you mad, though?
5567360	5569240	There we go.
5569240	5570640	In your arm.
5570640	5571720	Play as Rock Man.
5580320	5581560	Ooh, the graphics look cool.
5581560	5582840	Wait, isn't that Metal Man's stage?
5582840	5584080	Yes, it is.
5587080	5589000	That's Fire Man's stage.
5589000	5590040	This is the select music.
5590040	5592040	This is the character select music.
5592040	5593280	Well, the stage select.
5596160	5597720	And that's Crash Man's level.
5597720	5600840	Dude, this is like Mega Man 2 redone.
5600840	5601960	Oh, that's new.
5601960	5604640	A level that says Mega Man.
5604640	5605560	That's...
5605560	5608680	Play as Ryu.
5608680	5609680	No way.
5609680	5610680	No way.
5610680	5614000	You are Mega Fight.
5614000	5615880	He says your world Mega Fight.
5615880	5618560	So, OK, so some of the gameplay looks very Mega Man,
5618560	5623880	but then you see like this random Ryu.
5623880	5624880	What is that all about?
5624880	5626960	I've got to see if there's more.
5626960	5628360	Are these all just Mega Man?
5628360	5634480	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5634480	5635920	Are these all just the same?
5635920	5640920	Yeah, it's all the same trailer, I think.
5640920	5643920	Oh, no, they all got different gameplay trailers.
5643920	5645920	Ooh.
5645920	5650920	It's like different websites got different gameplay trailers.
5650920	5651920	That's Wood Man's level.
5651920	5654920	Dude, it's like a Mega Man 2 upgrade.
5654920	5656920	Plus some, I think.
5660920	5661920	Play as Ryu.
5661920	5662920	No way.
5662920	5665920	I'm going to see like actual one that actually shows.
5665920	5668920	Let's see what this trailer has in it here.
5668920	5671920	I think they're all going to be Mega Man.
5671920	5672920	Oh, my God.
5672920	5673920	Really?
5673920	5676920	There's no controls in it.
5676920	5680920	I do admit that he's actually really cute.
5680920	5681920	All right.
5681920	5684920	I'm not going to play that third one because we can't skip through it.
5684920	5685920	All right.
5685920	5687920	So it's a Mega Man type of like game.
5687920	5691920	Oh, so we say there's a triple video out there.
5691920	5695920	I'm looking at our chat room there.
5695920	5698920	It shows all three side by side.
5698920	5701920	Oh, let's see if I can get that.
5701920	5702920	Why not?
5702920	5704920	We have extra time because of the marathon show.
5704920	5711920	I'm going to do Mega Man universe triple video.
5711920	5714920	Okay, Mega Man universe triple video.
5714920	5716920	I don't see it.
5716920	5720920	I see official teaser trailer, which is that same thing we saw before.
5720920	5722920	This is wonderful radio.
5722920	5727920	Oh, shush.
5727920	5733920	You would think that they would have like actual like footage that's shown up from PAX, but I guess not.
5733920	5734920	Maybe it's not out there on the floor.
5734920	5736920	I don't know.
5736920	5737920	All right.
5737920	5738920	Well, whatever.
5738920	5739920	I'm over it.
5739920	5740920	Let's move on to some more news.
5740920	5745920	We'll get more information on this in the coming weeks, I'm sure.
5745920	5747920	Dark Sakura.
5747920	5749920	Other news.
5749920	5754920	How about EA actually trying to cover their ass?
5754920	5761920	They basically are trying to defend their whole stupid little online pass deal.
5761920	5766920	And there's a quote out here put by EA Sports dude Peter Moore.
5766920	5771920	Digital delivery, maintaining servers able to support that volume of people every 24 hours.
5771920	5773920	A solid billing infrastructure and customer support.
5773920	5776920	It all takes time, effort, and money, and we're at the cutting edge of that.
5776920	5783920	Online pass is a way of bringing more digital experiences quicker from day one, getting people new content.
5783920	5786920	Yeah, they're just saying this shit costs money.
5786920	5788920	We need more of it.
5788920	5789920	The end.
5789920	5790920	Yeah, we all need more money.
5790920	5791920	I want more money.
5791920	5795920	EA should give me $10 because I need to have money to buy their games.
5795920	5797920	They'd have to pay me to play their games.
5797920	5803920	I mean, well, not for Sims 3, but like for, you know, sports games.
5803920	5804920	You know what they need?
5804920	5805920	Huh?
5805920	5812920	They need, um, EA needs to put out Wii figure skating and you use the balance board.
5812920	5815920	And you have to balance to do all the tricks right on there with your Wiimotes in your hand.
5815920	5817920	That sounds hard.
5817920	5818920	That would be amazing.
5818920	5819920	I'd play that.
5819920	5823920	Speaking of amazing, this is probably the most amazing news story we've had all week.
5823920	5828920	Commodore USA is going to be making modern PCs, but in replica cases.
5828920	5830920	And I think that is like so badass.
5830920	5838920	Um, apparently the Commodore PC 64 will actually have an Intel Atom 535 processor with NVIDIA
5838920	5844920	Ion 2 graphics, four gigabytes of DDR3 RAM, a terabyte hard drive and a DVD-ROM optionally
5844920	5846920	upgradeable to Blu-ray.
5846920	5847920	That is so hot.
5847920	5851920	I actually kind of want one, but it's in a Commodore 64 replica case.
5851920	5856920	So you can party like it's 1983.
5856920	5857920	That's pretty cool.
5857920	5858920	Not a lot else with that.
5858920	5860920	I'm wondering, I don't see a price though.
5860920	5863920	That's the one thing I'd like to see is a price.
5863920	5864920	Let me see.
5864920	5866920	Nope, of course they don't say what it is.
5866920	5870920	I'm looking at the original press release here to see what it looks like.
5870920	5875920	It will have integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 6-in-1 media card reader.
5875920	5877920	Nope, no prices though.
5877920	5879920	Which means expensive.
5879920	5882920	Yikes.
5882920	5883920	Well, I'm still looking forward to it.
5883920	5885920	I don't know about you guys.
5885920	5888920	I see folks in chat room, ooh, want.
5888920	5890920	That sounds like it could be fun.
5890920	5892920	What do you have, DarkSakura?
5892920	5894920	Well, I have different news.
5894920	5897920	There was a game that the Burnout developers were going to be making.
5897920	5899920	Do you know what that was?
5899920	5900920	Skate or Die.
5900920	5902920	Do you remember Skate or Die?
5902920	5903920	I sure do.
5903920	5904920	Yes.
5904920	5914920	They were going to do it GTA style, apparently, instead of just having it be all tricks and stuff.
5914920	5916920	That would have been kind of cool.
5916920	5917920	I wonder why they canned it.
5917920	5921920	Did they talk about why it got canned or why they decided not to do it or what happened?
5921920	5926920	Well, EA and Criterion basically got on each other's asses again.
5926920	5932920	And so Criterion then went to do Need for Speed.
5932920	5937920	And it just looks like it just kind of fell through the cracks.
5937920	5938920	That sucks.
5938920	5939920	That could have been kind of cool.
5939920	5941920	I remember Ski or Die.
5941920	5943920	That was the quote-unquote sequel.
5943920	5949920	My BFF in grade school used to get blisters on the palm of his hands.
5949920	5955920	Like, really gross blisters from playing Skate or Die on his PC, his IBM.
5955920	5957920	And then I guess I think it was the halfpipe.
5957920	5961920	You had to roll your palm across the number pad to do the flips.
5961920	5963920	Used to get blisters from that game.
5963920	5964920	Oh my gosh.
5964920	5965920	Cool story, bro.
5965920	5967920	That just sounds nasty.
5967920	5970920	The one I remember, it wasn't Skate or Die.
5970920	5975920	I remember quite as fondly as I do 720, which was an Atari skating game.
5975920	5976920	Did you play this, Bradley?
5976920	5977920	Yes, yes.
5977920	5978920	I played it a bunch.
5978920	5980920	That's where you get chased by bees, if you're not fast enough.
5980920	5983920	I actually got to play it again at the California Extreme.
5983920	5984920	Oh, yeah?
5984920	5989920	Yeah, that was a hand killer just because doing the spin and the controller a bunch.
5989920	5992920	Yeah, because it was all trackball, right?
5992920	5993920	No, no.
5993920	5994920	It's a controller that goes around in a circle.
5994920	5995920	Oh, that's right.
5995920	5996920	Yeah, the controller's like...
5996920	5998920	But it doesn't stand up.
5998920	6002920	It's always tilted in one way, so it's really weird to control.
6002920	6005920	Well, that's the direction you go in when you skate.
6005920	6009920	You press the button to kick, and then you go in the direction that you have the joystick
6009920	6012920	in, and then you spin it around as you need to.
6012920	6015920	But then you would have these really epically long levels.
6015920	6018920	There was a very unique Atari hardware at that time, because there were other games
6018920	6020920	that looked very similar to it.
6020920	6022920	Like hard driving, I think, is one.
6022920	6025920	And the Indiana Jones game was on that same hardware.
6025920	6028920	There were a lot of Voca games Atari put out that all kind of ran on that same thing.
6028920	6029920	720.
6029920	6032920	I think it's in some of the Midway classic collections, too.
6032920	6033920	I do believe you are correct.
6033920	6034920	Yeah.
6034920	6035920	So I don't know why they got...
6035920	6038920	Oh, no, because they picked up the Atari arcade assets at some point, I think.
6038920	6039920	So...
6039920	6042920	And they should say, skate or die.
6042920	6043920	Yeah.
6043920	6044920	Very cool.
6044920	6048920	Well, the next story, this kind of came up earlier in the show, but I have it listed,
6048920	6049920	so I'll mention this.
6049920	6053920	Final Fantasy XIV, the beta was actually delayed a little bit.
6053920	6058920	It was supposed to start originally on August 31st, but they actually scheduled...
6058920	6062920	They had to delay it a day because of critical bugs and all this stuff.
6062920	6064920	But here's the crazy thing.
6064920	6068920	Like, you know, a lot of people have been having difficulty getting into the open beta.
6068920	6072920	There's been limited sign-ups and all this other stuff going on.
6072920	6075920	They stopped issuing beta codes.
6075920	6077920	They took down the installer altogether.
6077920	6078920	It's all crazy.
6078920	6083920	September 22nd is supposed to be the launch of this game.
6083920	6084920	Three weeks.
6084920	6087920	This game is supposed to launch.
6087920	6090920	That'll go over well, I'm sure.
6090920	6092920	So I don't know.
6092920	6096920	What made you decide not to get the Final Fantasy XIV beta, Alan?
6096920	6100920	Watching you play it and your less than stellar feedback of it when you played it.
6100920	6101920	Yeah, pretty much.
6101920	6103920	Were you interested in it before?
6103920	6106920	Well, yeah, I signed up when you did for the...
6106920	6108920	Oh, I thought you were just doing that for me.
6108920	6115920	Well, I mean, I'm into WoW now, so I've got enough interest in MMOs to at least check out the competition.
6115920	6117920	But you were playing MMOs before.
6117920	6118920	Wow, City Heroes, right?
6118920	6119920	Yeah, City Heroes.
6119920	6121920	But you never got Going Rogue, did you?
6121920	6123920	Have you read anything on it?
6123920	6129920	I checked Metacritic and I think Game Rankings the week it came out and it didn't have anything.
6129920	6133920	So I don't think that IGN and all the big review sites have treated it as a priority.
6133920	6136920	Maybe now there are some reviews up.
6136920	6139920	Well, let's take a look. We have a little time.
6139920	6143920	Because it was an actual standalone release, right?
6143920	6154920	Yeah, if you buy the Going Rogue edition, which is like $29.95, if you plug in that license, it's access to the whole game.
6154920	6157920	Yep, no one's reviewed it yet.
6157920	6159920	Yeah, none.
6159920	6161920	Wow.
6161920	6166920	Still going strong, but it's communities really underground. No one talks about COH anymore.
6166920	6168920	That's weird.
6168920	6173920	I see a comment from Ziba in our chatroom saying, I still say Guild Wars 2 for the win.
6173920	6178920	Yeah, after looking at that footage, Guild Wars was kind of like, I can kind of take it or leave it.
6178920	6185920	Like, Guild Wars was kind of a really cool game to just have on standby for those days you just don't want to play WoW anymore.
6185920	6188920	Like, oh, I'd fire up Guild Wars because I don't pay a monthly fee for this game.
6188920	6190920	It's a great game to have on standby.
6190920	6193920	I have, like, the Uber collection that went on sale on Steam or whatever.
6193920	6199920	But then Guild Wars 2, some of that gameplay footage came out, it looks awesome.
6199920	6203920	Like, I got to say, I'm really, like, it's all action-y and it looks really cool.
6203920	6207920	See, that's where, like, MMOs are going these days, is more action-y, and that's cool.
6207920	6211920	I'm really excited about DC Universe Online if I mentioned that.
6211920	6214920	Where's the beta for that? I want to play that.
6214920	6216920	Alright.
6216920	6219920	Dar Sakura, more news for us?
6219920	6221920	I do indeed.

6333920	6335920	And that's just so far.
6335920	6338920	People who are going to Tokyo Game Show, get me stuff.
6338920	6344920	I'd like to go like one day, just once to say I did it.
6344920	6347920	I'd like to go longer than one day so I can actually spend some time in Japan.
6347920	6350920	I meant like one day I would like to go, sorry, for the whole show.
6350920	6356920	Alright, this is another story about some big surprises, and I think this will make Alan very happy.
6356920	6362920	In an interview with PC Gamer, Gabe Newell from Valve, of course, has said,
6362920	6367920	I can guarantee you people are going to be surprised at stuff we do.
6367920	6370920	And this is after he already, are you rolling your eyes?
6370920	6376920	This is after they came out and said the whole Steam Cloud support on PS3 and all that good stuff.
6376920	6379920	But he said, quote, this isn't going to stop anytime soon.
6379920	6383920	I'm just laughing because people will be shocked again.
6383920	6389920	We have three big surprises in the next 12 months at least.
6389920	6390920	Thoughts on that, Alan?
6390920	6396920	If you are a Half-Life fan, you really aren't allowed to get mad at Gabe Newell and Valve,
6396920	6401920	because if you do, they might keep Half-Life in a closet forever.
6401920	6403920	It's very much an abusive relationship.
6403920	6407920	And of course, you know, all of the article, all of the blogs that are posting this story
6407920	6411920	have a picture of Gordon Freeman in his HEV suit.
6411920	6415920	I really hope it's something Half-Life.
6415920	6419920	Half-Life 2 came out six years ago.
6419920	6422920	Hey, it took 11 years for StarCraft 2, just saying.
6422920	6425920	Well, yeah.
6425920	6430920	And I only really play first-person shooters like Bioshock or Half-Life that have that narrative.
6430920	6436920	And the story, like the cliffhanger at the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was so epic.
6436920	6441920	It's like I'm a five-year-old on Christmas morning. I want that game.
6441920	6445920	Now, there was recently a trademark for Defense of the Ancients,
6445920	6451920	and that of course makes people speculate that there will be a real-time strategy game update to Defense of the Ancients.
6451920	6452920	So, don't know.
6452920	6457920	Well, yeah, that's that Warcraft 3 mod that Valve is trying to publish as their own thing.
6457920	6458920	Oh, really?
6458920	6459920	And Blizzard was like...
6459920	6461920	Oh, that's right, because they hired all those people, huh?
6461920	6463920	And Blizzard was like, LOL, no.
6463920	6466920	I think that's still in litigation right now.
6466920	6469920	Well, maybe they'll just change the name. Who knows?
6469920	6471920	Be interesting if that happens.
6471920	6475920	Maybe Left 4 Dead 3? I'm sure that would be a big surprise.
6475920	6477920	Oh, you're rolling your eyes over there. I see you.
6477920	6479920	Don't think I don't see you rolling your eyes.
6479920	6482920	Not a Left 4 Dead fan?
6482920	6492920	It's a great game, but I feel that they have other franchises they should focus on more promptly.
6492920	6497920	You don't want to see a new IP come out of Valve? The next Portal?
6497920	6502920	They should work on a damn thing until the next Half-Life. Like, they don't know.
6502920	6504920	You don't want to see Portal 3?
6504920	6510920	No, I will go to their office with a ruler and I will slap the little knuckles of their programmers' heads and go,
6510920	6512920	What are you working on? That's not Half-Life.
6512920	6516920	WAP. WAP. And then security will drag me out.
6516920	6520920	That is how I feel.
6520920	6521920	Promise.
6521920	6528920	How does Chat feel about this? Does Chat want their Half-Life? Either 3 proper or Episode 3 proper?
6528920	6536920	Monty Boggs in Chat says, I already forgot how Episode 2 ended. I should probably go back if they do announce a sequel.
6536920	6542920	Floppy Discourse in Chat says, Left 4 Dead 3 rocks.
6542920	6546920	It probably came out already because they have a six month development cycle on those games.
6546920	6549920	But yet Half-Life takes six years.
6549920	6554920	What do you think they're doing to this game to make it so... I don't know. I guess I shouldn't ask these questions.
6554920	6560920	I read the Half-Life 2 book that came out about how big Half-Life 2 was going to be.
6560920	6564920	Half-Life 2 for a first person shooter is a really long game.
6564920	6572920	All of the conceptual stuff where we want this set piece and we want this event to happen, it was going to be like an 80 hour game.
6572920	6578920	And they had to cut out all this stuff. So, same thing could be happening for Half-Life 3.
6578920	6581920	Red Entertainment in Chat says, I wanted Half-Life 2 years ago.
6581920	6585920	Dark Circuitry says, More Half-Life heart.
6585920	6591920	And Dark Tetsuya says, No, there's only one game I'm looking forward to in the immediate future and it's on the Wii.
6591920	6597920	I'm guessing that's the La Mulana game. Didn't that already come out? No, I guess it's still in the future. I don't know.
6597920	6606920	Haseo Sumi-Ragawa is looking forward a little more to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake that still has not been announced and probably isn't ever going to be.
6606920	6608920	I hate to be a DVD gamer.
6608920	6619920	I'm really disappointed that we haven't heard anything about a DS or even DS3D, 3DS, Final Fantasy 5 or Final Fantasy 6.
6619920	6624920	You know how they remade the SNES ones. Oh yeah, Final Fantasy 4 was awesome.
6624920	6630920	Yeah, it was amazing. I think 6 might be too big of a game, but they could do 5. It would sell really well here.
6630920	6639920	Or 6. Don't take this the wrong way, but fuck 5. 6 is really where it's at.
6639920	6647920	Put the hate mail down. I still like Final Fantasy 5, but Final Fantasy 6 is way up here.
6647920	6652920	Final Fantasy 5 is vanilla ice cream. It's good and I'm not going to turn it down.
6652920	6662920	It's cool, but Final Fantasy 6 is like peanut butter cups and chocolate ice cream.
6662920	6666920	It's like words I shouldn't say on the radio.
6666920	6671920	We're at 745. Do we need a break then?
6671920	6673920	Yeah, because the place closes at 9.
6673920	6678920	Okay, let's break after that story and we'll come back and we'll do a few more.
6678920	6680920	No, you guys are going to do Ask Orange Lounge, right?
6680920	6681920	Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.
6681920	6682920	But they should send them to you.
6682920	6683920	To me.
6683920	6686920	So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge with Dark Sakura.
6686920	6687920	Via private message.
6687920	6690920	And the Skype line will also be open for you guys if you want to do that.
6690920	6692920	Okay, I'll come over.
6692920	6699920	Okay, sounds good. So we're going to take a quick music break while we order dinner and then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.
6699920	6703920	So send your questions again. Not me. They won't get ready if you send them to me. Dark Sakura in our chat room.
6703920	6707920	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send in some questions.
6707920	6711920	We're going to take a quick break but we'll be right back with the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon Show.
6711920	6714920	We're like six hours in now almost. Oh my God.
6714920	6718920	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday.
6718920	6722920	It is September the 5th of 2010. It's Labor Day weekend.
6722920	6727920	We are starting to enter our sixth hour of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon Show.
6727920	6733920	If you're just joining us at All Games Radio where we do tape our show live every Sunday, it's a little different.
6733920	6736920	You may have missed last week's show where we told you guys we're going to be doing something special this week.
6736920	6745920	Loki has already come and gone. He was here at two o'clock for the quote unquote normal show that went until about 5.30 and now we're kind of in the bonus portion.
6745920	6751920	But now that we are getting into the really random stuff, we actually have to eat. We kind of have to like stop to eat.
6751920	6756920	So but we're not going to stop the marathon. I'm actually going to run out and get what's called take and bake pizzas.
6756920	6760920	So I'm going to get pizzas and then we'll switch off and Jamie's actually going to bake them while we do some other topics.
6760920	6762920	I'm going to bake them.
6762920	6766920	Well, you're the woman. I'm scared. I'll help.
6766920	6771920	I knew it was coming. I don't want to burn down your house either. That's what it really boils down to.
6771920	6774920	But we'll figure something out. We'll make some talking heads while Rob cooks.
6774920	6779920	All right. So anyway, I'm going to step out to go do that.
6779920	6785920	But Dark Sakura is going to take over. God help you all. And do some Ask Orange Lounge, right?
6785920	6792920	Yes. All right. So, of course, it wouldn't be Ask Orange Lounge if we didn't have a theme song, right?
6792920	6796920	We could do a duet. OK, no.
6796920	6803920	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
6803920	6811920	Don't ask me any questions because I'm leaving this house because I know how this segment can sometimes go.
6811920	6816920	I thought you were going to say sometimes suck.
6816920	6820920	Do I look like Wayne Brady? Do I sing improv songs on command?
6820920	6823920	Make life crew and get the fuck out my house, bitch.
6823920	6827920	All right. Sky says do the live feed while getting pizza. I could do the Ustream.
6827920	6830920	No, I'm not going to do that and drive at the same time. You guys are crazy.
6830920	6832920	All right. I'm out.
6832920	6835920	I would be forced to yell at Rob for doing something dumb.
6835920	6837920	Be good, kids. I'll be back.
6837920	6841920	OK. OK, chatlings, let's see.
6841920	6845920	Haseo Sumiragawa. What's the story with the orange bat?
6845920	6848920	Oh, shit.
6848920	6856920	The orange bat came from March Madness, which was a DDR tournament that they held at Milpitas Golf Land.
6856920	6870920	And it was me and Rob and Jessica and at the time her fiancé and I think and somebody else who was with us.
6870920	6871920	I don't remember.
6871920	6879920	But we decided that we were just sick of all the people not really doing actual routines and when they were doing their things.
6879920	6890920	So we actually went and got plastic orange bats and little toy trumpets and did stomp to my beat.
6890920	6896920	And Rob and I proceeded to hit each other over the head with bats while the others played the trumpets.
6896920	6901920	And it was epic. And then the bat went around and was signed.
6901920	6911920	And I think Rob has his bat and then I have my bat. And my bat, I got signed by everyone in Step Squad and RTF to as many people as I could.
6911920	6917920	So the bat is in my garage right now.
6917920	6923920	So that's the story of the orange bat.
6923920	6931920	Dark Circuitry asks, which is the better game, in your guys' opinion, Pump It Up Pro or In The Groove?
6931920	6933920	Pump It Up.
6933920	6936920	Because, dude, caution drop.
6936920	6940920	No, I'm not a big fan of In The Groove. It's OK. It's playable.
6940920	6943920	But Pump It Up, they're just different types.
6943920	6950920	I mean, same theory, yes, but different type of game, if that makes sense.
6950920	6955920	Pump It Up is one of the more major DDR clones where it's the diagonals.
6955920	6957920	It's the five square one.
6957920	6965920	Yeah, I tried playing that once and I was so in the mindset of DDR that I made it through two songs and it basically broke me.
6965920	6970920	Like the different mechanics of the diagonals. I couldn't do it. I didn't touch it since.
6970920	6973920	And I know people who are really, really good at it who do doubles on them.
6973920	6985920	So but I just remembered what the how the caution drop used to work on that is that you'd follow the diagonal, your knee would hit the middle and then you're like your foot would hit the top of the back and then you'd slap the bottom two on those four.
6985920	6987920	Oh, wow.
6987920	6990920	They had stuff where you had to hit all five buttons and it was really difficult.
6990920	6993920	So.
6993920	6995920	So, yeah.
6995920	6996920	Ranma.
6996920	6998920	Hi.
6998920	7004920	During OLRthon, how about firing up the Wii for multiplayer Mario Kart or the 360 for Rock Band 2?
7004920	7013920	Well, that's because Dan and Alex have taken over the front room and are shooting each other stupid in a first person.
7013920	7022920	Well, not a first person, but in the shooting game, a shmup against each other that we will not mention the name of in this house because it's not here.
7022920	7024920	Right.
7024920	7025920	Right.
7025920	7032920	But maybe we can maybe we can convince them to relinquish the television at some point.
7032920	7039920	You know what? It just occurred to me it's eight o'clock. We've been going for six hours now.
7039920	7041920	We are awesome.
7041920	7043920	What's the target time? 1am, 2am?
7043920	7044920	Whenever.
7044920	7045920	Whenever.
7045920	7049920	Midnight is the baseline, I think.
7049920	7052920	Hoof hearted. I guess you like horses, huh?
7052920	7055920	Oh, it's Spazinator.
7055920	7057920	Your thought on this.
7057920	7058920	OK.
7058920	7065920	It's a one terabyte hard drive for 80 bucks.
7065920	7066920	OK.
7066920	7067920	Go for it.
7067920	7073920	It's not it doesn't transfer for 80 megabytes per second plug and play.
7073920	7074920	Not bad.
7074920	7075920	It's not great.
7075920	7079920	I mean, not like the super most awesome thing in the universe, but.
7079920	7082920	Hey, cheap terabyte hard drive. Why not?
7082920	7093920	I think last January or February, I got a terabyte external FireWire USB thing like that for about one hundred and ten to show how cheap hard drive space is becoming.
7093920	7097920	But I use it as my MP3 slash Torrance drive.
7097920	7103920	Yeah, I've actually filled up my 500 gig with MP3s and movies and stuff.
7103920	7104920	Yeah.
7104920	7109920	And a whole bunch of obscure Japanese Sendai TV.
7109920	7111920	Because I like my Tower Rangers.
7111920	7113920	I think your mic's cutting out.
7113920	7116920	Ah, no cutting out, Mike. You're not allowed.
7116920	7120920	So next question and thank you, Spazinator.
7120920	7123920	That that looks like it would be a decent purchase.
7123920	7128920	Floppy discourse.
7128920	7129920	Ah, funny.
7129920	7131920	Floppy discourse.
7131920	7133920	When is Final Fantasy 14 coming out?
7133920	7136920	I don't know and I don't care.
7136920	7142920	I think the PC date is, I think Rob just said it, the 23rd, 24th, three weeks.
7142920	7143920	Yeah.
7143920	7147920	We're supposed to have 14 available for PC in three weeks.
7147920	7152920	I've completely lost interest in the Final Fantasy Online series.
7152920	7154920	It's gorgeous. Beautiful.
7154920	7158920	But pretty does not necessarily mean good.
7158920	7161920	And I'm happy with my Star Trek.
7161920	7164920	Prettier just means on a PC that not that many people can play it.
7164920	7166920	Yeah, really.
7166920	7169920	So a lot of people are holding out for the PS3 version.
7169920	7172920	Um, Geovdia.
7172920	7174920	I have nothing to ask. I know it all.
7174920	7175920	Mwahahaha. Anyway, hi.
7175920	7176920	Hi!
7176920	7178920	Hi.
7178920	7179920	Goldanthro.
7179920	7182920	What was the first video game you ever played in your life?
7182920	7187920	Pinball tables don't count, but feel free to say what those are too if you remember.
7187920	7189920	My first video game.
7189920	7192920	Pong. Seriously.
7192920	7195920	I played Pong when I was little.
7195920	7201920	And then later on we went on to Kangaroo and Popeye and Donkey Kong.
7201920	7207920	Um, I got an Atari 2600 when I was four or five, I don't know, so any one of those games.
7207920	7209920	Probably Pac-Man, I'd say.
7209920	7211920	Oh, the Pac-Man version was awful though.
7211920	7213920	Yeah, bong bong.
7213920	7216920	But not as bad as E.T.
7216920	7220920	Yep, and I played the hell out of that game because when you're seven you don't really have taste.
7220920	7221920	You don't taste.
7221920	7225920	With that Pac-Man there was like, I don't know if there was like a setting or something.
7225920	7231920	After a while it was a weird thing where the power pellet moved to somewhere else other than the middle of the board.
7231920	7234920	It was like I had no idea how it happened.
7234920	7236920	Programming glitch.
7236920	7247920	The first thing I played I remember was when I got the Atari 2600 for I think it was the fourth Christmas when I was like four and then we played Asteroids first.
7247920	7254920	Because I remember the big splashy colored Asteroids floating around the screen.
7254920	7259920	That's pretty cool. That's a good game to have as your first. Pong is kind of boring.
7259920	7265920	Bong. Bong. Bong. Bong.
7265920	7275920	Okay. As far as pinball tables, I played all kinds of pinball when I was a kid so it's really hard to remember.
7275920	7279920	The first one I remember playing was, my dad had one called Genie.
7279920	7281920	No, which one?
7281920	7282920	It was called Genie.
7282920	7284920	Oh, one of the 50's ones or 60's ones?
7284920	7286920	Something like that. I don't really know.
7286920	7289920	Little rotating numbers?
7289920	7303920	I'm not sure if it was electronic or rotating. I think it was actually electronic numbers because I would remember because my dad got one that he has right now that I don't know.
7303920	7305920	Actually he might have gotten rid of it in his new house.
7305920	7308920	Found it by Gottlieb.
7308920	7316920	Genie, 1979, four player and it is indeed electronic. Is that it?
7316920	7324920	Yep, that's it. And it played like the place in France where the naked ladies dance.
7324920	7330920	There's a hole in the wall where the guys can see their mom.
7330920	7332920	Yeah, that was just a track sound.
7332920	7337920	I'll link that in the chat room.
7337920	7342920	I was hoping I might see it at the California stream but no they didn't have it.
7342920	7349920	You might be able to find it though when they do that other pinball expo, Pacific Pinball Expo.
7349920	7355920	They might have them there because they usually have older tables there.
7355920	7361920	But I really can't remember what my first pinball was and it was something old.
7361920	7366920	Now what's your first video game you've played in roller skates?
7366920	7369920	I think it was Contra.
7369920	7372920	I think it was Frogger.
7372920	7373920	Roller skates?
7373920	7374920	In roller skates.
7374920	7376920	I've never roller skated.
7376920	7378920	Ah!
7378920	7384920	You know the people who spent a lot of time roller skating in middle school and high school.
7384920	7391920	If they can answer the question, you know they played a lot of games at the roller rink.
7391920	7393920	I didn't really go to the roller rink all that much.
7393920	7402920	I think it was when our swim team had rink parties where every so often we went to the skating rink during our season.
7402920	7406920	Either that or elementary school we went there.
7406920	7409920	After that it was over and we didn't go anymore.
7409920	7416920	When I would go visit my dad in Dothan, Alabama, the roller rink there was called Bobaloo.
7416920	7421920	Bob, who was the owner, he since passed away and his wife was Lou.
7421920	7424920	Bob was friends with my granddaddy.
7424920	7429920	They taught amateur skating, like figure skating with roller skates.
7429920	7434920	I would always go up there and just go hang out and talk about granddaddy.
7434920	7439920	They had the same Frogger machine there while I was growing up.
7439920	7441920	It was still always in good working condition.
7441920	7445920	The joystick was a little sticky, but it was the same Frogger machine.
7445920	7452920	I played that same machine for easily 10 years.
7452920	7456920	Anyway, how about more questions?
7456920	7460920	Oh, and Tiara wants to add Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the roller rink.
7460920	7468920	I remember when to play an arcade game it was either the arcade when they still existed or the pizza parlor.
7468920	7470920	Arcade games there.
7470920	7477920	I remember when Street Fighter II came out, everyone went to 7-Eleven to play it. When 7-Eleven actually had arcade cabinets.
7477920	7482920	Oh yeah, we did go to that. I don't know if it was 7-Eleven, but it was some sort of convenience store.
7482920	7485920	Or like Circle K. Everyone would go play Street Fighter II.
7485920	7488920	This is out in South Carolina, so I don't remember what it was called.
7488920	7492920	I remember my high school band trip though. When we went to New York, we drove up.
7492920	7495920	We actually stopped in Washington, D.C. and then went on up to New York.
7495920	7499920	And that was when Mortal Kombat II was in beta testing.
7499920	7502920	With all the glitches and the continuous things.
7502920	7504920	So we were just, MORTAL KOMBAT WAH!
7504920	7507920	And the guys would just play it instead of eat.
7507920	7511920	But I would play that too, because I loved Mortal Kombat and I was really good with Katana.
7511920	7518920	But that was, you know, that's probably one of my favorite high school video game memories I think.
7518920	7526920	Other than me letting out a very loud curse while I was playing Zelda Link to the Past while my mom was in the other room.
7526920	7529920	Oops.
7529920	7533920	Okay, so. Ooh, Redertainment asked a doozy.
7533920	7539920	Which place is more openly hostile to outsiders and those who don't conform to the, quote, norm?
7539920	7541920	Alabama or Utah?
7541920	7543920	I've never been to Utah.
7543920	7548920	People are fairly nice in Alabama unless you just say they're very, like,
7548920	7554920	People try, they tend to be nice unless they're just super backwards rednecks, I guess.
7554920	7559920	I don't know. I can't tell you about Utah, I've never been.
7559920	7561920	Anyone here been to Utah?
7561920	7563920	I've been through there, but I haven't really dealt with the people that much.
7563920	7566920	I was actually there for a day and a half, too.
7566920	7568920	Yeah.
7568920	7569920	Couldn't really tell.
7569920	7571920	I think everyone's got their bad places.
7571920	7574920	Yeah, it just depends on who you're running to.
7574920	7579920	Like, don't go, like, wearing a, uh,
7579920	7583920	I voted for Perot shirt in, you know, Alabama or something.
7583920	7589920	Or go, or I miss Bill Clinton, you know.
7589920	7591920	Last comes from Dark Tetsuya.
7591920	7594920	Can we resurrect Name That Tune now that we have time, that is?
7594920	7596920	Um, no.
7596920	7600920	Not until Rob gets back anyway, because then Rob can do all that for us.
7600920	7606920	See, we're a little lazy right now, and we're just sort of leaning back and, uh,
7606920	7608920	Ooh, chit-chat.
7608920	7611920	People send me more questions, dammit!
7611920	7613920	A comment from Chad-
7613920	7615920	See if we can figure out what a game is from a description.
7615920	7619920	It's a comment from, uh, Chad from Hook Hearted, um,
7619920	7623920	that his first game on the 2600 was Combat and Outlaw.
7623920	7625920	I definitely own those games.
7625920	7627920	I want to say that the-
7627920	7628920	They're in the vault.
7628920	7632920	I guess, like, the elite edition of the 2600 or whatever had combat in it.
7632920	7637920	And I think it was the sports game where you had to hit the select switch to cycle through the basketball and-
7637920	7638920	Yeah.
7638920	7639920	I remember that.
7639920	7641920	Okay, did you ever play The Odyssey 2?
7641920	7643920	No.
7643920	7646920	We actually have one. We do not have a TV that it will run on.
7646920	7648920	Because it's that old.
7648920	7650920	Does it have, like, Venture as one of the games on it?
7650920	7652920	I don't think it had Venture, but it had this-
7652920	7654920	That was a different one then.
7654920	7655920	Oh, that was Colecovision.
7655920	7658920	It had Casey's Crazy Chase and Casey Munchkin, the ones that-
7658920	7663920	Crazy Chase was the clone of Pac-Man, and they got sued and had to bury all these copies,
7663920	7666920	so if you have a copy of Casey Munchkin, it's kind of rare.
7666920	7668920	Which I think I've got two copies now.
7668920	7670920	I've never played it.
7670920	7674920	But when I was in second grade, I want to say- okay, when did Gremlins come out?
7674920	7677920	Because I saw Gremlins when I lived in that house.
7677920	7679920	I want to say 85 or 86.
7679920	7681920	Okay, so then I was-
7681920	7685920	If it was 85, I was 9 then.
7685920	7687920	Because, yeah, I would have been 9.
7687920	7691920	But, yeah, my next door neighbor had a Colecovision.
7691920	7699920	And we would play this racing game and Casey Crazy Chase and a game called Cryptequip,
7699920	7702920	where you put in a phrase and scramble them up and you had to guess what it is.
7702920	7705920	And I was really good at those word scrambles.
7705920	7713920	But there was another game where you could play as a warrior or a mage or some other person,
7713920	7717920	and then a changeling, which you could turn into invisible and go through.
7717920	7721920	And it was like this- you had to get from one side to the other and get the treasure.
7721920	7723920	And then it was this weird, bizarre game.
7723920	7725920	And I'm trying to remember the name of it.
7725920	7727920	So this is kind of why I was asking.
7727920	7732920	There's a lot of good games that I used to play and I just can't remember the names of them anymore.
7732920	7734920	It's been so long.
7734920	7738920	What was the first RPG that you really invested in and finished?
7738920	7742920	Like, you saw the ending and you had 30 hours logged or however long it took.
7742920	7746920	First RPG. Video game.
7746920	7750920	I would almost say Final Fantasy, except I really lost interest.
7750920	7754920	So I'm going to go with...
7754920	7757920	I know it was on the Nintendo and I'm trying to remember what it was.
7757920	7762920	It wasn't Star Tropics, it was...
7762920	7766920	And I can't really put Zelda in it too, because Zelda was more...
7766920	7771920	Yeah, let's eliminate Zelda from this.
7771920	7776920	Because that's more adventure.
7776920	7778920	Maybe it was Star Tropics.
7778920	7783920	It's been a long time. Is Star Tropics or Faxana due or something like that?
7783920	7791920	Mine was Dragon Warrior 1 and then Final Fantasy 1 shortly after that on the NES.
7791920	7794920	Mine was Fantasy Star.
7794920	7797920	Actually, for the most part, I was actually watching my friend play it.
7797920	7802920	He actually got a... I don't know if he called up Sega or something and they sent him a cheat sheet
7802920	7805920	to walk through the game so that we could figure out how to get through it.
7805920	7807920	That's pretty cool.
7807920	7810920	That's what was a really fun game.
7810920	7813920	What's kind of funny about that game is that when I played...
7813920	7821920	Because it scrolls with six frames between the dungeon phase.
7821920	7826920	When you play Shining in the Darkness on Genesis, it only does a three frame thing.
7826920	7828920	So it looks kind of...
7828920	7832920	Going between those two is kind of weird.
7832920	7834920	Sort of jerky animation versus sort of smooth.
7834920	7838920	Because it's like really just a kind of simple wall.
7838920	7845920	Other than like in Shining in the Darkness, it's like all knobbly and out of stone and stuff.
7845920	7847920	Well, we've got a question from MakeRipper.
7847920	7850920	What's the next Sims expansion going to be about?
7850920	7856920	I'm not counting lightning. Aren't they doing like a Cars one?
7856920	7858920	I don't remember.
7858920	7860920	For Sims 4?
7860920	7862920	Sims 3.
7862920	7864920	I think your mic cut out again.
7864920	7866920	Oh, how about that?
7866920	7868920	Yeah, I don't really exactly remember what it is.
7868920	7870920	I thought that they were doing like a vehicle related one.
7870920	7872920	I can find out I guess.
7872920	7874920	Yeah.
7874920	7878920	I never really got into The Sims.
7878920	7886920	I remember I tried Sims 1 a year or two after it was out and it had already become a worldwide phenomenon.
7886920	7888920	I fussed with it for a couple hours.
7888920	7890920	I never...
7890920	7892920	I never got it. I never figured it out.
7892920	7896920	The only thing on here is just late night.
7896920	7899920	Nothing really after that.
7899920	7901920	So, at least it's listed anyway.
7901920	7903920	But hey dude, nightclubs.
7903920	7907920	It would be so cool if you could have gay dancing in The Sims.
7907920	7909920	That would be fun.
7909920	7913920	And I wonder what they're going to call beer and...
7913920	7915920	They call wine nectar.
7915920	7916920	Ah.
7916920	7918920	It should just be wine.
7918920	7921920	And they should have beer and they need to have hard booze.
7921920	7925920	You should build a moonshine still in your bathroom.
7925920	7928920	Like in Dukes of Hazzard.
7928920	7934920	Well, Sims 2 has so much fan made content from like the 14 whatever expansion packs that came out.
7934920	7936920	I'm sure you can do that stuff in Sims 2.
7936920	7939920	Oh, Sims 3 has a lot of that stuff too.
7939920	7944920	And, you know, people making game mods and everything and EA knows.
7944920	7945920	Yeah.
7945920	7948920	They're like, okay, well you get to reinstall all of your stuff again.
7948920	7950920	Um, wow, okay.
7950920	7955920	Redertainment also asks, I'm thinking of building a general media library in my house once I buy one.
7955920	7958920	How large is the room your vault is in?
7958920	7960920	It's a small bedroom.
7960920	7965920	It's like 7x7 or something in there.
7965920	7967920	Something like that, yeah.
7967920	7974920	It's big enough for a bed and a dresser and, you know, bedside table.
7974920	7976920	I'd probably put like a...
7976920	7979920	I think a queen size bed would fit in there, but...
7979920	7982920	We used to have the futon in there and it took up most of the room.
7982920	7983920	Yeah.
7983920	7984920	Yeah.
7984920	7987920	So, yeah, not a whole lot of...
7987920	7988920	But there's lots of shelves.
7988920	7990920	Things are up to the ceiling.
7990920	7997920	We put in a really big two shelf unit that our friend gave us that has a lot of space on it.
7997920	8005920	And then we have utility shelves in the closet and a number of just bookshelves up on the walls too.
8005920	8015920	So, yeah, we've maximized our space saving options and I totally recommend investing in bins with lids that you can see through.
8015920	8020920	Hey, no one's sending us any more questions.
8020920	8024920	Is that a Rob?
8024920	8026920	That's a Rob.
8026920	8028920	Of course, the first thing he says when he comes in is,
8028920	8031920	bastard, which is just like Rob.
8031920	8033920	Welcome back, Rob.
8033920	8038920	I'm coming to cook because I don't want Rob to burn my house down.
8038920	8041920	He never cooks, ever.
8041920	8043920	He made toast once.
8043920	8051920	I went to, when he and Loki had the place, I went and made lobster kabobs for Rob.
8051920	8052920	Good times.
8052920	8053920	They were.
8053920	8055920	Okay, I'm going to go cook.
8055920	8056920	Okay.
8056920	8057920	Are we playing chair roulette?
8057920	8058920	Where am I sitting?
8058920	8059920	You should go sit in Jeremy's chair.
8059920	8060920	Yeah.
8060920	8062920	Hi, I'm back everybody.
8062920	8063920	I had a good trip.
8063920	8064920	Did I miss any good questions?
8064920	8066920	What were questions that were asked?
8066920	8071920	Let's see, like, what was the first game you played?
8071920	8074920	I just saw they timed me.
8074920	8077920	Goldanthro says, it took Rob about 19 minutes and 43 seconds.
8077920	8078920	There it is.
8078920	8079920	You know what's funny?
8079920	8080920	I couldn't find the place either.
8080920	8085920	I had to drive because I knew it was at such and such street in I-80.
8085920	8088920	And I was like, okay, well, there's a lot of shops around there.
8088920	8090920	So I was kind of like looking around.
8090920	8092920	I'm like, do I go, I know of this.
8092920	8095920	And yeah, I had to drive around a little bit.
8095920	8101920	I would have gotten back in like 14 minutes if I hadn't, you know, gotten lost.
8101920	8102920	That's all right.
8102920	8103920	Okay.
8103920	8104920	Sorry.
8104920	8105920	The game.
8105920	8106920	Yes.
8106920	8107920	The questions I missed.
8107920	8108920	Good stuff.
8108920	8109920	Any good ones?
8109920	8110920	Yeah.
8110920	8111920	First game played.
8111920	8116920	And then I think I asked them what the first real RPG that you played from start to finish
8116920	8117920	was.
8117920	8118920	The first game played?
8118920	8119920	Yeah.
8119920	8122920	Like, I think ours was like Pac-Man, Combat Outlaw.
8122920	8124920	Oh, like the first game I remember playing.
8124920	8131920	I have memories of playing Spider-Man on the 2600.
8131920	8134920	But I don't think that was the very first game I ever played.
8134920	8136920	Probably Pac-Man on the 2600.
8136920	8139920	That really awful like, bong, bong, bong.
8139920	8142920	Like the old school like noises in it.
8142920	8146920	When you get a ghost, I can't get my voice to go that high.
8146920	8150920	Yeah, it was pretty bad.
8150920	8152920	Have you read the drama about why that happened?
8152920	8157920	I mean, when you read about the whole drama behind it, it actually makes a lot of sense
8157920	8158920	why that game turned out the way it is.
8158920	8162920	Like, they would not let him produce it on the cartridge he needed.
8162920	8164920	And that's why Ms. Pac-Man was so much better.
8164920	8169920	Yeah, everything about the, you know, the epic video game industry bust of 84 and all
8169920	8173920	of the shovelware they were putting out, you know, Pac-Man was related to that.
8173920	8175920	Because Pac-Man was a national phenomenon.
8175920	8177920	And then they finally got the home version.
8177920	8180920	It was the ugliest thing that people had ever seen.
8180920	8181920	It was ugly as fuck.
8181920	8182920	It really was.
8182920	8183920	Yeah.
8183920	8187920	But they, well they made the poor guy condense it down to like a 4K cart, even though he
8187920	8188920	begged to have an 8K.
8188920	8191920	And that's why like the ghosts flicker.
8191920	8194920	Because the frickin' thing can't draw the ghosts fast enough.
8194920	8198920	It has to actually cycle through and it draws each one in sequence.
8198920	8199920	And that's why they flicker so much.
8199920	8201920	Did that game even have fruit in it that you ate?
8201920	8202920	I mean, obviously it would just be like-
8202920	8204920	It had the wafer in the middle.
8204920	8205920	Oh yeah, it was like a hash.
8205920	8206920	Like a pound sign.
8206920	8208920	Yeah, it was like a wafer that you would eat.
8208920	8209920	So, that was it.
8209920	8210920	And they called it the wafer.
8210920	8212920	And then Ms. Pac-Man was-
8212920	8213920	Was much better.
8213920	8215920	Was very competent for what the system was.
8215920	8216920	Yeah, but it was also on an 8K ROM.
8216920	8217920	Yeah.
8217920	8218920	And they had the room to do it.
8218920	8221920	And that's kind of like what the poor guy wanted to do the first time.
8221920	8223920	But, you know, it's all this stuff.
8223920	8227920	And then you kind of read about what happened with E.T. and some of these other old games too.
8227920	8229920	And it's really interesting because, what's the guy's name?
8229920	8231920	I think it's Howard Scott Warshaw is his name?
8231920	8233920	The dude who made Yars' Revenge.
8233920	8237920	Which is easily like one of the greatest 2600 games they ever made.
8237920	8240920	It's completely simple, but a lot of 2600 games were.
8240920	8242920	It was a lot of fun.
8242920	8245920	That guy was brought on to make the E.T. game.
8245920	8247920	But he had to rush it so fast.
8247920	8250920	And get it out by all these aggressive deadlines and so forth.
8250920	8253920	That, you know, it just ended up being kind of, you know, junky.
8253920	8255920	And I don't think it was tested properly.
8255920	8260920	And he still defends that it was not as terrible of a game as everybody says it is.
8260920	8261920	And I don't think it was.
8261920	8262920	Yeah.
8262920	8266920	It just had a couple key design problems with it that really prevented it from being-
8266920	8268920	Yeah, it was hard to understand.
8268920	8270920	But it was playable.
8270920	8274920	It was probably hard for some people to figure out what you had to do.
8274920	8277920	It took me a while to figure out what you had to do to finish it.
8277920	8279920	It really does. It's not an easy game to figure out.
8279920	8281920	Yeah, it wasn't intuitive at all.
8281920	8284920	But I remember beating it and getting him onto the ship.
8284920	8287920	And then I think every time you do it, doesn't it get harder and harder?
8287920	8288920	I can't remember.
8288920	8289920	Yeah.
8289920	8290920	It probably does.
8290920	8292920	But when you're seven it's hard to have really discerning taste.
8292920	8294920	That's usually the way the Atari 2600 games work.
8294920	8296920	It's just the same thing over but it gets harder.
8296920	8297920	Yeah.
8297920	8299920	Okay, then the other one was about RPGs.
8299920	8302920	What were these? Something? No, you asked a question about RPGs.
8302920	8305920	That was the question that I added was not including Zelda.
8305920	8306920	Okay.
8306920	8309920	Because I think everyone- RH has played Zelda and that's more adventure.
8309920	8312920	But just RPG, Earthbound, Star Tropics, whatever.
8312920	8315920	What was the first one you invested in and finished where you saw the ending?
8315920	8317920	That I actually finished or that I played-
8317920	8319920	That you finished.
8319920	8321920	Adventure on the 2600.
8321920	8322920	Okay.
8322920	8324920	Okay.
8324920	8326920	I don't know if that's really a-
8326920	8329920	My friend and I stayed up all night trying to beat that shit.
8329920	8330920	Maybe that doesn't count.
8330920	8332920	Let's go one generation up then.
8332920	8333920	Okay.
8333920	8334920	For the NES.
8334920	8335920	I can't say Sword Quest either.
8335920	8336920	We didn't finish Sword Quest. It was too fucking hard.
8336920	8337920	Yeah.
8337920	8339920	On the NES.
8339920	8343920	I never beat Final Fantasy. Does it have liquor in it?
8343920	8344920	Yes.
8344920	8345920	I'll try it.
8345920	8346920	It's brandy and apple juice.
8346920	8347920	They can't hear you.
8347920	8348920	No.
8348920	8351920	It's brandy and apple juice.
8351920	8353920	It's the apple pie.
8353920	8355920	That is pretty fucking good.
8355920	8356920	Do you want me to do it?
8356920	8358920	Oh, I thought this was for me.
8358920	8359920	Oh, poor Jamie.
8359920	8360920	Come on, Jamie.
8360920	8361920	You may-
8361920	8362920	I've got to have a last-
8362920	8364920	The look on her face.
8364920	8365920	I'm sorry.
8365920	8367920	The look on her face was of such defeat.
8367920	8372920	Like this cross between, oh you bitch, and oh you bitch.
8372920	8376920	Would you like the apple or the more tequila?
8376920	8378920	I'll try what that is, the apple pie.
8378920	8379920	You want to try a sip of this?
8379920	8380920	See if you like it?
8380920	8382920	I'll like it, I'm sure.
8382920	8383920	Okay.
8383920	8385920	That's good.
8385920	8387920	What question were we on?
8387920	8388920	I'm sorry.
8388920	8389920	Oh, Rama.
8389920	8390920	I'm sorry.
8390920	8391920	He just like just won my heart in there.
8391920	8395920	Not like actually, but it's the first NES game I played was The Goonies 2.
8395920	8400920	That game was so underrated for its time because it was so hard.
8400920	8402920	Like it was so complicated, but that game is amazing.
8402920	8409920	I beat that game with the help of the Nintendo tip line.
8409920	8412920	Where it was like what, five bucks a call in what, 86, 87?
8412920	8416920	And I had to basically cry to my grandmother, please let me call.
8416920	8419920	You called that number like four times this month, all for the same game.
8419920	8423920	And I was like, please, you don't have to give me a Christmas present.
8423920	8429920	If you let me call the NES line, because that was the shit back then.
8429920	8430920	I never call it.
8430920	8434920	My mom was like, no, no, no, go to your room.
8434920	8435920	No.
8435920	8437920	Like she wouldn't budge at all.
8437920	8441920	Like I could be like, you know, I have an uncurable disease and the only people that
8441920	8443920	could cure it in Nintendo life.
8443920	8445920	I have to enter the Konami code to cure cancer.
8445920	8446920	I don't know what it is.
8446920	8448920	She's like, do they charge?
8448920	8449920	Yes.
8449920	8450920	Go to your room.
8450920	8452920	I probably could have made it a bit more.
8452920	8455920	So that would be her response essentially.
8455920	8456920	Sorry.
8456920	8458920	Uh, Alan's trying the-
8458920	8459920	We're getting boozed up right now.
8459920	8460920	It's really awesome.
8460920	8462920	Which isn't smart because I have to drive home in four hours.
8462920	8464920	I mean, I could sleep here, but-
8464920	8465920	Well, and who knows?
8465920	8466920	We might go long.
8466920	8467920	We might.
8467920	8468920	We'll see.
8468920	8469920	We'll see.
8469920	8472920	But, um, I was actually sort of thinking that maybe it could have used another shot of brandy.
8472920	8473920	I'm sorry.
8473920	8475920	I don't want to get too screwed up.
8475920	8477920	Well, Alan gets more and you don't.
8477920	8479920	All right.
8479920	8480920	Where were we?
8480920	8482920	Goonies 2, Nintendo tip line.
8482920	8484920	It was the shit, et cetera.
8484920	8485920	Then what?
8485920	8488920	What was the first game you played in roller skates?
8488920	8489920	The first game I played-
8489920	8491920	Oh, I never answered the RPG one.
8491920	8498920	Uh, the RPG, um, that's not Zelda.
8498920	8500920	I never beat Final Fantasy.
8500920	8507920	We got to Tiamat, the dragon guy who's like the last of the elementals, but I never-
8507920	8512920	I never, um, beat him.
8512920	8516920	I played through Dragon Warrior and I beat Dragon Warrior.
8516920	8519920	That was my first for that generation.
8519920	8522920	Yeah, cause there weren't a lot of RPGs at that time.
8522920	8523920	I didn't beat Ultima 3.
8523920	8528920	That's the first one I remember playing and that was a old school RPG.
8528920	8530920	That and Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar.
8530920	8532920	I played the shit out of both of those games.
8532920	8536920	Um, and they're both really great and underrated again for the NES era.
8536920	8540920	Just cause they were PC translations and not everything from the PC translated well.
8540920	8542920	Uh, I guess it has to be Dragon Warrior.
8542920	8546920	I can't think of- what other RPGs were on the NES in that era?
8546920	8551920	Cause it feels like RPGs didn't really take off until the Super Nintendo.
8551920	8555920	I'm trying to remember other ones.
8555920	8557920	Yeah, I don't want to cause too much dead air.
8557920	8559920	What were some of your guys' answers? Dragon Warrior?
8559920	8563920	Mine were Dragon Warrior and then a few months later Final Fantasy 1.
8563920	8565920	Beat those.
8565920	8568920	And then I- there was a lot of stuff on the NES that I missed out on.
8568920	8569920	I never did Earthbound.
8569920	8571920	I never did StarTropics.
8571920	8573920	Earthbound wasn't really out on the NES.
8573920	8574920	A prototype was.
8574920	8576920	Earthbound came out on the Super NES later.
8576920	8577920	Okay.
8577920	8578920	It was- okay.
8578920	8579920	Story of Earthbound.
8579920	8583920	Earthbound was actually Mother 2 in Japan.
8583920	8587920	Mother 1 was on the NES.
8587920	8589920	But, um, yeah.
8589920	8591920	Mother 2 was on the Super Nintendo.
8591920	8594920	Then Mother 3 didn't come out until like just recently, right?
8594920	8595920	So, alright.
8595920	8597920	Do we need to play Chair Roulette again?
8597920	8598920	I'm sorry.
8598920	8599920	No?
8599920	8600920	Oh, you're baking.
8600920	8601920	You're baking.
8601920	8602920	That's right, Dark Soccer.
8602920	8603920	Oh, I'm gonna get baked.
8603920	8604920	Stop.
8604920	8605920	No, um.
8605920	8608920	Yeah, I figured I may as well stay up because it's got five more minutes left on it and
8608920	8609920	I'll just harass Dan.
8609920	8610920	Good times.
8610920	8611920	What pizza did you make first?
8611920	8612920	Uh, the pepperoni.
8612920	8613920	Dang.
8613920	8614920	Bless your heart.
8614920	8616920	Because I figured most of y'all are gonna eat the pepperoni.
8616920	8618920	I can cook my chicken one next, so.
8618920	8619920	Alright.
8619920	8620920	Good times.
8620920	8621920	And then the veggie.
8621920	8624920	I'll have a piece of the chicken one, I guess, if the pepperoni goes real fast.
8624920	8625920	Okay.
8625920	8628920	Uh, and then you started to ask, what was the first game I played in roller skates?
8628920	8631920	Uh, the local roller ring near us had Spy Hunter.
8631920	8632920	And it was a stand-up cabinet.
8632920	8634920	And it was the kind where you actually had the drive pedal.
8634920	8637920	Yes, I would use the roller skates on the drive pedal.
8637920	8640920	I would say it was probably that or Air Hockey.
8640920	8641920	Good old Roller King.
8641920	8643920	It's still there out in Roseville.
8643920	8644920	That's right by where I grew up.
8644920	8645920	I said his first was Gauntlet.
8645920	8647920	Dan says his first was Gauntlet.
8647920	8648920	When's Dan gonna be on the show?
8648920	8651920	Is Dan gonna come be on OLR?
8651920	8653920	The game that should not be named.
8653920	8654920	Alright.
8654920	8656920	Is that it for Ask Orange Launch?
8656920	8657920	Half of my drink.
8657920	8660920	Someone asked if we could play Name That Tune.
8660920	8661920	And then I think.
8661920	8662920	Oh yeah.
8662920	8663920	Danny was like.
8663920	8664920	Dark Tootsie's been begging me for that all week.
8664920	8666920	I didn't really set it up in advance.
8666920	8668920	I'm sorry.
8668920	8670920	And I don't even remember how the rules to that go.
8670920	8673920	I mean, I could see.
8673920	8674920	Yeah, we want to do match game and list list.
8674920	8675920	But I have to set those up too.
8675920	8678920	So we'll, we'll play with that later.
8678920	8681920	Well, how about, um, when I change out the pizzas?
8681920	8682920	Mm-hmm.
8682920	8686920	We can do the rest of the questions that are on our list for discussion topics.
8686920	8687920	Okay.
8687920	8695920	Actually, I'll tell you what, since really the rest of it was on there for you and Alan.
8695920	8699920	How about you guys go ahead and do your, your thing?
8699920	8700920	Oh yeah.
8700920	8701920	Let's get in there.
8701920	8702920	Well, there were a couple of news stories too.
8702920	8705920	Do we want to cover those?
8705920	8707920	There was one about, one about Telltale.
8707920	8708920	Did you want to?
8708920	8710920	Why don't we just do those after I'm done with pizza?
8710920	8711920	Later?
8711920	8712920	Okay, that's fine.
8712920	8713920	Not like we don't have All Night Rob.
8713920	8714920	Okay.
8714920	8717920	So Alan and I wanted to do our own classic games of the week and I want to let Bradley
8717920	8718920	do one of these too.
8718920	8719920	And I didn't know he was going to be here tonight.
8719920	8722920	So, um, Alan and I are doing our own classic games of the week.
8722920	8726920	We're taking over this segment because, um, you know, we wanted to have a longer show
8726920	8728920	tonight and, uh, we're kind of jealous.
8728920	8729920	The dark soccer always gets this segment.
8729920	8731920	I mean, don't you get jealous of her?
8731920	8734920	Alan, don't you want to be just like her?
8734920	8743920	So we have our own little classic game of the week segment.
8743920	8747920	Breakman's asking, when are they going to play truth or dare?
8747920	8750920	Um, you're gonna have to get me drunk in a minute.
8750920	8751920	All right.
8751920	8753920	Our own classic games of the week.
8753920	8755920	Alan, you want to start first?
8755920	8757920	What'd you pick as your classic game of the week?
8757920	8762920	I would love to have a, to take a minute to refamiliarize myself with the Wikipedia article
8762920	8763920	on it.
8763920	8764920	So can you go first?
8764920	8765920	Yes, I can.
8765920	8766920	I can.
8766920	8768920	Because you asked so kindly, I will go first and my classic game of the week.
8768920	8769920	Okay.
8769920	8771920	The music to this like sucks, but, um, deal.
8771920	8772920	Okay.
8772920	8776920	So I have picked a game that was on the PC a while ago, and it was, you're going to hear
8776920	8778920	this awesome, like ad lib noise in the background.
8778920	8781920	Cause it used like the ad lib card to make noise.
8781920	8784920	It was a game called Lexi Cross.
8784920	8787920	Um, Lexi Cross was like, there's like no music.
8787920	8789920	It just has the ambient noise to it.
8789920	8792920	Lexi Cross was like a futuristic game show that was on the PC.
8792920	8795920	Let me actually fast forward to some actual gameplay.
8795920	8799920	Um, you're just going to hear that vroom, vroom noise like a million times.
8799920	8801920	Cause that was most of the music in the game.
8801920	8805920	But basically what would happen is it was a two player futuristic game show.
8805920	8810920	And on each side of the board, you would have these, all these monitors or tiles that you
8810920	8813920	would have your little robot Vanna White that you moved around the screen and she could
8813920	8814920	reveal the tiles.
8814920	8818920	But if you hit a blank square, your turn would be over.
8818920	8823920	But if you hit a silver square that was, you know, part of the crossword puzzle, then you
8823920	8824920	could keep going.
8824920	8831920	So it was like this entire crossword puzzle was hidden underneath, um, this entire crossword
8831920	8834920	puzzle was hidden underneath, uh, the boards.
8834920	8836920	And there'd be all these special types of spaces.
8836920	8837920	There'd be plus money.
8837920	8838920	There'd be lose money.
8838920	8840920	There'd be vowel spaces.
8840920	8847920	There'd be, uh, look at a, uh, look at an entire row or an entire column really fast.
8847920	8849920	Like you'd get to peak for five seconds.
8849920	8851920	So you could kind of memorize where the tiles were.
8851920	8856920	Um, and at the end of the day, you would, you could spin the wheel was another option.
8856920	8859920	When you feel you've revealed enough tiles on the board, you could spin the wheel for
8859920	8860920	money.
8860920	8861920	And it kind of worked like wheel of fortune.
8861920	8866920	And once you revealed all the letters on the board, they would all kind of add up to what
8866920	8867920	the answer was.
8867920	8872920	Like all the words in the crossword had something to do with the, like if I fast forward way
8872920	8876920	ahead in this video here, where they actually start spinning for letters that they ever
8876920	8877920	do.
8877920	8882420	I think this guy probably runs out of time at some point, but he's spinning the wheel
8882420	8883680	here.
8883680	8888960	At some point, so many letters will be revealed that, um, they'll all have something in common.
8888960	8896440	Like maybe they're all, you know, places, uh, in Hawaii, or they're all quotes, you
8896440	8898560	know, from Shakespeare or something characters.
8898560	8900800	So that's kind of what you have to figure out there.
8900800	8906560	So it's a cool little, uh, old school game show and is, um, I don't know if you can even
8906560	8909360	download that, like on good old games or anything like that.
8909360	8915280	Like I doubt it's available anywhere like that, but, um, it's still out there on probably
8915280	8917080	abandonware sites and good stuff like that.
8917080	8920480	But there was copy protection in the manual that actually came with a little TV guide
8920480	8922720	parody that actually was the copy protection.
8922720	8926000	You had to know like what was on page seven, you remember old school, poppy protection
8926000	8927000	on PC games.
8927000	8928000	Like, yeah.
8928000	8929000	Yeah.
8929000	8931540	I remember playing leisure suit Larry at my friend's house and Ross having to, and also
8931540	8936640	King's quest, having to dig through the, um, manual to find the right word.
8936640	8937640	Oh yeah.
8937640	8938640	You know what it was?
8938640	8941660	The copy protection was like, what is on channel such and such at seven o'clock.
8941660	8945240	Cause that's like what was in the TV guide was, you know, it was like a programming list.
8945240	8948680	Uh, I'm reading in the Wikipedia article on this.
8948680	8950080	It came out in 1991.
8950080	8952000	It was by inner play.
8952000	8956640	Inner play made some other awesome, uh, old school PC games in the early nineties and
8956640	8957640	stuff.
8957640	8958640	I think they finally shut down in 2000.
8958640	8959640	What did they make?
8959640	8963200	Um, did they make MDK?
8963200	8964200	They made that.
8964200	8966840	They made, um, Bard's tail.
8966840	8969920	They're the guys that made Bard's tail good times.
8969920	8971780	Descent was also them.
8971780	8975720	So they had a lot of good stuff and they say it's a combination of wheel of fortune, scrabble
8975720	8976720	and battleship.
8976720	8979980	And that's a pretty good, pretty good combination.
8979980	8983680	The words eventually comprise a theme or a quotation, which the player must guess to
8983680	8984680	win the game.
8984680	8985960	So that's it a game show.
8985960	8986960	Go figure.
8986960	8987960	I picked a game show.
8987960	8990920	It's called the classic game of the week, but Lexi cross definitely an under looked
8990920	8991920	classic.
8991920	8994760	All right, Alan, you already, I am all right.
8994760	8995760	Oh, clay fighter.
8995760	8997280	Dark Tetsuya reminds us in chat.
8997280	8998280	Interplay did make clay fighter.
8998280	9000200	Let's play the music one more time.
9000200	9001200	I like this so much.
9001200	9002840	I want to do the classic game all over again.
9002840	9004760	Alan, what is your classic game of the week?
9004760	9010600	Well, for those of us who grew up playing Sierra online games, whether it be space quest,
9010600	9016120	King's quest or police quest, uh, often, uh, came across one of their lesser talked about
9016120	9020240	series, the quest for glory franchise.
9020240	9027440	And my pick is quest for glory to trial by fire came out in November of 1990.
9027440	9030480	Oh, this guy's talking through his thing here.
9030480	9031480	Sorry.
9031480	9034280	I gotta try to find some gameplay of this.
9034280	9037640	I don't know if there's anything where the guy's not talking.
9037640	9040480	You found the one earlier that had the, he was talking.
9040480	9044120	We didn't listen to the, let me see.
9044120	9045120	Okay.
9045120	9048120	Let's, uh, look at the introduction.
9048120	9049120	See, we didn't hear this earlier.
9049120	9050120	Did we?
9050120	9051120	I don't think so.
9051120	9054800	I don't want to hear this jerk talk over the game.
9054800	9060200	So quest for glory one had a traditional medieval English theme to it.
9060200	9065640	And at the end of the game, after the closing credits, a, your friend comes by on a flying
9065640	9070480	carpet and it's sort of a cliffhanger ending and he swoops the hero up on his flying carpet
9070480	9072560	and they fly away.
9072560	9078960	And when they land in quest for glory two, they are in Shapir, which is sort of a Persian,
9078960	9082280	you know, thousand and one Arabian nights styled game.
9082280	9085680	It is, um, out of King's quest and space quest.
9085680	9088480	It's more traditionally in RPG.
9088480	9094800	Um, those games are mostly about their puzzle solving and, um, the narrative, but quest
9094800	9097120	for glory actually had classes.
9097120	9099880	You could be a thief, mage, or warrior.
9099880	9101440	I did play this game.
9101440	9102440	Oh my God.
9102440	9103440	It was good.
9103440	9104440	Oh my God.
9104440	9105440	This game was awesome.
9105440	9108000	Depending on trigger until you said that I was like, I remember.
9108000	9109000	Yeah.
9109000	9110000	You could be the different classes.
9110000	9114840	And, uh, you could import your save file from part one so you could keep the same character
9114840	9118760	name and stats that you had at the end of the first one, which was a big deal at the
9118760	9119760	time.
9119760	9125320	Um, there's a puzzle towards the end of the game where you had to knock over these candles
9125320	9130120	because if the candles got lit, this evil ritual would complete.
9130120	9133760	So if you were a mage, you'd cast a magic missile or if you were a thief, you would
9133760	9136040	throw your knives.
9136040	9139840	So whatever class you were sort of affected how you solve the puzzles.
9139840	9146400	Um, it's about an evil vizier who wanted to raise a genie, the genie Iblis.
9146400	9154120	Um, and the game took place over the course of 30 days in game time.
9154120	9158880	So if you couldn't figure out how to, how to solve a puzzle for a certain day and your
9158880	9163800	character was tired, you would go to the end and type sleep and go to sleep and you'd wake
9163800	9167000	up and then you had to go out on a fresh clog.
9167000	9171960	It'd be 7 AM and you'd go out and you'd try to solve the puzzles again.
9171960	9176360	And you had to, you had to wrap up the game within 30 days of game time.
9176360	9181320	And the big deal about this game is that if you were super polite and you did all of the
9181320	9186880	optional side quests at the end, once you beat the game, you would discover that you
9186880	9190760	would unlock the Paladin career path.
9190760	9194840	And when you saved your game file and loaded it into Quest for Glory 3, you would be a
9194840	9200560	Paladin and that you could unlock that depending on, um, it didn't matter if you were a thief
9200560	9203680	or really important interruption, you'll eat veggie, right?
9203680	9204680	Yes.
9204680	9205680	Okay.
9205680	9208720	They're all getting their pizza while I talk about this game.
9208720	9219080	Um, so yeah, it, Quest for Glory came along pretty late in the EGA text based adventure
9219080	9221880	game era of Sierra.
9221880	9226480	Only the first two had EGA graphics and were completely text driven.
9226480	9234080	Well, I mean, as far as entering the commands Quest for Glory 3, which had a more African
9234080	9240600	slash Mayan, um, setting to it was had by then adapted to VGA graphics and the mouse
9240600	9247200	cursor where you click on look or touch, and then that's how you interacted with the puzzles.
9247200	9253640	So yeah, I played this game all through eighth grade and, uh, freshman year of high school
9253640	9256160	and it is super awesome.
9256160	9261240	And it's one of the few franchises that, um, people often overlook when talking about the
9261240	9264480	glory of, um, Sierra Onlines.
9264480	9269280	That's true because most people remember Leisure Zuleri and King's Quest, especially the fourth
9269280	9270280	one.
9270280	9271280	Yeah.
9271280	9272280	But usually this one gets overlooked that and Space Quest.
9272280	9273280	Yeah.
9273280	9277880	So yeah, the fact that you could, um, start with Quest for Glory one and use the same
9277880	9283040	save file, the same character sheet all through Quest for Glory five, which I owned, but I
9283040	9289200	never played because it was very, it Quest for Glory five came out and I think the mid
9289200	9293400	nineties, late nineties when adventure games were dead, no one cared, no one was doing
9293400	9294480	them anymore.
9294480	9299800	So it was very buggy and broken and I never really finished it, but this one out of the
9299800	9302920	out of the original classics, part two is definitely the best.
9302920	9304320	All right.
9304320	9307520	What was it about two that made you love it the most?
9307520	9314040	Just the music, the atmosphere, um, it basically took everything that was in one and just made
9314040	9316720	it better like a sequel should.
9316720	9320520	Derek H and Chad asked a good question, what happened to Roberta Williams?
9320520	9324400	Didn't she kind of, I don't know, she wasn't happy with the way the gaming culture was
9324400	9325400	going, right?
9325400	9328120	Like she wasn't a fan of consoles, if I'm not mistaken.
9328120	9333200	The last thing that she really consulted on, I want to say was Quest for Glory, was Quest
9333200	9339600	for Glory eight, which had this guy in it that wasn't from, from the, um, King Graham
9339600	9341080	and Daventry and all of that.
9341080	9346840	It was very ugly, clunky, 3d adventure game with like real time combat.
9346840	9347840	It was awful.
9347840	9350280	That King's Quest, Mask of Eternity.
9350280	9353040	That was the last thing that she sort of consulted on.
9353040	9361080	But um, after that, I think Sierra went bankrupt because adventure gaming was over and real
9361080	9363320	quick, I'm looking at a Wikipedia article on her.
9363320	9364320	She also made Phantasmagoria.
9364320	9369000	Remember, it was also courting into her run across seven discs.
9369000	9370000	Yeah.
9370000	9371000	Epic.
9371000	9374440	She was hired in 1998 and she's kind of stayed away from the public eye.
9374440	9377440	She really doesn't want to give interviews ever to talk about it, but she did talk about
9377440	9383660	it in 2006 and she said that the, her favorite game that she ever created was Phantasmagoria,
9383660	9384720	not King's Quest.
9384720	9388600	She said, quote, if I could pick only one game, I would pick Phantasmagoria as I've
9388600	9393000	always enjoyed working on it immensely and it was so very challenging and I love to be
9393000	9394000	challenged.
9394000	9396960	However, in my heart, I will always love the King's Quest series and especially King's
9396960	9402560	Quest ones, it was the game that really made Sierra online.
9402560	9406840	I have to say before I go out and check on the pizza again, Phantasmagoria was amazing.
9406840	9407840	The end.
9407840	9408840	It was.
9408840	9409840	It was awesome.
9409840	9412200	So many epic like FMVs and stuff.
9412200	9415940	Roberta Williams also went on to say that she said that her games are explicitly targeted
9415940	9421000	towards a more affluent and educated audience and it actually made people kind of criticize
9421000	9425320	her that she was kind of an elitist, but she did sum up her feelings in 99 with an interview
9425320	9429760	on Gamers Depot, quote, back when I got started, which sounds like ancient history, back then
9429760	9433160	the demographics of people who were into computer games was totally different in my opinion
9433160	9434440	than they are today.
9434440	9437920	Back then, computers were more expensive, which made them more exclusive to people who
9437920	9440640	were maybe at a certain income level or education level.
9440640	9443940	So the people who played computer games 15 years ago were that type of person.
9443940	9447440	They probably didn't watch television as much and the instant gratification era hadn't quite
9447440	9448880	grown the way it has lately.
9448880	9452320	I think in the last five or six years, the demographics have really changed.
9452320	9456280	Now this is my opinion because computers are less expensive so more people can afford them.
9456280	9458800	More average people now feel they should own one.
9458800	9468320	Yeah, well back in 1987, 88, 89, if you had a computer with EGA graphics, a 20 meg hard
9468320	9473800	drive with 512K RAM, that was like four or five grand.
9473800	9479920	Like you were loaded if you had a IBM desktop with color back then.
9479920	9480920	Oh yeah.
9480920	9481920	Oh yeah.
9481920	9482920	That would be really well off.
9482920	9488600	I want to say our first Packard Bell was like a 386SX16 or something and it was like a $2,000
9488600	9489600	computer.
9489600	9490600	Yeah.
9490600	9494040	It was very expensive.
9494040	9498360	By the way, also Roberta Williams said in a 2006 interview that designing computer games
9498360	9504600	is in the past for her now, but she does want to write a historical novel someday.
9504600	9506960	So there you go.
9506960	9507960	That's awesome.
9507960	9512280	She's actually on the cover of Soft Porn Adventure by Online Systems.
9512280	9513520	She's actually on the cover.
9513520	9515680	That is crazy.
9515680	9516920	How funny.
9516920	9525340	I almost chose Leisure Suit Larry 3 for my pick because aside from the whole EGA boobies,
9525340	9529720	it's an incredibly difficult and fun adventure game.
9529720	9532240	Very cool.
9532240	9537440	Also her last game she's credited with is King's Quest Mask of Eternity in 98, which
9537440	9540960	I'm assuming is King's Quest VIII, which was the last official King's Quest game.
9540960	9541960	It was awful.
9541960	9542960	Yeah.
9542960	9547480	I wonder in what capacity she worked on that game because that was three years after Phantasmagoria
9547480	9557160	in 95 and she didn't do anything in Phantasmagoria 2.
9557160	9558160	There you go.
9558160	9559160	All right.
9559160	9565360	That was kind of a nice little derivative there to talk about that.
9565360	9567280	I think we'll go ahead and kind of take a quick break.
9567280	9570080	You'll give us a chance to eat here and get the other pizza done.
9570080	9573240	We're going to just play a little bit of music, save this part of the show we have done so
9573240	9574240	far.
9574240	9575240	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
9575240	9576440	When we come back, we'll do more of your questions.
9576440	9580040	We'll do more calls too and a couple more stories for you guys as well when we come
9580040	9584800	back with the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon live here at All Games Radio.
9584800	9599480	We'll be right back.
