WEBVTT

00:14.200 --> 00:26.427
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight, September 19th, 2010, a much-hyped MMO shuts down after only three months, Konami and Harmonix settle their Rock Band lawsuit, and the Nielsen Report rates the effectiveness of ads in video games.

00:31.775 --> 00:36.516
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.596 --> 00:39.657
[SPEAKER_10]: We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.117 --> 00:48.299
[SPEAKER_10]: We meet live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Except tonight, actually we didn't meet after the Bobby Blackwolf show because he's on vacation.

00:52.641 --> 00:53.161
[SPEAKER_10]: How dare he?

00:53.581 --> 00:56.082
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours.

00:56.782 --> 01:00.923
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to my awesome co-hosts, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.168
[SPEAKER_10]: Buh.

01:02.509 --> 01:03.269
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, my friend?

01:03.589 --> 01:04.190
[SPEAKER_05]: Buh.

01:05.250 --> 01:05.871
[SPEAKER_10]: That good, huh?

01:05.991 --> 01:07.412
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing fantastic, Rob.

01:07.532 --> 01:08.692
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to hear it.

01:08.752 --> 01:09.673
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are you today?

01:10.133 --> 01:10.533
[SPEAKER_10]: Super.

01:10.593 --> 01:11.494
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for asking.

01:11.714 --> 01:12.074
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

01:13.135 --> 01:13.415
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:13.535 --> 01:17.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Also joining us, as he does every week, say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.

01:17.497 --> 01:18.858
[SPEAKER_10]: That last fry didn't taste good.

01:19.279 --> 01:26.563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to hear that, but I heard you exclaim, literally as the opening credits are rolling on our show, I hear Loki go, ooh, bonus onion ring.

01:27.833 --> 01:28.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:50.041 --> 01:52.643
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty busy week in gaming thanks to the Tokyo Game Show.

01:52.683 --> 01:55.485
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of news and stuff going on here in the States as well.

01:55.545 --> 01:57.206
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like so much to talk about tonight.

01:58.146 --> 02:03.690
[SPEAKER_10]: We supposedly have some guests coming, but I got a text that they're running late, of course, because these people always run late.

02:04.030 --> 02:04.591
[SPEAKER_10]: Shh, don't tell them.

02:05.271 --> 02:08.953
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm assuming they'll be here any moment, so we'll introduce them whenever they show up.

02:09.454 --> 02:15.958
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably won't come into the studio quietly, so I apologize in advance for any derailment that is bound to happen on this lovely radio program.

02:17.153 --> 02:18.053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay, I dressed up.

02:18.433 --> 02:20.754
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk, yes you did, you went all out today.

02:21.114 --> 02:23.794
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, she's wearing her pajamas just so you guys know.

02:24.414 --> 02:28.995
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's start it off with how was your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week.

02:29.035 --> 02:34.436
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know DarkSakura finally jumped into something because I got a text message earlier this week that let me know she did.

02:34.536 --> 02:36.156
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's up DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

02:36.176 --> 02:42.737
[SPEAKER_05]: I started Final Fantasy XIII and I got to the part where they transformed into special people.

02:44.258 --> 02:45.958
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's as far as I am right now.

02:47.743 --> 03:00.012
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm playing The Sims 3 right now because Dan got me Ambitions And Dan's home from his trip and I'm so happy And that's it So Final Fantasy XIII, what do you think of the battle system?

03:00.072 --> 03:01.874
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of takes forever to get going, doesn't it?

03:02.514 --> 03:15.024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm like, the game that plays itself I'm just going to sit back and eat some rice and watch a movie Which is basically how I've been treating it It's like, oh, it's a movie that I can push a button every so often

03:16.104 --> 03:16.865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

03:34.684 --> 03:38.447
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a long day yesterday because it was Yom Kippur.

03:40.208 --> 03:46.693
[SPEAKER_05]: To sum it up in a nutshell, it's the Day of Atonement.

03:46.713 --> 03:49.636
[SPEAKER_05]: You apologize a lot and don't need anything.

03:49.656 --> 03:52.638
[SPEAKER_05]: That's putting a really simplistic view on it.

03:53.759 --> 03:56.121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very beautiful service.

03:56.481 --> 03:59.183
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy to have attended all day.

04:00.164 --> 04:02.186
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy to eat when the sun went down.

04:02.938 --> 04:06.522
[SPEAKER_10]: So, after 24 hours of fasting, Betty fucking Crocker sound pretty good, huh?

04:06.682 --> 04:09.464
[SPEAKER_05]: More like 20... 26 hours?

04:09.985 --> 04:09.464
25?

04:10.165 --> 04:11.206
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but who's counting?

04:11.246 --> 04:12.627
[SPEAKER_05]: Before sundown and then post sundown.

04:13.208 --> 04:13.368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

04:13.809 --> 04:15.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you end up counting.

04:15.851 --> 04:16.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh...

04:18.493 --> 04:19.254
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

04:38.290 --> 05:00.643
[SPEAKER_10]: and three poster designs tomorrow speaking of other podcasts the Robin Extifer Warcraft show is supposed to start this week but sadly we ran into some technical difficulties we can't seem to do Skype on my computer I can't do Skype I'm frustrated no I can't do Skype on my home computer like I can on the one here in the studio so we weren't able to do our little thing so I don't know what we're gonna do we'll figure it out we're smart people

05:01.914 --> 05:02.954
[SPEAKER_10]: Just in time for Cataclysm.

05:02.974 --> 05:03.955
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you smart fellers?

05:04.395 --> 05:04.595
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

05:04.655 --> 05:06.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you smart fellers or fart smellers?

05:06.776 --> 05:07.076
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

05:07.816 --> 05:10.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

05:10.677 --> 05:10.917
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.657
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week?

05:12.918 --> 05:13.598
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fine.

05:14.158 --> 05:17.900
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my iPod finally, so I downloaded a bunch of stuff on there.

05:19.561 --> 05:26.830
[SPEAKER_09]: and, uh, let's see, I'm, I tried a little bit of, uh, Plants vs. Zombies, because I have yet to jump into that, and it's pretty fun.

05:27.550 --> 05:30.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, hopefully gonna play a little bit more of that, other than, like, two minutes worth.

05:31.375 --> 05:34.279
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, uh, what else did I play?

05:34.299 --> 05:34.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

05:36.775 --> 05:40.156
[SPEAKER_09]: Played some of the Mirror's Edge game on the iPhone, which is kind of neat.

05:41.857 --> 05:45.599
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very simplistic, but it still has that kind of same look as the full game.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Fruit Ninja, because that's really easy and casual.

05:53.202 --> 05:57.383
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually kind of downloaded that because it's actually one of the ones that is supported by Game Center.

05:57.483 --> 06:00.084
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought it'd be neat to try out.

06:01.585 --> 06:09.287
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course I had to download Robot Unicorn Attack because, well, I don't think I need to explain myself there.

06:12.107 --> 06:16.268
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so surreal to me that you're coming in here and playing with your little iPod now.

06:16.548 --> 06:20.469
[SPEAKER_10]: This is after a good, I don't know, eight years of just Apple hatred.

06:20.529 --> 06:21.829
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I still hate Apple.

06:22.129 --> 06:23.250
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I still hate Apple.

06:23.270 --> 06:24.790
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're sitting there playing with your iPod.

06:24.990 --> 06:26.330
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, hey Rob, let me see what apps you have.

06:26.810 --> 06:27.791
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Jamie, let me see your phone.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.671
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really funny to me.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, it's very convenient for browsing the web.

06:33.863 --> 06:39.428
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, Nelly's mom came over and she's like, I need the 800 number for AAA.

06:40.049 --> 06:42.331
[SPEAKER_09]: And Nelly was like, okay, well, let me boot up my laptop.

06:42.411 --> 06:47.155
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, okay, hold on, let me real quickly just turn my iPod on, hit the web browser, done.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.136
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:05.576 --> 07:07.197
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so it's neat.

07:07.357 --> 07:13.179
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other thing that I got with that is I got a Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200, which is a 3G hotspot.

07:13.419 --> 07:17.281
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm actually using that right now to connect to the web.

07:17.721 --> 07:23.184
[SPEAKER_09]: It's literally, it is smaller than the iPod that I have right now, but it works pretty well.

07:23.784 --> 07:27.806
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like 40 bucks a month flat, so I'm kind of digging that a little bit.

07:29.646 --> 07:32.808
[SPEAKER_09]: Console games, of course, Playmore Grand Theft Auto, because that's just...

07:34.188 --> 07:34.669
[SPEAKER_09]: A given.

07:36.329 --> 07:39.651
[SPEAKER_09]: Really ain't playing too much else other than that because I just haven't had time.

07:40.371 --> 07:45.113
[SPEAKER_09]: Wife's keeping me busy with keeping the baby out of her hair.

07:46.513 --> 07:47.674
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking baby.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that gives me no time to do anything.

07:51.776 --> 08:00.459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really sad because I wanted to work on stuff this weekend and instead I had to go shop for groceries for two hours and run a bunch of errands.

08:00.519 --> 08:02.200
[SPEAKER_09]: I come back home and she's like...

08:02.640 --> 08:06.281
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been sitting here with the baby for all this time and he won't stop crying.

08:06.362 --> 08:07.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, you take him.

08:07.242 --> 08:09.583
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, oh yeah, I haven't been doing anything at all.

08:09.603 --> 08:12.204
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been, you know, playing around.

08:12.304 --> 08:13.764
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you get for making babies.

08:16.803 --> 08:22.485
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, that's basically all I've done this week is mainly download a ton of apps.

08:22.605 --> 08:25.566
[SPEAKER_09]: I've spent way too much money on apps, so that's for sure.

08:25.586 --> 08:27.046
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to cut back on that.

08:27.226 --> 08:30.687
[SPEAKER_10]: This little 3G router thingy-ma-bobber you have, what is this again?

08:30.727 --> 08:31.888
[SPEAKER_10]: A Virgin Mobile?

08:31.928 --> 08:33.268
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's called a MiFi 2200.

08:33.308 --> 08:34.969
[SPEAKER_09]: They have them through Virgin.

08:34.989 --> 08:38.770
[SPEAKER_09]: They have them through Sprint, AT&T, I think even.

08:39.510 --> 08:59.135
[SPEAKER_09]: and but the plan that's the cheapest is actually the virgin plan and it piggybacks on the Sprint Network and it's it's flat $40 and it's you know there's no plan so if you want to use it you pay 40 bucks and you get a full month worth of unlimited bandwidth unlimited data whatever

08:59.454 --> 09:00.075
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

09:17.054 --> 09:17.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

09:33.806 --> 09:37.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a program to send free text messages so I can do that.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.952
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a number that's associated with that now so people can text me if they want to.

09:43.534 --> 09:47.437
[SPEAKER_10]: You should give out that number here on the show and see what kind of text messages you get during the week.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi Loki, I'm in the potty!

09:52.060 --> 09:53.561
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be quite foolish.

09:56.904 --> 10:02.208
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I have that, and then, I don't know, I've just, I've been downloading a bunch of junk.

10:02.588 --> 10:10.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what, I sit there, you know, I have the baby in my arm, and I'm sitting there just kind of browsing the internet, and I'm like, okay, hmm, what apps could I possibly need?

10:12.575 --> 10:13.075
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I know.

10:13.115 --> 10:15.457
[SPEAKER_09]: They just talked about Police Scanner app on TV.

10:15.497 --> 10:16.497
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to download that.

10:16.517 --> 10:17.938
[SPEAKER_09]: He's an appaholic.

10:18.999 --> 10:19.719
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.401
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in two months, the novelty will wear off.

10:23.962 --> 10:30.886
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, it doesn't matter, though, because I didn't really pay any money for this, although I did spend a lot of money on apps, so Apple still wins in this.

10:31.186 --> 10:35.608
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com, they always make A-plus comments, such as this one.

10:36.108 --> 10:38.970
[SPEAKER_10]: Alf in chat says, Now Loki's butt will have cancer.

10:39.811 --> 10:41.512
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm assuming that's from the router.

10:41.532 --> 10:41.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

10:42.492 --> 10:48.854
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't always... Being in your butt or next to your butt or wherever it is in close proximity to your butt will somehow give you butt cancer.

10:48.874 --> 10:54.257
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can't really use it too much in my back pocket because if I sit down, it turns it off.

10:54.877 --> 10:56.277
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's not good.

10:58.238 --> 11:00.659
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, that's where I store it for now.

11:01.039 --> 11:05.203
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't store it in my butt, but in my pocket, yes.

11:05.424 --> 11:09.468
[SPEAKER_10]: But if somebody did store it in their butt, they'd be like 3G everywhere they go.

11:09.488 --> 11:12.531
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still cool though, because see, not only can I... You can name the network, Rob's butt.

11:12.571 --> 11:18.077
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only can I connect to that, but it can sort of port up the five devices at once.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd imagine it'd be very slow with five devices connected to it, but...

11:22.898 --> 11:24.699
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm connected to your butt right now.

11:25.039 --> 11:25.720
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.661
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's introduce the guests because they're dying to make a comment.

11:28.821 --> 11:32.103
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been forever, really, since these two have been on the show.

11:32.463 --> 11:33.524
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're quite the duo.

11:33.544 --> 11:37.726
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, I'm sure you've heard these guys on the show.

11:37.807 --> 11:38.987
[SPEAKER_10]: They're loved by the masses.

11:39.548 --> 11:39.908
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

11:39.928 --> 11:41.028
[SPEAKER_10]: I just say that to talk about.

11:41.429 --> 11:43.230
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to Rice Princess.

11:43.630 --> 11:44.070
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

11:46.031 --> 11:46.692
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, can we hear you?

11:46.852 --> 11:47.292
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that on?

11:48.726 --> 11:49.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Lalalala, Jerk

12:03.786 --> 12:04.146
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and hi.

12:04.426 --> 12:04.666
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

12:04.766 --> 12:08.148
[SPEAKER_10]: Also say hello to the one and only The Doctor is back.

12:08.228 --> 12:08.968
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm The Doctor.

12:09.168 --> 12:09.928
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what's up?

12:09.948 --> 12:10.308
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty good.

12:10.328 --> 12:10.629
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty good.

12:10.729 --> 12:16.051
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want you to say Rob's butt has been in network for years and years and years.

12:16.511 --> 12:18.171
[SPEAKER_18]: That's pretty much the only comment.

12:18.672 --> 12:19.472
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

12:19.712 --> 12:23.113
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm seeing the Sonic Screwdriver, which was also working Rob's butt.

12:23.713 --> 12:25.334
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to play with the Sonic Screwdriver.

12:25.394 --> 12:25.654
[SPEAKER_10]: Here you go.

12:25.694 --> 12:29.356
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not comfortable with how much of the discussion on this show is about my butt.

12:30.336 --> 12:31.096
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not okay with that.

12:31.116 --> 12:31.917
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your own fault.

12:32.177 --> 12:32.797
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

12:32.817 --> 12:33.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.501
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, what the hell have you been up to, Rice Princess?

12:38.081 --> 12:42.662
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't been on the show in like a year, it seems like, because I don't think you've been since we've been here at Studio Sakura.

12:43.102 --> 12:51.044
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't, and I'm kind of insulted that you didn't notice that the Doctor and I are wearing... You are wearing Masked in Castlevania shirts, because it's old school and new school.

12:51.064 --> 12:55.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, mine's better, but... Isn't today a special day in the relationship between you and the Doctor?

12:56.126 --> 12:58.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the first time we had sex.

12:59.607 --> 13:00.827
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's straight.

13:01.906 --> 13:02.286
[SPEAKER_10]: And me?

13:02.406 --> 13:02.727
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

13:03.047 --> 13:06.389
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was... No, September 9th, 2000.

13:06.929 --> 13:08.771
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

13:08.831 --> 13:09.731
[SPEAKER_10]: Was the night we all met.

13:09.971 --> 13:10.832
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

13:10.872 --> 13:13.574
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for some reason... No, it was Irene I met in November.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.196
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and then we all went back to your apartment and played Wheel of Fortune.

13:17.496 --> 13:17.917
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

13:17.937 --> 13:18.557
[SPEAKER_10]: In Roseville.

13:19.198 --> 13:19.878
[SPEAKER_18]: And butt sex.

13:19.918 --> 13:21.619
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob's Network was on that night.

13:23.460 --> 13:23.781
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.223
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've got a gift to regale you with.

13:27.263 --> 13:27.863
[SPEAKER_18]: You can open later.

13:27.883 --> 13:29.284
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't have to bring gifts.

13:29.304 --> 13:29.705
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's right.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.205
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll take it.

13:30.305 --> 13:30.745
[SPEAKER_10]: It's poop.

13:32.847 --> 13:33.267
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

13:33.927 --> 13:36.149
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're wearing matching Castle... Well, they're not matching Castlevania shirts.

13:36.209 --> 13:37.590
[SPEAKER_10]: It's old school Castlevania new school.

13:37.790 --> 13:40.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's Symphony of the Night, so mine's automatically cooler.

13:40.812 --> 13:41.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, his is old school.

13:41.632 --> 13:42.152
[SPEAKER_03]: But his is great.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like his too.

13:43.193 --> 13:45.975
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we have to push the start key now.

13:46.135 --> 13:46.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

13:46.355 --> 13:46.595
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

13:47.075 --> 13:48.076
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to ask where that is.

13:48.096 --> 13:49.977
[SPEAKER_06]: But where is the start key is the question.

13:50.057 --> 13:51.678
[SPEAKER_10]: Finding is the game, actually.

13:51.718 --> 13:53.399
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the other game.

13:53.639 --> 13:54.440
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a scary game.

13:54.600 --> 13:54.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

13:56.301 --> 13:58.982
[SPEAKER_10]: Since you guys haven't been on the show in a while, we actually have some new listeners.

13:59.042 --> 14:03.224
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe it or not, people actually subscribe to the show and stay subscribed.

14:03.484 --> 14:06.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same five people under different names?

14:06.485 --> 14:11.687
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we've got emails and people are like, hey, I just started listening and my first show was the fuck show.

14:11.727 --> 14:12.427
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, really?

14:12.467 --> 14:14.047
[SPEAKER_10]: And you didn't unsubscribe after that?

14:14.067 --> 14:15.468
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, that's amazing.

14:15.508 --> 14:16.388
[SPEAKER_10]: You're weird.

14:16.928 --> 14:21.070
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those that maybe haven't heard you on the show before, what kind of video games are you into?

14:21.090 --> 14:21.870
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you like to play?

14:21.970 --> 14:24.311
[SPEAKER_10]: What types of stuff have you been playing right now, Rice Princess?

14:24.891 --> 14:28.675
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play anything now except for WoW because I have a love-hate relationship with it.

14:29.175 --> 14:34.921
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like Super Nintendo games, Nintendo games, older stuff.

14:35.321 --> 14:35.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Retro stuff?

14:36.082 --> 14:38.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't really played much on the newer gen.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.807
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you say is a totally underrated retro game?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Clash at Demon Head.

14:43.669 --> 14:44.490
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you were going to say that.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you knew I was going to say that.

14:46.392 --> 14:47.613
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that game underrated?

14:47.633 --> 14:49.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's fucking awesome and no one's played it.

14:50.430 --> 14:55.153
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get a little hot when you saw that the band in the Scott Pilgrim movie was called Clash of Demon Head?

14:55.293 --> 14:58.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because I was probably the only person in the theater who's actually played that game.

14:59.916 --> 15:00.456
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

15:00.697 --> 15:01.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I liked it a lot.

15:02.057 --> 15:02.478
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

15:02.518 --> 15:03.118
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, Eddie?

15:03.138 --> 15:04.079
[SPEAKER_03]: How about The Doctor?

15:04.339 --> 15:06.120
[SPEAKER_10]: The Doctor, what types of games have you been playing lately?

15:06.640 --> 15:10.802
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, not much lately because like the Rice Princess, I own a Wii.

15:11.463 --> 15:15.064
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm a very angry Wii player because there's no games for it.

15:15.344 --> 15:18.566
[SPEAKER_18]: I looked at my Wii history for the past six months and it's just Netflix.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.267
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no games being played.

15:20.967 --> 15:26.190
[SPEAKER_18]: But before that, I had downloaded Cave Story on the virtual console, which is a really fun 8-bit style game.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.931
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, I like a lot of old school stuff.

15:27.991 --> 15:31.954
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the new stuff, I just don't like Halo and Call of Duty and stuff.

15:32.374 --> 15:35.576
[SPEAKER_18]: So I like adventure type games, and there's not a lot of that on the Wii.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.217
[SPEAKER_18]: It's mostly a soccer mom console now.

15:37.257 --> 15:38.658
[SPEAKER_18]: What about Metroid Other M?

15:38.698 --> 15:40.980
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the big... I've heard terrible reviews on that though.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.341
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to play it, but I've heard terrible reviews.

15:43.361 --> 15:44.442
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you guys think.

15:44.822 --> 15:51.366
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little worried, because it's supposed to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, and I've heard a lot of awful things about it, but I've heard some really good things about it, so I don't know.

15:51.427 --> 15:53.708
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard play-wise, it's fantastic.

15:53.848 --> 15:55.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Story-wise, it's balls.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.491
[SPEAKER_05]: and not the good kind of balls.

15:58.671 --> 15:59.632
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray D.N.

15:59.712 --> 16:03.614
[SPEAKER_10]: Silvergun in our chat room says, I get it, says you should get Sin and Punishment 2.

16:06.316 --> 16:06.856
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

16:07.837 --> 16:08.737
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Sin and Punishment 2?

16:09.057 --> 16:10.238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell that is.

16:10.338 --> 16:11.219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the Wii.

16:11.279 --> 16:12.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I still don't know what it is.

16:13.040 --> 16:13.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you, him.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fine.

16:14.460 --> 16:15.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you.

16:15.221 --> 16:15.541
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for him.

16:15.561 --> 16:15.881
[SPEAKER_10]: Shooter.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.084
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's another shooter, which, you know, I'd play that if I wanted to go to sleep, so.

16:20.684 --> 16:21.645
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, fine.

16:22.245 --> 16:28.189
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust the industry nowadays because remember how they said Shattered Memories was like the best game at E3?

16:28.890 --> 16:30.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking worst game ever made.

16:31.432 --> 16:33.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I just want to punch Silent Hill.

16:33.613 --> 16:35.074
[SPEAKER_03]: What was wrong with Silent Hill Shattered Memories?

16:35.295 --> 16:36.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.296
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a game.

16:37.436 --> 16:39.858
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, here, I'm going to poop on your face.

16:39.878 --> 16:41.639
[SPEAKER_10]: E3 game of the year.

16:41.659 --> 16:44.461
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember the poop on your face scene, actually.

16:44.541 --> 16:47.563
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it because that's all that happened over and over.

16:47.583 --> 16:47.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I...

16:48.524 --> 16:51.506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... Like, oh my gosh, oh, Alessa, it's you.

16:51.546 --> 16:52.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Boop on your face.

16:53.628 --> 16:55.729
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you son of a bitch, you got me again.

16:57.251 --> 17:00.293
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was going to be different this time, but no.

17:00.393 --> 17:01.794
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you and I play the same game?

17:01.834 --> 17:04.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just remember the snow and a lot of running.

17:04.116 --> 17:07.958
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember... Yeah, you didn't see the tracks of, like, shit everywhere?

17:07.978 --> 17:08.979
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

17:09.179 --> 17:10.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I got, like, the director's cut or something.

17:12.682 --> 17:16.024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I got the shit on your face version.

17:16.645 --> 17:18.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll stop cussing now.

17:18.326 --> 17:18.626
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

17:18.806 --> 17:19.326
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's all right.

17:19.727 --> 17:20.387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a family show.

17:21.988 --> 17:22.468
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

17:23.528 --> 17:24.209
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week.

17:24.229 --> 17:24.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Exposure.

17:24.769 --> 17:25.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Exposure.

17:25.809 --> 17:26.570
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.670
[SPEAKER_10]: What types of stuff did I play this week?

17:28.750 --> 17:29.351
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

17:29.491 --> 17:29.691
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

17:30.551 --> 17:31.231
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of new stuff.

17:31.251 --> 17:31.532
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

17:31.852 --> 17:32.192
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

17:32.592 --> 17:32.932
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

17:33.292 --> 17:34.033
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play WoW.

17:34.133 --> 17:39.495
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I played the WoW beta today because I finally got my character to copy over, so I was able to look at the new zones.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you done any of the sillies or the flirts?

17:42.776 --> 17:44.617
[SPEAKER_03]: They are raunchy!

17:44.797 --> 17:46.098
[SPEAKER_03]: For the new character?

17:46.158 --> 17:48.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for goblins and... I haven't.

17:48.559 --> 18:01.505
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a worgen to like level 6, and I got all excited because female worgens showed up like this week, but you can't... You can make one and see what it looks like, but you can't actually click the button that says create the character.

18:01.525 --> 18:03.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it says decline or whatever.

18:03.225 --> 18:03.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, invalid.

18:03.866 --> 18:04.486
[SPEAKER_10]: That's bootsy.

18:04.506 --> 18:04.846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

18:05.566 --> 18:09.347
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a PG-13 thing anymore.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like getting into R-rated material.

18:12.488 --> 18:17.430
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the female goblins, I think it's a flirt, was like, yeah, and then he asked me to go up on him.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.591
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, what the hell?

18:20.651 --> 18:21.631
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty funny.

18:21.651 --> 18:22.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're just getting too old.

18:22.872 --> 18:26.093
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but then there was another one where he's like, I've got something for you.

18:26.193 --> 18:28.253
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he just unzips his pants.

18:28.873 --> 18:31.694
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just straight up sexual.

18:32.514 --> 18:34.115
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not teenager stuff.

18:34.511 --> 18:36.892
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Rob was like, let's release the Sassy Squad.

18:36.973 --> 18:37.773
[SPEAKER_18]: He took his pants off.

18:37.873 --> 18:39.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I quit playing WoW at the wrong time?

18:40.615 --> 18:41.916
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the Sassy Squad anymore.

18:41.956 --> 18:43.056
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm paladin now.

18:43.076 --> 18:43.396
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

18:43.617 --> 18:44.377
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo.

18:44.397 --> 18:45.378
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have the sassy hair.

18:45.738 --> 18:49.480
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but Alan plays the Boomkin now.

18:49.540 --> 18:50.681
[SPEAKER_10]: So he has a Sassy Squad.

18:50.701 --> 18:51.501
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not what they're called.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Not nearly as sassy as your squad.

18:53.002 --> 18:53.142
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

18:54.603 --> 18:56.044
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually is really good.

18:56.444 --> 18:58.425
[SPEAKER_10]: He really is a great Boomkin.

18:58.666 --> 18:59.146
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big fucking geek.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not just saying that because he's listening.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.329
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows what he's doing in that game.

19:03.470 --> 19:03.850
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.171
[SPEAKER_03]: I just push three buttons.

19:05.211 --> 19:09.055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hunter, you know, but he's like, oh, you just do this to raise your hit cap and blah, blah, blah.

19:09.095 --> 19:09.676
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what?

19:11.218 --> 19:11.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Speak English.

19:14.821 --> 19:21.308
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing is that the beta, I started playing the beta today with my paladin and going into some of the new Love Lady areas.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.011
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went to Mount Hyjal, right, and started fighting some of the new monsters.

19:24.491 --> 19:25.592
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow got hard.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.492
[SPEAKER_10]: It did.

19:26.752 --> 19:31.094
[SPEAKER_10]: Like all of a sudden, like I went from having two heels to having like six.

19:31.355 --> 19:31.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

19:31.615 --> 19:33.356
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know like which one to cast.

19:33.696 --> 19:38.058
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my rep palette is like all like, oh, now you got to have holy power to do all this shit.

19:38.258 --> 19:39.699
[SPEAKER_10]: And oh my God, they changed everything.

19:39.759 --> 19:40.139
[SPEAKER_10]: It hurts.

19:40.239 --> 19:49.682
[SPEAKER_03]: They did, and Extifer, our buddy Extifer, he tried to heal for one of the raids, and he's like, I couldn't keep anyone above 50% health, and blah, blah, blah.

19:49.742 --> 19:54.023
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I don't really know what that means because I'm not a healer, but that sucks, I guess.

19:54.504 --> 19:54.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

19:55.484 --> 19:57.865
[SPEAKER_03]: You make it sound like it's terrible, so I guess it is.

19:58.005 --> 20:00.125
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he was saying it was really hard.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.206
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what I have?

20:01.906 --> 20:02.846
[SPEAKER_05]: Photon torpedoes.

20:04.107 --> 20:04.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

20:04.327 --> 20:05.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've got quantum torpedoes.

20:06.427 --> 20:08.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm using transphasic torpedoes.

20:10.902 --> 20:12.463
[SPEAKER_10]: Why aren't you playing Star Trek Online?

20:12.523 --> 20:14.864
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he doesn't play MMOs.

20:14.925 --> 20:16.045
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried playing WoW for like a week.

20:16.065 --> 20:17.306
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what he did in WoW?

20:17.686 --> 20:24.410
[SPEAKER_03]: He would hide in the Moonwell ponds and do Shadowmeld and when someone would run by he'd go boo and come out of Shadowmeld.

20:25.011 --> 20:27.752
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the extent of his experience in WoW.

20:30.714 --> 20:32.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Why didn't he play on a roleplay server?

20:32.635 --> 20:33.216
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why?

20:33.236 --> 20:35.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Because his computer lagged so hard.

20:36.038 --> 20:38.339
[SPEAKER_03]: He would run in place like eight times and just

20:38.912 --> 20:44.257
[SPEAKER_18]: My computer had like 200 megabytes of RAM, and so it was like I couldn't play WoW, so it was terrible.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.197
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what I did.

20:45.638 --> 20:49.621
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had to upgrade my graphics card and everything to run Star Trek Online decently.

20:49.881 --> 20:50.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

20:50.782 --> 20:51.082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

20:51.362 --> 20:55.726
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, the chat room's all bitching like, oh, I don't understand what you're talking about.

20:55.746 --> 20:56.867
[SPEAKER_10]: You lost me after Paladin.

20:56.927 --> 21:00.550
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go play Shattered Memories and get shit on my face.

21:00.830 --> 21:01.651
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me move on.

21:01.671 --> 21:02.692
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

21:02.932 --> 21:06.355
[SPEAKER_10]: And then SSJ100Matt says, at least it's better than Final Fantasy XI.

21:07.062 --> 21:08.323
[SPEAKER_03]: That's totally true.

21:08.503 --> 21:09.163
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not saying much.

21:09.183 --> 21:10.824
[SPEAKER_10]: What about 14, huh?

21:11.164 --> 21:12.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that gem.

21:12.065 --> 21:12.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not go there.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.567
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, and then I played some iPhone games.

21:16.627 --> 21:21.230
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, speaking of MMOs, I played a new iPhone MMO that's so much better than the one I played last week.

21:21.650 --> 21:24.332
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is called, I forget the name.

21:24.392 --> 21:25.592
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Legends.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

21:27.093 --> 21:28.874
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's short for something else.

21:28.994 --> 21:30.815
[SPEAKER_10]: Player Legends or Play Legends or something.

21:30.855 --> 21:31.276
[SPEAKER_10]: It's free.

21:31.956 --> 21:32.396
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat.

21:32.816 --> 21:33.157
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got 3D.

21:34.150 --> 21:36.213
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds unique and not generic at all.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's horrible.

21:56.795 --> 22:04.940
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I watch Hoarders because A, Alan likes to joke about how that's going to be us in like 20 years, but B, it actually makes me feel better about myself.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.782
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you'd asked me before I'd watched that show, like, Rob, are you a hoarder?

22:08.802 --> 22:11.003
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably would have said, yeah, I'm a little bit of a hoarder.

22:11.303 --> 22:13.905
[SPEAKER_10]: But after watching that show, I'm like, no, no, absolutely not.

22:13.925 --> 22:14.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, hell no.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.526
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd never let it get that bad.

22:16.706 --> 22:19.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty bad on that show.

22:19.228 --> 22:20.788
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you're just getting a little...

22:22.210 --> 22:24.053
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, I've known you for a while.

22:24.734 --> 22:24.994
You know.

22:26.326 --> 22:30.368
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the things on that show are really, I would never let an animal die under all this stuff.

22:30.649 --> 22:31.369
[SPEAKER_03]: That you know of.

22:31.729 --> 22:32.150
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

22:32.170 --> 22:32.410
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

22:33.270 --> 22:33.690
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

22:34.551 --> 22:36.692
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why Rob doesn't have a kitty.

22:37.072 --> 22:38.353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or Zach and Kelly.

22:38.513 --> 22:39.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember them?

22:39.514 --> 22:40.294
[SPEAKER_10]: That was different.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.816
[SPEAKER_03]: That was different, huh?

22:42.896 --> 22:46.598
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't die under the weight of crap around the house or anything.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.960
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually had their own little tank that they could swim around in.

22:50.000 --> 22:50.660
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not my fault.

22:50.961 --> 22:53.202
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them decided to swim right up the filter and die.

22:53.562 --> 22:54.823
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened to the other one?

22:55.984 --> 22:57.145
[SPEAKER_10]: I flushed him down the toilet.

22:57.165 --> 22:57.626
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

22:57.906 --> 22:59.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it alive when you did?

22:59.308 --> 22:59.848
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

22:59.888 --> 23:01.590
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one died of sadness.

23:03.212 --> 23:05.475
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't feed him for a week and he was so sad.

23:05.555 --> 23:06.256
[SPEAKER_10]: He died.

23:06.936 --> 23:12.863
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, if your little fish friend just decided to seppuku up the filter when you're just... I don't think you seppuku'd.

23:12.923 --> 23:14.445
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you bought the wrong one.

23:14.485 --> 23:15.246
[SPEAKER_03]: You murdered!

23:15.706 --> 23:17.947
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:45.623 --> 23:49.110
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I like the Futurama spoof where it was like, here's a twit now.

23:50.733 --> 23:51.234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

23:51.474 --> 23:52.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

23:53.397 --> 23:54.219
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where you can go.

23:55.521 --> 23:55.802
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

23:56.363 --> 23:58.884
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have any cute shoes How about video game news?

23:59.244 --> 24:08.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Actual bonafide video game news Because the Tokyo Game Show happened this week So there's a lot of news out of there But we're not starting there tonight, actually What a horrible segue Where are we starting tonight, Loki?

24:09.567 --> 24:23.372
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes, we're starting with This is funny because I could have been affected by this But thanks to procrastination I was not The MMO APB Or what I like to call Grand Theft Auto The MMO

24:25.013 --> 24:45.631
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a cops and robbers MMO game developed by Realtime Worlds who did the wonderful game Crackdown and it launched in the US on June 29th and basically had players playing both the Enforcers and Criminals and...

24:47.092 --> 24:47.772
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:10.343 --> 25:21.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Real-time worlds faced massive layoffs last month and I guess before going into administration, which is I guess the UK equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.210
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, the...

25:26.577 --> 25:27.718
[SPEAKER_09]: They weren't doing too well.

25:29.399 --> 25:36.663
[SPEAKER_09]: The quote on the official website is, APB had a fantastic journey, but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end.

25:37.083 --> 25:42.626
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service running, APB is coming to a close.

25:43.086 --> 25:49.249
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been a pleasure working on APB, and with all of its players together, we will be building an absolutely amazing game.

25:49.790 --> 25:53.231
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we were building an absolutely amazing game, and for that we thank you.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.052
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are awesome.

25:54.412 --> 25:57.534
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thousands of you that paid for this game just got effed in the A, right?

25:58.795 --> 25:59.335
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah.

25:59.536 --> 26:01.317
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not hearing a lot about the backlash.

26:01.337 --> 26:03.698
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it just because literally no one bought this game?

26:03.999 --> 26:10.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, I mean, it seems so strange to me that an MMO could just get away with shutting down after three months.

26:10.223 --> 26:11.604
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't even really an MMO.

26:11.704 --> 26:15.886
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's barely an MMO, especially by today's standards for multiplayer games.

26:16.427 --> 26:21.410
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was 100 player instances, basically, that you got to play in.

26:21.770 --> 26:23.351
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you play it offline, though?

26:23.732 --> 26:23.832
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

26:24.613 --> 26:32.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so if you dropped $60 on this game just three months ago, you paid $20 a month and then some for... Bleh.

26:32.942 --> 26:33.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

26:34.184 --> 26:34.885
[SPEAKER_10]: That stinks.

26:36.873 --> 26:40.155
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if any of our listeners are the type that get...

27:05.092 --> 27:10.376
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you talked about this game an awful lot before it came out, and then you didn't.

27:10.556 --> 27:12.077
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, did you even get into it?

27:12.237 --> 27:15.179
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in the beta, so I played it for a little bit.

27:15.879 --> 27:16.460
[SPEAKER_09]: It was okay.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.782
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of those things I didn't want to buy because I didn't think I had time to play it.

27:20.763 --> 27:23.404
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I had, I definitely wouldn't have had time to play it.

27:23.504 --> 27:25.926
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I didn't buy it.

27:26.426 --> 27:27.547
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun to check it out.

27:29.468 --> 27:33.291
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too bad because I think it would have worked better as a console game

27:35.372 --> 27:39.455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like something that should have been as a Saints Row type of thing or something like that.

27:40.276 --> 27:52.484
[SPEAKER_09]: Have the actual main storyline and everything and have some really fleshed out online mode where you can play either the cops or the enforcers and level up and have a really cool character editor and stuff like that.

27:53.204 --> 27:55.406
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I could have saw this being, but it wasn't.

27:57.207 --> 28:04.672
[SPEAKER_09]: However, all may not be lost because apparently Epic Games is interested in buying the rights to the game.

28:06.093 --> 28:09.835
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we'll see APB come back in some other form.

28:11.095 --> 28:11.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Be interesting.

28:13.517 --> 28:26.324
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Eurogamer was reporting this, saying that according to the BBC, sourced close to the development team, a few companies are showing interest in picking up APB's rights.

28:27.324 --> 28:30.406
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently one of those companies is Epic Games.

28:31.406 --> 28:34.228
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the company behind the Gears of War and Unreal Tournament series.

28:35.028 --> 28:48.973
[SPEAKER_09]: And also adding to the speculation, Eurogamer, they were citing Dundee Development Source, in real time, I guess was based in Dundee, Scotland, that Dave Jones, the real time world's boss...

28:49.853 --> 28:55.377
[SPEAKER_09]: and Epic is quite the talking point in the town.

28:55.517 --> 29:05.024
[SPEAKER_09]: He says he and Mr. Rain are good chums and have worked together on many levels for years and years and years and he's not going to raise much money and staff here in the near future.

29:07.296 --> 29:09.317
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sounding like that maybe Epic will buy them.

29:10.297 --> 29:15.458
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's good, but still, I mean, what type of precedence is this set for the future?

29:15.498 --> 29:22.360
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm still just picturing, you know, thousands, or well, at least hundreds of angry gamers that bought this game.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Tens of angry gamers.

29:23.840 --> 29:29.402
[SPEAKER_10]: Tens of angry gamers that bought this game that feel really screwed about it closing.

29:30.002 --> 29:30.482
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

29:33.638 --> 29:36.800
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first time this has ever happened on The Sims that the shirt just disappears.

29:36.880 --> 29:41.582
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura doesn't prefer to actually listen to the show when it's going on.

29:41.702 --> 29:45.644
[SPEAKER_10]: She plays The Sims while the show's going on and we all look over there.

29:45.664 --> 29:48.305
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, don't know why, we just all kind of look over at her computer.

29:48.345 --> 29:55.809
[SPEAKER_10]: She's dressing some character right now and it's a female character she's dressing and we look over there and no top, no top on, just titties hanging out.

29:57.603 --> 29:59.645
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of game are you playing over there?

29:59.705 --> 30:03.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, I tried to change her shirt and all of a sudden her boobs just pop out.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.009
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens.

30:07.691 --> 30:11.495
[SPEAKER_10]: Question in our chatroom at chat.orangelaundry.com or more of a statement from our buddy Seg.

30:11.515 --> 30:12.676
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen him in chat in forever.

30:12.696 --> 30:14.397
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Seg.

30:14.837 --> 30:18.080
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch it become like Uru missed online and never die.

30:18.460 --> 30:21.243
[SPEAKER_10]: Missed online got resurrected about three or four times.

30:21.923 --> 30:22.384
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

30:23.092 --> 30:23.672
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be neat.

30:23.692 --> 30:24.193
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

30:24.253 --> 30:28.195
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, you know, doing 100 player instances is not really an MMO.

30:28.215 --> 30:29.675
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look at MAG.

30:29.875 --> 30:35.258
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's, I think, what, got 128 players at a time?

30:35.718 --> 30:36.959
[SPEAKER_09]: And they all call it an MMO.

30:37.099 --> 30:40.861
[SPEAKER_09]: They call it like an MMO action game, I guess, or something like that.

30:41.101 --> 30:48.808
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is all an elaborate scheme to justify the online pass because the people who made this game didn't charge for the online pass, did they?

30:49.228 --> 30:53.512
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they're going to say, well, because we weren't charging the $10 premium, we had to shut down the servers.

30:53.532 --> 30:54.473
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't make any sense.

30:54.573 --> 30:58.096
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would they charge for an online pass if they're charging for online anyways?

30:58.457 --> 30:59.017
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

30:59.037 --> 31:00.819
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a used market for PC titles.

31:00.839 --> 31:01.539
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why not?

31:01.599 --> 31:02.881
[SPEAKER_10]: What's stopping them these days?

31:03.161 --> 31:03.521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

31:03.561 --> 31:04.882
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to pay another $10 for online access.

31:07.004 --> 31:08.866
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't play without online access.

31:09.046 --> 31:09.947
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.

31:10.127 --> 31:20.194
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, every time we play these games, especially the online ones, we have to accept terms of conditions, a user agreement, basically, right?

31:20.715 --> 31:25.318
[SPEAKER_10]: When are we going to make the company sign the company agreement when we buy their games?

31:26.179 --> 31:31.663
[SPEAKER_10]: If I plop $60 on this game, you need to keep the damn servers up for at least a year or X, Y, Z.

31:34.329 --> 31:43.568
[SPEAKER_10]: Unrealistic, yes, but I just think this is a bad precedence if this just kind of slips away and people are just like, oh, well, it was a crappy game anyway.

31:45.675 --> 31:45.995
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh well.

31:46.455 --> 31:53.957
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should get their money back, or people that bought it should get their money back, but unfortunately the company has no money to give back, so... Oh well.

31:55.497 --> 31:55.877
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad.

31:57.238 --> 31:57.698
[SPEAKER_10]: Live and learn.

31:58.138 --> 32:02.799
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if you have one of those Best Buy replacement plans, you can go take the game back and say it don't work no more.

32:03.779 --> 32:04.159
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

32:04.239 --> 32:04.579
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.060
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if that works.

32:07.300 --> 32:13.143
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that might have worked a little better had it come out would have been this patent that was discovered by Sony last week.

32:13.184 --> 32:15.725
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a last-gen console adapter.

32:17.146 --> 32:24.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Could explain why there was never PS2 backwards compatibility after, of course, the very, very first PlayStation 3 console.

32:25.190 --> 32:27.832
[SPEAKER_10]: It was removed from the console pretty quickly to help cut down on cost.

32:28.192 --> 32:32.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there were rumors that it was going to come out on the download service, the PlayStation Network.

32:32.614 --> 32:35.416
[SPEAKER_10]: We would see PlayStation 2 games, but that never seemed to happen either.

32:36.056 --> 32:52.031
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently one of the tech sites over in Japan, Gigazine, discovered a patent that was filed by Sony Japan back in February of 2009, which described an adapter, and it would serve as a bridge for older gen games to be played on a current gen console.

32:52.392 --> 32:58.077
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, when I look at the picture, it looks like you are attaching a PlayStation 2 to your PlayStation 3.

32:58.157 --> 33:00.179
[SPEAKER_09]: That is retarded.

33:00.720 --> 33:00.980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.803
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it bad I still kind of want one?

33:04.263 --> 33:04.864
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

33:05.264 --> 33:06.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what they would do, too.

33:06.225 --> 33:07.046
[SPEAKER_09]: They would charge like $150 for that.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.609
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though the PS2 is $100.

33:09.649 --> 33:11.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

33:11.671 --> 33:12.592
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they don't learn.

33:12.652 --> 33:15.915
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, you know, oh, hey, we're going to release this system.

33:15.955 --> 33:17.297
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to call it the PSP Go.

33:17.937 --> 33:31.363
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah we know that the regular PSP is out right now for like $150 and that it can play UMD discs but this new PSP that we're releasing it's not going to be able to play UMD discs you're going to have to download all your tiles oh and we're going to charge $200 for it oh I'm sorry no $250 for it

33:34.111 --> 33:34.712
[SPEAKER_10]: Smart.

33:34.932 --> 33:37.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, something to keep in mind, just to be technical.

33:37.294 --> 33:38.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and a PS3.

33:38.035 --> 33:38.355
[SPEAKER_09]: That's only $2.99.

33:38.395 --> 33:43.159
[SPEAKER_10]: The patent doesn't specifically say it's for PlayStation 2 games.

33:43.860 --> 33:46.002
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just for older games.

33:46.122 --> 33:50.766
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you think about it, okay, PlayStation 3 already plays PlayStation 1 games.

33:51.327 --> 33:51.827
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

33:51.887 --> 33:54.289
[SPEAKER_10]: You need this additional adapter to play.

33:54.309 --> 33:59.154
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's going to play Dreamcast games and Sega CD games.

33:59.674 --> 34:01.455
[SPEAKER_10]: It plays HD DVD.

34:01.555 --> 34:01.956
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew?

34:02.136 --> 34:02.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.177
[SPEAKER_03]: That's backwards compatible.

34:04.557 --> 34:04.878
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.299
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

34:06.699 --> 34:09.341
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't sound like this would be too incredibly popular if it came out.

34:09.441 --> 34:09.821
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

34:10.401 --> 34:13.023
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was the right price, I'd probably buy it.

34:13.143 --> 34:13.703
[SPEAKER_10]: You know why?

34:13.804 --> 34:15.665
[SPEAKER_10]: To save on the shelf space.

34:16.305 --> 34:19.467
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't... How do you figure?

34:19.747 --> 34:24.911
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if I have to get a PlayStation 2 out to hook up, that's a whole other AC adapter.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.992
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole other set of RGB cords.

34:27.012 --> 34:29.054
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other... Girlfriend, you just lazy.

34:29.974 --> 34:31.135
[SPEAKER_03]: You... Yeah, pretty much.

34:31.155 --> 34:31.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Lazy.

34:31.595 --> 34:32.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

34:32.416 --> 34:32.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you're wrong.

34:33.016 --> 34:34.978
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not another set of RGB courts.

34:35.098 --> 34:37.920
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually the exact same set.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.141
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have to move it from the PS3 to PS2.

34:40.321 --> 34:40.662
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

34:40.682 --> 34:42.303
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably just spypainted a PS2.

34:42.323 --> 34:43.484
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's definitely worth $150.

34:43.524 --> 34:43.904
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

34:44.544 --> 34:47.707
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, oh, let's change this to an off-gray.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can spend, I don't know, $10...

34:52.930 --> 34:53.651
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

35:16.455 --> 35:20.238
[SPEAKER_10]: This Screeching Hall was brought to you by DarkSakura and her lovely insights.

35:23.641 --> 35:26.403
[SPEAKER_10]: What if it like up-res the resolution of the game?

35:26.503 --> 35:29.025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'd be so amazing.

35:29.325 --> 35:30.786
[SPEAKER_10]: If only a console did that already.

35:30.987 --> 35:33.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, the PlayStation 3 does.

35:33.228 --> 35:34.770
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so crazy.

35:34.790 --> 35:35.630
[SPEAKER_10]: But not for PS2 games.

35:36.271 --> 35:39.013
[SPEAKER_09]: It did if you got one of the launch systems.

35:39.033 --> 35:39.794
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, too bad...

35:40.274 --> 35:41.895
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of people bought one of the launches.

35:41.915 --> 35:43.937
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you should have done that.

35:44.257 --> 35:45.638
[SPEAKER_10]: Lower your standards.

35:45.658 --> 35:47.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me $700 or whatever the hell those things cost back then.

35:47.980 --> 35:48.581
[SPEAKER_10]: They were crazy.

35:48.601 --> 35:48.921
[SPEAKER_10]: $599 US dollars.

35:48.941 --> 35:49.041
[SPEAKER_10]: Well.

35:54.246 --> 35:54.666
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

35:55.227 --> 35:56.087
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm over it.

35:56.107 --> 35:58.628
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are mean.

35:58.648 --> 36:05.012
[SPEAKER_09]: The best part about that though is I have one of those systems that plays PlayStation 2 games and I don't play any PlayStation 2 games in it at all.

36:05.032 --> 36:11.175
[SPEAKER_10]: I would play Final Fantasy 12, .hack because I never did beat it, and Magic Pen Gel.

36:11.315 --> 36:13.156
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't you have a PS2 already?

36:13.616 --> 36:14.737
[SPEAKER_10]: In a box somewhere.

36:14.757 --> 36:17.999
[SPEAKER_05]: We've used ours to play PS2 games.

36:19.434 --> 36:21.375
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to actually look for my PS2.

36:21.395 --> 36:24.517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go buy this thing for my PS3.

36:24.537 --> 36:25.498
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't understand.

36:25.618 --> 36:26.439
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.901
[SPEAKER_10]: A, there's no guarantee the PS2 still works.

36:30.401 --> 36:34.724
[SPEAKER_10]: B, it's a whole other set of cords that you have to hook into the back of the TV.

36:34.824 --> 36:36.465
[SPEAKER_03]: God, you must be the laziest person.

36:36.485 --> 36:39.786
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no guarantee that it works, so I'm not even going to try.

36:39.966 --> 36:43.587
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to drop this hundred whatever the fuck dollars on this thing.

36:43.647 --> 36:49.269
[SPEAKER_05]: You were here the other week when we had the 32X hooked up, and that's a whole bunch of cables.

36:49.949 --> 36:50.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

37:13.431 --> 37:24.719
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that my TV has something like three HDMI things and then a bunch of AV and like some S-video and like the little one that you use the switch for.

37:25.019 --> 37:25.660
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's nice.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.021
[SPEAKER_10]: My TV is from Costco.

37:27.121 --> 37:28.401
[SPEAKER_10]: So is ours.

37:28.662 --> 37:30.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Our TV is from Costco.

37:30.603 --> 37:32.284
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not a valid excuse.

37:32.424 --> 37:34.746
[SPEAKER_05]: I rendered your excuse invalid.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.368
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear my thing only has like two inputs and an HDMI.

37:37.388 --> 37:38.148
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yours sucks.

37:38.168 --> 37:38.889
[SPEAKER_10]: You should return it.

37:39.489 --> 37:41.632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry that your thing only has two inputs.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story!

37:47.358 --> 37:50.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about some more PS3 news?

37:51.143 --> 37:54.006
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be a new system update 3.42.

37:54.527 --> 37:57.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't they just give them regular numbers instead of points?

37:58.331 --> 37:59.952
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't it be update number 4?

38:00.212 --> 38:00.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Update number 5?

38:01.053 --> 38:01.113
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

38:01.133 --> 38:03.154
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now they'd be at update number 62.

38:03.574 --> 38:04.495
[SPEAKER_10]: They're bitches.

38:04.515 --> 38:09.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the whole number updates are for major, major, major updates.

38:09.618 --> 38:11.920
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is just, hey, we're adding Blu-ray.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the next one is 3.5.

38:14.701 --> 38:16.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we just got 3.42.

38:17.623 --> 38:23.567
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one is going to add 3D Blu-ray movie support since it can already do 3D with games.

38:25.048 --> 38:36.356
[SPEAKER_05]: And that date is actually out for the Japanese market on September 21st, but I guess it's going to be after?

38:37.236 --> 38:37.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you screw driving?

38:37.836 --> 38:38.256
[SPEAKER_05]: He's screwing me.

38:38.276 --> 38:38.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you screw driving?

39:00.922 --> 39:01.903
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a Sony TV.

39:02.503 --> 39:03.624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting you a Sony TV.

39:04.024 --> 39:05.085
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be a 3D TV.

39:05.406 --> 39:07.047
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell your Sony rep to get me a TV.

39:07.067 --> 39:08.228
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you watch Avatar?

39:08.848 --> 39:09.929
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we can't.

39:10.029 --> 39:12.191
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not 3D Blu-ray.

39:12.211 --> 39:17.815
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that will be in the super extended Uber James Cameron's cock Blu-ray edition.

39:17.915 --> 39:18.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

39:18.636 --> 39:21.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Until then, though, all we have is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

39:21.718 --> 39:24.980
[SPEAKER_09]: That's seriously the only damn movie that's in 3D.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.702
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is also James Cameron's cock.

39:29.438 --> 39:31.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, by the way, don't watch... It's meaty balls.

39:31.379 --> 39:32.720
[SPEAKER_10]: Cloudy with a chance of balls.

39:34.141 --> 39:34.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameron balls.

39:35.662 --> 39:39.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't watch Resident Evil Afterlife, and especially don't watch it in 3D.

39:41.901 --> 39:42.762
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

39:42.822 --> 39:43.903
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't you like that?

39:43.923 --> 39:44.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see it.

39:44.704 --> 39:45.444
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kidding, right?

39:45.484 --> 39:46.365
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I liked it.

39:46.985 --> 39:47.866
[SPEAKER_03]: You're being facetious.

39:47.906 --> 39:48.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me you're being facetious.

39:48.947 --> 39:49.567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not being facetious.

39:49.587 --> 39:49.868
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me.

39:49.908 --> 39:50.928
[SPEAKER_03]: My head's going to explode.

39:50.989 --> 39:51.289
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

39:52.430 --> 39:57.314
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be one of the only movies that I would actually want to go see in 3D because you know it's going to be ridiculous.

39:57.354 --> 40:00.496
[SPEAKER_18]: You know it's just like going to an amusement park.

40:00.656 --> 40:00.916
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.418
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you not like about it?

40:03.530 --> 40:06.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, the movie itself was fucking ridiculous and stupid.

40:07.334 --> 40:10.057
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3D was obviously the added-on 3D.

40:10.298 --> 40:11.239
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't shot in 3D.

40:11.279 --> 40:12.160
[SPEAKER_03]: It was shot in 3D.

40:12.320 --> 40:12.740
[SPEAKER_03]: It was?

40:12.821 --> 40:16.885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they actually, even when they were writing the script, they were writing with 3D in mind.

40:16.925 --> 40:19.648
[SPEAKER_03]: When they were writing the script of Dawn of the Dead.

40:19.989 --> 40:21.931
[SPEAKER_10]: They used the same cameras as Avatar did.

40:21.971 --> 40:22.752
[SPEAKER_10]: It was this big deal.

40:22.952 --> 40:23.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

40:24.112 --> 40:31.934
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but, okay, we actually, we went and saw that, I went and saw that actually on, uh, last week, um, with the D-Box seats.

40:31.954 --> 40:35.335
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've heard about those, the motion seats that actually move and rumble and stuff.

40:35.775 --> 40:36.755
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool, okay?

40:36.795 --> 40:38.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that might have added to it.

40:38.615 --> 40:50.238
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the thing, though, I don't really play the Resident Evil games, so for me, this movie was kind of like, hey, look, it's almost like The Matrix, but not, you know, so I don't know if the storyline ruined it for you, because I couldn't care, you know?

40:50.298 --> 40:52.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the storyline was stupid, and

40:52.538 --> 40:58.100
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the extent of the 3D stuff was just, oh, look at this blood flying in your face.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at this building.

40:59.380 --> 41:02.061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crumbling and some of the crumbles are falling in your face.

41:02.361 --> 41:04.242
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing exciting about it.

41:04.282 --> 41:08.403
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just an old crotchety woman that doesn't like 3D, which is entirely possible.

41:08.423 --> 41:09.483
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of gimmicky stuff in there.

41:09.563 --> 41:10.123
[SPEAKER_03]: It was stupid shit, man.

41:10.143 --> 41:11.984
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of throwing stuff at the camera.

41:12.084 --> 41:12.184
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

41:12.364 --> 41:14.625
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I'm throwing my glasses at the camera.

41:14.665 --> 41:15.965
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm throwing my axe at the camera.

41:16.166 --> 41:19.827
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but that's like one of the only movies that I would go, okay, that's in 3D, that makes sense.

41:19.847 --> 41:22.708
[SPEAKER_18]: But like, Eat, Pray, Love, I mean, that doesn't need to be in 3D.

41:23.748 --> 41:24.629
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that really in 3D?

41:24.669 --> 41:27.270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna pray.

41:28.550 --> 41:31.371
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was extending my folded hands forward.

41:32.512 --> 41:34.653
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and just the movie itself was really stupid.

41:34.693 --> 41:39.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, literally, it was Dawn of the Dead, except with Resident Evil people.

41:39.455 --> 41:39.935
[SPEAKER_10]: Spoilers.

41:40.575 --> 41:41.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

41:42.296 --> 41:43.397
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen it before.

41:43.477 --> 41:47.319
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we go through this whole 3D craze back in the 80s with like Jaws 3D?

41:47.440 --> 41:47.840
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

41:49.081 --> 41:49.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like five.

41:50.341 --> 41:56.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think, okay, right now in Sony, they were kind of bad for doing it.

41:58.066 --> 42:02.409
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation 3 when it first came out was like $600, and they're like, well, that's because it has Blu-ray in it.

42:02.789 --> 42:05.331
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, everyone complained, I don't give a fuck, it's $600.

42:06.191 --> 42:06.891
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not buying it.

42:07.672 --> 42:11.274
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because they're kind of jumping, they're trying to push the technology too much.

42:11.494 --> 42:26.483
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like 3D TV, I'm glad you're supporting 3D with your games, and I'm glad you're supporting 3D Blu-ray, because probably you have a little bit of an investment in it, since, I don't know, you have a lot of Blu-ray stuff, you are your own movie company and whatnot.

42:27.223 --> 42:48.910
[SPEAKER_09]: um so obviously they're trying to invest some of that in there but it's really not viable now to buy a 3d tv or a 3d blu-ray player because there's hardly any content for it and if you just wait it's gonna get damn cheaper anyways and there's probably something better gonna come out you know they're gonna come out with tvs that don't require stupid glasses on you

42:49.170 --> 43:00.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Salacious Pop is in chat and follows up the comment about Eat, Pray, Love in 3D saying Julia Roberts' mouth in 3D would be a sin of technology.

43:00.243 --> 43:02.385
[SPEAKER_03]: See 3D birds.

43:04.347 --> 43:08.530
[SPEAKER_10]: There's this picture I sometimes see on Oh No They Didn't and somebody needs to link it in chat.

43:08.790 --> 43:10.351
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, find this picture.

43:10.771 --> 43:17.295
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a picture of Julia Roberts but it's been photoshopped to really exaggerate her horse mouth and it's really scary.

43:17.335 --> 43:19.196
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes her look like a zombie in Resident Evil.

43:19.216 --> 43:21.598
[SPEAKER_03]: She already has an exaggerated horse mouth.

43:21.658 --> 43:22.818
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to see the picture.

43:22.838 --> 43:23.359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so scary.

43:23.379 --> 43:24.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it, Alan.

43:25.760 --> 43:26.521
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody will find it for me.

43:27.221 --> 43:29.722
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says Rob's still waiting for Showgirls 3D.

43:30.763 --> 43:31.464
[SPEAKER_10]: True story.

43:31.644 --> 43:33.526
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, you want to hear a true story?

43:34.267 --> 43:36.829
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought Showgirls on Blu-ray this week for $18.

43:36.909 --> 43:37.490
[SPEAKER_10]: It was on sale.

43:37.510 --> 43:38.110
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

43:39.672 --> 43:41.173
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go watch it.

43:42.255 --> 43:43.896
[SPEAKER_10]: I should come over and we should have a Showgirls party.

43:44.036 --> 43:44.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

43:44.957 --> 43:46.459
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to watch the TV version.

43:46.559 --> 43:48.661
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have brown rice and vegetables, Rob.

43:51.284 --> 43:52.665
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have a whole little Showgirls party.

43:52.685 --> 43:53.165
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be fun.

43:53.506 --> 43:53.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

43:55.083 --> 43:57.264
[SPEAKER_09]: That is seriously a movie that needs to be in 3D though.

43:58.044 --> 44:02.327
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not Eat, Pray, Love.

44:02.607 --> 44:03.307
[SPEAKER_09]: Showgirls.

44:03.707 --> 44:06.208
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, Showgirls.

44:06.689 --> 44:07.349
[SPEAKER_09]: Not striptease.

44:07.489 --> 44:08.269
[SPEAKER_09]: No one wants to see that.

44:08.309 --> 44:09.890
[SPEAKER_18]: I want Saved by the Bell 3D then.

44:10.491 --> 44:13.792
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because they had, was it the Piranha 3D or whatever?

44:13.812 --> 44:17.734
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had a whole bunch of like, oh, it's wet t-shirt contest type stuff.

44:18.314 --> 44:20.275
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need more of that with less of the piranhas.

44:20.315 --> 44:23.697
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the piranhas are cool and all, but you don't need to mix them both together.

44:23.965 --> 44:28.550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like Nomi's nipples are going to be coming out into your face.

44:28.650 --> 44:32.033
[SPEAKER_09]: But can you imagine, you know, the really weird thrash sex she was doing?

44:32.073 --> 44:33.174
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that in 3D?

44:33.194 --> 44:34.255
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be some scary stuff.

44:34.275 --> 44:35.196
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be scary.

44:35.276 --> 44:38.219
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be like, ah, what the fuck is that?

44:38.259 --> 44:39.120
[SPEAKER_03]: You gonna die?

44:40.381 --> 44:42.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch, I know what's happening in this movie.

44:42.344 --> 44:42.945
[SPEAKER_03]: You going down.

44:43.266 --> 44:45.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Rob, close it now.

44:45.188 --> 44:45.789
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it.

44:46.971 --> 44:49.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, times a million.

44:49.955 --> 44:52.118
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the picture I was looking for, or one of them.

44:52.219 --> 44:53.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

44:53.761 --> 44:54.462
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

44:54.782 --> 44:55.822
[SPEAKER_10]: This is terrible radio.

44:56.583 --> 44:57.843
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me leave this nerd chat room.

44:57.903 --> 44:58.943
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on?

44:59.403 --> 45:02.024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I lost the don't shit my pants game.

45:02.524 --> 45:04.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that like Enzyte guy there?

45:05.325 --> 45:06.106
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

45:07.166 --> 45:07.786
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover it up.

45:07.866 --> 45:09.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover it up with that window.

45:09.727 --> 45:10.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Move it, Rob.

45:10.567 --> 45:10.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't.

45:11.567 --> 45:11.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

45:11.887 --> 45:12.407
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Google.

45:12.828 --> 45:13.628
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, or not Google.

45:13.648 --> 45:18.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Photobucket because they let you search your pictures and search for Julia Roberts GIF.

45:19.090 --> 45:20.030
[SPEAKER_10]: Julia Roberts GIF.

45:20.470 --> 45:21.990
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will come right up.

45:22.050 --> 45:22.851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the first image.

45:22.931 --> 45:23.611
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hilarious.

45:26.354 --> 45:26.794
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

45:28.856 --> 45:33.139
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator PSN says, I wouldn't mind seeing Angelina Jolie's boobs in 3D.

45:33.179 --> 45:33.700
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

45:34.800 --> 45:39.184
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Wanted might have been kind of cool in 3D because they tried to do some 3D-ish kind of things in that.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.865
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I could see that working.

45:40.985 --> 45:48.491
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and with a movie like that, that's just like, this movie is like so hetero, it's dick has a dick, like type of thing.

45:48.611 --> 45:49.412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's weird.

45:49.432 --> 45:50.692
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not very hetero right there.

45:51.173 --> 45:53.074
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not fuck a dick that had a dick.

45:53.134 --> 45:54.195
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awkward.

45:54.215 --> 45:55.236
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something right out of the...

45:56.756 --> 46:00.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm like, I gotta go now away from your dick.

46:00.357 --> 46:01.337
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean, though?

46:01.957 --> 46:02.678
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

46:03.038 --> 46:06.358
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be weird if the bullets went around your face in 3D.

46:06.698 --> 46:09.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I almost got shot.

46:10.759 --> 46:11.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

46:11.199 --> 46:11.879
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm gonna do?

46:11.899 --> 46:14.200
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna post that Julia Roberts gift to our Twitter.

46:14.420 --> 46:16.340
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

46:16.380 --> 46:17.781
[SPEAKER_03]: Move past it, Rob.

46:17.841 --> 46:21.381
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna see who's not listening to the show right now by seeing the responses we get.

46:21.841 --> 46:22.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

46:23.222 --> 46:24.222
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime...

46:25.134 --> 46:25.634
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it work?

46:27.316 --> 46:32.099
[SPEAKER_18]: So, back to the Doctor and Vice Princess show.

46:32.239 --> 46:32.979
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now that we're done with that topic, let's talk about Halo Reach and its shortcomings.

46:38.983 --> 46:44.967
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo Reach is an awesome game, but somebody didn't test it well enough, and that somebody would be Microsoft.

46:45.828 --> 46:51.670
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo Reach has problems playing on the brand new 4GB Xbox 360 Slimmer system.

46:52.950 --> 46:59.392
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because apparently co-op requires a hard drive in order to work, which is dumb to begin with.

47:01.113 --> 47:07.535
[SPEAKER_09]: The 4GB of storage that's on those new systems is kind of classified as a memory unit.

47:07.975 --> 47:13.857
[SPEAKER_09]: So therefore, despite the fact that you have adequate space to store whatever files they want you to store...

47:14.517 --> 47:14.957
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

47:33.615 --> 47:34.896
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to play with yourself.

47:35.057 --> 47:40.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, Microsoft has said that they're aware of the issue and this is going to be a temporary issue.

47:40.603 --> 47:42.144
[SPEAKER_09]: The company is working to resolve it.

47:42.685 --> 47:44.607
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, come on, man.

47:44.647 --> 47:46.709
[SPEAKER_09]: That should have been something that you should have tested first.

47:46.769 --> 47:52.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try playing this on each of our SKUs, especially the ones that have just come out, and let's see if it works correctly.

47:54.415 --> 47:57.337
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the biggest games for our company.

47:57.357 --> 47:58.957
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be important to do.

48:00.458 --> 48:00.978
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit.

48:02.539 --> 48:06.021
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe they're just trying to upsell those bigger console bundles.

48:06.081 --> 48:16.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let me buy your stupid 4GB system and then I have to buy a really expensive hard drive to plug into it because normal hard drives won't work.

48:17.787 --> 48:19.448
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite the fact that it's a normal hard drive.

48:21.089 --> 48:22.391
[SPEAKER_09]: but formatted differently.

48:23.773 --> 48:23.993
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

48:24.934 --> 48:25.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally.

48:25.295 --> 48:31.042
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't you just allow anybody to put their own hard drives in there?

48:31.543 --> 48:32.524
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like Sony.

48:33.325 --> 48:34.647
[SPEAKER_09]: At least they have that going for them.

48:37.378 --> 48:45.302
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well I'm going to move on to another story here about a website called Good Old Games and a lot of interesting developments that's going on today.

48:45.602 --> 48:52.245
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, after hearing about the developments, I kind of hesitate even bringing up this story on the show in the first place, but it's kind of bold what's going on.

48:53.385 --> 48:58.227
[SPEAKER_10]: Good Old Games is a website located at GOG.com, and we brought them up on the show before.

48:58.648 --> 49:10.032
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a website where you can buy old games, like the King's Quest series, and just old PC games from back in the day for $5 or $10, and it's all DRM-free.

49:10.433 --> 49:13.214
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Fallout 2, just older PC games.

49:13.574 --> 49:15.955
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of like legalized abandonware, basically.

49:16.215 --> 49:43.176
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, for companies that still want to sell their old games Well, they shut down today and posted a notice on their website that says We recently had to give serious thought as to whether we could really keep GOG.com going the way it is We've debated on it for quite some time and unfortunately we've decided that GOG.com simply cannot remain in its current form So the website, you know, a lot of news sites kind of post about this Oh, this is such a good idea, you know, it made this thing legal and, you know, it was good karma to buy the games and stuff

49:43.916 --> 50:05.188
[SPEAKER_10]: and now they've shut down oh it's a bummer to see them go but now it's coming out today did they really shut down or is this all a marketing ploy and that is apparently the latest news that is coming out is that this is actually a marketing ploy about their change from the beta version of GOG.com to the full version of GOG.com

50:06.188 --> 50:25.883
[SPEAKER_10]: And in an article that Kotaku ran, they actually got an update from spokesman Tom Ole Well, he's kind of an a-hole if this whole thing turns out to be true Saying, quote, as the message on the site says, this doesn't mean that GOG is gone We'll have more to share in the coming days

50:26.724 --> 50:27.565
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

50:27.965 --> 50:28.746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of bootsy.

50:28.926 --> 50:29.586
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that.

50:50.262 --> 51:19.317
[SPEAKER_10]: well what's interesting is that now the whole thing might have actually been a media hoax so on one hand you gotta kinda go lol that's funny good job you got the press but on the other hand to your loyal customers who are kinda freaking out about are the games I bought still gonna work how am I gonna re-download these games you know your core fanbase is gonna feel a little bit used after something like this so it's like yes you get the exposure but at what cost I felt very used on Rob's network have you ever bought a game on good old games I didn't think so

51:21.658 --> 51:26.623
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, SpazinatorPSN in our chatroom says, good old games, bad old decisions.

51:27.884 --> 51:29.305
[SPEAKER_10]: And that could be accurate.

51:30.686 --> 51:33.429
[SPEAKER_10]: So... You alright?

51:33.999 --> 51:35.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, nothing happened at all.

51:35.981 --> 51:36.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're good over here.

51:36.982 --> 51:37.662
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, good to hear it.

51:37.942 --> 51:39.784
[SPEAKER_09]: The cord definitely didn't fall out of the microphone.

51:39.824 --> 51:41.365
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, nope, it stayed intact.

51:41.445 --> 51:41.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

51:43.367 --> 51:44.688
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what do you think?

51:44.768 --> 51:50.072
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know you probably weren't a big advocate of this site in the first place, but what do you think about this as a marketing trick?

51:50.173 --> 51:51.113
[SPEAKER_09]: As a marketing trick?

51:52.775 --> 51:57.238
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool that we're all talking about you, and then when you come back, you're like, ah, no, we're not really going away.

51:57.258 --> 51:59.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's like, okay, no, we're not talking about you anymore.

51:59.901 --> 52:00.301
[SPEAKER_09]: No one cares.

52:01.172 --> 52:21.111
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm I think it's in terms of marketing because keep in mind there is no such thing as bad press really yeah it gets people talking here's my suggestion and I know there's a handful of sites out there that listen to our show for inspiration I'm sure not to trash us on their blog every week but here's the thing

52:22.312 --> 52:36.661
[SPEAKER_10]: If you cover the story about them shutting down and you want to really get revenge on these guys and their little marketing tricks and how they're using you basically to get free advertising for their site, cover the story about them shutting down and don't cover the story about them reopening.

52:37.041 --> 52:38.442
[SPEAKER_03]: And then punch them in the dick.

52:39.882 --> 52:41.303
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy will be like, Olay!

52:42.464 --> 52:42.864
[SPEAKER_03]: My dick.

52:42.944 --> 52:43.465
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want.

52:44.685 --> 52:45.506
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, seriously.

52:46.046 --> 52:49.128
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if nobody covers the story about them reopening...

52:50.996 --> 52:53.698
[SPEAKER_10]: This little marketing thing kind of bit him in the ass, didn't it?

52:54.738 --> 52:55.399
[SPEAKER_10]: Food for thought.

52:56.379 --> 53:03.623
[SPEAKER_10]: I know if I ran a website such as the aforementioned Kotaku or Joystick, I just wouldn't run... I would say, you know, I'm not your little...

53:05.416 --> 53:08.357
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not to be toyed with I'm not to be toyed with

53:30.171 --> 53:31.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

53:31.351 --> 53:31.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

53:33.612 --> 53:34.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Rob.

53:34.392 --> 53:35.353
[SPEAKER_03]: Bend over, shark.

53:35.813 --> 53:36.933
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't show your age.

53:37.693 --> 53:39.934
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, please, won't you help us change the subject?

53:40.134 --> 53:42.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are other subjects, definitely.

53:43.075 --> 53:46.776
[SPEAKER_05]: It was spoken, actually, it came up on Twitter.

53:48.417 --> 53:57.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Katsuhiro Harada, who is the Tekken director guy, he posted on Twitter, TGS September 18th at Togeki booth, I'll announce something.

53:58.880 --> 53:59.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Colon D.

54:01.036 --> 54:01.616
[SPEAKER_05]: Smileface.

54:02.817 --> 54:05.758
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually don't know what it is yet.

54:06.438 --> 54:07.939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's second tag tournament two.

54:09.959 --> 54:10.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

54:13.721 --> 54:13.941
[SPEAKER_10]: Yuck.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.598
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you not excited about Tekken Tag Tournament 2?

54:17.778 --> 54:20.200
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't excited about the first Tekken Tag Tournament.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.801
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think that's what it ended up being.

54:22.442 --> 54:23.262
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's right.

54:23.403 --> 54:24.624
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still have to play it.

54:25.084 --> 54:25.925
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's Tekken.

54:26.365 --> 54:26.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

54:28.147 --> 54:34.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, wasn't there like in the 3D Street Fighter series, didn't you not like the first game but the second one was okay?

54:35.093 --> 54:35.493
[SPEAKER_10]: Things like that.

54:35.513 --> 54:36.354
[SPEAKER_21]: And the EX ones?

54:36.394 --> 54:36.634
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

54:38.515 --> 54:39.236
They're alright.

54:40.097 --> 54:42.519
I'm just not a big fan of the Tekken Tag Series.

54:44.693 --> 54:45.614
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa, your mic cut out.

54:45.674 --> 54:47.275
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I didn't even realize we just had big dead air.

54:47.355 --> 54:48.215
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

54:49.216 --> 54:49.476
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

54:49.796 --> 54:50.357
[SPEAKER_10]: So Tekken Tag.

54:50.717 --> 54:51.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Tekken Tag.

54:51.357 --> 54:56.260
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's better than the first one, then yeah, I won't be disappointed.

54:56.320 --> 54:56.780
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.822
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was really not all that great.

54:59.322 --> 55:00.223
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for Tekken Bowl.

55:00.663 --> 55:02.044
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's my thoughts on it.

55:02.264 --> 55:13.531
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably just going to be, since they're developing a tag team tournament sort of engine for Tekken X Capcom, the Namco version of that,

55:14.031 --> 55:15.192
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55:31.099 --> 55:32.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.

55:33.120 --> 55:36.563
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently that game will be hitting Japanese arcades in 2011.

55:37.003 --> 55:50.013
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is an updated, I guess it is a follow-up, of course, to 1999's arcade original, updated with new roster and current-gen graphics engine.

55:50.553 --> 55:52.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't say the U.S.

55:52.395 --> 55:56.378
[SPEAKER_09]: version has been announced yet, but they have a nice little teaser trailer that's up right now.

55:56.618 --> 55:58.139
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you know they're going to have a US version?

55:58.199 --> 56:01.480
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and if this is an arcade game, that's kind of good news, I guess.

56:01.540 --> 56:05.641
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a few stories in the past few weeks about good news for arcade games, you know?

56:06.362 --> 56:12.404
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they're getting some things that the consoles actually don't have just yet, although it's probably inevitable this comes out for consoles as well.

56:13.564 --> 56:17.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope it does, but I would really like to see.

56:18.366 --> 56:21.347
[SPEAKER_05]: If it did get an arcade release in the US, you know I'd play it.

56:22.216 --> 56:29.720
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I don't think if it does come out console-wise, it's not going to take that long to port it over.

56:29.760 --> 56:36.524
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like I said, they're building an engine already for the Tekken X Capcom game.

56:36.784 --> 56:40.026
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Street Fighter, I guess.

56:42.037 --> 56:43.799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be the same damn engine, I know it.

56:44.119 --> 56:48.844
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom, says it actually looks like the same system as Tekken across Capcom.

56:49.304 --> 57:05.300
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, see, that's the sad thing, though, is since they have that game coming out, it's like, you know, I could play that game, but I'd rather play the Capcom one, or not the Capcom, the Street Fighter one, because it's got more variety of characters, and now you have this one.

57:05.620 --> 57:07.723
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope they don't bring it out on console.

57:07.763 --> 57:09.485
[SPEAKER_09]: Just leave it in the arcade or something.

57:09.505 --> 57:12.029
[SPEAKER_09]: But put all the characters though in the Street Fighter one too.

57:12.169 --> 57:12.770
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be kind of cool.

57:13.720 --> 57:19.202
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's travel around the world and talk about some games that are coming out a whole lot sooner than Tekken Tag Tournament.

57:19.323 --> 57:21.764
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, not a whole lot coming out in the U.S.

57:22.064 --> 57:24.165
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually pretty light, but next week will be pretty nice.

57:24.965 --> 57:27.166
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off, though, this week we have Swords on the Wii.

57:27.646 --> 57:28.847
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a sword fighting game.

57:30.227 --> 57:34.589
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like a re-release of a game called Chicken Blaster with a stupid shotgun with that.

57:35.170 --> 57:35.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

57:35.450 --> 57:36.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

57:38.431 --> 57:39.752
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a chicken fighting game?

57:56.502 --> 57:57.103
[SPEAKER_04]: How could you?

57:57.263 --> 57:58.244
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong, sir.

57:58.464 --> 57:58.784
[SPEAKER_04]: You are wrong.

57:58.804 --> 57:59.865
[SPEAKER_10]: You just need Chicken Shooter.

58:00.566 --> 58:01.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicken Blaster, okay.

58:01.967 --> 58:02.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicken Shoot was the first game.

58:03.009 --> 58:04.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Chicken Blaster with your small shotgun.

58:04.350 --> 58:05.971
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it right.

58:06.592 --> 58:09.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Sid Meier's Civilization V coming out on PC.

58:09.955 --> 58:10.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

58:11.677 --> 58:16.061
[SPEAKER_09]: New Carnival games on the DS and the Wii.

58:16.222 --> 58:17.523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

58:18.324 --> 58:18.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like, what was it?

58:22.253 --> 58:50.578
[SPEAKER_09]: WorldGolf2011, that's also on PC, um, Patrician, I think that's, um, Patrician4 on PC, I have no idea what the hell that is, uh, Formula 1 2010, coming from, well, what was formerly Codemasters, now Warner Home Video Games, that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week, uh, let's see,

58:52.118 --> 59:09.679
[SPEAKER_09]: Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue on the DS a tie in with the new movie coming out whoopty shit come on OLR listeners how many of you bought Fancy Nancy last week that's what I want to know ah Sony once again not quite getting it but high velocity bowling for Playstation 3

59:10.700 --> 59:11.700
[SPEAKER_09]: High Velocity Bullying.

59:11.760 --> 59:17.883
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you may remember this as the PlayStation Network title that came out originally at $10, probably now $5.

59:18.843 --> 59:19.503
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, guess what?

59:19.523 --> 59:21.544
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to pay $40 for this one now.

59:21.604 --> 59:22.944
[SPEAKER_10]: But this one has move support, right?

59:23.004 --> 59:24.305
[SPEAKER_09]: It does have move support.

59:24.465 --> 59:27.366
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the old one was getting patched for move support, I think.

59:27.766 --> 59:31.307
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong, but that would be ironic if that was the case.

59:32.228 --> 59:37.309
[SPEAKER_09]: Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allan Poe conspiracy for the DS.

59:37.349 --> 59:37.569
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

59:39.190 --> 59:39.991
[SPEAKER_10]: Farm Frenzy.

59:40.071 --> 59:40.572
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

59:40.672 --> 59:44.216
[SPEAKER_10]: I was about to make the same joke I know I made on this show like four weeks ago.

59:44.276 --> 59:49.761
[SPEAKER_10]: So this game had to have gotten pushed back because I was going to say, I will buy that game, Quoth the Raven, nevermore.

59:50.182 --> 59:50.602
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

59:50.783 --> 59:54.406
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I made that joke four weeks ago and you all groaned then too.

59:54.767 --> 59:55.488
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaving.

59:56.629 --> 01:00:08.681
[SPEAKER_09]: Farm Frenzy, Animal Country Club Penguin, Game Day for the Wii Gormiti, The Lords of Nature Jewels of the Tropical Lost Island

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.912
[SPEAKER_03]: God, this game list is shitty as fuck, man.

01:00:19.932 --> 01:00:25.675
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the great thing, is that Loki, like whenever we do the US release dates, he'll be like, yeah, you know, Halo's coming out this week.

01:00:25.715 --> 01:00:28.597
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have on the DS, Fancy Nancy.

01:00:30.118 --> 01:00:35.121
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks like we've got Jewel Questathon and Chicken Shoots coming out on the Wii.

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:36.782
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but that's my point, though.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:40.544
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been waiting for like two years for like good games to start coming out on the Wii again.

01:00:40.584 --> 01:00:42.525
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm like, okay, Zelda's coming out next year.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:43.265
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:00:43.365 --> 01:00:45.847
[SPEAKER_06]: You can come over and play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom with me.

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:47.490
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's on the Wii.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.510
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I played that.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:49.190
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a fun game.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.031
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Epic Yarn?

01:00:51.671 --> 01:00:52.511
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's not out yet.

01:00:52.571 --> 01:00:53.151
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's what I mean.

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:54.971
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not out yet, and that looks like a good game.

01:00:55.012 --> 01:00:55.272
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

01:00:55.312 --> 01:00:56.852
[SPEAKER_18]: That does not sound like Fancy Nancy.

01:00:56.912 --> 01:00:58.972
[SPEAKER_09]: But before that, Wii Party.

01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:06.674
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that they actually got the idea for the Kirby game from an old Kirby commercial that Nintendo had made using Yarn?

01:01:06.714 --> 01:01:13.815
[SPEAKER_09]: There is some decent stuff coming out this week, and we're also going to end with some crappy stuff, as if we haven't already.

01:01:15.475 --> 01:01:35.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Etrian Odyssey 3 The Drowned City on DS Final Fantasy 14 The Collector's Edition coming out on PC this week I think you get that earlier than the regular version I guess that's special Wait, and how much are you going to pay for Final Fantasy 14 to play it early?

01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:37.666
[SPEAKER_09]: $75 Good lord!

01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:41.008
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money

01:01:42.569 --> 01:01:46.254
[SPEAKER_09]: Also this week, Darksiders on PC.

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:51.214
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that's it.

01:02:13.385 --> 01:02:14.746
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I take a tangent for a minute?

01:02:15.046 --> 01:02:19.248
[SPEAKER_10]: Tangent train, this actually absolutely 100% has nothing to do with video games whatsoever.

01:02:19.988 --> 01:02:21.028
[SPEAKER_10]: But it does have to do with strippers.

01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:22.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes, you can.

01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:30.413
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I went out clubbing last night with Alan and we met some mutual friends and met up for dinner and went to one of the bars downtown.

01:02:30.793 --> 01:02:35.395
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were sitting at a table that is right by the window.

01:02:36.195 --> 01:02:38.498
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can look out onto the street and see what's going on.

01:02:39.138 --> 01:02:39.799
[SPEAKER_10]: And we watched this.

01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:51.551
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a really popular gay bar across the street where all the little circuit boys and all their little women that want to go see the horny guys and stuff.

01:02:51.671 --> 01:02:54.654
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the club they all go to that I outgrew many, many, many years ago.

01:02:54.674 --> 01:02:55.635
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what you're talking about.

01:02:55.655 --> 01:02:56.957
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you know exactly which place I'm talking about.

01:02:56.997 --> 01:02:58.759
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone who lives in Sacramento knows what club I'm talking about.

01:02:59.179 --> 01:03:20.789
[SPEAKER_10]: so we are sitting at the place across the street looking out the window and we see this gigantic bus pull up in front of it and inside the bus is like all these disco lights and like green neon lights going on and we look carefully in the bus there's a stripper pole inside the bus that's awesome and I'm like

01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:22.551
[SPEAKER_10]: What in the hell is that?

01:03:22.691 --> 01:03:27.177
[SPEAKER_10]: And my friend speaks up, I don't remember if it was Alan or my friend, says, oh, it's one of those stripper buses.

01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:29.280
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:31.283
[SPEAKER_10]: They have that now?

01:03:31.343 --> 01:03:35.266
[SPEAKER_10]: They have traveling... Put on your seatbelt!

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.468
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just strap yourself to the pole.

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:38.669
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that work?

01:03:38.709 --> 01:03:40.130
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, it's not a stripper bus.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.050
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a limo bus.

01:03:41.291 --> 01:03:44.073
[SPEAKER_09]: This is funny.

01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:48.636
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, we did our Game Summit thing.

01:03:48.656 --> 01:03:54.401
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the days we went out, they took us to a few wineries and they did wine tasting.

01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:57.124
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they had two different limo buses.

01:03:57.164 --> 01:03:59.326
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a shorter one, and then they had a larger one.

01:03:59.447 --> 01:04:01.669
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the larger one had a stripper pole in the back.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:04.032
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just a bus.

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:06.895
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean... Hold on, hold on.

01:04:06.975 --> 01:04:09.779
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to talk about party bus, we need party bus music.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilliant, I approve.

01:04:14.013 --> 01:04:21.962
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so they do have a stripper pool in the back, and I suppose if you were to rent it, say for a bachelor party or something, you could have strippers performing.

01:04:22.643 --> 01:04:28.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Now granted, it might not be the safest thing for them to be doing, but sure, why not?

01:04:28.846 --> 01:04:44.231
[SPEAKER_10]: So, finally the lights go on in this bus and there's like, I shit you not, like 50 drunk chicks all piled in this bus and it's like the lights went on at the club at 2am and they all just start pouring out the front of the bus and go on in the little gay club.

01:04:44.591 --> 01:04:45.131
Okay.

01:04:47.232 --> 01:04:57.135
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I stopped going to that club also, Rob, because every Friday and Saturday night it's like, let's let all the straights in and there was like two gay people there and I was like, what is going on?

01:04:57.195 --> 01:04:57.415
[SPEAKER_18]: Like...

01:05:06.107 --> 01:05:10.389
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been there in like six years now.

01:05:10.429 --> 01:05:12.590
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but I was just fascinated.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:19.114
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what if that bus, I mean that bus was a big bus and it was taking up an entire lane and surely it doesn't turn well.

01:05:19.494 --> 01:05:22.196
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just thinking like what if that bus gets in an accident?

01:05:22.476 --> 01:05:26.038
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have just drunk chicks pouring out the windshield.

01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:26.898
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

01:05:26.918 --> 01:05:28.539
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:31.461
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't know because they're drunk so it doesn't matter.

01:05:32.641 --> 01:05:37.545
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a terrible thing, having a bunch of drunk chicks inside of a bus with a stripper pole.

01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.267
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeez, that would suck.

01:05:39.887 --> 01:05:43.551
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, and then all the skanky, slutty twink boys that you were nice enough to call the stripper boys.

01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:47.934
[SPEAKER_18]: All the skanky, slutty, snotty twink boys that are faces won't even know because they'll just be like, whatever.

01:05:48.495 --> 01:05:54.260
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how I went out of my way to not give the clubs names and then you're just like... Oh, this is interesting.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.342
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Tiger Call linked us a picture here in chat of a stripper bus.

01:05:58.423 --> 01:05:59.964
[SPEAKER_10]: This must be in Nevada.

01:06:00.104 --> 01:06:02.845
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an advertisement, yeah.

01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:04.926
[SPEAKER_10]: It was close to that, though.

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:06.447
[SPEAKER_10]: It was close to that.

01:06:07.087 --> 01:06:09.648
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looked a little bit more like a regular stripper bus.

01:06:09.688 --> 01:06:10.649
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like a billboard.

01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:12.289
[SPEAKER_03]: A regular stripper bus.

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:17.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's making distinctions between types of buses.

01:06:17.872 --> 01:06:18.132
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

01:06:18.272 --> 01:06:18.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

01:06:19.713 --> 01:06:20.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:06:20.673 --> 01:06:22.454
[SPEAKER_10]: We should go to Japanese release dates, shouldn't we?

01:06:22.474 --> 01:06:46.546
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a stripper pole, that's just a pole so that you don't fall over Yeah, you hold on to it, you know In lieu of a seatbelt, you know Alright, let's go to the Japanese release dates We're gonna make them a little more interesting tonight God's gonna read them in Korean Beep beep, here come your Japanese release dates

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.473
[SPEAKER_10]: Devil May Cry 4 gets a price reduction in Japan September 22nd.

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:57.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Singularity makes its way out to the Xbox 360 in Japan.

01:06:58.675 --> 01:07:03.778
[SPEAKER_10]: That of course being the localized version of the Activision game that I believe came out here a little while ago.

01:07:05.159 --> 01:07:08.000
[SPEAKER_10]: The party keeps on rolling onto the PlayStation 3.

01:07:10.436 --> 01:07:11.057
[SPEAKER_10]: at some point.

01:07:11.638 --> 01:07:13.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, there's a lot of games coming out on the Xbox 360 soon.

01:07:14.101 --> 01:07:19.888
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3 gets Devil May Cry 4, price reduction there as well, and Singularity, as well as winning Post 7 2010.

01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:25.223
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:43.970
[SPEAKER_10]: Jacka Jacka Music Jacka Jacka Music

01:08:07.308 --> 01:08:09.249
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but I'm going to go jack-a-jack all night long.

01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:10.750
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to look at the music.

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:13.652
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's just showing you chords.

01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:17.314
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks really boring, actually.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.175
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd fall asleep playing jack-a-jack music.

01:08:19.215 --> 01:08:21.597
[SPEAKER_21]: False advertising, man.

01:08:21.657 --> 01:08:22.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I get it.

01:08:22.818 --> 01:08:25.639
[SPEAKER_10]: If you jack-a-jack-a before bed, you'll fall asleep easier.

01:08:25.659 --> 01:08:29.021
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

01:08:30.802 --> 01:08:32.303
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a pervert, Rob.

01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:34.805
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the Sony PSP this week...

01:08:43.482 --> 01:08:46.787
[SPEAKER_10]: I shit you not, that's the name of the game.

01:08:47.468 --> 01:08:48.829
[SPEAKER_10]: Three-way standoff.

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:50.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, three-way, eh?

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:57.018
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:08:58.599 --> 01:08:59.740
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's having a moment.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.161
[SPEAKER_21]: Comes out this week.

01:09:01.981 --> 01:09:03.523
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about school kids.

01:09:04.704 --> 01:09:07.186
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's three-way action here.

01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:08.326
[SPEAKER_09]: It always is.

01:09:10.047 --> 01:09:10.427
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Rob.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.428
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so experimental.

01:09:11.868 --> 01:09:14.250
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other PSP games coming out, but I'm done.

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:14.670
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:15.771
[SPEAKER_04]: Do-ra-ra-ra.

01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:16.271
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:18.433
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not done until we... No, I closed it.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:22.515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because I have a good name for you, Rob, for something that comes out on the 22nd.

01:09:23.176 --> 01:09:24.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Death Spank Thongs of Virtue.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:26.858
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like an awesome game.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:28.740
[SPEAKER_10]: For our UK releases.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.861
[SPEAKER_10]: The chatters are pointing out Do-ra-ra-ra is an anime.

01:09:33.108 --> 01:09:58.826
[SPEAKER_05]: About three-way sex amongst school children On the 24th, we have Blue Dragon, Awaken Shadow on the DS Darksiders for PC, Dead Rising 2 Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock Lost Horizon, Quantum Theory I just like that name, Quantum Theory Sid Meier's Civilization V for PC Test Drive Unlimited 2 and Trackmania 2, all for PC

01:10:01.169 --> 01:10:03.491
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, Navy Seals.

01:10:06.472 --> 01:10:06.833
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:10:07.153 --> 01:10:08.614
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we ready to get back into some gaming news?

01:10:08.874 --> 01:10:09.334
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

01:10:09.634 --> 01:10:16.978
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first I'm going to derail the show again because Alan said I have to play this link on air because it has to do with the stripper bus.

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:20.140
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a video from TheOnion.com.

01:10:21.581 --> 01:10:22.222
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

01:10:22.262 --> 01:10:23.442
[SPEAKER_10]: I only know where this is going to go.

01:10:23.882 --> 01:10:25.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this is coming from TheOnion.com.

01:10:27.064 --> 01:10:31.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me stop you real quick, because you did miss one since you didn't want to talk about it.

01:10:31.787 --> 01:10:32.688
[SPEAKER_09]: What did I miss?

01:10:33.468 --> 01:10:39.732
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Ryuga Gotoku Shinshou.

01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:44.555
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the... Oh, great, and now I can't remember the damn title.

01:10:45.855 --> 01:10:49.577
[SPEAKER_09]: The Yakuza on the PSP came out this week as well.

01:10:49.658 --> 01:10:52.019
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little bit of a big title for Japan.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.021
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I talk about the stripper bus again?

01:10:55.061 --> 01:10:56.782
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, talk about the stripper bus.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:02.205
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're just joining us, we are covering a developing story.

01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:11.451
[SPEAKER_14]: We go back now to Southern California where a VH1 bus crashed just a short while ago, spilling more than 2,000 pounds of slut onto interstate five-year Palmdale.

01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:20.636
[SPEAKER_14]: The bus was transporting contestants for the new VH1 reality series, The Road to Knoxville, in which 18 scantily clad young women vie for the heart of divorced stuntman Johnny Knoxville.

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:28.921
[SPEAKER_14]: Officials there are struggling to control the spread of slut, which has already polluted the roadway and is spreading now down a hillside into residential areas.

01:11:29.241 --> 01:11:32.783
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go live to Onion News Network's Brian Scott, who's live on the scene.

01:11:32.803 --> 01:11:34.644
[SPEAKER_14]: Brian, what's exactly going on out there?

01:11:34.684 --> 01:11:36.125
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's just horrible, Anna.

01:11:36.165 --> 01:11:41.709
[SPEAKER_08]: The highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of this orange-skinned slut.

01:11:41.769 --> 01:11:42.789
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only been here an hour.

01:11:43.009 --> 01:11:47.112
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already seen four three-way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings.

01:11:47.532 --> 01:11:52.154
[SPEAKER_08]: and Downwind, the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:53.335
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like quite a scene.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:58.338
[SPEAKER_14]: Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington Beach early this morning, is that right?

01:11:58.378 --> 01:11:59.498
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where it began, yes.

01:11:59.538 --> 01:12:06.862
[SPEAKER_08]: The sluts were being transported from a negligee-wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl-on-girl paintball match when the crash occurred.

01:12:07.242 --> 01:12:14.308
[SPEAKER_08]: In speculation, in fact, the accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on the vehicle and getting on the driver.

01:12:14.348 --> 01:12:18.411
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the local fire department is just not equipped to handle something this toxic.

01:12:18.671 --> 01:12:26.898
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel River and officials are concerned that the sluts might go skinny dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in it.

01:12:26.918 --> 01:12:29.500
[SPEAKER_08]: But we should say, too, that the crews, they're doing their best.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:35.745
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip-offs and shooter contests in the ditch behind me.

01:12:35.845 --> 01:12:38.286
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we've just gotten word that VH1 has issued a statement.

01:12:38.306 --> 01:12:39.086
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on their website.

01:12:39.386 --> 01:12:42.108
[SPEAKER_14]: It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts.

01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:48.790
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but the EPA has urged VH1 to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly concentrated slut they use now.

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:52.032
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1's going to ever go for that.

01:12:52.292 --> 01:12:54.573
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan, stay safe out there, and don't fuck any of those sluts.

01:12:54.653 --> 01:12:55.433
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thanks, Iowa.

01:12:55.473 --> 01:12:59.575
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on, a new Apple laptop has become preloaded with a half-written coming-of-age novel.

01:13:01.095 --> 01:13:02.396
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love The Onion.

01:13:04.376 --> 01:13:09.218
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see the one they did about... You have to understand, that was what we saw last night.

01:13:09.538 --> 01:13:12.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here in Sacramento.

01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:13.059
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Rob, we get it.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:13.940
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.660
[SPEAKER_05]: I love The Onion, too.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:16.361
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, too.

01:13:16.381 --> 01:13:21.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the one about the impending flood from Folsom Dam and then creating the memorial for it?

01:13:22.043 --> 01:13:22.283
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:13:23.583 --> 01:13:26.224
[SPEAKER_05]: and talking to the first person who dies in the flood.

01:13:27.685 --> 01:13:28.626
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, you know what's funny?

01:13:28.706 --> 01:13:32.708
[SPEAKER_10]: Matt and I, the old apartment we lived at, I mean, we can say this now because we don't live there anymore.

01:13:33.068 --> 01:13:35.149
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to live in an apartment, the old studio.

01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:38.750
[SPEAKER_10]: This was the studio from about episodes, what, about 50 to probably like 150?

01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:43.753
[SPEAKER_10]: We're taped at the apartment where Loki and I used to live together, which was right next to Folsom Dam.

01:13:44.133 --> 01:13:45.153
[SPEAKER_10]: We lived in this little apartment complex.

01:13:45.173 --> 01:13:46.534
[SPEAKER_10]: It was literally right next to it.

01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:52.277
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, if that dam ever broke, we'd be looking down on all the people getting flooded out because we were on top of the hill.

01:13:52.657 --> 01:13:54.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, poor people.

01:13:54.218 --> 01:13:56.160
[SPEAKER_05]: Good one, Rob.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.361
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you have so much concern for other people.

01:13:59.622 --> 01:14:00.743
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, video games!

01:14:00.863 --> 01:14:01.264
[SPEAKER_10]: News!

01:14:01.324 --> 01:14:01.984
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:02.965
[SPEAKER_10]: What are those?

01:14:03.045 --> 01:14:03.746
[SPEAKER_10]: Video games.

01:14:04.686 --> 01:14:05.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

01:14:05.167 --> 01:14:05.407
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:14:06.107 --> 01:14:07.268
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about games.

01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:15.655
[SPEAKER_09]: Nielsen, the wonderful agency that talks about different ads and entertainment trends...

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:27.663
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a study of the six EA Sports titles, including NHL 10, NBA Live 09, that had in-game advertisements in them.

01:14:28.003 --> 01:14:35.608
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess, apparently, they increased household dollars spent on different things by 24%.

01:14:37.109 --> 01:14:40.651
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them that they looked at was Gatorade, and that was, I guess, the case there.

01:14:41.872 --> 01:14:42.653
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

01:14:42.813 --> 01:14:43.033
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't...

01:14:45.255 --> 01:14:45.615
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:14:45.635 --> 01:14:52.580
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy that people, you know, if they see Gatorade on a billboard in the background, that they're going to really go and buy Gatorade.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:15:05.271
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of players that play sports games for a long period of time, maybe perhaps like drinking, you know, Gatorade or soda or whatever, and it's just a coincidence, if you ask me.

01:15:06.331 --> 01:15:11.996
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently they have a press release out and summarizing the different things, but...

01:15:13.862 --> 01:15:17.787
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, like, if they cover Axe Body Spray or something like that.

01:15:18.087 --> 01:15:18.868
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be interesting.

01:15:19.168 --> 01:15:28.919
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Nielsen's been running studies on our show here at Orange Lounge Radio, and it's showing that after tonight's episode, it looks like we had an increase.

01:15:29.219 --> 01:15:32.242
[SPEAKER_10]: 33% of our listeners decided to go to Six Flags after tonight's show.

01:15:32.323 --> 01:15:33.444
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something else.

01:15:33.464 --> 01:15:34.165
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something else.

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:39.708
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'll stop.

01:15:41.409 --> 01:15:49.173
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, they said out of, I guess, the panel of 100,000 households representing the U.S.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:53.295
[SPEAKER_09]: population according to their home scan panel or whatever,

01:15:53.775 --> 01:15:57.497
[SPEAKER_09]: It says scanned video game UPC barcodes.

01:15:57.657 --> 01:16:01.780
[SPEAKER_09]: The scanned barcodes were then matched to a reference library of more than 14,000 video games.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:17.669
[SPEAKER_09]: Nielsen compared the households that purchased the least of one of the studied games before and after the Gatorade branding was integrated into the games, the test group, with the households that didn't purchase one of the games, the control group.

01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:20.311
[SPEAKER_09]: It says the test and control groups are projected out abroad

01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:46.549
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah blah, see here it says, well overall they noticed that there was a 24% increase in sales after that So, you know what you just did, you just opened the floodgates for them to like, you know, put in all sorts of ridiculous stuff Way to go Nielsen And trust me, it's gonna get ridiculous as we will get to in part B Oh goody Ridiculously cool though I have to say, so uh

01:16:47.009 --> 01:16:47.350
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:16:48.411 --> 01:16:54.859
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, I think when we do talk about this, this is how you do the advertisement because it's fucking awesome.

01:16:56.281 --> 01:16:57.482
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you got me all curious.

01:16:58.043 --> 01:16:58.383
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:16:59.305 --> 01:17:00.806
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be talking about Sega game.

01:17:01.347 --> 01:17:01.808
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, goody.

01:17:02.298 --> 01:17:03.099
[SPEAKER_10]: KONAMI & HARMONIX

01:17:21.519 --> 01:17:23.440
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a lawsuit launched by Konami.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:30.342
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a filing in a federal court in Texas this week, and the two parties agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims.

01:17:30.822 --> 01:17:40.766
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a suit over Harmonix's Rock Band infringing on patents that were owned by Konami because, of course, Konami had Guitar Freaks many years ago, etc., etc.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.486
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Band supposedly had copies of that.

01:17:43.606 --> 01:17:47.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember they said Rock Revolution failed because of the Rock Band 2 stuff?

01:17:47.908 --> 01:17:49.829
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, among other things.

01:17:49.869 --> 01:17:50.809
[SPEAKER_10]: That was maybe like...

01:17:52.307 --> 01:17:52.767
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there tongue?

01:18:14.296 --> 01:18:16.617
[SPEAKER_09]: We will not know because it's sealed, okay?

01:18:40.163 --> 01:18:41.464
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be playing this game.

01:18:42.125 --> 01:18:44.826
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was your age, I was playing this.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.869
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the classic video game of the week, DarkSakura, what should they be playing?

01:18:49.429 --> 01:18:53.052
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Super Mario Bros.

01:18:53.072 --> 01:18:53.052
2.

01:18:53.672 --> 01:18:53.933
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

01:18:54.673 --> 01:19:02.258
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, I actually have to thank Tiara for suggesting Super Mario Bros., but I wanted to do Super Mario Bros.

01:19:02.278 --> 01:19:02.258
2.

01:19:02.378 --> 01:19:05.561
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually surprised you have never picked this before, but you haven't.

01:19:05.821 --> 01:19:07.022
[SPEAKER_10]: You've done three, but never two.

01:19:08.002 --> 01:19:08.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Bros.

01:19:08.883 --> 01:19:10.385
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 wasn't actually a Super Mario Bros.

01:19:10.405 --> 01:19:11.025
[SPEAKER_05]: game originally.

01:19:11.726 --> 01:19:19.053
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called You May Call Joe Doki Doki Panic, which was also on the Famicom Disk System and had an intro and an ending.

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:21.335
[SPEAKER_10]: But the intro music sounds very familiar.

01:19:21.355 --> 01:19:22.316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:26.425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so cute.

01:19:27.406 --> 01:19:28.968
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, the kids get sucked into a book.

01:19:29.929 --> 01:19:31.230
[SPEAKER_10]: Little monkey boy is running away.

01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:33.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know what the little monkey is about.

01:19:33.413 --> 01:19:34.053
[SPEAKER_05]: He just is there.

01:19:34.494 --> 01:19:37.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, we four people are randomly showing up in these children's bedroom.

01:19:38.178 --> 01:19:39.480
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's jump into the book.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Not creepy at all.

01:19:41.122 --> 01:19:41.162
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:19:42.703 --> 01:19:44.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's flip the disc over.

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.767
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like I said, Famicom disc.

01:19:47.448 --> 01:19:48.950
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, um... What do you want to hear?

01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:50.011
[SPEAKER_10]: Doki Doki Panic music?

01:19:50.311 --> 01:19:51.292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

01:19:51.332 --> 01:19:51.812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

01:19:51.872 --> 01:20:01.522
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, it's funny, some of the sound effects are different, and they did other sprite swaps, like these weird-looking head things were there, but they turned them into mushrooms.

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:10.254
[SPEAKER_09]: and, yeah, this one, um... So you pulled heads out of the grounds instead of, like, you know... No.

01:20:10.294 --> 01:20:11.957
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that'd be really cool.

01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:12.698
[SPEAKER_05]: You pulled the vegetables out.

01:20:12.718 --> 01:20:14.681
[SPEAKER_09]: You pulled severed heads out of the ground instead of vegetables.

01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:18.767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like these masks are sitting there instead of the mushroom blocks.

01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:25.536
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, the whole thought that Nintendo had was that the original Super Mario Bros.

01:20:25.556 --> 01:20:29.241
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 that came out in 1986 was too hard.

01:20:29.761 --> 01:20:31.243
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, American players!

01:20:31.884 --> 01:20:35.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is stupid because Japanese RPGs are ridiculously easy to start off.

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:38.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever play Final Fantasy 7 in Japanese?

01:20:39.393 --> 01:20:40.054
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking easy!

01:20:41.075 --> 01:20:42.797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hit dead, hit dead.

01:20:43.578 --> 01:20:46.963
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is very, very hard, the original Super Mario game.

01:20:47.023 --> 01:20:53.491
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mario, when it came out as lost levels here on the Super Nintendo cartridge, the All-Stars or whatever, it was really hard.

01:20:54.232 --> 01:20:56.495
[SPEAKER_10]: Beat it eventually, but it was a hard game.

01:20:57.757 --> 01:21:09.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um, so what they did is, um, they took, uh, Doki Doki Panic and they, uh, I guess re-sprited it with the main characters and changed a few things.

01:21:09.348 --> 01:21:17.536
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they, because I guess there was more capacity to do stuff on the cartridge, they, um, they actually just, uh,

01:21:18.743 --> 01:21:20.163
[SPEAKER_05]: Could put in some more graphical elements.

01:21:20.283 --> 01:21:28.686
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, one thing that you'll notice listening to the two different tracks is because the sound processor is just a little bit different for the games on disc versus the games.

01:21:29.026 --> 01:21:33.387
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you ever listen to Legend of Zelda on disc from the disc system, the music sounds different.

01:21:34.367 --> 01:21:37.788
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's the same music, but it uses different instrumentation.

01:21:37.808 --> 01:21:38.168
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

01:21:38.668 --> 01:21:39.769
[SPEAKER_05]: And different sound effects.

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:45.070
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the bird thing squawks differently.

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:46.511
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't have the bonus game.

01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:47.851
[SPEAKER_05]: That has a different looking bonus game.

01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:58.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so they did this because they thought it would be more popular and that it would be fun and easy.

01:21:59.322 --> 01:22:08.071
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, it actually came out in Japan in 1992 as Super Mario USA, which came out with Super Mario All-Stars.

01:22:08.332 --> 01:22:09.833
[SPEAKER_05]: So we each got something fun.

01:22:10.994 --> 01:22:19.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but so yeah, you walk around and you throw potions down, which in the original, in the Doki Doki Panic, it's magic lamps.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has sort of this, I guess, Arabian Nights kind of theme in all these other levels.

01:22:26.104 --> 01:22:32.008
[SPEAKER_05]: But you get your power-ups by going into these little reverse universe things and...

01:22:32.808 --> 01:22:49.294
[SPEAKER_05]: In Super Mario 2, of course our US one, you can play as Mario, who is the all-around average dude, or Luigi, who is... I always called him Crazy Legs Dude, because his legs spin, but he jumps higher than anybody else.

01:22:49.995 --> 01:22:52.195
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can play Toad, who, by the way, is not useless.

01:22:52.215 --> 01:22:56.537
[SPEAKER_05]: You play Toad when you need to dig a lot, because he digs faster.

01:22:57.397 --> 01:22:59.058
[SPEAKER_05]: Or when you're trying to get those extra power-ups.

01:22:59.434 --> 01:23:01.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Who was a chick in Doki Doki Panic, right?

01:23:01.274 --> 01:23:01.315
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:23:02.115 --> 01:23:05.416
[SPEAKER_10]: The blue character was a girl, wasn't it?

01:23:05.436 --> 01:23:06.136
[SPEAKER_05]: But that wasn't Toad.

01:23:06.516 --> 01:23:07.056
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Mario.

01:23:07.436 --> 01:23:08.396
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my bad.

01:23:08.796 --> 01:23:09.637
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:23:09.677 --> 01:23:14.778
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got Princess, who is the pink chick with the hair and pants in the Doki Doki Panic.

01:23:15.538 --> 01:23:16.679
[SPEAKER_05]: But she can float, though.

01:23:16.979 --> 01:23:18.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, she can float.

01:23:19.779 --> 01:23:20.860
[SPEAKER_05]: But Toad can't jump for shit.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.461
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you get POW blocks, which blow up things, and they're really fun.

01:23:26.441 --> 01:23:46.606
[SPEAKER_05]: and it had a life meter which was unique for Mario game you know instead of your different sizes but it was really stupid because like if you lose one of your your little segments there then you have to kill like a certain number of enemies so that you can get a heart to come up and then you you know whatever

01:23:47.966 --> 01:23:48.747
[SPEAKER_05]: You will refill it.

01:23:49.587 --> 01:23:50.888
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, to get your star.

01:23:51.468 --> 01:23:56.471
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to thank the irate gamer for this analogy because it was spot on.

01:23:58.112 --> 01:24:02.235
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get like five cherries and then your star will show up for your invincibility.

01:24:02.655 --> 01:24:06.257
[SPEAKER_05]: Except it takes forever to get to where you are unless you're at the very bottom of the screen.

01:24:06.938 --> 01:24:11.440
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way he described it, you have time to take a shit before the star arrives, which he proceeded to do.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.581
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to thank him for demonstrating that.

01:24:14.902 --> 01:24:15.302
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:16.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:24:18.335 --> 01:24:29.546
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, if you pull up the little plants in the little reversed universe, then you get coins, which you can use for a bonus game, which is basically like slots.

01:24:30.527 --> 01:24:35.252
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a pattern to it, and I used to always be able to get the pattern where you'd always get them to match.

01:24:36.293 --> 01:24:40.377
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like if you hit the button really fast, you could usually win it.

01:24:41.038 --> 01:24:42.039
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like...

01:24:44.577 --> 01:24:48.119
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it was like you hit one and then you hit the next two twice as fast.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:52.862
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a da-da-da was my rhythm.

01:24:53.542 --> 01:24:55.783
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always got it.

01:24:56.504 --> 01:24:59.225
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess it depends.

01:25:00.186 --> 01:25:04.749
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if you also hit the button really right away, like after you've gotten a cherry, then you'll always get a cherry on the next one.

01:25:07.153 --> 01:25:09.614
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would have like 50 million lives by the time I was done.

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:17.218
[SPEAKER_05]: You've also got little warp zones where if you throw your little jar at the right spot, it goes down.

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:19.639
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, you got audio issues going on.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.121
[SPEAKER_10]: Were the warp zones in Doki Doki Panic?

01:25:23.101 --> 01:25:23.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they were.

01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:24.341
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:25:25.422 --> 01:25:29.543
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, if you watch the playthrough, because I linked a playthrough for Doki Doki Panic.

01:25:29.563 --> 01:25:31.404
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is all you need to see of Doki Doki Panic, really.

01:25:31.444 --> 01:25:32.664
[SPEAKER_10]: It really wasn't the better game.

01:25:32.764 --> 01:25:38.666
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, a lot of people are like, oh, you know, it was the original, but they made improvements when they brought it over here.

01:25:38.866 --> 01:25:42.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, keep in mind, they had more, if I'm right, they had more storage capacity.

01:25:42.987 --> 01:25:52.409
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that we're missing is the dinky little intro, which you had to flip the disc anyway to start off with, and then flip to play the game, and then flip to go back, and flip and flip and flip, and whatever.

01:25:52.429 --> 01:25:53.269
[SPEAKER_05]: I got tired of flipping off.

01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:56.970
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, all the warps and everything were there.

01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:00.871
[SPEAKER_05]: You just throw them where there's a particular jar, you go down the jar, boom, you're somewhere else.

01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:03.332
[SPEAKER_05]: And I loved this little trick for, was it 6-1?

01:26:03.352 --> 01:26:03.372
[SPEAKER_05]: 6-1.

01:26:04.651 --> 01:26:05.111
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so yeah, uh,

01:26:34.514 --> 01:26:41.444
[SPEAKER_05]: It was... They actually were planning on releasing Doki Doki Panic in the U.S.

01:26:41.484 --> 01:26:44.148
[SPEAKER_05]: at some point, but they actually just didn't.

01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:47.553
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they, you know...

01:26:49.714 --> 01:26:58.559
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing about this though is that the reason why it does kind of fit in musically and with sound effects is because the soundtrack was composed by Koji Kondo.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.160
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:27:01.141 --> 01:27:08.265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting to me like how much this ended up kind of just becoming a part of the Mario mythos, if you will.

01:27:08.305 --> 01:27:16.230
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, later Mario games had some of these characters that first appeared in really Doki Doki Panic kind of crossed over into the Mario universe, especially like some of the

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:17.271
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:27:32.788 --> 01:27:46.822
[SPEAKER_10]: as much as you might want to think Nintendo was kind of rude for dumbing it down it really worked for them it did on multiple levels in this case it was interesting to me though just real quick sorry I know you have more you want to say but it was really interesting to me how this game really fit into the

01:27:47.422 --> 01:27:52.466
[SPEAKER_10]: Very odd 8-bit sequels that were nothing like the originals in many ways.

01:27:52.766 --> 01:27:56.909
[SPEAKER_10]: You had this, you had Castlevania II Simon's Quest, which was a huge departure from the original.

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:59.471
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda II was a huge departure from the original.

01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:04.075
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very interesting how a lot of games were so different back then.

01:28:04.535 --> 01:28:06.157
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this ostrich thing spitting eggs at me?

01:28:06.177 --> 01:28:06.757
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I liked it.

01:28:35.812 --> 01:28:41.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so at any rate, um, we, uh, later on there were the re-releases.

01:28:41.919 --> 01:28:44.703
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Super Mario All-Stars, which was really sweet.

01:28:45.544 --> 01:28:50.329
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, there was, uh, you remember the Satellaview?

01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:55.255
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Gaiden version that was, um, Super Mario All-Stars on Satellaview.

01:28:57.049 --> 01:29:05.081
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was called BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge and so it ran in weekly volumes like all the other Satellaview games.

01:29:06.103 --> 01:29:09.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got Super Mario Advance which was...

01:29:12.099 --> 01:29:13.541
[SPEAKER_05]: The Super Mario Bros.

01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:21.188
[SPEAKER_05]: 2, which actually was a lot harder, but it had some innovations that kept the game fresh, I think, for a lot of people.

01:29:21.509 --> 01:29:22.229
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked it.

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:34.162
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's Super Mario 2, or as the original was, because I think I'd have to lump the games together, is that it was...

01:29:36.058 --> 01:29:37.618
[SPEAKER_05]: and Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

01:29:37.898 --> 01:29:46.940
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, since I'm talking about that too, they did a Mario-style poster based off of the original cover for Doki Doki Panic.

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:56.523
[SPEAKER_10]: And the characters that were in there was... I just want to point out, in the time you've been talking, someone beat Mario 2 here on YouTube.

01:29:56.803 --> 01:29:57.563
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty amazing.

01:29:57.763 --> 01:29:58.483
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I was...

01:30:00.342 --> 01:30:01.383
[SPEAKER_10]: You cut out again.

01:30:01.403 --> 01:30:03.464
[SPEAKER_10]: That mic is getting dated.

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.266
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the mic is new.

01:30:05.326 --> 01:30:06.207
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a new cord.

01:30:07.107 --> 01:30:12.271
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, Imogene was one of the little toad-looking characters.

01:30:12.912 --> 01:30:16.094
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was Mama, who was the one in the blue.

01:30:16.394 --> 01:30:17.075
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Luigi.

01:30:18.116 --> 01:30:22.899
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was Lena, who was the pink princess harem girl.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:27.363
[SPEAKER_05]: And Papa, who became Toad.

01:30:30.074 --> 01:30:36.839
[SPEAKER_05]: And he actually, um... I think became a... No, I'm wrong.

01:30:37.159 --> 01:30:37.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget I said anything.

01:30:37.979 --> 01:30:38.180
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:39.480
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:30:40.521 --> 01:30:42.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now here's the differences.

01:30:42.222 --> 01:30:43.163
[SPEAKER_05]: Different title screen.

01:30:43.984 --> 01:30:47.966
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the story takes place in a storybook instead of in the dream world.

01:30:49.127 --> 01:30:53.810
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have a save feature because it was on the disk system.

01:30:55.251 --> 01:30:57.093
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot run with the B button.

01:30:58.533 --> 01:31:06.578
[SPEAKER_05]: There are, like I said, different music changes, different graphical changes, and you need fewer hits to hit wart in Doki Doki Panic than in Super Mario 2.

01:31:07.178 --> 01:31:18.105
[SPEAKER_05]: The waterfall is faster than in Super Mario 2, and of course different sound effects because of the number of pins between the Famicom disc and the full-size NES cartridges.

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:19.906
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

01:31:21.046 --> 01:31:22.207
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of a split one.

01:31:22.247 --> 01:31:26.750
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Yumi Kojo, Doki Doki Panic, and Super Mario Bros. 2.

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:28.942
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:31:29.523 --> 01:31:34.986
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Mario 2, here in the U.S.

01:31:35.046 --> 01:31:36.347
[SPEAKER_10]: or Doki Doki Panic overseas.

01:31:36.948 --> 01:31:37.368
[SPEAKER_10]: Good pick.

01:31:38.088 --> 01:31:39.409
[SPEAKER_10]: One that I'm sure a lot of people remember.

01:31:40.130 --> 01:31:40.370
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:31:40.730 --> 01:31:43.452
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:31:43.472 --> 01:31:44.312
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be right back.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.374
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty more to come tonight in Part B of our show.

01:31:46.394 --> 01:31:49.035
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually going to get into some more of the news that's coming out of Tokyo Game Show.

01:31:49.055 --> 01:31:50.336
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't do a lot this segment.

01:31:50.636 --> 01:31:51.517
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got plenty more to come.

01:31:51.557 --> 01:31:52.578
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, your calls.

01:31:53.158 --> 01:31:56.262
[SPEAKER_10]: and tweets and emails of which I'm sure there's plenty.

01:31:56.482 --> 01:31:59.185
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get to all those and more Rice Princess and the Doctor.

01:31:59.766 --> 01:32:00.126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

01:32:00.206 --> 01:32:00.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

01:32:00.987 --> 01:32:02.329
[SPEAKER_10]: If I don't kick them off the show.

01:32:02.349 --> 01:32:02.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's going to happen.

01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:06.053
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now they'll be here to tell more poop jokes when we return.

01:32:07.034 --> 01:32:09.037
[SPEAKER_10]: With more of Orange Lodge Radio right after this.

01:32:15.123 --> 01:32:42.092
[SPEAKER_10]: And welcome back everybody to the second half of Orange Lounge Radio Live here at All Games Radio www.allgames.com where we do tape live every Sunday night 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show Going back over to DarkSakura for a minute here because she was talking about something during break that I thought was fascinating You mentioned you were telling Rice Princess about some documentary you've been watching lately It's not a documentary I'm watching a Japanese drama from 2006 called Gal Circle Uh-huh

01:32:42.632 --> 01:32:48.837
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about these girls that are homeless and live in Shinjuku.

01:32:48.877 --> 01:32:50.959
[SPEAKER_05]: They quit school to go be Parapara dancers.

01:32:51.819 --> 01:32:55.882
[SPEAKER_05]: And they hang out in this warehouse and leech free food wherever they can find it.

01:32:57.504 --> 01:32:59.945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cute show, but one of the characters is...

01:33:02.182 --> 01:33:02.783
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

01:33:02.823 --> 01:33:09.410
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I'm listening to something coming from the living room that's like... Dan's watching the Angry Nintendo Nerd.

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:10.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

01:33:10.931 --> 01:33:15.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so... But, like, the whole thing starts off with these U.S.

01:33:15.936 --> 01:33:18.779
[SPEAKER_05]: troops dropping somebody on Shinjuku.

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.283
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's this guy dressed up as a cowboy named Shinosuke.

01:33:23.086 --> 01:33:23.306
[SPEAKER_10]: Outro Music

01:33:37.694 --> 01:33:38.054
[SPEAKER_10]: The part.

01:33:38.134 --> 01:33:39.055
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds amazingly racist.

01:33:39.115 --> 01:33:39.675
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

01:33:39.695 --> 01:33:40.876
[SPEAKER_05]: And this little girl named Momo.

01:33:43.097 --> 01:33:44.638
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all like speaking random English.

01:33:44.698 --> 01:33:45.338
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hilarious.

01:33:45.398 --> 01:33:47.059
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not a documentary.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.740
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a drama-dy?

01:33:49.721 --> 01:33:51.442
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dorama.

01:33:52.122 --> 01:33:52.683
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:33:53.956 --> 01:34:00.538
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like this guy completely knows nothing of Japanese life and he's teaching the girls these lessons through his innocence.

01:34:00.698 --> 01:34:02.859
[SPEAKER_05]: And they teach him the magic of dance.

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:09.601
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the fourth episode now out of 11 and it's pretty funny.

01:34:10.241 --> 01:34:11.662
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I missed this.

01:34:12.482 --> 01:34:13.662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I'll watch more Hoarders.

01:34:14.103 --> 01:34:14.383
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:34:15.943 --> 01:34:18.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, teach me the magic of dance.

01:34:18.244 --> 01:34:18.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

01:34:18.924 --> 01:34:20.184
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, not time for Twitter topics yet.

01:34:20.244 --> 01:34:20.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Be quiet.

01:34:20.805 --> 01:34:21.065
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:34:21.585 --> 01:34:21.845
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

01:34:23.895 --> 01:34:34.543
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at the club the other night and I actually heard a song and the lyrics were and the song is called Commander and the lyrics were tonight I'll be your commander and I command you to dance

01:34:37.217 --> 01:34:38.417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where that came from.

01:34:38.477 --> 01:34:39.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was my Facebook update the other night.

01:34:40.018 --> 01:34:41.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit homosexual.

01:34:41.478 --> 01:34:42.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little.

01:34:42.639 --> 01:34:45.240
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it Commander or Commander?

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:45.720
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Commander.

01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.080
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a Commodore 64.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.301
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it Commander better.

01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:54.422
[SPEAKER_10]: No, when I tell you who it was singing it, that's how you'll know how homosexual it was.

01:34:54.962 --> 01:34:55.323
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

01:34:55.663 --> 01:34:55.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:34:56.103 --> 01:34:56.683
[SPEAKER_10]: Kelly Rowland.

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:34:58.672 --> 01:35:00.253
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the not Beyonce.

01:35:00.774 --> 01:35:01.374
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah.

01:35:01.835 --> 01:35:02.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyonce.

01:35:02.195 --> 01:35:03.616
[SPEAKER_10]: The other chick from Destiny's Child.

01:35:03.757 --> 01:35:03.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:35:04.277 --> 01:35:04.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

01:35:04.777 --> 01:35:06.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it's not Beyonce.

01:35:06.139 --> 01:35:07.160
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, video game news.

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:07.720
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.941
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew we did that on this show?

01:35:09.582 --> 01:35:11.644
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of quick video game news tonight.

01:35:11.684 --> 01:35:12.244
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy hell.

01:35:12.264 --> 01:35:13.525
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of quick news tonight.

01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:18.390
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe Loki has a story starting off about Phantasy Star.

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:23.614
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to say this first because this somehow did not even make our show roll, which is a travesty.

01:35:24.355 --> 01:35:28.658
[SPEAKER_10]: Phantasy Star Online 2 teased in a trailer this week at Tokyo Game Show.

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.038
[SPEAKER_10]: What in the world?

01:35:30.178 --> 01:35:30.739
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

01:35:31.619 --> 01:35:38.243
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's the 10th anniversary of Phantasy Star Online and they have announced that next year they're going to put out Phantasy Star Online 2 for PC.

01:35:39.024 --> 01:35:39.584
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play it.

01:35:40.024 --> 01:35:41.105
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not on console.

01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:42.946
[SPEAKER_10]: That's weird to me that it's not on console.

01:35:42.986 --> 01:35:44.046
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what they're going to do with it.

01:35:44.066 --> 01:35:46.488
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still getting to MMOs on consoles.

01:35:46.528 --> 01:35:53.352
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, at least like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 because so far this generation there's been Final Fantasy XI.

01:35:54.896 --> 01:35:55.557
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't there another one on 360?

01:35:55.597 --> 01:35:57.778
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Fancy Star Universe.

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:02.661
[SPEAKER_09]: But that had more of a single-player component to it, though.

01:36:03.241 --> 01:36:04.262
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't just an MMO.

01:36:04.362 --> 01:36:08.304
[SPEAKER_10]: If those servers shut down, the game would still be playable.

01:36:08.605 --> 01:36:10.005
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a really bad anime.

01:36:10.566 --> 01:36:13.007
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I didn't mean to derail your story, Loki, but I had to throw that out there.

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:18.811
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the break, we were talking about advertisement in games and how it's kind of terrible sometimes.

01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:20.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is how you do it, dammit.

01:36:20.872 --> 01:36:21.573
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, uh...

01:36:22.693 --> 01:36:28.375
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't think of a better way to possibly advertise in a game than how it's done in Phantasy Star Portable 2.

01:36:29.235 --> 01:36:33.917
[SPEAKER_09]: What, may you ask, is actually the case with this?

01:36:34.717 --> 01:36:38.038
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play Colonel Sanders in Phantasy Star Portable 2.

01:36:39.519 --> 01:36:40.299
[SPEAKER_09]: That is awesome.

01:36:40.379 --> 01:36:41.059
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:36:41.219 --> 01:36:42.580
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a playable character?

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.840
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a playable character.

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.441
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the Colonel is there to kick ass.

01:36:47.681 --> 01:37:08.361
[SPEAKER_10]: Back from the dead, with his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices I read some story that like, most kids under 18 don't even know who Colonel Sanders is Oh, but he's gonna come and bitch slap him in the face now Now you'll remember me forever

01:37:09.304 --> 01:37:17.629
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but seriously, they put them in the game, and this isn't a big surprise because actually, I believe it's in the upgraded version of Phantasy Star Portable 2.

01:37:17.849 --> 01:37:19.049
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Infinity, I guess.

01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:26.513
[SPEAKER_09]: And the original Phantasy Star Portable 2 actually had Pizza Hut stuff in there with like a Pizza Hut box shield.

01:37:26.794 --> 01:37:28.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell, you know what that means?

01:37:28.415 --> 01:37:31.056
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming in the next Phantasy Star game is Taco Bell.

01:37:33.057 --> 01:37:33.297
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

01:37:33.317 --> 01:37:34.398
[SPEAKER_10]: Make or run for the PSP.

01:37:35.248 --> 01:37:37.248
[SPEAKER_18]: or the Noid comes back as a playable character.

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:38.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the Noid would be awesome.

01:37:38.969 --> 01:37:43.170
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but if anyone's seen the anime Project Echo, you don't mess with the Colonel.

01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:45.850
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Colonel.

01:37:48.211 --> 01:37:49.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's so ridiculous.

01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:51.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Lee Awesome.

01:37:52.652 --> 01:37:53.232
[SPEAKER_09]: It is awesome.

01:37:53.292 --> 01:38:01.554
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of casting the typical ice firebolt spells, you'll be casting mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.

01:38:02.298 --> 01:38:08.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart Attack, Grease Fire, KFC Bowl, Double Down, the bowl that looks like poop.

01:38:11.501 --> 01:38:11.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:13.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:15.302
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nasty and appropriate.

01:38:15.342 --> 01:38:16.582
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it can't be unseen.

01:38:16.622 --> 01:38:19.843
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they have pictures of him attacking stuff, so I'm trying to see what he...

01:38:20.743 --> 01:38:27.088
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost looks like, and I kid you not, and I don't understand this, but it almost looks like he has a magic wand.

01:38:27.128 --> 01:38:31.410
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he's fucking Harry Potter of the, you know, fast food world or something.

01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:34.913
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's like hitting something.

01:38:34.953 --> 01:38:37.354
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, seriously looking like he's bitch slapping someone right there.

01:38:38.155 --> 01:38:39.476
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all on Famitsu, of course.

01:38:39.836 --> 01:38:43.458
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one more here because it looks like he's throwing a fireball or something.

01:38:44.439 --> 01:38:45.640
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I love the Japanese.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's got like, seriously, he's got like a magical wand.

01:38:48.942 --> 01:38:49.242
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

01:38:50.526 --> 01:38:58.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Colonel Sanders, did you put your name in the goblet of fire?

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:10.261
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, gravy heel, please VidPower says, when are they going to make a fighter featuring the Arby's oven mitt?

01:39:11.182 --> 01:39:14.645
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRDollarBill says, your wand, Sanders, is it made from chicken feather?

01:39:17.012 --> 01:39:43.711
[SPEAKER_09]: I seriously think you know how Burger King does their stupid Burger King games Sneak King was fucking rad which by the way when they do release their Kinect games I'm buying all of them I don't care how terrible they are because they're awesome seriously KFC needs to come up with an original game where it's like oh kids don't know who Colonel Sanders is he's back to kick some fucking ass with his magical wand he's a fucking ninja that's what he is

01:39:44.091 --> 01:39:45.712
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, I'm back from the dead!

01:39:45.852 --> 01:39:46.172
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh!

01:39:46.332 --> 01:39:48.353
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gonna battle Voldemort as well.

01:39:48.633 --> 01:39:50.755
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it bad that your little thing is blinking red?

01:39:51.095 --> 01:39:52.295
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean it's gonna explode?

01:39:52.355 --> 01:39:53.876
[SPEAKER_10]: Nah, it just means the battery's low.

01:39:53.936 --> 01:39:54.417
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:39:55.117 --> 01:39:56.778
[SPEAKER_09]: This means I won't have internet after a while.

01:39:56.798 --> 01:39:57.418
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a little worried.

01:39:57.438 --> 01:39:58.459
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:39:58.519 --> 01:39:59.899
[SPEAKER_09]: It means the time bomb's going off.

01:39:59.919 --> 01:40:01.720
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.982
[SPEAKER_10]: This show will self-destruct in 30 seconds.

01:40:04.062 --> 01:40:05.342
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought Burger King into my house.

01:40:08.223 --> 01:40:08.703
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's alright.

01:40:08.743 --> 01:40:12.045
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I should finish my downloads when I get home because this is so slow.

01:40:12.185 --> 01:40:13.006
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you downloading?

01:40:13.426 --> 01:40:13.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Apps.

01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:16.007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm downloading the two Monkey Island apps.

01:40:17.108 --> 01:40:17.368
[SPEAKER_18]: Sweet.

01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:20.390
[SPEAKER_18]: But I thought that's not like a 4G router?

01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:21.771
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just 3G.

01:40:24.452 --> 01:40:26.314
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I don't know anything about it.

01:40:26.334 --> 01:40:26.994
[SPEAKER_18]: Next story!

01:40:27.995 --> 01:40:31.298
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I'm sorry, it's just so awesome that we have to keep talking about the girl.

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:38.784
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Halo Reach, of course, you know, one of the big things with Halo, and it's kind of become infamous because of it.

01:40:39.565 --> 01:40:47.271
[SPEAKER_09]: The horrible people on Xbox Live, and it's a lot of little kids that really shouldn't be playing... I love when you start off, the horrible people on Xbox Live.

01:40:48.932 --> 01:40:49.393
[SPEAKER_09]: It really...

01:40:50.816 --> 01:40:54.457
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just a bunch of little kids that should have no business playing this game.

01:40:54.937 --> 01:40:56.398
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on there playing this game.

01:40:57.058 --> 01:41:08.862
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you run across some douchebags that are playing the game and being jerks online and you mute them, if enough people mute them, they will just be auto-muted by everybody.

01:41:09.322 --> 01:41:13.503
[SPEAKER_09]: So you won't have to listen to them over a period of time.

01:41:14.103 --> 01:41:16.904
[SPEAKER_18]: But they just like to call people fun, amazing guys.

01:41:18.525 --> 01:41:18.725
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

01:41:22.791 --> 01:41:23.291
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:41:23.872 --> 01:41:25.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I praise your heterosexuality.

01:41:26.954 --> 01:41:27.755
[SPEAKER_03]: We are friends.

01:41:30.757 --> 01:41:32.658
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's available, of course, now.

01:41:33.859 --> 01:41:38.943
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, apparently, who would have thought, the PSP 2 is in the works.

01:41:39.643 --> 01:41:45.568
[SPEAKER_09]: And, in fact, the Mortal Kombat developers have a development unit of it right now.

01:41:45.928 --> 01:41:51.912
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it's a pretty powerful machine and that they will be working on games for it.

01:41:52.012 --> 01:41:57.616
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't even have a 3DS yet, but apparently they have a PSP2.

01:41:57.756 --> 01:42:01.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps the PSP2 will be launching next year soon?

01:42:02.459 --> 01:42:02.719
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe?

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:08.203
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess we'll have to wait and see what they do to enhance stuff on that.

01:42:08.363 --> 01:42:10.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, newsflash of PSP2s in development.

01:42:10.705 --> 01:42:11.285
[SPEAKER_10]: Shocking, huh?

01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:29.085
[SPEAKER_09]: File that next to duh and of course But the news is that they have a unit and that it would probably be close to be releasing Next year's E3 I'm sure it will be next holiday Alongside Shattered Memories 2 The next winner of the E3 game

01:42:30.006 --> 01:42:33.249
[SPEAKER_10]: Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio, three games analysts.

01:42:34.130 --> 01:42:34.610
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes.

01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:35.931
[SPEAKER_10]: Analysts, sorry, analysts.

01:42:36.051 --> 01:42:45.880
[SPEAKER_09]: And Red Faction Armageddon is coming May 2011 next year, and of course that'll be the next big game from the Saints Row developers.

01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:51.404
[SPEAKER_09]: And speaking of Saints Row, they will be putting out a new Saints Row game next fall.

01:42:52.685 --> 01:42:54.527
[SPEAKER_09]: So sad, it's so far away.

01:42:55.967 --> 01:42:56.667
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that game.

01:42:57.348 --> 01:42:57.728
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you do.

01:42:58.269 --> 01:43:00.170
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so terribly awesome.

01:43:00.570 --> 01:43:01.191
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is.

01:43:01.351 --> 01:43:08.956
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something maybe you could play in the meantime would be PopCap World because PopCap and NCSoft have teamed up to bring you PopCap World.

01:43:09.456 --> 01:43:23.706
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh boy, because you have NCSoft who makes those highly addictive Korean MMOs and then some of the ones over here too such as ION and Guild Wars and then PopCap, makers of virtual crack like Peggle, Plants and Zombies and Bejeweled.

01:43:24.406 --> 01:43:28.210
[SPEAKER_10]: PopCap and NCSoft have come together to bring PopCap World.

01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:30.211
[SPEAKER_10]: This platform will be launching later this year.

01:43:30.251 --> 01:43:31.833
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be operated by NCSoft.

01:43:31.873 --> 01:43:34.375
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to feature 13 PopCap titles at launch.

01:43:34.735 --> 01:43:38.819
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be free with optional premium paid elements to be added later.

01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:44.564
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies and an all-new multiplayer game called Super Zuma.

01:43:45.345 --> 01:43:47.205
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the other thing you should know about this.

01:43:47.746 --> 01:43:48.846
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only for Korea.

01:43:49.946 --> 01:43:51.166
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not coming out here.

01:43:51.586 --> 01:43:53.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck did you tell us, Rob?

01:43:53.587 --> 01:43:55.687
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just want you to know what you're missing out on.

01:43:55.987 --> 01:44:00.108
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Zuma, by the way, was, quote, built exclusively for Korean players.

01:44:00.588 --> 01:44:04.729
[SPEAKER_10]: So Super Zuma apparently uses StarCraft characters.

01:44:06.049 --> 01:44:08.130
[SPEAKER_03]: And the screen is very narrow for their eyes.

01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:09.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:10.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I can say it.

01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:11.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Asian.

01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:12.711
[SPEAKER_10]: You can say it.

01:44:12.891 --> 01:44:13.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

01:44:13.652 --> 01:44:14.012
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:17.153
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, that's going to be interesting.

01:44:17.874 --> 01:44:22.356
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised they won't release that here, but maybe Facebook games are doing well enough for them here.

01:44:22.416 --> 01:44:24.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they ever release the Zuma game on Facebook?

01:44:25.237 --> 01:44:25.558
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:44:25.578 --> 01:44:27.019
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did Zoom on Facebook.

01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:28.060
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they were going to.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.304
[SPEAKER_10]: They were going to do Zoom on Facebook and then of course there's Bejeweled.

01:44:31.884 --> 01:44:34.247
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's all about just cross-promoting their iPhone apps.

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:35.108
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they're making money.

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.810
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, do you have Plants vs. Zombies on your new iPod Touch?

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:38.311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

01:44:38.431 --> 01:44:38.932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very fun.

01:44:39.112 --> 01:44:39.572
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome!

01:44:40.593 --> 01:44:43.356
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I played a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies this week for the first time.

01:44:43.436 --> 01:44:46.660
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you believe I've never played that game before and I finally played it this week on Xbox Live?

01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:47.280
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.

01:44:47.321 --> 01:44:48.082
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played it.

01:44:48.322 --> 01:44:49.043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crack rock.

01:44:49.063 --> 01:44:51.686
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've played a zillion and one tower defense games before.

01:44:51.707 --> 01:44:53.048
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, this is another one.

01:44:53.068 --> 01:44:53.789
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's cute.

01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:55.071
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pop crack.

01:44:55.492 --> 01:44:55.852
[SPEAKER_21]: Mm-hmm.

01:44:55.952 --> 01:44:56.273
[SPEAKER_21]: Mm-hmm.

01:44:57.014 --> 01:44:57.414
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

01:44:57.514 --> 01:45:00.937
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of other crack games, some people really love these games.

01:45:01.037 --> 01:45:03.519
[SPEAKER_10]: Muramasa, The Demon Blade, and Odin Sphere.

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, these games are being remade in HD, if rumors are to be believed.

01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:09.684
[SPEAKER_10]: This is only rumor right now.

01:45:10.305 --> 01:45:15.029
[SPEAKER_10]: The re-releases are highly likely for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

01:45:15.369 --> 01:45:16.210
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the giveaway.

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:19.993
[SPEAKER_10]: They're being listed by the Australia Ratings Board as multi-platform.

01:45:20.433 --> 01:45:20.993
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

01:45:21.594 --> 01:45:24.636
[SPEAKER_10]: Odin Sphere, of course, was originally on the PS2, Muramasa on the Wii.

01:45:25.076 --> 01:45:27.657
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of awesome if those games were re-released.

01:45:29.439 --> 01:45:32.821
[SPEAKER_10]: The Last Guardian finally has a release date.

01:45:32.941 --> 01:45:33.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Holiday 2011.

01:45:34.602 --> 01:45:36.963
[SPEAKER_10]: You might remember this was the game they showed, I think, in a trailer.

01:45:37.463 --> 01:45:39.525
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't they show this for the first time, like, last year's E3?

01:45:40.839 --> 01:45:43.101
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but they finally showed it at Tokyo Game Show.

01:45:43.301 --> 01:45:44.241
[SPEAKER_10]: Another trailer.

01:45:45.002 --> 01:45:47.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is the Ico Shadow of the Colossus.

01:45:47.824 --> 01:45:48.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

01:45:48.624 --> 01:45:48.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Holiday 2011.

01:45:49.425 --> 01:45:50.125
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks epic.

01:45:50.185 --> 01:45:50.766
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I gotta say.

01:45:50.826 --> 01:45:51.266
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play it.

01:45:51.326 --> 01:45:54.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has a big, cute, sort of puppy thing.

01:45:54.688 --> 01:45:55.189
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play it.

01:45:55.309 --> 01:45:57.550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a whole little trailer here that was from Tokyo Game Show.

01:45:57.570 --> 01:45:58.451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play a little clip here.

01:45:58.471 --> 01:46:00.012
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to play the whole thing.

01:46:00.032 --> 01:46:01.853
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can see it's loud.

01:46:01.993 --> 01:46:02.694
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

01:46:02.854 --> 01:46:03.894
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched this the other day.

01:46:03.914 --> 01:46:04.255
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.

01:46:04.275 --> 01:46:05.475
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that giant puppy thing.

01:46:05.696 --> 01:46:08.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know what the hell it is, but I'd play the game.

01:46:08.758 --> 01:46:10.499
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's going to crap on that guy.

01:46:11.259 --> 01:46:20.144
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, speaking of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, the collection that's been rumored for the past couple weeks, it's true.

01:46:21.044 --> 01:46:24.386
[SPEAKER_10]: It's HD remakes coming exclusively to the PlayStation 3.

01:46:25.607 --> 01:46:26.727
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also in 3D.

01:46:29.710 --> 01:46:59.052
[SPEAKER_10]: but whatever at least they're 2D as well yeah they're coming to the PlayStation 3 they won't name a release date they're just saying soon but of course the retailers were rumoring April 2011 Sony Computer Entertainment America actually confirmed later spring 2011 so it's coming there's box art and everything and there's a trailer for that as well the game looks sexy as hell and I'm going to admit I didn't really play these games the first time around I watched Loki play one of them

01:46:59.252 --> 01:47:01.353
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a certain unnamed person play them.

01:47:01.573 --> 01:47:01.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:47:01.993 --> 01:47:02.273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:47:02.313 --> 01:47:03.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they hot?

01:47:03.753 --> 01:47:08.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all that Ico is, is this girl making a stupid noise following you.

01:47:09.015 --> 01:47:12.316
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Shadow of the Colossus is like, you're climbing a guy and killing him.

01:47:12.376 --> 01:47:12.656
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:14.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure it would be fun.

01:47:14.197 --> 01:47:17.878
[SPEAKER_03]: You make these sound so stupid, but they're like some of the highest critically acclaimed games.

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:18.958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know.

01:47:18.978 --> 01:47:21.779
[SPEAKER_03]: It was boring to me, but I think if I played it, I'd probably like it better.

01:47:22.898 --> 01:47:25.241
[SPEAKER_10]: Comment from our chat room from Spazinator PSN.

01:47:25.301 --> 01:47:28.646
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that puppy thing remind you of the Luck Dragon from The NeverEnding Story?

01:47:28.927 --> 01:47:29.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Falkor?

01:47:30.208 --> 01:47:32.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah!

01:47:32.231 --> 01:47:32.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinda.

01:47:32.832 --> 01:47:34.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he always sound like he was high?

01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:35.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Falkor?

01:47:35.456 --> 01:47:37.038
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh yeah.

01:47:37.178 --> 01:47:38.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Scratch my ear.

01:47:41.059 --> 01:47:43.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, get me some munchies, could ya?

01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.541
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been laying here for like six hours, really high.

01:47:46.861 --> 01:47:48.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, derailing.

01:47:48.401 --> 01:47:50.602
[SPEAKER_10]: So where, no, it's okay, it happens on this show as well.

01:47:50.942 --> 01:47:53.142
[SPEAKER_10]: So where is Frank West in Dead Rising 2?

01:47:53.582 --> 01:47:57.963
[SPEAKER_10]: He isn't showing up in the game, and you know, Frank West, of course, was the main character in Dead Rising 1.

01:47:58.003 --> 01:47:58.244
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

01:47:58.644 --> 01:47:59.564
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he's been found.

01:47:59.584 --> 01:48:00.424
[SPEAKER_09]: He's covered wars, you know.

01:48:00.744 --> 01:48:00.944
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:48:01.684 --> 01:48:03.185
[SPEAKER_10]: I said he's covered wars, you know.

01:48:03.245 --> 01:48:03.765
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

01:48:04.345 --> 01:48:08.687
[SPEAKER_10]: He's coming to a new game called Dead Rising Case West.

01:48:09.068 --> 01:48:11.629
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, it's an epilogue to Dead Rising 2.

01:48:12.349 --> 01:48:15.751
[SPEAKER_10]: Aha, so Dead Rising Case 0 was the prologue.

01:48:16.091 --> 01:48:18.592
[SPEAKER_10]: Case West will now be the epilogue.

01:48:19.033 --> 01:48:19.333
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it?

01:48:20.113 --> 01:48:23.014
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you've seen photos of the two characters standing next to each other.

01:48:23.075 --> 01:48:24.875
[SPEAKER_10]: Case West is going to be a download title.

01:48:25.136 --> 01:48:27.497
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be exclusive on the Xbox 360.

01:48:27.997 --> 01:48:31.899
[SPEAKER_10]: It will have co-op play where one of you is Chuck and one of you is Frank.

01:48:33.729 --> 01:48:39.192
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to my gay friends, but no word about hot man-on-man action with the Chuck and Frank.

01:48:39.552 --> 01:48:40.633
[SPEAKER_18]: Boo!

01:48:40.893 --> 01:48:41.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Next topic.

01:48:42.434 --> 01:48:43.675
[SPEAKER_03]: No gayness in this one.

01:48:45.295 --> 01:48:49.078
[SPEAKER_18]: On that topic, DarkSakura, you've heard of the Doctor Who game, right?

01:48:49.718 --> 01:48:49.938
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:48:50.118 --> 01:48:55.241
[SPEAKER_18]: And considering now that Russell T. Davies is the head of Doctor Who, do you think there'll be any man-on-man action in the game?

01:48:56.641 --> 01:48:57.742
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Captain Jack in it.

01:48:57.762 --> 01:49:01.285
[SPEAKER_18]: We need Captain Jack and the 50 million gay kisses he has on Torchwood.

01:49:01.886 --> 01:49:02.126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:49:02.486 --> 01:49:03.587
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.

01:49:03.607 --> 01:49:06.329
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you've heard about the new season of Torchwood.

01:49:06.369 --> 01:49:07.690
[SPEAKER_10]: The gay alarm is going off.

01:49:08.331 --> 01:49:09.652
[SPEAKER_10]: This show got too gay.

01:49:09.672 --> 01:49:10.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

01:49:11.073 --> 01:49:11.754
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, John Barrowman.

01:49:11.794 --> 01:49:12.455
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in Rob Network.

01:49:13.555 --> 01:49:14.796
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

01:49:15.276 --> 01:49:20.517
[SPEAKER_10]: We just got an order from the police department of Sacramento to turn down the gayness a little bit, please.

01:49:21.318 --> 01:49:23.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Too late.

01:49:24.459 --> 01:49:25.819
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some other news, Rob?

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:34.582
[SPEAKER_05]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has characters that make me absolutely, absolutely, really, really happy.

01:49:35.262 --> 01:49:35.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Horny?

01:49:37.521 --> 01:49:37.981
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

01:49:38.061 --> 01:49:39.021
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that's what she was going to say.

01:49:39.081 --> 01:49:40.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't going to go there, but all right.

01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:41.742
[SPEAKER_05]: I said happy.

01:49:43.623 --> 01:49:44.943
[SPEAKER_05]: X23 is in the game.

01:49:44.983 --> 01:49:46.163
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me happy.

01:49:46.904 --> 01:49:52.505
[SPEAKER_05]: As in the chick clone of Wolverine, who's actually kind of awesome.

01:49:53.065 --> 01:49:53.405
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot?

01:49:53.725 --> 01:49:54.606
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, hot?

01:49:55.626 --> 01:49:59.227
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if you like... So then you would be a little horny.

01:49:59.447 --> 01:50:00.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

01:50:00.367 --> 01:50:01.668
[SPEAKER_05]: I would bite my butt, Rob.

01:50:02.968 --> 01:50:06.189
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, you know, we also have Tron Bon in there.

01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:25.093
[SPEAKER_05]: and also other characters announced for Street Fighter 4 this is pretty cool is Yun and Yang so pretty cool from Street Fighter 3 I think that's pretty cool they were fun to play and Chun-Li

01:50:26.205 --> 01:50:26.886
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not like Chun-Li.

01:50:27.526 --> 01:50:30.769
[SPEAKER_10]: She's in every fucking Street Fighter game except the very first one.

01:50:31.770 --> 01:50:32.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Fighting Street.

01:50:34.272 --> 01:50:45.081
[SPEAKER_05]: And then IGN found a game-breaking bug in a certain game that we like to complain about sometimes, even though I don't think any of us in here have played it.

01:50:46.242 --> 01:50:48.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Metroid Other M. I just know it's crap.

01:50:48.864 --> 01:50:49.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:50:50.565 --> 01:50:51.086
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D Metroid.

01:50:51.166 --> 01:50:52.887
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not passing judgment until I play it.

01:50:54.088 --> 01:50:57.831
[SPEAKER_18]: And Rice Princess doesn't like any of the 3D Metroid games, so she's biased.

01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:01.153
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't like horseless carriages and metal birds.

01:51:03.215 --> 01:51:03.976
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you?

01:51:04.436 --> 01:51:12.442
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, the bug, if you are in Sector 3 and a certain door stays locked, you'll be locked there forever.

01:51:12.622 --> 01:51:13.243
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just stuck.

01:51:14.424 --> 01:51:15.905
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like there being no boss at level 30.

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:26.683
[SPEAKER_05]: and Nintendo did confirm it and they said that right now the only solutions are to load an earlier save or start over from the beginning.

01:51:27.204 --> 01:51:28.404
[SPEAKER_10]: What a solution!

01:51:29.084 --> 01:51:31.886
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't said anything about fixing it.

01:51:32.346 --> 01:51:34.787
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, duh, stupid, just restart the game.

01:51:35.447 --> 01:51:40.829
[SPEAKER_10]: And the best part is they can't fix it because the Wii doesn't patch games.

01:51:41.469 --> 01:51:45.431
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a potential that they can patch it through a firmware update.

01:51:46.611 --> 01:51:47.052
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't.

01:51:47.592 --> 01:51:47.832
[SPEAKER_09]: Poop.

01:51:49.382 --> 01:51:50.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and good news.

01:51:50.423 --> 01:51:51.303
[SPEAKER_05]: Good happy news.

01:51:52.063 --> 01:51:52.524
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

01:51:52.604 --> 01:51:54.144
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you're going to do.

01:51:54.384 --> 01:51:54.584
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:51:54.624 --> 01:51:54.825
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

01:51:54.905 --> 01:51:55.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanfare.

01:51:55.865 --> 01:51:57.566
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a fanfare.

01:51:57.626 --> 01:51:57.926
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

01:51:58.026 --> 01:52:00.487
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then sing it.

01:52:01.767 --> 01:52:02.427
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Irene.

01:52:02.628 --> 01:52:02.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:52:02.908 --> 01:52:03.248
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

01:52:03.488 --> 01:52:03.808
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

01:52:03.828 --> 01:52:04.788
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting your fanfare music.

01:52:05.309 --> 01:52:06.369
[SPEAKER_03]: But we already did it, Rob.

01:52:06.509 --> 01:52:06.909
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done.

01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:08.770
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to do it anymore.

01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:10.291
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the stamp of Irene on it.

01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:10.611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:52:11.531 --> 01:52:11.811
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

01:52:11.891 --> 01:52:12.751
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's your fanfare.

01:52:14.832 --> 01:52:15.192
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it.

01:52:20.598 --> 01:52:23.239
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best shooting games ever.

01:52:23.859 --> 01:52:25.200
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Treshar goodness.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.300
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say it's Treshar because it's treasure.

01:52:28.801 --> 01:52:29.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun.

01:52:30.141 --> 01:52:32.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

01:52:33.142 --> 01:52:35.423
[SPEAKER_05]: Is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:52:35.843 --> 01:52:36.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

01:52:37.764 --> 01:52:41.625
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be out in 2011 exclusively on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:52:42.106 --> 01:52:45.867
[SPEAKER_05]: It will have updated graphics, online co-op, and an Ikaruga mode.

01:52:47.105 --> 01:52:47.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Icaruga?

01:52:48.206 --> 01:52:48.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

01:52:48.626 --> 01:52:49.226
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always good.

01:53:04.296 --> 01:53:04.616
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

01:53:04.656 --> 01:53:06.278
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a long time ago.

01:53:06.398 --> 01:53:10.561
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time I played Ikaruga was one of the boss fights in Tournament of the Champions.

01:53:10.601 --> 01:53:11.461
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Ikaruga.

01:53:12.042 --> 01:53:12.922
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun.

01:53:13.182 --> 01:53:14.443
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time I played Radiant Silvergun.

01:53:14.804 --> 01:53:15.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:53:16.104 --> 01:53:19.167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I touched a Saturn copy at California Extreme.

01:53:19.387 --> 01:53:19.967
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty.

01:53:20.327 --> 01:53:21.088
[SPEAKER_05]: It was expensive.

01:53:21.168 --> 01:53:22.449
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted like 600 bucks for it.

01:53:22.489 --> 01:53:24.690
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's California Extreme!

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:26.372
[SPEAKER_05]: Extreme!

01:53:26.652 --> 01:53:26.852
Thank you.

01:53:26.872 --> 01:53:27.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Eddie.

01:53:27.292 --> 01:53:28.213
[SPEAKER_10]: Extremely nerdy.

01:53:28.874 --> 01:53:29.575
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

01:53:30.275 --> 01:53:31.596
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Radiant Silvergun!

01:53:32.057 --> 01:53:33.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, we're getting this!

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:35.840
[SPEAKER_10]: He's so excited.

01:53:36.381 --> 01:53:37.362
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Twitter topics?

01:53:37.682 --> 01:53:37.922
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:53:38.042 --> 01:53:38.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:53:40.055 --> 01:53:58.006
[SPEAKER_10]: every week we read your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and I forgot to ask for them tonight so we have very few from tweeters who remember that we do this every week Rob fail that's alright we'll do a few well if you want if you wanted to get in a tweet and you forgot you could hurry up and send an email because I don't think DarkSakura has opened the mail bag yet so you can hurry yes don't

01:53:59.006 --> 01:54:00.306
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

01:54:00.426 --> 01:54:02.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:54:02.887 --> 01:54:04.387
[SPEAKER_10]: PodCulture sent a tweet.

01:54:04.447 --> 01:54:07.207
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually isn't really directly related to the show, but I thought it was interesting.

01:54:07.527 --> 01:54:09.668
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, Sorry gang, not going to make the live feed tonight.

01:54:09.728 --> 01:54:12.148
[SPEAKER_10]: Playing a bit of Phantasy Star Portable 2, then calling it a night.

01:54:12.508 --> 01:54:15.709
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, code required for online multiplayer and PSP 2.

01:54:15.769 --> 01:54:18.529
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it looks like Sega has jumped on board with that whole thing.

01:54:18.929 --> 01:54:19.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:27.731
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Swim sends us a tweet with a story about Microsoft believes that Kinect will blow away iPad sales.

01:54:30.761 --> 01:54:31.242
[SPEAKER_18]: Good luck with that.

01:54:31.302 --> 01:54:33.343
[SPEAKER_18]: In a totally unrelated product comparison.

01:54:34.344 --> 01:54:35.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

01:54:36.886 --> 01:54:38.667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see how that's going to work.

01:54:38.747 --> 01:54:39.888
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas gifts, maybe?

01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.789
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:54:41.970 --> 01:54:45.453
[SPEAKER_09]: I could see that because the Kinect is only $150.

01:54:45.513 --> 01:54:50.557
[SPEAKER_09]: The comments coming from Kudo Shunoda.

01:54:50.577 --> 01:54:52.078
[SPEAKER_09]: And the iPad is way more expensive.

01:54:52.615 --> 01:54:56.356
[SPEAKER_10]: The Xbox 360 is already selling better than the Wii and Sony right now.

01:54:56.396 --> 01:54:58.497
[SPEAKER_10]: Kinect's really just going to boost that to a whole new level.

01:55:16.363 --> 01:55:16.763
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox 360 Launch

01:55:36.821 --> 01:55:38.342
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's kind of a side-related question.

01:55:38.362 --> 01:55:42.663
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you guys think that Xbox actually is not planning on another system in the next couple years?

01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:52.806
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to that in a minute, but first, A, they're going to sell more Kinects than Xbox 360s at launch, because there weren't any fucking Xbox 360s available at launch, remember?

01:55:53.286 --> 01:55:57.868
[SPEAKER_10]: Never forget, there was like no 360s anywhere for like six months.

01:55:58.188 --> 01:55:59.748
[SPEAKER_10]: They were in very limited supplies.

01:56:00.249 --> 01:56:01.629
[SPEAKER_10]: I see what you're doing there, you little...

01:56:03.895 --> 01:56:04.195
[SPEAKER_10]: Liar.

01:56:04.355 --> 01:56:04.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

01:56:28.988 --> 01:56:32.909
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to name the Wii successor and I think that'll kind of be the first in a wave.

01:56:33.309 --> 01:56:36.370
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably Microsoft in about two years will announce their successor too.

01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:43.931
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of updates to current consoles going on is because A, it's all about the digital distribution and upgrades.

01:56:44.371 --> 01:56:49.652
[SPEAKER_10]: B, it's because of the economy and people don't have $400, $500, $600 to jump on a brand new system.

01:56:52.992 --> 01:56:54.072
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:57:13.857 --> 01:57:13.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

01:57:15.898 --> 01:57:16.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Clever!

01:57:17.619 --> 01:57:19.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Well played, Microsoft.

01:57:20.401 --> 01:57:21.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on to you, though.

01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:29.466
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it also has its senses, and if the internal parts are getting too hot, which causes that, it actually shuts the system down before it will red-ring.

01:57:30.046 --> 01:57:30.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wonderful.

01:57:31.247 --> 01:57:32.448
[SPEAKER_18]: That is the worst solution ever.

01:57:34.816 --> 01:57:35.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.

01:57:36.316 --> 01:57:38.477
[SPEAKER_10]: Or as Frisbee in chat calls it, the Xbox 360.

01:57:38.577 --> 01:57:42.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, guffaw, guffaw, guffaw.

01:57:43.778 --> 01:57:44.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good one.

01:57:45.718 --> 01:57:46.538
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing though.

01:57:46.839 --> 01:57:56.821
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be too excited for the next consoles because I'm going to tell you, especially probably from Sony's camp, the next series of consoles, one of them's going to get ballsy and it'll probably be Sony.

01:57:57.261 --> 01:57:58.521
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally digital distribution.

01:57:59.041 --> 01:57:59.441
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait.

01:58:00.381 --> 01:58:01.382
[SPEAKER_10]: All digital distribution.

01:58:01.922 --> 01:58:03.282
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the games better be cheaper.

01:58:04.602 --> 01:58:04.942
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't.

01:58:30.182 --> 01:58:31.802
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claws, send a link.

01:58:31.842 --> 01:58:38.626
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of Apple and apps and stuff, they rejected the onions shoot people point blank in the face game.

01:58:38.646 --> 01:58:39.487
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

01:58:39.607 --> 01:58:39.967
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

01:58:40.007 --> 01:58:41.348
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really too bad.

01:58:41.368 --> 01:58:43.729
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a little trailer here that you can watch.

01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:46.410
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I vanishing?

01:58:46.891 --> 01:58:50.673
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is a whole little... We're about to have a photo of Loki playing.

01:58:50.933 --> 01:58:51.993
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently...

01:58:53.374 --> 01:58:55.796
[SPEAKER_10]: The Onion wrote about a fictional first-person shooter.

01:58:55.836 --> 01:59:00.519
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Close Range, and you just repeatedly shoot people and animals point-blank in the face.

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.641
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, that's a game?

01:59:02.681 --> 01:59:05.663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

01:59:05.703 --> 01:59:07.584
[SPEAKER_18]: You mean that's not every first-person shooter?

01:59:08.645 --> 01:59:17.772
[SPEAKER_13]: Video game fans are lining up today to be the first to purchase Close Range, the hotly anticipated video game in which players repeatedly shoot people point-blank in the face.

01:59:18.192 --> 01:59:20.914
[SPEAKER_13]: Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.

01:59:22.438 --> 01:59:22.998
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Bobby.

01:59:23.058 --> 01:59:27.420
[SPEAKER_07]: Close Range is already being hailed by critics as the most important game of the year.

01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:33.622
[SPEAKER_07]: The first person shooter creates an immersive, richly detailed world where players shoot people in the face with guns.

01:59:33.942 --> 01:59:36.543
[SPEAKER_07]: Reviewers say it brings a new level of depth to gaming.

01:59:36.723 --> 01:59:43.526
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like great literature and film transports you to different worlds, Close Range transports you to a world where you fire bullets into an endless stream of faces.

01:59:43.826 --> 01:59:49.208
[SPEAKER_07]: Fans say it's the game's well-developed characters and storyline that make close range so compelling.

01:59:49.288 --> 01:59:54.210
[SPEAKER_07]: You just feel like you're inside this complex character who's thrust into a world where he has to blow people's heads off.

01:59:54.310 --> 02:00:02.693
[SPEAKER_07]: The plot follows AJ, a man with a mysterious past who must explode hundreds of thousands of human faces on a quest to save his kidnapped brother.

02:00:03.053 --> 02:00:04.074
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?

02:00:04.554 --> 02:00:05.514
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who can help.

02:00:06.895 --> 02:00:08.195
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where your brother is.

02:00:08.475 --> 02:00:09.136
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me.

02:00:09.376 --> 02:00:09.876
[SPEAKER_07]: Look out!

02:00:10.563 --> 02:00:13.585
[SPEAKER_07]: But Closed Range's single-player story is just the beginning.

02:00:14.005 --> 02:00:20.489
[SPEAKER_07]: Its outstanding multiplayer mode offers unparalleled interactivity by allowing players to blast each other's faces off.

02:00:20.609 --> 02:00:21.889
[SPEAKER_07]: It's completely open-ended.

02:00:21.929 --> 02:00:24.971
[SPEAKER_07]: You can shoot someone in the ear, but you can also shoot them in the eye.

02:00:25.171 --> 02:00:29.574
[SPEAKER_07]: With hundreds of hidden extras like side missions where players can take a break from shooting people in the face...

02:00:30.314 --> 02:00:32.515
[SPEAKER_07]: That is horrible.

02:00:33.816 --> 02:00:42.060
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the sequel, Close Range 2, Chainsaw Dawn, continuing the epic story next fall, Close Range fans have even more to look forward to.

02:00:42.761 --> 02:00:44.762
[SPEAKER_07]: For the Onion News Network, I'm Jeff Tate.

02:00:45.422 --> 02:00:48.284
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that was pretty amazing.

02:00:48.344 --> 02:00:51.145
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that probably made for horrible radio, but they really did show...

02:00:52.466 --> 02:00:55.708
[SPEAKER_10]: They really did show people shooting at close range.

02:00:56.209 --> 02:00:58.510
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was a horse and an ostrich.

02:00:58.730 --> 02:00:59.851
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see the difference.

02:00:59.911 --> 02:01:02.453
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that every first person shooter game?

02:01:03.354 --> 02:01:10.098
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, The Onion actually made it a game and submitted close range to sell on the App Store.

02:01:11.119 --> 02:01:13.241
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have bought it.

02:01:13.621 --> 02:01:15.362
[SPEAKER_10]: You know Loki's looking it up right now.

02:01:15.923 --> 02:01:17.344
[SPEAKER_09]: I already saw that news report.

02:01:17.364 --> 02:01:19.285
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll check the jailbreak for us.

02:01:19.385 --> 02:01:21.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Apple rejected it due to violence.

02:01:22.367 --> 02:01:46.532
[SPEAKER_10]: However, The Onion has revised the game and resubmitted it But good luck The iPad and iPhone app stores prohibits apps portraying realistic images of people or animals being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured, or injured That didn't look really realistic That's awesome They must be on lots of crack to have that be their idea of realism

02:01:47.847 --> 02:01:53.815
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, also from Tiger Claw, I know he wants us to know that the SingStar dance track list is out.

02:01:53.855 --> 02:02:00.685
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, because now, thanks to the PlayStation Move, not only do you get to sing, but you get to dance in SingStar.

02:02:01.146 --> 02:02:01.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

02:02:01.546 --> 02:02:04.550
[SPEAKER_10]: Irene's really excited for my next SingStar party, aren't you?

02:02:04.671 --> 02:02:04.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:09.974
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's some of the hits you can do in this new game for Sing Star Dance.

02:02:10.475 --> 02:02:33.790
[SPEAKER_10]: NSYNC, Bye Bye Bye, Blondie, Heart of Glass, Cyndi Lauper, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Gwen Stefani, What You Waitin' For, KC and the Sunshine Band, That's the Way I Like It, LaRue with Bulletproof, Lady Gaga with Poker Face, New Kids on the Block with Hangin' Tough, Paula Abdul with Straight Up, Real to Real with I Like to Move It,

02:02:35.351 --> 02:02:44.740
[SPEAKER_10]: The Backstreet Boys with Everybody Backstreet's Back and Irene's personal favorite The Black Eyed Peas with Shut Up Shut Up!

02:02:44.921 --> 02:02:48.264
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, that's awesome

02:02:49.301 --> 02:02:50.922
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pre-ordering that game, right?

02:02:51.302 --> 02:02:51.603
[SPEAKER_10]: Never.

02:02:52.903 --> 02:02:53.324
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:02:54.364 --> 02:02:55.625
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for the Twitter topic.

02:02:55.645 --> 02:02:57.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those folks that didn't get their tweets read.

02:02:57.827 --> 02:03:00.368
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll just have to tweet us a little faster next time, won't ya?

02:03:00.789 --> 02:03:01.789
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to some gaming news.

02:03:01.909 --> 02:03:07.633
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I hate to tear you away from Plants vs. Zombies, but I'm thinking you might want to read some stories for our listeners.

02:03:07.773 --> 02:03:08.854
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, why not?

02:03:09.094 --> 02:03:10.755
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we can just watch more Onion videos all night.

02:03:10.835 --> 02:03:11.816
[SPEAKER_10]: Onion Lounge Radio, really.

02:03:11.876 --> 02:03:13.037
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, whatever.

02:03:14.297 --> 02:03:42.467
[SPEAKER_09]: EA apparently has not received significant backlash to their online pass remember the online pass is part of their project $10 which is the dumbest name for a project ever and it charges $10 for access to online games or online modes in games if you purchase the game used it says people know that bandwidth isn't free so the fact that we are diffusing online costs isn't seen as unreasonable

02:03:43.667 --> 02:03:46.348
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes no sense, I'll just say.

02:03:47.588 --> 02:03:49.569
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, people aren't complaining enough.

02:03:50.129 --> 02:03:51.369
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a dumb excuse.

02:03:51.389 --> 02:03:54.170
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all, oh, well, bandwidth's not free.

02:03:54.970 --> 02:03:56.151
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

02:03:56.751 --> 02:03:57.651
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it just like that too.

02:03:58.291 --> 02:03:59.932
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandwidth's not free.

02:04:00.452 --> 02:04:01.212
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it more like this.

02:04:01.552 --> 02:04:03.153
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandwidth is not free.

02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:05.400
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

02:04:21.488 --> 02:04:28.778
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you see, they were robbed of the $60 new game that that person might have potentially bought.

02:04:28.798 --> 02:04:31.742
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter, it's still the same amount of people playing online.

02:04:31.882 --> 02:04:38.851
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't have bought because it's $60, they buy used games because they're cheaper, and they probably would have just pirated it.

02:04:39.383 --> 02:04:49.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have to go down to their fucking offices with a basket of apples and show them, okay, if I give you an apple, okay, how many apples do you have?

02:04:49.651 --> 02:04:50.291
[SPEAKER_09]: You have one apple?

02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:55.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, say you sell that apple used back to GameStop, you have now zero apples.

02:04:55.736 --> 02:04:57.057
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think GameStop buys apples.

02:04:58.698 --> 02:04:59.358
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

02:04:59.518 --> 02:05:00.739
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'd like to see you try.

02:05:02.321 --> 02:05:05.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'd like to sell back this apple.

02:05:05.043 --> 02:05:05.423
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:05:07.982 --> 02:05:10.523
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't buy apples.

02:05:10.723 --> 02:05:14.246
[SPEAKER_09]: So EA, I purchased this apple from you for $60.

02:05:15.666 --> 02:05:16.407
[SPEAKER_09]: You have my $60.

02:05:18.328 --> 02:05:20.810
[SPEAKER_09]: I take this apple and give it to my friend Rob.

02:05:22.410 --> 02:05:26.453
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob has not paid you $60, but he'll be using this apple to play online.

02:05:26.913 --> 02:05:31.256
[SPEAKER_09]: I will no longer be playing online with this apple because I don't have an apple anymore.

02:05:31.676 --> 02:05:33.236
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people are playing online with this apple?

02:05:33.256 --> 02:05:33.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

02:05:33.796 --> 02:05:35.557
[SPEAKER_10]: But you said you brought a basket of apples.

02:05:35.777 --> 02:05:38.337
[SPEAKER_10]: So you actually have like 20 more apples sitting in the basket.

02:05:38.417 --> 02:05:38.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

02:05:39.238 --> 02:05:41.278
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've paid for all those copies of the games.

02:05:41.738 --> 02:05:43.698
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see these amazing online apples.

02:05:43.818 --> 02:05:46.539
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to go online and download the apple for free.

02:05:46.979 --> 02:05:48.199
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm going to do.

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:50.040
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes down to it.

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.240
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a dumb excuse.

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:56.301
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be like saying... Let's see here.

02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:22.465
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, I went ahead and made this nice dinner out of food that I purchased from the grocery store However, for you to eat that dinner, you're going to have to pay that grocery store $10 Because they lost out the sales of you purchasing food from the grocery store Despite the fact that they still have the same amount of food in the grocery store Regardless, they've lost no money

02:06:25.194 --> 02:06:25.654
[SPEAKER_09]: I will not.

02:06:26.475 --> 02:06:27.415
[SPEAKER_09]: My voice must be heard.

02:06:27.836 --> 02:06:29.617
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is they're not fighting.

02:06:30.037 --> 02:06:34.099
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically just saying, oh, well, bandwidth costs money.

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.021
[SPEAKER_09]: And gamers are like, oh, okay.

02:06:36.281 --> 02:06:36.921
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense.

02:06:37.862 --> 02:06:41.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of going, wait a second, I paid them for that bandwidth already.

02:06:43.025 --> 02:06:50.990
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeontradio.com, SpazinatorPSN says, that's like a GM complaining that a car dealership sells used cars.

02:06:51.930 --> 02:06:56.033
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, wow, I haven't heard Loki say Apple this much since his latest Mac rant.

02:06:57.314 --> 02:06:59.296
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, Apple Lounge Radio.

02:07:00.677 --> 02:07:05.060
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, Seg says, but I'm sure they sell lemons.

02:07:11.124 --> 02:07:17.449
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my answer to why they haven't seen that much backlash yet as far as the online passing goes.

02:07:17.849 --> 02:07:21.351
[SPEAKER_09]: Because not a lot of people buy EA Sports games used.

02:07:21.712 --> 02:07:26.855
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing that most people buy them brand new when they first come out because they have to have their EA Sports games.

02:07:27.416 --> 02:07:32.740
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure that a lot of people that have bought EA Sports games are probably only buying one or two EA Sports games.

02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:37.643
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody's buying Tiger, NCAA Football, Madden, NHL.

02:07:38.504 --> 02:07:39.444
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's buying everything.

02:07:41.937 --> 02:07:45.600
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to guess that's probably why that no one's bitching about it.

02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:52.825
[SPEAKER_09]: But I bet you anything if this comes out a Medal of Honor or something like that and a bunch of people are buying it used later on, there will be people bitching.

02:07:55.207 --> 02:08:03.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Xam in our chatroom says, Apple's online, the latest fruit-based MMORPG following Fruit Base Fantasy 11 and Papaya Star Online.

02:08:04.314 --> 02:08:09.078
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, see, if you don't speak up, then they're just going to assume that everything is okay.

02:08:09.218 --> 02:08:11.540
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, whatever.

02:08:12.287 --> 02:08:13.128
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried, we tried.

02:08:13.168 --> 02:08:17.472
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, their sales aren't going to hurt at all because, you know, Madden's going to be the top-selling game.

02:08:17.832 --> 02:08:31.225
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, if, you know, EA, say, for example, puts out, I don't know, an MMO version of, like, Lilla's Pet Shop or something like that and charges $10 for online, I'm sure a lot of people won't buy it.

02:08:31.285 --> 02:08:31.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, fuck that.

02:08:31.966 --> 02:08:33.387
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's going to buy that game anyways.

02:08:33.888 --> 02:08:34.868
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I talking about?

02:08:34.888 --> 02:08:35.449
[SPEAKER_09]: Terrible example.

02:08:35.489 --> 02:08:37.391
[SPEAKER_09]: Little girls everywhere want that game.

02:08:38.684 --> 02:08:39.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello Kitty Online

02:08:59.537 --> 02:09:01.958
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, going over to the Kinect in Microsoft.

02:09:01.998 --> 02:09:05.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Some news about the whole camera scanning feature that's going on there.

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:10.582
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember when they first showed Kinect in that whole little Milo demo?

02:09:10.602 --> 02:09:18.025
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed like, ooh, I'm going to draw Milo a picture and put it up on the camera and he's going to show me... That's a wonderful penis you've drawn for me!

02:09:19.085 --> 02:09:20.948
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much was the demo they were showing, right?

02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:28.440
[SPEAKER_10]: But then when they actually showed the games you could play, it was all flail 2000 and dance and wave my hands.

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:32.907
[SPEAKER_10]: And there really was nothing about, oh, it reads paper or any of that stuff, right?

02:09:33.528 --> 02:09:33.888
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:40.513
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, this is still about Milo, have you seen the new Milo demo video that they had out there?

02:09:41.253 --> 02:09:47.397
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what conference it was being shown at, and this isn't a bad joke or anything.

02:09:47.717 --> 02:09:54.321
[SPEAKER_09]: They were actually showing it, apparently he's moved to the US because his family is conflicting or something like that.

02:09:54.721 --> 02:09:55.061
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

02:10:13.015 --> 02:10:14.756
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it's Pedobear the game.

02:10:15.616 --> 02:10:19.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, back to the scanning stuff.

02:10:19.198 --> 02:10:23.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe now's not a good time to talk about Connect Joyride, which is the game I was actually going to talk about.

02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:26.861
[SPEAKER_10]: They were showing off a demo of this at Tokyo Game Show.

02:10:27.641 --> 02:10:35.184
[SPEAKER_10]: Big Park, the developers behind Joyride, which is a Microsoft-owned studio, they actually have worked in some of the camera capture into this game.

02:10:35.604 --> 02:10:36.525
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the weird thing.

02:10:37.285 --> 02:10:41.787
[SPEAKER_10]: What it does, when you do your vehicle customization options, you can pick your car's color.

02:10:42.147 --> 02:10:50.431
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't like the colors in the game, Kinect will look at an item that you put in front of the camera and put its color on the car.

02:10:51.812 --> 02:10:52.832
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

02:10:52.912 --> 02:10:57.455
[SPEAKER_10]: How long until a car that is colored the same color as someone's penis?

02:10:57.515 --> 02:10:58.375
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to know.

02:11:00.436 --> 02:11:01.076
[SPEAKER_10]: Won't take that long.

02:11:01.096 --> 02:11:02.157
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:07.257
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the wonders of modern technology.

02:11:07.337 --> 02:11:08.657
[SPEAKER_10]: It matches colors.

02:11:09.637 --> 02:11:10.078
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

02:11:10.878 --> 02:11:11.458
[SPEAKER_06]: Cocky.

02:11:15.099 --> 02:11:20.620
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, you could also, by the way, capture textures and that whole thing in LittleBigPlanet.

02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:26.422
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, by the way, like, you know, last year or two years ago would already read pictures in front of the PlayStation Eye.

02:11:26.962 --> 02:11:28.263
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually isn't anything new.

02:11:29.083 --> 02:11:29.563
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you know.

02:11:30.339 --> 02:11:30.960
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

02:11:45.416 --> 02:12:12.546
[SPEAKER_05]: To make Wii controllers as part of the Nike 78 project Where they asked 78 artists to be creative with their shoes And so what it does is actually it changes the way a lot of these games are played And I think that he's using Wii Sports Or one of these balance board games And using a chair So he's jumping up and down for doing the little dance thing

02:12:13.966 --> 02:12:18.528
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, but it looks like he can actually do the running in place stuff.

02:12:18.928 --> 02:12:20.828
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like he's having an epileptic seizure.

02:12:20.868 --> 02:12:22.429
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I'm sorry.

02:12:23.429 --> 02:12:28.031
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just waiting for that dog in that one video to come out and push the chair before he sits down.

02:12:28.691 --> 02:12:29.631
[SPEAKER_10]: He falls on his ass.

02:12:29.651 --> 02:12:30.451
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys seen this video?

02:12:30.471 --> 02:12:30.812
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

02:12:31.052 --> 02:12:37.974
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it looks like, though, it totally adds a lot more of a different dimension to the game.

02:12:38.034 --> 02:12:39.414
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, it could be more active.

02:12:40.355 --> 02:12:40.935
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it's Wii Boxing.

02:12:41.817 --> 02:12:43.159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a maniac, maniac That's what it looks like

02:12:59.395 --> 02:13:03.097
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you want to look more ridiculous doing stuff on the Wii, yeah.

02:13:03.677 --> 02:13:10.740
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, when he wasn't using the chair, it did look like he was actually kind of dancing along with the people on the screen instead of just using the balance board, you know?

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:12.160
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it would be fun.

02:13:13.081 --> 02:13:16.162
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just weird that he had to keep sitting on that chair, but you know, whatever.

02:13:16.762 --> 02:13:18.103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like using the bar in DDR.

02:13:18.703 --> 02:13:20.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna judge, not gonna judge.

02:13:20.324 --> 02:13:23.525
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag and the FUs of the Week coming up after just a couple more stories.

02:13:23.979 --> 02:13:24.319
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, apparently there's a new game coming out called Shadows of the Damned.

02:13:31.725 --> 02:13:32.805
[SPEAKER_09]: You said a bad word.

02:13:33.946 --> 02:13:34.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

02:13:36.788 --> 02:13:44.173
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently this is the long-awaited collaboration of Suda51, Akami, and EA.

02:13:44.974 --> 02:13:50.158
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, this new game is going to be a psychological action thriller.

02:13:51.038 --> 02:13:51.198
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

02:13:52.219 --> 02:13:55.081
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some Shadows of the Damned going on in the next room, right?

02:13:55.121 --> 02:14:00.564
[SPEAKER_09]: According to Suda, he and Mikami wanted to make this game for a long time.

02:14:00.604 --> 02:14:03.026
[SPEAKER_09]: He searched for the right publisher to bring it to the audience.

02:14:03.486 --> 02:14:07.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, they said that they can reveal the game they've been working on together with EA.

02:14:07.348 --> 02:14:09.149
[SPEAKER_09]: It's expected to release in 2011.

02:14:09.329 --> 02:14:13.712
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

02:14:13.752 --> 02:14:17.875
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he was working on another game also, which is kind of cool.

02:14:18.135 --> 02:14:21.857
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Akira Yamaoka is doing music for that one, so that's pretty sweet.

02:14:22.901 --> 02:14:23.321
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:14:24.022 --> 02:14:29.285
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, Akira Yamaoka, you know, left Konami, so, and he's supposedly partnering with EA now, so this- Bravo!

02:14:29.385 --> 02:14:30.405
[SPEAKER_09]: Akira Yamaoka.

02:14:31.426 --> 02:14:33.887
[SPEAKER_10]: This is gonna be a heck of a game, but we don't know anything but a title, right?

02:14:33.927 --> 02:14:34.448
[SPEAKER_10]: And a little logo.

02:14:34.468 --> 02:14:35.188
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing right now, yeah.

02:14:35.248 --> 02:14:36.669
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even a screenshot, nothing.

02:14:36.689 --> 02:14:37.149
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

02:14:37.489 --> 02:14:41.492
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be all, like, stick figures and psychological action.

02:14:41.552 --> 02:14:43.813
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll probably be a big thing at E3 next year, I'm imagining.

02:14:44.233 --> 02:14:46.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like Shattered Memories was?

02:14:46.995 --> 02:14:48.817
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a psychological thriller.

02:14:49.077 --> 02:14:51.379
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was also a different developer.

02:14:51.399 --> 02:14:53.500
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it was shit.

02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:57.123
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard your strong feelings about this earlier.

02:14:57.964 --> 02:15:06.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of things that Irene is a big fan of, it was officially announced this week through Mila Jovovich that another Resident Evil movie is definitely coming.

02:15:07.352 --> 02:15:09.813
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean with that, like, open ending?

02:15:09.933 --> 02:15:10.393
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

02:15:11.174 --> 02:15:12.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely you jest.

02:15:13.414 --> 02:15:20.677
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote Mila Jovovich in the New York Magazine, quote, this new Resident Evil is the first one to ever open at number one worldwide.

02:15:20.737 --> 02:15:24.539
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the biggest movie in the franchise, so we're definitely going to make another one.

02:15:25.299 --> 02:15:30.503
[SPEAKER_10]: She's also asking fans to send suggestions for the next film to her Twitter page.

02:15:31.344 --> 02:15:43.793
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to tweet her and tell her some ideas, like make a movie that doesn't suck, you could tweet her at M-I-L-L-A J-O-V-O-V-I-C-H because you don't know how to spell it.

02:15:44.753 --> 02:15:45.074
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:15:46.894 --> 02:15:48.995
[SPEAKER_03]: Suggestion, do not make another movie.

02:15:50.515 --> 02:15:51.075
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:54.636
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to get a Twitter account just to tweet that to her.

02:15:54.697 --> 02:15:56.617
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the last ones, honestly.

02:15:56.677 --> 02:15:58.538
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen the very last one, but I want to.

02:15:58.878 --> 02:16:00.798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't mind the first three movies.

02:16:00.838 --> 02:16:05.200
[SPEAKER_03]: The third one was kind of... But this one was just pretty horrible.

02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:06.700
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

02:16:32.367 --> 02:16:32.607
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

02:16:57.881 --> 02:16:58.444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will.

02:16:59.689 --> 02:17:02.020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this comes from Rini.

02:17:04.264 --> 02:17:05.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings, OLR.

02:17:05.145 --> 02:17:12.589
[SPEAKER_05]: On episode 381, you lamented over Guitar Hero Warrior of Rock's ability to post accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook.

02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:19.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I should mention, Rock Band 3 also has media integration features, but they have a bit of use.

02:17:19.433 --> 02:17:23.035
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you can make a setlist and post it for friends to see or try out.

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.456
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can throttle the frequency of posts.

02:17:25.957 --> 02:17:31.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Another concern with Rock Band 3 is promo DLC, which is going to be separate from standard DLC.

02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:34.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to clarify, this pro DLC is only for guitar and bass.

02:17:35.062 --> 02:17:37.303
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro keys and drums are included in the normal DLC.

02:17:38.003 --> 02:17:39.124
[SPEAKER_05]: There's... Sweet!

02:17:39.504 --> 02:17:52.350
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more interesting details I could just gloss over, but rather than tire poor DarkSakura's windpipes, I'll just link you guys to a few sources to skim over interesting details if you want to bring up such as harmonics, making older DLC compatible with keys in pro mode.

02:17:52.771 --> 02:17:53.771
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, different stuff.

02:17:54.011 --> 02:17:55.052
[SPEAKER_05]: All stuff coming out of packs.

02:17:55.712 --> 02:17:56.994
[SPEAKER_10]: I am really excited.

02:17:57.154 --> 02:18:01.639
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually did not pick up on the fact that Pro Keys was gonna be just included.

02:18:01.679 --> 02:18:02.981
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually makes me really happy.

02:18:04.803 --> 02:18:05.364
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm smiling.

02:18:06.946 --> 02:18:08.828
[SPEAKER_10]: You just can't see it because it's radio, but I'm smiling.

02:18:09.821 --> 02:18:14.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email, hey Orange Lounge Radio, Haseo Sumirogawa here for the third time in this lovely marathon episode.

02:18:15.043 --> 02:18:15.883
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was, yeah, last week.

02:18:15.903 --> 02:18:16.563
[SPEAKER_10]: This must be an old one.

02:18:17.463 --> 02:18:21.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, in an earlier episode I asked about a problem with downloading Bleach Heat The Soul 6.

02:18:22.765 --> 02:18:25.386
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys said be more detailed, so here it is.

02:18:25.526 --> 02:18:28.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Bleach Heat The Soul 6 is a PSP game.

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:30.568
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded it and it was a RAR file.

02:18:32.288 --> 02:18:34.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you downloaded a fake.

02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:41.391
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't help him with that unless he gets into something a little more legitimate.

02:18:41.931 --> 02:18:50.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to pay the extra cost of importing at $60 which is a bit ridiculous considering the extra $20 for next day shipping so they can kiss my butt on that front.

02:18:50.733 --> 02:18:53.914
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually... You can buy, by the way, import PSP games at Fry's.

02:18:54.794 --> 02:18:54.814
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

02:18:57.055 --> 02:18:59.536
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually, I'm going to take shit for this, but I don't care.

02:18:59.576 --> 02:19:00.416
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said it on the show before.

02:19:00.516 --> 02:19:03.377
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not opposed to pirating imported games, actually.

02:19:03.737 --> 02:19:13.219
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think if they are not going to take a chance and release it over here, then why should we pay all this money in import fees to when they're not counting on us for their success anyway?

02:19:13.279 --> 02:19:13.779
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

02:19:14.219 --> 02:19:23.682
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I know that's going to be frowned upon by some people, but I really don't pirate games here in the US, but the import ones, yeah, I have.

02:19:25.223 --> 02:19:26.123
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for reading my email.

02:19:26.143 --> 02:19:27.464
[SPEAKER_05]: Loyal listeners, Sumira Gala.

02:19:27.504 --> 02:19:27.784
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

02:19:27.864 --> 02:19:31.506
[SPEAKER_05]: People are wondering, I got the name from Haseo from .hack//G.U.

02:19:31.546 --> 02:19:31.907
[SPEAKER_05]: series.

02:19:32.367 --> 02:19:34.268
[SPEAKER_05]: Sumira Gala from the Reader Die TV anime.

02:19:34.288 --> 02:19:35.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know it's a woman's last name.

02:19:35.789 --> 02:19:37.110
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really matter whose last name it is.

02:19:37.490 --> 02:19:39.431
[SPEAKER_05]: But F you to all who have a problem with that.

02:19:39.611 --> 02:19:40.212
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again.

02:19:41.112 --> 02:19:44.674
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you can't help me via the radio, please do send a reply.

02:19:46.415 --> 02:19:47.116
[SPEAKER_10]: Forward it to Loki.

02:19:48.797 --> 02:19:49.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki can check the mailbox.

02:19:54.497 --> 02:20:02.443
[SPEAKER_05]: The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report Monday on crime statistics for 2009 that showed a 5.3% drop in violent crimes nationwide and a 4.6% drop in property crimes.

02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:33.106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest that they didn't define the drop context, whether it's per capita or total crimes, but all of these violent games poisoning our minds should turn us into gun-toting, cold-blooded killers.

02:20:33.747 --> 02:20:40.051
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally believe that not just games, but media and software use in general may be indirectly causing the drop.

02:20:40.551 --> 02:20:47.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching TV, playing games, browsing the intertubes, texting on our phones, and other sedentary activities are keeping us inside.

02:20:48.076 --> 02:20:53.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just that, and here's where I get a little controversial, I believe that violence is inversely correlated with average weight.

02:20:55.481 --> 02:20:56.021
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

02:20:56.481 --> 02:20:59.343
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you are overweight, the less mayhem you'll be willing to do.

02:20:59.743 --> 02:21:00.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Fat equals peace.

02:21:00.904 --> 02:21:02.104
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's stretching it.

02:21:02.485 --> 02:21:04.385
[SPEAKER_05]: That's discrimination right there.

02:21:04.466 --> 02:21:05.706
[SPEAKER_05]: Or stretch pantsing it.

02:21:09.168 --> 02:21:12.009
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone slowly step away from Rob.

02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:19.793
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to think if I've ever seen on the news somebody who committed a really horrible crime and if they were fat.

02:21:19.974 --> 02:21:20.414
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm...

02:21:21.781 --> 02:21:26.266
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there's been a few fatties busted.

02:21:26.286 --> 02:21:29.028
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy who shot John Lennon was pretty fat, if I remember right.

02:21:29.949 --> 02:21:31.531
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a really recent story, too.

02:21:32.272 --> 02:21:34.934
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was commenting on the fact that you're like seven pounds, Rob.

02:21:34.974 --> 02:21:36.255
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't saying you're fat, it was the opposite.

02:21:36.396 --> 02:21:37.096
[SPEAKER_18]: Slim Jim over here.

02:21:37.236 --> 02:21:38.117
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Robaba.

02:21:38.578 --> 02:21:39.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, next email.

02:21:42.261 --> 02:21:44.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is from somebody.

02:21:46.041 --> 02:21:49.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, I've been listening to the show for a year now, my first episode being the fuck show.

02:21:51.265 --> 02:21:53.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I have something weird to share with you.

02:21:54.108 --> 02:21:59.793
[SPEAKER_05]: The very day after you guys had Omen in the cage match, DJ Hero posted a clip of it on YouTube.

02:22:00.153 --> 02:22:00.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Coincidence?

02:22:00.834 --> 02:22:02.135
[SPEAKER_05]: I think not, XD.

02:22:02.815 --> 02:22:04.397
[SPEAKER_05]: But one more thing.

02:22:05.882 --> 02:22:10.986
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that song you use at the end of the show every weekend behind the But We're Probably Right Anyway message?

02:22:11.066 --> 02:22:12.246
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find it anywhere, thanks.

02:22:12.387 --> 02:22:14.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's just the Closing Time MIDI.

02:22:14.128 --> 02:22:16.069
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an 8-bit remix of Closing Time.

02:22:16.109 --> 02:22:21.973
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some website, I don't even know where it came from, because it was actually sent to me by a friend, and I was like, hey, we'll make that the closing theme of our show.

02:22:22.614 --> 02:22:23.594
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is from Andy.

02:22:23.934 --> 02:22:27.897
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe some website did a compilation of a bunch of 8-bit versions of songs.

02:22:28.277 --> 02:22:29.818
[SPEAKER_10]: You could probably find it on YouTube.

02:22:29.858 --> 02:22:33.061
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Google YouTube 8-bit Closing Time, you'll find it.

02:22:33.801 --> 02:22:34.622
[SPEAKER_10]: High five, Actdeft, Viva Mexico

02:23:01.417 --> 02:23:07.702
[SPEAKER_05]: My best geek moment was definitely when both of my kids, 6 and 8, actually requested I run a D&D campaign for them.

02:23:08.282 --> 02:23:10.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're playing the Diceless Marvel RPG.

02:23:11.225 --> 02:23:15.148
[SPEAKER_05]: As for anger management moments, my one real fight with my mom was when I was growing up.

02:23:15.268 --> 02:23:20.492
[SPEAKER_05]: At 14, she came into my room and just turned off my SNES because she thought I had had enough video games for the day.

02:23:20.832 --> 02:23:28.538
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I thought differently and actually took her by the shoulders and proceeded to gently but firmly explain as I took her out of my room, locked the door, and turned my console back on again.

02:23:28.938 --> 02:23:30.800
[SPEAKER_05]: She never bothered me with time limits after that.

02:23:31.801 --> 02:23:32.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:23:32.501 --> 02:23:32.822
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

02:23:33.722 --> 02:23:39.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, I've done the math, and considering my OLR cherry was popped somewhere in the to-go era... Is this guy skinny?

02:23:41.730 --> 02:23:42.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me finish.

02:23:42.451 --> 02:23:42.671
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:23:43.071 --> 02:23:44.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Episode number now forgotten.

02:23:44.332 --> 02:23:48.877
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not listed in the wiki, but it was the one where Rob came out of the closet for the audience.

02:23:49.758 --> 02:23:52.460
[SPEAKER_05]: I've now listened to at least 200... Episode one?

02:23:52.861 --> 02:23:53.361
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

02:23:54.282 --> 02:23:54.402
[SPEAKER_05]: I've...

02:23:57.876 --> 02:24:01.160
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the gaydar Rob, just actually saying it.

02:24:02.161 --> 02:24:15.938
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually might have been a while, because I think at the beginning of the show, I actually purposely didn't want to say anything, because not that I was ashamed of it, I'm certainly not, but it's just kind of one of those like, I was like, it's not your business, it doesn't matter, for a while, and then I had to change my heart.

02:24:16.796 --> 02:24:18.618
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to finish this email, sorry.

02:24:19.539 --> 02:24:27.568
[SPEAKER_05]: I've now listened to at least 245 episodes, or if you prefer, 621.5 hours, 2.5 hours a pop of OLR.

02:24:28.208 --> 02:24:35.997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's over 25 days of entertainment from you, so I'll just go ahead and thank you for one of the best months of my life and call it even for the next few episodes, okay?

02:24:37.757 --> 02:24:39.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Gracias, muchas, muchas gracias.

02:24:39.479 --> 02:24:41.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Dr. Noir, a.k.a.

02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:42.561
[SPEAKER_05]: the other Mexican recruit.

02:24:43.122 --> 02:24:43.482
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

02:24:43.802 --> 02:24:52.669
[SPEAKER_05]: This mail has been reviewed by two separate automated spelling and grammar censors and proofread by two young goats which were then sacrificed to the bard in order to keep the dark goddess appeased.

02:24:54.161 --> 02:24:57.043
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, my name is spelled J-A-M-I-E, but thank you for trying.

02:24:58.244 --> 02:24:58.824
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

02:24:59.264 --> 02:25:00.766
[SPEAKER_10]: And people in other countries get a bye.

02:25:01.406 --> 02:25:01.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

02:25:01.966 --> 02:25:02.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

02:25:02.707 --> 02:25:03.768
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to tell you this.

02:25:04.508 --> 02:25:08.471
[SPEAKER_05]: My first name was never misspelled until I moved to California.

02:25:11.253 --> 02:25:11.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

02:25:12.393 --> 02:25:14.575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, people in Alabama can spell my name right.

02:25:16.657 --> 02:25:17.998
[SPEAKER_21]: Next email.

02:25:20.038 --> 02:25:21.359
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is another one from Rababa.

02:25:22.139 --> 02:25:24.700
[SPEAKER_05]: I got what I believe can only be a phishing scam.

02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:30.382
[SPEAKER_05]: I get an email from Spoofed Blizzard inviting me to a beta of the next WoW expansion.

02:25:30.802 --> 02:25:35.444
[SPEAKER_05]: The link is probably to a fake WoW login server because it didn't actually start with a Blizzard or WoW address.

02:25:36.044 --> 02:25:38.685
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I don't even have a WoW account which made it extra fishy.

02:25:39.065 --> 02:25:40.006
[SPEAKER_05]: PSA complete.

02:25:40.746 --> 02:25:47.167
[SPEAKER_05]: I also got to play DarkSakura Sunday because I got nauseous playing Trackmania.

02:25:47.367 --> 02:25:48.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Later, Robbaba.

02:25:48.808 --> 02:25:50.168
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sounds legit to me.

02:25:50.188 --> 02:25:51.548
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know what's funny?

02:25:51.588 --> 02:25:53.909
[SPEAKER_10]: I get emails all the time for Ion Online.

02:25:54.229 --> 02:25:57.470
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, log in and get free gold for Ion Online.

02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:58.750
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I don't even play, dude.

02:25:58.770 --> 02:26:01.950
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I don't have an account, but okay, I'm gonna go do it right now.

02:26:01.970 --> 02:26:03.771
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I have to tell you what Tiara said.

02:26:04.991 --> 02:26:07.212
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got import problems, Robbabil's bad for you, son.

02:26:07.252 --> 02:26:09.172
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got 99 problems, but a pirate ain't one.

02:26:10.976 --> 02:26:12.697
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, happy talk like a pirate day to you too.

02:26:13.478 --> 02:26:20.063
[SPEAKER_10]: R. R. R. R. Derailed.

02:26:20.883 --> 02:26:21.464
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiel Hall.

02:26:22.864 --> 02:26:23.305
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

02:26:24.926 --> 02:26:28.869
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:31.451
[SPEAKER_10]: The futures!

02:26:32.311 --> 02:26:36.034
[SPEAKER_10]: But the present brings the angst and the FUs of the week.

02:26:53.715 --> 02:26:54.195
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

02:26:56.936 --> 02:27:00.178
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Algebra.

02:27:01.919 --> 02:27:04.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.362
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say FU to actually I've got quite a few this week.

02:27:09.542 --> 02:27:12.664
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to Ford for making really shitty cars.

02:27:12.704 --> 02:27:21.628
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had to replace the thermostat housing on my car about three times now because it keeps breaking because it's made of plastic.

02:27:22.208 --> 02:27:51.373
[SPEAKER_09]: and because it gets cracks in it because it oxidizes and that sucks and it's about $300 each time so F you to that F you people that while they're grocery shopping aren't paying attention to where the hell they are and they're totally blocking the aisle they have their card on one side and they're just browsing totally oblivious to the world on the other side or they have like kids running around stuff like that you know so F you to them and people that like to um

02:27:53.402 --> 02:27:56.943
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess participating in idle chit chat in the grocery lines.

02:27:57.043 --> 02:27:57.383
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

02:27:59.664 --> 02:28:03.606
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU of the week, I'm putting this in for Alan, goes to Del Taco.

02:28:04.806 --> 02:28:09.448
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have a good reason because we actually went over to the drive-thru to get him a quick lunch that he could take on the train with him.

02:28:09.788 --> 02:28:15.650
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we sat in the drive-thru for 35 minutes before we finally got our food and he missed his train as a result.

02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:21.416
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to have him here an extra day, but, you know, he had things he wanted to do.

02:28:21.616 --> 02:28:25.240
[SPEAKER_10]: So, kind of irritating when they take a very, very long time.

02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:26.682
[SPEAKER_03]: What was their explanation?

02:28:27.022 --> 02:28:27.863
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't really have one.

02:28:28.484 --> 02:28:28.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

02:28:28.964 --> 02:28:29.725
[SPEAKER_10]: They were just busy.

02:28:30.786 --> 02:28:30.907
Ow.

02:28:31.888 --> 02:28:32.408
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

02:28:32.989 --> 02:28:36.393
[SPEAKER_10]: So, otherwise, F you to the fact I have to get up at 6 in the morning tomorrow.

02:28:37.093 --> 02:28:37.193
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

02:28:38.334 --> 02:28:38.654
[SPEAKER_10]: When?

02:28:39.374 --> 02:28:39.654
[SPEAKER_10]: Sad.

02:28:40.174 --> 02:28:41.715
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any FUs of the week, Rice Princess?

02:28:42.575 --> 02:28:47.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, FU to Everything 3D and FU to Stinky Farts.

02:28:48.997 --> 02:28:49.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

02:28:49.497 --> 02:28:50.257
[SPEAKER_03]: That about covers it.

02:28:51.477 --> 02:28:51.957
[SPEAKER_18]: The Doctor.

02:28:52.557 --> 02:28:54.978
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to 3D as well because I hate 3D forever.

02:28:55.338 --> 02:28:55.778
[SPEAKER_18]: Found it.

02:28:56.558 --> 02:28:57.159
[SPEAKER_18]: Explosion.

02:28:57.559 --> 02:29:01.280
[SPEAKER_18]: And also FU to American TV for not having as many gay kisses as British TV.

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:02.880
[SPEAKER_18]: Bring on the gay kisses, American TV.

02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:06.451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll show you a gay kiss right now.

02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:09.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, they really kissed.

02:29:10.553 --> 02:29:11.173
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it.

02:29:12.594 --> 02:29:14.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, they totally kissed.

02:29:14.515 --> 02:29:14.915
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:29:16.436 --> 02:29:22.259
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Laundry.

02:29:22.279 --> 02:29:23.600
[SPEAKER_10]: I should probably boot Skype, huh?

02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:25.401
[SPEAKER_10]: But not yet because we still got two more stories to go.

02:29:26.297 --> 02:29:37.821
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, who would have thought that D3 would announce that they're releasing Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

02:29:39.122 --> 02:29:42.163
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's wonderful news that I wish I knew earlier.

02:29:43.223 --> 02:29:43.664
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

02:30:01.482 --> 02:30:02.043
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:30:18.098 --> 02:30:18.859
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just fun, though.

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:20.341
[SPEAKER_09]: And this game looks fun, too.

02:30:20.381 --> 02:30:22.664
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to take place now in New Detroit.

02:30:23.124 --> 02:30:24.285
[SPEAKER_09]: The graphics are updated.

02:30:24.666 --> 02:30:30.533
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the screenshot, it looks like we get the jetpack from number two, which is pretty awesome.

02:30:30.613 --> 02:30:32.635
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am very looking forward to this game.

02:30:32.655 --> 02:30:33.837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be coming out in February.

02:30:35.298 --> 02:30:53.796
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says the game is doomed and he actually says doomed it's gonna be awesome I don't care well I had no idea this game was gonna be coming out and I'm really happy that no one seemed to care that Loki you know Loki is saying this for the very first time I mean on this program

02:30:55.230 --> 02:31:01.195
[SPEAKER_10]: One more news story for you guys, and it has to do with a new world record in video games.

02:31:01.635 --> 02:31:03.216
[SPEAKER_10]: And the winner is Mafia 2.

02:31:04.537 --> 02:31:05.017
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

02:31:05.278 --> 02:31:06.859
[SPEAKER_10]: And what did Mafia 2 get?

02:31:07.279 --> 02:31:13.544
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Mafia 2 uses the word fuck more than any other video game.

02:31:13.904 --> 02:31:14.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

02:31:14.724 --> 02:31:15.645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

02:31:15.985 --> 02:31:19.986
[SPEAKER_10]: They won the award for most swearing in a video game.

02:31:20.247 --> 02:31:20.827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

02:31:20.887 --> 02:31:21.747
[SPEAKER_10]: The fuck they did.

02:31:23.228 --> 02:31:29.110
[SPEAKER_10]: House of the Dead Overkill was the previous title that had 189 uses of the word fuck.

02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.610
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:31:30.011 --> 02:31:32.452
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, fuck or fucking or motherfucker.

02:31:32.812 --> 02:31:33.692
[SPEAKER_10]: House of the Dead?

02:31:33.912 --> 02:31:37.794
[SPEAKER_10]: But now, apparently... It's the new Wii game.

02:31:38.094 --> 02:31:39.735
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii game that came out a couple years ago.

02:31:39.855 --> 02:31:40.015
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:31:40.655 --> 02:31:45.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Mafia 2 has more than 200 instances of... Let me interrupt you again, robot.

02:31:45.641 --> 02:31:45.922
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.

02:31:47.484 --> 02:31:48.204
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck did you say?

02:31:48.224 --> 02:31:50.027
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't hear, I was talking.

02:31:51.448 --> 02:31:52.608
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

02:31:52.708 --> 02:31:59.470
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you guys, that's just really immature to say fuck as many times as possible in a short period.

02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:00.670
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really immature.

02:32:00.730 --> 02:32:04.211
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we've never had a fuck show.

02:32:04.291 --> 02:32:04.571
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

02:32:04.611 --> 02:32:11.873
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be extremely fucking immature and we would never do anything like that because we're intelligent gamers.

02:32:12.293 --> 02:32:12.953
[SPEAKER_10]: We're classy.

02:32:13.053 --> 02:32:13.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop saying fuck.

02:32:15.455 --> 02:32:17.196
[SPEAKER_09]: Classy like the Playboys that were in Mafia 2.

02:32:17.577 --> 02:32:19.518
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you give us a call and we'll talk.

02:32:19.538 --> 02:32:23.901
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:24.361 --> 02:32:26.743
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll let Rice Princess answer all the calls tonight.

02:32:26.763 --> 02:32:27.443
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that sound like fun?

02:32:27.463 --> 02:32:28.444
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to answer the calls tonight?

02:32:28.624 --> 02:32:29.025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:32:29.085 --> 02:32:29.425
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

02:32:29.505 --> 02:32:30.886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm classy as fuck.

02:32:30.906 --> 02:32:31.386
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:32:31.947 --> 02:32:34.268
[SPEAKER_10]: Rice Princess is going to answer all the calls for us tonight.

02:32:34.549 --> 02:32:34.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:32:34.829 --> 02:32:40.633
[SPEAKER_10]: So call and talk to Rice Princess at 1-877-GAME-OLR and she will talk to our listeners.

02:32:41.335 --> 02:32:43.476
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't ask me anything stupid.

02:32:44.196 --> 02:32:45.456
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll jump in and help if you need it.

02:32:45.596 --> 02:32:45.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:32:46.096 --> 02:32:47.336
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll answer the stupid questions.

02:32:47.517 --> 02:32:47.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:32:47.837 --> 02:32:49.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Just say, Rob, this is a stupid question.

02:32:49.577 --> 02:32:51.277
[SPEAKER_10]: No, don't make the listeners feel bad.

02:32:51.437 --> 02:32:55.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just give you a signal like, Rob, this is a stupid question?

02:32:56.019 --> 02:32:56.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

02:32:56.819 --> 02:32:57.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:32:57.199 --> 02:32:57.719
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, here we go.

02:32:57.739 --> 02:32:58.499
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a call coming in.

02:32:58.519 --> 02:32:58.779
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready?

02:32:59.179 --> 02:32:59.479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:00.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:02.980
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on OLR person.

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:03.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:05.021
[SPEAKER_17]: Select the Zaku right here.

02:33:05.401 --> 02:33:05.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

02:33:05.901 --> 02:33:05.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

02:33:07.082 --> 02:33:08.163
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know.

02:33:08.303 --> 02:33:11.006
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought Sky was going to be on, but... Oh, sorry.

02:33:11.386 --> 02:33:12.847
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a stupid question, Rob.

02:33:12.867 --> 02:33:13.888
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you should take over.

02:33:13.908 --> 02:33:21.655
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I did IMU within the chat, and I have good reason to be here tonight.

02:33:21.895 --> 02:33:23.477
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, what's your good reason?

02:33:24.157 --> 02:33:29.442
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I actually attended that Halo Reach launch party that Best Buy threw last week, you know, in the city.

02:33:29.943 --> 02:33:31.124
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually got in as VIP.

02:33:32.898 --> 02:33:35.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, how did you get in as VIP, Fancy Pants?

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:38.862
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just say it's through the company I work for.

02:33:39.683 --> 02:33:41.424
[SPEAKER_17]: And they actually do business for Best Buy.

02:33:41.444 --> 02:33:44.827
[SPEAKER_17]: They actually build some of their apps for stuff like Reward Zone.

02:33:44.867 --> 02:33:46.508
[SPEAKER_17]: So you had to give a reach around for reach?

02:33:47.341 --> 02:33:48.442
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I actually got in.

02:33:49.223 --> 02:33:51.024
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually got in through those connections.

02:33:51.064 --> 02:33:56.729
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, pretty much it was just typical fanfare launch party with a lot of people trying to get in VIP.

02:33:57.349 --> 02:34:02.574
[SPEAKER_17]: But most of the folks, all it was is just like playing Halo Reach before midnight.

02:34:02.634 --> 02:34:04.816
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what did the VIP people get?

02:34:04.916 --> 02:34:05.316
[SPEAKER_10]: What made you...

02:34:06.477 --> 02:34:07.998
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I already know.

02:34:08.038 --> 02:34:10.020
[SPEAKER_10]: You're VIP because you listen to this show.

02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.003
[SPEAKER_10]: But what did VIP get that the little peons waiting in line did not get?

02:34:15.063 --> 02:34:16.364
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get the strip bus?

02:34:16.424 --> 02:34:17.505
[SPEAKER_17]: A full-service bar.

02:34:17.565 --> 02:34:19.146
[SPEAKER_17]: We had our own balcony section.

02:34:19.867 --> 02:34:22.509
[SPEAKER_17]: A full-service bar.

02:34:22.909 --> 02:34:23.790
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, exactly.

02:34:25.663 --> 02:34:26.544
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we had a full bar.

02:34:27.264 --> 02:34:28.305
[SPEAKER_10]: So how many people were there?

02:34:28.645 --> 02:34:31.186
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they do that was... Did they have, like, a rock concert?

02:34:31.206 --> 02:34:31.466
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:34:31.486 --> 02:34:31.907
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they do?

02:34:31.967 --> 02:34:32.907
[SPEAKER_10]: A rock concert?

02:34:32.947 --> 02:34:40.852
[SPEAKER_17]: There was one person, I forgot his name, Kid Cudi or something, who was supposed to have played, but he didn't play exactly, you know, before midnight.

02:34:41.232 --> 02:34:45.354
[SPEAKER_17]: But by the time, you know, we left after midnight, he actually got on stage.

02:34:45.374 --> 02:34:54.820
[SPEAKER_17]: There's something about him just, like, being, you know, the unprofessional artist that he... He opened for Lady Gaga once when I saw her, and he's that guy, he just...

02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:56.061
[SPEAKER_12]: Day and Night.

02:34:56.562 --> 02:34:57.383
[SPEAKER_12]: That's him, right?

02:34:57.403 --> 02:34:59.025
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, something like that.

02:34:59.045 --> 02:34:59.666
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

02:34:59.706 --> 02:35:01.068
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, he had the crap song in DJ Hero.

02:35:03.601 --> 02:35:04.602
[SPEAKER_12]: Day and Night

02:35:31.801 --> 02:35:32.521
[SPEAKER_17]: on a Monday night.

02:35:33.102 --> 02:35:33.762
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there strippers?

02:35:35.023 --> 02:35:46.892
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there weren't any strippers, unless you count all the fanboys that were actually donning Halo clothing, such as the plasma swords and whatnot.

02:35:47.212 --> 02:35:49.974
[SPEAKER_10]: How many women were in line for Halo Reach compared to men?

02:35:49.994 --> 02:35:51.696
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a lot of people outside, actually.

02:35:51.796 --> 02:35:53.517
[SPEAKER_17]: It was literally stretching around the block.

02:35:53.537 --> 02:35:53.617
[SPEAKER_17]: He's

02:35:54.397 --> 02:35:57.618
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were outside and not actually in the line waiting to buy the game, right?

02:35:57.638 --> 02:35:58.338
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they were still inside, though.

02:35:58.358 --> 02:36:00.379
[SPEAKER_17]: There were people waiting to get in.

02:36:00.419 --> 02:36:02.599
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the thing.

02:36:02.639 --> 02:36:05.860
[SPEAKER_10]: But you got to sit up on the balcony and just judge them all, right?

02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:07.681
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, because you know what?

02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:09.921
[SPEAKER_17]: I was connected.

02:36:10.321 --> 02:36:11.982
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, I work for the company.

02:36:12.122 --> 02:36:15.183
[SPEAKER_17]: Our company does business with Best Buy, and so they hooked us up.

02:36:15.903 --> 02:36:16.703
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank them for that.

02:36:17.637 --> 02:36:19.759
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me guess, you're talking about U-Beat.

02:36:42.523 --> 02:36:50.011
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, on the iPad, which makes a lot of sense given the fact that it's touch-based and the platform is there.

02:36:50.612 --> 02:37:01.704
[SPEAKER_17]: That means arcade owners, as much as I respect them, they won't have to shell out tons of money for something that may or may not succeed on that medium.

02:37:02.164 --> 02:37:04.667
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:07.750
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good.

02:37:07.770 --> 02:37:14.553
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's a good... Look, I'm more of an Android developer, but even though I have an iPod Touch, I do respect the platform.

02:37:15.454 --> 02:37:18.515
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't like the way they... You know, I don't like Apple's censoring.

02:37:18.655 --> 02:37:21.076
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do you think they'll charge for Ubeat?

02:37:21.256 --> 02:37:21.677
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 cents?

02:37:21.697 --> 02:37:21.677
$4.99?

02:37:22.217 --> 02:37:24.398
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty certain it'll be $5 at most.

02:37:24.418 --> 02:37:24.998
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what they'll do?

02:37:25.018 --> 02:37:28.199
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you it's like 99 cents and then like a dollar a song.

02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:29.360
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, exactly.

02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:30.560
[SPEAKER_17]: Like they're doing with DDRS.

02:37:30.881 --> 02:37:31.221
[SPEAKER_17]: Gross.

02:37:31.974 --> 02:37:36.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but any other thoughts on the Halo Reach party?

02:37:36.959 --> 02:37:41.743
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could sum up the Halo Reach launch party in your VIP access in one word, what would it be?

02:37:42.043 --> 02:37:42.423
[SPEAKER_02]: Sausage.

02:37:45.967 --> 02:37:47.948
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn good time for free.

02:37:48.109 --> 02:37:48.789
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too many words!

02:37:49.390 --> 02:37:49.890
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night.

02:37:50.511 --> 02:37:51.011
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, night.

[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering if you guys had heard about the Fable 3 book that's going to be published Cool, continue No, he asked a question, dummy Cool, continue The Fable 3 book What about it?

02:38:37.293 --> 02:38:40.956

02:38:42.557 --> 02:38:47.822
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's actually not Fable 3 It's going to be taking place between Fable 2 and Fable 3

02:38:54.272 --> 02:39:00.314
[SPEAKER_10]: What's to stop me from going into Barnes & Noble and just copying the code from the book and running home and cashing it in before someone else can?

02:39:01.074 --> 02:39:03.835
[SPEAKER_20]: Rude.

02:39:04.955 --> 02:39:08.516
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they have it in plastic wrap or something and you, I don't know, set off alarms.

02:39:09.017 --> 02:39:11.357
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll set off an alarm if you break the seal.

02:39:11.437 --> 02:39:12.217
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

02:39:12.758 --> 02:39:14.638
[SPEAKER_10]: The Master Chief comes down and blows your head off.

02:39:15.298 --> 02:39:15.999
[SPEAKER_10]: Close range.

02:39:16.659 --> 02:39:17.339
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God.

02:39:19.266 --> 02:39:20.346
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you a big fan of Fable?

02:39:21.206 --> 02:39:22.747
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious about this new game.

02:39:22.807 --> 02:39:27.168
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it didn't seem that different from 2, from what I played, but I heard they really improved co-op.

02:39:28.708 --> 02:39:30.848
[SPEAKER_20]: I am really jealous that you did get to play it.

02:39:32.189 --> 02:39:34.089
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I am a pretty big Fable fan.

02:39:34.649 --> 02:39:45.772
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you, when I played it, Kine, I ran around in a giant chicken suit for like 10 minutes, and I had no idea what I was doing, and I felt like I was playing Furries the game.

02:39:47.012 --> 02:39:47.312
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

02:39:48.939 --> 02:39:51.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, just the one time, just the one time I think it would be funny

02:40:07.543 --> 02:40:09.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, funny and arousing.

02:40:14.247 --> 02:40:21.852
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that there's enough fable mythos out there and enough world that they've constructed out of the games that will make for pretty decent fantasy novels?

02:40:22.052 --> 02:40:25.014
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, it's not like novels for video games is anything too new.

02:40:25.094 --> 02:40:27.055
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Warcraft has a bunch of them.

02:40:27.355 --> 02:40:28.876
[SPEAKER_10]: Even Halo has novels.

02:40:29.056 --> 02:40:29.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil.

02:40:29.716 --> 02:40:30.397
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident Evil.

02:40:30.417 --> 02:40:35.160
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of games, the FX9 novels back in the day, Castlevania, Blaster Master, heck yeah.

02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.621
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

02:40:37.721 --> 02:40:40.703
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there enough substance in Fable to lend itself to books?

02:40:40.884 --> 02:40:41.444
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you think?

02:40:43.065 --> 02:40:43.825
[SPEAKER_20]: There should be.

02:40:45.006 --> 02:40:50.570
[SPEAKER_20]: And besides, they have someone from, I think it was Wizards of the Coast, writing the novel.

02:40:50.610 --> 02:40:53.572
[SPEAKER_20]: The makers of, like, Dungeons and Dragons, I think.

02:40:54.850 --> 02:40:58.691
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and now Irene likes Dungeons & Dragons, so maybe you should get... Why don't you play Fable?

02:40:58.751 --> 02:40:59.571
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually kind of neat.

02:40:59.591 --> 02:41:00.071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:41:00.732 --> 02:41:02.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm too busy playing D&D.

02:41:02.332 --> 02:41:03.712
[SPEAKER_03]: What a good answer!

02:41:04.853 --> 02:41:06.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you put me on the spot, okay, you asshole?

02:41:07.293 --> 02:41:08.414
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we do here on the show.

02:41:08.434 --> 02:41:12.795
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's expensive and not a lot of people have the money to turn off on a $60 game.

02:41:12.955 --> 02:41:14.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what console is it for?

02:41:14.595 --> 02:41:16.916
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for the... It's for the Xbox 360, your favorite.

02:41:17.202 --> 02:41:18.403
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your answer.

02:41:19.944 --> 02:41:20.625
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding, ding, ding.

02:41:20.665 --> 02:41:21.706
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not my fault you're poor.

02:41:22.126 --> 02:41:22.426
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:41:22.446 --> 02:41:23.647
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my fault you're an asshole.

02:41:23.867 --> 02:41:24.368
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:25.388
[SPEAKER_03]: And you smell.

02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:28.511
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what else I want to ask Kaim.

02:41:28.551 --> 02:41:28.891
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:41:29.552 --> 02:41:32.134
[SPEAKER_10]: Quickly, anything else you're looking forward to this holiday season?

02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:45.264
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not looking forward to anything until next year when Metal Gear Rising comes out.

02:41:46.166 --> 02:41:48.207
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, that is going to be a very popular game.

02:41:48.247 --> 02:41:50.948
[SPEAKER_10]: So no interest in the motion control stuff.

02:41:51.028 --> 02:41:52.588
[SPEAKER_10]: No Kinect, no Move in your future?

02:41:54.329 --> 02:42:00.871
[SPEAKER_20]: When they come out with the Kinect feature in Fable 3 where I'm able to growth the other player, sure.

02:42:03.312 --> 02:42:03.692
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:42:04.352 --> 02:42:05.153
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll leave it at that.

02:42:05.253 --> 02:42:06.173
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, Kine.

02:42:06.213 --> 02:42:07.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for the call.

02:42:08.014 --> 02:42:08.594
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you around.

02:42:08.614 --> 02:42:09.334
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you guys.

02:42:10.137 --> 02:42:10.777
[SPEAKER_10]: Later, you too.

02:42:10.837 --> 02:42:11.137
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

02:42:11.717 --> 02:42:12.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

02:42:35.442 --> 02:42:35.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:42:35.822 --> 02:42:42.924
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, wow nerd, the Tauren actually had an ability called Planes Runner in the early days of WoW.

02:42:43.104 --> 02:42:43.865
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

02:42:43.885 --> 02:42:49.506
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, where they could actually be the mounts themselves, but they were patched in with Kodos in a later expansion.

02:42:49.726 --> 02:42:51.247
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't druids kind of like that too?

02:42:51.367 --> 02:42:53.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they can just have their own flying shit?

02:42:54.468 --> 02:42:54.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:42:54.908 --> 02:42:55.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:42:55.108 --> 02:42:56.928
[SPEAKER_10]: How about another call?

02:42:56.968 --> 02:42:57.469
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready, Irene?

02:42:57.669 --> 02:42:58.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:42:59.264 --> 02:42:59.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Ryan!

02:43:01.365 --> 02:43:02.005
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn.

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:03.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

02:43:03.846 --> 02:43:05.087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm booting you from the guild.

02:43:05.947 --> 02:43:06.467
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

02:43:06.867 --> 02:43:08.848
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll GK you quicker than you could me.

02:43:09.568 --> 02:43:11.289
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, in fact, look, I'm on the game right now.

02:43:11.549 --> 02:43:12.490
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:43:12.890 --> 02:43:14.411
[SPEAKER_10]: Radio 101, real quick, Irene.

02:43:14.771 --> 02:43:21.294
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though their name comes up on the screen, you're supposed to, for radio's sake, just play stupid and say, Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:21.334 --> 02:43:21.734
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is this?

02:43:21.834 --> 02:43:24.055
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though you can clearly see his name is Ryan B.,

02:43:25.427 --> 02:43:26.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:43:26.311 --> 02:43:27.736
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds weird on the radio.

02:43:27.756 --> 02:43:29.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, his name is Ryan B?

02:43:29.322 --> 02:43:30.085
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:43:30.105 --> 02:43:30.587
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

02:43:31.129 --> 02:43:31.329
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:43:32.045 --> 02:43:33.746
[SPEAKER_15]: You're giving away personal information there.

02:43:33.786 --> 02:43:35.087
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to give away the whole thing.

02:43:35.447 --> 02:43:36.148
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't say the whole thing.

02:43:36.848 --> 02:43:39.470
[SPEAKER_10]: But take it off your Skype info.

02:43:39.490 --> 02:43:44.594
[SPEAKER_10]: You can all see it in our studio.

02:43:44.974 --> 02:43:46.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Because otherwise you sound like Miss Cleo.

02:43:47.296 --> 02:43:49.897
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because I am Chad.

02:43:49.938 --> 02:43:52.860
[SPEAKER_10]: I already know your name, Chad.

02:43:52.880 --> 02:43:55.621
[SPEAKER_10]: How can I help you today, Ryan?

02:43:56.742 --> 02:43:59.044
[SPEAKER_18]: Another reference that most of your listeners probably don't get, Rob.

02:43:59.762 --> 02:44:00.162
[SPEAKER_18]: It's true.

02:44:00.182 --> 02:44:01.343
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, Miss Cleo, who?

02:44:01.603 --> 02:44:02.224
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, right?

02:44:02.764 --> 02:44:03.004
[SPEAKER_10]: Indeed.

02:44:03.024 --> 02:44:03.344
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

02:44:03.644 --> 02:44:04.305
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, Irene.

02:44:04.425 --> 02:44:04.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

02:44:05.025 --> 02:44:05.846
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want, Ryan?

02:44:06.886 --> 02:44:07.127
[SPEAKER_10]: You.

02:44:09.808 --> 02:44:10.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Gasp.

02:44:11.109 --> 02:44:11.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Drama.

02:44:12.390 --> 02:44:14.971
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what do you really want besides me, everyone?

02:44:15.191 --> 02:44:15.412
[SPEAKER_10]: Me.

02:44:17.473 --> 02:44:18.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the truth right there.

02:44:18.894 --> 02:44:19.354
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, come on.

02:44:19.394 --> 02:44:19.694
[SPEAKER_10]: No, really.

02:44:19.714 --> 02:44:20.955
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want?

02:44:21.135 --> 02:44:21.615
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.

02:44:21.635 --> 02:44:25.818
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just calling in to see how excited you are about Civ V coming out this coming Tuesday.

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:31.779
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I am not excited to spend $50 on a game I'll probably play twice.

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:37.683
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of the stupid WoW and all the stupid time sink I spent on that game.

02:44:38.544 --> 02:44:39.484
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love my guildies.

02:44:40.105 --> 02:44:43.127
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I see how much you've been spending time on my gift for you.

02:44:43.827 --> 02:44:44.567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, right?

02:44:44.968 --> 02:44:46.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how much I've played StarCraft 2?

02:44:46.949 --> 02:44:47.749
[SPEAKER_10]: Not enough.

02:44:47.789 --> 02:44:49.090
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I understand that completely.

02:44:49.571 --> 02:44:50.071
[SPEAKER_10]: Not enough.

02:44:50.231 --> 02:44:52.953
[SPEAKER_16]: Very time consuming, especially with everything coming out now for it.

02:44:52.993 --> 02:44:53.213
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

02:44:53.473 --> 02:45:10.436
[SPEAKER_10]: the bummer with starting a late raiding schedule like our guild did is that like now we don't have that little like usually raiding kind of comes in cycles and the content first comes out you raid it a million times and then it kind of dies off and that's your time to go play other games we haven't had that

02:45:11.456 --> 02:45:32.081
[SPEAKER_16]: so if I want to go play like you know what the word late and raid is all in the same sentence I mean you guys what 8 o'clock your time by the time I get out of it it's about 3.30 in the morning for me not my fault you joined the West Coast Guild alright anyway for the listeners that don't play WoW is there anything else on your mind tonight?

02:45:32.682 --> 02:45:37.225
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the whole, the good old gaming, GOG, that's a whole ruse.

02:45:37.385 --> 02:45:43.269
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll figure that out, come by Wednesday when they announce that they're actually taking their stuff out of beta and actually going live.

02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:48.372
[SPEAKER_16]: There has been reports now that it's claiming that it has been all been one big ruse.

02:45:48.492 --> 02:45:52.154
[SPEAKER_16]: And now they're probably going to pay dearly for what they did to all their paying customers.

02:45:52.294 --> 02:45:53.075
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they dicks or are they dicks?

02:45:53.095 --> 02:45:57.878
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope they have something in store for them because a lot of people are going to still be upset by all that.

02:45:59.389 --> 02:46:00.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to be upset?

02:46:00.290 --> 02:46:01.851
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to boycott their website?

02:46:01.871 --> 02:46:03.253
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm never shopping here again.

02:46:03.793 --> 02:46:04.634
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not really.

02:46:04.654 --> 02:46:06.276
[SPEAKER_16]: I never bought anything from them in the first place.

02:46:06.296 --> 02:46:07.697
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:12.081
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet you, like, half of the games that they have, I already have.

02:46:12.201 --> 02:46:19.388
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, like the Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, all the old games, I'll buy Dirt Keep anyway, so I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

02:46:20.339 --> 02:46:20.679
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

02:46:20.739 --> 02:46:21.820
[SPEAKER_16]: But you know, people are going to.

02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:22.781
[SPEAKER_16]: People are going to be like that.

02:46:22.821 --> 02:46:24.482
[SPEAKER_16]: People are going to be like, why did you pull this on us?

02:46:24.682 --> 02:46:26.163
[SPEAKER_16]: We thought you were being for real.

02:46:26.183 --> 02:46:30.145
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of people didn't know what was really going on and now you do this.

02:46:30.245 --> 02:46:32.247
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's like, well, you know, screw you.

02:46:32.307 --> 02:46:35.929
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll find another place to buy the game or torrent or whatever, so.

02:46:36.913 --> 02:46:45.004
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claw in chat says, I'm really curious to hear how Rob sounds like while playing WoW.

02:46:45.044 --> 02:46:45.965
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how he acts.

02:46:46.045 --> 02:46:48.068
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it's not like that Onyxia wipe guy.

02:46:48.669 --> 02:46:53.194
[SPEAKER_10]: How do I sound playing WoW, Ryan, since you've been on Ventrilo with me playing World of Warcraft?

02:46:55.464 --> 02:46:56.584
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding.

02:46:56.604 --> 02:46:57.785
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you sound like you do now.

02:46:59.826 --> 02:47:02.427
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like we pretty much, you know, it's normal.

02:47:02.607 --> 02:47:05.449
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, nobody gets really too crazy in there.

02:47:05.469 --> 02:47:07.349
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like to do my wacky DJ voice.

02:47:07.490 --> 02:47:10.071
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you do not do your wacky DJ voice.

02:47:10.091 --> 02:47:12.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, everybody, let's go to the summoning stone.

02:47:12.692 --> 02:47:13.492

[SPEAKER_10]: I love WoW calls.

[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

02:47:48.639 --> 02:47:55.103
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's not enough WoW chat on this show that I want to start a whole other WoW show because there's not enough of them.

02:47:55.443 --> 02:47:59.065
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope there's people out there that would listen to a Robin Extra for a WoW show.

02:47:59.545 --> 02:48:00.346
[SPEAKER_03]: I might.

02:48:00.626 --> 02:48:01.186
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:48:01.226 --> 02:48:02.147
[SPEAKER_03]: At least we'd have half a listener.

02:48:02.207 --> 02:48:03.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't I confident?

02:48:03.327 --> 02:48:03.648
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:48:04.508 --> 02:48:05.268
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:08.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:11.532
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, you should celebrate this call by having a cupcake.

02:48:14.429 --> 02:48:15.750
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a total inside joke.

02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:16.390
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very rude.

02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:17.851
[SPEAKER_10]: That's brilliant.

02:48:17.951 --> 02:48:18.772
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very rude.

02:48:19.012 --> 02:48:19.832
[SPEAKER_10]: You ready for another call?

02:48:19.933 --> 02:48:20.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:48:22.014 --> 02:48:24.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you've reached Orange Slut Radio.

02:48:25.556 --> 02:48:26.237
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is this?

02:48:27.257 --> 02:48:28.878
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Dazzy Neater.

02:48:29.519 --> 02:48:31.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what's up?

02:48:33.221 --> 02:48:42.707
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just want to pass along a little tidbit, a bit of information to whatever listeners there are out there that's not in chat.

02:48:44.179 --> 02:48:52.503
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's an anime show that I just discovered called Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.

02:48:52.963 --> 02:48:53.603
[SPEAKER_01]: Just now?

02:48:55.344 --> 02:49:01.607
[SPEAKER_10]: I just discovered Hoarders, and that's been on for like a year and a half, and I'm just finding out about it.

02:49:01.667 --> 02:49:02.467
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know what?

02:49:02.507 --> 02:49:02.988
[SPEAKER_10]: Back off.

02:49:03.108 --> 02:49:03.848
[SPEAKER_03]: Judging you.

02:49:04.788 --> 02:49:05.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, continue.

02:49:05.909 --> 02:49:06.129
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:12.052
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I just discovered Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood myself.

02:49:13.533 --> 02:49:24.661
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's basically like a remake of an earlier show with the same name and it's pretty damn good.

02:49:26.222 --> 02:49:40.071
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I have no idea if it's on DVD or Blu-ray or anything like that but I happen to know that it is available for digital download.

02:49:41.892 --> 02:49:42.613
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to

02:49:43.496 --> 02:49:45.978
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like risk going that route.

02:49:46.479 --> 02:50:01.612
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as I complained about digital download before, but at least right now, the first 13 episodes are actually on sale on PSN for like 99 cents each.

02:50:03.874 --> 02:50:10.120
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap, but at the same time, if you guys have listened to my

02:50:11.164 --> 02:50:16.466
[SPEAKER_01]: Calls a few months ago, there's kind of a risk with digital downloads.

02:50:18.567 --> 02:50:20.828
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to take the risk, go for it.

02:50:22.569 --> 02:50:25.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you want to save some money, go ahead.

02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:30.953
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't think it's worth the risk, then look for a physical copy.

02:50:32.653 --> 02:50:36.395
[SPEAKER_10]: So all together to get the whole series, it's like 14 bucks basically?

02:50:36.415 --> 02:50:38.116
[SPEAKER_10]: What, 13 episodes, 99 cents a pop?

02:50:40.012 --> 02:50:46.237
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's only the first half of the series that's on sale.

02:50:47.157 --> 02:50:48.658
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like 25.

02:50:48.718 --> 02:50:49.679
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they get you.

02:50:49.979 --> 02:50:54.782
[SPEAKER_10]: They sucker you in to buy the first half, and then they're like, oh, but the second half is double the price.

02:50:56.604 --> 02:50:57.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly like that, Rob.

02:50:58.705 --> 02:51:00.226
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do at Sony headquarters.

02:51:02.395 --> 02:51:09.237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the weird thing is, though, you know, I'm not totally sure how Microsoft does their video marketplace.

02:51:09.277 --> 02:51:10.618
[SPEAKER_01]: I really haven't used it yet.

02:51:11.398 --> 02:51:21.601
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know at least over on PSN, you know, a lot of times they'll have, like, weekly sales on certain things, you know, wherever it's half off for that week.

02:51:22.582 --> 02:51:28.984
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times they even give away, like, pilots to shows, you know,

02:51:29.787 --> 02:51:48.426
[SPEAKER_01]: for free, and the whole thing, you know, hey, you know, this pilot that I got for free is good, you know, might as well buy the rest of the series, you know, but, you know, like I said, there's, you know, you know, the inherent risk of your system fucks up, you know, uh,

02:51:49.909 --> 02:51:55.894
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a chance that unless you play your cards right, you could lose out on the content that you bought.

02:51:55.954 --> 02:51:58.356
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to demand to speak to a supervisor, correct?

02:51:58.457 --> 02:52:02.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Based on what I learned in your previous calls about Sony Trauma.

02:52:04.101 --> 02:52:12.728
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, luckily, at least in the situations I've been in, I may have to work it out.

02:52:14.570 --> 02:52:16.431
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said earlier in the call, it's

02:52:18.247 --> 02:52:19.548
[SPEAKER_01]: Way out the pros and cons.

02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:22.831
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a solution to all of your Microsoft problems, by the way.

02:52:23.171 --> 02:52:24.332
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Sony problems, though.

02:52:24.572 --> 02:52:25.513
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony problems, whatever.

02:52:26.714 --> 02:52:27.975
[SPEAKER_05]: Hook up a computer to your TV.

02:52:29.095 --> 02:52:29.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

02:52:29.876 --> 02:52:30.537
[SPEAKER_05]: No more problem.

02:52:31.197 --> 02:52:31.838
[SPEAKER_05]: It works for us.

02:52:32.518 --> 02:52:34.079
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you a question?

02:52:35.480 --> 02:52:36.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to completely derail what you were saying.

02:52:36.961 --> 02:52:37.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you from?

02:52:39.003 --> 02:52:39.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Buffalo, New York.

02:52:40.164 --> 02:52:40.424
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:52:42.045 --> 02:52:43.046
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to place your accent.

02:52:44.608 --> 02:52:53.894
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the weird thing is my accent is not typical, though, because to get a little personal, I'm half Canadian.

02:52:53.954 --> 02:52:59.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone on my mother's side of the family is Canadian, and I spend a lot of time around my Canadian relatives.

02:52:59.737 --> 02:53:01.658
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't like Canadians in these parts.

02:53:02.959 --> 02:53:06.541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so my accent is a blend of Canadian.

02:53:07.287 --> 02:53:34.602
[SPEAKER_10]: The Buffalonian accent and the Canadian accent That's very cool because I was trying to I was actually thinking Great Lakes area but that's actually kind of close I don't want no damn Tim Hortons in my backyard I'm sorry to completely derail what you said but I've been trying to place it for several calls now We've got to say goodbye to Spazinator for now because we've got to go and wrap up But Spazinator, thank you for the deal alert and let's hope your PlayStation doesn't break again

02:53:35.742 --> 02:53:36.322
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

02:53:36.362 --> 02:53:36.843
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.

02:54:03.444 --> 02:54:09.447
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know that there's actually an old Battlestar Galactica that they did back in the 70s?

02:54:09.547 --> 02:54:10.727
[SPEAKER_10]: And Starbuck's a dude?

02:54:11.448 --> 02:54:11.908
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

02:54:11.988 --> 02:54:14.229
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen any of the new episodes, only the old ones.

02:54:14.449 --> 02:54:15.750
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the new ones are actually really good.

02:54:15.770 --> 02:54:16.890
[SPEAKER_10]: They're super good.

02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:18.071
[SPEAKER_10]: Starbuck cannot be a chick!

02:54:18.831 --> 02:54:19.411
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love this.

02:54:19.912 --> 02:54:21.152
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a coffee!

02:54:21.272 --> 02:54:26.155
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, this was my favorite comment during that whole call when Irene answered the call.

02:54:26.555 --> 02:54:29.236
[SPEAKER_10]: Izom says, Orange slut radio discusses anime.

02:54:29.356 --> 02:54:31.197
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you sure this isn't Orange Virgin Radio?

02:54:32.911 --> 02:54:35.113
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Orange Hentai Radio.

02:54:35.213 --> 02:54:36.534
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Tentacle Rape Radio.

02:54:36.574 --> 02:54:37.715

[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:54:39.716 --> 02:54:41.097
[SPEAKER_05]: The R stands for rape.

02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:44.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:47.702
[SPEAKER_10]: What is wrong with you?

02:54:50.325 --> 02:54:52.969
[SPEAKER_10]: That's horribly inappropriate.

02:54:53.890 --> 02:54:55.412
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about tentacles.

02:54:56.373 --> 02:55:00.399
[SPEAKER_10]: I really apologize to those callers that didn't get through tonight, but we've got to go and wrap things up.

02:56:24.484 --> 02:56:27.066

[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the latest advertisement about, you know, things and stuff?

02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:34.451

[SPEAKER_02]: T for two.

02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:48.901
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the matter, Robb?

02:56:50.492 --> 02:56:52.973
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:56:53.194 --> 02:56:53.974

[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

02:56:55.455 --> 02:56:56.776

02:56:57.196 --> 02:56:59.477
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to charge my devices, they're all dead now.

02:57:00.598 --> 02:57:01.018
[SPEAKER_10]: Jerks.

02:57:01.478 --> 02:57:04.160
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is, I have to charge my life.

02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:05.581
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dead now.

02:57:06.238 --> 02:57:07.238
[SPEAKER_10]: That was deep, Rob.

02:57:07.298 --> 02:57:07.799
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

02:57:07.819 --> 02:57:08.519

[SPEAKER_10]: See you.

02:57:31.906 --> 02:57:34.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Say a good word or two and help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:55.135
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to download one that actually gets updated once a week or at least once a month because iTunes has some things that have been molding since 2007 still on the store.

02:57:55.175 --> 02:57:56.476
[SPEAKER_10]: So just good luck with that.

02:57:57.076 --> 02:57:58.637
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, thanks again.

02:57:58.957 --> 02:58:00.018
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a wonderful night.

02:58:00.578 --> 02:58:01.499
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next week.

02:58:01.519 --> 02:58:04.400
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do this all over again with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:04.460 --> 02:58:06.582
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, good night.

02:58:07.182 --> 02:58:09.983
[SPEAKER_19]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:10.503 --> 02:58:13.744
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:58:14.184 --> 02:58:22.826
[SPEAKER_19]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

02:58:23.346 --> 02:58:34.969
[SPEAKER_19]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

02:58:35.529 --> 02:58:36.369

02:58:38.446 --> 02:58:40.097
