00:00.000 --> 00:20.240
Tonight, September 19th, 2010, a much-hyped MMO shuts down after only three months.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.440
Konami and Harmonix settle their rock band lawsuit, and the Nielsen Report rates the

00:24.440 --> 00:31.800
effectiveness of ads and video games.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.920 --> 00:36.920
Radio.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.180
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.180 --> 00:45.360
We meet live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

00:45.360 --> 00:49.560
Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, except tonight actually we didn't

00:49.560 --> 00:52.680
meet after the Bobby Black Wolf show because he's on vacation.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
How dare he?

00:53.680 --> 00:56.840
Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours.

00:56.840 --> 01:02.560
Say hello to my awesome co-hosts, the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.400
How are you my friend?

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
That good, huh?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
I'm doing fantastic, Rob.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.800
I'm glad to hear it.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.120
And how are you today?

01:10.120 --> 01:11.760
Super, thanks for asking.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.760
Great.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.960
Alright, also joining us, as he does every week, say hello to the one and only Techmaster

01:16.960 --> 01:17.960
Loki.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.240
That last fry didn't taste good.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.560
I'm sorry to hear that, but I heard you exclaim literally as the opening credits are rolling

01:23.560 --> 01:27.200
on our show, I hear Loki go, ooh, bonus onion ring.

01:27.200 --> 01:33.600
Yeah, because they mixed, they contaminated my fries with an onion ring in there.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.600
You don't like onion rings?

01:34.600 --> 01:35.600
Onion rings are the best.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
No, I do.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.400
I just wasn't expecting an onion ring, because I'm expecting their bland fries.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.840
That onion ring was a nice add to both.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.000
Now I could get just onion rings, but I do like their fries still, even though they are

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
bland.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.160
Another episode of Orange Lounge Foodio here as we tape live.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.820
Pretty busy weekend gaming, thanks to the Tokyo Game Show.

01:52.820 --> 01:56.440
There's a lot of news and stuff going on here in the States as well, just like so much to

01:56.440 --> 01:58.160
talk about tonight.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.960
We supposedly have some guests coming, but I got a text that they're running late, of

02:01.960 --> 02:05.940
course, because these people always run late, shh, don't tell them, but I'm assuming they'll

02:05.940 --> 02:09.480
be here any moment, so we'll introduce them whenever they show up.

02:09.480 --> 02:13.500
They probably won't come into the studio quietly, so I apologize in advance for any derailment

02:13.500 --> 02:16.280
that is bound to happen on this lovely radio program.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.540
It's okay, I dressed up.

02:18.540 --> 02:21.160
Let's talk, yes you did, you went all out today.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.440
Alright, she's wearing her pajamas just so you guys know.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.200
Alright, let's start it off with how was your gaming week and the types of video games you've

02:28.200 --> 02:31.180
been playing this week, and I know DarkSakura finally jumped into something because I got

02:31.180 --> 02:34.560
a text message earlier this week that let me know she did.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.120
So what's up DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

02:36.120 --> 02:44.280
I started Final Fantasy 13, and I got to the part where they transformed into special people,

02:44.280 --> 02:47.880
so that's as far as I am right now.

02:47.880 --> 02:52.840
And I'm playing The Sims 3 right now because Dan got me ambitions, and Dan's home from

02:52.840 --> 02:55.400
his trip and I'm so happy.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.560
And that's it.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.920
So Final Fantasy 13, what do you think of the battle system, it kind of takes forever

03:00.920 --> 03:02.400
to get going doesn't it?

03:02.400 --> 03:07.600
Yeah, I'm like, the game that plays itself, I'm just going to sit back and eat some rice

03:07.600 --> 03:10.320
and watch a movie.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.960
Which is basically how I've been treating it, it's like oh it's a movie that I can push

03:13.960 --> 03:16.240
a button every so often.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.600
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, you know it's you guys that really make the

03:20.600 --> 03:23.400
show every Sunday night as we do Tape Live.

03:23.400 --> 03:29.000
And go to lovely comments such as the following from Spazinator PSN in chat, if Jamie's doing

03:29.000 --> 03:33.440
fantastic then I'm Betty fucking Crocker, she sounds like frustrated as all hell.

03:33.440 --> 03:42.040
No, I had a long day yesterday because it was Yom Kippur, and so it's basically, to

03:42.040 --> 03:47.760
sum it up in a nutshell, it's the day of atonement, so basically you apologize a lot and don't

03:47.760 --> 03:50.440
need anything.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.840
That's putting a really simplistic view on it.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.080
It's really, it's very beautiful service, I was very happy to have attended all day,

04:00.080 --> 04:03.000
and I was very happy to eat when the sun went down.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.800
So after 24 hours of fasting, Betty fucking Crocker sounds pretty good, huh?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.960
More like 20, 26 hours?

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960
25?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.420
Oh, but who's counting?

04:11.420 --> 04:12.420
More sundown than post-sundown.

04:12.420 --> 04:16.440
Yeah, well, you end up counting.

04:16.440 --> 04:21.680
But it was a really nice experience, it was good, but I had to get up early this morning

04:21.680 --> 04:24.120
and record the other podcast.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.120
And then I had-

04:25.120 --> 04:26.120
That other show.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.480
Oh, bite my butt.

04:27.480 --> 04:34.280
And then I had to, I had to talk with my client for a little while, and then I just said like,

04:34.280 --> 04:36.120
forget the world, I'm taking a nap.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.380
And then I've got to do algebra homework tonight.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.400
And three poster designs tomorrow.

04:40.400 --> 04:45.440
Speaking of other podcasts, the Rob and Extefer Warcraft show is supposed to start this week,

04:45.440 --> 04:48.020
but sadly we ran into some technical difficulties.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.020
We can't seem to do Skype on my computer.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.020
Don't break my pen.

04:50.020 --> 04:53.080
I can't, I can't do Skype, I'm frustrated, no.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.400
I can't do Skype on my home computer like I can on the one here in the studio.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.560
So we weren't able to do our little thing, so I don't know what we're going to do.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.080
We'll figure it out, we're smart people.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.080
Just in time for Cataclysm, how appropriate.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.080
Are you smart fellers?

05:04.080 --> 05:05.080
Huh?

05:05.080 --> 05:06.640
Are you smart fellers or fart smellers?

05:06.640 --> 05:07.860
Shut up.

05:07.860 --> 05:12.900
Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki, and how was your gaming week?

05:12.900 --> 05:13.900
It was fine.

05:13.900 --> 05:19.720
I got my iPod finally, so I downloaded a bunch of stuff on there.

05:19.720 --> 05:26.080
And let's see, I tried a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies, because I have yet to jump into

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
that.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.080
It's pretty fun.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.480
Hopefully going to play a little bit more than that, other than like two minutes worth.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.920
And then, what else did I play?

05:36.920 --> 05:43.000
I played some of the Mirror's Edge game on the iPhone, which is kind of neat, very simplistic,

05:43.000 --> 05:48.040
but it still has that kind of same look as the full game.

05:48.040 --> 05:53.200
Fruit Ninja, because that's really easy and casual.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.480
So I actually kind of downloaded that, because it's actually one of the ones that is supported

05:56.480 --> 06:01.640
by Game Center, so I thought it'd be neat to try out.

06:01.640 --> 06:08.020
And of course I had to download Robot Unicorn Attack, because, well, I don't think I need

06:08.020 --> 06:12.080
to explain myself there.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.600
It's so surreal to me that you're coming in here and playing with your little iPod now.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.360
This is after like a good, I don't know, eight years of just Apple hatred that you see on

06:21.360 --> 06:22.360
this show.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
No, I still hate Apple.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.960
But you're sitting there playing with your iPod, like, hey Rob, let me see what apps

06:25.960 --> 06:28.520
you have, because I'm going to say, oh, Jamie, let me see your phone.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.080
It's just really funny to me.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.880
Well, okay, it's very convenient for browsing the web.

06:33.880 --> 06:40.140
For example, Nellie's mom came over, and she's like, I need the 800 number for AAA.

06:40.140 --> 06:43.400
And Nellie was like, okay, well let me boot up my laptop, and I'm like, okay, hold on,

06:43.400 --> 06:47.480
let me real quickly just turn my iPod on, hit the web browser, done.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.680
There's a AAA app that will actually put your little ID card in there and everything, and

06:51.680 --> 06:54.240
you can actually file a request over the application.

06:54.240 --> 06:59.800
Well, it wasn't, she didn't need, it was kind of weird because it was someone hit her that

06:59.800 --> 07:05.640
had AAA, so she needed a number to call them, got it.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.720
So yeah, so it's neat, and then the other thing that I got with that is I got a Virgin

07:09.720 --> 07:13.120
Mobile MiFi 2200, which is a 3G hotspot.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.800
In fact, I'm actually using that right now to connect to the web.

07:17.800 --> 07:23.000
It's literally, it is smaller than the iPod that I have right now, but it works pretty

07:23.000 --> 07:29.680
well, and it's like 40 bucks a month flat, so I'm kind of digging that a little bit.

07:29.680 --> 07:36.500
Console Games, of course, played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's just a given.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.400
Really ain't playing too much else other than that, because I just haven't had time.

07:40.400 --> 07:48.400
Wife's keeping me busy with keeping the baby, you know, out of her hair, and unfortunately

07:48.400 --> 07:54.720
that gives me like no time to do anything, so it's just, I'm really sad because I wanted

07:54.720 --> 07:58.720
to work on stuff this weekend, and instead I had to go shop for groceries for like two

07:58.720 --> 08:02.800
hours and run a bunch of errands, and then I come back home and she's like, I've been

08:02.800 --> 08:07.240
sitting here with the baby for all this time and he won't stop crying, here you take him.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.640
It's like, oh yeah, I haven't been doing anything at all, I've just been, you know, playing

08:11.640 --> 08:12.640
around.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.760
That's what you get for making babies.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
Breeders.

08:15.760 --> 08:22.480
So, yeah, so that's basically all I've done this week is mainly download a ton of apps.

08:22.480 --> 08:27.320
I've spent way too much money on apps, so that's for sure, I gotta cut back on that.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.800
This little 3G router thingy-ma-bobber you have, what is this again, a Virgin mobile?

08:31.800 --> 08:36.600
Well, it's called a MiFi 2200, they have them through Virgin, they have them through Sprint,

08:36.600 --> 08:42.840
AT&T I think even, and, but the plan that's the cheapest is actually the Virgin plan,

08:42.840 --> 08:51.840
and it piggybacks on the Sprint network, and it's flat $40, and it's, you know, there's

08:51.840 --> 08:57.000
no plan, so if you wanna use it, you pay 40 bucks and you get a full month worth of unlimited

08:57.000 --> 08:59.480
bandwidth, unlimited data, whatever.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.200
Now what surprised me about that is when I was looking at those things online, I thought

09:02.200 --> 09:06.120
they were the size of like a normal router, was my impression, but that thing is smaller

09:06.120 --> 09:09.320
than your phone, or not the phone, well, than an iPhone.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.320
Yeah.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.320
It's crazy.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.040
And, you know, literally I slip that into my back pocket and I just play around with

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
it.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
Jamie's gonna take a picture of it for the website.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.620
Put your thing next to it to compare sizes, because I was really impressed at how tiny

09:20.620 --> 09:22.960
that stinkin' thing is, it's crazy.

09:22.960 --> 09:29.560
Yeah, so, um, yeah, it's, it's really small, um, and it's kinda cool about it though is

09:29.560 --> 09:33.920
SeeSense, you know, I have like almost like a ghetto iPhone with this, because I have

09:33.920 --> 09:39.120
a program to, uh, send free text messages, so I can do that, and I have like a number

09:39.120 --> 09:43.520
that's associated with that now, so people can text me if they want to, um, and...

09:43.520 --> 09:46.480
You should give out that number here on the show and see what kind of text messages you

09:46.480 --> 09:47.720
get during the week.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.880
I really don't use it.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.720
Hi, Loki, I'm in the potty!

09:51.720 --> 09:54.440
I think that would be quite foolish.

09:54.440 --> 10:01.400
Uh, yeah, so I have that, and then, um, I don't know, I've just, I've been downloading

10:01.400 --> 10:05.100
a bunch of junk, because that's what I, I sit there, you know, I have the baby in my

10:05.100 --> 10:09.240
arm, and I'm sitting there just kinda browsing the internet, and I'm like, okay, hmm, what

10:09.240 --> 10:14.680
apps could I possibly need, um, oh, I know, they just talked about a police scanner app

10:14.680 --> 10:17.120
on TV, I'm gonna download that, okay, uh...

10:17.120 --> 10:19.120
He's an alcoholic.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.840
Pretty much, it's...

10:20.840 --> 10:24.080
And then in two months the novelty will wear off, and I'll be like, ugh.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.320
But hey, it doesn't matter though, because I didn't really pay any money for this, although

10:27.320 --> 10:31.300
I did spend a lot of money on apps, so Apple still wins in this.

10:31.300 --> 10:35.540
Going back to our chatroom and chat.orangelandrader.com, they always make A-plus comments such as this

10:35.540 --> 10:36.540
one.

10:36.540 --> 10:42.400
Alf in chat says, now Loki's butt will have cancer, and I'm assuming that's from the router.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
I don't always...

10:43.400 --> 10:47.760
Being in your butt, or next to your butt, or wherever it is, in close proximity to your

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
butt, will somehow give you butt cancer.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.800
Well, I can't really use it too much, you know, in my back pocket, because, um, if I

10:52.800 --> 11:00.040
sit down it turns it off, so, uh, that's not good, um, but you know, that's where I store

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
it for now.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.440
I don't store it in my butt, but my, but my pocket, yes.

11:05.440 --> 11:09.480
But if somebody did store it in their butt, they'd be like 3G everywhere they go.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.480
But it's so cool though, because see, like, not only can I...

11:11.480 --> 11:12.640
You can name the network Rob's butt.

11:12.640 --> 11:17.560
Not only can I connect to that, um, but other peop- it can sort of port up to five devices

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
at once.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.600
Um, I'd imagine it'd be very slow with five devices connected to it, but...

11:22.600 --> 11:25.040
Hey, I'm connected to your butt right now!

11:25.040 --> 11:29.360
Alright, um, let's introduce the guests, because they're dying to make a comment, and, uh,

11:29.360 --> 11:33.240
it's been forever, really, since these two have been on the show, but they're quite the

11:33.240 --> 11:36.740
duo, and if you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, I'm sure you've heard

11:36.740 --> 11:39.600
these guys on the show, they're loved by the masses.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.440
Not really, I just say that to talk about...

11:41.440 --> 11:43.640
Say hello to Rice Princess!

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
How are you?

11:44.640 --> 11:45.640
I'm good.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.640
So if you put it up...

11:46.640 --> 11:47.640
Wait, can we hear you?

11:47.640 --> 11:48.640
Oh, it's muted.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.640
Hi.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.640
La la la.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.640
Jerk.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.640
Hi, how are you?

11:52.640 --> 11:53.640
I'm good.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.600
So if you put the router up your butt, what if you accidentally poop it out, and it goes

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
in the water?

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
That...

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
Wouldn't that break it?

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
Maybe it might.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.600
Have to change the network to big dump.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
It might.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
Oh, and hi.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
Alright.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.880
Also, say hello to the one and only...

12:06.880 --> 12:08.160
The doctor is back!

12:08.160 --> 12:09.160
I'm the doctor!

12:09.160 --> 12:10.160
How are you?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.160
Pretty good, pretty good.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.960
And I just wanted you to say, Rob, there's- Rob's butt has been a network for years and

12:14.960 --> 12:16.960
years and years.

12:16.960 --> 12:21.680
That's pretty much the only com- Only, uh, yeah, I'm seeing the Sonic Screwdriver, which

12:21.680 --> 12:23.760
would also work in Rob's butt, so...

12:23.760 --> 12:24.760
So I'm gonna play with the Sonic Screwdriver.

12:24.760 --> 12:25.760
Here you go, Rice Princess.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.280
You know, I am not comfortable with how much of the discussion on this show is about my

12:29.280 --> 12:30.280
butt.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.280
I, uh...

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
I'm not okay with that.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.280
It's your own fault.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
It really is.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
Yeah.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
Alright.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
Well, what have you- what the hell have you been up to, Rice Princess?

12:37.280 --> 12:40.040
Were you- you have been on the show in like a year, it seems like, because I don't think

12:40.040 --> 12:43.000
you've been since we've been here at Studio Sakura.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.920
I haven't, and I'm kind of insulted that you didn't notice that the doctor and I are wearing-

12:47.920 --> 12:51.240
You are wearing Madison Castlevania shirts, because it's old school and new school.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.480
Yeah, mine's better, but- Isn't today a special day in the, uh, relationship between you and

12:55.480 --> 12:56.480
the doctor?

12:56.480 --> 13:02.000
Yeah, it's the first time we had sex, because he's straight.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
And me?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Really?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I thought it was- Yes.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.860
No, September- September 9th, 2000- Oh my gosh.

13:08.860 --> 13:09.860
Was the night we all met.

13:09.860 --> 13:10.860
Oh my gosh.

13:10.860 --> 13:11.860
Yeah.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.640
I thought it was Irene I met in like November.

13:13.640 --> 13:17.600
Yeah, and then we all- we all went back to your apartment and played Wheel of Fortune.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.600
Good times.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
In Roseville.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.600
And butt sex.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.320
Rob's network was on that night.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.320
Shut up.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.160
And I've got a- I've got a gift to regale you with.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.160
You can open later.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.160
You didn't have to bring gifts.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
Well, that's alright.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
But I'll take it.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
It's poop.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.160
Yay.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.600
So you're wearing matching castle- well, they're not matching Castlevania shirts, it's old school

13:36.600 --> 13:37.920
Castlevania new school.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.520
Mine's Symphony of the Night, so mine's automatically cooler.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.520
Yeah, his is old school.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.520
But his is great.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.520
Yeah, no.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.520
I like his too.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.000
That means we have to push the start key now.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Alright.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Where is the start key?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm not gonna ask where that is.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
But where is the start key is the question.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Finding is the game, actually.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.320
That's- that's the other game.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.960
That's a scary game.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
Yeah.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.200
Since you guys haven't been on the show in a while, we actually have some new listeners.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.520
Believe it or not, like people actually like subscribe to the show and stay subscribed.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.200
Is it the same five people under different names?

14:06.200 --> 14:10.660
No, we've got emails and like people are like, hey, I just started listening and my first

14:10.660 --> 14:12.360
show was the fuck show and I'm like, really?

14:12.360 --> 14:14.280
And you didn't unsubscribe after that?

14:14.280 --> 14:15.280
Yeah.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.280
That's amazing.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.280
You're weird.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.800
So for those that maybe haven't heard you on the show before, what kind of video games

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
are you into?

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
What do you like to play?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.760
What- what- what types of stuff you've been playing right now, Rice Princess?

14:24.760 --> 14:28.480
I don't play anything now except for WoW because, you know, I have a love-hate relationship

14:28.480 --> 14:29.480
with it.

14:29.480 --> 14:35.360
But I like, um, like Super Nintendo games, Nintendo games, like stuff- older stuff.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.360
Retro stuff.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.200
Yeah, I don't- I haven't really played much on the newer gen.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.640
What would you say is a totally underrated retro game?

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
Clash at Demonhead.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.640
I knew you were going to say that.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
Of course you knew I was going to say that.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.640
Duh.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.640
Why is that game underrated?

14:47.640 --> 14:50.520
Because it's fucking awesome and no one's played it.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.960
Did you- did you get a little hot when you saw that the band in the Scott Pilgrim movie

14:53.960 --> 14:55.320
was called Clash at Demonhead?

14:55.320 --> 14:58.720
Yes, because I was probably the only person in the theater who's actually played that

14:58.720 --> 14:59.720
game.

14:59.720 --> 15:00.720
It was awesome.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.720
Yes.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.720
I liked it a lot.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
Yes.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
Good times.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
What about you, Eddie?

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
How about The Doctor?

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
The Doctor, what types of games have you been playing lately?

15:07.720 --> 15:13.480
Not much lately, because like The Rice Princess, I own a Wii, so I'm a very angry Wii player

15:13.480 --> 15:15.120
because there's no games for it.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.680
I looked at my Wii history for the past six months and it's just Netflix.

15:18.680 --> 15:23.360
There's no games being played, but before that I had downloaded Cave Story in the virtual

15:23.360 --> 15:26.760
console which is a really fun 8-bit style game.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.880
So yeah, I like a lot of old school stuff.

15:27.880 --> 15:33.000
I like the new stuff, I just don't like Halo and Call of Duty and stuff, so I like adventure

15:33.000 --> 15:35.760
type games and there's not a lot of that on the Wii.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.280
It's mostly a soccer mom console now.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.720
What about Metroid Other M?

15:38.720 --> 15:39.720
That was the big thing.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.880
I've heard terrible reviews on that though, like I want to play it, but I've heard terrible

15:42.880 --> 15:43.880
reviews.

15:43.880 --> 15:44.880
I don't know what you guys think.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.600
I'm a little worried because it's supposed to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid and

15:47.600 --> 15:50.320
I've heard a lot of awful things about it, but I've heard some really good things about

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
it, so I don't know.

15:51.320 --> 15:56.880
I've heard play-wise, it's fantastic, story-wise, it's balls.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.680
And not the good kind of balls.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
Ray D.N.

15:59.680 --> 16:06.080
Silver Gun in our chat room says, I get it, says you should get Sin and Punishment 2.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.840
I get it.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.000
How about Sin and Punishment 2?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.240
I don't know what the hell that is.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.240
It's on the Wii!

16:11.240 --> 16:12.240
It's Sin and Punishment.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.240
Okay, I still don't know what it is.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.240
Not you, him!

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
Oh, fine.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Screw you, it's for him.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
It's a shooter.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.920
Yeah, it's another shooter, which, you know, I'd play that if I wanted to go to sleep,

16:19.920 --> 16:20.920
so.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.920
Alright, fine.

16:21.920 --> 16:26.480
I don't trust the industry nowadays, because remember how they said Shattered Memories was

16:26.480 --> 16:29.120
like the best game at E3?

16:29.120 --> 16:30.840
Fucking worst game ever made.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.600
Oh, I just want to punch Silent Hill.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.640
What was wrong with Silent Hill Shattered Memories?

16:35.640 --> 16:36.640
Everything.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.640
It wasn't a game.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.360
It was just like, here, I'm going to poop on your face.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.480
I don't remember the poop on your face scene, actually.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.720
I remember it, because that's all that happened over and over.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.720
I don't.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.520
Like, oh my gosh, oh, Alessa, it's you, poop on your face!

16:52.520 --> 16:57.200
It's like, you son of a bitch, you got me again!

16:57.200 --> 17:00.440
I thought it was going to be different this time, but no.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.960
Did you and I play the same game?

17:01.960 --> 17:04.040
Because I just remembered the snow and a lot of running.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.040
I don't remember.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.760
You didn't see the tracks of shit everywhere?

17:07.760 --> 17:08.760
No?

17:08.760 --> 17:09.760
I don't.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.760
Okay.

17:10.760 --> 17:11.760
Yeah.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.680
Maybe I got the director's cut or something, I don't know, but I got the shit on your face

17:15.680 --> 17:16.680
version.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
Okay.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
I'll stop cussing now.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
Alright.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
No, that's alright.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
It's a family show.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.520
Let's see.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.520
My gaming week.

17:24.520 --> 17:25.520
Exposure!

17:25.520 --> 17:26.520
Exposure!

17:26.520 --> 17:27.520
Let's see.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.760
What types of stuff did I play this week?

17:28.760 --> 17:29.760
Who cares?

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
No.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
Not a lot of news.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.760
Wow.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
Wow.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
Wow.

17:34.760 --> 17:38.560
I played the WoW beta today because I finally got my character to copy over, so I was able

17:38.560 --> 17:39.960
to look at the new zones.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.800
Have you done any of the sillies or the flirts?

17:42.800 --> 17:43.800
They are raunchy!

17:43.800 --> 17:44.800
For the new?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.880
Yeah, for goblins and wargons.

17:47.880 --> 17:48.880
I haven't.

17:48.880 --> 17:53.360
I played a wargon at like level six, and I got all excited because female wargons showed

17:53.360 --> 17:59.800
up this week, but you can make one and see what it looks like, but you can't actually

17:59.800 --> 18:01.400
click the button that says create character.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.240
Yeah, it says decline or whatever.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
Yeah, invalid.

18:04.240 --> 18:09.560
But it's not a PG-13 thing anymore.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.520
It's like getting into R-rated material.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.600
One of the female goblin, I think it's a flirt, was like, yeah, and then he asked me to go

18:16.600 --> 18:20.840
up on him, and I'm just like, what the hell?

18:20.840 --> 18:21.840
That's pretty funny.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.840
Maybe you're just getting too old.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.400
No, but then there was another one where he's like, I've got something for you, and then

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
he just unzips his pants.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.640
That's just straight up sexual.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.600
That is not teenager stuff.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.120
And then Rob was like, let's release the sassy squad, and he took his pants off.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.520
Did I quit playing well at the wrong time?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.960
I don't have the sassy squad anymore.

18:41.960 --> 18:42.960
I'm a paladin.

18:42.960 --> 18:43.960
I know.

18:43.960 --> 18:44.960
Boo.

18:44.960 --> 18:45.960
But you have the sassy hair.

18:45.960 --> 18:51.480
No, but Alan plays the boomkin now, so he has a sassy squad, but that's not what they're

18:51.480 --> 18:52.480
called.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.600
Not nearly as sassy as you're- No.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.440
He actually is really good.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.720
He really is a great boomkin.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.720
He's a big fucking geek.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.140
I'm not just saying that because he's listening.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.360
He knows what he's doing in that game.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.360
I don't know.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.360
I just push three buttons.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
I'm a hunter, you know?

19:06.360 --> 19:09.360
But he's like, oh, you just do this to raise your hit cap, and blah, blah, blah.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
I'm just like, what?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.920
Speak English.

19:12.920 --> 19:19.440
No, but here's the thing is that the beta, I started playing the beta today with my paladin

19:19.440 --> 19:21.320
and going into some of the new Love Lady areas.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.560
So I went to Mount Hijal, right, and started fighting some of the new monsters.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.760
Wow got hard.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.760
It did.

19:26.760 --> 19:32.480
But all of a sudden, I went from having two heals to having six, and I don't know which

19:32.480 --> 19:36.960
one to cast, and then my rep paladin is all like, oh, now you got to have holy power to

19:36.960 --> 19:39.760
do all this shit, and oh my God, they changed everything.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.760
It hurts.

19:40.760 --> 19:46.200
They did, and Extifer, our buddy Extifer, he tried to heal for one of the raids, and

19:46.200 --> 19:50.440
he's like, I couldn't keep anyone above 50% health, and blah, blah, blah.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.520
I'm like, I don't really know what that means because I'm not a healer, but that sucks,

19:53.520 --> 19:54.520
I guess.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
I don't know.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.720
You make it sound like it's terrible, so I guess it is, but yeah, he was saying it was

19:59.720 --> 20:00.720
really hard.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.720
But you know what I have?

20:01.720 --> 20:02.720
Photon torpedoes.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
Nice.

20:03.720 --> 20:04.720
Whatever.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.720
Well, I've got quarantined torpedoes.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.720
Whoa.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.720
Actually, I'm using transphasic torpedoes.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
Ah, I hate you.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.720
All right, I didn't...

20:09.720 --> 20:10.720
Star Trek Online?

20:10.720 --> 20:11.720
Why aren't you playing Star Trek Online?

20:11.720 --> 20:12.720
Maybe you're bigger.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.720
Yeah, yeah.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.720
Because he doesn't play MMOs.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.720
Oh, he doesn't play MMOs.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.720
He tried playing WoW for like a week.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.720
You know what he did in WoW?

20:17.720 --> 20:22.400
He would hide in the Moonwell ponds and do shadow meld, and when someone would run by,

20:22.400 --> 20:24.720
he'd go, boo, and come out of shadow meld.

20:24.720 --> 20:30.720
That was the extent of his experience in WoW.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.640
Why didn't he play on a roleplay server?

20:32.640 --> 20:33.640
You know why?

20:33.640 --> 20:38.560
Because his computer lagged so hard, he would run in place like eight times.

20:38.560 --> 20:43.400
I had my computer at like 200 megabytes of RAM, and so it was like, I couldn't play WoW,

20:43.400 --> 20:44.400
so it was terrible.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.680
So that's what I did.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.720
You know, I had to upgrade my graphics card and everything to run Star Trek Online decently.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
Oh, really?

20:50.720 --> 20:51.720
Yeah.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.800
And the chat room's all bitching, like, oh, I don't understand what you're talking about.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.800
You lost me after Pally.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.840
I'm going to go play Shattered Memories and get shit on on my face.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.840
So let me move on.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
Just kidding.

21:02.840 --> 21:07.300
Oh, and then SSG100Matt says, at least it's better than Final Fantasy XI.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.640
That's totally true.

21:08.640 --> 21:09.640
That's not saying much.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.640
What about XIV, huh?

21:10.640 --> 21:11.640
Oh, that gem.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.640
Let's not go there.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.560
All right, and then I played some iPhone games.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.160
Actually, speaking of MMOs, I played a new iPhone MMO that's so much better than the

21:20.160 --> 21:21.400
one I played last week.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.460
This one is called I forget the name.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.460
It's called Legends.

21:25.460 --> 21:26.460
Wow.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.240
I think that's short for something else.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.880
Player Legends or Play Legends or something.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.000
It's free.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It's neat.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.160
It's got 3D.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.400
It sounds unique and not generic at all.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
Not at all.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
But you know what?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
It was free.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
So I'm not going to complain.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.400
And then I played Netflix.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.400
You played Netflix?

21:42.400 --> 21:43.400
Yes.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
Alan and I started watching Hoarders.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.400
Oh, my God.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.960
Isn't that a terribly addictive show?

21:47.960 --> 21:51.520
It's like you feel bad, but it's like you can't.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.520
The chocolate chips, Alan.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
They're chocolate chips.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.520
Oh, my God.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
It's horrible.

21:56.520 --> 22:01.800
Well, I watch Hoarders because A, Alan likes to joke about how that's going to be us in

22:01.800 --> 22:02.800
like 20 years.

22:02.800 --> 22:07.080
But B, like it actually makes me feel better about myself because if you'd asked me before

22:07.080 --> 22:10.480
I'd watch that show, like Rob, are you a hoarder, I probably would have said, yeah, I'm a little

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
bit of a hoarder.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.960
But after watching that show, I'm like, no, no, absolutely not.

22:13.960 --> 22:14.960
Oh, hell no.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.080
I'd never let it get that bad.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
Yeah.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
It's pretty bad on that show.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
I don't know.

22:20.080 --> 22:26.440
You're just getting a little, I'm going to say I've known you for a while, you know.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.920
Some of the things on that show are really, I would never let an animal die under all

22:29.920 --> 22:30.920
the stuff.

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
That you know of.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.920
I know.

22:32.920 --> 22:33.920
Yeah.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.920
All right.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.920
Anyhow.

22:35.920 --> 22:36.920
This is why Rob doesn't have a kitty.

22:36.920 --> 22:37.920
Yeah.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.920
Or Zach and Kelly.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.920
Remember them?

22:39.920 --> 22:40.920
That was different.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.360
That was different, huh?

22:42.360 --> 22:46.640
They had, they didn't die under the weight of crap around the house or anything.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.920
They actually had their own little tank that they could swim around in.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.000
It's not my fault.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.600
One of them decided to swim right up the filter and die.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.160
And what happened to the other one?

22:55.160 --> 22:57.160
I flushed it down the toilet.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.160
I don't remember.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.160
Was it alive when you did?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.160
No.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
No.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.160
The other one died of sadness.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.560
I didn't feed him for a week and he was so sad.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.560
He died.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.960
Well, I mean, if your little fish friend just decided to seppuku up the filter when you're

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
just...

23:11.960 --> 23:12.960
I don't think he's seppuku'd.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.520
I think you bought the wrong one.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.520
You murderer!

23:15.520 --> 23:19.240
I bought the tank at Walmart.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.360
That was a death wish right there.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.000
We can't talk about this anymore.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm getting so sad.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Good.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.240
I'm detecting trauma in this room.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.240
Uh oh.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.240
So housekeeping.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.240
Hi.

23:30.240 --> 23:34.080
If you like our show, you should join our Facebook club at facebook.com slash orange

23:34.080 --> 23:35.080
lounge radio.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.960
We also have a Twitter because that's all the cool kids do these days is tweet.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.040
And we have a Twitter at, not a Twitter fan, the doctor.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.040
I see you over there.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.240
I said Twitter and you were like, no, I like the, uh, the Futurama spooper was like, here's

23:48.240 --> 23:50.800
a twit now.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.800
It's true.

23:51.800 --> 23:52.800
Twitter.com slash olr.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.560
That's where you can go.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.560
Anyhow.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
I do not have any cute shows on this game.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.920
How about video game news, actual bonafide video game news, cause the Tokyo game show

24:01.920 --> 24:02.920
happened this week.

24:02.920 --> 24:03.920
So there's a lot of news out of there.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.520
But we're not starting there tonight actually.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.520
What a horrible segue.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.080
Where are we starting tonight, Loki?

24:09.080 --> 24:14.000
Ah, yes, we're starting with, this is funny cause I could have been affected by this,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.440
but thanks to procrastination, uh, I was not.

24:18.440 --> 24:23.720
The MMO APB, or what I like to call it, Grand Theft Auto the MMO.

24:23.720 --> 24:28.720
More like Saintsboro the MMO, but you know, whatever.

24:28.720 --> 24:34.240
It was a cops and robbers MMO game developed by Realtime Worlds who did the wonderful game

24:34.240 --> 24:43.040
Crackdown and it launched in the US on June 29th and basically had players playing both

24:43.040 --> 24:50.280
the enforcers and criminals and you know, you'd go around creating crime or stopping

24:50.280 --> 24:56.760
crime and leveled up and so on and it was one of the big features about it was the wonderful

24:56.760 --> 24:57.760
character editor.

24:57.760 --> 25:01.880
I mean you could literally create all sorts of stuff with it.

25:01.880 --> 25:10.440
But unfortunately, I guess it didn't do too well cause it's closed down already.

25:10.440 --> 25:18.040
Realtime Worlds faced massive layoffs last month and I guess before going into administration,

25:18.040 --> 25:23.720
which is I guess the UK equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy.

25:23.720 --> 25:32.800
So yeah, they weren't doing too well and the quote on the official website is, APB had

25:32.800 --> 25:37.200
a fantastic journey but unfortunately that journey has come to a premature end.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.920
Today we are sad to announce that despite everyone's best efforts to keep the service

25:40.920 --> 25:42.840
running, APB is coming to a close.

25:42.840 --> 25:47.280
It has been a pleasure working on APB and with all of its players together we will be

25:47.280 --> 25:52.080
building an absolutely amazing game, or we were building an absolutely amazing game and

25:52.080 --> 25:53.360
for that we thank you.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.480
You guys are awesome.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.360
And the thousands of you that paid for this game just got F'd in the A, right?

25:58.360 --> 25:59.360
Uh, yeah.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.000
I'm not hearing a lot about the backlash.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
I mean, is it just because literally no one bought this game or, I mean, it seems so strange

26:07.000 --> 26:09.800
to me that an MMO could just get away with shutting down after three months.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.640
It wasn't if you're really an MMO.

26:11.640 --> 26:16.320
I mean, it's barely an MMO, especially by today's standards for multiplayer games.

26:16.320 --> 26:21.680
I mean, it was a hundred player instances basically that you got to play in.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.720
Can you play it offline though?

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
No.

26:24.720 --> 26:29.780
Well, so if you dropped 60 bucks on this game just three months ago, you paid $20 a month

26:29.780 --> 26:32.000
and then some for bleh.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.760
That stinks.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.480
I kind of like tabula rasa member.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.880
Well tabula rasa lasted at least a good year.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
Yeah.

26:42.880 --> 26:47.320
I mean three months is, and it's, that's sad.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.800
I'd rather get a hooker.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.800
Exactly.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.680
Think of all the things you could have bought for that 60 bucks.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.680
I don't know.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.680
I guess it's just kind of sad.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.840
Remember APB last for three months, but an STD lasts forever.

26:56.840 --> 26:57.840
Exactly.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.440
Do we have any listeners in the chat room who actually bought APB and are kind of pissed

27:01.440 --> 27:02.440
about this closure?

27:02.440 --> 27:05.520
I mean, I don't know if any of our listeners are the type that get low key.

27:05.520 --> 27:10.440
You, you talked about this game an awful lot before it came out and then you, you didn't.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.120
I mean, did you even get into it?

27:12.120 --> 27:15.360
I was in the beta, so I played it for a little bit.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.360
It was okay.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.040
It's just, it was one of those things I didn't want to buy it cause I didn't think I had

27:19.040 --> 27:23.520
time to play it and if I had, I definitely wouldn't have had time to play it.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.400
So that's why I didn't buy it.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.560
It was fun to check it out.

27:29.560 --> 27:34.240
It's too bad because I think it would have worked better as a console game, you know,

27:34.240 --> 27:38.420
with an actual, it's just like something that should have been like a, as a Saints Row type

27:38.420 --> 27:40.040
of thing or something like that.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.360
You know, have the actual main storyline and everything and have like some really fleshed

27:44.360 --> 27:48.800
out online mode where you can play, you know, either the cops or the enforcers and level

27:48.800 --> 27:53.320
up and have a really cool, you know, character editor and stuff like that.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.560
That's what I could have saw this being, but it wasn't.

27:56.560 --> 28:02.960
However, all may not be lost cause apparently Epic Games is interesting, or is interested

28:02.960 --> 28:06.120
in buying the rights to the game.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.480
So maybe we'll see, you know, APB come back in some other form.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.400
It'd be interesting.

28:13.400 --> 28:20.480
I guess Eurogamer was reporting this saying that, according to the BBC, source close to

28:20.480 --> 28:26.800
the development team, a few companies are showing interest in picking up APB's rights

28:26.800 --> 28:32.540
and apparently one of those companies is Epic Games, of course the company behind the Gears

28:32.540 --> 28:35.120
of War and Unreal Tournament series.

28:35.120 --> 28:39.200
And also adding to the speculation, Eurogamer, they were saying citing Dundee development

28:39.200 --> 28:47.160
source in real time, I guess was based in Dundee, Scotland, that Dave Jones, the real

28:47.160 --> 28:54.720
time world's boss, and Epic were, is quite the talking, or is quite the talking point

28:54.720 --> 28:55.720
in the town.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.960
He says he and Mr. Rain are good chums and have worked together on many levels for years

28:59.960 --> 29:05.200
and years and years, and he's not gonna raise much money and staff here in the near future,

29:05.200 --> 29:10.160
so it's sounding like that maybe Epic will buy them.

29:10.160 --> 29:15.560
I guess that's good, but still, I mean what type of precedence is this set for the future?

29:15.560 --> 29:21.400
Like I'm still just picturing, you know, thousands, well at least hundreds of angry gamers that

29:21.400 --> 29:27.600
bought this game, tens of angry gamers that bought this game that feel really screwed

29:27.600 --> 29:33.120
about it closing, you know what I mean?

29:33.120 --> 29:37.000
Okay this is the first time that's ever happened on The Sims that the shirt just disappears.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.720
Dark Soccer doesn't prefer to actually listen to the show when it's going on.

29:41.720 --> 29:45.680
She plays The Sims while the show's going on, and we all look over there, like at the

29:45.680 --> 29:48.840
same time, don't know why, we just all kind of look over at her computer, she's dressing

29:48.840 --> 29:52.400
some character right now, and it's a female character she's dressing, and we look over

29:52.400 --> 29:59.160
there, and no top, no top on, just titties hanging out, what kind of game are you playing

29:59.160 --> 30:00.160
over there?

30:00.160 --> 30:04.340
Oh no, I tried to change her shirt and all of a sudden her boobs just pop out.

30:04.340 --> 30:07.920
That's what happens.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.320
Question in our chatroom at chat.orangeslaundry.com, or more of a statement from our buddy Segg,

30:11.320 --> 30:16.980
I haven't seen him in chat in forever, hi Segg, watch it become like Uru missed online

30:16.980 --> 30:18.560
and never die.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.020
Missed online got resurrected about three or four times.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.020
That's true.

30:23.020 --> 30:26.880
It would be neat, it was alright, but once again, you know, doing 100 player instances

30:26.880 --> 30:34.640
is not really an MMO, I mean, look at MAG, I mean, that's, I think, what, got 128 players

30:34.640 --> 30:35.760
at a time?

30:35.760 --> 30:40.560
And they all call it an MMO, they call it like an MMO, an action game I guess, or something

30:40.560 --> 30:41.560
like that.

30:41.560 --> 30:45.880
I think this is all an elaborate scheme to justify the online pass, because the people

30:45.880 --> 30:48.800
who made this game didn't charge for the online pass, did they?

30:48.800 --> 30:53.400
And so they're gonna say, because we weren't charging the $10 premium, we had to shut down

30:53.400 --> 30:54.400
the servers.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.360
But that doesn't make any sense, why would they charge for an online pass if they're

30:56.360 --> 30:58.080
charging for online anyways?

30:58.080 --> 31:00.920
Oh, I'm sorry, you have to, they don't have a used market for PC titles.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.920
Well why not, what's stopping them these days?

31:02.920 --> 31:06.400
I'm sorry, you gotta pay, you gotta pay another $10 for online access.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.280
I can't play without online access.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.280
That's too bad.

31:10.280 --> 31:15.840
You know, every time we play these games, especially the online ones, we have to accept

31:15.840 --> 31:20.840
like a, you know, terms of conditions, a user agreement basically, right?

31:20.840 --> 31:25.680
When are we gonna make the company sign the company agreement when we buy their games?

31:25.680 --> 31:30.000
You know, if I plop 60 bucks on this game, you need to keep the damn servers up for at

31:30.000 --> 31:33.440
least a year, or you know, XYZ.

31:33.440 --> 31:39.000
Unrealistic, yes, but this, I don't know, I just think this is a bad precedence if this

31:39.000 --> 31:44.060
just kind of slips away and people are just like, oh well, it was a crappy game anyway.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.400
You know, oh well.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.100
I think they should get their money back, or people that bought it should get their

31:49.100 --> 31:55.560
money back, but unfortunately the company has no money to give back, so, oh well, too

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
bad.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
You do.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.560
Live and learn.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.760
Maybe if you have one of those like best buy replacement plans, you can go take the game

32:01.760 --> 32:07.560
back, say hey don't work no more, I don't know, good luck, we'll see if that works.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.980
Something that might have worked a little better had it come out would have been this

32:10.980 --> 32:13.200
patent that was discovered by Sony last week.

32:13.200 --> 32:17.240
It was a last gen console adapter.

32:17.240 --> 32:22.920
Could explain why there was never PS2 backwards compatibility after of course the very, very

32:22.920 --> 32:25.180
first PlayStation 3 console.

32:25.180 --> 32:28.320
It was removed from the console pretty quickly to help cut down on cost.

32:28.320 --> 32:32.240
Then there were rumors that it was going to come out on the download service, the PlayStation

32:32.240 --> 32:35.720
network, we would see PlayStation 2 games, but that never seemed to happen either.

32:35.720 --> 32:41.320
Well, apparently one of the tech sites over in Japan, Gigazine, discovered a patent that

32:41.320 --> 32:47.720
was filed by Sony Japan back in February of 09, which described an adapter, and it would

32:47.720 --> 32:52.760
serve as a bridge for older gen games to be played on a current gen console, and honestly

32:52.760 --> 32:58.160
when I look at the picture it looks like you are attaching a PlayStation 2 to your PlayStation

32:58.160 --> 32:59.160
3.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.240
That is retarded.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.240
Is it bad?

33:03.240 --> 33:04.240
I still kind of want one.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
Gigazine.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
No, no, no, here's what they would do too.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.760
They would charge like $150 for that, you know.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.760
Even though the PS2 is $100.

33:10.760 --> 33:11.760
Exactly.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.760
Because they don't learn.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.280
It's just like, you know, oh hey, we're going to release this system, we're going to call

33:16.280 --> 33:22.600
it the PSP Go, and yeah, we know that the regular PSP is out right now for like $150

33:22.600 --> 33:26.640
and that it can play UMD discs, but this new PSP that we're releasing, it's not going to

33:26.640 --> 33:27.640
be able to play UMD discs.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.160
You're going to have to download all your titles, oh, and we're going to charge $200

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
for it.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.160
Oh, I'm sorry, no, $250 for it.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.160
Smart.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.160
Now something to keep in mind, just to be technical.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.160
Oh, and a PS3.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.160
That's only $299.

33:39.160 --> 33:43.880
Pat doesn't specifically say it's for PlayStation 2 games.

33:43.880 --> 33:49.400
It's just for older games, but if you think about it, okay, PlayStation 3 already plays

33:49.400 --> 33:51.520
PlayStation 1 games, hmm, I wonder why this is left.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.240
No, no, no, you need this additional adapter to play PlayStation 2.

33:54.240 --> 34:00.040
No, it's going to play Dreamcast games and Sega CD games.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.360
It plays HD DVD, who knew?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.040
Wow, that's backwards compatible.

34:04.040 --> 34:08.880
All right, so, yeah, it doesn't sound like this would be too incredibly popular if it

34:08.880 --> 34:09.880
came out.

34:09.880 --> 34:10.880
I don't know.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.120
If it was the right price, I'd probably buy it.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.120
You know why?

34:14.120 --> 34:16.600
To save on the shelf space.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.600
Because I don't...

34:17.600 --> 34:20.120
How do you figure?

34:20.120 --> 34:24.960
Because if I have to get a PlayStation 2 out to hook up, that's a whole nother AC adapter,

34:24.960 --> 34:27.840
that's a whole nother set of RGB cords, that's a whole nother...

34:27.840 --> 34:30.040
Girlfriend, you just lazy.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.040
You lazy.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.040
Yeah, pretty much.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.040
Pretty much.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
Actually, you're wrong.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.120
It's not another set of RGB cords.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.000
It's actually the exact same set.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.280
But you have to move it from the PS3 to PS2.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.280
You know what?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.280
They probably just spray painted a PS2.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.280
Well, that's definitely worth $150.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
It is.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.040
They're just like, oh, let's change this to an off gray.

34:48.040 --> 34:57.720
Or you can spend, I don't know, $10 and get one of those stupid console switching devices.

34:57.720 --> 35:02.280
What if this little bridge actually made the games better, too?

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
Like I don't...

35:03.280 --> 35:06.560
Obviously, you can't change the games themselves.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.160
Let's play Big Rigs now.

35:08.160 --> 35:12.760
Keep in mind, Rob, Mythbusters did prove that you can polish a turd.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.760
But it...

35:13.760 --> 35:14.760
Ew.

35:14.760 --> 35:23.680
This screeching hall was brought to you by Dark Sakura and her lovely insights.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.920
What if it like, up-res the resolution of the game, and...

35:26.920 --> 35:28.880
Yeah, that'd be so amazing.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.880
If only a console did that already.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.360
Oh, yeah, the PlayStation 3 does.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
That's so crazy.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.240
But not for PS2 games.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.000
It did if you got one of the launch systems.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Well, too bad not a lot of people bought one of the launch systems.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Well, you should have done that.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Lower your standards.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Don't give me $700 or whatever the hell those things cost back then.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
They were crazy.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
$599 US dollars.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Well...

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
I don't know.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Alright, I'm over it.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
You guys are mean.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
It's stupid that you know it, Rob.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Everybody's picking on me.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.720
The best part about that, though, is I have one of those systems that plays PlayStation

36:01.720 --> 36:05.160
2 games, and I don't play any PlayStation 2 games in it at all.

36:05.160 --> 36:11.360
I would play Final Fantasy XII,.hack, because I never did beat it, and Magic Pen Gel.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.600
But don't you have a PS2 already?

36:13.600 --> 36:16.240
In a box somewhere.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.400
We've used ours to play PS2 games.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.360
I don't want to actually look for my PS2.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.520
I'm gonna go buy this thing for my PS3.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.520
You don't understand.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.520
No, I don't.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.440
A, there's no guarantee the PS2 still works.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.800
B, it's a whole other set of cords that you have to hook into the back of the TV.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.600
God, you must be the laziest person.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.840
There's no guarantee that it works, so I'm not even gonna try.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.720
I'm just gonna drop this hundred-whatever-the-fuck dollars on this thing.

36:43.720 --> 36:48.600
You were here the other week, when we had the 32X hooked up, and that's a whole bunch

36:48.600 --> 36:49.600
of cables.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.720
Yeah, but you guys are a special kind of crazy.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.720
You know what?

36:52.720 --> 36:56.440
We're the kind of crazy that likes to not be lazy.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.800
How many inputs are on the back of your TV?

36:58.800 --> 37:01.760
I mean, seriously, you don't even need to hook up anything.

37:01.760 --> 37:06.280
You just plug them in to begin with, and oh, it's hooked up at the same time.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.920
I hit input on my remote, and wow!

37:09.920 --> 37:13.320
The power of PlayStation 2, brought to my TV!

37:13.320 --> 37:19.000
I think that my TV has something like three HDMI things, and then a bunch of AV, and like

37:19.000 --> 37:25.080
some S-video, and like the little one that you use the Switch for.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.080
Well that's nice.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.680
My TV's from Costco, so I don't think it probably has.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.760
Our TV is from Costco.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.340
That is not a valid excuse.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.640
I've rendered your excuse invalid.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.400
I swear my thing only has like two inputs, and an HDMI.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.400
Well yours sucks.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
You should return it.

37:39.400 --> 37:44.720
I'm sorry that your thing only has two inputs, that's why.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.720
Next story!

37:45.720 --> 37:46.720
Next topic.

37:46.720 --> 37:51.280
Well, how about, um, some more PS3 news.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.640
There is going to be a new system update 3.42.

37:53.640 --> 37:58.080
Why can't they just give them regular numbers instead of points, you know?

37:58.080 --> 38:00.440
Why can't it be update number four?

38:00.440 --> 38:01.440
Update number five?

38:01.440 --> 38:02.440
No.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.120
Because right now they'd be at update number 62.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.120
They're bitches.

38:05.120 --> 38:10.840
Because the whole number updates are for major, major, major updates, and this is just, hey,

38:10.840 --> 38:12.800
we're adding Blu-ray, or, you know.

38:12.800 --> 38:17.720
Well, the next one is 3.5, because we just got 3.42.

38:17.720 --> 38:25.320
And this one is going to add 3D Blu-ray movie support, since it can already do 3D with games.

38:25.320 --> 38:35.320
And that date is actually out for the Japanese market on September 21st, but I guess it's

38:35.320 --> 38:37.320
going to be after?

38:37.320 --> 38:41.840
And you'll be able to watch tens of movies with that.

38:41.840 --> 38:46.000
Or like, literally I think there's less than 20 movies out there that have 3D Blu-ray.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.800
Can I just say, fuck 3D.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.800
Like, I'm so over it.

38:50.800 --> 38:56.520
We actually have one of those 3D TVs and 3D Blu-rays at our work, because our Sony rep

38:56.520 --> 39:01.320
came in and we had this really nice Samsung TV up on the wall, and he's like, that's not

39:01.320 --> 39:02.320
a Sony TV.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
I'm getting you a Sony TV.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.320
And it's going to be a 3D TV.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.960
Tell your Sony rep to get me a TV.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.120
Do you watch Avatar?

39:08.120 --> 39:10.180
No, well, we can't.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.180
That's not 3D Blu-ray.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.040
Like, seriously, the only 3D-

39:13.040 --> 39:17.400
Because that will be in the super extended Uber James Cameron's cock Blu-ray edition.

39:17.400 --> 39:21.840
Well, okay, well, until then, though, all we have is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.

39:21.840 --> 39:25.180
That's like seriously the only damn movie that's in 3D.

39:25.180 --> 39:29.600
Which is also James Cameron's cock.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.600
Just by the way, don't-

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
His meaty balls.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.400
Cloudy with a Chance of Balls.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.800
Cameron balls.

39:35.800 --> 39:41.880
Don't watch Resident Evil Afterlife, and especially don't watch it in 3D.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.880
It was awesome.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.880
Why didn't you like that?

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
I want to see it.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.880
You're kidding, right?

39:45.880 --> 39:47.020
No, I liked it.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.020
You're being facetious.

39:48.020 --> 39:49.020
Tell me you're being facetious.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.020
Tell me.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.020
My head's gonna explode.

39:51.020 --> 39:52.020
No.

39:52.020 --> 39:55.960
But, no, that would be one of the only movies that I would actually want to go see in 3D,

39:55.960 --> 39:56.960
because you know it's gonna be ridiculous.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
You know?

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
Okay, did you go see it in 3D?

39:58.960 --> 40:00.840
It's just like going to an amusement park.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.840
Okay.

40:01.840 --> 40:02.840
What did you not like about it?

40:02.840 --> 40:07.200
Well, okay, the movie itself was fucking ridiculous and stupid.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.280
The 3D was obviously the added on 3D.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.280
It wasn't shot in 3D.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.280
It was shot in 3D.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
It was?

40:13.280 --> 40:14.280
Yeah.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.920
They actually, even when they were writing the script, they were writing with 3D in mind.

40:16.920 --> 40:20.000
When they were writing the script of Dawn of the Dead.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.960
They used the same cameras as Avatar did.

40:21.960 --> 40:22.960
It was this big deal.

40:22.960 --> 40:23.960
Wow.

40:23.960 --> 40:24.960
No, but, okay.

40:24.960 --> 40:25.960
That's cool.

40:25.960 --> 40:30.900
We actually, we went and saw that, I went and saw that actually on, uh, last week, um,

40:30.900 --> 40:31.900
with the D-Box seats.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.240
I don't know if you've heard about those.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.780
The motion seats that actually move and rumble and stuff.

40:35.780 --> 40:36.780
It was cool.

40:36.780 --> 40:37.780
Okay.

40:37.780 --> 40:38.780
Well, that might have added to it.

40:38.780 --> 40:39.780
And here's the thing, though.

40:39.780 --> 40:43.880
I don't really play the Resident Evil games, so for me, this movie is kind of like, hey,

40:43.880 --> 40:45.900
look, it's almost like The Matrix, but not, you know?

40:45.900 --> 40:50.000
So I don't know if the storyline ruined it for you, because I could, I couldn't care,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
you know?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Yes.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
The storyline was stupid.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.600
And, okay, the extent of the 3D stuff was just, oh, look at this blood flying in your

40:57.600 --> 40:58.600
face.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
Oh, look at this building.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.420
It's crumbling, and some of the crumbles are falling in your face.

41:02.420 --> 41:04.440
There was nothing, like, exciting about it.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.960
Maybe I'm just an old crotchety woman that doesn't like 3D, which is entirely possible.

41:07.960 --> 41:11.360
There was a lot of gimmicky stuff in there, like, a lot of, like, throwing stuff at the

41:11.360 --> 41:12.360
camera.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.600
Hey, I'm throwing my glasses at the camera.

41:14.600 --> 41:19.360
No, but that's, like, one of the only movies that I would go, okay, that's in 3D.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.360
That makes sense.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.360
But, like, Eat, Pray, Love.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.800
I mean, that doesn't need to be in 3D.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.800
Was that really in 3D?

41:24.800 --> 41:28.600
I'm gonna pray.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.840
And I was extending my folded hands forward.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.720
No, and just the movie itself was really stupid.

41:34.720 --> 41:39.560
Like, literally, it was Dawn of the Dead, except with, like, Resident Evil people.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.560
Oh, geez, spoilers.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.560
Oh, my God.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
You've seen it before.

41:42.560 --> 41:47.320
Didn't we go through this whole 3D craze back in the 80s, with, like, Jaws 3D?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.960
I don't know.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.440
I was, like, five.

41:50.440 --> 41:57.960
Well, I think, okay, right now, Sony, they were kind of bad for doing it.

41:57.960 --> 42:01.000
Before with, like, the PlayStation 3, when it first came out, it was, like, $600, and

42:01.000 --> 42:02.880
they're like, well, that's because that's Blu-ray in it.

42:02.880 --> 42:06.080
Well, everyone complained, I don't give a fuck, it's $600.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.680
I'm not buying it.

42:07.680 --> 42:11.320
It's because they're kind of jumping, they're trying to push the technology too much.

42:11.320 --> 42:16.680
Just like 3D TV, I'm glad you're supporting 3D with your games, and I'm glad you're supporting

42:16.680 --> 42:20.760
3D Blu-ray, because probably you have a little bit of an investment in it since, I don't

42:20.760 --> 42:28.000
know, you have a lot of Blu-ray stuff, you are your own movie company and whatnot.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.440
So obviously, they're trying to invest some of that in there, but it's really not viable

42:32.440 --> 42:39.880
now to buy a 3D TV or a 3D Blu-ray player, because there's hardly any content for it.

42:39.880 --> 42:44.200
And if you just wait, it's going to get damn cheaper anyways, and there's probably something

42:44.200 --> 42:45.200
better going to come out.

42:45.200 --> 42:49.280
You know, they're going to come out with TVs that don't require stupid glasses on you.

42:49.280 --> 42:52.640
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.840
Salacious Pop is in chat and follows up the comment about Eat, Pray, Love, and 3D, saying

42:56.840 --> 43:00.600
Julia Roberts' mouth in 3D would be a sin of technology.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.480
Ah, see, 3D bad.

43:04.480 --> 43:07.680
There's this picture I sometimes see on Oh No They Didn't, and somebody needs to link

43:07.680 --> 43:08.680
it in chat.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.080
I'm like, Alan, find this picture.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.720
It's like, it's a picture of Julia Roberts, but it's been photoshopped to really exaggerate

43:14.720 --> 43:16.080
her horse mouth.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.080
And it's really scary.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.200
Like, it makes her look like a zombie.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.600
Surety has an exaggerated horse mouth.

43:21.600 --> 43:22.600
I don't want to see the picture.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.600
It's so scary.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.600
No, don't do it, Alan.

43:24.600 --> 43:25.600
No.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.960
Somebody will find it for me.

43:26.960 --> 43:30.040
SSJ100Matt says, Rob's still waiting for Showgirls 3D.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.040
True story.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.040
Oh my God.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.960
Actually, you want to hear a true story?

43:33.960 --> 43:37.240
I bought Showgirls on Blu-ray this week for $18.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.240
It was on sale.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.240
Wow.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.240
That's awesome.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.240
I want to go watch it.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.240
We should have it.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.240
I should come over.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.240
We should have a Showgirls party.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.240
Let's do it.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.240
I want to watch the TV version.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.240
And we'll have brown rice and vegetables, Rob.

43:49.240 --> 43:52.680
We'll have a whole little Showgirls party.

43:52.680 --> 43:53.680
It'll be fun.

43:53.680 --> 43:54.680
Yay.

43:54.680 --> 43:55.680
Ah.

43:55.680 --> 43:59.200
That is seriously a movie that needs to be in 3D, though.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.200
And...

44:00.200 --> 44:01.200
Eat, Pray, Love.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.200
No, not Eat, Pray, Love.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.200
Showgirls.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.200
Well, actually, not even.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.200
Yeah, yeah.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.200
Showgirls.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.200
No one wants to see that movie.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.320
I want Saved by the Bell 3D, then.

44:10.320 --> 44:14.840
No, because they had, was it the Piranha 3D or whatever, and they had a whole bunch of

44:14.840 --> 44:18.360
like, oh, it's a wet t-shirt contest, you know, type of stuff.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.000
So we need more of that with less of the piranhas.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.280
I mean, the piranhas are cool and all, but I mean, you don't need to mix them both together.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.280
Yeah.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.880
Like, Nomi's nipples are going to be coming out into your face.

44:27.880 --> 44:32.100
But can you imagine, you know, the really weird thrash sex she was doing?

44:32.100 --> 44:33.340
You know that in 3D?

44:33.340 --> 44:34.340
That'd be some scary stuff.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.480
That would be scary.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
People would be like, ah.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.480
What the fuck is that?

44:37.480 --> 44:38.480
You gonna die?

44:38.480 --> 44:39.480
Watch.

44:39.480 --> 44:42.480
I know what's happening in this movie.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.480
You gonna die.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
Ah.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.480
Rob, close it now.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.480
I hate it.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.480
Ah.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.480
Ah.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
Ah.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
Times a million.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.480
No.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.480
I found the picture I was looking for.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.480
Or one of them.

44:53.480 --> 44:54.480
Oh, my God.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.480
Hold on.

44:55.480 --> 44:56.480
This is terrible radio.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.960
Let me leave this nerd shack.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.240
What is going on?

44:59.240 --> 45:02.600
I don't know, but I lost the don't shit my pants game.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.480
Why is that like, Enzite guy there?

45:05.480 --> 45:06.480
No.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
Okay.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.480
I just.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.480
Cover it up.

45:09.480 --> 45:10.480
Cover it up with that window.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.480
Move it, Rob.

45:11.480 --> 45:12.480
Don't.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.480
Ah.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.480
Just Google.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
Okay.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.480
Or not Google.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.480
Go to photo bucket.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.480
Because they let you search your pictures and search for Julia Roberts.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.480
Gif.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
Gif.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
Julia Roberts.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
Gif.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.480
And it will come right up.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
It's like the first image.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
It's hilarious.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
Oh, my God.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.480
Let's see.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.480
Um.

45:28.480 --> 45:33.320
Spazinator PSN says, I wouldn't mind seeing Angelina Jolie's boobs in 3D.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.840
Just saying.

45:34.840 --> 45:38.800
You know, wanted might have been kind of cool in 3D, because they tried to do some 3D ish

45:38.800 --> 45:39.800
kind of things in that.

45:39.800 --> 45:41.020
I could see that working.

45:41.020 --> 45:46.640
You know, with a movie like that, that's just like this movie is like so hetero.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.640
It's dick has a dick like type of thing.

45:48.640 --> 45:49.640
Yeah.

45:49.640 --> 45:50.640
That's weird.

45:50.640 --> 45:51.640
That's not very hetero right there.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.240
I would not fuck a dick that had a dick.

45:53.240 --> 45:55.240
That would be awkward.

45:55.240 --> 46:00.440
Yeah, I'm like, I gotta go now away from your dick.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.860
You know what I mean, though?

46:01.860 --> 46:02.860
I guess.

46:02.860 --> 46:07.320
That would be weird if, like, the bullets went around your face in 3D.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.720
I almost got shot.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.240
Yeah.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.240
You know what I'm going to do?

46:12.240 --> 46:17.760
I'm going to post that Julia Roberts gift to our Twitter and just see what we're past.

46:17.760 --> 46:21.160
I'm going to see who's not listening to the show right now by seeing the responses we

46:21.160 --> 46:22.160
get.

46:22.160 --> 46:23.160
Okay.

46:23.160 --> 46:27.120
And in the meantime, did it work that at that?

46:27.120 --> 46:33.120
So, back to the Doctor and the Princess Show.

46:33.120 --> 46:39.120
Well, now that we're done with that topic, let's talk about Halo Reach and its shortcomings.

46:39.120 --> 46:43.960
Halo Reach is an awesome game, but somebody didn't test it well enough, and that somebody

46:43.960 --> 46:50.000
would be Microsoft, because Halo Reach has problems playing on the brand new 4GB Xbox

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
360 slimmer system.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.760
It's funny, because apparently co-op requires a hard drive in order to work, which is dumb

46:58.760 --> 47:01.120
to begin with.

47:01.120 --> 47:08.000
The 4GB of storage that's on those new systems is kind of classified as a memory unit.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.880
So therefore, despite the fact that you have adequate space to store whatever files they

47:12.880 --> 47:18.080
want you to store, it still won't let you play co-op.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.460
And same with USB memory sticks.

47:20.460 --> 47:21.600
Those also don't count.

47:21.600 --> 47:26.000
Those are still thumb drives or memory sticks or whatever.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.040
That's not a hard drive.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.040
Not close enough.

47:28.040 --> 47:33.680
So you're still going to have to play solo or play online.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.400
You have to play with yourself.

47:35.400 --> 47:39.480
Apparently though, Microsoft has said that they're aware of the issue, and this is going

47:39.480 --> 47:40.560
to be a temporary issue.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.720
The company is working to resolve it.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.720
But seriously, come on, man.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.920
That should have been something that you should have tested first.

47:46.920 --> 47:51.040
Let's try playing this on each of our SKUs, especially the ones that have just come out,

47:51.040 --> 47:54.440
and let's see if it works correctly.

47:54.440 --> 48:00.520
On one of the biggest games for our company, that might be important to do.

48:00.520 --> 48:02.520
Just a little bit.

48:02.520 --> 48:08.200
Or maybe they're just trying to upsell those bigger console bundles.

48:08.200 --> 48:13.160
Let me buy your stupid 4GB system and then I have to buy your really expensive hard drive

48:13.160 --> 48:18.900
to plug into it because normal hard drives won't work, despite the fact that it's a normal

48:18.900 --> 48:22.960
hard drive, but formatted differently.

48:22.960 --> 48:23.960
Fun.

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
Totally.

48:24.960 --> 48:31.640
Why can't you just allow anybody to put their own hard drives in there?

48:31.640 --> 48:32.640
Just like Sony.

48:32.640 --> 48:37.400
At least they have that going for them.

48:37.400 --> 48:41.520
Alright well I'm going to move on to another story here about a website called Good Old

48:41.520 --> 48:46.080
Games and a lot of interesting developments that's going on today.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.960
After hearing about the developments I kind of hesitate even bringing up this story on

48:48.960 --> 48:52.960
the show in the first place, but it's kind of bold what's going on.

48:52.960 --> 48:57.880
Well Good Old Games is a website located at GOG.com and we brought them up on the show

48:57.880 --> 48:58.880
before.

48:58.880 --> 49:04.280
It's a website where you can buy old games like the King's Quest series and just like

49:04.280 --> 49:10.480
old PC games from back in the day for like 5 bucks or 10 bucks and it's all DRM free.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.620
Like Fallout 2, just older PC games.

49:13.620 --> 49:16.480
So it's kind of like legalized abandonware basically.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.640
For companies that still want to sell their old games.

49:18.640 --> 49:24.320
Well they shut down today and posted a notice on their website that says, we recently had

49:24.320 --> 49:28.540
to give serious thought as to whether we could really keep GOG.com going the way it is.

49:28.540 --> 49:32.380
We've debated on it for quite some time and unfortunately we've decided that GOG.com simply

49:32.380 --> 49:33.800
cannot remain in its current form.

49:33.800 --> 49:39.440
So the website, a lot of news sites kind of post about this, oh this is such a good idea,

49:39.440 --> 49:44.000
made this thing legal and you know it was good karma to buy the games and stuff and

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
now they've shut down.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.080
Oh it's a bummer to see them go.

49:47.080 --> 49:53.880
But now it's coming out today, did they really shut down or is this all a marketing ploy?

49:53.880 --> 49:58.360
And that is apparently the latest news that is coming out is that this is actually a marketing

49:58.360 --> 50:06.240
ploy about their change from the beta version of GOG.com to the full version of GOG.com.

50:06.240 --> 50:12.560
And in an article that Kotaku ran, they actually got an update from spokesman Tom Ohle, O-H-L-E,

50:12.560 --> 50:13.560
Ohle?

50:13.560 --> 50:14.560
Ohle?

50:14.560 --> 50:19.560
Well he's kind of an a-hole if this whole thing turns out to be true, saying quote,

50:19.560 --> 50:24.520
as the message on the site says, this doesn't mean that GOG is gone, we'll have more to

50:24.520 --> 50:26.160
share in the coming days.

50:26.160 --> 50:30.240
It's kind of bootsy, I don't like that.

50:30.240 --> 50:34.580
It's just, here's the thing, and I even commented this on my Twitter when this whole thing was

50:34.580 --> 50:38.920
going on, it was like, you know, more people are talking about GOG.com today than they

50:38.920 --> 50:42.440
probably ever did during its run, and it's kind of one of those, well you know they had

50:42.440 --> 50:45.760
a good idea, but if they weren't really selling the games, how are they going to really stay

50:45.760 --> 50:46.760
in business?

50:46.760 --> 50:50.320
You know it's kind of a bummer that people decided to start carrying today.

50:50.320 --> 50:53.800
Well what's interesting is that now the whole thing might have actually been a media hoax.

50:53.800 --> 50:58.280
So on one hand you got to kind of go, lol, that's funny, good job, you got the press.

50:58.280 --> 51:02.280
But on the other hand, to your loyal customers who are kind of freaking out about, are the

51:02.280 --> 51:05.840
games I bought still going to work, how am I going to re-download these games, you know

51:05.840 --> 51:09.840
your core fan base is going to feel a little bit used after something like this.

51:09.840 --> 51:13.480
So it's like, yes you get the exposure, but at what cost?

51:13.480 --> 51:15.680
I felt very used on Rob's network.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.800
Have you ever bought a game on GOG?

51:17.800 --> 51:20.720
I didn't think so.

51:20.720 --> 51:28.040
Yeah, Spassinator PSN in our chat room says, good ol' games, bad ol' decisions.

51:28.040 --> 51:33.120
That could be accurate.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.120
You alright?

51:34.120 --> 51:35.120
Yes!

51:35.120 --> 51:36.120
Nothing happened at all.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.120
Yes, we're good over here.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.120
Good, good to hear it.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.120
The core definitely didn't fall out of the microphone.

51:40.120 --> 51:42.120
Nope, nope, it stayed intact.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.120
Wow.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.960
Loki, what do you think?

51:44.960 --> 51:48.400
I know you probably weren't a big advocate of this site in the first place, but what

51:48.400 --> 51:50.200
do you think about this as a marketing trick?

51:50.200 --> 51:52.880
As a marketing trick?

51:52.880 --> 51:55.840
That's cool that we're all talking about you, and then when you come back you're like,

51:55.840 --> 51:59.600
ah, no, we're not really going away, everyone's like, okay, no, we're not talking about you

51:59.600 --> 52:01.840
anymore, no one cares.

52:01.840 --> 52:06.320
I think it's, in terms of marketing, because keep in mind there is no such thing as bad

52:06.320 --> 52:10.280
press really, it gets people talking.

52:10.280 --> 52:15.760
Here's my suggestion, and I know there's a handful of sites out there that listen to

52:15.760 --> 52:20.760
our show, for inspiration I'm sure, not to trash us on their blog every week, but here's

52:20.760 --> 52:26.080
the thing, if you cover the story about them shutting down, and you want to really get

52:26.080 --> 52:30.100
revenge on these guys and their little marketing tricks, and how they're using you basically

52:30.100 --> 52:34.760
to get free advertising for their site, cover the story about them shutting down, and don't

52:34.760 --> 52:37.120
cover the story about them reopening.

52:37.120 --> 52:42.960
And then punch them in the dick, and the guy will be like, ole, my dick.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.760
If you want.

52:44.760 --> 52:50.280
But no, seriously, because if nobody covers the story about them reopening.

52:50.280 --> 52:54.680
Then this little marketing thing kind of bit them in the ass, didn't it?

52:54.680 --> 52:56.280
Food for thought.

52:56.280 --> 53:01.640
I know if I ran a website such as the aforementioned Kotaku or Joystiq, I just wouldn't run, I

53:01.640 --> 53:08.360
would say, you know, I'm not your little press release releasing bitch, so I'm not writing

53:08.360 --> 53:11.620
the story about you guys reopening or launching the new site.

53:11.620 --> 53:13.760
Good luck getting the press on that one.

53:13.760 --> 53:14.760
P.S.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.040
You suck.

53:16.040 --> 53:21.760
And some quotes in our chat room, MXT says GOG has died, SEG says GOG had jumped the

53:21.760 --> 53:24.520
shark, and Spazinator says more like fuck the shark.

53:24.520 --> 53:29.800
I'm actually not sure exactly how one fucks the shark as opposed to jumping over it.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.480
It's like, aye, aye.

53:32.480 --> 53:33.640
Wow, Rob.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.880
Bend over, shark.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.840
That doesn't show your age.

53:37.840 --> 53:41.000
Dark Sakura, please, won't you help us change the subject?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.080
There are other subjects, definitely.

53:43.080 --> 53:48.480
It was spoken, actually, it came up on Twitter.

53:48.480 --> 53:55.480
Katsuhiro Harada, who is the Tekken director guy, he posted on Twitter, TGS September 18th

53:55.480 --> 54:03.000
at Togeki booth, I'll announce something, colon D. Smile face.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.200
And we actually don't know what it is yet.

54:06.200 --> 54:09.880
It's Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

54:09.880 --> 54:13.240
Sorry.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.840
Yeah.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.720
Are you not excited about Tekken Tag Tournament 2?

54:17.720 --> 54:20.120
I wasn't excited about the first Tekken Tag Tournament.

54:20.120 --> 54:23.400
No, I think that's what it ended up being, yeah, he's right.

54:23.400 --> 54:26.800
You know I still have to play it, because it's Tekken.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.800
Sorry.

54:27.800 --> 54:32.960
Well, I mean, wasn't there like, in the 3D Street Fighter series, didn't you like, not

54:32.960 --> 54:35.160
like the first game but the second one was okay?

54:35.160 --> 54:36.160
Things like that?

54:36.160 --> 54:37.160
In the EX ones?

54:37.160 --> 54:38.160
Yeah.

54:38.160 --> 54:43.320
They're alright, I'm just not a big fan of the Tekken Tag series, I mean, did they make

54:43.320 --> 54:44.640
it better than the first one?

54:44.640 --> 54:48.400
Whoa, your mic cut out, sorry, I didn't even realize we just had big dead air, sorry about

54:48.400 --> 54:49.400
that.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
LAH!

54:50.400 --> 54:51.400
Okay.

54:51.400 --> 54:52.400
So Tekken Tag.

54:52.400 --> 54:56.400
Tekken Tag, if it's better than the first one, then yeah, I won't be disappointed, but

54:56.400 --> 55:00.440
I don't know, the first one was really not all that great, except for Tekken Bowl.

55:00.440 --> 55:04.480
Well, here's my thoughts on it, that it's probably just gonna be, since they're developing

55:04.480 --> 55:12.160
a tag team tournament, you know, sort of engine for, you know, Tekken X Capcom, you know,

55:12.160 --> 55:16.660
the Namco version of that, it'll probably just be based off that, except it's not gonna

55:16.660 --> 55:19.200
have any Capcom characters in it.

55:19.200 --> 55:24.360
Which, if you ask me, is kind of lame, because, you know, when you play Tekken X Capcom, you're

55:24.360 --> 55:28.000
just, you're gonna want to play that game versus, you know, the other one anyways, so.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
It's sort of like, what's the point?

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Uh, yeah.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
It is.

55:33.000 --> 55:42.000
And apparently, that game will be hitting Japanese arcades in 2011, and it is an updated,

55:42.000 --> 55:47.960
I guess, it is a follow-up, of course, to 1999's arcade original, updated with new roster,

55:47.960 --> 55:53.360
and current gen graphics engine, doesn't say that the US version has been announced yet,

55:53.360 --> 55:56.400
but they have a nice little teaser trailer that's up right now.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.040
Well, you know they're gonna have a US version.

55:58.040 --> 56:01.600
Well, I mean, if this is an arcade game, that's kind of good news, I guess.

56:01.600 --> 56:05.400
We've had some, a few stories in the past few weeks about good news for arcade games,

56:05.400 --> 56:06.400
you know?

56:06.400 --> 56:10.040
Like, they're getting some things that the consoles actually don't have just yet, although,

56:10.040 --> 56:13.480
it's probably inevitable this comes out for consoles as well, but.

56:13.480 --> 56:19.960
Well, I hope it does, but I would really like to see, um, if it did get an arcade release

56:19.960 --> 56:21.600
in the US, you know I'd play it.

56:21.600 --> 56:26.980
Like I said, I don't think if it does come out console, or if it does come out, uh, yeah,

56:26.980 --> 56:30.600
console-wise, it's not gonna take that long to port it over, because, like I said, they're

56:30.600 --> 56:38.920
building an engine already for, uh, the, you know, Tekken Cross Capcom game, so, uh, or

56:38.920 --> 56:40.320
Street Fighter, I guess.

56:40.320 --> 56:44.080
It's, it's gonna be the same damn engine, I know it.

56:44.080 --> 56:47.920
SSG-100 Matt in our chatroom says it actually looks like the same system as Tekken Cross

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
Capcom, so.

56:48.920 --> 56:52.920
Yeah, and that, see, that's the sad thing, though, is since, you know, they have that

56:52.920 --> 56:57.500
game coming out, it's like, uh, you know, I could play that game, but I'd rather play

56:57.500 --> 57:02.120
the Capcom one, or the, not the Capcom, the Street Fighter one, because it's got, you

57:02.120 --> 57:05.560
know, more variety of characters, you know, and now you have this one.

57:05.560 --> 57:09.080
I just hope they don't put it, bring it out in console, just leave it in the arcade or

57:09.080 --> 57:10.080
something.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.520
But put all the characters, though, in, you know, the Street Fighter one, too, so that'd

57:12.520 --> 57:13.520
be kinda cool.

57:13.520 --> 57:16.240
Alright, let's travel around the world and talk about some games that are coming out

57:16.240 --> 57:18.600
a whole lot sooner than Tekken Tag Tournament.

57:18.600 --> 57:22.960
Uh, this week, not a whole lot coming out in the US, uh, it's actually pretty light,

57:22.960 --> 57:24.480
but next week it'll be pretty nice.

57:24.480 --> 57:28.800
Um, starting off, though, this week we have Swords on the Wii, it is a sword fighting

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
game.

57:29.800 --> 57:34.560
Uh, looks like a re-release of a game called Chicken Blaster, with a stupid shotgun with

57:34.560 --> 57:35.560
that.

57:35.560 --> 57:36.560
Fun.

57:36.560 --> 57:37.560
Uh.

57:37.560 --> 57:38.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

57:38.560 --> 57:39.840
Is it a chicken fighting game?

57:39.840 --> 57:41.440
One more time, please.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.800
Chicken Blaster on the Wii, and it comes with a shotgun?

57:44.800 --> 57:47.240
Yeah, a little shotgun attachment.

57:47.240 --> 57:48.240
Yeah.

57:48.240 --> 57:49.240
Okay, okay.

57:49.240 --> 57:52.480
It's a really small shotgun, I, I know, I know, oh, okay.

57:52.480 --> 57:56.520
The doctor dare says that Wii gaming is dead.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.520
How could you?

57:57.520 --> 57:58.520
You're wrong, sir.

57:58.520 --> 57:59.520
How could you?

57:59.520 --> 58:00.520
You are wrong.

58:00.520 --> 58:01.520
You just need Chicken Shooter.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.520
Chicken Blaster, okay.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.520
Chicken Shoot was the first game.

58:03.520 --> 58:04.520
Chicken Blaster with your small shotgun.

58:04.520 --> 58:05.520
Get it right.

58:05.520 --> 58:10.240
Um, Sid Meier's Civilization V coming out on PC.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.240
Yay.

58:11.240 --> 58:22.440
Uh, new carnival games on the DS and the Wii, uh, yay, um, looks like, what is it, um, World

58:22.440 --> 58:35.080
Golf 2011, that's also on PC, um, Patrician, I think that's, Patrician IV on PC, I have

58:35.080 --> 58:40.980
no idea what the hell that is, uh, Formula One 2010, coming from, well, what was formerly

58:40.980 --> 58:46.560
Codemasters, now Warner Home Video Games, that's on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this

58:46.560 --> 58:52.160
week, uh, let's see.

58:52.160 --> 58:56.720
Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue on the DS, a tie-in with the new one coming out.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.720
Yay.

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
Whoopty shit.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.720
Uh.

58:59.720 --> 59:02.520
Come on, OLR listeners, how many of you bought Fancy Nancy last week, that's what I want

59:02.520 --> 59:03.520
to know.

59:03.520 --> 59:04.520
Chirp, chirp.

59:04.520 --> 59:10.680
Ah, Sony, once again, not quite getting it, but High Velocity Bowling for Playstation 3.

59:10.680 --> 59:15.420
High Velocity Bowling, yes, you may remember this as the Playstation Network title that

59:15.420 --> 59:20.760
came out originally at $10, probably now $5, but hey, guess what, you're gonna pay $40

59:20.760 --> 59:21.760
for this one now.

59:21.760 --> 59:22.760
This one has move support, right?

59:22.760 --> 59:26.800
It does have move support, but I think the old one was getting patched for move support,

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
I think.

59:27.800 --> 59:31.680
I could be wrong, but, uh, that would be ironic if that was the case.

59:31.680 --> 59:38.320
Um, Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allen Poe conspiracy, for the DS.

59:38.320 --> 59:39.320
What?

59:39.320 --> 59:40.320
Farm Frenzy?

59:40.320 --> 59:43.560
You know what, I was about to make the same joke I know I made on this show, like, four

59:43.560 --> 59:47.160
weeks ago, so this game had to have gotten pushed back, because I was gonna say, I will

59:47.160 --> 59:49.680
buy that game, quote the raven, nevermore.

59:49.680 --> 59:50.680
No!

59:50.680 --> 59:54.640
I know I made that joke four weeks ago, and you all groaned then, too.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.640
I'm leaving.

59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.800
Uh, Farm Frenzy Animal Country, yay, ah, that's for the DS.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:08.320
Club Penguin Game Day for the Wii, um, Gormiti the Lords of Nature, thank you, Konami, for

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.160
this wonderful game on the DS and the Wii, and I'm being sarcastic, it's not wonderful

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.080
at all, uh, Jewels of the Tropical Lost Island.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.920
God, this game list is shitty as fuck, man.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.160
This is the great thing, is that, low-key, like, whenever we do the US release dates,

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.520
it'll be like, yeah, you know, Halo's coming out this week, and then we have on the DS,

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:34.360
Fancy Nancy, and, uh, looks like we've got Jewel Questathon, and Chicken Shoot's coming

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.360
out on the Wii!

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.040
No, but that's my point, though, I've been waiting for, like, two years for, like, good

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.080
games to start coming out on the Wii again, and I'm like, okay, Zelda's coming out next

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080
year.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.640
You know what, you can come over and play Tatsunoko vs. Capcom with me.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.680
That's not, well, that's on the Wii, yeah, I played that.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680
That's a fun game.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.680
That's about epic yarn.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.240
Well, that's not out yet, see, that's what I mean, that's not out yet, and that looks

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.800
like a good game, shut up, that does not sound like Fancy Nancy.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.520
But before that, Wii Party.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.040
Did you see that they actually got the idea for the Kirby game from an old Kirby commercial

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.800
that Nintendo had made using yarn?

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.520
There is some decent stuff coming out this week, and we're also going to end with some

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:17.520
crappy stuff, um, as if we haven't already, um, was it, uh, Etrian Odyssey 3, the Drowned

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:23.160
City on DS, that's a pretty good RPG from, um, Atlus.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.800
Final Fantasy XIV, the collector's edition, coming out on PC this week.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.520
I think you get that earlier than the regular version, I guess that's special.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.280
Wait, and how much, how much are you going to pay for Final Fantasy XIV to play it early?

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280
Seventy-five dollars.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.280
Good lord, that's a lot of money.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:52.120
Also, uh, also this week, Darksiders, uh, on PC, and, um, and I believe that's it.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.000
Alright, uh, before we go to Japan, let's go to the, and their release dates, let's

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.720
go to, uh, some of the comments in our chatroom at chat.orangeslauncerated.com, um, Spazinator

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.240
PSN says, wait, wait, wait, did Sky just say chicken shitter?

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240
What the fuck?

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.320
Actually, that game would probably be a whole lot more interesting, um, yeah, chicken shitter.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.440
Mark Toagak says, Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.300
Can I take a tangent for a minute?

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:20.080
Tangent train, absolutely, 100%, has nothing to do with video games whatsoever, but it

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.440
does have to do with strippers.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.440
Okay, yes, you can.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.820
So, I went out clubbing last night with Alan and we met, you know, some mutual friends

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:33.240
and met up for dinner and went to one of the bars downtown and we were sitting at a bar,

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.000
a table that is right by the window, so you can look out onto the street and see what's

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
going on.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.520
And we watched this, there's a really popular gay bar across the street where all the little

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.980
like circuit boys and all their little, you know, the women that want to go see the horny

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.980
guys and stuff.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.560
That's, that's the club they all go to that I outgrew many, many, many years ago.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.560
I know what you're talking about.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560
Yes.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560
You know exactly which place I'm talking about.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.240
Anyone who lives in Sacramento knows what club I'm talking about.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.860
So we are sitting at the place across the street looking out the window and we see this

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:12.440
gigantic bus pull up in front of it and inside the bus is like all these disco lights and

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.520
like green neon lights going on and we look carefully in the bus.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.360
There's a stripper pole inside the bus.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.360
That's awesome.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.040
And I'm like, what in the hell is that?

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.080
And my friend speaks up and I don't remember if it was Alan or my friend says, oh, it's

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.280
one of those stripper buses.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.340
I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.340
They have that now?

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:37.560
They have traveling, like put on your seatbelt, strap herself to the pole.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
How does that rock?

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
What?

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560
It's not a stripper bus.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560
It's a limo bus.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:48.800
And the reason we, this is funny, uh, we last week, um, we did our game summit thing and

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.920
we, one of the days we went out, uh, they took us to a few wineries and they did wine

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920
tasting.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.240
Well, they had two different limo buses, they had a shorter one and then they had a larger

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240
one.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.160
And the other one had a stripper pole in the back.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.600
So it's just, it's just a bus, but I mean, hold on, hold on.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.640
We need, if we're going to talk about party bus, we need party bus music.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640
Brilliant.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640
I approve.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.820
So yeah, so they do have a stripper pole in the back and I suppose if you were to rent

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.680
it, say for a bachelor party or something, you could have strippers performing.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:28.880
Now granted, it might not be the safest thing for them to be doing, but, uh, sure, why not?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:35.800
So finally the lights go on in this bus and there's like, I shit you not, like 50 drunk

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.400
chicks all piled in this bus and like, it's like, it's like the lights went onto the club

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.720
at 2am and they all just start pouring out the front of the bus and go on into a little

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.280
gay club.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.920
And that's why I stopped going to that club also, Rob, because every Friday and Saturday

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.920
night it's like, let's let all the straights in.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.320
And there was like two gay people there and I was like, what is going on?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:10.360
I haven't been there in like six years now.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.720
I'm sorry, but I would just, I was just fascinated.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.200
Like what if that bus, I mean that bus was a big bus and it was taking up an entire lane

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.560
and surely it doesn't turn well.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.560
And I'm just thinking like, what if that bus gets in an accident?

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:28.720
You're going to have just drunk chicks pouring out the windshield.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.640
They won't know because they're drunk.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.760
So it doesn't matter.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.560
That is a, that is a terrible thing.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.680
Having a bunch of drunk chicks inside of a bus with the stripper pole, geez, that would

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.680
suck.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.000
Well, and then all the skanky slutty twink boys that you were nice enough to call the

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.520
circuit boys, all the skanky slutty snotty twink boys that are faces won't even know

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.400
because they'll just be like, whatever.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.640
I like how I went out of my way to not give the clubs names and then you're just like,

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.240
uh, Oh, this is interesting.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240
Okay.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.520
Tiger call linked us a picture here in chat of a stripper bus.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.160
This must be in Nevada.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.160
It's one of the advertisement.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160
Yeah.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160
Yeah.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.600
That's, it was close to that though.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.760
It was close to that, but it looked a little bit more like a regular stripper bus that

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.440
looks like a billboard, a regular stripper bus or a regular bus making distinctions between

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.440
types of buses.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.440
Anyhow, interesting.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.720
Okay.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.520
We should go to Japanese release date stripper pole.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.240
That's just a pole so that you don't fall over.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.520
You hold onto it, you know, in lieu of a seatbelt, you know, let's go to the Japanese release

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.720
dates, but we're going to make them a little more interesting tonight.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.720
That's going to read them in Korean.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:50.080
Here come your Japanese release dates.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.600
Devil May Cry 4 gets a price reduction in Japan, September 22nd, Singularity makes its

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:01.600
way out to the Xbox 360 in Japan at of course being the localized version of the Activision

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.760
game that I believe came out here a little while ago, the party keeps on rolling onto

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.160
the PlayStation three at some point.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.320
Hey, there's a lot of games coming out on the Xbox 360 PlayStation three gets Devil

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:20.400
May Cry four price reduction there as well and Singularity as well as winning post seven

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
2010.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400
Good times.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.400
Wow.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400
I know.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.920
I have my pre-order on that right now.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:36.000
On the Nintendo Wii out in Japan this week, we have, it looks like nothing.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.840
What a surprise on the PlayStation two.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840
Also nothing.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.120
How about on the Nintendo DS?

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.880
There's a game called Jacka Jacka music comes out this week.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880
Whoa.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:54.840
Are you sure that's not jack Jacka Jacka music.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.200
I got your Jacka Jacka music right here.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.440
Excuse me.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.400
I'll be right back.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.160
What the hell is Jacka Jacka music?

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.160
Tell me.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.280
I don't know, but I'm going to go Jacka Jacka all night long.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.880
I'm trying to look at the music or the, it looks like it's just showing you chords and

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.640
this looks really boring.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.640
I think I'd fall asleep.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640
I get it.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:33.080
If you Jacka Jacka before bed, you'll fall asleep easier.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:44.600
And then on the Sony PSP this week, do rah, rah, rah, I shit you not, that's the name

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.600
of the game.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.080
Do rah, rah, rah, three way standoff.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:09:06.040
Whoa, three way, wow, Rob's having a moment comes out this week and there's three way

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.600
action here.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.020
It always is experimental.

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.360
There's other PSP games coming out, but I'm done.

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.000
They're not doing rah, rah, rah.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.520
No, you're not done.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.780
I closed it.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.780
That's okay.

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:23.320
Cause I have a good name for you, Rob, for something that comes in on the 22nd death

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:28.800
spank thongs of virtue for our UK releases.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.840
The chatters are pointing out do rah, rah, rah as an anime.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:32.840
Yes.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:41.560
So about three way sex amongst school children on the 24th we have blue dragon awakened shadow

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:49.560
on the DS dark siders for PC dead rising to guitar hero warriors of rock, um, lost horizon

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.560
quantum theory.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:56.000
I just liked that name, quantum theory, Sid Meyer, civilization five for PC and test drive

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:06.520
unlimited two and track mania two all for PC, Ooh, Navy seals.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.520
All right.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.920
Are we ready to get back into some gaming news?

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.920
Why not?

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.920
Yes.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.680
This is coming from the show because again, because, um, Alan said I have to play this

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.400
link on air cause it has to do with the stripper bus.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.400
Okay.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.800
So this is a video from the onion.com.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.120
Oh God, I only know where this is going to go again.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.440
This is coming from the onion.com.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:31.200
Uh, let me, let me stop you real quick because you did miss once and she didn't want to talk

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.200
about it.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.200
What I missed stuff.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.720
Um, there is a Ryoga, uh, gotoku, uh, shin show.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.960
Um, it's, it's the, uh, Oh, great.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.840
And now I can't remember the damn title.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.840
Uh, the Yakuza on the PSP came out this week as well.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.840
That's a little bit of a big title for Japan.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.200
Can I talk about the stripper bus again?

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.040
Talk about the stripper bus.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.280
If you're just joining us, we are covering a developing story.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.240
We go back now to Southern California where a VH1 bus crashed just a short while ago,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.800
revealing more than 2000 pounds of slot on the interstate five-year Palmdale.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.240
The bus was transporting contestants for the new VH1 reality series, the road to Knoxville

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.880
in which 18 scantily clad young women vie for the heart of divorce stuntman Johnny Knoxville

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.640
officials there are struggling to control the spread of slot, which has already polluted

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.360
the roadway and is spreading now down a Hillside into residential areas.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.120
Let's go live to onion news networks.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.720
Brian Scott, who's live on the scene, Brian, what's exactly going on out there?

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.720
Well, it's just horrible.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.160
Anna, the highway here was not pristine to begin with, but now it's covered in all of

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.680
this orange skinned slot.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.960
I've only been here an hour.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:48.440
I've already seen four three way kisses and six tattoos with misspellings and downwind

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.240
the stench of perfume and tequila mixed together is pretty difficult to stomach.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.400
It sounds like quite a scene.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.320
Brian, I understand that the sluts had been loaded onto the bus in Huntington beach early

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320
this morning.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320
Is that right?

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
That's where it began.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.320
Yes.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.560
The sluts were being transported from a negligee wearing rock climbing contest there to a girl

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.280
on girl paintball match when the crash occurred.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280
There's speculation.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.280
In fact, the accident was actually caused by some slut leaking into the front cab on

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.160
the vehicle and getting on the drive and see now the local fire department is just not

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.280
equipped to handle something this toxic.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.640
The problem is that we're very close to the San Gabriel river and officials are concerned

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.640
that the sluts might go skinny dipping in it or think it's a hot tub and make out in

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640
it.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.640
We should say to the crews, they're doing their best.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.480
They're just trying to keep these sluts contained with impromptu strip offs and shooter contests

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
in the ditch.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
Finally.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.360
Now we've just gotten word that VH1 issued a statement.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.440
It's on their website.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.280
It says they are fully committed to the safe handling of sluts, but the EPA has urged VH1

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.600
to use perhaps a more diluted form of slut than this highly concentrated slut they use

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
now.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600
Yeah.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.280
Sounds, uh, sounds like good stuff, but I don't think VH1 is gonna ever go for that.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.720
Brian, stay safe out there and don't fuck any of those sluts.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.720
All right, thanks.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.720
Moving on.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:01.040
A new Apple laptop become preloaded with a half written coming of age knob.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.480
I fucking love the onion.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.480
Did you see the one they did about, you have to understand that was what we saw last night.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.240
No, I just right here in Sacramento.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.240
Okay.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240
Rob, we get it.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.240
Just say it.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240
Okay.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240
I love the onion too.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.240
Me too.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.840
Do you see the one about the impending, uh, a flood from Folsom dam and then creating

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:26.520
the Memorial for it and talking to the first person who dies in the flood.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.000
Actually, you know what's funny, Matt and I, the, the old apartment we lived at, I mean,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.080
we can say this now cause we don't live there anymore.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.200
We used to live in an apartment, the old studio.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.800
This was the studio from about episodes, what about 50 to probably like 150 were taped at

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.800
the apartment.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.140
We're looking, I used to live together, which was right next to Folsom dam.

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.160
We live in this little apartment complex was literally right next to it.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.760
And you know, if that dam ever broke, we'd be looking down on all the people getting

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.160
flooded out cause we were on top of the Hill.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.160
Ah, good one.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160
Rob.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.840
You're so you have so much concern for other people.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840
Hey, video games.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840
Yeah.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840
Loki.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840
Yes.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840
Help.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.840
Let's talk about games.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:14.200
Um, Nielsen, uh, the wonderful agency that talks about, you know, different ads and you

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.840
know, entertainment trends.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:22.680
Uh, they did a study of the six EA sports titles, um, including NHL 10 and be a live

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:31.040
or nine, um, that had in game ad advertisements in them and a guess, um, apparently they increased

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.280
household dollars, um, spent on, um, different things by 24%.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.940
Uh, one of them that they looked at was Gatorade and that was, uh, I guess the case there.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940
It's interesting.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.600
I don't, I don't know.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.760
I don't buy that people, you know, they see Gatorade on a billboard in the background

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.560
that they're going to really go and buy Gatorade.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:59.320
I think a lot of players that play sports games for a long period of time, maybe perhaps

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.640
like drinking, you know, Gatorade or soda or whatever, and it's just a coincidence if

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640
you ask me.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:12.160
But, um, apparently they have a press release out and, uh, summarizing the different things,

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.280
um, including, I don't know, like if they cover Axe body spray or something like that.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280
That'd be interesting.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.200
Actually, um, Nielsen's been running, um, studies on our show here at orange lounge

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.360
radio and it's showing that, um, after tonight's episode, it looks like, uh, we had an increase

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.360
33% of our listeners decided to go to six flags after tonight's show.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.360
It's something else.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.480
All right, I'll stop.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.280
All right.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:47.680
But yeah, they said the out of, um, I guess the, the panel of, uh, 100,000 households,

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.240
uh, representing the U S population according to the, I guess their home scan panel or whatever

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.680
says scanned, uh, video game, uh, UPC barcodes.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.600
The scan barcodes were then matched to a reference library, more than 14,000 video games.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:08.160
Nielsen compared the households that purchased the least of one of the studied games before

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.060
and after the Gatorade branding was integrated into the games.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:17.000
The test group, uh, with the households that didn't purchase one, um, one of the games,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.820
the control group, it says the test and control groups are projected out abroad, blah, blah.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:29.160
See here it says, um, well overall they noticed that there was a 24% increase in sales after

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160
that.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.340
So you know what you just did?

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:36.120
You just opened the flood gates for them to like, you know, put in all sorts of ridiculous

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.300
stuff and way to go Nielsen.

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:44.320
And trust me, it's going to get ridiculous as we will get to in part B. Oh, good.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.320
Ridiculously cool though.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:51.560
I have to say, so, uh, and honestly, I think when we do talk about this, this is how you

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:56.240
do the advertisement because it's fucking awesome.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.440
Now you got me all curious.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.440
All right.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.160
We're, we're going to be talking about Sega game.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Ooh, goodie.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
All right.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.760
Uh, moving on to a story about a lawsuit, but this is the end of a lawsuit.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.760
Hooray.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:14.480
As most of them usually end up finishing, it's the end of a 2008 lawsuit that never

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.560
went to trial.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560
Yes.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.280
That's how long these things take to settle.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
Who is in the lawsuit?

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.480
It was Konami and harmonics.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.600
It was a lawsuit launched by Konami.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.640
Uh, there was a filing in a federal court in Texas this week and the two parties agreed

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.780
to dismiss all came claims and counterclaims.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:36.440
It was a suit over harmonics is rock band infringing on patents that were owned by Konami

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.960
because of course, Konami had guitar freaks many years ago, et cetera, et cetera.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.400
Rock bands, rock revolution.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.360
Well, remember they said rock revolution failed because the, the rock band two stuff.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:55.520
Well, among other things that was maybe like, like a little sliver, like half a percent

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.360
of the reasons why anyhow.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.440
Uh, there was also a 2009 countersuit via com actually filed it on behalf of harmonics

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.920
that was dropped in a federal court in Boston.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.720
So that means Konami and harmonics officially kissed and made up, but we will never know

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.600
the details of it because the terms are sealed.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600
Was there tongue?

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.600
Perhaps.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.440
We will not know because it's sealed.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.040
A slut bus was involved.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:24.320
I'm told actually, and they were all playing dance masters and with a stripper pole strip

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320
masters.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:31.760
Anyhow, now's the part of the show where we're going to let dark Sakura take over and, uh,

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.160
delve into the classic video game vault and, uh, choose a game for us that she thinks,

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160
you know what?

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.680
You little brats, you should be playing this game.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:52.400
It's classic video game of the week, dark Sakura, which they'd be playing is super Mario

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:59.680
brothers two, sweet, which, um, I actually have to think, um, Tara for suggesting super

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.320
Mario brothers, but I wanted to do super Mario brothers too.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.320
I was actually surprised.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.400
You have never picked this before, but you haven't.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.400
Yeah.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.400
You've done three, but never two.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.200
Super Mario brothers two wasn't actually a super Mario brothers game originally.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.080
It was called Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic, which was also on the Famicom disc system and had

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.720
an intro and an ending.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.680
But the intro music sounds very familiar.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.080
It's so cute.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:30.080
Oh no, the kids get sucked into a book.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080
Little monkey boys running away.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.440
I don't know what the little monkey is about.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440
He just is there.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.360
Oh no, we four people are randomly showing up in these children's bedroom.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.080
Let's jump into the book.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.600
Not creepy at all.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.600
No.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.480
Now let's flip the disc over because like I said, Famicom disc.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480
So anyway.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480
Um, what do you want to hear?

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480
Doki Doki Panic music?

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480
It's the same thing.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.480
Yeah, pretty much.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.960
Although it's funny, some of the sound effects are different and they did, uh, uh, other

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.960
sprite swaps like these weird looking head things were there, but they turned them into

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.280
mushrooms and yeah.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.720
And this one, um.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:11.120
So you pulled heads out of the grounds instead of like, you know, no different cause that'd

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.120
be really cool.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.560
You pull the vegetables out of the ground instead of these masks are sitting there instead

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.500
of the mushroom blocks.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:25.680
At any rate, um, the whole thought that Nintendo had was that the original Super Mario Brothers

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.560
2 that came out in 1986 was too hard.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:35.320
Oh no, American players, which is stupid because Japanese RPGs are ridiculously easy to start

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320
off.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.040
Did you ever play Final Fantasy 7 in Japanese?

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.040
Uh, not gonna.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.040
Freaking easy.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.040
No.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040
It's like hit dead.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040
Hit dead.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.040
So easy.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040
But it is very, very hard.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.040
The original Super Mario 2.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040
Oh yeah.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.600
The Mario, when it came out as lost levels here on the, on the Super Nintendo cartridge,

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.600
um, the All Stars or whatever, it was really hard.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.600
Yeah.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.880
Beat it eventually, but it was, it was a hard game.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:06.440
Well, um, so what they did is, um, they took, uh, Doki Doki Panic and they, uh, I guess

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.360
resprided it with the main characters and changed a few things.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.880
Like, they, because I guess there was more capacity to do stuff on the cartridge, they,

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.040
um, they actually just, uh, could put in some more graphical elements.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.240
And of course, one thing that you'll notice listening to the two, um, different tracks

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.240
is because the sound processor is just a little bit different for the games on disc versus

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240
the games.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.280
Like, if you ever listen to Legend of Zelda on disc from the disc system, the music sounds

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.280
different.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.680
I mean, it's the same music, but it's, it uses different instrumentation, but anyway.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.120
And different sound effects, um, like, uh, like the bird thing squawks differently and

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.280
it doesn't have the bonus game, like that has a different looking bonus game.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:53.280
Um, anyway, uh, so they did this because it was gonna, you know, they thought it would

01:21:53.280 --> 01:22:00.400
be more popular and that it would be, be, uh, you know, fun and easy and, and since

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:07.040
then it actually came out in Japan in 1992 as Super Mario USA, um, which came out with

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.040
Super Mario All-Stars.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.240
So, we each got something fun.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:17.400
Um, but so yeah, you walk around and you throw potions down, which in the, uh, original,

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:22.720
in the Doki Doki Panic, it's, uh, magic lamps, because it has sort of this, I guess, of Arabian

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:28.720
Nights kind of theme in all these other levels, but you get your power-ups by going into these

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:37.480
little reverse universe things and in Super Mario, um, 2, the, of course, our US one,

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:44.840
you can play as Mario, who is like the all-around average dude, or Luigi, who is, uh, I always

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:50.000
called him crazy legs dude, because his legs spin, but he jumps higher than anybody else.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.440
And you can play Toad, who, by the way, is not useless, you play Toad when you need to

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:59.400
dig a lot, because he digs faster, or when you're trying to get those extra power-ups.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.100
Who was a chick in Doki Doki Panic, right?

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.080
The blue character was a girl, wasn't it?

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.540
That was, but that wasn't Toad.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:07.540
That was Mario.

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:08.840
Oh, my bad.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:13.320
Yeah, um, and then you've got Princess, who was the pink chick with the hair and pants

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.580
in the Doki Doki Panic.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.880
But she can float, though.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.520
Yes, she can float.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:21.640
Um, but Toad can't jump for shit.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:26.640
Anyway, you get POW blocks, which blow up things, and they're really fun.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:31.640
And, um, it had a life meter, which was unique for Mario game, you know, instead of your

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.640
different sizes.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:39.520
But it was really stupid, because, like, if you lose one of your little segments there,

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:44.160
then, um, you have to kill, like, a certain number of enemies so that you can get a heart

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.200
to come up, and then you, you know, whatever, you will refill it.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.520
Um, also, to get your star.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:58.160
And I have to thank the irate gamer for this analogy, because it was spot on.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.680
You have to get, like, five cherries, and then your star will show up for your invincibility,

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.840
except it takes forever to get to where you are, unless you're at the very bottom of the

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.040
screen.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.600
And the way he described it, you have time to take a shit before the star arrives, which

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600
he proceeded to do.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.480
And I have to thank him for demonstrating that.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.480
Wow.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.480
Yes.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:25.600
Um, anyway, you, if you, uh, pull up the little, uh, plants in the little reverse universe,

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.680
then you get coins, which you can use for a bonus game, which is basically, like, slots.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.960
And there, there's a pattern to it, and I used to always be able to get the pattern

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.320
where you'd always get them to match.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.320
But it's-

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.040
It seemed like if you hit the button really fast, you could usually win it.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:47.280
It was, it was like, for me, it was like, you hit one, and then you hit the next two

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.160
twice as fast.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.600
It's, it is, it was like a duh-duh-duh was my rhythm.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.800
And I always, and I always got it, so, I guess it depends.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.560
Um, of course, if you also hit the button, like, really right away, like, after you've

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.200
gotten a cherry, then you'll always get a cherry on the next one, so.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.280
So I would have, like, 50 million lives by, by the time I was done.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.720
Um, you've also got little, uh, warp zones, where if you throw your little jar at the

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.720
right spot, it goes down.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.200
Ooh, you got audio issues going on.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.880
Um, were the warp zones in Doki Doki Panic?

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.360
Yes, they were.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.360
Interesting.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.240
In fact, if you watch the playthrough, um, cause I linked a playthrough for Doki Doki

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240
Panic.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.440
Which is all you need to see of Doki Doki Panic, really.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.680
It really wasn't the better game.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.560
Like, a lot of people are like, oh, you know, it was the original, duh-duh-duh, but they

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.760
made improvements when they brought it over here.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.000
Yeah, well, keep in mind, they had more, if I'm right, they had more storage capacity.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.720
The only thing that we're missing is the dinky little intro, which you had to flip the disk

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.040
anyway to start off with, and then flip to play the game, and then flip to go back, and

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.960
flip and flip and flip, and whatever, got tired of flipping off.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.840
So, but yeah, all the, all the warps and everything were there, you just throw them where there's

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.520
a particular jar, you go down the jar, boom, you're somewhere else.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.960
And I love this little trick for, what is it, 6-1?

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.440
Yeah, if you hear the sound, like, going crazy in the background, it's cause they're doing

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.720
this trick where they go under the quicksand, and then jump, jump through the wall type

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.720
of thing.

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.720
Yeah.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.160
It, that was, that was always one of my favorite tricks.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:20.360
And there's also one in the very last level, where if you climb up to one screen in the,

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.200
in the final castle, and then you let yourself fall and then jump, you will actually can

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.600
skip, like, a whole bunch of screens.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.960
Although for me, I was, like, playing everything through.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:40.480
So, yeah, uh, it was, uh, they actually were planning on, um, releasing, uh, Doki Doki

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.080
Panic in the US at some point, but they actually just didn't.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:52.720
And so they, they, you know, one thing about this, though, is that the reason why it does

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:57.840
kind of fit in musically, and with sound effects, is cause the, um, the soundtrack was composed

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.840
by Koji Kondo.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.840
Oh, okay.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:05.840
So it's very interesting to me, like, how much this ended up kind of just becoming a

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.320
part of the Mario mythos, if you will.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.280
Like, you know, later Mario games had some of these characters that first appeared in

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.960
really Doki Doki Panic kind of crossed over into the Mario universe, especially like some

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.220
of the, I want to say, like, uh, the second Yoshi game on Super Nintendo, like, a lot

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.880
of those monsters kind of were from this game.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.480
Yeah, because it was so popular that they really just ended up incorporating it into

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.880
the whole Mario branding, I guess.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.520
As much as you might want to think Nintendo was kind of rude for dumbing it down, it really

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.520
worked for them.

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.520
It did.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.520
On multiple levels, in this case.

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.200
It was interesting to me, though, just real quick, sorry, I know you have more you want

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.840
to say, but, um, it was really interesting to me how this game really fit into the very

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.480
odd 8-bit sequels that were nothing like the originals, in many ways.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.280
You know, you had this, you had Castlevania II Simon's Quest, which was a huge departure

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:00.120
from the original, Zelda II was a huge departure from the original, it was very interesting

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:04.400
how a lot of games, you know, were so different back then.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.720
It was just how it was done, you know, I think it was more of a desire to innovate and keep

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.280
people interested, but one thing that, you know, and I think that's what they finally

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.720
end up realizing is that people usually like the original games for a reason, and kind

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.160
of want to keep them around, although, I remember playing this game, I rented it when I was

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.480
a kid, and was just like, see, that's where you can go over all the screens, and I was

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.400
just sort of like, what the crap, Nintendo, what'd you do this to me for, what's this

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:35.040
ostrich thing spitting eggs at me, and then I liked it.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:42.280
Um, so, at any rate, um, we, uh, later on, there were the re-releases, there were Super

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:50.800
Mario All-Stars, which was really sweet, and then, um, there was, you remember the Satellaview,

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:57.120
Mario was a, uh, Gaiden version that was, um, Super Mario All-Stars on Satellaview,

01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:03.120
and it, it was called BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge, and so it ran in weekly volumes

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.120
like all the other Satellaview games.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:14.840
Um, then we got Super Mario Advance, which was, um, the Super Mario Brothers 2, which

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:20.680
actually was a lot harder, but it had some innovations that kept the game fresh, I think,

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:21.680
for a lot of people.

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.480
I, I really liked it.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:30.560
And so it's, uh, Super Mario 2, or as the original was, because I, I think I'd have

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:37.960
to lump the games together, is that it was, uh, Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:44.480
And actually, since I'm talking about that too, um, they did a Mario-style poster based

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.260
off of the original cover for Doki Doki Panic.

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.480
And the characters that were in there, um, was-

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.840
I just want to point out in the time you've been talking, someone beat Mario 2 here on

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.840
YouTube.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.840
Yeah.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.840
That's pretty amazing.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.840
I gotta say, that's pretty amazing.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:29:59.840
And by the way, I was-

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840
You cut out again.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:01.840
You cut out again.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:02.840
You scared to us.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.840
That mic is, is getting dated.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.760
I, no, the mic is new, I need a new cord.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.760
Yeah.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.960
At any rate, um, Imogene was, um, the, one of the little Toad-looking characters.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:18.160
And then there was Mama, who was the one in the blue, that was Luigi.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:24.240
And then there was Lina, who was the pink princess harem girl.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:30.120
And uh, Papa, who, who became Toad.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:37.160
And he actually, um, I think became a, no, the, no, I'm wrong.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.160
Forget I said anything.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.160
Anyway.

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.160
Okay.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:44.040
Um, oh, now here's the differences, um, different title screen.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:49.240
And then, um, the story takes place in the storybook instead of in the dream world.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:55.240
And um, you have a save feature, because it was on the disk system.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.840
You cannot run with the B button.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.620
There, like I said, different music changes, different graphical changes.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:07.160
And you need fewer hits to hit wart in Doki Doki Panic than in Super Mario 2.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.720
The waterfall is faster than in Super Mario 2.

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:14.720
And of course different sound effects because of the, uh, the number of pins between the

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.320
Famicom disk and the full-size NES cartridges.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.060
And there you go.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.220
So it's sort of a split one.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:28.400
We have, it's Yumikojo, Doki Doki Panic, and, um, Super Mario Bros. 2.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.600
All right.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.800
There it is, your classic game of the week, Mario 2, here in the US, or Doki Doki Panic

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.000
overseas.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.100
Good pick.

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.800
One that I'm sure a lot of people remember.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.800
All right.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.440
We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.440
We're going to be right back.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.360
There's plenty more to come tonight in part B of our show.

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.920
We're actually going to get into some more of the news that's coming out of Tokyo Game

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920
Show.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.920
We didn't do a lot this segment.

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920
We've got plenty more to come.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.160
Of course, your calls and tweets and emails, of which I'm sure there's plenty.

01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.560
We're going to get to all those.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.320
And more Rice Princess and the Doctor.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.320
Yay.

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.320
Maybe.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.320
If I don't kick them off the show.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.320
Yes, it's going to happen.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320
All right.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:07.080
No, they'll be here to tell more poop jokes when we return.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:15.160
With more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.720
And welcome back, everybody, to the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, live here at

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:24.080
All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.160
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:30.920
Going back over to Dark Sakura for a minute here, because she was talking about something

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.300
during break that I thought was fascinating.

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:36.320
You mentioned you were telling Rice Princess about some documentary you've been watching

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.320
lately.

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.320
What is this?

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.320
It's not a documentary.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.920
I'm watching a Japanese drama from 2006 called Gal Circle.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:48.880
That's about these, like, these girls that, you know, are homeless and live in Shinjuku.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.920
They quit school to go be Para Para dancers.

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.840
And they hang out in this warehouse and, you know, leech free food wherever they can find

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.840
it.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:02.280
And it's a, it's a cute show, but like one of the characters is, um.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.280
What the hell?

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.520
I'm listening to something, coming from the living room, that's like, Dan's watching the

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.760
Angry Nintendo Nerd.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.200
Oh God.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:17.080
Anyway, um, so, but like the whole thing starts off with these, uh, US troops dropping somebody

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.240
on, on, uh, Shinjuku.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:22.120
And it's this guy dressed up as a cowboy named Shinosuke.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:25.220
Cause you know, all Americans are cowboys.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.320
From Arizona.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:32.720
And he lives the Indian lifestyle and he's good friends with Geronimo, who is this Japanese

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.720
guy in Arizona dressed up like an Indian.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.360
And he actually looks the part.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.760
Sounds amazingly racist, I love it.

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.760
And this little girl named Momo, who, they're all like speaking random English.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:45.760
It's hilarious.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.760
So it's not a documentary.

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.800
It's just, it's just a dramedy.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.800
It's a dorama.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.680
Oh, okay.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.640
And but it's like this guy completely knows nothing of Japanese life and he's teaching

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.180
the girls these lessons through his innocence and.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.560
And they teach him the magic of dance.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.760
I'm on, I'm on the fourth episode now out of 11 and it's, uh, it's pretty funny.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.040
I don't know how I miss this.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.040
Yeah, I think I'll watch more Hoarders.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:18.040
All right, Rob, teach me the magic of dance.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.040
Excuse me.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.040
Sorry.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.040
Not time for Twitter topics yet.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.040
Be quiet.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040
All right.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040
Hey.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.040
I was listening.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.520
I was at the club the other night and I actually heard a song and the lyrics were, and the

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:33.840
song is called commander and the lyrics were tonight I'll be your commander and I command

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.400
you to dance.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.400
That's where that came from.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.400
Yeah.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.400
That was my favorite.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.400
A little bit homosexual.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.400
Just a little.

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:49.040
Was it, was it commander or commander command like a Commodore 64 commander better?

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.480
It was no.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.600
When I tell you who it was singing it, that's how you'll know how homosexual it was.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600
You ready?

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.600
Yes.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.600
Kelly Rowland.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.600
Wow.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.680
Like the not Beyonce, but yeah, Beyonce, the other chick from Destiny's Child.

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:04.680
Yes.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.680
Exactly.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.680
I can't believe it's not Beyonce.

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.680
Hey, video game news.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.680
Oh my God.

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.680
Who knew we did that on this show?

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.720
Uh, a lot of quick video game news tonight.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.720
Holy hell.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.120
There's a lot of quick news tonight.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:19.080
And um, I believe Loki has a story starting off about fantasy star, but I want to say

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:24.640
this first because this somehow did not even make our show roll, which is a travesty.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.240
Fantasy star online two teased in a trailer this week at Tokyo game show.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.240
What in the world?

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.240
I know, right?

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.200
The, because it's the 10th anniversary of fantasy star online and they have announced

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.960
that next year they're going to put out fantasy star online two for PC.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.080
I'll play it.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.240
But it's not on console.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.800
That's weird to me that it's not on console.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.120
I'm wondering what they're going to do with it.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.480
They're still getting to MMOs on consoles.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:51.640
I mean, at least like the PlayStation three and Xbox 360 because so far this generation

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.960
there's been Final Fantasy 11.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.960
Wasn't there another one on 360?

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.960
Oh, fantasy star universe.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:58.960
Haha.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:35:59.960
Yeah, sort of.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.880
But that had a more of a single player component to it though.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.360
It wasn't just an MMO.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.320
This shut down.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320
The game would still be playable.

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.800
It's like a really bad anime.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800
All right, sorry.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.240
I didn't mean to derail your story, Loki, but I had to throw that out there.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:18.360
Before the break, we were talking about advertisement and games and you know how it's kind of terrible

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.360
sometimes.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.360
Well, this is how you do it.

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:26.280
Damn it, because I couldn't think of a better way to possibly advertise in the game than

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.080
how it's done in fantasy star portable two.

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:34.760
What, may you ask, is actually the case with this?

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.720
You can play Colonel Sanders in fantasy star portable two.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.720
That is awesome.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.720
Wait, wait, wait.

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:42.720
Like a playable character?

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:44.280
Like a playable character.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:47.840
Like the Colonel is there to kick ass.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:54.840
Back from the dead with his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices.

01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:00.920
I read some story that like most kids under 18 don't even know who Colonel Sanders is.

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:06.920
Like, oh, but he's going to come and bitch slap him in the face now.

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.480
Now you'll remember me forever.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:13.540
No, but seriously, it's, um, they put him in the game and this isn't a big surprise

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:17.880
because actually, I believe it's in the upgraded version of fantasy star portable two.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.760
It's infinity, I guess.

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.560
And the original fantasy star portable two actually had pizza hut stuff in there with

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.640
like a pizza hut box shield.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:33.400
Oh hell, you know what that means coming in the next fantasy star game is Taco Bell.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.260
Make a run for the PSP.

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.200
Or the noid comes back as a playable character.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.800
Dude, the noid would be awesome.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.320
I'm sorry, but if anyone's seen the anime project Aco, you don't mess with the Colonel.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320
It's the Colonel.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.520
Oh, that's so ridiculous.

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.680
Lee awesome.

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.680
It is awesome.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.760
So instead of casting like the typical like ice fire bolt spells, you'll be casting like,

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:06.520
you know, Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, heart attack, grease fire, KFC bowl, double

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:13.880
down the, the bowl that looks like poop, wait, wait, wait.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.880
That's nasty.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.000
And they have pictures of him attacking stuff.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.740
So I'm trying to see what he, look, it almost looks like, and I kid you not, and I don't

01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:27.200
understand this, but it almost looks like he has a magic wand.

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:32.040
Like he's fucking Harry Potter of the, you know, fast food world or something.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:37.040
Um, he's like hitting some, yeah, seriously looking like he's bitch slapping someone right

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.040
there.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.760
Uh, this is all on Famitsu of course.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.720
I got it one more here cause it looks like he's throwing a fireball or something.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.600
Uh, God, I love the Japanese.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.800
Yeah, he's got like, seriously, he's got like a magical wand.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:57.360
I mean Colonel Sanders, dude, you put your name in the Goblet of Fire, going to our chat

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:04.320
room and chat that orange lounge radio.com, um, SSG100 Matt says, gravy heel, please.

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.920
Uh, Vid, Vid Power says, when are they going to make a fighter featuring the Arby's oven

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:10.920
mitt?

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.360
Uh, DDR dollar bill says you're Juan Sanders.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.840
Is it made from chicken feather?

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.960
I seriously think a great, cause you know how Burger King does their stupid, like, you

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.120
know, Burger King games, which I will, by the way, fucking rad, which is by the way,

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.840
when they do release their Kinect games, I'm buying all of them.

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.200
I don't care how terrible they are, because they're awesome.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:37.240
Seriously, KFC needs to come up with like an original game where it's like, oh, kids

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.680
don't know who Colonel Sanders is, he's back to kick some fucking ass with his magical

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.680
wand.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.000
He's a fucking ninja, that's what he is.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.840
Ooh, I'm back from the dead, ooh.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.600
He's gonna battle Voldemort as well.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.840
Is it bad that your little thing is blinking red?

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.080
Does that mean it's gonna explode?

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.960
Nah, it just means the battery's low.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:54.960
Okay.

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.160
This means I won't have internet after a while.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.160
I'm so worried.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.160
Alright.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.160
It means the time bomb's going off.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160
Oh no.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160
I'm in my house.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.080
This show will self-destruct in 30 seconds.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.560
You brought Burger King into my house.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.560
Hasn't it already?

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.640
Yeah, it's alright, anyways, I should finish my downloads when I get home, cause this is

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.640
so slow.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:12.640
What are you downloading?

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.640
Apps.

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.640
Wow.

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.440
I'm downloading the two Monkey Island apps.

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.440
Oh.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:18.440
Sweet.

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.840
But I thought those, that's not like a 4G router?

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.200
No, it's just 3G.

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.200
Oh.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.640
I don't know anything about it, sorry.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640
Next story.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640
But yeah.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.680
I'm sorry, it's just so awesome that we have to keep talking about the kernel.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:37.620
So Halo Reach, of course, you know, one of the big things with Halo, and it's kinda become

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:39.600
infamous because of it.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.160
The horrible people on Xbox Live, and it's a lot of little kids that really shouldn't

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:45.160
be playing-

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.960
I love when you start off the horrible people on Xbox Live.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.740
It really, there's just a bunch of little kids that have no, should have no business

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.040
playing this game.

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.080
They're on there playing this game.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:03.480
So if you run across some douchebags that are playing the game and being jerks online

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:09.360
and you mute them, if enough people mute them, they will just be auto-muted by everybody.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:14.160
So you won't have to listen to them over a period of time, so.

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.360
But they just like to call people fun, amazing guys.

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.840
Yep.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.480
Uh, yes.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.800
Wow.

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.000
I praise your heterosexuality.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.800
We are friends.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.940
So that's available, of course, now.

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:40.960
And then, apparently, who would have thought, the PSP2 is in the works, and in fact, the

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.760
Mortal Kombat developers have a development unit of it right now.

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:51.960
They say it's a pretty powerful machine, and that they will be working on games for it,

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.760
and they said it's, they don't even have a 3DS yet, but apparently they have a PSP2.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:04.000
Perhaps the PSP2 will be launching next year, soon, hmm, maybe?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.400
So I guess we'll have to wait and see what they do to enhance stuff on that.

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.960
Wow, newsflash, a PSP2 is in development, shock and awe.

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.200
Yeah, but the news is that they- File that next to Duh, and of course.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.240
But the news is that they have a unit, and that it would probably be close to be releasing.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.840
Next year's E3.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.280
I'm sure it will be next holiday.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280
For next holiday.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.040
Alongside Shattered Memories 2, the next winner of the E3 game.

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.520
Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio, three games analysts.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.520
Ah, yes.

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.160
Analists, sorry, analists.

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:42.880
And Red Faction Armageddon is coming May 2011 next year, and of course that'll be the next

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.840
big game from the Saints Row developers.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:52.760
And speaking of Saints Row, they will be putting out a new Saints Row game next fall.

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.760
So sad.

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.760
So far away.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760
I love that game.

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.360
I know you do.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.800
It's so terribly awesome.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.520
It really is.

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.840
Well something maybe you could play in the meantime would be PopCap World, because PopCap

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:11.200
and NCSoft have teamed up to bring you PopCap World, oh boy, because you have NCSoft who

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:14.800
makes those highly addictive Korean MMOs, and then some of the ones over here too such

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.440
as Ion and Guild Wars.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:24.440
And then PopCap, makers of virtual crack, like Pagle, Plants and Zombies, and Bejeweled.

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.460
PopCap and NCSoft have come together to bring PopCap World.

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.320
This platform will be launching later this year.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.840
It's going to be operated by NCSoft, it's going to feature 13 PopCap titles at launch.

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.320
It's going to be free, with optional premium paid elements to be added later.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.640
It's going to have Bejeweled, and Plants vs. Zombies, and an all new multiplayer game called

01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:45.600
Super Zuma.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:50.720
Here's the other thing you should know about this, it's only for Korea, so it's not coming

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.720
out here.

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.800
Why the fuck did you tell us, Rob?

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.920
Because I just want you to know what you're missing out on.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.680
Super Zuma, by the way, was quote, built exclusively for Korean players.

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:06.160
So Super Zuma apparently uses Starcraft characters.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.640
And the screen is very narrow for their eyes.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.640
Stop it.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.180
Hey, I can say it, I'm Asian.

01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:13.180
You can say it.

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.180
Yes I can.

01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.180
Alright.

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:17.760
So yeah, that's going to be interesting.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.800
I'm surprised they won't release that here, but maybe Facebook games are doing well enough

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.800
for them here.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.160
Did they ever release the Zuma game on Facebook?

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.160
I don't know.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.160
I think they did zoom on Facebook.

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.160
I think they were going to.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.920
They were going to do zoom on Facebook, and then of course there's Bejeweled.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.960
And now it's all about just cross-promoting their iPhone apps, that's how they're making

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960
money.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.800
Loki, do you have Plants vs. Zombies on your new iPod Touch?

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.280
Yes I do, it's very fun.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.280
Awesome!

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.560
Oh yeah, I played a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies this week.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.560
For the first time.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.920
Can you believe I've never played that game before, and I finally played it this week

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.920
on Xbox Live?

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.360
Crazy, I've never played it.

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:49.360
It's crack rock.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.280
I mean, I've played a zillion and one tower defense games before, it's just, you know,

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.280
this is another one.

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:54.400
But it's cute.

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:55.400
It's pop-crack.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.400
Mm-hmm.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.400
Mm-hmm.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400
Hey!

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.040
Speaking of other crack games, some people really love these games.

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.680
Muramasa, the Demon Blade, and Odin Sphere.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:08.600
Yeah, these games are being remade in HD if rumors are to be believed.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.280
This is only rumor right now.

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.480
The re-releases are highly likely for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.480
Here's the giveaway.

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.480
They're being listed by the Australia ratings board as multi-platform.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.480
Hmm.

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.160
Odin Sphere, of course, was originally on the PS2, Muramasa on the Wii.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.460
That would be kind of awesome if those games were re-released.

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:32.880
The Last Guardian finally has a release date.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.880
Holiday 2011.

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.600
You might remember, this was the game they showed, I think, in a trailer.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.760
Didn't they show this for the first time, like, last year's E3?

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.760
I don't know.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.640
But they finally showed it at Tokyo Game Show.

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640
Another trailer.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:45.640
Oh.

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640
This is the Aiko show.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.640
Yes.

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.640
The Colossus continuation.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.640
Yes.

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.640
Holiday 2011.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.640
It looks epic.

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640
I mean, I gotta say.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640
I'd play it.

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.640
Yeah.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640
It has a big, cute sort of puppy thing.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640
Mm-hmm.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.640
I'd play it.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640
Well, there's a whole little trailer here that was from Tokyo Game Show.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640
I'll play a little clip here.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.640
I don't want to play the whole thing.

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:01.640
But you can see...

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.640
Excuse me.

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.640
Sorry.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640
I watched this the other day.

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640
Look at that.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.640
There's that giant puppy thing.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.640
I don't know what the hell it is, but I'd play it.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.640
It looks like it's gonna crap on that guy.

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.640
Probably because it is.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.640
Silent Hill is the poopy game.

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:14.640
It's a dog, so...

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.640
All right.

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.600
Speaking of Aiko and Shadow of the Colossus, the collection that's been rumored for the

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.120
past couple weeks, it's true.

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.720
It's HD remakes coming exclusively to the PlayStation 3.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.360
They're also in 3D.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.360
Wow.

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360
But whatever.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.880
At least they're 2D as well.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:32.880
Yeah.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.080
They're coming to the PlayStation 3.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.580
They won't name a release date.

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:43.720
They're just saying soon, but of course the retailers were rumoring April 2011.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.680
Sony Computer Entertainment America actually confirmed later spring 2011.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.240
So it's coming.

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.800
There's box art and everything, and there's a trailer for that as well.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:56.640
The game looks sexy as hell, and I'm gonna admit, I didn't really play these games the

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.640
first time around.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.200
I watched Loki play one of them.

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.520
I watched a certain unnamed person play them.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.520
Really?

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:03.520
Yeah.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:04.520
Are they hot?

01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:09.400
Yeah, all that Aiko is is this girl making a stupid noise following you, and then Shadow

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:12.280
of the Colossus is like you're climbing a guy and killing him.

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280
I don't know.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.280
I mean, I'm sure it would be fun if you played it.

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:17.280
You make these sound so stupid, but they're like some of the highest critically acclaimed

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.280
games.

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.280
You know, when you watch it, it's like, I don't know.

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.080
It was boring to me, but I think if I played it, I'd probably like it better.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.360
Comment from our chat room from Spazinator PSN.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.120
Does that puppy thing remind you of the Luck Dragon from The Never Ending Story?

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:30.120
Falkor?

01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.120
Fuck yeah.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.120
Kinda.

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.120
Didn't he always sound like he was high?

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.120
Falkor?

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.720
He's like, oh yeah, scratch my ear.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.960
Also, get me some munchies, could ya?

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.960
I've been laying here for like six hours really high.

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.960
Sorry.

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:48.960
Derailing.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.960
No, that's okay.

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.000
It happens on the show as well.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.600
So where is Frank West in Dead Rising 2?

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.320
He isn't showing up in the game and, you know, Frank West, of course, was the main character

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.760
in Dead Rising 1.

01:47:58.760 --> 01:47:59.760
Well, he's been found.

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:00.760
He's covered wars, you know.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:01.760
What?

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.440
I said he's covered wars, you know.

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.440
That's right.

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.200
He's coming to a new game called Dead Rising Case West.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.200
That's right.

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.200
It's an epilogue to Dead Rising 2.

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.200
Aha!

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.280
So Dead Rising Case 0 was the prologue.

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:19.120
Case West will now be the epilogue.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.120
Get it?

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.120
Cool.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.200
That's why you've seen photos of the two characters standing next to each other.

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.120
Case West is gonna be a download title.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.960
It's gonna be exclusive on the Xbox 360.

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.400
It will have co-op play where one of you is Chuck and one of you is Frank.

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:34.400
Cool.

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.880
Sorry to my gay friends, but no word about hot man-on-man action with the Chuck and Frank.

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.160
Boo!

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160
Next topic.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160
Okay.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.280
No gayness in this one.

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.640
On that topic, does Dark Star, you've heard of the Doctor Who game, right?

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.640
Yes.

01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:53.240
And, you know, considering how the Russell T. Davies is like the head of Doctor Who,

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.680
do you think there'll be any man-on-man action in the game?

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.840
We need Captain Jack in it.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.640
We need Captain Jack and the 50 million gay kisses he has on Torchwood.

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:02.640
Yes.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.640
Yeah.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.640
Oh, you've heard about the new season of Torchwood.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640
Hold on.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640
The gay alarm is going off.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.640
The show got too gay.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.640
What?

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.640
What?

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:11.640
Good job.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.640
Sorry, John Barrowman.

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.640
We're in Rob Network.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.640
We're going down the homosexual limit.

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.640
That's right.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:19.920
We just got an order from the police department of Sacramento to turn down the gayness a little

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.920
bit, please.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.920
All right.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.920
Man up, guys.

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:23.920
Too late.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:24.920
Too late.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:25.920
Well, how about some other news, Rob?

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:26.920
Yes.

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:32.600
How about Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has characters that make me absolutely absolutely mad.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:33.600
Absolutely.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.600
Really, really happy.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:35.600
Horny.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.600
Wow.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:37.600
I thought this was what she was going to say.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.920
Wasn't going to go there, but all right.

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.640
I said happy.

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.040
X-23 is in the game.

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.920
That makes me happy.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:52.200
As in the chick clone of Wolverine, who's actually kind of awesome.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.200
And hot?

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.400
Dark Sakura hot?

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.480
I guess if you like.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.200
So then you would be a little horny.

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.200
I'm just kidding.

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:03.000
I would bite my butt, Rob.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.660
And of course, you know, we also have Tron Bon in there.

01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:13.640
And also other characters announced for Street Fighter IV.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.020
This is pretty cool, is Yun and Yang.

01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:18.280
So pretty cool.

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:19.280
From Street Fighter III.

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.040
I think that's pretty cool.

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.480
They were fun to play.

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.480
And Chun-Li.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.680
I do not like Chun-Li.

01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.960
She's in every fucking Street Fighter game except the very first one.

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.400
Fighting Street.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:42.280
And then IGN found a game breaking bug in a certain game that we like to complain about

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280
sometimes.

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.240
Even though I don't think any of us in here have played it.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.440
Metroid Other M. I just know it's crap.

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.440
3D Metroid.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.400
I'm not passing judgment until I play it.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.200
And Rice Princess doesn't like any of the 3D Metroid games.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.200
So she's biased.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.920
I also don't like horseless carriages and metal birds.

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.440
Who are you?

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:11.280
At any rate, the bug, if you are in Sector 3 and a certain door stays locked, you'll

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.720
be locked there forever.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:13.720
You're just stuck.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:18.420
You're kind of like there being no boss at level 30.

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:23.820
And Nintendo did confirm it and they said that right now the only solutions are to load

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:27.640
an earlier save or start over from the beginning.

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:29.120
What a solution.

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:32.120
They haven't said anything about fixing it.

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.480
They're like, duh stupid, just restart the game.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.480
That also happened in the...

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:39.280
And the best part is they can't fix it because the Wii doesn't patch games.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.600
No, but that also happened in...

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.600
There's a potential that they can patch it through a firmware update.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:46.600
Oh, interesting.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:47.600
They can't.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.600
Poop.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.600
Oh yeah.

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.600
Poop.

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:51.600
Well, and good news.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.600
Good happy news.

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:53.600
Where's my...

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:54.600
What are you gonna do?

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.600
Rob.

01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:56.600
What?

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:57.600
Hi.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:58.600
Fanfare.

01:51:58.600 --> 01:51:59.600
I don't have a fanfare.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.600
Hold on.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:01.600
Well then sing it.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:02.600
Poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:03.600
Thank you, Irene.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:04.600
Okay.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.600
You're welcome.

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.600
Why don't I?

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.600
I'm getting your fanfare music.

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:08.600
But we already did it, Rob.

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:09.600
We're done.

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.600
You don't need to do it anymore.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:11.600
It has the stamp of Irene on it.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600
Yes.

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.600
Hold on.

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600
Okay, here's your fanfare.

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:20.600
I knew it.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.880
One of the best shooting games ever.

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:24.880
And it's Tres-Ar goodness.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.680
And I have to say it's Tres-Ar, because it's treasure.

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:37.860
Iridion Silver Gun, yay, is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, yay.

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:42.080
And it'll be out in 2011, exclusively on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:46.600
It will have updated graphics, online co-op, and an Ikaruga mode.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:47.600
Ikaruga?

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:48.600
Oh my.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:53.540
And then that means that I don't have to spend $400 to play it at home.

01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:55.920
Just some Microsoft points.

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.340
That's always good.

01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:03.800
The last time I played Ikaruga was on an arcade machine in Las Vegas.

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.800
Wow.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.400
So that was a long time ago.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.720
The last time I played Ikaruga was one of the boss fights in Tournament of the Champions.

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.720
Not Ikaruga.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.720
Radiant Silver Gun.

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:15.000
Last time I played Radiant Silver Gun.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.160
Oh, okay.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.360
And I touched a Saturn copy at California Extreme.

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.360
It was pretty.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.360
It was expensive.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.480
They wanted like $600 for it.

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.360
No, that's California Extreme!

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.360
Extreme!

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.360
Thank you, Eddie.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.360
Extremely nerdy.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360
It was awesome.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:35.080
So Radiant Silver Gun, Dan, we're getting this!

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.080
He's so excited.

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.680
How about Twitter topics?

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:38.680
No.

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680
Okay.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:45.000
Uh, every week we read your tweets at Twitter.com slash OLR, and I forgot to ask for them tonight,

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.680
so we have very few from tweeters who remember that we do this every week.

01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:49.680
Rob, fail.

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:50.680
That's all right, we'll do it with you.

01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:53.640
Well, if you want, if you wanted to get in a tweet and you forgot, you could hurry up

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.520
and send an email, because I don't think Dark Saga's opened the mailbag yet, so you can

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.520
hurry.

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.520
Yes.

01:53:58.520 --> 01:53:59.520
Dope.

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:00.520
All right, uh, let's see.

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.960
Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:04.440
Pot Culture sent a tweet.

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:07.560
It actually isn't really directly related to the show, but I thought it was interesting.

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.680
He says, sorry gang, not gonna make the live feed tonight, playing a bit of Phantasy Star

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.540
Portable 2 then calling it a night.

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:15.960
By the way, code required for online multiplayer in PSP 2.

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:20.200
Now it looks like Sega's jumped on board with that whole thing.

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:21.200
Yay.

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:26.560
Blue Swim sends us a tweet with a story about Microsoft believes that Kinect will blow away

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.000
iPad sales.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
What?

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.680
Good luck with that.

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:33.760
Totally unrelated product comparison.

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:35.800
I know, right?

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:36.800
Seriously?

01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:38.800
I don't see how that's gonna work.

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.040
Christmas gifts, maybe?

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.040
I don't know.

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:48.160
Well, I could see that because, you know, the Kinect is only 150 bucks.

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:56.520
The comments coming from Kudosunoda of Microsoft saying this, quote, the preorders have been

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.680
really strong.

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.000
As far as what we're looking at for holiday, this is going to be stuff that'll blow away

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.160
any of the sales you've seen with the iPad.

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.360
This is in a remarks to Gamasutra.

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.280
The Xbox 360 is already selling better than the Wii and Sony right now.

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.800
Kinect's really just going to boost that to a whole new level.

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:16.120
And my television will outsell my car.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:18.240
I think that they're comparing numbers.

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:21.260
I think all they're doing is comparing numbers.

01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:26.120
And then Aaron Greenberg joins in saying, quote, we believe this will be the biggest

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.360
launch in our history for Xbox.

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:35.040
We will sell more Kinect sensors than we did systems at Xbox 360 launch and like such as

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.920
in the maps and the Iraq.

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.400
Here's kind of a side related question.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:42.520
Do you guys think that Xbox actually is not planning on another system in the next couple

01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:43.520
of years?

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.440
Let me get to that a minute, but first, A, they're going to sell more Kinects than Xbox

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:52.760
360s at launch because there weren't any fucking Xbox 360s available at launch.

01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.760
Remember?

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.760
Never forget.

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:58.200
There was like no 360s anywhere for like six months.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.160
They were in very limited supplies.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.280
I see what you're doing there, you little...

01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.280
Liar.

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.280
Yep.

01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:05.280
All right.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:06.840
Now, what was the other question?

01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.840
I'm sorry.

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:11.200
Well, they've kind of alluded to this is they're not coming out with a new system for a while.

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.280
I'm wondering if that's just a bunch of crap.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.440
Actually, I believe it.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.160
I think the gap is going to be a little longer than you've seen in years past.

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:23.160
I think though the seal is going to get broken probably in the next couple of years.

01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:26.280
I think Nintendo will be the first to do it, but next year they're going to be riding the

01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.360
wave of the 3DS, but I think maybe the year after that they're going to name the Wii successor

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.740
and I think that'll kind of be the first in a wave.

01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:36.680
Probably Microsoft at about two years will announce their successor too.

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:41.160
I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of updates to current consoles going on is

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.960
because A, it's all about the digital distribution and upgrades.

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:51.360
B, it's because of the economy and people don't have $400, $500, $600 to jump on a brand

01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.880
new system.

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.600
I know what they're going to release next.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.600
Uh-oh.

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:56.600
What?

01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:01.080
They're going to release the Xbox 360 that doesn't get the red ring of death.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.280
That'll be their new console.

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:08.760
Technically, they did release that new Xbox 360, don't call it a slim, but the slimmer

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.760
360.

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.760
Uh-huh.

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:11.760
That's out now.

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.760
More breakable.

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:13.760
No, it can't red ring because it doesn't have rings.

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:14.760
Oh.

01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:15.760
Clever.

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:16.760
Well played, Microsoft.

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.760
I'm onto you, though.

01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:26.960
No, it also has its senses and if the internal parts are getting too hot, which causes that,

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:29.640
it actually shuts the system down before it will red ring.

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640
Wait, wait.

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640
Oh, wonderful.

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.520
That's the worst solution ever.

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.320
Oh, man.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.320
Or as Frisbee in chat calls it, the Xbox 360.

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:42.360
Oh, guffaw, guffaw, guffaw.

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.800
Oh, good one.

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:46.960
Here's the thing, though.

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:50.520
Don't be too excited for the next consoles because I'm going to tell you, especially

01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:55.560
probably from Sony's camp, the next series of consoles, one of them's going to get ballsy

01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:57.560
and it'll probably be Sony.

01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.120
Totally digital distribution.

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.120
Just wait.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.120
Okay.

01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.120
It's a digital distribution.

01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.640
Then the games better be cheaper.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:07.640
They won't.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:08.640
I don't care.

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.360
Hey, we've got more tweets from Tiger Claw.

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:11.360
A what?

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:16.360
Hi, Tiger Claw.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:21.160
I'm looking at Matt over here and he's got the mic rested on his chin and he's working

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:24.680
on his iPad touch, so it's multitasking over here.

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:25.680
Anyhow.

01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:30.160
I'm playing Plants vs. Zombies.

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:36.160
Tiger Claw and Link, speaking of Apple and apps and stuff, they rejected the Onions shoot

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.800
people point blank in the face game.

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:39.800
What?

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:40.800
Why?

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.800
That's really too bad.

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:44.400
There's actually a little trailer here that you can watch.

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:45.400
Okay.

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:46.400
My fantasy.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.400
Oh, this is a whole little, hold on, they're showing it at first.

01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.120
We're about to have a photo of Loki playing.

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:55.880
But apparently the Onion wrote about a fictional first person shooter.

01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:00.120
It's called Close Range and you just repeatedly shoot people and animals point blank in the

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:01.120
face.

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.720
Wait, that's a game?

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:08.880
You mean that's not every first person shooter?

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.000
Video game fans are lining up today to be the first to purchase Close Range.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.180
The hotly anticipated video game in which players repeatedly shoot people point blank

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.180
in the face.

01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:22.400
Onion News Network tech trends reporter Jeff Tate has more.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.400
Thanks Bobby.

01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:27.900
Close Range is already being hailed by critics as the most important game of the year.

01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:32.320
The first person shooter creates an immersive richly detailed world where players shoot

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:33.960
people in the face with guns.

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.840
Reviewers say it brings a new level of depth to gaming.

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:40.600
Just like great literature film transports you to different worlds, Close Range transports

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.640
you to a world where you fire bullets into an endless stream of faces.

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:49.320
Fans say it's the game's well developed characters and storyline that make Close Range so compelling.

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:52.920
You just feel like you're inside this complex character who's thrust into a world where

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.320
he has to blow people's heads off.

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:59.440
The plot follows AJ, a man with a mysterious past who must explode hundreds of thousands

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:03.060
of human faces on a quest to save his kidnapped brother.

02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:04.680
Who are you?

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.760
Someone who can help.

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:08.600
I know where your brother is.

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:09.600
Tell me.

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:10.600
Look out!

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:14.100
But Close Range's single player story is just the beginning.

02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:19.340
Its outstanding multiplayer mode offers unparalleled interactivity by allowing players to blast

02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:20.760
each other's faces off.

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:21.960
It's completely open-ended.

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:25.240
You can shoot someone in the ear, but you can also shoot them in the eye.

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.880
With hundreds of hidden extras like side missions where players can take a break from shooting

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.440
people in the face to shoot animals in the face, Close Range will keep players from floating

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.440
in the face.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:39.520
And with the sequel, Close Range 2 Chainsaw Dawn continuing the epic story next fall,

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.800
Close Range fans have even more to look forward to.

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.960
For the Onion News Network, I'm Geoff Tate.

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:45.960
Thanks Geoff.

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:46.960
Wow.

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.400
That was pretty amazing.

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:52.800
And I know that probably made for horrible radio, but they really did show, they really

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:58.120
did show people like shooting at Close Range face, and then there was a horse and an ostrich.

02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.840
I just, I don't see the difference, isn't that every first person shooter game?

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.280
Ga-faw, ga-faw, ga-faw.

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:08.920
Anyhow, the Onion actually made it a game and submitted Close Range to sell on the App

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.040
Store.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.200
But Apple, I would have bought it, shit.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.360
But you know Loki's looking it up right now.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.600
No, I already saw that news report.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.440
We'll check the jailbreak for us.

02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:22.400
Apple rejected it due to violence.

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:27.960
However, they have, the Onion has revised the game and resubmitted it.

02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:29.480
But good luck.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:35.400
The iPad and iPhone App Stores prohibits apps portraying realistic images of people or animals

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.240
being killed or maimed, shot, stabbed, tortured or injured.

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:40.360
That didn't look really realistic.

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:42.920
That's awesome.

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.640
They must be on lots of crack to have that be their idea of realism.

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:53.420
Hey, also from Tiger Claw, I know he wants us to know that the SingStar Dance Track List

02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:54.420
is out.

02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:58.140
That's right, because now, with thanks to the PlayStation Move, not only do you get

02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.920
to sing, but you get to dance in SingStar.

02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:01.920
Yay.

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:05.040
Irene's really excited for my next SingStar party, aren't you?

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:06.040
Totally.

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:07.040
I can't wait.

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:10.440
Well, here's some of the hits you can do in this new game for SingStar Dance.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:16.880
In Sync, Bye Bye Bye, Blondie, Heart of Glass, Cyndi Lauper, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Gwen

02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:21.720
Stefani, Whatchu Waitin' For?, Casey and the Sunshine Band, That's the Way I Like It, La

02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:23.600
Rue with Bulletproof.

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:24.600
That's a popular one.

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.920
Lady Gaga with Poker Face, New Kids on the Block with Hangin' Tough, Paula Abdul was

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:37.000
Straight Up, Real Too Real with I Like to Move It, The Backstreet Boys with Everybody

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.120
Backstreet's Back, and Irene's personal favorite, The Black Eyed Peas with Shut Up.

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:44.720
Shut Up!

02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.720
Nuh-uh.

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:46.720
Great.

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:49.220
That's awesome.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:51.720
I'm pre-ordering that game right?

02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.720
Never.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:53.720
Alright.

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:55.600
That's it for the Twitter topic.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:57.880
Sorry to those folks that didn't get their tweets read.

02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.880
You'll just have to tweet us a little faster next time, won't you?

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:01.880
Back to some gaming news.

02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.440
Loki, I hate to tear you away from Plants vs. Zombies, but I'm thinking you might want

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.840
to read some stories for our listeners.

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.840
Sure, why not.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:10.800
Or we can just watch more Onion videos all night.

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.800
Onion Lounge Radio, really.

02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:12.800
You know, whatever.

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.800
It's better.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:19.200
Uh, EA apparently has not received significant backlash to their online pass.

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.000
Remember, the online pass is part of their Project 10 dollars, which is the dumbest name

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.880
for a project ever, and it charges 10 dollars for access to online games, or online modes

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:33.640
in games, if you purchase the game used.

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.600
It says, people know that bandwidth isn't free, so the fact that we are diffusing online

02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.880
costs isn't seen as unreasonable.

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.600
That makes no sense, I'll just say.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.860
In other words, people aren't complaining enough.

02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:50.860
So complain more.

02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:51.860
That's a dumb excuse.

02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.520
They're all, oh, bandwidth's not free.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.360
Well, here's the thing.

02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.600
They say it just like that, too, bandwidth's not free.

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.800
No, they say it more like this, bandwidth's not free!

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:06.560
Well, here's the problem, though.

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.400
People bought the game new to begin with.

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:14.920
So if, say, I bought a game for 60 dollars, and then sold it to Rob, or, you know, sold

02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.400
it back to GameStop, and then Rob bought a used copy, okay, there's still the same amount

02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.800
of people playing online, potentially.

02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:29.040
But, you see, they were robbed of the 60 dollar new game that that person might have potentially

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.040
bought.

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.900
It's still the same amount of people playing online.

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:35.640
They wouldn't have bought because it's 60 dollars, they buy used games because they're

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.400
cheaper, and they probably would have just pirated it.

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:44.860
Do I have to go down to their fucking offices with a basket of apples and show them, okay,

02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:49.720
if I give you an apple, or, okay, how many apples do you have?

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.720
You have one apple?

02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:51.720
Okay.

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:55.640
Say you sell the apple used back to GameStop, you have now zero apples.

02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:58.680
I don't think GameStop buys apples.

02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.680
It doesn't matter, okay?

02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:01.320
Although I'd like to see you try.

02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:02.320
Okay, so.

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:05.320
Yes, I'd like to sell back this apple.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.520
Um, sir, we don't buy apples.

02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:15.720
So, EA, I purchased this apple from you, okay, for 60 dollars.

02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:18.200
You have my 60 dollars, okay?

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:22.560
I take this apple and give it to my friend, Rob, okay?

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.700
Rob has not paid you 60 dollars, but he'll be using this apple to play online.

02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:31.720
I will no longer be playing online with this apple because I don't have an apple anymore.

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:33.520
How many people are playing online with this apple?

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:36.760
Wait, wait, wait, but you said you brought a basket of apples, so you actually have like

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.760
20 more apples sitting in the basket.

02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:41.680
Exactly, and I've paid for all those copies of the games, Brandon.

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:43.760
I want to see these amazing online apples.

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:46.720
I'm just gonna go online and download the apple for free.

02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:49.200
That's what I'm gonna do.

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:51.680
It comes down to it, that's just a dumb excuse.

02:05:51.680 --> 02:06:00.160
That would be like saying, um, oh, let's see here, Rob, um, you know, I went ahead and

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:03.760
made this nice dinner out of food that I purchased from the grocery store.

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:07.200
However, for you to eat that dinner, you're gonna have to pay that grocery store 10 dollars

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:13.760
because, you know, they lost out the sales of you purchasing food from the grocery store,

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:19.600
despite the fact that they still have the same amount of food in the grocery store,

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:21.600
you know, regardless.

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.120
They've lost no money.

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.480
I will not.

02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.000
My voice must be heard.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.720
The problem is they're not fighting, they're basically just, you know, saying, oh, well,

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:37.320
you know, bandwidth costs money, and gamers are like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:43.200
Instead of going, wait a second, I paid them for that bandwidth already.

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:48.900
Going to a chat room at chat.orangesontraday.com, Spassinator PSN says, that's like GM complaining

02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:51.920
that a car dealership sells used cars.

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:57.320
Dark Tetsuya says, wow, I haven't heard Loki say Apple this much since his latest Mac rant.

02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:00.800
Dark Tetsuya says, Apple Lounge Radio.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:11.240
And lastly, Segg says, but I'm sure they sell lemons.

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:16.760
Here's my answer to why they haven't seen that much backlash yet as far as the online

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:21.600
passing goes, because not a lot of people buy EA Sports games used.

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:25.320
I'm guessing that most people buy them brand new when they first come out because they

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.520
have to have their EA Sports games.

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:31.200
And I'm sure that a lot of people that have bought EA Sports games are probably only buying

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:38.520
one or two EA Sports games, not everybody's buying Tiger, NCAA Football, Madden, NHL,

02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:42.000
no one's buying everything.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.040
So I'm going to guess that's probably why that no one's bitching about it, but I bet

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:49.720
you anything if this comes out a Medal of Honor or something like that and a bunch of

02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:55.080
people are buying it used later on, there will be people bitching.

02:07:55.080 --> 02:08:00.600
Xam in our chat room says, Apple's online, the latest fruit-based MMORPG following Fruit

02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.720
Base Fantasy XI and Papaya Star Online.

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:08.360
But remember, see, if you don't speak up, then they're just going to assume that everything

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:12.320
is okay, so, you know, whatever.

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:13.320
We tried, we tried.

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.400
Of course, their sales aren't going to hurt at all because, you know, Madden's going to

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:22.080
be the top selling game, but like if you know EA, say, for example, puts out, I don't know,

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:28.800
an MMO version of, like, Littlest Pet Shop or something like that and charges $10 for

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:32.400
online, I'm sure a lot of people won't buy, well actually fuck that, no one's going to

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:33.400
buy that game anyways.

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:35.600
What am I talking about?

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:37.840
Little girls everywhere want that game.

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.680
No, they have Hello Kitty online.

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:43.000
Fine, you're right, EA, you should be charging more for online.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.560
In fact, you should charge them $120.

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.000
Why stop at $10?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
That's just ridiculous.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.480
How about $10 a month?

02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:55.280
In fact, I think you should charge them whatever year it is, so, you know, $2010, $2010 to

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.320
get online.

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:58.880
That sounds reasonable.

02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:04.360
Hey, going over to the Kinect and Microsoft, some news about the whole camera scanning

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.120
feature that's going on there.

02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:11.160
You remember when they first showed Kinect, in that whole little Milo demo, they showed

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:15.000
like, ooh, I'm going to draw Milo a picture and put it up on the camera and he's going

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
to, like, show me-

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.200
That's a wonderful penis you've drawn for me!

02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.280
Pretty much was the demo they were showing, right?

02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:26.280
But then when they actually showed the games you could play, it was all flail 2000 and

02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.840
dance and wave my hands.

02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:33.720
And there really was nothing about, oh, it reads paper or any of that stuff, right?

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:34.720
Well-

02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:39.300
Have you, by the way, not the, this is still about Milo, have you seen the new Milo demo

02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:41.200
video that they had out there?

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:46.120
It was, I forget what conference is being shown at, but it, and this isn't like a bad

02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:51.240
joke or anything, they were actually showing it, apparently he's like moved to the US because

02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:54.920
his family is having, they're conflicting or something like that.

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.520
But the thing is, is like you're outside, you're following him around and helping him

02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.720
find snails and stuff like that and talking to this little kid and he has to like run

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.080
inside his house and stuff.

02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.240
And to me it seems like kind of like a first person version of like some creepy pedophile

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:11.760
that's hiding in your yard, you know, talking to this little boy.

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:12.760
Pedobear of the game.

02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:15.480
Seriously, it's Pedobear of the game.

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.240
Anyways, back to the scanning stuff.

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.080
Maybe now's not a good time to talk about Kinect Joyride, which is the game I was actually

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.080
going to talk about.

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.680
They were showing off a demo of this at Tokyo Game Show.

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.640
Big Park, the developers behind Joyride, which is a Microsoft owned studio, they actually

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:35.640
have worked in some of the camera capture into this game.

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:40.400
Here's the weird thing, what it does, when you do your vehicle customization options,

02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:42.140
you can pick your car's color.

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:46.960
But if you don't like the colors in the game, Kinect will look at an item that you put in

02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:51.560
front of the camera and put its color on the car.

02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:57.640
So how long until a car that is colored the same color as someone's penis?

02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:59.640
That's what I want to know.

02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:04.800
That's really cool.

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:07.600
That's the wonders of modern technology.

02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.600
It matches colors.

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.600
Good job.

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.600
Cocky.

02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:20.880
By the way, you could also capture textures and that whole thing in LittleBigPlanet.

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:25.480
Also by the way, last year or two years ago, I would already read pictures in front of

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.000
the Playstation Eye.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.280
This actually isn't anything new, just so you know.

02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:31.280
Thanks Rob.

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.280
You're welcome.

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:33.280
Dark Sakura!

02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:35.800
We have something that's a little bit more fun than that.

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.760
You can hack your shoes into Wiimotes.

02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:45.000
Basically this guy named Nick Marsh hacked his Nike shoes, they specifically say Nike,

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:51.260
ooh, to make Wii controllers as part of the Nike 78 project, where they asked 78 artists

02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.000
to be creative with their shoes.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.040
So what it does is actually it changes the way a lot of these games are played.

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:10.040
I think that he's using Wii Sports or one of these balance board games and using a chair

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:14.080
so he's jumping up and down for doing the little dance thing.

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.960
And then, but it looks like he can actually do the running and play stuff.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:23.280
It looks like he's having an epileptic seizure, like I'm sorry.

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:27.120
I'm just waiting for that dog in that one video to come out and push the chair before

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:28.120
he sits down.

02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:30.520
When he falls on his ass, have you guys seen this video?

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.520
It's great.

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:37.440
But I mean, it looks like though it totally adds a lot more of a different dimension to

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:38.440
the game.

02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:39.440
I mean, like it could be more active.

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:41.440
Oh, it's Wii Boxing.

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.920
Oh, is that what it is?

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.560
Well, no, he's doing Wii Aerobics or something.

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:45.560
No, he's doing the dancing, whatever.

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:46.560
The dancing one.

02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:47.560
On stage.

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:51.480
It looks like somebody is like shooting bullets at his feet.

02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:52.480
That's what it looks like.

02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:54.240
I think it's neat though.

02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:55.240
I think it's really cool.

02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.240
I'm a maniac, maniac.

02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:58.520
That's what it looks like.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.120
Yeah, I guess if you want to look more ridiculous doing stuff on the Wii, yeah.

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.400
But I mean, when he wasn't using the chair, it did look like he was actually kind of dancing

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:10.960
along with the people on the screen instead of just using the balance board, you know?

02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:13.080
It looked like it would be fun.

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.840
It was just weird that he had to keep sitting on that chair, but you know, whatever.

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:18.080
It's like using the bar in DDR.

02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.320
Not going to judge, not going to judge.

02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.000
Mailbag and the FUs of the Wii coming up after just a couple more stories.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Loki.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Yes.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.600
And apparently there's a new game coming out called Shadows of the Damned.

02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.800
You said a bad word.

02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:37.160
Yes I did.

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:45.120
Apparently this is the long awaited collaboration of Suda51, Akami, and EA.

02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:51.200
And of course this new game is going to be a psychological action thriller.

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:52.200
And he said-

02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.160
There's some Shadows of the Damned going on in the next room, right?

02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:00.600
According to Suda, he said he and Akami wanted to make this game for a long time.

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.360
He searched for the right publisher to bring it to the audience.

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.600
Finally, they said that they can reveal the game they've been working on together with

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:07.600
EA.

02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:10.760
It's expected to release in 2011.

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:13.680
And yeah, it's pretty cool.

02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.840
I know he was working on another game also, which is kind of cool.

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.080
And I believe Akira Yomoka is doing music for that one.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:22.080
So that's pretty sweet.

02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080
What?

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:28.240
Yeah, well Akira Yomoka left Konami and he's supposedly partnering with EA now, so this

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:29.240
makes sense.

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:30.240
Bravo!

02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.240
Akira Yomoka.

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:33.880
This is going to be a heck of a game, but we don't know anything but a title, right?

02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.320
Nothing right now, yeah.

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.320
Not even a screenshot.

02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:37.320
Nothing.

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.320
Nothing.

02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:41.560
It's going to be all like stick figures and psychological action.

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:44.160
It'll probably be a big thing at E3 next year, I'm imagining.

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:47.100
Oh, like Shattered Memories was?

02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:49.160
That was a psychological thriller.

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.400
But that also was a different developer.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.120
It wasn't an EA game.

02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.520
I know, it was shit.

02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:55.520
I heard.

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.960
I heard your strong feelings about this earlier.

02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:02.480
Speaking of things that Irene is a big fan of, it was officially announced this week

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:07.440
through Mila Jovovich that another Resident Evil movie is definitely coming.

02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:08.440
What do you mean?

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:10.200
With that like open ending?

02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:11.200
No!

02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.640
Surely you just.

02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.000
Quote Mila Jovovich in the New York magazine, quote, this new Resident Evil is the first

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.800
one to ever open at number one worldwide.

02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:22.640
It's the biggest movie in the franchise.

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:25.400
So we're definitely going to make another one.

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:31.380
She's also asking fans to send suggestions for the next film to her Twitter page.

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:37.300
So if you want to tweet her and tell her some ideas, like make a movie that doesn't suck,

02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:42.480
you could tweet her at M-I-L-L-A J-O-V-O-V-I-C-H.

02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:45.200
Because you don't know how to spell it.

02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:46.200
Alright.

02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.840
Suggestion, do not make another movie.

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.800
Thank you.

02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:54.640
You need to get a Twitter account just to tweet that to her.

02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:56.320
I liked the last ones, honestly.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.720
I haven't seen the very last one, but I want to.

02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:00.840
Yeah, I didn't mind the first three movies.

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:05.440
The third one was kind of, but this one was just pretty horrible.

02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.040
Speaking of Resident Evil movies, there's going to be another CG Resident Evil movie

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:12.720
called Damnation.

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:19.120
It's going to be released in Japan in 2012 and I guess it's 3D.

02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:24.880
Z-Generation has shipped over 1.6 million copies for home viewing and it only had a

02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:29.840
very limited release in Japan in the theaters and it grossed about $480,000 which is really

02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:30.840
good.

02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.400
40 million yen if you want to be technical.

02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.900
So there you go, another CG Resident Evil movie coming called Damnation and that's probably

02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:41.400
what Irene is going to say again if she has to see it in 3D.

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:42.400
Pretty much.

02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:44.360
Are we ready to get to the mailbag?

02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:45.560
Let's do it, Rob.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:50.160
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelauntraded.com is the place to send

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:51.160
them to.

02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:55.760
We open up the mailbag and find a few of our favorites and read them live on air and Dark

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.760
Soccer will make fun of your grammar.

02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:59.520
Yes I will.

02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:02.480
Okay, this comes from Rini.

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.280
Hi Rini!

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:05.280
Greetings O.L.R.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:10.260
On episode 8, I'm sorry 381, you lamented over Guitar Hero Warrior of Rock's ability

02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:12.520
to post accomplishments on Twitter and Facebook.

02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:13.520
We did?

02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:14.520
Oh.

02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:18.840
I didn't mention Rock Band 3 also has media integration features, but they have a bit

02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:19.840
of use.

02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:23.400
For example, you can make a setlist and post it for friends to see or try out.

02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:26.120
Of course you can throttle the frequency of posts.

02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:30.980
Another concern with Rock Band 3 is promo DLC, which is going to be separate from standard

02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:32.080
DLC.

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.160
Just to clarify, this pro DLC is only for guitar and bass.

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:38.160
Pro keys and drums are included in the normal DLC.

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:43.240
There's a lot more interesting details I could just gloss over, but rather than tired poor

02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:47.320
Dark Soccer's windpipes, I'll just link you guys to a few sources to skim over interesting

02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:52.000
details if you want to bring up such as harmonics, making older DLC compatible with keys in pro

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
mode.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
So yeah, different stuff.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.520
All stuff coming out of packs.

02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:00.760
I am really excited, I actually did not pick up on the fact that pro keys was going to

02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:01.760
be just included.

02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.760
That actually makes me really happy.

02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:05.760
I'm smiling.

02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:10.000
You just can't see it because it's radio, but I'm smiling.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.840
Next email, Hey Orange Dones Radio, Haseo Sumi-Ragawa, here for the third time in this

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:14.840
Lovely Marathon episode.

02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:15.840
So this was, yeah, last week.

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.360
This must be an old one.

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:21.520
Okay, in an earlier episode I asked about a problem with downloading Bleach Heat The

02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:22.800
Soul 6.

02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.720
And you guys said be more detailed, so here it is.

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:28.560
Okay, Bleach Heat The Soul 6 is a PSP game.

02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:31.360
I downloaded it and it was a RAR file.

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:36.240
Oh, you downloaded a fake.

02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.880
Can't help him with that unless he gets into something a little more legitimate.

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.480
I don't want to pay the extra cost of importing at $60, which is a bit ridiculous considering

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.640
the extra $20 for next day shipping so they can kiss my butt on that front.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:51.640
Actually...

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:55.440
You can buy, by the way, import PSP games at Fry's.

02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.520
I actually, I'm going to take shit for this, but I don't care.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:00.520
I've said it on the show before.

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:03.880
I'm not opposed to pirating importing games, imported games actually.

02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:07.760
Because I think if they are not going to take a chance and release it over here, then why

02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:12.380
should we pay all this money in import fees to when they're not counting on us for their

02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:13.380
success anyway?

02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:14.380
You know what I mean?

02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:19.960
Like, I know that's going to be frowned upon by some people, but I really don't pirate

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.080
games here in the US, but the import ones, yeah, I have.

02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.560
Thanks for reading my email, loyal listener Samir Agala.

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:32.440
PS, people are wondering, I got the name from Haseo from.hack//G.U. series.

02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:36.080
Samir Agala from the ReadOrDieTV anime, yes, I know it's a woman's last name, it doesn't

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.800
really matter whose last name it is, but F you to all who have a problem with that.

02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:40.800
Thanks again.

02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:46.520
Also, if you can't help me via the radio, please do send a reply.

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.520
Forward it to Loki.

02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.520
Loki can trick the mailbox.

02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:58.000
Okay, now, okay, this is from Robboy, from Robaba.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.800
Now wait a minute, with all the halos and modern, no, more violence drops impossible.

02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:03.600
Okay, that's what it's called.

02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:07.200
Now wait a minute, with all the halos and modern warfares, crimes should be way up according

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:09.720
to the whack job anti-game protesters, right?

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:12.480
Not so in, and there's an article from Bennington Banner.

02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:16.680
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report Monday on crime statistics for 2009

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:23.880
that showed a 5.3% drop in violent crimes nationwide and a 4.6% drop in property crimes.

02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:28.280
I'll be honest that they didn't define the drop context, whether it's per capita or total

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:32.840
crimes, but all of these violent games poisoning our minds should turn us into gun-toting cold-blooded

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.840
killers.

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:37.560
I personally believe that not just games, but media and software use in general may

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:40.760
be indirectly causing the drop.

02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:45.600
Watching TV, playing games, browsing the intertubes, texting on our phones, and other sedentary

02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.160
activities are keeping us inside.

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:51.760
Not just that, and here's where I get a little controversial, I believe that violence is

02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:55.600
inversely correlated with average weight.

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.920
Think about it, the more you are overweight, the less mayhem you'll be willing to do.

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:04.880
Fat equals peace, maybe that's stretching it, or discrimination right there, or stretch

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:09.560
pantsing it.

02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:13.720
Everyone slowly step away from Rob.

02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:18.160
I'm trying to think if I've ever seen on the news, like somebody who committed a really

02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:23.760
horrible crime and if they were fat, like I'm, I'm sure there's been a few fatties.

02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:26.160
There's been.

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:27.160
You're the you in your plan.

02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:29.360
The guy who shot John Lennon was pretty fat, if I remember right, so.

02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:30.360
Oh yeah.

02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:32.280
And that was a really recent story too, so.

02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:35.400
And I was commenting on the fact that you're like seven pounds, Rob, I wasn't saying you're

02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:36.400
fat, it was the opposite.

02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.400
Slim Jim over here.

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.400
It's from Rob-a-ba.

02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:41.160
Anyway, next email.

02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.400
Okay, this is from somebody.

02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:49.160
Hey guys, I've been listening to this show for a year now, my first episode being the

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:50.160
fuck show.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.680
Anyways, I have something word to share with you.

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:59.480
The very day after you guys had Omen in the Cage match, DJ Hero posted a clip of it on

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.480
YouTube.

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:01.480
Coincidence?

02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:02.880
I think not, XD.

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:05.880
But one more thing.

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:10.040
Is that song you use at the end of the show every weekend behind the but we're probably

02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:11.040
right anyway message?

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:12.680
I can't find it anywhere, thanks.

02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:14.200
That's just the closing time midi.

02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.160
It's an 8-bit remix of closing time.

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:19.140
There was some website, I don't even know where it came from because it was actually

02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:22.280
sent to me by a friend and I was like, hey, we'll make that the closing theme of our show.

02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:23.760
And this is from Andy.

02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:28.300
I believe some website did like a compilation of a bunch of 8-bit versions of songs.

02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:29.960
You could probably find it on YouTube.

02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:33.720
Just Google like YouTube 8-bit closing time, you'll find it.

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:34.720
But that's it.

02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:35.720
And what was it?

02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:36.720
There was another part of the question?

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:37.720
No.

02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:38.720
Oh.

02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:39.720
No.

02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:40.720
Well, I made it through the whole marathon podcast.

02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:41.720
Thanks for all the effort.

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:44.200
And as I think would be appropriate, here's the marathon email.

02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:47.680
It's shorter than 11 hours though, so you can stop grimacing, you misspelled my name

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:48.680
dude.

02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:50.420
I'm looking at you.

02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:53.860
First of all, just to raise the bar, I thought I'd let you know that this week we're getting

02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:56.580
a five, yes, five-day weekend in Mexico.

02:22:56.580 --> 02:23:01.440
Since we're deep in bicentennial celebration, high five, act deaf, viva Mexico.

02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:06.040
My best geek moment was definitely when both of my kids, six and eight, actually requested

02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:08.320
I run a D&D campaign for them.

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:11.240
Now we're playing the Diceless Marvel RPG.

02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:15.300
As for anger management moments, my one real fight with my mom was when I was growing up.

02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:19.340
At 14, she came into my room and just turned off my SNES because she thought I had had

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.600
enough video games for the day.

02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:23.780
Well, I thought differently and actually took her by the shoulders and proceeded to gently

02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:27.840
but firmly explain as I took her out of my room, locked the door and turned my console

02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:28.960
back on again.

02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:31.280
She never bothered me with time limits after that.

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.280
Wow.

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:33.280
Wow.

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:38.320
Finally, I've done the math and considering my OLR cherry was popped somewhere in the

02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.320
to-go era.

02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.760
Is this guy skinny?

02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:42.760
Let me finish.

02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:43.760
All right.

02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:44.760
Episode number now forgotten.

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:48.360
I'm not listed in the wiki, but it was the one where Rob came out of the closet for the

02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:49.720
audience.

02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:58.040
I've now listened to at least episode one.

02:23:58.040 --> 02:23:59.360
Not the gaydar Rob.

02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:04.420
Just actually saying it actually might have been a while because I think at the beginning

02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:09.000
of the show, I actually purposely didn't want to say anything because not that I was ashamed

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
of it.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
I'm certainly not, but it's just kind of one of those, like, I was like, it's not your

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
business.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
It doesn't matter for a while.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.440
I had a change of heart and well to finish this email.

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:19.440
Sorry.

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:26.600
I've now listened to at least 245 episodes or if you prefer 621.5 hours, 2.5 hours a

02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:28.280
pop of OLR.

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:30.640
That's over 25 days of entertainment from you.

02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.320
So I'll just go ahead and thank you for one of the best months of my life and call it

02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:36.440
even for the next few episodes.

02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:37.440
Okay.

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:38.440
Gracias.

02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:39.440
Muchas gracias.

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.080
Sincerely, Dr. Noir, AKA the other Mexican recruit.

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:47.680
PS, this mail has been reviewed by two separate automated spelling and grammar sensors and

02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.560
proofread by two young goats, which were then sacrificed to the bard in order to keep the

02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:52.960
dark goddess appeased.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:57.280
For the record, my name is spelled J-A-M-I-E, but thank you for trying.

02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:59.320
You know, it's funny.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:01.120
And people in other countries get a bye.

02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:02.120
Yes.

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:03.120
Yes they do.

02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:04.520
But I have to tell you this.

02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:11.320
My name was never, my first name was never misspelled until I moved to California.

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:12.320
Interesting.

02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:16.480
I'm just saying, people in Alabama can spell my name right.

02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:20.120
Next email.

02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:22.040
And this is another one from Rababa.

02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:24.880
I got what I believe can only be a phishing scam.

02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:30.860
I get an email from spoofed Blizzard inviting me to a beta of the next WoW expansion.

02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:34.460
The link is probably to a fake WoW login server because it didn't actually start with a Blizzard

02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:36.200
or WoW address.

02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:39.160
Also I don't even have a WoW account which made it extra fishy.

02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:40.680
PSA complete.

02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:47.280
I also got to play Dark Sakura Sunday because I got nauseous playing TrackMania.

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:48.280
Later Rababa.

02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:50.200
No, it sounds legit to me.

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:51.560
Yeah, you know what's funny?

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.920
I get emails all the time for Ion online.

02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:58.560
Like, you know, log in and get free gold for Ion online and I'm like, I don't even play

02:25:58.560 --> 02:25:59.560
dude.

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.960
It's like, I don't have an account but okay, I'm gonna go do it right now.

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:05.000
By the way, I have to tell you what Tiara said.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.320
If you've got import problems, Rob Bill's bad for you son.

02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:09.920
He's got 99 problems but a pirate ain't one.

02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:13.560
Oh, a happy talk like a pirate day to you too.

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:14.560
Arr.

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.560
Arr.

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:16.560
Arr.

02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:17.560
Arr.

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:18.560
Arr.

02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:19.560
Arr.

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:20.560
Arr.

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:21.560
Uh, yeah.

02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:22.560
Derailed.

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:23.560
Keelhaul.

02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:24.560
Next email.

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:25.560
That's it.

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:30.680
Oh, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:32.320
The futures!

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:43.720
But the present brings the angst and the FUs of the week.

02:26:43.720 --> 02:27:04.480
Here is justice, here is punishment, here is the fog of the day.

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:05.480
Darkstalker.

02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:06.480
Um, FU to, um, Algebra.

02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:07.480
Loki.

02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:08.480
Second back.

02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:09.480
Um, I'd say FU to, um, well actually I've got quite a few this week.

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:12.680
Um, FU to Ford for making really shitty cars.

02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:19.200
I've had to replace, um, the, uh, thermostat housing on my car about three times now because

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.800
it keeps breaking, because it's made of plastic, and because it gets cracks in it because it

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:27.760
oxidizes and that sucks.

02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:29.720
And it's about $300 each time.

02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:35.680
So FU to that, um, FU to people that, while they're grocery shopping, aren't paying attention

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.120
to where the hell they are and they're totally blocking the aisle, they have their cart on

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.160
one side and they're just browsing, totally oblivious to the world on the other side,

02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:49.400
or they have, like, kids running around and stuff like that, you know, so FU to them.

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:57.160
And people that like to, um, I guess participate in idle chit-chat in the grocery lines.

02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:58.160
Thank you.

02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:03.760
Um, my FU of the week, I'm putting this in for Alan, goes to Del Taco.

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:07.920
Um, no, I have a good reason, because we actually went over to the drive-thru to get him a quick

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:09.600
lunch that he could take on the train with him.

02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:14.120
Yeah, we sat in the drive-thru for 35 minutes, uh, before we finally got our food and, uh,

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.160
he missed his train as a result.

02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:20.320
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to have him here an extra day, but, you know,

02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:24.880
he had things he wanted to do, so, kind of irritating when they take a very, very long

02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:25.880
time.

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.040
What was their explanation?

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:28.040
They didn't really have one.

02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.040
Huh.

02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:30.040
They were just busy.

02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:31.040
Ow.

02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:33.040
I know, right?

02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.040
So otherwise, FU to the fact that I have to get up at six in the morning tomorrow.

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:38.040
Ugh.

02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:39.040
Wham.

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:40.040
Sad.

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:41.880
Do you have any FUs of the weak rice princess?

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:47.480
Yeah, FU to everything 3D, and, uh, FU to stinky farts.

02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:48.480
Uh.

02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:49.480
Excuse me.

02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:51.480
That about covers it.

02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:52.480
The doctor?

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:57.560
FU to 3D as well, because I hate 3D forever, pound it, explosion.

02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.520
And also, FU to American TV for not having as many gay kisses as British TV.

02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:04.760
Bring on the gay kisses, American TV.

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:06.480
I'll show you a gay kiss right now.

02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.320
Whoa, oh my god, they really kissed.

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:11.840
They did it.

02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:14.840
Alan, they totally kissed.

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:15.840
Alright.

02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:21.360
Couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:22.360
on Skype, orange launcher.

02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:23.840
I should probably boot Skype, huh?

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:25.960
But not yet, because we still got two more stories to go.

02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:32.280
Yes, who would have thought that D3 would announce that they're releasing Earth Defense

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:35.040
Force Insect Armageddon.

02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:36.040
Really?

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:38.840
On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:46.400
Wow, that's wonderful news that I wish I knew earlier, but didn't know it until just now.

02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:49.080
And they did release a little teaser, which is pretty awesome.

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:54.160
It's gonna be developed now by the people that did, and I don't know if this is a bad

02:29:54.160 --> 02:30:01.600
thing or not, the people that did the EAT LED Return of Matt Hazard game.

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:03.360
But the way I look at it, like this, okay?

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:08.040
The original Earth Defense Force 2017 game was pretty crappy.

02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:13.980
When you look at all the development side of it, I mean, the game had no physics.

02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:18.120
The game was very laggy.

02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:19.420
It was just fun, though.

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:20.460
And this game looks fun, too.

02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:23.160
It's supposed to take place now in New Detroit.

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:28.420
The graphics are updated, and by the screenshot, looks like we get the jetpack from number

02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:30.660
two, which is pretty awesome.

02:30:30.660 --> 02:30:35.240
So I am very looking forward to this game, it's supposed to be coming out in February.

02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:37.400
SSG100Matt says, the game is doomed!

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:39.520
And he actually says, doomed!

02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:41.160
It's gonna be awesome.

02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.360
I don't care.

02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:46.000
Well, I had no idea this game was gonna be coming out.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:50.680
And I'm really happy that no one seemed to care that Loki, you know...

02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:55.240
Loki is saying this for the very first time, I mean, on this program.

02:30:55.240 --> 02:31:00.280
One more news story for you guys, and it has to do with a new world record in video games!

02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:01.280
Sweet!

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:02.280
Sweet!

02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:04.000
And the winner is Mafia 2!

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Yay!

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.520
And what did Mafia 2 get?

02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:14.160
Well, Mafia 2 uses the word fuck more than any other video game!

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:15.160
Yay!

02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:16.160
Yay!

02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:19.840
They won the award for most swearing in a video game.

02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:20.840
That's right.

02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:21.840
Fuck yeah.

02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:22.840
The fuck they did!

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:28.640
Um, uh, House of the Dead Overkill was the previous title that had 189 uses of the word

02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:29.640
fuck.

02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:34.000
Like, well, you know, fuck, or fucking, or motherfucker, all of that.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:47.560
But now, apparently, um, Mafia 2 has more than 200 instances of fuck.

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:48.560
What the fuck did you say?

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.560
I couldn't hear.

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:51.560
I was talking.

02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:52.640
Congratulations.

02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:58.640
I mean, you guys, that's just really immature, to say fuck as many times as possible in a

02:31:58.640 --> 02:31:59.640
short period.

02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:00.640
That's really immature.

02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:01.640
Because we've never had a fuck show.

02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:02.640
No.

02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:03.640
No.

02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:04.640
No.

02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:05.640
That we would never stoop so loud.

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:06.640
That would be fucking ridiculous.

02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:07.640
That would be extremely fucking immature.

02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:11.320
And we would never do anything like that because, you know, we're intelligent gamers.

02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:12.320
We're classy.

02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:13.320
We're classy.

02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:15.680
Stop saying fuck.

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:17.360
Classy like the playboys that were in Mafia 2.

02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:20.080
Why don't you give us a call and we'll talk?

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:24.440
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:26.640
We'll let Rice Princess answer all the calls tonight.

02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:27.640
Is that sounding fun?

02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:28.640
Can I answer the calls tonight?

02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:29.640
Yeah.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.640
Sure.

02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:31.640
I'm classy as fuck.

02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:32.640
All right.

02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:34.760
Rice Princess is going to answer all the calls for us tonight.

02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:41.400
So call and talk to Rice Princess at 1-877-GAME-OLR and she will talk to our listeners.

02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:44.080
And don't ask me anything stupid.

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:46.000
I'll jump in and help if you need it.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Okay.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I'll answer the stupid questions.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Okay.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Just say, Rob, this is a stupid question.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Help me out.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
No, don't make the listeners feel bad.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.600
Can I just give you a signal like, Rob, this is a stupid question.

02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:56.600
Yeah, she can.

02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:57.600
Okay.

02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:58.600
Here we go.

02:32:58.600 --> 02:32:59.600
We got a call coming in.

02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:00.600
You ready?

02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:01.600
Yeah.

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:02.600
Hi.

02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:03.600
You're on.

02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:04.600
OLR person.

02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:05.600
Hi.

02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:06.600
Select the Zaku right here.

02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:07.600
Hi.

02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:08.600
Yeah.

02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:09.600
I know.

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.600
I thought Sky was going to be on, but.

02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:11.600
Oh, sorry.

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:12.840
This is a stupid question, Rob.

02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:14.320
I guess you should take over.

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:15.320
Zaku.

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:21.600
Well, I did IMU within the chat and I have good reason to be here tonight.

02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:22.600
All right.

02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:23.600
What's your good reason?

02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:28.800
You know, I actually attended that Halo Reach launch party that Best Buy threw last week,

02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:29.800
you know, in the city.

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:31.680
I actually got in as VIP.

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.680
Ooh.

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:33.680
Let's just say.

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:36.120
How did you get in as VIP, fancy pants?

02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:39.760
Let's just say it's through the company I work for.

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:41.440
And they actually do business for Best Buy.

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:44.900
They actually build some of their apps for stuff like reward zones.

02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:46.920
So you had to give a reach around for reach?

02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:48.360
No, I actually got in.

02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:49.360
Okay.

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:50.920
I actually got in through those connections.

02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:55.440
But yeah, pretty much it was just typical fanfare launch party with a lot of people

02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:57.400
trying to get in VIP.

02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:02.240
But most of the folks, all it was is just like playing Halo Reach before midnight.

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:03.280
Wait, wait, wait.

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.000
What did the VIP people get?

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
What made you?

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.120
Well, I already know you're VIP because you listen to this show.

02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:15.080
But what did VIP get that the little peons waiting in line did not get?

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.080
Did you get the strip bus?

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.580
A full service bar.

02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:18.920
We had our own balcony section.

02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:19.920
Stuff like that.

02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:20.920
A full service bar.

02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:21.920
A full service bar.

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:22.920
Yes, exactly.

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:27.320
Yeah, we had a full bar.

02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.320
So how many people were there?

02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:31.200
What did they do that was, did they have like a rock concert?

02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:32.200
I don't know.

02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:33.200
What did they do?

02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:37.800
One person, I forgot his name, Kid Cutter or something, he was supposed to have played,

02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:41.440
but he didn't play exactly, you know, before midnight.

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:45.360
But by the time, you know, we left after midnight, he actually got on stage.

02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:51.120
There's something about him just like being, you know, the unprofessional artist that he

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:54.600
He opened for Lady Gaga once when I saw her and he's that guy.

02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:55.600
He just, day and night.

02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:56.600
That's him.

02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:57.600
Yeah.

02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:58.600
Something like that.

02:34:58.600 --> 02:34:59.600
I don't care.

02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:00.600
Okay.

02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:03.600
He had the crack song in DJ Hero.

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.600
Day and night.

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:05.600
Okay.

02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:07.600
We heard you the first time, Rob.

02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:10.400
You sure you didn't do the song?

02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:15.940
It was just like, it was basically free, you know, free swag, free liquor, free food, playing

02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:17.200
Halo Reach.

02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:20.480
One of my friends manages, you know, managed to like win a couple of rounds.

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:24.560
I still suck at, you know, at twitch shooters, on controllers.

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:26.160
I can't do the sticks.

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:30.720
So that's pretty much the highlight of that night and just getting drunk.

02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:31.720
Were there strippers?

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:32.720
On a Monday night.

02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:34.720
Were there strippers?

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.360
No, there weren't any strippers unless you count all the fanboys that were actually,

02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:47.200
you know, donning Halo, Halo, you know, clothing, such as the plasma swords and whatnot.

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.840
How many women were in line for Halo Reach compared to men?

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:51.720
There was a lot of people outside, actually.

02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:53.520
It was literally stretching around the block.

02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:54.520
He's dodging the quest.

02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:57.440
But they were, they were outside and not actually in the line waiting to buy the game, right?

02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:58.440
They were still inside, though.

02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:00.280
There was, there were people waiting to get in.

02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:01.280
That's the thing.

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:02.280
Oh, okay.

02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:03.280
It was like a, you know,

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:06.200
But you got to sit up on the balcony and just judge them all, right?

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:07.880
Of course, because you know what?

02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:09.840
I had, you know, I was connected.

02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:14.760
As I said, I work for the company, our company does business with Best Buy, so they hooked

02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:15.920
us up.

02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:17.920
So I thank them for that.

02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:18.920
All right.

02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:24.840
But yeah, I mean, aside from that little escapade that I had, I want to talk about, you know,

02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:31.200
about the fact that, let me see, Konami basically, you know, started to think outside the box

02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:36.720
for a change in terms of like taking arcade concepts that God knows will not succeed in

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:40.160
this nation and trying to take advantage of other platforms.

02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:42.360
Let me guess, you're talking about U-Beat?

02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:48.640
Yes, on the iPad, which makes a lot, a lot of sense, given the fact that it's touch-based

02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:50.680
and the platform is there.

02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:55.080
That means arcade owners, you know, as much as, you know, as much as I respect them, they

02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:59.620
won't have to shell out, you know, tons of money for something that may or may not succeed

02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:00.620
on that medium.

02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:07.440
And it's a lot, in other words, you could catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:08.440
That's good.

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.480
I mean, it's a good, look, I'm more of an Android developer, but even though I have

02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:17.320
an iPod touch, I do respect the platform, but I don't like the way they, you know, I

02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:18.680
don't like Apple censoring.

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:20.400
How much do you think they'll charge for U-Beat?

02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:21.400
99 cents?

02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:22.400
$4.99?

02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:24.440
I'm pretty certain it'll be $5 at most.

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:25.440
You know what they'll do?

02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:28.520
I bet you it's like 99 cents and then like a dollar a song.

02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:29.520
Yes, exactly.

02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:30.800
They're doing DDRS.

02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:31.800
Gross.

02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:36.080
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but any other thoughts on

02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:37.080
the Halo Reach party?

02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:41.320
If you could sum up the Halo Reach launch party and your VIP access in one word, what

02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:42.320
would it be?

02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:43.320
Sausage.

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.320
Damn.

02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.120
Damn good time for free.

02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:49.360
That's too many words.

02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:50.360
Have a good night.

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:51.360
Alright.

02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:52.360
Night.

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:53.360
Alright.

02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:56.680
877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangelaunchradio if you'd like to give us

02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:00.320
a call and tell us about your VIP treatment.

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:01.320
And full service.

02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:02.320
Whoa.

02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:03.320
I know, right?

02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:04.320
Fancy schmancy.

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:05.320
Fancy schmancy.

02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:06.320
Hi.

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:07.320
You're on Orangelaunchradio.

02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:08.320
Who's this?

02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:09.320
It's Con.

02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:10.320
Hi, whatever you said.

02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:11.320
What's your question?

02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:27.840
I was wondering if you guys had heard about the Fable 3 book that's going to be published.

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:28.840
Cool.

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:29.840
Continue.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:31.840
No, he asked a question, dummy.

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:32.840
Cool.

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:33.840
Continue.

02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:34.840
The Fable 3 book.

02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:35.840
What about it?

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.920
That's going to be, actually, I don't know much about this either.

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:39.920
Tell us about it.

02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:41.640
Is it going to be a fantasy book?

02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:44.480
Yeah, it's actually not Fable 3.

02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:49.280
It's going to be taking place between Fable 2 and Fable 3.

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:53.800
And when you purchase the book, it'll have a download code for a special weapon in the

02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:54.800
game.

02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:57.920
What's to stop me from going into Barnes and Noble and just copying the code from the book

02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:00.640
and running home and cashing it in before someone else can?

02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:01.640
Rude.

02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.120
Honestly, that was my thought as well.

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:09.120
Maybe they have it in plastic wrap or something and you, I don't know, set off alarms.

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:11.760
You'll set off an alarm if you break the seal.

02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:12.760
Exactly.

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:15.280
The master chief comes down and blows your head off.

02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:16.280
Close range.

02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:17.280
Oh, God.

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:18.280
Oh.

02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:21.040
Are you a big fan of Fable?

02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:22.560
I'm curious about this new game.

02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:23.560
I don't know.

02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:26.800
It didn't seem that different from 2 from what I played, but I heard they really improved

02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:27.800
co-op.

02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:31.720
I am really jealous that you did get to play it.

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:34.560
Yeah, I am a pretty big Fable fan.

02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:41.360
I'll tell you, when I played it kind, I ran around in a giant chicken suit for like 10

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.360
minutes and I had no idea what I was doing and I felt like I was playing Furries the

02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:46.360
game.

02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:49.040
It's because you were.

02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:52.560
That actually would be, you know, you like, look, like don't even lie listeners.

02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:56.560
You know, like if there were like a Furries the game, you'd have to check it out at least

02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:57.560
once.

02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:58.560
Like don't even judge.

02:39:58.560 --> 02:39:59.560
Oh yeah.

02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:00.560
Just the one time.

02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:01.560
Just the one time.

02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:05.600
Try to project onto our listeners, okay, just because you want to do it.

02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:07.200
I think it would be funny.

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:14.280
Yeah, funny and arousing.

02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:18.200
Do you think, do you think that there's enough Fable mythos out there and enough world that

02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:21.880
they've constructed out of the games that will make for pretty decent fantasy novels?

02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:25.040
Because, you know, it's not like novels for video games is anything too new.

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:27.480
I mean, Warcraft has a bunch of them.

02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:28.800
Even Halo has novels.

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:29.800
Resident Evil.

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:30.800
Resident Evil.

02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:35.040
There's a lot of games, the FX9 novels back in the day, Castlevania, Blaster Master, heck

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:36.040
yeah.

02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:38.280
Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:42.240
Is there enough substance in Fable to lend itself to books well, you think?

02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:45.120
There should be.

02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:50.640
And besides, they have someone from, I think it was Wizards of the Coast, writing the novel,

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:53.120
The Makers of Dungeons and Dragons.

02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:58.160
Oh, and now Irene likes Dungeons and Dragons, so maybe you should get, why don't you play

02:40:58.160 --> 02:40:59.160
Fable?

02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:00.160
It's actually kind of neat.

02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:02.120
Because I'm too busy playing D&D.

02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:03.120
What a good answer.

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.120
Well, you put me on the spot, okay, you asshole?

02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:09.120
That's what we do here on this show.

02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:13.520
Because it's expensive and not a lot of people have the money to turn off on a $60 game.

02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:15.200
Wait, what console is it for?

02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.400
It's for the Xbox 360, your favorite.

02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:18.400
There's your answer.

02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:19.400
Ding, ding, ding.

02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:22.160
It's not my fault you're poor.

02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:23.160
All right.

02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:24.160
It's not my fault you're an asshole.

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:25.160
All right.

02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:26.160
And you smell.

02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:28.520
Let's see what else I want to ask Kaim.

02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:29.520
I don't know.

02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:32.640
Kaim, quickly, anything else you're looking forward to this holiday season?

02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:37.640
All right, Fallout, Grinch News Plus 5, Fable 3.

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:45.240
Besides that, I'm not looking forward to anything until next year when Tell of Your Rising comes

02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:46.240
out.

02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:48.320
Ah, that is going to be a very popular game.

02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:51.080
So no interest in the motion control stuff.

02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:54.440
No Kinect, no Move in your future?

02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:59.280
When they come out with the Kinect feature in Fable 3, where I'm able to growth the other

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:00.280
player?

02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:01.280
Sure.

02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:02.280
All right.

02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.320
We'll leave it at that.

02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:06.320
Have a good one, Kaim.

02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:08.040
Thanks so much for the call.

02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.040
We'll see you around.

02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:10.040
All right.

02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:11.040
You guys take it easy.

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:12.040
Later.

02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:13.040
You too.

02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:14.040
Bye bye.

02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:15.040
Bye.

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:16.040
What's this private message you're sending me, DarkSakura?

02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:17.040
You have a microphone.

02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:18.040
You can just tell me.

02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:19.040
It's something that Tiara said.

02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:20.040
It's funny.

02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:21.040
You should read it.

02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:22.040
Also, there is Furries the game.

02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:23.680
It's called Worgen in the new WoW expansion.

02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:28.960
Actually, I was reading a really funny story on WoW.com about how apparently Worgens may

02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:31.960
not get a mount because Worgens will be the mount.

02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:32.960
We'll just run.

02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:33.960
Yeah.

02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:34.960
That's actually it.

02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:35.960
Worgens will be the mount.

02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:36.960
Okay.

02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:42.080
Which, WoW nerd, the Tauren actually had an ability called Planes Runner in the early

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:43.080
days of WoW.

02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:44.080
I remember that.

02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:45.080
That's right.

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:48.200
Where they could actually be the mounts themselves, but they were patched in with Kodos in a later

02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:49.200
expansion.

02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:51.400
Aren't Jeweds kind of like that too?

02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:53.840
Like they can just have their own flying shit?

02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:54.840
Yes.

02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:55.840
Okay.

02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:56.840
How about another call?

02:42:56.840 --> 02:42:57.840
You ready, Irene?

02:42:57.840 --> 02:42:58.840
Yes.

02:42:58.840 --> 02:42:59.840
Okay.

02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:00.840
Hi, Ryan.

02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:01.840
Oh, damn.

02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:02.840
What's up?

02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:03.840
Fuck you.

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.080
I'm booting you from the guild.

02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:06.080
Shut up.

02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:07.080
Whatever.

02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:08.080
Whatever.

02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.080
I'll G kick you quicker than you could me.

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:10.080
Oh.

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:11.080
In fact, look.

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:12.080
I'm on the game right now.

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:13.080
Okay.

02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:14.080
Hold on.

02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:15.080
Hold on.

02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:16.080
Hold on.

02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:17.080
Radio 101.

02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:18.080
Real quick, Irene.

02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:19.080
Even though their name comes up on the screen, you're supposed to, for radio's sake, just

02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:21.360
play stupid and say, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:22.360
Who is this?

02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:24.080
Even though you can clearly see his name is Ryan B.

02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:25.080
Whoa.

02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:26.080
Whoa.

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:27.080
Whoa.

02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:28.080
It sounds weird on the radio.

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:29.080
His name is Ryan B.

02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:30.080
What?

02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:31.080
Stop it.

02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:32.080
What?

02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:33.720
You have a two-way personal information there.

02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:35.360
I'm not going to give away the whole thing.

02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:39.600
I didn't say the whole thing, but take it off your Skype info.

02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:40.600
Yeah.

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:41.600
Sure.

02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:45.160
You can all see it in your studio.

02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:47.400
Because otherwise, you sound like Miss Cleo.

02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:48.400
Like-

02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:49.400
Go to me now.

02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:50.400
That's because I am Chad.

02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:51.400
I already know your name, Chad.

02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:52.400
How can I help you today, Ryan?

02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:56.960
And you're going to get booted out of the guild.

02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:59.840
Another reference that most of your listeners probably don't get, Rob.

02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:00.840
It's true.

02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:01.840
You're like, Miss Cleo, who?

02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:02.840
I know, right?

02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:03.840
Indeed.

02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:04.840
Anyway.

02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:05.840
Oh, sorry, Irene.

02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:06.840
Oh, yeah.

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:07.840
What do you want, Ryan?

02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:08.840
You.

02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:09.840
Gasp.

02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:10.840
Trauma.

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:15.200
Okay, so what do you really want, besides me, everyone?

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:16.200
Me.

02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:18.720
Oh, that's the truth right there.

02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:19.720
All right, come on.

02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:20.720
No, really.

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:21.720
What do you want?

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:22.720
Oh, no.

02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:26.680
I was just calling in to see how excited you are about Civ V coming out this coming Tuesday.

02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:33.080
You know, I am not excited to spend $50 on a game I'll probably play twice, because the

02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:38.600
stupid wow and all the stupid time sink I spent on that game.

02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:39.600
But I love my guildies.

02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.560
Yeah, I see how much you've been spending time on my gift for you.

02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:44.560
Well, right?

02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:47.600
Like, I don't- Do you know how much I played StarCraft II?

02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:48.600
Not enough.

02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:49.600
No, I understand that completely.

02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:50.600
Not enough.

02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:53.480
Very time consuming, especially with everything coming out now for it.

02:44:53.480 --> 02:45:01.040
The bummer with starting a late raiding schedule, like our guild did, is that now we don't have

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:05.520
that little- Usually, raiding kind of comes in cycles, and the content first comes out,

02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.040
you raid it a million times, and then it kind of dies off, and that's your time to go play

02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:10.040
other games.

02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:11.040
We haven't had that.

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.040
Yeah.

02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:15.360
So, if I want to go play other games- Like, you know what the word late and raid

02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:16.680
is all in the same sentence.

02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:21.560
I mean, you guys, what, eight o'clock your time, by the time I get out of it, it's about

02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:23.640
3.30 in the morning for me.

02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:25.600
Not my fault you joined the West Coast Guild.

02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:26.600
All right.

02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:27.600
Mm-hmm.

02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:32.320
Anyway, for the listeners that don't play WoW, is there anything else on your mind tonight?

02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:37.520
No, the whole- The good old gaming GOG, that's a whole rouge.

02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:41.360
We figured that out come by Wednesday when they announced that they're actually taking

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.400
their stuff out of beta and actually going live.

02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:48.720
There has been reports now that's claiming that it has been all been one big rouge, and

02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:52.240
now they're probably going to pay dearly for what they did to all their paying customers,

02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:53.240
so- Are they dicks or are they dicks?

02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:56.800
I hope they have something in store for them, because a lot of people are going to still

02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:59.400
be upset by all that, so.

02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:00.400
Are you going to be upset?

02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:03.240
Are you going to boycott their website, and I'm never shopping here again.

02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:04.240
No, not really.

02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:06.320
I never bought anything from them in the first place.

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:08.320
I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:10.960
I bet you, like, half of- I mean, a lot of the games that they have,

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:11.960
I already have.

02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.640
So, I mean, like, the Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, all the old games, I'll buy

02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:19.800
Jerky anyway, so I'm not even the least bit worried, so.

02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:20.800
Alright.

02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:22.080
But, you know, people are going to.

02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:23.080
People are going to be like that.

02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:24.680
People are going to be like, why did you pull this on us?

02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:25.680
We thought you were being real.

02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:31.200
A lot of people didn't know what was really going on, and now you do this, and it's like,

02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.200
well, you know, screw you.

02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.960
I'll find another place to buy the game or torrent or whatever, so.

02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:42.760
Tigerclaw in chat says, I'm, I'm, I think he, oh, I'm really curious to hear how Rob

02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:44.920
sounds like while playing WoW.

02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:46.000
I mean, how he acts.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.680
I hope it's not like that, a Nixxie, a white guy.

02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:53.280
How do I sound playing WoW, Ryan, since you've been on Ventrilo with me playing World of

02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:54.280
Warcraft?

02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:55.280
Day.

02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:56.280
Alright.

02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:57.280
No, I'm kidding.

02:46:57.280 --> 02:46:58.280
I'm kidding.

02:46:58.280 --> 02:46:59.280
No, you sound like you do now.

02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:00.280
No.

02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:02.280
It's, it's like we pretty much, you know, it's, it's normal.

02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:05.160
I mean, nobody gets really too, you know, crazy in there.

02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:08.280
And I like to do, I like to do my wacky DJ voice for, you know, the, the writers.

02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:10.120
No, you do not do your wacky DJ voice.

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:11.120
Hey, everybody!

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:13.120
Let's go to the Summoning Stone!

02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:14.120
Alright!

02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:19.200
Let's go over to Tasslehop for the traffic.

02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.200
Alright.

02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.440
Which is the best name ever, because Dragonlance is awesome.

02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.440
I didn't even do that.

02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:26.920
I didn't even try, I didn't even pretend to come back from that.

02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:27.920
I couldn't do that.

02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:28.920
Watch.

02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:29.920
I, but I couldn't.

02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:31.280
Wednesday, I'm going to do that, you know?

02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.320
Alright, you guys, it's eight o'clock.

02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:35.120
Let's all get to the Stone.

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.920
We're going to get some Leap Purples tonight.

02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:39.360
Tonight, we're going to get past the Blood Queen.

02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:40.360
Right after this.

02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:41.360
No, you're not.

02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:42.360
Alright.

02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:43.360
I'm hanging up on you.

02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:44.360
Alright, you too.

02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:45.360
Bye.

02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:46.360
Bye.

02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:47.360
Bye.

02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:48.360
I love wow calls.

02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:49.360
Me too.

02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:52.320
Because there's not enough wow chat on this show that I want to start a whole other wow

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.480
show, because there's not enough of them.

02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:58.880
SSJ, I hope, I hope there's people out there that would listen to a Robin X to her wow

02:47:58.880 --> 02:47:59.880
show.

02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:00.880
I might.

02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:01.880
I don't know.

02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:02.880
At least we'd have half a listener.

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:03.880
Aren't I confident?

02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:04.880
Yes.

02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:05.880
Alright, let's see.

02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:13.400
SSJ 100 Matt says, you should celebrate this call by having a cupcake.

02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:16.800
That's a total inside joke.

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:17.800
That's very rude.

02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:18.800
That's brilliant.

02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:19.800
That's very rude.

02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:20.800
You ready for another call?

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:21.800
Yes.

02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:22.800
Alright.

02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:25.560
Hi, you've reached Orange Slut Radio.

02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:26.560
Who is this?

02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:29.560
Hi, this is Nancy Neater.

02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:30.560
Hi.

02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:31.560
What's up?

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:40.840
Hey, well, I just want to pass along a little tidbit, a bit of information to whatever listeners

02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:44.720
there are out there that's not in chat.

02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:53.160
Basically, there's an anime show that I just discovered called Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.

02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:54.160
Just now?

02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:55.160
It's a...

02:48:55.160 --> 02:49:00.560
Hey, I just discovered Hoarders, and that's been on for like a year and a half, and I'm

02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:02.600
just finding out about it, so you know what?

02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:03.600
Back off.

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:04.600
Judging you.

02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.600
Sorry, continue.

02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:06.600
Sorry.

02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:15.640
Basically, I just discovered Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood myself, and it's basically like

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:25.080
a remake of an earlier show with the same name, and it's pretty damn good.

02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:34.760
In fact, I have no idea if it's on DVD or Blu-Ray or anything like that, but I happen

02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:41.920
to know that it is available for digital download.

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:49.560
If you want to risk going that route, again, I was complaining about digital download before,

02:49:49.560 --> 02:50:03.960
but at least right now, the first 13 episodes are actually on sale on PSN for 99 cents each.

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:12.840
It's cheap, but at the same time, if you guys have listened to my calls a few months ago,

02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:22.600
it's kind of a risk with digital download, so if you want to take the risk, go for it,

02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:26.280
or if you want to save some money, go ahead.

02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:32.680
You don't think it's worth the risk, then look for a physical copy.

02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:37.240
So all together to get the whole series, it's like 14 bucks basically, what, 13 episodes

02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:40.280
99 cents a pop?

02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:47.080
Really it's only the first half of the series that's on sale.

02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:48.080
I think there's like 25-

02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:50.000
Aha, that's how they get you.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.280
They sucker you in to buy the first half, and then they're like, oh, but the second

02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:56.960
half is double the price.

02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:57.960
Exactly like that, Rob.

02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:02.600
That's what they do at Sony headquarters.

02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:09.240
The weird thing is though, I'm not totally sure how Microsoft does their video marketplace.

02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:15.600
I really haven't used it yet, but I know at least over on PSN, a lot of times they'll

02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:23.920
have weekly sales on certain things, whatever's half off for that week, and a lot of times

02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:33.520
they even give away pilots to shows for free, and the whole thing, hey, this pilot that

02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:40.320
I got for free is good, might as well buy the rest of the series.

02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:51.680
But like I said, being here at risk if your system fucks up, there's a chance that unless

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:56.000
you play your cards right, you could lose out on the content that you bought.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.760
And you have to demand to speak to a supervisor, correct, based on what I learned in your previous

02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:03.800
calls about Sony trauma.

02:52:03.800 --> 02:52:14.960
Yeah, luckily, at least in the situations I've been in, I managed to work it out, but

02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:20.160
like I said earlier in the call, weigh out the pros and cons.

02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:23.240
I have a solution to all of your Microsoft problems, by the way.

02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:24.760
This is Sony problems, though.

02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:26.760
Sony problems, whatever.

02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:28.400
Hook up a computer to your TV.

02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:29.400
Seriously.

02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:31.200
No more problem.

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:32.200
It works for us.

02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:35.560
Okay, can I ask you a question?

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:37.040
Not to completely derail what you were saying.

02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:39.040
Where are you from?

02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:40.040
Buffalo, New York.

02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:41.040
Okay.

02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:44.040
I was trying to place your accent.

02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:52.360
Yeah, the weird thing is, my accent is not typical, though, because to get a little personal,

02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:54.240
I'm half Canadian.

02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:58.680
Everyone on my mother's side of the family is Canadian, and I spend a lot of time around

02:52:58.680 --> 02:52:59.680
my Canadian relatives.

02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:02.440
We don't like Canadians in these parts.

02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:10.800
Yeah, so my accent is a blend of the bothalonian accent and the Canadian accent.

02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:16.320
That's very cool, because I was actually thinking Great Lakes area, but that's actually kind

02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:17.320
of close.

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:20.520
I don't want no damn Tim Hortons in my backyard.

02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:25.760
I'm sorry to completely derail what you said, but I've been trying to place it for several

02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:26.760
calls now.

02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:29.720
I'm going to say goodbye to Spaznator for now, because we get to go wrap up.

02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:34.320
But Spaznator, thank you for the deal alert, and let's hope your PlayStation doesn't break

02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:35.320
again.

02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:36.320
Sure.

02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:37.320
Have a good one.

02:53:37.320 --> 02:53:38.320
You too.

02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:39.320
Thanks.

02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:40.520
So you go into our chat room with some comments.

02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:44.120
Derek H says, there's this anime called Robotech that I just found out about.

02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:46.120
It's pretty good and deserves to be popular.

02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:47.120
Aw, rude.

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:48.120
Aw.

02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:49.120
That's awful.

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:50.120
Awfully funny.

02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:51.120
Meanie.

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:54.640
No, he continues, whoa, did you guys know that they made a cartoon based on that Speed

02:53:54.640 --> 02:53:55.640
Racer movie?

02:53:55.640 --> 02:53:56.920
I just discovered it.

02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:57.920
That one made me a little for real.

02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:03.560
Did you know that there was this cartoon they made about a little boy called Adam Boy?

02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:08.400
Did you know that there's actually an old Battlestar Galactica that they did back in

02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:09.400
the 70s?

02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:10.400
Uh-uh.

02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:11.540
And Starbucks, a dude?

02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:12.540
You know what?

02:54:12.540 --> 02:54:14.360
I've never seen any of the new episodes, only the old ones.

02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:15.800
Oh, the new ones are actually really good.

02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:16.800
They're super good.

02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:17.800
I ain't lying.

02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:18.800
Starbucks cannot be a chick.

02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:19.800
And I love this.

02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:20.800
It's a coffee.

02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:26.400
Wait, this was my favorite comment during that whole call when Irene answered the call.

02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:29.360
Yzom says, orange slut radio discusses anime.

02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:31.920
Are you sure this is an orange virgin radio?

02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:36.600
No, it's orange anti-radio, orange tentacle rape radio.

02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:38.600
No, trust me, it's not.

02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:40.080
All right.

02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:43.040
R stands for rape.

02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:45.040
Wow.

02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:50.440
What is wrong with you?

02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:51.600
This show has just come to a switch call.

02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:53.800
That's horribly inappropriate.

02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:55.480
I was talking about tentacles.

02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:56.480
All right.

02:54:56.480 --> 02:54:59.560
I really apologize to those callers that didn't get through tonight, but we've got to go and

02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:00.800
wrap things up.

02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:02.280
And yeah, we're done.

02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:03.280
We're out of here for the night.

02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:04.280
It's nine o'clock.

02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:05.280
I got homework to do.

02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:06.280
That's right.

02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:09.120
So thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to Orange Laundry Radio.

02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:10.960
We really appreciate it, you guys.

02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:14.520
Of course, if you're listening on the podcast and you want to join us live sometime, please

02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:15.520
do.

02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:16.520
Sunday nights at All Games Radio.

02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:19.120
Just a heads up though, I'm going to be gone in two weeks.

02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:23.480
And I don't know if you really guys are doing, we're going to have a special, a special co-host

02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:24.480
via Skype.

02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:25.480
Oh, okay.

02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:28.480
I'm very curious to see how that show turns out.

02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:32.840
So make sure next week we show you how to click the buttons to go live and all that.

02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:33.840
Okay.

02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:34.840
You know how to do that.

02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:35.840
All right.

02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:36.840
Okay.

02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:37.840
I won't be here in two weeks.

02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:40.200
Mr. I didn't send anybody the iTunes information, so we had to figure it out for ourselves.

02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:41.200
Oh, I forgot.

02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:42.200
You don't know how I figured it out.

02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:43.200
It's okay.

02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:44.200
We figured it out.

02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:45.200
See, you're empowered women.

02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:46.200
You don't need no man's help.

02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:47.200
I didn't do it.

02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:48.200
Someone else did it.

02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:51.240
So, uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop for

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:52.240
the night.

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:57.520
Uh, first off rice princess, thank you very much for being here tonight and please come

02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:58.520
back.

02:55:58.520 --> 02:55:59.520
Okay.

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:00.520
The listeners.

02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:01.520
Love you.

02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:02.520
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:03.520
I hate you all.

02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:04.520
Fuck you.

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:05.520
I'm just kidding.

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.520
No, I really like you guys.

02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:08.520
You're cool.

02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:09.520
All right.

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:10.520
Cool.

02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:11.520
Ryan.

02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:12.520
I'm kicking you from the Guild.

02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:13.520
All right.

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.320
Ryan is here and give him the damn mic.

02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:19.320
Race princess.

02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:20.320
Oh, I'm the doctor.

02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:21.320
How's it going?

02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:22.320
Rob?

02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:23.320
Will you give him the microphone?

02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:24.320
This is the doctor.

02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:25.320
What you talking about?

02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:33.760
Did you see the latest advertisement about, you know, things and thank you so much for

02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:34.760
being here tonight.

02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:36.960
No, that's exactly how I sound.

02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:38.960
She got it very good.

02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:39.960
Indeed.

02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:40.960
See, I told you.

02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:41.960
Hey.

02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:50.640
What's the matter Rob?

02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:51.640
Dark Sakura.

02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:53.120
You have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:54.840
I hate algebra.

02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:55.840
Me too.

02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:56.840
Loki.

02:56:56.840 --> 02:56:57.840
Do you have a final thought tonight?

02:56:57.840 --> 02:56:58.840
I have to charge my devices.

02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:00.320
They're all dead now.

02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:01.480
Jerks.

02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:05.020
My final thought is I have to charge my life.

02:57:05.020 --> 02:57:06.360
It's dead now.

02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:07.360
That was deeper.

02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:08.360
I know, right?

02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:09.360
Okay.

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:10.360
Thank you guys so much for listening.

02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:11.360
We really appreciate it.

02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:12.360
Thank you for your support.

02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:15.920
If you like what you heard, all we ask, tell two people about the show.

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:17.400
Help us spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.

02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:21.060
If you don't have any friends, which I highly doubt, but you can always also leave us nice

02:57:21.060 --> 02:57:22.060
reviews on iTunes.

02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:23.240
We appreciate that.

02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:28.400
Or any other, you know, place that discusses podcasts, you know, by what, podcast alley

02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:29.400
or whatever.

02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:33.280
Just any place where they're discussing podcasts, say a good word or two and help us spread

02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:35.040
the word about Orange Launch Radio.

02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:39.120
If you didn't like what you heard here, then fine, but support independent radio.

02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:42.320
There's a lot of other great shows at All Games Radio that run throughout the week and

02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:43.320
just, you know, go to iTunes.

02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:48.320
There's like 50 billion podcasts out there, but try to download one that actually gets

02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:52.560
updated once a week or at least once a month because, you know, iTunes has some things

02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:55.240
that have been molding since 2007 still on the store.

02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:57.120
So, you know, just good luck with that.

02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:58.120
Yeah.

02:57:58.120 --> 02:57:59.120
Anyhow, thanks again.

02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.640
Have a wonderful night.

02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:01.640
We'll see you next week.

02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:04.640
We're going to do this all over again with more of Orange Launch Radio.

02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:11.640
Until then, good night.

02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:36.440
See you next week.
